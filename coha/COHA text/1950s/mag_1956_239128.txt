Of all the proposals tossed around during the warmup period of the campaign , two touch directly on the fundamental issue of U.S. security . These are Adlai Stevenson 's urgings that 1 ) the U.S. take the lead in ending H-bomb tests , and 2 ) the U.S. take steps to end the draft . Last week President Eisenhower replied in two prepared statements . Excerpts : <P> <P> Ending H-Bomb Tests . I speak as President , charged under the Constitution with responsibility for the defense and security of our nation . I therefore must point out the following essentials in our national policy : 1 ) The testing of atomic weapons to date has been-and continues-an indispensable part of our defense program . 2 ) As part of a general disarmament program , the American Government , at the same time , has consistently affirmed and reaffirmed its readiness-indeed , its strong will-to restrict and control both the testing and the use of nuclear weapons under specific and supervised international disarmament agreement . 3 ) In terms of our national weapons policy , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atomic Energy Commission , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and the President-to weigh , at all times , the proper emphasis on various types and sizes of weapons , their testing and development . Such emphasis is necessarily subject to constant review and reexamination . This specific matter is not a subject for detailed public discussion-for obvious security reasons . <P> The Stevenson proposals clearly take no account of what would be the result of stopping our tests . Tests of large weapons , by any nation , may be detected when they occur . But any such test follows many months of research and preparation . This means that elaborate tests could be prepared by another nation without our knowledge . By the time we had such knowledge , our present commanding lead could be reduced or even overtaken . <P> In the verbal confusion surrounding these proposals , an attempt has been made to cite , as having made " similar proposals , " great world figures , even including His Holiness Pope Pius XII . All these men-like this Government , like all responsible and thoughtful leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for international agreement allowing effective control of all armaments . <P> The Pope , in his last Christmas message to the world , urged " a check on experiments in nuclear weapons by means of an international agreement . " He stated that the matter involved " a question of three steps : renunciation of experimentation with atomic weapons , renunciation of the use of such , and general control of armaments . " And he called for " the sum total of those three precautions . " <P> <P> Ending the Draft . For 20 years or more our Government alternated between costly peaks in years of military crisis and starving valleys in years of apparent calm . Twice in this generation relaxations of America 's military strength have been followed by costly wars .
