In its " flying laboratory , " General Electric Co. gives striking proof of the power of a jet engine . To test a new jet G.E . slings it under the bomb bay of a heavy B29 . With its four 2,400-h.p. piston engines roaring , the bomber takes off and climbs to high altitude . Then the jet is started and its performance studied under varying conditions of speed , air density and temperature . <P> By this time , the power is so great that bomber 's regular engines have to be throttled down . When conditions are right , in fact , the engines can be stopped entirely and their propellers feathered . The single jet takes over and , unaided keeps the great bomber aloft .
