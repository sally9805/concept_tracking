From its first issue , six years ago , the magazine U.N . World was in the red , lost nearly a million dollars . It also veered briefly toward the red politically under its foreign-born editor , Louis Dolivet . He quit the magazine in 1950 , after he had gone to Europe and been barred from reentry by the U.S. Government . Two years ago U.N . World got an overhauling by its new publisher , Roger S. Phillips , 31 , scion of a wealthy Pennsylvania family ( Phillips Gas &; Oil Co. * ) . Phillips tried to make the magazine look less official ( it was never connected with the U.N. ) , spruced it up with more pictures , brighter writing and worldwide coverage . But when U.N . World went on losing money , Publisher Phillips folded it . <P> Last week , in its place , he put out a new , 72-page monthly named World . With an expanded staff , Phillips hopes to abolish the " visionary " outlook of his old magazine , give as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about international politics and business . The first issue has such articles as the " last message to the West " from Berlin 's late Mayor Reuter , Italian Industrialist Adriano Olivetti 's explanation of " How U.S. Aid Boomeranged in Italy , " and regular departments on investment abroad , the United Nations , " What 's Ahead , " etc . The first issue of the new magazine was warmly greeted by the internationally minded Christian Science Monitor . Said the Monitor : World " promises to be world-minded without being softheaded , to be liberal without being left , to be distinguished without being stuffy . " <P> <P> - Not to be confused with Phillips Petroleum Co.
