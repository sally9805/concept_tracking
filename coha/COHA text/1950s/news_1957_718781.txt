txt Letters to The Times To THIC EDITOR or TusNawYolucTimas : Prof. Morris D. Forkosch 's letter , published May 6 , was somewhat of a surprise . ' A professor of law should take eognizanee of legal precedents and digressions from precedent , which Professor Forkosch unfortunately does not do . America 's denunciation of a treaty with Russia fifty years ago because of that country 's discrimination against Americans of the Jewish faith is not in the least analogous to the case of Saudi Arabian discrimination . Russia 's discrimination was a unilateral act by the Czarist Government . America was t not a partner to the initial offense . In the case of Saudi Arabia , the discrimination against Americans of Jewish faith is clearly and undeniably implied in a bilateral agreement to which our Government is a partner . The State Department , by affixing its signature to a treaty containing the discriminatory clause , concurred in the principle of discrimination against American Jews , This , I submit , is wholly without precedent in American diplomatic history .. Earlier Treaty Let me cite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of how the United States behaved in the past . Article 3 of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States and the Ottoman Empire , May 7 , 1830 , reads : " American merchants established in the well-defended States of the Sublime Porte , for purposes of commerce , shall have liberty to employ Semsars ( brokers ) of any nation or religion , in like manner as merchants of oilier friendly powers ; and they shall not be disturbed in their affairs , nor shall they be treated , in any way , contrary to established usages . " Clearly there was nothing in this treaty that acknowledged the right of a foreign Government , at its pleasure , to discriminate against any group of Americans or individual Americans . This has been our policy throughout . To the best of my knowledge we have never , until recently , digressed from the policy . We have never before , explicitly or even implicitly , surrendered to the prep udices of a foreign Government . We have never before knowingly forfeited the principle of equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governments in treaty relations with the United States . Freedom for Nationals Article 2 of the Convention on American Rights in Syria and Lebanon , signed by the United States and France on April 4 , 1924 , provides that " Iwhe United States and its nationals shall have and enjoy all the rights and benefits secured under the terms of the mandate to members of the League of Nations and their nationals , " and Article 5 provides that " The nationals of the United States will be permitted freely to establish and maintain * * institutions * * * . " The Air Base Agreement with Saudi Arabia of 1951 , now revised and reaffirmed , for the first time in American diplomatic history concurred in the principle of discrimination between Americans which , in fact , means relegating a group of Americans to second-class ' citizenship . The clause reads " If the Saudi Arabian Government requests the mission to send out or replace any of its personnel or employes whom the Saudi Arabian Government does not desire to remain in the country , the mission will carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clause , to be sure . No Government should be permitted to accept or reject American personnel at its own pleasure . By permitting such a provision in our 1951 agreement with Saudi Arabia we place American rights at the mercy of foreign governments . JUDD L. TELLER . New York , May 6 , 1957 . Substitutes ' Pay Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wish to call attention to the unfair policy of the Board of Education in regard to substitute social workers and psychologists . These employes have unusually high academic and other qualifications . They are required to have at least ' one year of previous experience plus a master 's degree . Most of them have additional experience and academic preparation . They are required to wOrk full time , the same number of days as regular appointees . The working day for all Board of Education social workers and psychologists is longer than for teachers . When gpbstitute social workers and psychologists are absent they receive no sick leave . They are not covered by the pension system . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to work every day in the year he would receive $4,000 . A substitute psychologist would receive $4,200 . Unlike substitute teachers , substitute social workers and psychologists receive no credit for experience on the job ; that is , they do not receive automatic annual increments . Regularly appointed social workers receive 44,750 the first year ; To THE EDITOR OF THENew York TIMES : Your recent editorial with respect to the plight of business people swh$ have to move as a result of dislocation because of public housing was commendable . The stark reality of confiscation confronts the average business man today . An example of this may be seen in the condemnation of the block bounded by West 155th Street , Amsterdam Avenue , West 156th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue for a public school . There are some twentyfour businesses in this location , one having paid as much as $126,000 for key money . Six months ago another business man purchased a business on this same site for $33,000 . As a result of condemnation these business people will be able to obtain only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred dollars . In many instances the life savings of families are lost . No Prior Notice The proposed school site for P. S. 28 , Manhattan , was chosen without notice to the business people in the community . Not a single one received any notice of any prospective school taking and this in a case where the life savings of such people are involved . Yet across the street is a site consisting mainly of bojrded-up buildings and a vacant lot , which would have been ideal for the purpo le and would remove a blight from the neighborhood . The removal of business seitions of tie community also results in the loss of tens of thousands of dollars in actual revienue to the city . ? There are at times unnecessary . wasteful expenditures of the city 's money in the field of condemnation even with a helpful and conscientious Mayor and 13 , oard of Estimate . There may be erroneous or inaccurate reports upon ' which the board May act . In one particular case , despite a Deport of the city 's Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Expedite School Construction Program , he commending an alternative site which indicated a saving of several hundred dollars or more and required much less in residential tenant relocation , a site was selected which affects business people . Saudi Agreement Opposed Placing American Rights at Mercy of Foreign Governments Charged The writer of this letter is the author of the forthcoming " The Kremlin , the Jews and the Middle East " and other works . psychologists $5,166 . A. teacher with comparable experience and academe is qualifications receives $4,840 . All regular appointees receive sftic leave , pension rights and annual increments . Substitute social workers and psy ? chologists accept these positions to gain experience or to mark time until they can get something better . In the meantime the board takes advantage of their difficult situation by paying them less than any other , employes with comparable qualifications . Since the " cost " of correcting this injustice is quite small , it is difficult to understand why the Board of Education does not take appropriate action . CHARLES COGEN , President , New York Teachers Guild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Businesses Condemnation of Areas for Public Use Said to Work Hardships Study Urged Payments of moving costs of $500 or even up to $2,000 are simply not enough . A study Auld be made of the entire field of condemnaticp , whether it be for public housing or schools , and the entire concept of fair compensation should be reevaluated in terms of modern conditions . With respect to business people , the ambit of damages should be broadened so as to include not only moving expenses but loss of income , goodwill , interruption ? of business damages , cost of reinstallation of equipment and other kindred items . Only then will a guarantee of just compensation , allegedly protected by the Constitutions of ' the State of New York and of the United States , be realized and ndemnation become an instrument of justice rather than one of confiscation for the average business man . SIDNEY Z. SEARLES . New York , ' May 3 , 1957 . Comparison With Richelieu To Tilt : EDITOR OF ' THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his column of May 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 " C. L. Sulzberger compare* Abdel Rahman Azzam , former Secretary of the Arab League , with Cardinal Richelieu . Mr. Sulzberger seems to imply that Azzam is the " Gray Eminence " of the Arab political world just as Cardinal Richelieu was to French politics . The term " His Gray Eminence " is not properly applied to Richelieu , but to his contemporary and confidant , the Capuchin Friar Pere Joseph du Tremblay . ( Rev. ) HUGH MORLEY , 0 . F. M. Capuchin .
