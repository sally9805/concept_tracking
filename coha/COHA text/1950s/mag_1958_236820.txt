From the moment he trotted onto the track , Silky Sullivan must have known he was on the spot . California horseplayers knew what the implausible chestnut could do . They had seen him before , loafing while a fast field stole a 40-length lead , then blazing into the stretch-and a narrow victory-as though his tail were on fire . Could he do it again ? This was the $130,500 Santa Anita Derby , and Silky was up against nine swift three-year-olds , including Old Pueblo , the last one to beat him . If he lost this time , people might suspect he was only a horse after all . <P> For months they had suspected that he was something more . " I 've seen the act in vaudeville , " said awed ex-Vaudevillian Charley Foy . " It 's two guys on roller skates . " Chimed in a breed-improver named Georgie Jessel : " His name is n't Sullivan at all . He 's Silky Solomon . I knew him in Philadelphia . " <P> Good Doer . No sooner had the ten-horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Silky 's strongest boosters began to worry about his form . Their favorite was only 28 lengths behind the leaders-for him that was hot pursuit . Maybe he was burning himself out early . But Silky had plenty in reserve . When the field carried wide on the stretch turn , he wove and darted toward the rail with the sure-footed skill of an All-American halfback . Silky shot under the wire a widening three lengths in front of his stablemate , Harcall . Said Harcall 's jockey , Bill Boland : " He ran by me so fast , he darn near sucked me under . " <P> Satisfied at last that Silky was a legitimate sensation , the form followers were still trying to figure out how he did it . With his breeding he should not have the staying power to finish a mile-and-a-furlong derby with a sprint . His sire , the Irish-bred Sullivan , seldom lasted more than a mile ; his dam . Lady N Silk , also seemed mere horseflesh . With his build , Silky hardly looks like a thoroughbred at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percheron and the broad chest of a Turkish wrestler . He clops solidly up to the starting gate as if he were there only to pull it into position . Indeed , Silky is a horse out of Bunyan by Runyon . <P> At the oat pail , Silky is what stablemen call a " good doer . " He eats like a horse . But the feed never turns to fat ; it only stokes Silky 's fires . He burns it up according to the dictates of his own four-footed psyche ; his jockey is only along for the ride . He breaks from the gate like a common sprinter , races 70 yds. , then lags as if his safety valve had popped . Wags in the press box contend that he is a ham who hates to leave the grandstand . And it is a heart-stopping fact to bettors that he begins to run again only when he rounds the stretch turn and heads for the crowd again . Says Co-Owner Tom Ross : " I swear , he counts the house . " <P> Bad Risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stopwatch specialists who have heard him come back from a workout wheezing like an equine asthmatic . Silky 's outraged owners brush off such canards . They admit no more than that their horse is a " roarer , " i.e. , an animal who clears his ears , nose and throat with a sound like a bull alligator with his tail caught in a trap . They have other health problems on their minds . Each of the two owners is a cardiac case .
