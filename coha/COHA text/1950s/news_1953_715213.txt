txt Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central have come up with an idea they think will save time for train travelers when they buy tickets and make Pullman and coach reservations . The Pennsy plans to put the new system to use at its Pittsburgh station about March 1 and if all goes well extend it to other cities . New York Central is going to try the same scheme . a month later in Cleveland . It 'll work like this : A modernistic. semicircular ticket sales and service counter will be set up in the middle of the station  --  consolidating the separate ticket windows and the reserifation department . Pre-printed Pullman and reserved coach space coupons  --  one for each unit of reserved space on trains leaving the two stations ? will be arranged on special racks according to train and date . To catch the traveler 's eye , coupons for each type of ride will be printed a distinct color . Then , too , a board in full view of the public will show accommodations available on each train for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pittsburgher " for New York at any time during the week , for instance . can tell by a glance at the board whether it is available . If it is n't , the board will show him what he can get . Result of all this , the two carriers think . will be considerable speeding up of the whole business of tram trip arranging . Present bottlenecks that arise from ticket sellers trying to communicate with the reservation bureau and vice versa will be eliminated , they say . Service will be quickened too , because clerks wo n't have the tedious task of writing in destination and other data on tickets , for the space coupons will all be prepared beforehand by automatic machines . Pittsburgh and Cleveland passengers who have to buy long rides over more than one railroad will be provided with a special service lounge . The new ticket and reservation system was developed by Robert Heller &; Associates of Cleveland in collaboration with the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
