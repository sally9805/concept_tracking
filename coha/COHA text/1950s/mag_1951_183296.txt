" I 'll Kill You if You Scream " <P> Warren Lee Irwin was a fellow with a screw loose in his head . He stole , lusted continuously after women , and was inclined to kill people who stood in the way of his scheme of things . At 27 he was a hardened jailbird . In the 13 months since getting out on parole ( from Michigan sentences as an habitual criminal ) , he was believed to have murdered one woman , kidnaped another , and to have killed a Michigan gas-station attendant . <P> He was a harmless-looking sort-he had the severe mouth , high forehead and martyred gaze of a divinity student ; he was nearsighted , and wore rimless spectacles . No cop bothered him as he wandered toward the Washington Monument in the national capital one evening last week , with a .38 revolver and a roll of adhesive tape in his pocket . Though it was still light , he ducked , unnoticed , into the front seat of a parked sedan . <P> Unseeing Search . A pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car with her boy friend , 19-year-old Lawrence Gilbert . The pair-interrupted just as the boy had presented an engagement ring-were too startled to utter a sound . Irwin yanked out his pistol . " Drive me to Virginia , " he said , dramatically , " the FBI is after me . " <P> The car had gear trouble ; as it ground slowly across the Potomac , Irwin cursed impatiently , talked of his crimes , and threatened to kill " many people " if he was not obeyed . Finally he ordered a stop on a dirt road , and forced the girl to tape her fianc 's hands . Then Irwin raped her . Afterward , with a weird kind of reasonableness , he freed the boy , walked the pair to a gas station and bought them Cokes . <P> " If you talk about this before midnight , " he said , " I 'll kill the girl . " He turned Gilbert loose , and got on a Washington-bound bus with Carolyn . " I know a cheap hotel , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When they walked into the lobby , she winked desperately at a lounging marine ; the marine simply winked back . She wept when Irwin shut the door of their room . She was forced to submit to him four more times during the night . <P> When the pair emerged on the street the next morning , the Washington cops were scouring the city for them ; young Gilbert had gotten to a police station by 8 a.m. , had pointed to Irwin 's picture on a " Wanted " poster , and told the whole story . Yet no one spotted the fugitive and his captive . Irwin hocked Gilbert 's watch and the engagement ring for $15 , and forced the girl into a bus . Irwin grew confidential again . He was going to rob a rich uncle in Doylestown , Pa. and " give you a car . " <P> " Hello , Uncle . " The uncle , an engineer named George Brewer , yielded up no money . Irwin forced his way into the Brewer house , pistol in hand , crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Brewer and his fearful wife obeyed . But nothing happened-Irwin just sat down too . The girl wobbled to the davenport , and fell asleep . When she woke up the next morning all three were still sitting motionless in the same chairs . Irwin hustled her into the Brewer 's Oldsmobile sedan and drove off . He pulled up at a rural cornfield , raped her again , taped one of his wrists to hers and slept for an hour .
