New Assault on the Consumer <P> TO U.S. merchandisers , the key to bigger sales is a new pseudo science that analyzes the U.S. housewife 's whims with equal parts of salesmanship , psychology , hypnotism and common sense . Its name : impulse buying . The idea is not new , but with the rise of self-service supermarkets , super drug and variety stores , there is a greater incentive than ever before to encourage shoppers to throw away their shopping lists and buy more than they ever intended . <P> Despite all talk about price as the great determinant , low cost is the major factor for barely 16% of all shoppers ; studies also show that another 16% shop only for heavily advertised brands . In between ranges the vast middle ground of shoppers , fair game for the motivational researchers , who take dead aim with all the analytical gimmicks under the supermarket sun . They claim , for instance , that the undecided mass of supermarket shoppers - they call them " emotionally insecure " - really do not know what they want when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have bought right up to the cash registers . In tests , researchers paid for housewives ' purchases , led them to another market and asked them to shop again for the week 's groceries . There the women bought an entirely different basket of goods . Such tests have persuaded stores to stay open at night to enmesh the undecided male as well as the female . A couple shopping together buys 60% more than the man alone , 30% more than the wife alone . <P> Most supermarket chains have merchandising committees to figure out ways to present and sell the best of the 150 new products flooding into the market each week . Once , grocers could depend on personal service to push a product ; today , with the rise of the self-service market , the business has about 1,500,000 fewer clerks than it would otherwise need . What sells is what appeals to the shopper 's impulse : the color , the size , the shape , even the shelf position of the package . Years ago , only comparatively few companies worried about their labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libby was having trouble selling baked beans until it changed the label to a rich , dark color , emblematic of the molasses-smothered beans inside , has since redesigned nearly all its 250 labels . One manufacturer put out cotton-tipped swabs in three colors : white , pink and chartreuse . White and pink were fine ; chartreuse flopped because it reminded women of baby 's soiled diapers . In many cases the brighter-and sometimes the more incongruous-the package , the greater the appeal . California 's Thoro-fed Dog Food watched sales jump 40% when it wrapped Fido 's dinner in gleaming gold foil . Among the new gimmicks : multiple-unit " specials , " with three , six and twelve items in a pack . One Midwest chain reports that it sold only nine cans of sauerkraut a week at a dime apiece , but 441 cans priced at ten cans for $1 . A West Coast petfood packer sells more three-can packages priced at 29 than three individual cans priced at 9 apiece .                @ @ @ @ @
