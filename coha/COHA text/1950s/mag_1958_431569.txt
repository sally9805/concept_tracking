 | When the Teacher Calls it " Social Studies " When you were in school , you probably studied history . The chances are that your child is enrolled , instead , in a course called " social studies . " What is the difference ? And does the new generation stand to gain or lose by the substi-tution ? In many schools , no real change has occurred . History is still being taught , is different . In other schools , and nothing but the label however , a great deal has happened , and the changes constitute a serious weakening of the school program . Moreover , the switching of labels has in itself done considerable harm , for parents now find it difficult to discover what is really being taught in this area , so vitally important for good citizenship . " History " is a clear-cut term , describing a wellunderstood subject of instruction . By contrast , the phrase " social studies " possesses no definite or certain meaning . It can be given a reputable definition : " the entire group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies . " So defined , it embraces history , geography , economics , political science , anthropology , sociology , jurisprudence , and social psychology . This is a formidable array of specialized disciplines , each with its particular techniques of investigation , its theoretical formulations , and its voluminous literature . In the learned world , a certain number of scholars are working on the interconnections of these different fields ; few would claim anything like competence in more than two or three . Teacher-training programs in the United States allow barely enough time to enable a teacher to become familiar , at the level of a college undergraduate , with one of these fields . To ask a teacher to cover them all is to invite superficial and irresponsible teaching . In constructing a course or a program in the social studies , furthermore , little scholarly guidance is available , and no established standards exist . Everyone has 18 his own idea about what social studies ought to include ; hence , teachers and administrators are free to add or subtract topics as they please . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to do at the end of even twelve years of elementary- and high-school work in the social studies . In each of the separate fields ? history , geography , and political science , for example ? a consensus exists with respect to bodies of knowledge that are fundamental . When all are thrown into a hodgepodge. however , the possibility of fixing minimum standards of understanding and competence vanishes . The fad of social studies in American schools does not constitute a new organization of the curriculum ; it constitutes a new and dangerous disorganization . Worst of all , topics that have no conceivable relationship to the social sciences ( as scholars understand the term ) are being pushed into the social-studies curriculum , simply because the word " social " can somehow be applied to them . This is particularly true where a so-called " problem approach " is used . Take , for example , the following collection of topics , offered in one California high school . I quote the principal 's own description : " Our present plans call for three problems courses during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with the ten units of work covering the State requirements of Morals and Manners , Civic Responsibility , Alcohol and Narcotics ; ( 2 ) Sophomore problems with five or six units of work covering Driver Education , First Aid , Accident Prevention and World History ; and ( 3 ) Senior problems with units of work covering Civics , Psychology and Sociology and other problems facing the eighteen-year-old . " The argument that the social studies should replace history , geography , and political science ( I am not speaking here of instances where a mere change of label is involved ) boils down to the argument that the new approach will better prepare citizens to deal with the problems ? political , social , and economic ? of their own day . This argument must be met on its own ground , for no one would dream of denying that a well-educated young man or woman should be equipped by his education ( Continued on page 212 ) @# @#  | to deal intelligently with such questions Indeed , each of the established and traditional disciplines came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more effectively the problems arising within its sphere . Economics , for example , exists and is respected because men have found that its systematic methods of analysis are appropriate and useful in wrestling with economic problems . Political science has proved its value in handling problems connected with the structure and administration of government . And for two thousand years , history has been the recognized school of good citizenship . One commentator on the ancient historian Thucydides put the matter thus : " The statesman , the patriot , the friend to liberty and reason will be better enabled to plan and to regulate his own measures , when he can see the tende and consequence o @#  | . Advocates of the social-studies approach promise to accomplish all these things , and to accomplish them better . They propose to do so by breaking down the supposed " barriers " between the different fields and by concentrating the student 's attention on contemporary , rather than historical , problems . They decry as old-fashioned the systematic study of each field ? the chronological study of history . for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures and theories in the way the political scientist analyzes them . Instead , the advocates of social studies expect students to pick up the principles of the various disciplines casually , as they encounter them in " problem-solving " situations . THAT well-educated , thoughtful citizens can be produced in this haphazard , hit-or-miss fashion is surely one of the most preposterous theories current in American education . When the social-studies approach is pushed to its logical extreme , graduates tend to have a smattering of knowledge about everything in general , but a clear and usable knowledge of nothing in particular . They have been on numerous field trips , to factories , housing projects , and government offices , and they have aired their opinions in discussions of current public problems . All these would have been fine as extracurricular activities . In the classroom , however , these young people have rarely worked in a continuous and orderly way to acquire mastery of any of the genuine tools of thought . They have looked at problems with economic aspects , but they have never learned to analyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They know a few provisions of the Constitution , but they never think about the Constitution as the product of a distinctive and consistent theory of government ; nor can they point out clearly the logical differences between its principles and those of alternate systems . Far from having been trained to study contemporary problems , they have been misled into believing they can go right ahead to solve contemporary problems through a round of group discussions , without benefit of precise knowledge , logical analysis , or historical understanding . The idea of pushing history aside to concentrate on contemporary problems may be plausible until one begins to think about it . Then one realizes that there is no such thing . strictly speaking , as a contemporary problem . Social and political problems do not , in fact , burst on us in any such sudden manner . They arise and alter and develop over long periods . To understand how they came into existence is usually the most important step in grappling with them . Take , for example . the crisis over racial integration in Little Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have been studied in many high schools . How can it be understood except in historical terms ? How can anyone discuss this matter @#  | intelligently , let alone plan a future course of action , without knowing the history of slavery , of the Civil War and Reconstruction , and of the Fourteenth Amendment of 1868. on which the Constitutional issue in Little Rock hinges ? Or , to take another example , what understanding can one have of current problems in France without knowledge of the French Revolution and the bitter divisions it produced , and some comprehension of the situations that enabled two Napoleons to rise to power on the ruins of earlier French republics ? It will be argued , of course , that a student learns more by solving a contemporary problem than by studying one that time has already solved . This argument is largely nonsense . A student does not solve a contemporary problem . At best , he merely clarifies his own opinions ( or borrows his teacher 's ) concerning the way the problem might be or ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the returns may not be in until after he is dead . The reasoning behind his conclusions can not be tested , either . His logic may look good enough on paper , but only the future can tell whether or not he has correctly estimated the factors at work and whether or not he has left out of his calculations certain historical forces that may in the end prove decisive . It is the problem of the historical kind ( and the historian is as much a problem-solver as anyone else ) that furnishes truly rigorous training in the handling of social and political problems . There is , after all , an answer sheet . The student can enter into the problem as contemporaries entered into it . But he knows more than contemporaries could have known . , He knows the consequences of the lines of action proposed and pursued . He knows what finally happened . WISE citizenship without a sense of history is no more possible than wise navigation without a compass . The central question for education is whether this understanding of history is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . or whether we may count on their picking up a sense of history as a result of casual encounters with snippets of historical data , presented merely as a background to one or another contemporary problem . No other nation is gambling the future of its institutions on the absurd expectation that the latter program ( if anything so haphazard can be called a program ) will work . Elsewhere , the systematic study of history as history is a basic part of every elementary- and secondary-school curriculum . In the United States , we are gravely imperiling our fundamental traditions of freedom ? which require historical understanding for their proper appreciation and defense ? by permitting educational theorists and administrators to curtail , to disguise , and to disorganize the study of history in our schools .
