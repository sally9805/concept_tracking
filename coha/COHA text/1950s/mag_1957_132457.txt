25-YEAR FOOTBALL SCOREBOARD // Here is a list of the 15 winningest college football teams of the past 25 years . Georgia Tech ranks 12th in won-lost percentage , but the Engineers ' victory total ties that of Duke for fourth place . // TEAM // WON // LOST // TIED // PCT. // Notre Dame // 178 // 46 // 14 // .795 // Tennessee // 184 // 53 // 12 // .776 // Oklahoma // 177 // 54 // 17 // .766 // Duke // 169 // 58 // 11 // .744 // Michigan St. // 150 // 53 // 12 // .739 // Army // 160 // 57 // 14 // .737 // Ohio State // 147 // 58 // 12 // .717 // Michigan // 152 // 62 // 6 // .710 // Alabama // 161 // 68 // 15 // .703 // USC // 158 // 78 // 21 // .669 // Princeton // 126 // 63 // 11 // .667 // Georgia Tech // 169 // 86 // 9 // .663 // Boston Col. // 125 // 64 // 14 // .661 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Penn State // 128 // 75 // 11 // .657 // Life Has treated Robert E. Lee Dodd , the gentleman with the cautious smile on the opposite page , rather handsomely . Only last year , the alumni of Georgia Institute of Technology , where Dodd is head football coach and athletic director , bought him a $50,000 home . It is his as long as he remains athletic director , a job which carries a lifetime tenure if Dodd wants it . Also , Dodd gets a new car every year , thanks to the alumni , simply because they like him personally and appreciate his value as the caretaker of Georgia Tech 's long and extraordinarily successful football tradition , of which the Institute is justifiably proud . // In the past 25 years Georgia Tech has won 169 games . Only three major teams have won more in this period . Bobby Dodd was at Tech every one of those years  --  the first 13 of them as an assistant to W. A. ( Bill ) Alexander . Since becoming the third head coach in Tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost 28 , tied four . // " Practice this week in preparation for the Tigers will be the same as for any other game , " says Dodd . " We 'll throw some passes , run some plays , kick the ball around and have some fun . Low pressure all the way . And on Saturday the kids will be ready . " // The " kids " are one of the real anomalies in big-time college football . Because of Tech 's high academic standards their football players must be scholars in fact as well as name . This keeps many of the beefy tackle types away from Tech and has forced Dodd to replace size with speed . Yet Dodd makes his system work in one of the toughest conferences in the country  --  the Southeastern . // Even this year , while Dodd is rebuilding after losing nine starters from last year 's Gator Bowl champions , his Yellow Jackets are again a team to be feared as much as any in the South . Their record so far would not bear this out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a tie with SMU and last Saturday 's stunning 20-13 loss to Louisiana State . On Saturday , Tech tangles with the undefeated Auburn Tigers , recent victors over Tennessee , and the form says that Auburn is bound to win this , its last serious obstacle on the road to its first Southeastern title . However , the form can be grievously wrong when it comes to sizing up the quick , smart , opportunistic teams that year after year are machined on the lathe of Bobby Dodd . For he is full of surprises as well as contradictions . // Without football Dodd would probably have wound up just another guy from Kingsport , Tennessee . So it was surprising to hear him warn the other day that he might lead a movement to put an end to intercollegiate football ; cut off the hand that feeds him . // " Recruiting has gotten too far out of hand , " he explained . He sat , feet propped up on his glass-topped desk , surrounded by a battery of cream-colored telephones . Occasionally one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note information . // " Illegal recruiting , " he continued , " I mean the kind where a coach will go out and offer a kid the world with a fence around it  --  it 's going to ruin football . It 's bad enough now , and if it gets any worse I 'll have to stand up and say , ' Let 's get rid of intercollegiate football . Let 's play on an intramural basis . But let 's play it honest . ' " // Nevertheless , a great deal of Dodd 's success as a coach stems from his ability to recruit football players ; to get outstanding high school stars to come to Tech . " Sure , " he admits , " we recruit here . But I ca n't think of one instance where we ever got a boy using unethical tactics . We offer them what the Southeastern Conference allows . A kid comes here , he gets his tuition , books , meals , a place to sleep and a little laundry money , and if he spends the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the month . // " Now , there are some schools in this conference , " said Dodd , " and other conferences , too , that go beyond the rules . They 'll offer a boy money ; they 'll help his parents with the mortgage ; they 'll buy him fancy clothes even when he 's still in high school . Actually what these coaches are doing is offering kids bribes . They teach a ballplayer while he 's still young and fairly impressionable to be ' on the take . ' So what happens ? The kid starts going around with his hand out all the time . And , normally , he 'll remember this lesson better than anything else he 'll learn in college . Take , take , take . Do n't give anything for nothing . There are enough schools out recruiting with good hard cash to make me think that if we ca n't stop illegal recruiting maybe we ought to stop football . " // Dodd screwed up his deeply lined face and chewed thoughtfully on an unlit cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't start cleaning on their own , they 're going to be in trouble , " he went on . " College presidents and alumni , people like that are n't going to stand for any more scandals . Why I was shocked myself this morning just going over the NCAA list of schools on probation for illegal practices . There must be at least 10 . Of the 10 schools on NCAA probation , eight are there for illegal recruiting . Down here in the Southeastern Conference we have a recruiting deadline . We ca n't sign a boy to a scholarship until midnight , December 7 . You know what some of the coaches do to get a kid ? They 'll take them off to the mountains on a fishing trip and hide them out for a few days before the deadline . Then they sign them right at midnight and the fishing trip is over . It almost amounts to kidnapping . We 've never done that here at Tech . In fact , it has been rare that we 've signed anybody right on the deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and that was because he asked me to . He said it would save him from being pestered all night by other schools . // " Some schools go all over the country to get players . Here at Tech , we try to get the local boy . I believe if you have local boys you will have a better team . Me , for instance , I can talk to a boy from this area in my language and he 'll understand me . We have something in common . A kid from up North  --  well , it 's just not the same . I can take a boy from the Southeast and fire him up so he 'll play 110% of what he 's capable . Now I do n't know why it should be that way , but it is. // " Another funny thing . Generally , a southern boy has n't got the physical size that kids from Pennsylvania or Texas or the Midwest have . But they 've got this unbelievable spirit and willingness . I think you get a bunch together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better together because they have this common background  --  a common understanding  --  that makes for better teamwork . Anyhow , we try to get the local boy . // " We rely on Tech 's scholastic and football records as the persuader . And , of course , public relations . A coach , he 's got to be a public relations man , a salesman . You have a product to sell  --  in this case , Georgia Tech  --  and you go out and sell it the best way you know how . Technical education is a big help . We turn out engineers . Everyone wants to hire engineers . The kids , they get jobs a year before they get out of school and they make good money . And you 've got to realize that our football tradition helps , too . We 've been in six bowls the last six years . Won every one of them . Been in eight bowls since I became head coach 12 years ago . I think kids like a winner . " // ON TO TENNESSEE // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went from Kingsport High to the University of Tennessee , where General Robert Neyland , then the dean of southern football , was glad to have him . With Dodd , a slight 155-pounder , as quarterback , Tennessee was undefeated in 1928 and 1929 , although tied each season by Kentucky , and in 1930 they lost only to Alabama . Bobby was chosen as All-America in 1930 . The next season he went to Tech as assistant to Coach Alexander . // From Neyland , Dodd learned precision . " The General , " said Bobby , " was the greatest planner I ever met in football . I remember in 1929 he wanted to put in a trick play for the Vanderbilt game . I was to fake a handoff , back into the line with the ball hidden in my lap and then , just as soon as I saw daylight , turn and run fast as I could . I argued with the General about how far I could run without being caught . I said 50 yards . He said 20 . During the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Vandy 's 20 . It worked and I got loose . They tackled me right on the goal line . The General had it figured to the yard , and just sort of winked at me after the game was over . " // Always one step ahead of his opposition as a strategist , Dodd believes that the multiple offense soon will replace the T as the standard college offense . " Multiple offense is the coming thing , " he said . " We 're beginning to use unbalanced lines left and right with flankers and split ends . Sort of like the pro offense . Of course , you can never get as wide-open as the pros with college rules . The pros , they can play platoon football . They can afford to have the guy who can throw the running pass but ca n't tackle . They can have the end with the great hands who could n't bust up a sweep if it came right at him . In college where you have to have boys who can play both ways  --  offense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't develop the degree of skill that is absolutely necessary for a wide-open game . But I do think that the T or split-T as a basic college formation is a thing of the past . I think you 'll find more and more college teams turning to some form of multiple next year , " he said . // " Vanderbilt , now . Vanderbilt runs something they call the variegated T , " he went on . " It 's just their own name for it . We run practically the same thing but we call it the multiple T. I think Vandy and Tech are the only two teams playing out of a multiple in the South this year , but next year you 'll see a lot more of the same thing . The T and the split-T have been defensed almost to the saturation point , so you 've got to change your offense to keep the defense guessing . The multiple T accomplished this . " // Dodd , in other words , tends to regard football strategy in terms of the well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense to defense and then back again . As one of the most distinguished football strategists , he illustrated this with his own experience at Tech . " Anything new , like the belly series we started a few years ago , turns into a monster on you after a while , " he pointed out . " And one day we 'll come up against a team that will have developed a defense for the multiple and they 'll probably rack us up . But we 'll still be ahead of the game because the next week we 'll be able to look at the movies of the game , see how we were defensed and we 'll have the answer right quick without having to waste all that time experimenting on how to stop the multiple . You let the other team do the work for you and you always stay ahead of them . " // Like most head coaches today , Dodd does very little actual coaching himself . " Most of the coaching I do is with my staff , " says Dodd . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go over what I want them to do with the team that day . The method is mine . The technique is mine . But the actual teaching , that 's something else . Oh , I 'll get out there and show a boy how to punt or how to quarterback . These are the things I 'm best at . But how to throw a brush block , or how to block downfield or how to tackle  --  I 've got specialists on my staff to teach these things , and they teach them better than I ever possibly could . Coaching nowadays is a complicated proposition . When I played at Tennessee , General Neyland had two assistants and that was it . Times have changed since then . I 've got anywhere from 16 to 19 coaches out working with the squad every day . You have to have offensive specialists and defensive specialists . Sort of two-platoon coaching . The head coach  --  he spends most of his time talking to quarterback clubs , answering phone calls from alumni , making personal appearances , talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field on a Saturday afternoon . " // Though Dodd is only 48 , there are always rumors that he will give up coaching and become full-time athletic director , yielding the Tech eleven to Assistant Head Coach Ray Graves . // " There 's always stories about me going to quit , " laughs Dodd . " I 'm only 48 and I 've got a lot of years left . But I 'll tell you this . I 've been in this game too long to have to start taking a lot of guff from people because we 've had a bad season . The day the complaints start coming in about Bobby Dodd , that 's the day I quit . I figure it takes about two bad seasons to get people down on you . Then they start yelling and calling you names . Well , just as soon as that starts happening , I 'm through . I 'll just step down and let Ray Graves take over . But as long as things are going right  --  and they seem to be  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . And I like it . " // Dodd rubbed the bridge of his battered nose tenderly . It had been broken years ago when he was an undergraduate at Tennessee . Oddly enough , the injury was not suffered in football , but in basketball . " Vance Maree , " Dodd laughed . " That old son of a gun Vance Maree busted my nose . We come down to Atlanta to play Tech in basketball . I was a guard . Vance  --  now he was a great football player , a tackle on Tech 's Rose Bowl team  --  but at basketball he was nothin ' at all . Well , he come up and whopped me on the nose with his elbow or something , and I went off on queer street for a minute or two . One of the trainers plugged my nose with cotton and we went on with the game . We beat Tech  --  I forget what the score was  --  but we beat ' em anyhow . My nose was hurting a little after the game and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , a piece of bone that seemed like the size of a walrus tusk comes plunking out and my nose just caved in on one side and it 's been like this ever since . There was n't any way you could put that bone back up in there . And I never got hurt a lick playing football . " // Bobby was never much of a student at Tennessee . He never did graduate , a fact he regrets to this day . Consequently , Dodd has a near obsession about the importance of a diploma and he insists that his players complete their studies and graduate . Because of this he keeps his athletes on scholarship long after their athletic eligibility has expired . For it often takes five years for a boy to receive a diploma at the tough engineering school . // Asked if he had any special plans for the game with Auburn on Saturday , Dodd grinned impishly and replied : // " Oh , maybe we 'll brush up on the Kingsport pass play a bit . It works pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and scored four times . The quarterback fakes , hides the ball , then throws to one of his ends . You never saw men so free as our ends were against Auburn . I call it the Kingsport play because I picked it up from my old high school coach Ed Sprankle at Kingsport . I guess we must have scored 40 touchdowns with it at Tech . " // JORDAN LEARNED // Across the state border in Auburn , Alabama , a couple of days later , Coach Ralph ( Shug ) Jordan of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute , gritted his teeth when reminded of how Tech fooled him with the Kingsport pass . " That damn old wobbly little pass liked to killed us that day , " he recalled . " But I learned my lesson . " // Auburn 's offense is relatively simple . Jordan drills five or six plays to perfection , and this is his attack . Against Tennessee , he used only five plays , but the execution was magnificent . // Dodd , on the other hand , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unbalanced lines , split ends and flankers. // The game , a sellout since last summer , is one of the most torrid rivalries in the South and brings together two of the most rabid sets of alumni anywhere . Friendly brawls are commonplace in the stands . Strangely enough , the aftermath of the game is apt to be peaceful only if Auburn loses . Dodd explains it this way : // " Those Auburn people , they 're fine losers . Do n't come any better . But when they win , watch out . They want to tear the place apart . "
