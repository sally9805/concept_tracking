txt Gen. Eisenhower turned back to World War II in his speech here tonight to explain to the people of Detroit and the nation why he did not take Berlin . Speaking extemporaneously and without notes to guide him as he faced the batteries of radio microphones and TV cameras , Eisenhower put forward two reasons why allied forces sat back and watched the Russians march into Hitler 's capital . One reason , he asserted , was that the Russians had to be kept out of Denmark , and he inferred that this was a more important task for western armies . The second reason was that the capture of Berlin cost the Russians 10,000 men , and would have cost us the same . Hits " Brave Men " of 1952 " None of these brave men of 1952 who criticize us now for not taking Berlin would have been willing to choose the 10,000 American mothers whose sons would have been sacrificed in capturing this city , ' Eisenhower said . He asked his audience : " What was the big point in attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already told us that the line we must occupy was 200 miles to the west ? " The general disclosed that at the Potsdam conference , which he attended , he made two recommendations , both of which were disregarded . First , he recommended that Germany not be divided into parts , and second , he asserted that he opposed inviting Russia into the Japanese war . Stadium Seats Empty Tonight 's address in Olympia s-f-a.dium , in which thousands of seats were empty despite the fact that the speech had been advertised for days , was the general 's first attempt at extemporaneous , " off the cuff " oratory .

" Makes Snap Decision When his aids protested that it was too late to draft a new text , he made the snap decision to talk off the cuff . He announced that intention today at a civic breakfast . " All my prepared talks are thrown out the window , " he said at the breakfast . " I am not a medicine man and I have no panaceas for anything . All I can do , therefore , is to show how I would approach these problems . If what I have got to offer in the way of an honest , decent approach as I see it for Americans to this problem is not enough , t here is nothing more I can do . " Some observers believe the general , chagrined at the poor reception of the painstakingly prepared Abilene speech , made an eleventh hour decision to stake all or nothing on this new oratorical gambit . Opinions differed tonight as to whether the gamble was worth tho risk , Denies Political Debts Tonight 's address resembled that of Abilene in being of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without digging deeply into any one of the problems he mentioned .

He said he has no political debts , altho a delegate from his mother 's state had brought him a fine ham . He said , if nominated , he will make a fighting campaign because it has been his business for 40 years to learn the trade of fighting . Eisenhower said he is strictly a " no deal " man , and that corruption can be cleaned out of the government " without besmirching the reputation of any man . " Women Curious About Berlin In the section of his address devoted to the last war , Eisenhower admitted he often has been asked why he did not take Berlin , and that the question strangely enough often comes from women . At the time the final invasion plan for Germany was completed , he said , allied forces were 300 miles from Berlin and the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line , thinking that the Russians should be there long before we were , " he said .

" When we could have marched on , there were other jobs to accomplish . One of them was to keep the Russians out of Denmark by pushing our left , which we did . " The address climaxed a furious day in which Gen. and Mrs. Eisenhower had no more than a few minutes to themselves from the moment they stepped from their private railroad car this morning into blistering hot Detroit weather . Crowd Estimates Differ There was a parade , with streets lined with " Welcome , Ike " banners . The parade ended with a quick Flag day address by Eisenhower before the city ball in Cadillac square to a crowd estimated officially by the Detroit police traffic director at 80,000 persons , but pared to 60,000 by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid $10 each to attend .

Summerfield , Republican national committeeman , emerged from the closed session smiling and noncommittal . " This fine delegation of ours is all friendly  --  to one another , " he said . Tomorrow morning , in time sandwiched in between a press conference and his take off for Denver , Eisenhower will talk to delegates from Indiana and Ohio who have come to give him the once over .
