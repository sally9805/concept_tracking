Altoona is a Saturday-night town . You can take in a movie on Monday night ? choice of six . On Tuesday you can bowl . On Wednesday you can windowshop along 11th Avenue or shoot a little pool . Thursday is the night for bingo , with prizes as high as $300 , cash ; and Friday nobody wants to miss the song fest at the Mayfair Lounge . On any old night in Altoona you can drop a quarter into a slot machine , eat a pizza pie , or watch TV ; and on any night but Sunday , when the blue laws close the bars , you can get a drink . But Saturday night is the night when the big bands blare at the Oriental , and the small bands play for dancing in the German clubs on Dutch Hill , and the Poles and the Irish and the Italians slide their glasses across the mahogany for more . and everyone can stay out late because tomorrow is Sunday . Altoona is a railroad town . Its spine is a wide maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train whistles blow above the other noises of the street , and when you look at the sky there are puffs of smoke bursting above the locomotives as the trains with the magic names speed through to the Horseshoe Curve . Even the best room in the best hotel has a film of grime over the bathtub , and housewives who live in houses near the tracks wash their parlor curtains and scrub their front porches twice a week . Let me tell you about Altoona , Pa . It 's the home town of Janet Blair and two millionaires . In its population of almost 80,000 there are also a onelegged bartender , a waitress who dresses like Eddie Arcaro , and a handful of gangsters who skim through the gritty streets in cream-white Cadillac convertibles as if they were movie stars in Beverly Hills . Otherwise it is a city of workers who make railroad cars and radiators and detonators and Butterick patterns and do n't expect to become rich but have fun on Saturday night . They never see a ballet or an opera . They have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tennis matches . But authors and world travelers come to lecture now and then . the AItoona Senior High has a fine a cappella choir , and the wrestling matches at the Jaffa Mosque on the last Saturday night of the month feature the most renowned of the grunters , from Argentine Rocco to Gorgeous George . Once a year an ice show hits town . and once every few years , the circus . But any night in the week there are plenty of places to go . They never pull in the sidewalks in Altoona . My tour of the town 's life after dark began in the Mayfair Lounge of the Penn Alto Hotel , with S. Carlton Ayres of the local radio station as my guide . As its name would indicate , the Mayfair Lounge is Altoona 's answer to Chicago 's Pump Room . or New York 's Persian Room . or whatever any city might have in the way of cafe swank . It is a big , rectangular , high-ceilinged room , with the decorator 's touch everywhere , from the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall brackets of white plaster . Most of its space is taken up by a bar at which ladies are forbidden to sit , a rule aimed at discouraging pickups . Altoona hotels are full of traveling men , alone and presumably lonesome and possibly bored after a day of negotiating in knit goods or roller bearings , and it is the management 's fear that these tired chaps would be easy prey for any female in red silk stockings and green perfume sliding up onto an adjacent bar stool . So each side of the bar has its discreet little sign reading " Service at the Bar for Men Only . " And there they sit and stand , male next to male next to male , most of them not talking except for a word or two to the bartender , most of them just staring into their glasses and drinking their 60c bonded ryes or their 55c Manhattans . Mr. Ayres and I watched them from our coeducational table for two , made plans to return for the song fest , and went on to dinner at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is the place most people in Altoona consider Altoona 's top restaurant . Its menu is as elaborate as the menu at Lindy 's in New York , and the very best people in Altoona frequently have to wait for tables . It is a low , pinkish , pseudo-Spanish building with neon signs hung on the front that proclaim " Spaghetti , " " Beer , " " Liquor " ; and inside it is composed of the four rooms that came into being as the Panasetti brothers ? Jim , Joe , and Tony ? prospered . We ate in the Villa 's pink-and-yellow main dining room . A trio of musicians , equipped with a maple-colored bass fiddle , a piano , and a drum that glittered like solid rhinestones , played " Everything I Have Is Yours " in slow tempo . Waitresses in black-and-white dresses served the customers with speedy informality , seeming to know everybody quite well ? the newspaper owner , the sportscaster , the doctor . The waitresses bustled around with spaghetti ( 85 ? , including meat balls ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time Our Doors Are Open , " it said on the menu ) ; and the seven-course dinner with hot turkey sandwich , gravy . and cranberry sauce ( $1.50 ) . They carried trays piled with veal scallopine , sherried sweet potatoes , buttered rutabagas , baked acorn squash , and broiled New York club steak ; and they bore thick china dishes in which reposed three fried oysters with chicken salad , ladyfingers with cherry Bavarian cream , and roast fresh ham with filling . A LTOONA likes things fried in deep fat Week in and week out the most popular specialty at the Villa is the shore platter , which has to be seen to be believed and eaten to be appreciated . It is served on a big oval dish with lettuce and radishes and other garniture . It consists of half a broiled Maine lobster , a mound of tuna-fish salad , French fried potatoes , cole-slaw , fried oysters , fried shrimp ; fried scallops , fried fillets , and a fried crab-cake . Everything that is fried is fried in as authentic a crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get all this for $1.75 , and anyone who can polish off the whole platter belongs in an eating contest . At nine o'clock the electric lights in the room are turned off and the waitresses go around putting candles , shielded by glass cylinders , on all the tables . The crowd has thinned out some by then ? they dine early in Altoona ? and the young people filtering in for drinks or sandwiches can dance in the space cleared in front of the bandstand , in the flickering romantic light . Ten per cent of the customers at the Villa order red wine with their meals , little Jimmy . Panasetti estimates ; but none of them , not even the many of Italian extraction , call for espresso . In Altoona they like their food heavy and their coffee weak . Because members of New York 's nightowl society have come to regard the method by which a man makes a Martini as an infallible barometer of his sophistication ( an excess of vermouth is as serious a faux pas as a loud belch ) , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave it to me ? 1i parts gin to 3/4 parts vermouth , with an olive ? and he looked surprised when I looked surprised . Actually that was a mere bagatelle . By four in the morning I had found a place where the formula was one to one . To a great extent the social pattern of Altoona is based on its industrial history . Altoona grew with the railroads . It had the first roundhouse in America , and it still has the biggest . It is the No. 1 city in the nation for railroad equipment and locomotive repairs . German precision mechanics came from the old country to Altoona to work on the big trains . They remained and settled , and their grandsons and greatgrandsons are still the miraculous mechanics of the town . The Italians and Irish , both called " Mickeys " when the railroads were young , came to Blair County to lay the tracks , and so did the Poles . When the need for that work lessened , the Irish went into the blacksmith shops and the Poles became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no language or social barrier , all these workingmen seem to feel more comfortable with their own kind during their evening hours . So they herd together in clubs ? Polish clubs , Italian clubs , railroad men 's clubs , veterans ' societies . In almost every instance these organizations are based on nationality groupings . But in some cases , as time has gone on , new members of other national origins have been taken in , and now only the club 's name gives a clue to the nationality of those who founded it . An example of this development was our next stop ? the Heidelberg , on the Frankstown Road that leads from Altoona to Pittsburgh . Originally this was a German club ; now it has members of many nationalities . Outside , if it were not for the big sign , it would look like a pleasant white farmhouse ; but inside there is a bar with red stools , a bandstand , and a dance floor paved with marbleized black-andwhite linoleum . An orchestra plays here only on Saturday and Sunday nights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffleboard in the cellar game room or absorb soft drinks and watch TV . It costs $25 to join the club , $36 a year in dues . Men are the members ; their wives come as guests . An opposite number to the Heidelberg is the Buccinese , an attractively decorated Italian club in the heart of town that requires its regular members to be Italian ? and not merely Italian , but either sons of persons from Buccino , Italy , or married to daughters of Buccinese . " Social " members simply pay a dollar to join , but they are apt to be Italian too . ONE of Altoona 's favorite places for young professional people is the bar of the tiny Boulevard Hotel , where we made our next stop . Located at the breezy corner of Plank Road and Logan Boulevard , it has been in turn a grocery store , a barbershop , and a state-police barracks , but now it is a fine place for a glass and a chat , dim enough to be restful , bright enough to see what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a British neighborhood pub , where every newcomer who steps over the threshold seems to know someone already seated at a table , and the time of evening is  | passed cheerfully by those en route to the bar . The Boulevard has booths , comfortably padded in tan leather , and tables with light Formica tops , and the inevitable television set . But above all it has Gracie , the most popular waitress in Altoona . Gracie is plump and graying , and she twinkles behind gold-and-tortoise-shell glasses . She wears starched white , which makes her look reassuringly like a trained nurse , and she loves to hear stories and to tell them . " Let 's go over to the Boulevard and see Gracie " is the way many a long evening in Altoona starts . Gracie 's ears are the repository for some of the town 's best-kept secrets and heaviest troubles . Her full name is Grace Yingling . She is married to a fellow named George , whom everybody calls Sam ( nobody knows why , not even Gracie ) , and her optimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he grew out of the bar said in summation , " You can feel blue and low , but you listen to Gracie for a few minutes and suddenly you 're laughing . " THE song fest at the Mayfair Lounge was in full swing by the time we got there . At the far end of the room an uninhibited plump blonde with bare shoulders and a carrying voice sat on a high platform at a Hammond organ , singing and calling out to the aficionados and getting everybody to join her in " Shine On , Harvest Moon . " She was Ruth Gillmore , star attraction at the Penn Alto ? sweet-faced , rather like a chubby version of Una Merkel , and the perfect type to lead a community sing . She wore a white net dress , strapless , with emeraldgreen sequins sprayed on the bodice : and her feet , in silver sandals , danced across the pedals of the organ as she pounded out the tunes . " Come on now ? everybody ! " she commanded . And they obeyed . Haltingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all singing " I Want to Be in Loveland " and " Never Take a Girl Named Mary . " They knew the lyrics to all the old ones . At intervals she did a solo . One was a ribald little number called " I Ai n't Gon na Take It Settin ' Down " ; and when the customers chortled and applauded and demanded more verses , Ruth shook her finger at them waggishly . " Oh , you lovers of the finer things , " she shrieked . " I like you ! " A handsome fat little boy in a basque shirt sat solemnly at the edge of the organ platform , looking up at Ruth and mouthing the words to all the songs but not really making any sound . He was her nine-year-old son . As the crowd warmed up , soloists took courage . Sammy Albright , Janet Blair 's cousin , who is in the produce business , climbed onto the platform and sang " Because , " simply and quite movingly . Samuel Cohn , one of Altoona 's two millionaires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Side . " ( Sam , an independent oilman , is a song-fest enthusiast who often goes to New York and works up singing groups at Bill 's Gay Nineties . ) There was a call from some of the tables for " Marty , " and Martha Roberts , a vocal teacher with copper-red hair who once sang on the radio from New York , lifted her highly trained soprano in " One Alone . " Then everybody joined in " Some of These Days . "  | Just before closing time " Cupcake Bill " Heller , president of the Heller-Eagle Bakery , made a vivacious entrance and was thumped on the back by the men and greeted by the ladies with little shrieks of " Here 's Cupcake ! " and anticipatory giggles of delight . Everybody in Altoona knows Bill is going to turn up toward the end of the song fest and treat everybody to coffee and Heller-Eagle cupcakes , and he never disappoints them . As we left , the refreshments were being served , and people were singing " The Daughter of Rosie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the William Penn Hotel . The long narrow lounge there is almost always crowded with traveling salesmen , inevitably a few in such high spirits that Irene Mathew , the miniature waitress who dresses like a jockey , has become an expert at broken-field running while balancing a highball on a tray . Irene is bright-eyed , tireless , flip when the occasion demands . Her costume ? brown jodhpurs , a pink shirt , pink cap , and saddle shoes ? is a conversation piece . Sid Holzman , the manager of the hotel , had the idea of getting her to dress that way ; he thought it would spark the lounge . So Irene went to the sports department of Gable 's department store and assembled the outfit . It was an instant hit ; now when she puts on an ordinary uniform for a change , the regulars twit her and pretend to complain . This is a sign of affection , a sign that Altoona would not be the same without Irene . O N THE main street , one steep flight up , past a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is the clubroom of the United Veterans Association , to which we repaired as the hours grew small . It is strictly a late spot . The crowd starts wandering in at one , and the space around the bar really fills up by two . Three is the shank of the evening . War veterans and railroad workers are the only ones eligible to belong to the club , and it is a favorite place for them because they are comfortable there among others in work clothes . This is a bar where a man can stand and drink with his cap on . The UVA is open from 7 A.M. Sunday until 3 A.M. Monday , and for a reason that makes sense in Altoona . Railroad workers get into the habit of rising at five . When retirement comes , the years of habit overwhelm the new leisure , and they rise before dawn even though there is no alarm clock or wife 's voice calling from the kitchen . So on Sunday morning they get up and put on neat Sunday clothes and go down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swapping stories about how it was on the tracks in the old days . They sit there , warm and clean , and mingle with the younger men just getting through work , tired in their work clothes , masked with grime , needing the whisky before they go home to sleep . There is a mad , elaborate juke box in the room , crazily colored with lights and rainbow glass , as if a giant had picked up Times Square and crushed it into a little cabinet ; and there is the big comfortable bar and plain tables and chairs , where such as George W. McNally , known as Mike , can sit with his glass , resting his paunch and enjoying the warmth and noise of other men . Mike is big of stomach and jolly , a former minor-league umpire and onetime bartender . It is a sight to see him come into the club , hang his red-lined jacket and umpire 's cap on a coathook and emerge before the company in his low-slung gold-colored cardigan and faded blue pants . Of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doodlebug , " the bartender at the UVA . Hardly anybody in town can come up with the information that his real name is Clifford Longnecker ; he has been called " Doodlefor so long that any other name would probably get no response from him . He is a thin , balding little fellow with a skinny neck and inconspicuous glasses . the portrait of an anonymous little gray man . But he is the town talker and a spinner of yarns , and the regulars , like Mike McNally , have figured out that if Doodle has done all the things he claims to have done , and worked and traveled in all the places he mentions , he is 279 years old . He has been a boxer , and a baseball player , and a drummer in jazz bands On certain nights he gets at the set of drums the club keeps in the back and whales the daylights out of them to prove one of his stories . At around four in the morning I lean across the bar while he was pour ' drinks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted Weems , " he said , " was one . " " Did you play with the band when Perry Como was singing with it ? " I asked . " Yeah , " said Doodle . " I know Perry . ' " He added in a tone that was just a shady condescending , " He 's a nice young fellow . " Doodle also said he had played the drums at the Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles when Harry Richman was starring there . Harry was a nice fellow too I asked him whether he played the drums in Gene Krupa 's style or more like Cozy Cole . He thought about it for a minute , dashed some rye from a bottle into a shot glass , and came to a decision " I 'm like both of ' em , " he said . Doodle told me , as he has been telling the railroad men for years , that he is the only drummer around Altoona who can execute a triple paradiddle . He is perfectly safe in saying it , because he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere ? who knows what a triple paradiddle is . SO YOU see how it is in Altoona . There are the men who make the locomotives , and the girl wire winders from the Sylvania tube factory , and the assemblers from the plants that make secret items for the U.S. government . Altoona has a shuttlecock factory run by a proper Englishman , and silk mills , and a shop that makes the best track shoes in America . It has Lions , who meet on Monday . and Kiwanians , who convene on Wednesday . It has parking meters and people who drink Tom Collins ' in winter and the most perfect example of Romanesque architecture in the nation . The best steak in town is served at Toffey 's restaurant by Bob Toffey , who reads meters for the gas company in the daytime . The biggest dances are held at the Oriental , where Ralph Flanagan and Guy Lombardo and Vaughn Monroe play one-night stands . Erculiani 's , at the top of Gallitzin Mountain , is the place that boasts it serves such giant portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a whole $5.50 dinner . It is  | also the place that has Uncle Angelo , an old man with one leg and one crutch but the fastest bartender for miles around and author of many a wicked cocktail . Baked ham is very big in Altoona , and a specialty at Tom and Joe 's diner near the station . For hot dogs with onions , the Texas Hot Lunch on 11th Avenue is the place to go . Everybody in town looks forward to the annual minstrel show put on by the members of the Frohsinn Singing Society during the week of Washington 's Birthday . The elite , after gala dinners , mix chartreuse with Benedictine . The poor drink beer . They all ? rich , poor , grimy , waltzing , or weary ? seem to realize that they are part of a heartbeat . The nation would limp and sag without Altoona , and that knowledge , like a flag , makes Altoona gayer on Saturday night .  |                @ @ @ @ @
