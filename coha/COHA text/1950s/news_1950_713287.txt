txt President Truman blamed James F. Byrnes for whittling down the Potsdam agreements and permitting Russia to gain dominance over Rumania , Bulgaria and Hungary , according to Jonathan Daniels in his new book , " The Man of Independence , " which will be published tomorrow . In a biography that quotes the President copiously , the editor of The Raleigh ( N. C. ) News and Observer gives many insights on men and incidents of recent history , such as : The intrigues over the Vice Presidential nomination in 1944 , General of the Army George C. Marshall 's mission to China , Chief Justice Fred M , Vinson 's aborted mission to Moscow and the wavering Palestine policy . On two counts , however , the ( host fascinating reading in the book concerns the relations of President Truman and Mr. Byrnes . It is the story of a friendship that soured badly . " Byrnes lost his nerve in Moscow , " Mr. Truman is quoted as saying of his then Secretary of State after the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers in 1945 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed miserably " as Secretary of State . Efforts to reach Mr. Byrnes by telephone at his home in Spartanburg , S. C. , Tuesday night were unsuccessful . He was quoted by The Spartanburg Herald as saying that " I have not seen the book and I do not care to make any comment . " ) At Potsdam , Mr. Truman told Stalin that he had no intention of recognizing Rumania , Bulgaria and Hungary until they had free governments . Then when Mr. Byrnes returned from Moscow in December , 1945 , the President felt he had gone too far in yielding on the satellites , and according to the book , his anger was not lessened by Mr. Byrnes ' announcement of the new policy before Mr. Truman was informed of it . " Byrnes got the real riot act after Moscow , " Mr. Daniels quotes the President as having said . " I told him our policy was not appeasement and not a one-way street . " The final break between the President and Secretary of State came in January , 1947 . Mr : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other person who has been associated with him in high office . He has expressed his bitterness with these words from the book : " He failed miserably as Secretary of State , and ran out on me when the going was very rough and when I needed him worst . His ' bad heart ' has now left him when be has found that he made a bad guess . So he and Old Baruch have joined the McCormicks , Hearsts and Scripps-Howards to discredit me . They will not succeed . " Truman for Byrnes in ' 44 It was not always that way as Mr. Daniels tells it : Back in 1944 when the big politicians were making and breaking political careers , Mr. Truman sent word that Mr. Roosevelt could go to hell . That is the way he turned down the first proffer of the vice presidential nomination , for he had pledged to support the candidacy of Mr. Byrnes . He stuck by Mr. Byrnes until the latter withdrew from the race " in deference " to President Roosevelt . The big bosses . did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt 's first choice , but was persuaded to drop him by those who felt a former Catholic would be a liability . While Mr. Daniels denies the book is an " authorized biography , " It is apparent that Mr. Truman made it easy for the author to consult primary sources , including himself . Often the editor from Raleigh could be seen around the executive offices with his manuscript showing . Some of the material has come out of the diary that Mr. Daniels kept while he was on the staff of Presidents Roosevelt and Truman . He quotes Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy , who was dubious of General Marshall as a diplomat . The admiral said that General Marshall told him he was going to China to tell Chiang Kai-shek " that he had to get on with the Communists or without help from us . " Palestine Policy Shifts Told Shifts in Palestine policy that . preceded the establishment of the State of Israel are presented in a I , clearer light by the book . Mr. Dan-1 iels puts the onus for the calling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension of the partition plan , for instance , was proposed on March 19 , 194S , at a time when the then Secretary of State Marshall was in California and his Under-Secretary , Robert A. Lovett , was in Florida . According to . Mr. Daniels , the President was steadfast in his resolve to see Israel established and implied that he was imposed upon by those who were manipulating the policy in the State Department . He even cites Chaim Weizmann . President of Israel . who was then a close witness in Washington , as having full faith in Mr. Truman but believing that he did not know " on Thursday what was going to happen on Friday . " The book tells of the incident at a White House conference on the issue . Clark M. Clifford , then the President 's special counsel , argued for immediate recognition of Israel , and General Marshall said sharply that this was no matter to he decided on a political basis . and Mr. Clifford would not be there but for political considerations . So for the moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put off . But later that same day . Mr. Lovett , who had been asked by Secretary Marshall to state the case against recognition , called to tell Mr. Clifford of his uneasiness about the decision . He said that the issue would be re-studied , and late the next day , Mr. Truman proclaimed recognition . Considerable research by Mr. Daniels in Missouri has uncovered some new material of Mr. Truman 's pre-Presidential days . They fill out the story of a man who was unsure of the course he wished to follow until he was in his thirties . For a time he was postmaster of Grandview , and he was one of the owners of a building and loan association . He got into the nil well development business with a man who went on to riches , but Harry Truman , the National Guardsman , had to pull out to go to war , He broke about even on his investment , and became the captain of Battery D , 129th Field Artillery . In his soldiering and the comradeship that grew out of it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A soldier nephew of Torn Pendergast , Kansas City political boss , took notice of him , liked him , and recommended him to his uncle for the county judgeship in which Mr. Truman made a lustrous record as an honest and efficient road-builder and administrator . Mr. Truman insisted on honesty , and his righteous behavior tickled Boss Pendergast . Mr. Daniels relates the story of a meeting attended by some road builders who had not given the county its money 's worth in former contracts . They were complaining that Mr. Truman would not give them any more contracts . Mr. Truman told them that they could get them if they were low bidders  --  but they would not be paid unless they met specifications . The way Pendergast ended the meeting was : " Did n't I tell you boys ? He 's the contrariest cuss in Missouri ! " Ms. Daniels reports a curious ' comparison that Mr. Truman made , likening Pendergast to Stalin , and the Eightieth Congress , which he had called the worst in our history , to the Politburo . " Stalin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know " ; and , " I got the impression , " Truman said later , " that Stalin would stand by his agreements , and also that he had a Politburo on his hands like the Eightieth Congress . " Mr. Truman has drastically revised his opinion of Stalin , but he has remained faithful to the memory of Pendergast . Eventually the boss went to jail for income tax frauds , but to Mr. Truman he was the man who gave him his political opportunities without , ever demanding anything dishonest of him . " If he had died there in New York , " Truman said , " he would be remembered as the greatest boss this country ever had . " There was a moment , according to Mr. Daniels , when Mr. Truman , like other politicians seeking votes , flirted with the Ku Klux Klan . A political helper suggested membership during Mr. Truman 's second campaign for county judge . He put up $10 as an entrance fee ; but took it back when he was told he would have to deny jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic battery in the war an if any of those boys needed job he would help them . That year th , Klan worked against him , an Harry Truman for the first an only time in his political caree was defeated in an election .
