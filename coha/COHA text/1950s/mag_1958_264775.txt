FOREIGN RELATIONS Faith Under Fire <P> At the weekly White House conference with G.O.P. Senate leaders one morning last week , Senate G.O.P. Policy Committee Chairman Styles Bridges asked permission to read a letter from an irate citizen . The letter , delivered with oratorical flourishes , was a scathing indictment of the U.S. exhibit at the Brussels Fair as a notable U.S. propaganda failure in the cold war . Leaving the White House , Bridges told reporters that the President was " very irritated " at what he had heard . And next day , on the President 's urgent order , purse-lipped George V. Allen , head of the U.S. Information Agency and as such , keeper of the world 's mental image of the U.S. , hopped a plane for Brussels for an official inspection of the major U.S. exhibit . <P> Down with Abstractions . Cause of the excitement , it turned out later , was Chicago-born Hayes Robertson , 53 , onetime Census Bureau clerk and now a lawyer in Chicago Heights , Ill. , where he also is board chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and Mrs. Robertson took in the fair as the high spot of a European tour . " Everybody I talked to was interested in seeing the two largest exhibits , the Russian and ours , " said Robertson . " But as I walked through the American exhibit , I did n't see America anywhere . " What Robertson saw and did not like broke down as : Too much modern art . An admitted fan of Norman Rockwell 's Satevepost covers , Robertson did a slow burn at acres of abstract art and blowtorch sculpture which looked , he said , as if it had been put together by a " bunch of neurotics . " " When I walked out , my mind was a complete blank . " <P> A collection of U.S. memorabilia intended to tell a social history of the U.S. , ranging from a cigar-store wooden Indian to an early-model Ford , a chipped plaster statue of Washington and a glass showcase of latter-day examples of Western tumbleweeds . Some of the signs , said Robertson , were embarrassingly inept . Example : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three languages as the model of chairs used in " virtually all " U.S. schools today . " A group I saw , " said Robertson , " read the card and burst into laughter . " <P> Claims about the American standard of living " so unreal as to cause an observer to dismiss the entire exhibit as false propaganda . " For example : a television program showing " a woman coming from the supermarket with a bag of groceries , getting into her private plane and returning by air to her suburban home . " <P> Utterly absent from the exhibit , said Robertson , was any suggestion of " our industrial achievements , " any real feeling for how Americans live , any hint of " how we tax ourselves to help the other people of the world .
