Four years ago , TV Playwright Rod Serling made his reputation with Patterns , a cliche-ridden but highly effective drama about a ruthless power struggle inside Big Business . Last week , as if to even things up , Playwright Serling took on Big Labor . The Rank and File ( on CBS 's Playhouse 99 ) sprawled across two decades of picket lines and meeting halls , was less neatly patterned than Patterns , with its close-order action around the directors ' table . But , because exectuive suites have become a show-business commonplace , while the union local is still relatively fresh territory , The Rank and File carried far greater interest . <P> Serling 's hero-turned-villain is Bill Kilcoyne ( played to the hilt by Old Pro Van Heflin ) , a rough-hewn factory worker whom circumstance elects as first president of his local . An idealist to begin with , he sells out for a mess of spoilage ( a union vice-presidency ) by making a deal with a union thug named Tony Russo . Before long , Kilcoyne lands in the deadly end-justifies-the-means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union funds into such investments as race tracks and silk ties . By the time a Senate committee gets at him , he is powerful , self-assured , and cockily forgetful of his past actions . <P> Although Author Serling has denied that he modeled his hero on Teamster <P> Boss Jimmy Hoffa , Director Frank Schaffner left little doubt about whom he had in mind . Among other coincidences , the chairman of the Senate committee is gruff and dry-throated ( Arkansas ' Senator McClellan ) , the Senate 's counsel boyish and shock-haired ( Robert Kennedy ) . The Rank and File had more than its share of walking , talking cliches , was clearly less concerned with presenting moving characters than with characterizing a movement . But if nothing else , it succeeded in dramatizing the breathtaking reversal of political fortunes that transformed , in one generation , yesterday 's picket-line victims into today 's labor masters . <P> The Rank and File marked another reversal : Playwright Serling 's departure from live TV drama . At 34 the author of more than 100 TV plays , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious playwright 's place in TV . But disillusioned Writer Serling announced last week that next season his world belongs to the series , has signed on to write a weekly half-hour science-fiction show called The Twilight Zone .
