With the decline of such established feuding centers as Corsica , Sicily and Harlan County , Ky. , the killingest people on earth today may well be the citizens of Ilocos Sur province ( pop . 275,000 ) in northern Luzon . There , long before dusk , nervous wives set out the evening meal and draw the shutters , for , as the local saying goes , when the sun sets , blood begins to flow . Last year 87 murders were recorded in the province , and no one knew how many others went unreported by Ilocanos who did not want to get involved as witnesses . In Ilocos Sur 's capital of Vigan ( pop . 24,000 ) , where 70 have been murdered in the past two years , there are 214 back murder cases on the docket , some dating to 1951 . <P> Ilocanos seem to need little excuse to kill . A month ago two men burst into the home of Florentino Lazo at Manzante village , blasted Lazo and his son Jos with carbines as they sat at dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with Mariano and Isabelo Tayaba-who , in turn , were thought to have killed Lauriano and Pablo Sadabo . Besides , young Jos was scheduled to testify soon at still another murder trial . Police had all the motives they could want , and jailed two suspects . <P> In Puro Pinget , a stone 's throw away , a dozen murders have taken place in the past year over a faction fight that has split the northern and southern sections of the village into warring groups . Puro Pinget 's new village boss , elected fortnight ago by unanimous vote , is 37-year-old David Torda , currently out on bail on a charge of killing a 72-year-old neighbor in June . <P> Much of the bloodshed in the province can really be traced to the political quarrels of two old rivals for the Ilocos congressional seat in Manila . One is the Liberal Party 's Floro Crisologo , who served three terms , then lost to his enemy , Nacionalista Congressman Faustino Tobia . " Sure , I give my boys guns , " admits Tobia ( whose uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect themselves , do n't they ? " Crisologo is equally frank : " I do n't deny it . We kill Tobia 's men . But we kill only one to every four or five of our own killed by his goons . We should get medals . " <P> <P> So far this year , Ilocos Sur 's murder roster totals 61 , but the season is barely under way : in Ilocos Sur , as in the rest of the Philippines , elections will be held in November to choose new mayors , a new provincial governor and eight new Senators to send to Manila , and this always makes for unrest . As frightened priests ( who celebrate separate Masses in Ilocos , one for each faction ) called for peace and quiet , the Philippine government dispatched a battalion of 1,100 troops to the troubled province , and three more judges were rushed up to Vigan to help handle the overcrowded dockets . Sighed Defense Secretary Alejo Santos , making an on-the-scene inspection : " These people have created a new industry for themselves : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
