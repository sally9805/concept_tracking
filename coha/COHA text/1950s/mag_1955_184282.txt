They overran the orchards and devoured the crops . The Emperor , rueful of his error , ordered the sparrows back . <P> It is now ten years since the Allies drove the Japanese back to the cage of their meager islands and forbade them ever to bear arms again .

For most of his adult life , Ichiro Hatoyama has longed to govern Japan . In fact , even before he was born , his politician father intended him to be a politician , and his mother , a woman of learning and vigor who believed that a child in the womb is shaped by the mother 's thoughts , carefully limited her pregnancy reading to biographies of great men and politicians .
