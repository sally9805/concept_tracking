It looked like a holiday . In their Sabbath best , 57,000 ladies ' dressmakers poured from their cubicle workrooms one day last week and onto the pavement of twelve mid-Manhattan blocks along and around Seventh Avenue , the throbbing heart of the New York City garment trade that produces 72% of all U.S. dresses . Babbling happily in the accents of Poland , Puerto Rico , Italy and Brooklyn , they marched half a mile up Eighth <P> Avenue to Madison Square Garden . There , cherubic Union Boss Dave Dubinsky , his arms windmilling from atop a prizefight ring , officially proclaimed the garment industry 's first general strike since 1933 . <P> This strike bore no resemblance to earlier ones . Gone were the days , from 1909 to 1933 , when dress workers staged ten of the bloodiest strikes in New York history to organize the industry . In the late 19203 and early 1930s strikers and shop owners had fought in the streets with shivs and sawed-off pool cues . Knife-wielding Communists ripped and clubbed workers in a vain attempt to run them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dubinsky moved up to the presidency of the parent garment union , the International Ladies ' Garment Workers , forced out the Communists , rallied the divided unionists , won concessions from management and steered labor into calm waters . <P> Ghettos to Gin Rummy . Last week 's peaceful strike tied up the industry from Massachusetts to Delaware . In all , 105,000 workers walked out of 2,286 shops . Retailers howled . Although most shops have 80% or 85% of their Easter clothes in stock , many were caught short of supply , and no one will be able to reorder if a popular line sells out . <P> Dave Dubinsky 's powerful ( 455,000 members , $225 million in shrewdly invested assets ) I.L.G.W.U. wanted 315% boost in dressmakers ' wages ( Manhattan average : $2.10 an hour ) . It would be the first hike since 1953 . Manufacturers , crying recession , offered 5% . <P> The biggest reason for the strike went much deeper than wages and was much harder to settle . It was , as one weary I.L.G.W.U. official said , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The top rulers in the union and management are old cronies . Together , they had streamed from the Eastern European ghettos to the garment district sweatshops 40 years ago ; together , they still play gin rummy by summer and bake on the Miami beaches on vacations in winter . And together they fixed the wage scales . When a maker brought out a new dress , a joint management-union conclave decided what share of the wholesale price would go to the union 's pieceworkers for cutting and sewing it .
