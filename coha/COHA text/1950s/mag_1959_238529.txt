Haiti 's President Fracois Duvalier is a man with many real troubles . He is beset at home by an opposition that plots and throws bombs constantly ; he is beset east and west by the Dominican Republic and Cuba , which keep trying to strike at each other through Haiti . But he has one powerful friend , the U.S. , which sent him 50 marines to train his army and has had destroyers around the Windward Passage to discourage seaborne invasion . Last week one of Duvalier 's tactical companies crept up on the 30-man invasion force that slipped in from Cuba a fortnight ago ( TIME . Aug. 17 ) . In a flurry of gunfire , the troops killed most of the invaders , captured four , sent the rest fleeing wildly . <P> At this point , just when he should have relaxed , the sick ( cardiac disease ) , suspicious President picked a new fight with a more serious opponent : the Roman Catholic Church . On Duvalier 's orders , his tough cops grabbed up Father Etienne Grienenberger. rector of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Joseph Marrec , a small-town pastor , and hustled them roughly onto a New York-bound plane , expelling them from Haiti for " reasons of internal security . " <P> Duvalier had long harbored a resentment against the church , considering it a bastion of the opposition . Most of the priests are white , French-born and close to the mulatto upper classes that strongly oppose Duvalier , a Catholic himself but with close political links to the voodoo priesthood . When 1,000 priests , nuns and churchgoers gathered in Port-au-Prince 's Notre Dame Cathedral to protest the expulsion order , Clement Barbot , the President 's cold-eyed secretary and secret police chief , led a gang of bullyboys into the cathedral on a wild , baton-swinging charge , arrested 60 . <P> For Archbishop Fracois Poirier , Haiti 's highest prelate , who is also French-born and white , this was too much . He notified parish priests up and down the island of the expulsions , followed with a denunciation of the government 's action . Duvalier retaliated with a warrant for the archbishop 's arrest for violating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothing against the interests of the republic . " <P> Duvalier had overreached himself ; as the Vatican hinted at automatic excommunication and Catholic Haiti throbbed with unrest , the President backed off . At week 's end the regime announced " the arrest is halted ' ' but blustered that " the President will not permit anyone to discredit the government . "
