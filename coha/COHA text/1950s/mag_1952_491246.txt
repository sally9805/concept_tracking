? Here are only a few of the problems that a pushing and breathless technology has forced upon us all : Who owns the air or , put more accurately , the spectrum ? How many television channels are practical in given areas ? What are the possibilities of ultra-high-frequency ? How many frequencies should be retained for exclusive Government use ? There are now 107 television stations in sixty-three cities . Because it did not have the answers to many questions , and felt that more scientific experimentation was necessary , the FCC three years ago declared a freeze on the granting of licenses for additional stations . The freeze is still in effect . If the FCC itself and its experts are n't sure of the answers , the motion-picture industry can be excused its own confusion . It finds itself in a position similar to that of Franklin P. Adams a few years ago on an " Information Please " program . The dour and witty F.P.A. flubbed badly on a question about the scientific facts of radio  --  an avenue of communications which paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Clifton Fadiman , master of ceremonies , reprovingly , " do n't you understand the principle of radio ? " " Mr. Fadiman , " said Adams humbly , " I do n't yet understand the principle of the telephone . " But if an Adams-minded Hollywood can only guess at where television is going , it has a pretty thorough and disturbing picture of how far television has come . In 1946 there were approximately 11,100 TV sets in use in the United States . The 1950 United States Census reported that as of April of that year " about 5,100,000 dwelling units " had TV sets . Today there are 14,000,000 sets installed and working . A year and a half ago three fourths of the sets were in the northeastern and north-central sections of the country . Since then the field of listening and looking has spread . The territory within a forty or fifty mile radius of New York City is the most thickly populated with TV sets . It is estimated that one in every two homes flies the unmistakable aerial landmark . The Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the television surveys ? a " saturated area . " Some 900,000 seta are in use there . No one in his right mind questions that theater admissions in the nation have taken a substantial nose-dive . In the territory served by Los Angeles ' film exchanges 126 motion-picture theaters closed their doors last year . There are other documented lists of closings  --  seventy in Eastern Pennsylvania , sixty-one in Massachusetts , sixty-four in the Chicago area and at least seventy-five in metropolitan New York . Some of these , to be sure , may have been seasonal closings . How much of a nose-dive has theater attendance taken ? In a highly competitive industry complicated by personal rivalries at the top , it is , perhaps , logical to expect secrecy . At any rate secrecy exists . Not even the Motion Picture Association of America , which represents the major studios , has been able over the years to pry company figures loose . One reason , of course , is the peculiar economics of the business . But another is that the tough traders at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to examine their books . What 's Happening at the Box Office ? QUCH secrecy has disappeared in most industries . 1,3 Denied access to company figures , the inquiring reporter can turn only to Federal theater-tax admissions as reported by the Bureau of Internal Revenue for light on the current situation . The movie theaters pay the lion 's share of these taxes , but included in the totals are legitimate theaters , baseball , football and circuses . Despite pyramiding box-office prices and increasing national income , Federal tax payments declined from $385,844,000 in 1949 to $345,492,000 in 1951 . And this , too , despite a 15 per cent increase in national population between 1940 and 1950 , and the greatest national income of all time . Current estimates of box-office recession vary from 20 to 40 per cent . This is a marked decline , to be sure , but to an outside observer the situation would not seem to be one of unrelieved gloom . For instance , there was at least temporary improvement in the fall of 1951 . But some owners of motion-picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their viewpoint seems to have colored the attitude of the industry as a whole . For a period of years , ignoring the drive of events , the exhibitors and many of the production people were able to pretend that television did not exist . In many studios It was a ten-letter word no gentleman ever used . The industry 's scientists rebelled early against this head-in-the-sand philosophy . As long ago as 1946 , the Society of Motion Picture Engineers  --  it is now the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers  --  urged Hollywood studios to go before the FCC and request the rights to certain television channels  --  if only as a hedge against the hazards of an unpredictable future . Loren L. Ryder , of Paramount Pictures , was then president of the society . When it developed that neither he nor any of his colleagues could get a hearing with most of the studio bosses , Ryder felt so strongly about his mission that he asked Eric Johnston , head of the Motion Picture Association , to intercede . Johnston was having his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not take up Ryder 's case . So , in Hollywood for a little longer , television was a dream . Dream 's End  --  the Rugged Awakening T HE awakening was rugged . The Department of Justice directed , as a result of a Supreme Court decision , the separation of production facilities from theater ownership . The Paramount Company , for instance , owned a studio and produced pictures in Hollywood ; it also owned many of the theaters Where the pictures were displayed . This was true of Warner Brothers , Twentieth Century-FOx and B.K.O. It was true of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . The decision of the Department of Justice that such dual ownership was a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act came as a heavy blow . Paramount was the first to divorce its studio from its theaters , and the two concerns now have operated under separate Management for more than a year . The other major Hollywood companies likewise acceded to consent decrees ; their processes of divorcement are still in progress . The separation of activities at Twentieth Century-Pox has settled down to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Skouras , his brother , president of the theater chain . These are , obediently , separate corporations . Recently I interviewed short , stocky Charles Skouras in the gun room of his Los Angeles penthouse aparthient . At a time when Fox production officials diplomatically declined to comment for quotation on the television crisis , Charles Skouras was forthright and almost grimly frank . As a man whose heart quite understandably beats for theatrical real estate , Charles Skouras ' prediction seems significant and well worth recording . He believes that the great theatrical chains  --  such as his own  --  will survive , but that the independent theater owner is 0 for very tough sledding . In fact , he predicted that television would eliminate 50 per cent of the movie theaters now existing in the United States . An assistant protested . Skouras stuck to his figure . No one knows just how many movie theaters are operating in the United States ? theaters close and become supermarkets , and in recent years 3000 drive-in theaters have opened and are functioning quietly and profitably ? but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Skouras is right , some 11,000 theaters will turn up their toes and go into a deep sleep . This seems to a good many other ' informed men an extreme figure . Some of them expect a 25 per cent casualty list . Others , regretfully , raise the figure to 33 per cent . But the truth is , nobody knows . The significant fact is that all the theater owners I interviewed had a pessimistic view of the future . They all agreed , although they differed among themselves on details , that free television would clip their wings and sprain their cash registers . It should be made clear , however , that they were not discussing present-day television with its limited Outlets ; they were concerned for the future . After the three-year freeze ( Continued on Page 70 ) THE BIG BRAWL : HOLLYWOOD vs . TELEVISION ( Continued from Page 19 ) on the issuance of licenses , the Federal Communications Commission now believes that there will be room for at least 1800 television stations in the country . Frank M. Folsom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with the utilization of ultra-high-frequency channels there may he nearly 3000 stations . Compare the 108 stations which have already drawn a bead on the box office with the 3000 which may be in action in a few years , and you have an accurate idea of the facts which worry the exhibitors . Folsom predicts that if there are 3000 stations the number of TV sets in this country will be increased to 50,000,000 . These same facts worry the four television networks  --  American Broadcasting Company , National Broadcasting Company , Columbia Broadcasting Company and Dumont . Where will they find the talent to fill the available hours ? In Hollywood , at a cost of many millions of dollars , the major studios last year produced in feature films  --  excluding shorts and newsreels  --  about 426 hours of entertainment . The appetite of television is like the great maw of the sperm whale . Thousands of hours of entertainment must be available to the television public , and any guess as to where it will come from is  --  as one advertising-agency executive told me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showman , has several times proved his adaptability to new mediums . A star in variety and the Ziegfeld Follies thirty years ago , he repeated his success in movies and on the radio , and has now transferred his loyalty to television . Cantor has no illusions about the demands television makes upon talent . " Sometimes , " he told a reporter , " it took ten years in the old days to work up a vaudeville act that satisfied the customers . But then , on Keith and Orpheum time , you could play it interminably . So what happens now ? A vaudeville turn goes on television and then it 's dead . So what can the actors do ? You know the answer . They can go out and spend ten more years building up to another twenty-six minutes on television . It 's brutal . " The movie business wallowed in wealth during the war and after . A neighbor of mine in Washington who owns a chain of theaters in the South told me that his audiences were so overlarge that they became  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuisance to management and to the public peace . Because there were so few ways to spend money , the public endowed the theater box office prodigally . It was an era of free-wheeling in Hollywood . The profits of the studios there were so handsome and the war taxes were so high that executives refused to worry about costs . It was a bonanza time for novelists and playwrights lucky enough to have salable wares . High story costs , high talent costs , high production costs , kept no one awake at night . All these , from the bookkeeping point of view , could be written off as expenses . And why stint on expenses when a certain profit was assured and any added profit , by the tax schedules , would accrue mainly to the Federal Treasury ? And why bother with better pictures ? Few companies did . There was a harvest of rubbishy films after the war  --  interspersed occasionally with prestige " art " films of a gloomy nature  --  that alienated the older and more selective patrons as other recreational facilities gradually became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By midsummer last year an austerity regime  --  or what Hollywood considers an austerity regime  --  was in force at many studios . Brothers-in-law had been scissored from the payrolls , there was a businesslike approach to prepicture planning , shooting schedules were more rigidly adhered to , story costs were sharply trimmed . When a famous director , and a good one , demanded that not less than $2,000,000 be spent on any picture he directed , his studio did not renew his contract . Warner Broth-era made it known that $1,000,000 was to be top budget for their A pictures . Twentieth Century-Fox told its producers that budgets for run-of-the-mill features should not exceed $1,200,000 . Fox , in fact , made an experiment in economy which other major studios watched with avid interest . Spyros Skouras urged his contract employees who earned $500 a week or more to take a voluntary sliding-scale reduction in salary . This achieved wide publicity and brought the Screen Actors ' Guild , the Screen Writers ' Guild and the Screen Directors ' Guild winging into action . They instructed members not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Hollywood 's past . Back in an earlier box-office panic  --  it was in 1933 ? another big studio pleaded with its actors , directors and writers to accept a sweeping salary cut for eight weeks for the good of the common cause . They responded loyally , only to discover that many of the front-office executives had neglected to take the cut themselves . This was adjudged had faith and was responsible , snore than any other single factor , for bringing the highly individualistic talent gentry under the big tent of unionism . The current Fox maneuver was , on the whole , a failure . A few individuals joylessly accepted pay reductions , but the majority did not . A friend of mine  --  an eminent producer earning $5000 a week or more  --  was invited to dock himself 50 per cent . He honestly sympathized with studio efforts to reduce costs , and , in preparing his picture budgets , co-operated fully . His enthusiasm for personal sacrifice was curbed by the fact that Fox was currently paying the regular two-dollar dividend on its 2,769,000 shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told me , he did not see why the working stiffs should carry the whole load . He sent regrets . A fortnight after I reached the Coast the air of gloom began to lift . Even first assistant directors felt better . Always mercurial , the film colony was immensely cheered by the record-breaking run of The Great Caruso at Radio City Music Hall , the enthusiastic reception at previews of MGM 's Showboat and the $6,000,000 spectacle Quo Vadis . " It 's the same old story , " said one executive blithely . " Television was supposed to be keeping them away from the ball parks . But 67,000 people  --  the biggest weekday crowd in histdrylast July watched the Yankees play the Red Sox . If you give ' em a good show , they 'll come to see it . " This " era of good feeling , " many observers believe , has no more significance than the gravedigger months which preceded it . They are convinced that a few or even a good many hit pictures will not preserve the picture industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item of reference they point to the advance of television stocks in the financial marts and the regression of motion-picture stocks . A summary of their relationship was prepared for this article by the analysts of a well-known Wall Street investment house . First , year-end prices of stocks for four major film companies  --  Columbia , Loew 's , Inc. , Twentieth Century-Fox Film , Warner Brothers Pictures  --  were compared with the five-year record of four TV-set manufacturing companies ? Admiral , Motorola , Emerson Radio &; Phonograph , Philco . In the five-year period , 1946 through 1950 , motionpicture-company stocks declined 40 per cent while television-company stocks increased 243 per cent . Second , in the rising market of June , 1948 , to December , 1950 , film-company stocks remained practically unchanged , while the average price of television-company stocks increased 60 per cent . During this same period the Dow-Jones averages of all listed stocks showed an advance of 46 per cent . Records were also compared at two periods , June , 1947 , and June , 1949 , when the market as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of motion-picture-company stocks declined 25 per cent while teleriaion stocks increased 71 per cent . It is the opinion of these nonindustry men  --  and some within the film trades too ? that technological changes of tremendous scope are in progress and that it is impossible to envision with accuracy the entertainment pattern of , say , 1954 . It is highly possible that , the answers will be found , not in controversy or the Great Debate , but in the laboratories of the Eastman Kodak Company , the Bell Laboratories of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , and the laboratories of a score of other corporations . These observers who are , for the moment , above the battle , hold out a little left-handed comfort to the motion-picture industry . They believe that the television networks , who fancy themselves now in the driver 's seat , are in for plenty of trouble too . They suspect that the network system , which made the radio chains potent and powerful , 71 may not be the sure-shot answer to the problems of the new medium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows promise headaches and heartaches for the advertising agencies ? who now serve as middlemen in the radio and television world of commercially sponsored entertainment . Of these complex situations I shall have more to say in subsequent articles . The basic struggle in the television-movie war , it should be realized , is between free entertainment in the home and theatrical real estate . In this country about $3,000,000,000 is invested in film theaters . Many of the movie palaces were built with lavish expenditure and on strategic and high-priced heartof-the-city sites . Without well-filled houses and large box-office receipts , these enterprises can not keep their heads above water . It is probably true that failing attendance in the last several years can not be blamed entirely on television . Other businesses have faced the problem of urban congestion ; department stores have established neighborhood branches , installed free parking lots . I asked a young married man in Los Angeles why he and his wife had abandoned theater attendance . " First , I have to change my clothes after work , " he said . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown in heavy traffic , fork up fifty cents at a parking lot , and walk seven blocks to pay about two dollars for two tickets . It 's too much trouble and it costs too much . " A current organized drive to recapture the film audience , participated in by both the exhibitors and the Hollywood studios , confesses in its agreed-upon credo that enthusiastic showmanship has been conspicuous by its absence . Ronald Reagan , the personable leading man who is president of the Screen Actors ' Guild , has made several goodwill trips through the Middle West and South during the last year in the interest of pictures . Reagan was frank in a conversation with me . " After the depression , " he said , " the showman was the only businessman who did n't try to make it . easy for the customers to buy his wares . The movie theaters made it hard , and still do . " Nevertheless , it is understandable that the exhibitors exhorted the studios not to give hostages to the enemy by permitting contract stars to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old films available for telecasting . It is understandable that the major studios respected their wishes , and , in the main , still do . There are certain facts of life in respect to television and the movie industry with which the average citizen is only indifferently acquainted . Television , as presently constituted , follows the pattern of radio ; a free program is made available to the householder because some advertiser foots the bill . There are limits to the price a business concern can pay to advertise tooth paste , cigarettes or motorcars . An average good Hollywood picture costs at least $1,000,000 . Perhaps it should n't , but it does . How many advertising sponsors will spend that kind of money for one program ? If at present it is only through the theaters that Hollywood can manage a profitable return on an investment of a million dollars , it is clear just where , until the situation clarifies itself , Hollywood loyalties must lie . One of the top pictures of 1950 ? which cost five or six times a million dollars and yanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. deM ille spectacle Samson and Delilah . This seems destined to be one of the big moneymakers of all time , but it may take three years for the producing company to realize its investment . The studios , however restive , can market their present expensive product through the theaters alone . Two of the theater chains  --  Fox and United Paramount ? have already marshaled their resources to wrestle for audiences . Their counterblow is theater television . Theater TV is by definition the exclusive showing in a theater or group of theaters of some special event . The first experiment was made last June with the Joe Louis-Lee Savold match in New York . By agreement with the International Boxing Club , sponsor of the match , there was no home telecast . Eight theaters in six cities turned the customers away . Since that time there has been ample evidence that theater television can fill theaters for an important boxing match and pay the promoters as much as $250,000 for exclusive rights , and also do no harm to the box office , because , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the match originates . When Sugar Ray Robinson fought Randy Turpin in New York and regained his middleweight title , there were riots in Chicago theaters because , with the auditoriums already full , thousands sought admission . Theater television is often referred to as " Big Screen TV . " Actually the regular movie screen is used , but special installations are necessary , which originally cost about $25,000 and are now somewhat cheaper . At the present writing , about 100 theaters are equipped and the number is expected to rise shortly to 150 . I saw a rerun of the Louis-Savold fight at the United Paramount offices in New York , and reception and image were excellent . Paramount pioneered in theater television . After the war , the FCC made certain ultra-high-frequency bands available for experimentation by theater-TV interests . Only two companies applied for and received experimental permits . Paramount began its trial runs in the New York City area in 1947 . Twentieth Century-Fox came along a year later . These experimentshave resulted in two principal systems of theater TV . One is Paramount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film  --  not kinescope  --  develops the film in less than one minute and projects the picture on the theater screen . Twentieth Century-Fox purchased Eidophor , a Swiss system in which the televised event is picked up instantly and instantly projected on the theater screen . There is a third system , called Skiatron . Its sponsors claim it can be installed in theaters more cheaply than the other systems . Actually most theater men are indifferent as to the way the image gets on the screen . They are interested in how it gets into the theater . At the moment , under FCC regulations , the televising must be done for the theaters by a regular TV-broadcasting station . If it is to be sent to other cities , time must be rented on the coaxial cable of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company . So tangled is the web of current rivalries that NBC , noisy apostle of free entertainment for set owners , sells its TV lacilities to theaters for theater television . Radio Corporation of America , parent company of NBC , makes the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a profit by televising top boxing matches in their houses . Their program has a deeper purpose  --  to make the theater again the citadel of top-flight entertainment , to re-establish the theater-going habit . Both Fox and Paramount see television in the theaters as an adjunct to motion pictures rather than as a substitute . Charles Skouras , so pessimistic about the survival of independent movie houses , believes the Fox chain can bring many splendors to its audiences . He foresees the televising of live performances at the Metropolitan Opera House , of ballet , perhaps of the Broadway openings of sumptuous musicals like South Pacific or The King and I. " The weakness of the independent house , " says Skouras , " is lack of big capital . There are more than 500 Fox theaters . If a group of them put up $500 each there is immediately a substantial sum available to buy a special television event . " Leonard Goldenson , the trim , fortyfive-year-old president of United Paramount , is not indifferent to the power of bigness . Originally there were 938 theaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600 in the United States . Goldenson and Paramount secretary-treasurer , Robert H. O'Brien  --  a lawyer and former member of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission ? have ambitious plans for the use of television in their theaters . They see in it a pictorial journalism with the most exciting possibilities  --  possibilities which , up until t he present time , have not been realized on by sponsored telecasting . At the moment , they are planning from twelve to twenty " special-events " television shows a year for the United Paramount chain . Another development of importance was the merger last summer of United Paramount and the American Broadcasting Company , two organizations which would seem at first glance to have contradictory interests . This has been approved by the stockholders of both companies , but it does not yet have the all-important approval of the FCC . Hollywood accepts the merger as evidence that a happy compromise can be achieved in the most difficult of circumstances  --  and that all is not lost .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
