The New Year message from Russia was that 1956 would see a full-scale resumption of the cold war . <P> The message was delivered at a carefully planned session of the Supreme Soviet in Moscow at which Premier Nikolai Bulganin and Party Secretary Nikita Khrushchev rejected the spirit of peaceful compromise so widely advertised at Geneva last July . Khrushchev 's attack on the U.S. and President Eisenhower was stronger than anything heard in the U.S.S.R. since the days of Dictator Stalin . Both Bulganin 's and Khrushchev 's speeches had warlike overtones , Bulganin speaking of the recent development of " intercontinental " rockets and Khru shchev virtually threatening the West with the new Soviet H-bomb . <P> " Definite Shift . " The revival of belligerency apparently sprang from the Soviet leaders ' assessment of their strength in south Asia , from which they had just returned . They came home arrogant with success . Said Bulganin : " The peoples of Asia have begun waking up and straightening their shoulders . The factors which contributed to this great awakening have been the great October 1917 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers as a result of the first , and particularly the second , World War . . . The time would come , Lenin used to say , when hundreds of millions of people in Asia would become an active factor in world history . . . This time has now come . " <P> Then Bulganin stated the objects and achievements of the trip . Said he : " The peoples of the Asian countries can not but feel alarmed over the establishment of such aggressive military alignments as SEATO and the recently designed Baghdad pact . " These , said Bulganin , were simply " a manifestation of colonialism in another form . " Any enemy of these pacts could count on Russia as its friend ; in particular , the Communists support India 's and Afghanistan 's claims against Pakistan , and , boasted Bulganin , this tactic has paid off : " When we went to India , we knew we could expect a warm welcome . But what we have seen and heard exceeded all our expectations . " <P> Said Bulganin , summing up : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of a definite shift in the strained inter national situation . . . This shift is in a large measure due to the efforts of the Soviet Union . " For the benefit of Asian listeners , Bulganin called anew for the outlawing of atomic weapons , " including rocket weapons which have been recently developed into weapons of intercontinental power . " <P> But the keystone speech was that of Party Secretary Khrushchev . Said he : " Today some apologists of the colonial regime say : do n't you see , we voluntarily granted freedom to India . But if they had tried to remain in India . . . they would have been swept out by the Indian people just as the Chinese people have expelled from China the colonialists of every shade and color , and together with them the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique . " ( The applause at this point was officially described as " stormy . " )
