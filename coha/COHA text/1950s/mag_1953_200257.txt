Many of the earliest humans lived on sea food , picking up clams and oysters . Later , man largely deserted the sea as a source of food . Now , with the land filling up with people , the sea looks good again . In Agricultural and Food Chemistry . Dr. Francis Joseph Weiss , Austrian-born chemist , tells how man might harvest the sea 's bumper crops . <P> On the average , says Dr. Weiss , an acre of sea grows nearly three times as much plant material as an acre of land . Nearly all sea-growing plants are microscopic phytoplankton ( mainly diatoms and dinoflagellates ) that form the broad base of a " food pyramid . " They are eaten by slightly bigger zooplahkton , and these small grazers are processed in the stomachs of bigger and bigger carhivora . The food in the original plants diminishes by nine-tenths at each eating . So when a human fisherman catches a fine codfish , each pound of its flesh represents about 100,000 lbs . of plants that grew in the sea . This process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to harvest the lower , broader stages of the food pyramid . <P> The phytoplankton is probably too small , but great whales gather the zooplankton , and man should be able to do the same . Dr. Weiss quotes a British opinion that two fishermen with suitable nets could catch about 600 Ibs. of zooplankton a day off the coast of Scotland . The stuff is a paste with a delicate shrimpy flavor . <P> Some of the small carnivora feed near the surface at night and retire during the daytime to a lower level where they can be spotted by echo-sounding devices . Dr. Weiss believes that special vessels could drop flexible hoses into these living strata and suck up enormous quantities of edible zooplankton . <P> Man must also learn , says Chemist Weiss , to preserve this new and perishable crop . A science of marine chemistry is developing rapidly to do the job by dehydration or chemical treatment . Already many fish products , e.g. , fish flour and fish concentrates , are being made imperishable enough to be shipped to any part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on such stuff exclusively , they would never make a dent in the 135 billion tons of carbon ( equivalent to 350 billion tons of starch ) that is fixed every year in the fertile fields of the sea .
