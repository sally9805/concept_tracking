Not so long ago , the U.S. Davis Cup squad-on paper , at least-looked as though it had an even chance of bringing the cup back from Australia this December . Dick Savitt , Australian and Wimbledon champion , was thelogical No.1 man in singles . Up &; coming Tony Trabert , U.S. clay court champion , could play the No. 2 singles , and team with veteran Billy Talbert in the doubles . Then the paper plans began to go up in smoke . A week after Trabert was ordered to duty with the Navy , Talbert quit the squad to go back to work as a salesman for the Security Banknote Co. in Manhattan . <P> With two-thirds of his paper team up the chimney , non-playing captain Frank Shields now has a squad that might well have its hands full with little Sweden in the interzone final . Remaining members : Savitt ; Vic Seixas , who lost the U.S. championship to Australia 's Frank Sedgman in straight sets ; Budge Patty , who has never regained the touch that made him 1950 Wimbledon champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shields says he has one hope left : the chance of the Navy 's transferring Trabert to Australia for temporary duty just at Davis Cup time .
