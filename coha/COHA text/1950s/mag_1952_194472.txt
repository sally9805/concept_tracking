Mexico 's President Miguel Aleutian likes to claim as one of the most notable achievements of his six years in office the successful rise of Pemex , the government oil monopoly . Recently , when his government raised a monument to Pemex in Mexico City 's Paseo de la Reforma , the pedestal bore not only the famous 1938 expropriation decree of President Lazaro Cardenas , but quotations from a 1936 pro-expropriation speech by Aleman , then the youthful governor of Veracruz . Last week , in the final month of his presidential term , President Aleman flew to the Gulf Coast jungles to inspect Pemex ' new Tenixtepec field , the country 's biggest strike since Mexico took over its oil industry . <P> New Pools . Modest as the Tenixtepec find was ( estimated output for 1953 : 50,000 bbls. a day ) , the new field , along with another recent Pemex find in central Tabasco , showed that the Mexicans were at last beginning to bring in new oil to supplement the old fields the foreign companies left them . Already , U.S. crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenixtepec in hopes of tapping new underground pools . Next week , a new ten-inch pipeline will carry the first Tenixtepec oil into Pemex ' 1,200-mi. national network . <P> Pemex itself , ridden with politics and labor trouble when Aleman came to power , is now a going business operation . In the opinion of one oldtime Mexico City oilman , it " stands out like a 20,000-ft. mountain when compared with other Mexican government operations . " Over the past six years , as Pemex has ended its anti-U.S . policy and sent technicians north of the border for advanced training , production has increased an average of 15% annually , is now almost double what it was the year before expropriation . Two big refineries have been built at Reynosa and Salamanca , three other refining units have been completely rebuilt , and three more refineries are under construction . This year Pemex is expected to gross $231 million , hand over about $70 million to the national treasury . <P> Clean Hands . Much credit for Pemex ' transformation belongs to hard-driving Antonio Bermudez , the millionaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show in 1946 . Apparently contemplating retirement last week , Bermudez said : " I have handled over 9 billion pesos , and have the right to say my conscience and my hands are clean . " Many Mexicans , convinced that only Bermudez keeps Pemex from ruin by political grafters and grifters. hope that he will be asked to stay on . In Bermudez ' office sits a life-size bust of President-elect Adolfo Ruiz Cortines , but all Bermudez says is : " My commission from President Aleman expires the last day of this month . That 's all I know . I 'm not saying one word about the future . "
