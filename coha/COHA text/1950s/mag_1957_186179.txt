To the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee , during its 1955 investigation of Communism in the press , came a letter from a secret informant who charged over a fictitious signature that " a man named Shelton " was a member of a Communist group on the New York Times . The Senate investigators assumed that their informant was accusing Newsman Willard Shelton , whose name was familiar to them because he had written stories criticizing the subcommittee . But when a process server went to the Times to find Willard Shelton , * he was told that there was no such person on the payroll . Learning that a man named Robert Shelton had a copyreader 's job on the Times , the process server wrote in " Robert " for " Willard " on the subpoena and handed it to Timesman Shelton . <P> To the surprise of committee members , who by then were inclined to accept Associate Counsel Julien Sourwine 's judgment that " somebody had bobbled , " Robert Shelton , 30 , refused three times to answer questions about possible Communist affiliations at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Manhattan newsmen , he invoked the First Amendment ( freedom of speech and the press ) ; all four were indicted for contempt of Congress ( TIME , Dec. 10 ) . <P> Shelton , the first of the " uncooperative " newsmen to go to trial , called no witnesses when his case was heard last week in Washington by Federal Judge Ross Rizley . Instead , Defense Attorney Joseph L. Rauh Jr. , chairman of Americans for Democratic Action , argued that the investigation was illegal because it served " no valid legislative purpose , " that the subcommittee had no more right to question Shelton than any other " man off the street , " heard his testimony solely to " expose him and others to contempt and ridicule . " The investigation was a " reprisal " against the Times , which had frequently criticized the segregationist views of Mississippi 's Democratic Senator James Eastland , subcommittee chairman . Rauh pointed out that 30 of the 38 witnesses called to testify in closed session were current or onetime employees of the Times , and the subcommittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to investigate any other paper . <P> After a two-day trial without jury , Judge Rizley found Shelton guilty of contempt , dismissed as " patently unsound " Rauh 's argument that the investigation was 1 ) illegal , and 2 ) aimed specifically at the Times . <P> Judge Rizley fined Mrs. Mary Knowles , 46 , the Plymouth Meeting , Pa. librarian who was found guilty of contempt of Congress ( TIME , Jan. 21 ) , $500 and sentenced her to 120 days in jail-longest term ever handed a woman for contempt of Congress . <P> <P> * Who had never worked for the Times . He is an assistant editor of the AFL-CIO News in Washington .
