Gentle summer breezes played along the shoreline of Green Lake , Wis. , across the rolling carpet of the 18-hole golf course , the tennis courts , the spacious yacht basin . But not the click of a driver was heard , or a splash from the water . Sitting on folding chairs under the oak trees were 800-odd men , women and children celebrating with hymns , prayers and well-chosen words the tenth anniversary of a summer gathering place for American ( Northern ) Baptists . <P> Sitting near the 45-voice choir , staring modestly down at the grass when speakers praised him , was Dr. Luther Wesley Smith , 56 , executive secretary of the American Baptist Assembly .

The Baptists took it over for a trifling $300,000 ( current evaluation : about $11,000,000 ) , and converted it into one of the most luxurious church centers in the U.S. : an 81 - room hotel was already standing , the " largest barn in Wisconsin " became an 800-seat auditorium , an old hog barn became a 22-bedroom residence and dormitory . The result was a kind of apogee of the nature-loving , creature-comfortable Christianity for which the U.S. is noted . " Beauty , godliness and away-from-the-city fellowship , " according to Smith , lead Green Lakers to " a closer walk with God " ( in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Business calls its conferences in places where it can press the total impact of its message .
