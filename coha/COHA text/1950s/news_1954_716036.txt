txt Termination of a treaty of 1794 under which cotton cloth has been distributed to New York Indians since George Washington was President is the objective of a bill introduced today in the Senate . The measure would discharge the obligation assumed in the Government 's earliest days by providing a lump-sum settlement of the " annuity " distributed annually as cotton cloth . The Six Nations have insisted on this bounty as a symbol of their sovereignty and of title to their lands . The proposed legislation actually constitutes an offer to the Indians to bring this practice to an end . They would not be required by its terms to accept . And since one Indian Bureau emissary after another has been told . firmly by the tribes that the word of " G. Washington " still stands , there is - little prospect of ending the ancient treaty right . Informal explanation of the bill by the Indian Ilureau said enactment would constitute a " standing offer " should the New York tribes change their minds and decide to assume the rights and prerogatives of citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Seneca nation and Tonawanda band of Senecas were introduced by Senator Hugh Butler , Republican of Nebraska , chairman of the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee , as the final move under Concurrent Resolution 108 of the last session to grant full citizenship rights and remove Federal supervision from Indians in ten areas . These Indians are considered by Congress capable of running their own affairs . The Senecas also figure in the distribution of cloth to which the Six Nations bill applies . The Iroquois Confederacy , Consisting originally of the Mohawk , Oneida , Onondaga , Cayuga and Seneca tribes , with the later addition of the Tuscarora , was called the Five or Six Nations by the English colonists . In preRevolutionary days they wielded considerable power and at one time formed the balance of power between the French and EngThey sided with the English , which had " something to do with the loss of Canada by the French . Most of them also aided with the English during the Revolution , and many subsequently settled in Canada , Those remaining in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Large numbers of the Oneida tribe went to Wisconsin and of the Seneca to Oklahoma , while most of the Mohawks went to Canada , and thus do not share in the distribution of the cloth . Under the annuity arrangement $1,800 in cash has gone annually since 1830 to the Oneidas , who moved to Wisconsin , and $2,700 has been spent for calico , gingham and sheeting for the New York tribes . Timothy Pickering actually drew up and signed the 1794 treaty with the Six Nations which set forth that " because the United States desire , with humanity and kindness , to contribute to their comfortable support , " the United States now deliver certain goods and further will create a sum " in the whole four thousand five hundred dollars which shall be expended yearly forever , in purchasing cloathing , domestic animals , implements of husbandry and other utensils . " ' Clothing ' by Request William Binge of the Indian Bureau , who was superintendent of the New York Indian Agency from 1946 until it was closed in 1949 , said that " cloathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been cotton cloth , and no Federal money ever was spent on anything else , under the treaty .. He said the custom had been that an order for the cloth , which the Indian Bureau procures by " shopping around , " was put in as soon as possible after the spring appropriation bill was passed . The cloth is ready for distribution in the fall . " When I was distributing it , the bureau bought calico mostly and tried to get as much variety of pattern as possible , " he added . " The newspapers in our New York area would put out announcements as to what day the cloth would be distributed for each tribe . I 'd take the bolts down to the Council House , hire a few helpers , set up some long tables and we were in business . " As each customer came up we 'd ask whetl1r he or she was entitled to 1 , 2 , 3 or more shares , and as he or she picked cloth , we 'd check the family off the list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders from tribal members who could n't get there ? and we would check them off . Costs Reduce Yardage " Some of the old Indians used to tell about how their grandfathers had to bring wagons to carry off the heavy bolts when cloth was 2 or 3 cents a yard . But lately it has been 40 or 50 cents a yard , and the Indian rolls have been increasing . Some years one share was as little as half a yard . " Since the New York office was closed a man has been sent from the Indian Bureau to take charge of the distribution . The last annual yardage figure was 12,396 . This is in marked contrast to the 20,552 yards of gingham and 20,548 yards of sheeting bought for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1912 . During World War I , so records at the National Archives show , there was a plan to . distribute sheeting only if gingham went any higher because of the scarcity of German dyes . The Government was buying gingham then , 1915 , at 75 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
