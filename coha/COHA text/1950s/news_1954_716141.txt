WASHINGTON , March 14 ? Roy M. Cohn acknowledged tonight that the staff of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was being asked to sign a loyalty pledge to him . The 27-year-old subcommittee counsel , under heavy fire over the Army 's accusation that he sought favors for a subcommittee associate , denied , however , that he told two women who declined to sign that it " would be the worse for those that refused . " " That is absolutely untrue , " he said . " I never made any such statement . " Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , the subcommittee chairman , and Mr. Cohn were named in a thirty-four-page Army report Thursday . They were taxed with having sought to obtain first a commission and then special privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an unpaid subcommittee constultant before his induction into the Army . Senator Favors Own Inquiry Mr. Cohn , interviewed tonight on " Meet the Press , " National Broadcasting television program , reiterated that the Army charge was false . He also repeated his accusation that the Army had sought to use Private Schine as a " bargaining point " to halt the McCarthy investigation . In Appleton , Wis. , Senator McCarthy said that lie had a " secret witness " who could support his charge that the Army had tried to divert him from investigating it by offering to provide " dirt " on the Navy or Air Force , ' The United Press reported . Senator McCarthy , returning to Washington tonight by plane , said his subcommittee would meet Tuesday if members were available to decide on procedure . I-18 renewed his offer to testify and allow Senator Karl E. Mundt , Republican of South Dakota , to preside over the inquiry . : The Senator was asked whether he would be in favor of an inquiry into the matter by another committee . He indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other committee was going to tell my subcommittee who we can hire or fire . " The Army report asserted that the special pleading for Mr. Schine , who followed Mr. Cohn to Washington from New York last year , came as the subcommittee was in the midst of a series of investigations involving the Army . Cohn Develops Charge Senator McCarthy fired back the next . day with a charge of " blackmail . " He released a series of memoranda , which he said had been prepared by his staff over the months , charging an effort by high Army officials to get the subcommittee to call off its investigations by holding Mr. Schine as a hostage . He said the Army , still further , offered to provide him with " dirt " on the Navy and Air Force . Mr. Cohn developed this charge on the television show tonight , ' He said that John Adams , Army , counsel , actually had offered to map Air Force bases where there was a mess . Mr. Cohn said that Frank P. Carr , subcommittee stag director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he thought it was " extremely disgraceful that sometime later a specific proposal was made to us that we go after an Air Force base wherein Mr. Adams told us there were a number of sex deviates * * * that would make excellent hearings for us . " " I might say I remember that very clearly , " he said , " because Mr. Adams took out a pad of paper and drew a map of the country and divided it into sections and numbered them one through nine , as I recall it , and told Mr. Carr and myself that if we 'd mark the location . of the Army base which we were about to investigate that he would mark on that map the location of an Air Force base wherein // this mess existed and that we would then be able to go after it . " In the interview Mr. Cohn stater ' . unequivocally that he " did not ask preferential treatment for Dave Schine at any time . " He conceded an arrangement had been worked out with the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to devote himself " after hours and over week-ends " to working on an unfinished report on the overseas information program . " He characterized as " ridiculous " charges in the Army report that he had threatened to " wreck the Army " or had sought to leave the impression that Robert T. Stevens , Secretary of the Army , would be " through " if favors were not granted . The young attorney denied with obvious heat that either the Schine family had a hold on him or that he had a hold on Senator McCarthy . He characterized as " another smear " stories to the effect that his law firm stood to benefit from favors granted young Schine . As for Senator McCarthy , his only hold on the chairman came through the small part he played , as counsel , in helping combat " atheistic communism and Communist infiltration . " With a Congressional inquiry into charge and counter-charge taking shape , Mr. Cohn declined to express a view on whether circulation of a loyalty pledge in his behalf disqualified the McCarthy subcommittee from conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older and wiser heads to decide . " " I will abide by any decision they see'fit to make , " he said . All that he knows about the pledge , the counsel said , was that one of the staff members " told me that such a pledge was being circulated . " " I told him at that time I was very sorry he even told me about it , " Mr. Cohn said , and " that I certainly did not want to see any members of the staff put on the spot . It was my problem and not their problem . " Asked if he had not refused to stop the pledge , Mr. Cohn replied that he had refused to take any part in the thing , one way or another , because he felt that is was not his responsibility in any way . Conduct of Inquiry Undecided Just how the Senate inquiry will be conducted remains in doubt . The Senate Republican Policy Committee meets on the question Tuesday . It undoubtedly will consider having the Senate Armed Services Committee act in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican floor leader , urged a quick end to the dispute . He expressed the , belief that perhaps a single day of questioning of the principals involved behind closed doors would settle the controversy . With , a decision still to be made , Senator Henry M. Jackson , Democrat of Washington , proposed that hearings in the matter be conducted jointly by the McCarthy- subcommittee , of which he is a member , and the Armed Services Committee . He urged this because , apart from the matter of getting at the truth , there was involved as well " the right of our committee to hire and fire staff personnel . " He said the subcommittee obviously " must pass on the question of whether Mr. Cohn should stay or whether he should leave . " In view of the sharp conflict over fact , there is strong sentiment for tracing both the McCarthy-Cohn memoranda and the Army report back to their very origins . Mr. Cohn 's account of the circulation of a loyalty pledge in his behalf , some consider , may even lead to taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certain Senators have been urged to find out the stenographers who took notes for the memoranda , the typists who transcribed the notes , the dates when the work was done and where it was done .
