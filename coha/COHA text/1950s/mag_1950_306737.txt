Serious students of Mars , says French Astronomer Gerard de Vaucouleurs ( in a new book , The Planet Mars ; Macmillan , $2 ) , wish that laymen-and some astronomers-did n't spend so much time debating the " canals " of Mars . Do the canals exist , and if so , were they built by intelligent Martians ? " This great quarrel about the canals , " says De Vaucouleurs , " has brought much discredit upon the study of the planet . " It would be better , he thinks , to forget the canals and the Martians for a while and concentrate on studying Mars objectively with science 's brand-new instruments and methods . <P> Dust &; Vegetation . In layman 's language , De Vaucouleurs tells about the new , highly sensitive spectrographs , thermocouples , etc. , which have recently yielded an astonishing amount of information about Mars 's atmosphere , climate and topography . Most experts agree , he says , that the planet 's great light-orange areas are covered with fine dust , probably containing silicon compounds like the soils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contains a little carbon dioxide ( necessary to life as earthlings know it ) , float three kinds of cloud . Near the surface are yellow clouds ( probably airborne dust ) . Higher up , at about six miles , is a thin violet layer , perhaps of much finer dust . Higher still , at six to 19 miles , float blue clouds which astronomers believe may be made of minute ice crystals , like cirrus clouds on earth . <P> The brilliant white patches that form in winter on the polar regions of Mars are believed to be ice crystals , probably hoar frost . The layer is very thin and may not even cover the surface completely . When the ice melts as the sunlight gets stronger , a dark fringe is left around its receding edge . This is believed to be moist soil . Simultaneously , the dark patches between the icecap and the Martian equator grow darker progressively , the color change advancing in a sort of wave at about 28 miles a day . The darkening is believed to be a seasonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) caused by moisture from the melting icecap carried to lower latitudes by the wind . <P> Illusions &; Mysteries . With careful objectivity , De Vaucouleurs gives these facts about Mars and many more , but in spite of his good resolutions ; he can not resist discussing the canals either . Some skilled observers , he says , see the straight , criss-crossing canals in great profusion , looking just as if they were leading irrigation water from the icecaps toward the Martian equator . Others see no canals , and claim that they are mere optical illusions caused by too much peering at a hazy , jiggling object that , even in ' the finest telescopes , looks no bigger than the moon . Photographs do not settle the question . During the long exposures needed , Mars moves about too much to show such fine details. * An in-between school holds that " canals " exist , but that they are actually small dots or patches arranged in straight lines . <P> Summing up the arguments of both factions , De Vaucouleurs concludes that " there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most energetic research . . . Mars remains the only planet whose phenomena can not easily be interpreted by the sole use of the physical and chemical laws applied to inorganic matter . "
