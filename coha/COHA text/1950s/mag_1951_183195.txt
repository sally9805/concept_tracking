The candid , flowing testimony of Lieut . General Albert Wedemeyer left the Senators more confused than enlightened . <P> Essentially , spare , studious Al Wedemeyer " was a MacArthur man . " We are losing a hell of a lot of boys , " said he , " and we are filling a bottomless pit . " He saw only two alternatives in the war in Korea : 1 ) fight it to the hilt , or 2 ) get out altogether . If the U.S. pulled out ( he was n't too clear about what would happen to the South Koreans ) , he would plunge into full mobilization at home , break diplomatic relations with all Communist countries , and confront Russia with an ultimatum . " I think the time is coming , " he said , " when we will just have to draw a line and say , ' No more-this is it . ' " <P> Contradictions . He testified one day that a truce in Korea at the 38th parallel would be " tantamount to ... defeat " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truce were offered , he would jump at it . He was emphatic in saying that the U.S. should be careful to work " under the aegis of the United Nations , " yet he also said , " if they do n't go along with us , I say we go alone . " He took issue with the judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the whole broad strategy of the Korean war , yet advised the Senators : " I think that this committee ought to heed what they say very carefully . They are all very fine , competent men . " <P> The nature of Wedemeyer 's long and honored career in the Army helped to explain the peculiar quality of his testimony-sometimes bold , sometimes tentative , frequently inconclusive . A staff officer most of his life , Wedemeyer is a classic specimen of what the Army calls a Brain , an officer who is on speaking terms with history , economics and geopolitics , as well as with smaller military subjects . Every important Army unit needs a Brain almost as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a tactical commander , Wedemeyer had devoted his army service to being a staff officer ; eventually he got to be one of the biggest in the Army ( between October 1948 and August 1949 , when he was deputy Army chief of staff in charge of planning ) . His function was not to make final decisions ( as a regimental commander must ) , but to lay down clearly all the ramifications of a situation and all the possible decisions , make recommendations for somebody else to choose from . Such thinking habits seemed to be guiding Wedemeyer last week . <P> A Greek 's Words . In some respects , though , General Wedemeyer was the most refreshing of all the military witnesses who had appeared in the MacArthur hearing . He clearly had no ax to grind . He admitted freely that he had not always been right in the past . At one point , he said : " I do n't believe the military has ever solved an international problem , nor will . It just expands , perpetuates and breeds hate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wedemeyer would admit to puzzlement . " Senator , " he told Oregon 's Wayne Morse in one exchange , " that is a good question-you are asking damned good ones . " <P> At the end of three days as a witness , Wedemeyer gave the committee a brief , well-put-together lecture on geopolitics . Its thesis : seize the initiative . For his punch lines , he went back to 351 B.C. and a speech by Demosthenes :
