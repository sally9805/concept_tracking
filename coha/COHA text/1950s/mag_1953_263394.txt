In contemporary American composition , as in the classical repertory , there is a standard style . Among its characteristics are a cool , outdoorsy kind of counterpoint that is dissonant but not harsh , an energetic rhythm that is neither brawny nor strikingly brainy , and a kind of melody that is homely , and sometimes even folksy . In short , it is middle-of-the-way modernity-and it predominates in the first release of Columbia 's new Modern American Music Series ( 6 LPs ) . <P> Two works are standouts : pioneering Modernist Charles Ives 's Piano Sonata No. 1 ( 1902-09 ) and Aaron Copland 's Sextet for String Quartet , Clarinet and Piano ( 1937 ) . The Ives , expertly played by William Masselos , is a monumental piece that combines deep lyricism with exuberant imagination . The Copland , a chamber-music version of his concise Short Symphony , is pleasantly full of musical playfulness and ingenuity . <P> Of the rest , only Wallingford Riegger 's Quartet No. 2 , Op. 43 ( 1948 ) , played by the New Music String Quartet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harpsichord ( 1945 ) , played by Alexander Schneider and Ralph Kirkpatrick , are likely to leave much of an impression on a first-listener 's mind . Other modern composers whose works are represented : John Cage , Ingolf Dahl , Lou Harrison , Ellis Kohs , Douglas Moore , William Schuman , Virgil Thomson . <P> Other new records : <P> Berlioz : Funeral and Triumphal Symphony ( Great Symphonic Brass and String Orchestras of Cologne and Klnischer Choir , conducted by Fritz Straub ; Lyrichord ) . One of Berlioz ' most theatrical conceptions , opening with a death rattle on the drums and ending with a brassy quickstep and choral finale . Recording : not so evenly balanced as some , but worth hearing for the music . <P> International Musical Eisteddfod ( Westminster , 2 LPs ) . First recordings of a unique event that lures choruses and dancers from a dozen countries into a sleepy Welsh valley every year . High points : a velvety-voiced male choir from Rossendale , England , and choruses from Britain , Italy and the U.S. in competitive versions of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laszlo , soprano ; Vienna State Opera Orchestra conducted by Argeo Quadri ; Westminster ) . Five masterful arias that never appear in operas-although two of them are virtually scenes in themselves-and are rarely sung with orchestra . Soprano Laszlo has a large dramatic voice and she sings intelligently . <P> Mozart : Zaide ( Mattiwilda Dobbs , Hugues Cuenod ; Paris Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Rene Leibowitz ; Polymusic , 2 LPs ) . A little-known but musically appealing opera written when Mozart was only 23 . Soprano Dobbs , an American Negro , delivers her arias with rare feeling for their contours . <P> Puccini : Tosca ( Renata Tebaldi , Giuseppe Campora , Enzo Mascherini ; Chorus and Orchestra of St. Cecilia Academy , Rome , conducted by Alberto Erede ; London , 2 LPs ) . The fifth full-length LP recording of Puccini 's old pulse-bumper . Soprano Tebaldi 's richly passionate Tosca , Tenor Campora 's angel-voiced Cavaradossi , and a fine over-all production are well worth hearing .                  @ @ @
