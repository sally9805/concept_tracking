Everybody on Chicago 's South Side-and in U.S. medicine-knows what Michael Reese is : a first-rate hospital center that treats countless charity cases as well as paying patients . <P> But if anybody in the neighborhood is asked about Michael Reese , whose name is carved in bold stone above the main entrance , he has a hard time answering . " A German immigrant who made his fortune in California real estate , " is the accepted version . The cynical have more colorful addenda . Reese ( ne Ries ) was a peddler who went to California in the wake of the Forty-Niners and , some say , made himself a stake by rolling gold-laden drunks as a sideline . <P> <P> After he had piled up millions in San Francisco real estate , Reese still refused to pay a nickel for a streetcar ride and thought 25 too much for a dinner . A contemporary described him sitting in his shabby office , " before him a large pile of $1,000 U.S. Government bonds , and he was clipping off the coupons . That face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripe cherry , or a mother gazing down into the face of her pretty sleeping child . " To a Methodist preacher , Reese once said : " My love of money is a sort of insanity , but it is as good a form of madness as any . " <P> Getting on in years , Reese decided to visit his parents ' grave in Germany . But he would not pay a few pfennigs to the cemetery gatekeeper . One legend has it that he tried to climb the fence , impaled himself on a rusty iron spike and died of blood poisoning . Another version : he died of apoplexy when asked to pay . <P> Barbery Coast . Bachelor Reese 's will said that his heirs ( mostly in-laws ) should use $200,000 of his $2,000,000 fortune for charity . They decided in 1879 to back a hospital , adding carefully that it was " to be called the Michael Reese Hospital for all time to come . " Also they ruled " that the hospital be nonsectarian , that the sufferers , no matter of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , be admitted . " The site , 29 blocks south of the Loop , was then on the lake shore and in the city 's most fashionable residential area . But the district hit the skids , and wealthy residents moved to the near North Side . In the 1920s , mansions were cut up into tenements , populated mostly by poverty-stricken Negroes teeming in from the South . With poverty went crime , and the former Gold Coast became as raffish as any Barbary <P> Coast that old Reese had known : murder and rape , stabbings and gang brawls were the order of any night . The hospital declined with the neighborhood . <P> By the end of World War II , material as well as philanthropists ' money for rehabilitation became available , and the board of directors ( still dominated by Reese 's kin ) had to choose : whether to move the hospital at great expense to another district or try to pull up the near South Side by its bootstraps . The board voted for bootstraps.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
