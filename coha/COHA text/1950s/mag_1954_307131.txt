Joe McCarthy and his friends have cried-again and again-that the fight against internal subversion came to a standstill during the nine months that Joe was embroiled in fights with the Administration and with his Senate colleagues . After censure was voted last week , McCarthy told newsmen that he was " very happy to get this circus over with " so that he could " get back to the job of digging Communists out of the Government . " <P> This line is intended to suggest that Joe is the mainspring of antisubversion activities and that such efforts stop when his energies are turned elsewhere . In fact , during the last nine months the Eisenhower Administration-with nary an assist ( or an acknowledgment ) from Joe-has achieved the following : <P> Under the Smith Act , ten indictments , accusing 49 persons , have been returned . From these , 20 convictions have been won , with other cases still pending . <P> Under the seditious conspiracy laws , two indictments , involving 28 persons , have been brought . There have been 16 convictions , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted for harboring a Communist fugitive , Robert Thompson . <P> Ten persons have been indicted for making false statements under the Communist affidavit clause of the Taft-Hartley Act . Of these , one conviction has been won so far . <P> Eight persons have been indicted on charges of contempt of the House Un-American Activities Committee . <P> <P> Since his Feb. 9 , 1950 speech at Wheeling , W. Va. , McCarthy has accused scores of Government employees of being Communists . But of these , only one man , former State Department Official Val Lorwin , was indicted . Lorwin turned out to be a lifelong antiCommunist , and the case against him was dismissed . In addition , indictments have been returned against three persons charged with contempt of the McCarthy committee . <P> <P> The comparison strongly indicates that Joe 's inactivity did not hurt the antisubversion fight a bit . In fact , it probably helped .
