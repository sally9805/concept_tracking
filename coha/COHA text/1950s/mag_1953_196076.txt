The first time Dr. Johan Hendrik Botha saw green-eyed blonde Mavis , she was clad in rags , covered with veld sores and standing barefooted on the cow-dung floor of a filthy Zulu kraal . Horrified , the doctor , who treats thousands of Zulus in the lonely hills of northern Natal , decided instantly that six-year-old Mavis was a white child ; he took her home . Young Mrs. Botha gave Mavis a good bath , tied her hair in gay ribbons , gave her her first doll , her first shoes and set her at a table to learn to eat with knife &; fork . <P> The Zulus could tell Dr. Botha nothing about the child 's origin , save her name . She could not speak a word of English and the Bothas could only communicate with her through their Zulu kitchen boy . Mavis , however , loved her soft mattress and liked salads better than the Zulu putu ( porridge ) . <P> But last week , though Mavis had left the Zulus , she had not yet found a haven in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of Dr. Botha 's " rescue " of the child . Said the local probation officer : " Mavis may not be of pure European descent . " The Bothas were told that Mavis might be placed in " an institution for colored girls . " For under South Africa 's race laws , people who can not prove their " pure European descent " are judged " colored , " however fair their skin , unless they can show they have " habitually associated " with white persons . And Mavis had spent all her short life with the Zulus . <P> Where was Mavis to go ? She no longer belonged to the Zulus ; in just two short weeks away from the kraal , she was taking on the ways of South African civilization . When the Bothas took her back to the kraal for a visit , her old Zulu " mother " called her " Missie " ( Mistress ) and kissed her . Mavis carefully wiped her lips with a handkerchief and turned away , saying angrily : " I am white , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Dr. Botha said desperately : " We are medically positive the child is pure white . Her eyes , hair , cuticles , gums , all prove she has no color in her . We feel definite that she was abandoned by white parents . "
