" It 's getting so that anyone is just a damned fool to buy anything at retail , " said James Shea , a big Dallas electric-appliance distributor . Shea , like many another U.S. appliance jobber , is finding that more &; more of his business is coming from " discount houses " which offer everything from washing machines , refrigerators and TV sets , down to fountain pens , at 20% to 30% below list price . <P> The discount house is the biggest current phenomenon of U.S. merchandising . It has department stores , small dealers and other established merchants worried sick . To meet the " I can get it for you wholesale " competition , many established dealers have had to cut their own prices . One Chicago department store recently cut $335 General Electric refrigerators to $229 , just $4 above actual cost . Said an executive of a Chicago merchants ' association : " I would estimate that 90% of nationally branded major appliances are sold below the list price . " <P> Discount houses have sprung up all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appliance stores which crowded the field and made things ripe for cutthroat competition ; and 2 ) the U.S. Supreme Court 's breach in fair-trade laws a year ago . Like after-hours saloons , discount houses often issue " membership cards " to their customers . Some discounters have little more than a small office and a catalogue ; the customer orders from the catalogue , and the discounter calls a distributor and has the product delivered . <P> Free Riders . In effect , the discount houses get a free ride on national advertising of nationally distributed brands . Few of them do any advertising of their own , beyond direct mail or the printing of catalogues . Their customers have usually got their preliminary information on comparative quality , model numbers and prices from patient clerks at department stores . <P> Many of the " bargains " are not as good as they look ; frequently they are discontinued models . Furthermore , many discounters tack on " extras " for delivery , provide none of the servicing and repair offered by established dealers . Most also sell for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fastest-growing discount houses , e.g. , Los Angeles ' big B. &; T. Sales Co. ( 1951 volume : $1,100,000 ) and Manhattan 's Masters , Inc. ( $5,000,000 ) , give the normal guarantees and servicing and offer the latest models . Masters , Inc. has even made a deal with the National City Bank by which customers can make time payments . <P> Free Selling . Many retailers angrily denounce manufacturers for failing to cut off supplies to the price slashers . Sunbeam Corp . ( Shavemaster , Mixmaster ) and Simmons Co. ( mattresses ) have done so ; Sunbeam is being sued by Masters for refusing to supply it . But most big manufacturers and distributors look the other way because discount houses move big volumes of goods rapidly . Said a big Westinghouse Electric jobber : " Some of these stores are necessary for our business because they keep us going in slack times . "
