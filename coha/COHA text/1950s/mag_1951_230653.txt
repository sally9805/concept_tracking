Alexander Hilsberg is a man who knows how to bide his time . For 25 years he played his violin in the Philadelphia Orchestra , the last 19 as concertmaster . Most of that time , he was wishing he were a conductor . Says patient Alex Hilsberg : " Each man must wait his call . " <P> Hilsberg 's first important call came in 1946 , when he substituted for ailing Eugene Ormandy in a Carnegie Hall concert , and made a hit with the tough Manhattan critics . By last week , 51-year-old Alex Hilsberg was a full-fledged , and very busy , conductor . <P> He started off the week leading the NBC Symphony ( in Toscanini 's absence ) . Next day , he conducted his own Reading ( Pa . ) Symphony . Then he raced up to Worcester , Mass , to lead the Philadelphia Orchestra , of which he is associate conductor . He finished the week by taking the NBC again . Altogether , he went through five programs with three orchestras , to say nothing of eleven rehearsals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After 25 years spent scraping an acquaintance with the classics , he shuns " interpretations " of them , finds his greatest satisfaction ( as does Toscanini ) in clean and powerful renderings of what the composer wrote . NBC listeners last week found that even Dvorak 's done-to-death " New World " Symphony sounded fresh and clear . <P> Hilsberg got his early violin training in the same St. Petersburg prodigy factory that turned out Heifetz and Milstein . But he has no regrets that he did not contiue a career of concert fiddling . " I could Vt stand up there and play again and again the Tchaikovsky , Beethoven and Brahms concerti . That is like being a painter and being handed a palette with only a few colors . Conducting , you have all the colors you could possibly want . "
