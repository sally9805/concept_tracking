It 's possible that you wo n't agree with us that Pat Pending 's latest adventure is a delightful story  --  possible IF you have n't been used to laughing in recent years . Blue Book printed more than a dozen of these stories by Nelson Bond about the " greatest inventulator of all time " . lighter than you think by NELSON BOND Sandy 's eyes needed only jet propulsion to become flying saucers . Was n't Pat wonderful ? she beamed , at everyone . Some joker in the dear , dead days now virtually beyond recall won two-bit immortality by declaring that , " What this country needs is a good five-cent cigar . " Which is , of course , Victorian malarkey . What this country really needs is a good five-cent nickel . Or perhaps a good cigar-shaped spaceship . There 's a fortune waiting somewhere out in space for the man who can go out there and claim it . A fortune ! And if you think I 'm just talking through my hat , lend an ear ... Joyce started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umpteenth time I suggested she should marry me . She smiled in a way that showed she did n't disapprove of my persistence , but loosed a salvo of devastating negatives . " No deal , " she crisped decisively . " Know why ? No dough ! " " But , sugar , " I pleaded , " two can live as cheaply as one  --  " " This is true , " replied Joyce , " only of guppies . Understand , Don , I do n't mind changing my name from Carter to Mallory . In fact , I 'd rather like to . But I have no desire whatever to be known to the neighbors as ' that poor little Mrs. Mallory in last year 's coat . ' " I 'll marry you , " she continued firmly , " when , as and if you get a promotion . " Her answer was by no stretch of the imagination a reason for loud cheers , handsprings and cartwheels . Because I 'm a Federal employee . The United States Patent Office is my beat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bewhiskered old gentleman in the star-spangled stovepipe and striped britches : it 's permanent . Once you get your name inscribed on the list of Civil Service employees it takes an act of Congress to blast it off again . And of course I do n't have to remind you how long it takes that body of vote-happy windbags to act . Terrapins in treacle are greased lightning by comparison . But advancement is painfully slow in a department where discharges are unheard of and resignations rare . When I started clerking for this madhouse I was assistant to the assistant Chief Clerk 's assistant . Now , ten years later , by dint of mighty effort and a cultivated facility for avoiding Senatorial investigations , I 've succeeded in losing only one of those redundant adjectives . Being my secretary , Joyce certainly realized this . But women have a remarkable ability to separate business and pleasure . So : " A promotion , " she insisted . " Or at least a good , substantial raise . " " In case you do n't know it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lamentably vulgar interest in one of life 's lesser values . Happiness , not money , should be man 's chief goal . " " What good is happiness , " demanded Joyce , " if you ca n't buy money with it ? " " Why hoard lucre ? " I sniffed . " You ca n't take it with you . " " In that case , " said Joyce flatly , " I 'm not going . There 's no use arguing , Don . I 've made up my mind  --  " At this moment our dreary little impasse was ended by a sudden tumult outside my office . There was a squealing shriek , the shuffle of footsteps , the pounding of fists upon my door . And over all the shrill tones of an old , familiar voice high-pitched in triumph . " Let me in ! I 've got to see him instantaceously . This time I 've got it ; I 've absolutely got it ! " Joyce and I gasped , then broke simultaneously for the door as it flew open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and party of the third part . Back to the door and struggling valiantly to defend it stood the receptionist , Miss Thomas . Held briefly but volubly at bay was a red-thatched , buck-toothed individual  --  and I do mean individual !  --  with a face like the map of Eire , who stopped wrestling as he saw us , and grinned delightedly . " Hello , Mr. Mallory , " he said . " Hi , Miss Joyce . " " Pat ! " we both cried at once . " Pat Pending ! " * * * * * Miss Thomas , a relative newcomer to our bailiwick , seemed baffled by the warmth of our greeting . She entered the office with our visitor , and as Joyce and I pumphandled him enthusiastically she asked , " You  --  you know this gentleman , Mr. Mallory ? " " I should say we do ! " I chortled . " Pat , you old naughty word ! Where on earth have you been hiding lately ? " " Surely you 've heard of the great Patrick Pending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " faltered Miss Thomas . " I seem to have heard the name . Or seen it somewhere  --  " Pat beamed upon her companionably . Stepping to my desk , he up-ended the typewriter and pointed to a legend in tiny letters stamped into the frame : Reg . U.S. Pat . Off .  --  Pat . Pending . " Here , perhaps ? " he suggested . " I invented this . And the airplane , and the automobile , and  --  oh , ever so many things . You 'll find my name inscribed on every one . " I , " he announced modestly , " am Pat Pending  --  the greatest inventulator of all time . " Miss Thomas stared at me goggle-eyed . " Is he ? " she demanded . " I mean  --  did he ? " I nodded solemnly . " Not only those , but a host of other marvels . The bacular clock , the transmatter , the predictograph  --  " Miss Thomas turned on Pat a gaze of fawning admiration . " How wonderful ! " she breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat , wriggling . " But it is ! Most of the things brought here are so absurd . Automatic hat-tippers , self-defrosting galoshes , punching bags that defend themselves  --  " Disdainfully she indicated the display collection of screwball items we call our Chamber of Horrors . " It 's simply marvelous to meet a man who has invented things really worth while . " Honestly , the look in her eyes was sickening . But was Pat nauseated ? Not he ! The big goon was lapping it up like a famished feline . His simpering smirk stretched from ear to there as he murmured , " Now , Miss Thomas  --  " " Sandra , Mr. Pending , " she sighed softly . " To you just plain ... Sandy . Please ? " " Well , Sandy  --  " Pat gulped . I said disgustedly , " Look , you two  --  break it up ! Love at first sight is wonderful in books , but in a Federal office I 'm pretty sure it 's unconstitutional , and it may be subversive . Would you mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here squalling about some new invention . Is that correct ? " With an effort Pat wrenched his gaze from his new-found admirer and nodded soberly . " That 's right , Mr. Mallory . And a great one , too . One that will revolutionate the world . Will you give me an applicaceous form , please ? I want to file it immediately . " " Not so fast , Pat . You know the routine . What 's the nature of this remarkable discovery ? " " You may write it down , " said Pat grandiloquently , " as Pat Pending 's lightening rod . " I glanced at Joyce , and she at me , then both of us at Pending . " But , Pat , " I exclaimed , " that 's ridiculous ! Ben Franklin invented the lightning rod two hundred years ago . " " I said lightening , " retorted my redheaded friend , " not lightning . My invention does n't conduct electricity to the ground , but from it . " He brandished a slim baton which until then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With this , " he claimed , " I can make things weigh as much or as little as I please ! " The eyes of Sandy Thomas needed only jet propulsion to become flying saucers . " Is n't he wonderful , Mr. Mallory ? " she gasped . But her enthusiasm was n't contagious . I glowered at Pending coldly . " Oh , come now , Pat ! " I scoffed . " You ca n't really believe that yourself . After all , there are such things as basic principles . Weight is not a variable factor . And so far as I know , Congress has n't repealed the Law of Gravity . " Pat sighed regretfully . " You 're always so hard to convince , Mr. Mallory , " he complained . " But  --  oh , well ! Take this . " He handed me the baton . I stared at it curiously . It looked rather like a British swagger stick : slim , dainty , well balanced . But the ornamental gadget at its top was not commonplace . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , divided into segments scored with vernier markings . I gazed at Pending askance . " Well , Pat ? What now ? " " How much do you weigh , Mr. Mallory ? " " One sixty-five , " I answered . " You 're sure of that ? " " I 'm not . But my bathroom scales appeared to be . This morning . Why ? " " Do you think Miss Joyce could lift you ? " I said thoughtfully , " Well , that 's an idea . But I doubt it . She wo n't even let me try to support her . " " I 'm serious , Mr. Mallory . Do you think she could lift you with one hand ? " " Do n't be silly ! Of course not . Nor could you . " " There 's where you 're wrong , " said Pending firmly . " She can  --  and will . " He reached forward suddenly and twisted the metal cap on the stick in my hands . As he did so , I loosed a cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I experienced a startling , flighty giddiness , a sudden loss of weight that made me feel as if my soles were treading on sponge rubber , my shoulders sprouting wings . " Hold on to it ! " cried Pat . Then to Joyce , " Lift him , Miss Joyce . " Joyce faltered , " How ? Like th-this ? " and touched a finger to my midriff . Immediately my feet left the floor . I started flailing futilely to trample six inches of ozone back to the solid floorboards . To no avail . With no effort whatever Joyce raised me high above her head until my dazed dome was shedding dandruff on the ceiling ! " Well , Mr. Mallory , " said Pat , " do you believe me now ? " " Get me down out of here ! " I howled . " You know I ca n't stand high places ! " " You now weigh less than ten pounds  --  " " Never mind the statistics . I feel like a circus balloon . How do I get down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " advised Pat , " to your normal weight . Careful , now ! Not so fast ! " His warning came too late . I hit the deck with a resounding thud , and the cane came clattering after . Pat retrieved it hurriedly , inspected it to make sure it was not damaged . I glared at him as I picked myself off the floor . " You might show some interest in me , " I grumbled . " I doubt if that stick will need a liniment rubdown tonight . Okay , Pat . You 're right and I 'm wrong , as you usually are . That modern variation of a witch 's broomstick does operate . Only  --  how ? " " That dial at the top governs weight , " explained Pat . " When you turn it  --  " " Skip that . I know how it is operated . I want to know what makes it work ? " " Well , " explained Pat , " I 'm not certain I can make it clear , but it 's all tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gravity and electric energy . What is electricity , for example  --  " " I used to know , " I frowned . " But I forget . " Joyce shook her head sorrowfully . " Friends , " she intoned , " let us all bow our heads . This is a moment of great tragedy . The only man in the world who ever knew what electricity is  --  and he has forgotten ! " " That 's the whole point , " agreed Pending . " No one knows what electricity really is . All we know is how to use it . Einstein has demonstrated that the force of gravity and electrical energy are kindred ; perhaps different aspects of a common phenomenon . That was my starting point . " " So this rod , which enables you to defy the law of gravity , is electrical ? " " Electricaceous , " corrected Pat . " You see , I have transmogrified the polarifity of certain ingredular cellulations . A series of disentrigulated helicosities , activated by hypermagnetation , set up a disruptular wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are ! Ninety-nine percent of the time Pat Pending talks like a normal human being . But ask him to explain the mechanism of one of his inventions and linguistic hell breaks loose . He begins jabbering like a schizophrenic parrot reading a Sanskrit dictionary backward ! I sighed and surrendered all hope of ever actually learning how his great new discovery worked . I turned my thoughts to more important matters . " Okay , Pat . We 'll dismiss the details as trivial and get down to brass tacks . What is your invention used for ? " " Eh ? " said the redhead . " It 's not enough that an idea is practicable , " I pointed out . " It must also be practical to be of any value in this frenzied modern era . What good is your invention ? " " What good , " demanded Joyce , " is a newborn baby ? " " Do n't change the subject , " I suggested . " Or come to think of it , maybe you should . At the diaper level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how to turn Pat 's brainchild into cold , hard cash  --  that 's the question before the board now . " Individual flight a la Superman ? No dice . I can testify from personal experience that once you get up there you 're completely out of control . And I ca n't see any sense in humans trying to fly with jet flames scorching their base of operations . " Elevators ? Derricks ? Building cranes ? Possible . But lifting a couple hundred pounds is one thing . Lifting a few tons is a horse of a different color . " No , Pat , " I continued , " I do n't see just how  --  " Sandy Thomas squeaked suddenly and grasped my arm . " That 's it , Mr. Mallory ! " she cried . " That 's it ! " " Huh ? What 's what ? " " You wanted to know how Pat could make money from his invention . You 've just answered your own question . " " I have ? " " Horses ! Horse racing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't you ? " " I 'm overwhelmed with them , " I nodded wearily . " A secretary who repulses my honorable advances , a receptionist who squeals in my ear  --  " " Listen , Mr. Mallory , what 's the last thing horses do before they go to the post ? " " Check the tote board , " I said promptly , " to find out if I 've got any money on them . Horses hate me . They 've formed an equine conspiracy to prove to me the ancient adage that a fool and his money are soon parted . " " Wait a minute ! " chimed in Joyce thoughtfully . " I know what Sandy means . They weigh in . Is that right ? " " Exactly ! The more weight a horse is bearing , the slower it runs . That 's the purpose of handicapping . But if a horse that was supposed to be carrying more than a hundred pounds was actually only carrying ten  --  Well , you see ? " Sandy paused , breathless . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underestimate the power of a woman , " I said , " when it comes to devising new and ingenious methods of perpetrating petty larceny . There 's only one small fly in the ointment , so far as I can see . How do we convince some racehorse owner he should become a party to this gentle felony ? " " Oh , you do n't have to , " smiled Sandy cheerfully . " I 'm already convinced . " " You ? You own a horse ? " " Yes . Have n't you ever heard of Tapwater ? " " Oh , sure ! That drip 's running all the time ! " Joyce tossed me a reproving glance . " This is a matter of gravity , Donald , " she stated , " and you keep treating it with levity . Sandy , do you really own Tapwater ? He 's the colt who won the Monmouth Futurity , is n't he ? " " That 's right . And four other starts this season . That 's been our big trouble . He shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific weight handicap . To run in next week 's Gold Stakes , for instance , he would have to carry 124 pounds . I was hesitant to enter him because of that . But with Pat 's new invention  --  " She turned to Pat , eyes glowing  --  " he could enter and win ! " Pat said uncertainly , " I do n't know . I do n't like gambling . And it does n't seem quite ethical , somehow  --  " I asked Sandy , " Suppose he ran carrying 124 . What would be the probable odds ? " " High , " she replied , " Very high . Perhaps as high as forty to one . " " In that case , " I decided , " it 's not only ethical , it 's a moral obligation . If you 're opposed to gambling , Pat , what better way can you think of to put the parimutuels out of business ? " " And besides , " Sandy pointed out , " this would be a wonderful opportunity to display your new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What do you say ? " Pat hesitated , caught a glimpse of Sandy 's pleading eyes , and was lost . " Very well , " he said . " We 'll do it . Mr. Mallory , enter Tapwater in the Gold Stakes . We 'll put on the most spectaceous exhibition in the history of gambilizing ! " * * * * * Thus it was that approximately one week later our piratical little crew was assembled once again , this time in the paddock at Laurel . In case you 're an inland aborigine , let me explain that Laurel race track ( from the township of the same name ) is where horse fanciers from the District of Columbia go to abandon their Capitol and capital on weekends . We were briefing our jockey  --  a scrawny youth with a pair of oversized ears  --  on the use of Pat 's lightening rod . Being short on gray matter as well as on stature , he was n't getting it at all . " You mean , " he said for the third or thirty-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nag with this bat ? " " Heavens , no ! " gasped Pat , blanching . " It 's much too delicate for that . " " Do n't fool yourself , mister . Horses can stand a lot of leather . " " Not the horse , stupid , " I said . " The bat . This is the only riding crop of its kind in the world . We do n't want it damaged . All you have to do is carry it . We 'll do the rest . " " How about setting the dial , Don ? " asked Joyce . " Pat will do that just before the horses move onto the track . Now let 's get going . It 's weigh-in time . " We moved to the scales with our rider . He stepped aboard the platform , complete with silks and saddle , and the spinner leaped to a staggering 102 , whereupon the officials started gravely handing him little leather sacks . " What 's this ? " I whispered to Sandy . " Prizes for malnutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mississippi . " " The handicap , " she whispered back . " Lead weights at one pound each . " " If he starts to lose , " I ruminated , " they 'd make wonderful ammunition  --  " " One hundred and twenty-four , " announced the chief weigher-inner . " Next entry ! " We returned to Tapwater . The jockey fastened the weights to his gear , saddled up and mounted . From the track came the traditional bugle call . Sandy nodded to Pat . " All right , Pat . Now ! " Pending twisted the knob on his lightening rod and handed the stick to the jockey . The little horseman gasped , rose three inches in his stirrups , and almost let go of the baton . " H-hey ! " he exclaimed . " I feel funny . I feel  --  " " Never mind that , " I told him . " Just you hold on to that rod until the race is over . And when you come back , give it to Pat immediately . Understand ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " That 's because you 're featherbrained , " I advised him . " Now , get going . Giddyap , Dobbin ! " I patted Tapwater 's flank , and so help me Newton , I think that one gentle tap pushed the colt half way to the starting gate ! He pattered across the turf with a curious bouncing gait as if he were running on tiptoe . We hastened to our seats in the grandstand . " Did you get all the bets down ? " asked Joyce . I nodded and displayed a deck of ducats . " It may not have occurred to you , my sweet , " I announced gleefully , " but these pasteboards are transferrable on demand to rice and old shoes , the sweet strains of Oh , Promise Me ! and the scent of orange blossoms . You insisted I should have a nest egg before you would murmur , ' I do ' ? Well , after this race these tickets will be worth  --  " I cast a swift last glance at the tote board 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " approximately seventy thousand dollars ! " " Donald ! " gasped Joyce . " You did n't bet all your savings ? " " Every cent , " I told her cheerfully . " Why not ? " " But if something should go wrong ! If Tapwater should lose ! " " He wo n't . See what I mean ? " For even as we were talking , the bell jangled , the crowd roared , and the horses were off . Eight entries surged from the starting gate . And already one full length out in front pranced the weight-free , lightfoot Tapwater ! At the quarter post our colt had stretched his lead to three lengths , and I shouted in Pending 's ear , " How much does that jockey weigh , anyway ? " " About six pounds , " said Pat . " I turned the knob to cancel one eighteen . " At the half , all the other horses could glimpse of Tapwater was heels . At the three-quarter post he was so far ahead that the jockey must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a binocular view of his face , and he looked dazed and a little frightened . He was n't actually riding Tapwater . The colt was simply skimming home , and he was holding on for dear life to make sure he did n't blow off the horse 's back . The result was a foregone conclusion , of course . Tapwater crossed the finish line nine lengths ahead , setting a new track record . The crowd went wild . Over the hubbub I clutched Pat 's arm and bawled , " I 'll go collect our winnings . Hurry down to the track and swap that lightening rod for the real bat we brought along . He 'll have to weigh out again , you know . Scoot ! " The others vanished paddockward as I went for the big payoff . It was dreary at the totalizer windows . I was one of a scant handful who had bet on Tapwater , so it took no time at all to scoop into the valise I had brought along the seventy thousand bucks in crisp , green lettuce which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried back to join the others in the winner 's circle , where bedlam was not only reigning but pouring . Flashbulbs were popping all over the place , cameramen were screaming for just one more of the jockey , the owner , the fabulous Tapwater . The officials were vainly striving to quiet the tumult so they could award the prize . I found Pending worming his way out of the heart of the crowd . " Did you get it ? " I demanded . He nodded , thrust the knobbed baton into my hand . " You substituted the normal one ? " Again he nodded . Hastily I thrust the lightening rod out of sight into my valise , and we elbowed forward to share the triumphant moment . It was a great experience . I felt giddy with joy ; I was walking on little pink clouds of happiness . Security was mine at last . And Joyce , as well . " Ladies and gentlemen ! " cried the chief official . " Your attention , please ! Today we have witnessed a truly spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a champion racing under a tremendous handicap . I give you a magnificent racehorse  --  Tapwater ! " " That 's right , folks ! " I bawled , carried away by the excitement . " Give this little horse a great big hand ! " Setting the example , I laid down the bag , started clapping vigorously . From a distance I heard Pat Pending 's agonized scream . " Mr. Mallory  --  the suitcase ! Grab it ! " I glanced down , belatedly aware of the danger of theft . But too late . The bag had disappeared . " Hey ! " I yelled . " Who swiped my bag ? Police ! " " Up there , Mr. Mallory ! " bawled Pat . " Jump ! " I glanced skyward . Three feet above my head and rising swiftly was the valise in which I had cached not only our winnings but Pat 's gravity-defying rod ! I leaped  --  but in vain . I was still making feeble , futile efforts to make like the moon-hurdling nursery rhyme cow when quite a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jabbed me with a sedative ... * * * * * Later , when time and barbiturates had dulled the biting edge of my despair , we assembled once again in my office and I made my apologies to my friends . " It was all my fault , " I acknowledged . " I should have realized Pat had n't readjusted the rod when I placed it in my bag . It felt lighter . But I was so excited  --  " " It was my fault , " mourned Pat , " for not changing it immediately . But I was afraid someone might see me . " " Perhaps if we hired an airplane  --  ? " I suggested . Pat shook his head . " No , Mr. Mallory . The rod was set to cancel 118 pounds . The bag weighed less than twenty . It will go miles beyond the reach of any airplane before it settles into an orbit around earth . " " Well , there goes my dreamed-of fortune , " I said sadly . " Accompanied by the fading strains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is n't there one thing you folks are overlooking ? " asked Sandy Thomas . " My goodness , you 'd think we had lost our last cent just because that little old bag flew away ! " " For your information , " I told her , " that is precisely what happened to me . My entire bank account vanished into the wild blue yonder . And some of Pat 's money , too . " " But have you forgotten , " she insisted , " that we won the race ? Of course the track officials were a wee bit suspicious when your suitcase took off . But they could n't prove anything . So they paid me the Gold Stakes prize . If we split it four ways , we all make a nice little profit . " Or , " she added , " if you and Joyce want to make yours a double share , we could split it three ways . " Or , " she continued hopefully , " if Pat wants to , we could make two double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look in Pat 's eyes I knew he was stunned by this possibility . And from the look in hers , I felt she was going to make every effort to take advantage of his bewilderment . So , as I said before , what this country needs is a good cigar-shaped spaceship . There 's a fortune waiting somewhere out in space for the man who can go out there and claim it . Seventy thousand bucks in cold , hard cash . Indubitatiously !
