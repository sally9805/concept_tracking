Romeo and Juliet ( by William Shakespeare ; a Dwight Deere Wiman production ) seems Jess a play , to the world at large , than a great romantic legend . To the theater , it seems less a play than a part . No one produces it out of enthusiasm for its story alone . No one goes to see it because the Romeo is good , or stays home because he is n't . Everything centers on its not quite 14-year-old heroine ; for lady stars , Juliet is a final goal and often a graveyard . There is a double hazard : the part demands the maturest art , must convey the most dewy fragrance . <P> For Hollywood 's Olivia de Havilland Juliet was a gallant try but a double miss . She is neither a good enough actress nor a magical enough Juliet . She never seems to feel the part-only the importance of it . She never seems in love with Romeo-only with Romeo and Juliet . She recites poetry where she should radiate it ; and goes through the role as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . or pp . It is a thoroughly modest , painstaking performance , but it just never seems to matter . <P> Nor is the rest of the production particularly helpful . Douglas Watson 's Romeo is a little throaty and stagy . Though not the most tragic , Mercutio 's is the most unfortunate death in the play , since it comes early and removes the one really dashing character ( nicely played by Jack Hawkins ) . Thereafter , only true romantic intensity can save one of the least inevitable of tragedies from seeming one of the most protracted . The current production has a handsome but slightly heavy look , a slow and slightly heavy tread , and acting in every conceivable style .
