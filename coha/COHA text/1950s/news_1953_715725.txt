txt The country 's highest personages paid a last honor today in behalf of the United States to the Chief Justice , Fred M. Vinson , who died early Tuesday at the age of 63 . Two thousand men and women , not all of great station and many of them just plain people , attended a national memorial service in the Washington ( Protestant Episcopal ) Cathedral for Mr. Vinson . It was an hour both of parting and for the easing of old animosities such as " Mr. Fred " had done so often in life . Entering the great cathedral , that has been many years in the building , and where steel scaffolding still stands as construction // moves slowly toward the architect 's full design , President Eisenhower and his predecessor in , office , Harry Truman , met face to , ' face for the first Arne since Genpl eral nlisenhower 's inauguration last Jan. 20 .

The service itself was the Protestant Episcopal rite for the dead , though the Chief Justice was himself a Methodist , and it was conducted by the Bishop of Washington , the Right Rev.

It was held in the place where there have been many national scenes of mourning , and in the edifice where former President Woodrow Wilson now lies entombed . Burial Will Be in Kentucky Mr. Vinson 's body later was taken to Louisa , ley. , for burial tomorrow in his home town in a cemetery on a bluff above the Big Sandy River . Bishop Dun added one special prayer to the traditional Episcopal order in the Book of Common prayer : " Oh .

" In the congregation , a truly national cross section that had assembled at 2 P. M. under the high nave , were men of every faith and of none  --  the present great of the United States and those who had been powerful before in the old Democratic regimes* to which Mr. Vinson. himself . bad been a faithful adviser until the proprieties of the highest bench cut him off forever from politics .

They used to meet often in Mr. Rayburn 's little office in the Capitol . along about sundown . The talk . after Mr. Vinson had ascended the bench , was warm and personal and nostalgic . There was , in those days , nothing about the Presidency under Mr. Truman , nothing about the Supreme Court under Mr. Vinson , and nothing about the current affairs of the House of Representatives , in those days when Mr. Rayburn was the Speaker .

Many in the cathedral were from the old Roosevelt and Truman days  --  former Cabinet officers . old soldiers and admirals coming out of a long retirement ? as well as many figures from the new regime . President Eisenhower , who flew in from his vacation retreat in Colorado to attend the service , was joined by Vice President Nixon , by members of ins Cabinet and by dozens of the ranking diplomats in Washington . , Members of Congress , past and present . occupied a tier of pews at the back of the nave .

There will be a month of official mourning . In the cathedral , the body of the Chief Justice , in the black robes of his office , lay in a mahogany . coffin across which had been placed the heavy purple covering symbolizing death . The catafalque lay just beneath one of the Cathedral 's twin same pulpits , and a good distance from the high altar itself . There were flowers of subdued colors , seasonal with a day in Washington that was half summer and Ralf autumn , clear , crisp , yet a trifle hot . The organ set up low , slow tones twenty minutes or so before the service began .

Mr. Vinson 's favorite hymn " Abide With Me " ? was sung and it rang out loudly in the cathedral . ' All then said the Creed and the Bishop said a special and moving prayer for the Supreme Court in these words : " O righteous God , before whose throne shall be gathered all the nations , and whose word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart ; give , we pray Thee ; to the members of the Supreme Court of the United States , a wise and an understanding heart to judge Thy people , that they may discern between good and bad , ever walking before Thee in truth and in uprightness ; that so this nation may ? grow from age to age in obedience to Thy laws ; through Him who shall come to be - our judge , Thy son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the blessing and the recessional , the hymn , " The Strife Is O'er . " It was ended , then , and the cathedral began to empty . There had been no eulogy for the late Chief Justice ; it had been a service of simplicity and brevity . President Eisenhower , making his way out , directed that the usual custom , by which the President of the United States leaves any place alone , be set aside . He requested , instad , that the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court depart with him and in his party , and this they did . As the coffin was brought out from the cathedral the Associate Justices stood in parallel lines , their hats over their hearts . President Eisenhower and Mr. Nixon stood with them .
