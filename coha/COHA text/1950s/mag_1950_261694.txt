<P> When Teddy Roosevelt decided it was high time to put an end to the Russo-Japanese War and intervened in 1905 , * indignant citizens of Tokyo poured into the streets and burned down buildings to show their displeasure with the peace terms . Yukio Ozaki , then mayor of Tokyo , felt differently ; grateful for the U.S. mediation , he sent a thank-you gift of 2,000 Japanese cherry trees to the city of Washington in 1909 . When the trees reached the U.S. , however , the Department of Agriculture looked the gift trees in the bark and found they were heavily infested with the San Jose and the West Indian peach scale , Oriental moths , earwigs , and thrips . The Department had them destroyed . <P> Yukio Ozaki persisted . He had shoots taken from cherry trees near Tokyo and grafted on wild cherry roots . Set out in disinfected ground , the new trees grew pest-free and in 1911 Ozaki shipped 3,000 of them to Washington . This time the trees were found acceptable and planted along Washington 's Tidal Basin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countrymen have not been confined to the cherry tree incident . All his life Ozaki has been a democrat , pacifist and internationalist in a land primarily dominated by soldiers and all-out nationalists . Paradoxically , Ozaki 's heresies have won him wide respect and an unparalleled political career . Mayor of Tokyo for nine years and twice a cabinet minister , he was elected to the first Japanese Diet in 1890 and has been a member of every one since . Says his daughter , " Voting for father is a habit passed from one generation to another . It 's like a faith . " <P> Last week Yukio Ozaki was once more showing gratitude toward the U.S. Wispy but indomitable , he had flown the Pacific to thank Americans for their postwar aid . Brandishing a tulip-shaped ear trumpet , he told New York reporters , " If you think Japan is now becoming a democracy , you are mistaken . Japan is getting worse . . . " <P> Then Yukio Ozaki announced , " Americans have been wonderfully kind , but the Japanese do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them understand . " The comparative failure of his earlier efforts had not dimmed Ozaki 's interest nor killed his hope . " I am thinking , " the erect oldster said serenely , " of more distant , important visions in the world .
