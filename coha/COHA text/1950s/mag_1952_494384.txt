McCARTHY AND THE MINISTERS MCCARTHYISM has captured the majority , of Wisconsin 's clergymen . That is the inescapable conclusion drawn from a poll of the state 's ministers taken shortly before the September 9 primary by Paul Gustafson , church editor of the Milwaukee Sentinel . The poll was a postcard mailing to 250 clergymen of all denominations without regard to political affiliation . Four questions were asked : " Will Senator McCarthy win the primary ? " " Do you feel he should remain in office ? " " If victorious in the primary , what do you think his chances are in the November election ? " and " How do you feel personally about Senator McCarthy ? " One hundred and ninety-five clergymen answered the poll and 144 responded that they thought he would win the primary and the election . On the more important query : " Do you think he should be returned to the Senate ? " 134 answered " Yes , " 57 said " No , " and four were undecided . All but three expressed their personal Emil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were not asked to sign their names - but a number of them did so voluntarily . Seventy-five of the 134 who think McCarthy should be returned to the Senate are for him unequivocally . That is , they have no compunctions about his methods or his personal record . Of these 76 ministers who see no quarrel between McCarthy 's doctrine and their own , 48 stated they liked him for his " courage " and " fearlessness " without mentioning any specific issue . This singular point echoes the feeling of many observers of the recent primary that a major source of McCarthy 's strength lies not so much in his opposition to Communism as it does in his build-up as a " fighter . " As one minister put it in his comment , the people " need somebody to stir up the dust . " It was this appeal that was fostered also by the elder LaFollette . " Fighting Bob " has been replaced in Wisconsin politics by " Fighting Joe , " though one may wonder how the names of LaFollette and McCarthy could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Nixon Fund " was made public by the New York Post , the following . events had taken place : 1 . General Eisenhower said he believed his running-mate to be an " honest man . " He asked Nixon , who had issued a statement : that the story was a " typical left-wing smear , " for the facts that would convince the public he was " clean as a hound 's tooth . " . 2 . The Washington Post , the New York Herald Tribune and the two Richmond , Va. , papers ? all for Eisenhower ? called on Nixon to make a formal offer to withdraw . A New York Times survey of 100 repre sentative papers , the majority of which are Republican , showed disapproval of Nixon almost two to one . 3 . Nixon ordered Dana Smith to make public the full list of contributors-76 in all ? who had given the California Senator a total of $18,235 as " supplementary expenditures . " Close examination of the names bore out even more emphatically the pattern of interest groups described above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon 's benefactors came from groups campaigning for " free enterprise . " " Free enterprise " to this group meant abolition of price , rent and credit controls , an end to public housing and opposition to efforts to establish federal rights to off-shore oil lands . 4 . Top Republican leaders , headed by GOP Chairman Arthur Summerfield , lined up behind Nixon . However , the telegrams the General received were about 50-50 , or , as one reporter put it , " half to keep and half to cast . away . " 5 . While Governor Stevenson reserved judgment until a full disclosure of the fund could be made , Democratic Chairman Stephen Mitchell called on Nixon to resign . Sen. Robert S. Kerr ( D , Okla. ) suggested that the public set up a " Bundles-for-Nixon " campaign to take care of his current campaign expenses . Vice Presidential candidate John Sparkman recommended that the Hoey Permanent Investigating Subcommittee of the Senate Government Operations Committee investigate the secret fund . Nixon , one of the members of this subcommittee , has carried on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even pointed his menacing finger at the financial shenanigans of former Republican National Committee Chairman Guy Gabrielson along with Demo-cratic Chairman William 0 . Boyle and former Rep. Joseph Casey ( D , Mass. ) among others . His current plea for understanding and tolerance of his own financial activities is contrary to the very atmosphere he attempted to create in the investigations before his committee . Whether or not the Republican policy makers decide that Nixon 's fund is ethical , Congressional attention will be turned on the legality of " gift " contributions probably after the November election . Rep. Oakley Hunter ( R , Calif. ) attempted to take some of the heat off Nixon by admitting that about $4,000 was expended to him from a special expense allowance set up when he took office in January , 1951 . Several weeks ago a . similar $7,000 gift to Governor McKeldin ( R , Md. ) was returned to secret donors when former Sen. Millard Tydings demanded that the names of those who contributed ' be made public . While Congressional salaries have long been declared too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual sum alloted to Senators . Newsmen checking the salary and expenses given Nixon by the government pushed the total to approximately $70,000 . As a Senator Nixon is given a special cash fund for stationery , airmail and special delivery stamps , long-distance telephone calls and telegrams . He is allowed 20-cents-a-mile travel expenses to and from each session of Congress . His office space and all the furniture , in Washington is free . He has free franking of all " official business " correspondence , and he is even entitled to free haircuts and shaves in the Senate barber shop . In the September 6 , 1952 , issue of the . Saturday Evening Post , Patricia Nixon tells about the start ' of her husband 's rise in her own words : " We 've been broke ? so broke that I wept because at a critical moment there was n't any money to buy stamps to mail campaign literature for which we had paid dearly . " That was when Nixon began his political career six years ago . But he has since made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stationery , printing , mimeographing and supplies ; $3,430.78 for travel and hotel expenses ; $2,017.79 for radio and TV expenses , etc . Mrs. Nixon goes on to tell that since Dick has been in Congress , " We have never done much entertaining in Washington because a Senator 's salary , which is all we have , runs out amazingly fast . " ( Italics ours ) . The combined total of Dana Smith 's " little fund " and the Senator 's legitimate allowance from the government averaged $79,000 per year . When the selection of a Vice-President came up in the Republican convention , Patricia Nixon confides to Post readers these heartfelt words of her husband 's : " If they feel I 'm the one who can help the ticket the most , I feel I should accept . I want to see the party win with Ike . Then I 'd feel I had helped to do something that has been my purpose since I went into politics . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
