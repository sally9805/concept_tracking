The casual European who puts his glass to his eye is likely to identify the U.S. today as a sort of gigantic liner on a luxury cruise . She sails serenely into the atomic age , with a rich mixture of smoke pouring from her stacks . Her paint and brightwork are spick-and-span . Lights burn brightly from every porthole , and occasional snatches of music float out . Her passengers , sports-dressed and bullion-blessed , spend seemingly endless hours on deck playing shuffleboard . <P> But the nature of the problems that concerned the U.S. last week proved that this is a very different kind of craft . In Washington , the U.S. Supreme Court implemented its bold decree against segregation in public schools with a flexible and practical plan for carrying out a social revolution through a form of legal evolution . This was no luxury-liner decision : it promised a generation of litigation , a continual nagging at the conscience and the legal ingenuity of the land until the change was completed . In Detroit , having rejected an offer of stock ownership in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won a concession to the principle of the guaranteed annual wage . Strike or no strike , the hard give-and-take of bargaining had lifted the autoworkers toward a new and more secure place in the U.S. 's fourth-ranking industry . Every thoughtful American knew that G.A.W. , like desegregation , promised plenty of trouble in the years ahead , when it would be applied to more and more industrial situations . <P> But the prospect of that kind of trouble did not cause the U.S. to alter its course of rapid social change . Far from being in these days of increasing prosperity a relaxed luxury liner drifting through seas of self-satisfaction , the U.S. is , more than ever , on a cruise of experiment , an amazing and perilous voyage of discovery toward the unknown potentialities of brotherhood that may lie beyond mere material prosperity .
