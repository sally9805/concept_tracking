Britain was glad to make a deal for aluminum which the aluminum-short U.S. had turned down . Under an agreement made last week with the Aluminum Co. of Canada , Ltd. , Britain , already importing 150,000 tons a year , will be assured of that supply , plus an additional 50,000 tons annually for 20 years . <P> Alcan had offered to sell the U.S. Government 200,000 tons in the next three years at 16 a lb. , 1 below the U.S. domestic price . But U.S. producers protested so loudly that NSRB Boss Stuart Symington turned down the deal . U.S. producers declared that they could supply all the aluminum the Government needs , if given time and money to expand . Meanwhile , NPA has ordered a 35% cut for civilian use of aluminum by March .
