Middle of the Night ( Sudan ; Columbia ) transforms an honest but clumsy play by Paddy Chayefsky into a cruelly beautiful and moving film , a story of life and love as a man grows older . The man ( Fredric March ) is a clothing manufacturer-shrewd , hardworking , decent . At 56 , still " a vigorous man with normal appetites , " still fairly attractive to women , he finds himself a widower . What to do with the rest of his life ? At first he simply works , works , works . After a while he starts spending time at his married daughter 's house , playing with the baby . Then one day his pretty , 24-year-old receptionist ( Kim Novak ) , a nice , mixed-up kid whose marriage has recently gone on the rocks , takes a fit of hysterics , and the boss decides to give her a little fatherly attention . <P> His attention soon takes a different turn . He finds himself hanging around the neighborhood she lives in , waiting like a schoolboy for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he warns himself . " What are you doing ? " One night he gets up enough courage to ask her for a date . After three or four of them , he knows he has it bad . She knows it , too , and tries to break off the affair before things go too far . But she needs to be loved as much as he needs to love . <P> Soon he begins to tell himself that he wants desperately to marry her . " I do n't want to be a middle-aged man keeping a girl somewhere . " But he is old enough to know it would never work out . And then again : " Is it fair to have children at my age ? " What 's more , he is aware that the girl really wants a father more than she wants a lover . Every counsel of experience and common sense requires that he let her go-so he asks her to marry him . And she accepts . <P> The trouble begins at about that point . Secretly , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is not at all sure what love is . And he runs into a hornet 's nest at home . His sister , who has kept house for him since the death of his wife , sobs bitterly : " My whole life , my whole life I gave up ! " And his book-smart daughter , blissfully unaware of her own father fixation , sweetly explains to him why his behavior is " neurotic . " <P> He refuses to listen to reason from anyone ; but he can not entirely ignore the warning voice of fear . Does he really love the girl ? Does he , at his age , really want to live the emotional life of a young man ? Would n't he be wiser to act his age and somehow find his peace ? In the happy-unhappy ending , the victim-hero of the drama accepts at life 's hands the lesser evil , the larger hope .
