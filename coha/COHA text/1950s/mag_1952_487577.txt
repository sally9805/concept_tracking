NO LABOR leader can deliver the vote , " said Walter Reuther when he was consulted by the platform-drafting committee of the Democratic Party . The man who has since been elected president of the C. 1 . 0 . continued : " If any labor leader says he can deliver the labor vote he is kidding you or himself . He can influence and try to mobilize his people around issues , and they will deliver the vote . " The election results bore out this statement , showing clearly that indorsement by the heads of labor does not guarantee a victory at the polls . On the other hand , careful analysis of the returns from industrial areas discovers no mass defections of workers from the Democratic Party . In such strongly organized urban areas as the counties embracing Cleveland , Youngstown , Canton , and Akron in Ohio , and Detroit , Flint , and Grand Rapids in Michigan , Governor Stevenson ran better than President Truman did four years ago . Many top labor leaders wonder , however , how large a proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently when he was asked how he felt about the union 's political activities . " I do n't want the union or anybody else to tell me how to vote , " he said . " It 's my constitutional right to vote as I see fit . I do n't even tell my wife how to vote . The union should stay out of politics -- absolutely . They have enough trouble in the shop without taking on politics . " The effectiveness of labor 's political program in the recent election campaign will be debated for months . In the meantime , let us take a look at what officers and members thought about union political action during the spring and summer of 1952 . In the course of a research project carried out at the Industrial Relations Center of the University of Chicago , we discussed the subject with more than a thousand trade-unionists . We sampled steel workers , oil workers , coal miners , automobile workA . A. LIVERIGHT is director of the Union Education Center at the University of Chicago . BERNARD KARSH is a research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ers , and garment workers . We talked at length with union officers . Our conclusions can be summarized as follows : 1 . Local union officers and the small core of active members are unconditionally in favor of union political action ; the majority of inactive members are split between all-out and qualified support . However , in some locals as many as a third of the rank and file are categorically opposed to any union political activity . 2 . Both leaders and rank and file feel strongly that the union should provide them with honest , complete data on the record of candidates and the issues of the election , but they hold to their right to vote according to their own conscience . 3 . The leaders generally recognize that political action by the union is an extension of the collective-bargaining function , that what is won around the conference table can be lost in Washington . The average member , with reservations about political action to begin with , has a more limited perspective . He has seen how community political action can neutralize the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his own city , but he feels that the collective-bargaining arm of the union ends just outside the plant gates . 4 . Both rank-and-file members and local officers resent having political issues oversimplified . They do n't like hearing the Taft-Hartley act called a " slave-labor " law when it has not as yet made slaves of them . They suspect any approach which would drive them into a certain position . 5 . Almost half of the union officers questioned thought that labor " rides the tail of the Democratic kite " and has little part in indorsing individual candidates in either party . Fully half of the inactives in one local , when asked for their views on P. A. C. ( the C. I. 0 . ' s Political Action Committee ) , responded with variations of " What 's P. A. C. ? or even " Who 's he ? " When the idea was explained to them , not many were sympathetic . Local union leaders in attendance at a labor institute last summer were asked to- indicate on a questionnaire which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding whom to vote for . Only 9 of 123 reported that they would follow strictly the indorsement of their union 's political organization . 6 . Almost all the officers queried and a large majority of the members , both active and inactive , seemed to feel that the welfare of the workers was best safeguarded by the Democratic Party  --  when it has good candidates . 7 . Union members are interested in broad national issues  --  not just in labor legislation . A poll of union members taken before the recent election showed that the majority believed foreign policy , taxes , inflation , and civil rights to be the most important issues . Repeal of Taft-Hartley came next ; communism in the United States was placed last on the list . P ROBABLY the chief reason for labor 's lack of interest in political action is the defective system of education and communication within the union . The union meeting is never well attended nowadays except at a time of crisis . It served a real purpose during the turbulent late 30 's when the modern labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists . The period of Organization in the mass-production industries is all but completed . In the old days the union hall provided a place where workers met and talked about the hardships of the depression and the open shop . Now they have other opportunities for social contact ; mass media of communication have been greatly developed ; a grievance committee handles in-shop problems , The membership is generally pretty well satisfied with the union 's accomplishments . Most local leaders have as yet failed to devise more effective methods for keeping the members informed of the union 's purposes . Many feel that if the members wo n't come to the meetings ; it is their own fault : " let them stew in their ignorance . " Of course this is exactly what happens , and so the membership seldom learns the value of concerted political action . Another reason for theirapparent indifference is their traditional reverence for the secret ballot . Like all Americans , union members want to make up their own minds and not be told whom to vote for . An automobile worker whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should definitely engage in political activity , but it should n't tell me to vote for John Jones because he 's a union man . Let it tell me about the candidates and what they stand for and I 'll vote for the one I think is the best man . " Though an increasing number of union members identify their interests with those of the Democratic Party , there are still some good Republicans among them , and these resent what seems like labor 's blanket indorsement of Democratic policies . They feel that labor 's political activity is forcing them into the position of either renouncing their own views or being considered disloyal members . Many unionists , as well as other citizens , thinkof politics and political action as something dishonest , They feel that active participation in politics is much more likely to corrupt the union than to dean up politics , that labor is not so much influencing the result as being used by politicians for their own ends . They look with distrust upon national labor leaders who become the pals of top politicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of why political action is an increasingly ' important and time-consuming activity of their leaders , some unions accuse their top officers of being more interested in their new national prestige than in labor 's real . problems . Unions also have a tremendous number of members who were brought in through **25;1268;TOOLONG and union-shop provisions and in consequence are " organized " but not " unionized . " These " card-carriers " do not realize what conditions were like before the union was formed . Not knowing the score on regular union matters  --  either because the union has done a poor educational job or because the employer has done an effective one  --  they naturally do n't know the score on political action and resent attempts to influence them more than do the older members . While the political-action program of neither the A. F. of L. nor the C. I. 0 . has made a deep impression on the rank and file , probably more union members went to the polls this year than ever before . The constant emphasis on politics at union meetings , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made labor aware of the importance of political action . Marked progress has been made , but much still needs to be done . The collective-bargaining process is increasingly influenced by political decisions in which organized labor should take part . The most challenging task is to educate the rank and file on the relationship between political action and their own welfare . The first step in this necessary educational job was taken shortly before the election when C. I. 0. -P . A. C. launched a number of educational institutes whose purpose was to instruct local union heads on why unions should be in politics , not on how to finance their programs and Induce people to register . But educational institutes which function only in the few months preceding a national election are not enough . A year-round , long-range " Labor and Politics " educational program is called for , focused on the fact that labor has a vital interest in political developments and aimed at the inactive members in the shop . Our post-election discussions with A. F. of L , and C. I. 0 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago show that since the election they are in favor of more political action  --  not less . They insist , however , that the labor leaders must change their methods if they hope to persuade the rank and file . And in this they are supported by the thousands of other union officers and members who have filled out our questionnaires on the best way to stimulate participation by labor in politics . The suggestions offered can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) Don't.tell us what to do ; give us the facts and we 'll make up our own minds . ( 2 ) Do n't tell us to ring doorbells until we are convinced that it is important to ring them . ( 3 ) If unions are going to indorse candidates , give us some part in deciding whom they will indorse. ( 4 ) Though the Democratic Party is friendly to us , do n't commit us to it so definitely that we can not influence it , and do n't forget that some good Republicans are on our side . ( 5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're poor union men if we do n't give it . Let us know how the buck will help us and our families
