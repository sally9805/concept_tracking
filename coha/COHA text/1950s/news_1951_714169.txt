txt The Government is preparing to use a big new inducement to coax oil companies to expand their output of aviation gasoline . The Defense Department will announce the plan within the next few days . If the device works on aviation gasoline ? and no one here doubts that it will  --  it may be used next on aluminum producers . From there it could spread to a host of other defense-needed coniuiodities . Federal lawyers say their new plan is a last-ditch effort to keep the Government from having to build its own plants , which it can do under the Defense Production Act . " If the plan works on alkylate. " says a Federal official working out the contract 's final details , " we may also use it for other commodities needed for the ? defense effort , like alulninum or just about anything else the Government had to build its own plants to get during World War II . " Government 's Guarantee The latest lure is known as a " facilities contract . " It amounts to a Government promise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment . It 's by far the biggest inducement yet prepared by the mobilization planners to get defense-needed expansion . Until now , the Federal men  --  though they 've been mighty generous  --  have shied away from such sweeping guarantees . The most they have been willing to offer private firms putting up extra production facilities U. RS one or a comliination of the following aids : A Federal loan to finance the expansion or Government backing for a private loan ; a purchase contract , help in getting scarce materials and special tax benefits . Now , the Government production men are groomirrg- their new no-loss promise to use on oil companies . With it . they hope to get something they 've been pushing for but have failed to get up to now : A 25e- boost by 1954 in the nation 's capacity to turn out alicylate , the ingredient that gives aviation gasoline its extra kick . Present alkylate capacity : 127,000 barrels a day . Objective : . 158,000 barrels a day . The oil men are likely to be veryFeceptive to the plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary talks with a half-dozen of them and none raised any basic objections to the idea . " The " idea " is exUemely complex . " Even our own staff does n't fully understand it yet , " a Federal oil official declares . In general , however , the Government agrees to buy the output of the new plants until the investment is paid off  --  or make good the part that is n't paid off . Here 's how it would work : The oil companies would put up their own money  --  about $82 million  --  to rehabilitate the five Federal plants and build about 26 new ones . Then the Defense Department would sign up for a year 's worth of each plant 's output at prices that would permit the plant to earn back its normal depreciation plus a " reasonable profit " ( which the Federal men figure at " about 5.2% " ) . The department would keep on signing these contracts , year-by-year , for at least five years . Officials say they would n't want to sign contracts running over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such quantities that long . " But if the Government quits buying the alkylate before the five years are up , it has to do one of two things : Either end the " facilities contract " by paying the company a lump sum to match its unreturned investment or else put the plant on " stand by . " If the plant is put on " stand by . " Uncle Sam kicks in the maintenance cost plus the eaorrnal depreciation charge of the plant ( usually 10% a year for alkylate facilities I. After Five-Year Period After the plant has been operating  --  or on " stand by " ? for a total of five years , the plant owner is called upon to make a decision : Does he want to keep the plant going as a comnaercial venture or does n't he ? If he doesn't. the Government will give him back his unreturned investment at the time less the salvage value of the plant 's equipment . If he does , the Government men will sit down with him and haggle over the value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam would kick in the difference between the unreturned investment and that value . if there is any . If the value is greater than the unreturned investment , no one pays anybody anything . In either case , the alkylate man ends up owning the plant . Reasons for Boosting Capacity Military men want the extra 31.000 barrels of alkylate producing capacity because ' finer fuels required by the newest propeller aircraft have halved the producing ability of existing World War U plants . Also , larger and faster planes burn much more gas to go the same distance than did their World War II counterparts . Store aviation gasoline is needed , too , to power the airlift to Korea and train more flyers for the rapidly-expanding Air Force . Final touches are being put on the no-loss plan now by officials of the Defense Department and the Petroleum Administration for Defense . It was their joint idea . ' The U'Vci agencies have asked Congress for S85 million so they can make their promise to the alkylate people . They want $7 million of that to back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War IIbuilt plants . The rest is to get private companies to build about 26 new plants of their own . Those 31 plants , the Government figures . could turn out the needed 31,000 additional barrels of alkylate needed daily . State of Appropriations Already , Congress " has provided the ST million needed to reactivate the five Government plants . Since then , the House has approved  --  and the Senate is expected soon to okay  --  another $75 million for the new plants .
