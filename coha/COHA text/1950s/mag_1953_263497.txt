Only a month after the Administration put its new hard-money policy into effect , cries of doom and disaster welled up , most of them from predictable quarters . C.I.O. and A.F.L. spokesmen expressed fears that the new policy would set off a recession . A group of 19 Fair Deal Congressmen introduced a resolution demanding that the Federal Reserve Board start pegging the price of Government bonds again . Farmers , they said , were having trouble getting support loans ; industries had trouble financing expansion , and veterans were having a tough time getting mortgage loans . <P> There was no doubt that credit was tighter . New York and Chicago banks had far more requests for loans than they could fill . But they could not boost their own credit base by selling Government bonds because the FRB refused to buy in the open market . As a result , all Government bonds fell below par , and no bank wanted to sell at a loss . <P> According to Plan . But this was all according to plan . Instead of being discouraged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 20 years , FRB Chairman William McChesney Martin , strategist of the credit-tightening , was encouraged . He reported that " free riders , " the speculators who had bought the newest bonds on credit in hopes of unloading at a quick profit when they soared well above par , had lost their shirts as a result of the drop . In fact , much of the weakness in bonds was due to their frantic unloading . Martin , ready to resume buying and loosen up credit any time there were real signs that the tightening would bring a recession , last week made a token gesture by buying $45 million worth of Treasury bills . <P> Nobody could find many signs of recession . Actually , credit of all kinds is still on the rise . Consumer credit alone has risen $5 billion in a year ( to $25.7 billion ) , one-third of it in auto installment purchases . <P> Credit is short now because the FRB has been holding the line , and demands for it are still increasing . <P> What Is Prosperity ? Most other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New building construction is running 10% ahead of 1952 's . <P> The steel industry , which has turned out a record 38.5 million tons in four months , sees few signs of a letup in demand . Industrial production stood last week at 242 on the FRB 's index ; in 1953-3 first quarter , the gross national product ( sum of the value of all goods &; services ) reached an annual rate of $361 billion v. 1952 's $346 billion . Personal income hit a new record of $281 billion , up 5% in the quarter . <P> With justified sarcasm , the father of the hard-money program , Treasury 's Deputy Secretary W. Randolph Burgess , last week asked : " If that is depression , what would prosperity be ? The fact is the danger of inflation still exists . "
