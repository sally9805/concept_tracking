THE Vicious CIRCLE ( 310 pp. ) - Margaret Case Harriman , illustrated by Al Hirschfeld-Rlnehart ( $3 ) . <P> <P> She was an innkeeper 's daughter , and none of the big shots dazzled her . To little Margaret Case , the celebrities who hung around father Frank Case 's celebrated Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan were just a lot of gabby customers . Doug Fairbanks Sr. , who had just made his first picture , was a real pal and used to skip rope with her on the roof . But the bunch that ate lunch together almost every day , at a round table in the Rose Room , had little time for her ; they were too busy trying to top each other 's wisecracks . <P> They called themselves the Vicious Circle , and one day as they trooped out after lunch-Robert Sherwood , Dorothy Parker , George Kaufman , Bob Benchley , Heywood Broun and the rest-a pressagent paid them his passing respects . " There , " said he , " goes the greatest collection of unsalable wit in America . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own prices . <P> Who Said It ? Margaret Case Harriman has culled the anecdotage about the Round Table , sifted her own recollections , and bound it all into a lively book . The Vicious Circle is neither weighty nor frowningly significant , but it is about people who were intensely and hilariously alive , many of them brilliant , most of them naturals . <P> Author Harriman says the Round Table was formed by accident and mutual attraction in 1920 . It was an informal company , but one that no one dreamed of trying to crash . The charter members-including Alexander Woollcott , Harold Ross , George Kaufman and Edna Ferber - had violent dislikes that kept membership low and bores off bounds . <P> Besides sustenance , the lunches were meant to provide bright talk and character assassinations , and the hero of the day was the man with the fastest comeback . The circle also respetted good writing . Among young U.S. writers of the ' 20s and ' 30s , acceptance at the Round Table was an accolade second only to a publisher 's acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown even in the early days of the Round Table . Everybody read F.P.A. 's " Conning Tower " in the Tribune ; Deems Taylor was the World 's bright young music critic ; George Kaufman was the influential drama editor of the Times ; Harold Ross , editor of the American Legion Weekly , was soon to embark on his New Yorker venture ; and Dorothy Parker was living , as usual , on the edge of disaster-she had just lost her drama critic 's job at Vanity Fair* ( at Showman Florenz Ziegfeld 's request because Dottie had roasted Mrs. Ziegfeld , alias Billie Burke ) . <P> The Vicious Circle 's gags ran from harmless to vicious . Dorothy Parker , who once hung up the sign MEN on her office door because she was lonely , was also one of the champion acid-throwers . Said she to a lady writer who bragged about holding her husband for seven years : " Do n't worry , if you keep him long enough he 'll come back in style . " Franklin P. Adams was generally somewhat kinder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobogganing over the weekend , F.P.A. replied : " Well , you know how he looks NOT tobogganing. "
