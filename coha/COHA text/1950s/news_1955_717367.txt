txt The stupid and illegal attempts of the leaders of the International Longshoremen 's Association to fight the Waterfront Commission by direct action on the docks have made a dispassionate appraisal of the commission 's functions and opera : tions both difficult and dangerous . It is difficult because of the bitter antagonisms the strike stirred up : dangerous because , by now , any criticisms of the commission may seem to some to be an endorsement of the I. L. A. 's conduct or an effort to undermine the commission 's authority  --  with neither of which we have the slightest sympathy . But , in spite of these risks , we still believe a thorough and objective review of the whole situation is badly needed . In the first place the Bi-State Compact , under which the commission operates , was hastily drawn and enacted in an extreme emergency ? the total breakdown of law and morals on the waterfront so starkly revealed by the Crime Commission 's findings . Every human institution , even those more deliberately conceived , can be improved upon . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of good . It is especially needed in a case like this where a government agency has been given certain powers , in the interest of law ' and order which do some violence to the principles of . a free democracy . Only such an emergency could justify the limits now imposed by . the compact on the freedom of the employers and employes themselves to determine the conditions of employment on the waterfront : Then , too , some serious questions about the commission 's operations have emerged from the fog of recent controversy , in spite of the union 's failure up to now to state its case . Unfortunately , the I. L. A. 's resort to force against the commission has made it impossible , so far , for the Governors of New York and New Jersey to provide for the kind of impartial appraisal that is so badly needed . The Citizens Waterfront Committee ? the recruitment of which was the gimmick by which the strike was called off  --  will act primarily as a sounding board for L L. A. complaints . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given a fair field to prove it can . Louis Waldman 's acceptance of the union 's invitation to prepare and present its case to the committee , and the " free hand " he has been guaranteed , give grounds to believe that the long-awaited bill of particulars will now be forthcoming . Considering the circumstances of Its recruitment , the committee is far front the ideal panel to pass judgment on the union 's grievances , but at least they Will now be stated in an orderly way . The Waterfront Commission , the two State Legislatures and the public will then have a chance to draw their own conclusions . Any suggestion from the union designed to weaken the commission in attaining its objectives should be as strenuously opposed asthose ' designed to make it more effective should be supported . Also , we hope that the union will not confine itself to airing its grievances against the commission , but will make constructive suggestions as to . how labor conditions on the waterfront can be improved and stabilized.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
