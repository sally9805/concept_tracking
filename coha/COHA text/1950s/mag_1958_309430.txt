Into East Berlin to help celebrate a Communist " Book Week " came a Stalin Prizewinning Russian novelist . But he did not stop there . He walked straight through the Brandenburg Gate and claimed refuge in the West . Aleksandr Nikolaevich Cheishvili , 55 , won a Stalin Prize in 1951 for a drearily-written novel called Lelo , which told how boy and girl , after quarreling , got reunited by working together to overfill their production quotas on a collectivized Georgian tea farm . <P> Cheishvili was by all odds the strangest Soviet defector to fly West in a long time . A thick-lipped , bushy-browed , literary mountain lion who sported a flowing silk tie , Author Cheishvili condemned " the intellectual intolerance in my country , " and said that the " socialist realism " Moscow expected of its authors " made me sick . " But in the next breath he defended " with pride the many great things our government has done since Stalin 's death . " Why , then , had he left his wife and two sons in Tiflis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he boomed , " in helping foster coexistence between East and West . I am going to be a bridge across the gap in mutual understanding between our countries . " <P> Interviewing officials did not know whether to consider him a self-appointed , Rudolf Hess-like emissary from the East , a Soviet propagandist or a crazy mixed-up author . They finally decided to let him stay .
