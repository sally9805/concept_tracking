Latin America , currently buying from the U.S. at a $3.1 billion-a-year clip , is paying for its purchases with exemplary promptness . Last week the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that in March the current draft indebtedness of Latin importers of U.S. goods fell to a nominal $99.9 million . In the seven years that the bank has kept records , that figure was matched only once before : in the Korean war month of September 1950 . It was the eleventh successive monthly decline in such commercial arrears , which now amount to about a third of the total outstanding a year ago . Basic reason for Latin America 's improved cash position in U.S. trade : the coffee boom .
