A S dawn broke over the Florida Everglades one morning last May . two weird vehicles stood idling at its upper end , their radiators pointed south into its heart . I sat on the buckboard seat of one and reflected the junket on which we were about to embark offered the Miami papers the best opportunity since their founding to headline a real **32;4207;TOOLONG story . The fantastic marshy wilderness called the Everglades begins at Lake Okeechobee , a conspicuous body of fresh water somewhat more than halfway down the peninsula , and winds up more than 100 miles to the south , where the peninsula dips into the Gulf of Mexico . Only once before , in 1883 , when Miami was nonexistent , had white men gone down the center from the lake to the Gulf . They fought their way through it in canoes for twenty-six days Bud Popenhager said we could do it in three days . A lean man with a faraway look in his eyes , Bud has been poking around the ' Glades for the laist twenty of his thirty-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have led him to the racing pits at Indianapolis . Instead , he built some of the abided of these quaint , mechanized buckboards called ' Glades buggies and went on where the tracks of others stopped . If Bud said so , it might be possible . It was worth trying because even in modern timtei hardly anyone sees the interior of the ' Glades . Ever since the Seminoles thumbed their noses at brigades of United States troops from its depths , the Everglade has worn a cloak of mystery and impenetrability . People drive across it on the Tamiami Trail from Miami every day , yet few would leave their cars to venture into it afoot for any considera 9 tion . Most have an unshakable belief that the center is crawling with snakes and alligators . A few hunters make forays along the fringes in the dry season . Froggers in airboats  --  shallow-draft craft driven by airplane propellers  --  work the more , accessible sloughs in the wet season . But even to this venturesome handful , the vastness of the ' Glades is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One feels a foot , another the tail , another the trunk . No one sees the elephant . If we could make it from the lake to the Gulf , we should get a pretty good squint at the animal . The buggies stood now at the logical jumping-off point , the end of a low muck dike a half-dozen miles below Lake Okeechobee . Behind us lay a strip of rich black fields through which we 'd come from the lakeside town of South Bay . These were once part of the ' Glades , but had now been drained . The pumps we passed on the dike protected them from the rise and fall of water on the ' Glades . Ahead of the buggies to the south lay one of the strangest sights in North America  --  a rippling green sea of saw grass that stretched away until it merged with the hot blue sky at the horizon . This was the true Everglades  --  not a dismal swamp or a jungle , but an open solitude of saw grass , the greatest concentration of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were mysterious refuges known only to the Seminoles . Ninety miles south down the saw grass lay our goal , a labyrinth of mangrove-lined creeks where the fresh water off the ' Glades met the salt .

One convict jumped off his Brahma to the safety of the ground , only to be charged by two other goring hulls ; so he grabbed frantically for the brick of the hell he had just left .

This mad scramble is a warm-up for two hours of unehirted violence . Director Moore has learned , in years of this rough stuff , that the spectators enjoy convict opals as much as they do an expert , ride ; so , as far as the success of the show is concerned , it makes no difference whether a rider comes sailing off at the first jump or sticks for t he full eight seconds . The mimes , numbers , home towns and sentences of all the performers are printed on the program . along with the sometimes significant names of the horses . And one of the lesser pastimes is checking the length of the term being served by the convict who tries his luck on a horse named Lifer . This time Lifer emerged with one of the best Negro riders in the rodeo , Elliott Harvey . He stuci. -o the brute until the whistle sounded , by which time eight long seconds of his fifty-year term for murder had passed .

Leading this unharnessed life , the animals get meaner and last longer than the stock of outside rodeos . Except for Black Bottom , the two most dreaded bronco in the prison remuda are Nemo and Red Wasp , although both are past twenty years old and have been in the prison longer than any of the riders . The crowd likes certain horses and yells for them , especially Strawberry Roan and Black Bottom . I RODE WITH THE GLADES BUGGIES Genii tttttttt from Page 16 ) To keep us company , Bud had invited friends and another buggy . As he stood up to read his compass and set a course , l looked the party over . It would have been hard to convince a movie-goer that this hunch knew anything about the Everglades  --  no snake boots , no machetes , no guns , no Seminole guide . But they were all active members of an Everglades coneervation club organized by Popenhager . DeWitt Ramsey , a vigorous old-timer who could remember when panthers howled hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exact duplicate of Bud 's except for the parasol top . " Riding first class , " DeWitt called it . With him rode Dick Hoene , whose little buggy had been garaged in spite of his indignant protests that it could make the trip , and Bill Piper , who operat  --  s a zoological garden featuring Everglades wildlife . Strawberry came twisting out with Fred Turley , a burglar , aboard . roan mite in the emit end come down in the weal rind spent very little time on the ground , but with what looked like Cure will power , Fred stayed on until Strawberry was halfway across the arena . Black Bottom resembled greased lightning when he thundered out of the chute . We Willie vied with h ill his : night , but In coultle'l cut the mustard . Black Bottom threw him en high that the birds had time to build a nest in his shirt pocket before he hit the ground , and announcer Roy Dillon warned , " Look out there , lioy ! You 're not allowed to go over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A snorting bay horse tossed a robber on the first jump , but the rider 's foot caught in the stirrup and he was dragged along the fence by t he kicking horse . The pickup men finally released him . " Poor fellow , " moaned Dillon . apparently knowing that the man was n't badly hurt , " and he had just twenty-nine more days to serve  --  Christmas dive , that is . " All the way it is good-natured , fun-poking , clowning . And it is also rough and tough , almost murderous , but that 's the way the convicts ? the riders and the watchers  --  want it ; it is a way of letting of steam . In the final performance of the 1952 four-Sunday thriller . Snuffy Garrett 's clowning turned into near tragedy . In an event known as the chariot race  --  a Brahma bull hitched to a two-wheeled cart racing with other hulls likewise fettered  --  Snuffy was n't quick enough , and a chariot overturned on him . He had to be hospitalized . The wonder is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far there have been few serious injuries and no fatalities . The money the rodeo brings in fixes up many times more convicts who come to prison in had repair than the number who ever get hurt in the show . In 1952 , 1000 convicts were provided with glasses from the hard-riding money , while 160 others got their glasses repaired ; 747 men got full sets of false teeth , 198 received partial dentures and 70 had their plates repaired . Raymond Cameron , a bull rider who is doing twenty years for murder , was one With Bud and me rode Ray Barnes , a veteran state wildlife officer . As our saw-grass safari prepared to push off , he remarked that while he had the greatest confidence in Bud 's navigation , the game-department plane would be on the looknu t for two b uggissi runn ing in circles in the middle of the ' Glades . Bud gave him a grin , pocketed the compass and nosed the buggy off the dike . It was promptly submerged in a sea of greenery from which only our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east mile , But it was mixed with the dry , seven-foot stems of a towering weed called dog fennel . This stuff popped and poured hack in a steady shower . It was like sitting behind a power lawn mower going through a length of picket fence . It was a relief when we came out into a solid mass of tall saw grass , broken occasionally by clumps of willow . The buggies chewed into it at the pace of a man running , rolling the tough , sharp-edged stalks down with their iron-pipe bumpers and flattening them under the eight driving wheels . It was a noisy process . As the country grew wetter a steady mist rose from the wheels . who got partial dentures ; at the rodeo last year a bouncing Brahma scattered four of Rayne-m ( 1 ' 14 front teeth in the arena . During this prod year , five convicts got hearing aids , and seven are walking around on artificial legs supplied by rodeo money , Ten men got glare eyes during the year . The State provide/4 no money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hristmns the convicts sit down to turkey dinners which are paid for by the rodeo . Because of t lie fat rodeo fund , A. C. Turner , the director of rehabilitation , was able to huy $30,01.10 worth of motion-picture equipment in 1952 . The convicts in every unit of the prison system are at least one current movie a week , with several religious films each month . During the cotton season , the pickers could forget aching backs and atickered fingers while enjoying popular movies two evenings a week . Turner also bought $10,000 worth of baseball equipment , and each unit has its own team in the Prison League , which winds up the season with the " Inside-World Series . " There 's a good library , kept current with bootie , magazines and newspapers , at each unit , and Turner 's department is considering the possibility of installing television mete . One of the busiest places behind the walls at I I urasv il le is the Piddlin ' Shop , which is also financed by rodeo money . Here the convicts , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday , can learn crafts such as wood , leather and metal work . They huy their own materials and make purses , saddles . boots , rings and souvenirs , which they sell , mainly to the throngs coming to the rodeo . I saw the man who had ridden Strawberry Roan , Fred Turley , an the Piddlin ' Shop . He was lacing leather thongs with both hands . making a $150 saddle  --  a trade he learned in the shop . Fred had only two more months in prison . From the sale of articles he had made on his own free time , he had saved $1500 in Government bonds . He had his choice of three jobs in the leather industry . " I 've ridden in nine rodeos here , " Fred said , " but I 'm through . I 'm going to stay outside and make saddles to go on horses ' backs . " We were in for a hot day . The saw grass choked off the breeze down on the buggy seat . Bud moved up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . I realized he might as well . The buggy had a hand throttle on the steering post . but neither a foot accelerator nor a brake pedal . Brakes would be superfluous weight . Let up on the gas and the /saw grilse seizes the buggy like a vise . The effort of smashing a way through the dense masa began to tell on our buggy . A steady bubbling came from the radiator , and jets of steam shot out of the cap . Bud looked unworried . " Needs a relief , " he said , and waved for DeWitt to take his buggy around and break trail for a while . One of the first white men to cross the ' Glades , poling a canoe , wrote that it was better to go twenty  --  five miles around had saw grass than one mile through it . I got off the buggy and tried for myself . Contrary to legend , it does n't cut clothing to tatters or leave a man gashed and bleeding  --  although a blade caught between my collar and neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : st.ri I I NING rosT 3 , 1953 gnat ' t he WAWA ' ion of being choked to death in a jungle .

Several ! loom later , with radiators boilingfuriously , we brokt. out into a burn that stretched for miles to the southeast . II hooked us though a giant blowtorch bud swept over t he ' Glades . A blackened stubble wits all that remained of the old SSW gross , 1111 hough fresh goset ' Stools poked up everywhere thmugh several inches of miter . A bedraggled raccoon scrambling through the stubble was the only living t hing we passed . The Everglades is a paradox . Water is the lifeblood of its existence . By late summer in a wet year the vast , shallow sheet of water which covers it may be hip-deep in places . Yet in the driest winters the peat soil of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if a blaze in the saw grass could move fast enough to catch a buggy . Popenhager said no , not unless you were stuck . Ray Barnes looked back at the burned stubble and the deep gouges the multiple tires of the buggies left in the oozing marsh . " A man would be a fool to start down through here with anything but one of these , " he said fervently . The accomplishments of Popenhager 's buggies seem to produce a similar effect on anyone used to tackling the ' Glades with other transportation . Among others , I talked to Melvin H. Gallatin , a scientist with the Soil Conservation Service , of the Department of Agriculture , who was in on the job of running levels and corings across the ' Glades for a soil , geology and water-control report . That buggy Popenhager built for us would go anywhere . " Gallatin said . Each of Popenhager 's buggies has three axles , two drive shafts and ten tires , the latter around 7.50 x 20 's . The middle and rear axles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmissions connected in series . This yields so much traction that they do everything but climb trees . As the buggies sloshed across the soft muck they needed every bit of this traction . A man could have put up fence posts by simply shoving them in with his hands . And he would n't have hit bottom for ten , maybe fifteen feet . The going became worse as we approached a long , low line of green willows which had been visible across the burn for some time . " Better put your cleats on , Bud , " called Ramsey . These cleats consisted of lengths of iron bedstead set laterally in chains . Bud used them on the rear set of duals when the going became tough . " Do n't need ' em yet , " he called back to Ramsey . We went about another 100 yards through ankle-deep water . Then , without warning , the buggy lurched off into something that seemed to be a shallow ditch . " Gator crawl , " said Bud briefly . I knew what to do from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front wheels up the other side with our hands as the driving wheels behind fought for traction . This left the buggy driverless , but it 's standard Popen hager procedure when a bogging threatens . When we climbed aboard again , Barnes had news for us . " There 's a gator up ahead . Not very big , though . " Sure enough , high-stepping along in the shallow water by the willows was a little follow hardly big enough In ' mike an overnight bag . Ile was per/eluded to pose for a picture and released . Breaking through the willows , we found that they concealed I he hunks of a wide en nal . We caught one glimpse of the knot ' like eyes of a big gator before he mil ' merged . The whole Hutting looked us wildlisun African river . " Dug forty , fifty years ago , " Bud said . " They were going to drain the ' Glades . " Later , I checked I found that $18,000,000 wus spent digging such canals before the Everglades drainage project went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow disastrous fires in the dry season without preventing floods that sometimes inundate outlying sections of Miami . To illustrate further what a delicate balance had been upset , salt water began intruding on Miami 's well fields . After lunch Dick Hoefle waded the canal and found it not quite waist deep . He paused halfway across to ask Bill Piper solemnly whether the alligators would eat him . This gentle gibe had reference to the filming of some scenes from Distant Drums , a recent movie about the Seminole Wars , which Piper had told us about during lunch . For one of these the movie location party had dug a large alligator pit into which the vengeful Seminoles were supposed to throw the captured soldiers . Bill duly filled t he pit with very large alligators brought from his zoological garden . Batteries of lights were focused on the scene and the cameras readied . Then the director produced some kapok dummies dressed in uniforms and had them thrown into the pit . The man-eating alligators hurriedly retreated to the farthest corners . " They were scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finally solved the problem by stuffing uniforms with shark meat and feeding them to the gators back at the exhibit pen during their usual mealtime . And with the story about the " man-eating " gators vanished the qualms we might have had while working the buggies across the canal . When Dick said the bottom was solid , Popenhager drove off into the canal without any further ceremony . Toward the middle the water rose bubbling to the floor boards , the wheels disappeared completely and the engine 's fan kicked out a shower of spray . Ray Barnes watched in horror , predicting that water would seep into the crankcase . During this amphibious performance we heard a plane 's engine . It proved to be a state-game-department ship checking on our progress . Things must have looked just jolly to those in the plane , because it left . Ten minutes later , Bud had coaxed his buggy up the opposite bank , but the other was stuck in the middle with a drowned engine . Digging under a tarp , Ramsey triumphantly produced a shiny new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said with a wide grin . Straining and tearing up the canal-bank shrubbery , Bud 's buggy hauled the second one out . All was well until someone suggested checking the oil to See if perhaps water had run in . Sure enough , the dip stick showed several quarts too much . Popenhager had driven off up the canal to look for alligators . In the meantime we took stock . Ramsey sadly admitted he did n't have enough spare oil to refill the crankcase . When Popenhager returned he checked his dip stick on request and found a mixture of water and oil too . As he spoke , everyone listened gravely . " Shucks , " Bud said , " that 'll just make them run bettor , " And us for could ever see , it did . The buggies bulldozed their way out from the canal through a 100-yard strip of vine-tangled jungle that looked as if it ought to conceal pythons and boa constrictors . Branches nearly swept us off I he watts and ants , spiders and miscellaneous insects came aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swath of fill from the canal . When we stood on the edge of the open saw grass leading south once more , Bud stopped to read his compass . " Know anything about this country ahead ? " Ramsey asked , after consulting our map , which shoWed the canal , but was quite blank in other respects . " Nope , " Bud said . " Rurlly anybody gets in here . But it sure looks more interesting . " He was right. , but that did n't develop right away . The sun heat down out of a cloudless sky , the saw grass grew monotonous . As we beat south , the country became drier until the buggies were traveling over porous peat prairies which yielded like a damp sponge , but showed no water . By midafternoon the saw grass had thinned into strands with open grassy prairies in between . Ahead we saw our first tree islands , usually called hammocks . They were formed thousands of years ago when float ing islands of vegetation drifting down the Everglades caught and put down roots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and plants , and today each hammock is an exotic miniature jungle . One of these ahead was much larger than the others and marked by a great strangler-fig tree . We pulled the buggies up to it , and Piper and I prepared to climb it and make some pictures . We noticed a big nest in the upper branches which we took to be that of an owl seen flying away . But if so , he was keeping strange company . The nest was occupied by a big hoar coon which crawled out , growling , and made his way to a loftier perch . Shortly later we heard shouts from Popenhager , who was prowling the hammock . When I came down , everyone was examining a capful of ancient pottery fragments . Some were no bigger than a thumbnail , but others were several inches across . Most were plain , but some rim sections bore a tracery of Lines or scalloped indentations . " The whole place is covered with them , " Popenhager said . " It 's an old Calusa mound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an archaeologist who knew of his Everglades peregrinations . Later , as we picked up the bits of baked clay on a chain of similar hammocks to the south , a picture came easily to mind : slender dugouts poled through trails in the saw grass by brown-skinned warriors in breechcloths of plaited palmetto strips ; fish and game spitted over cooking fires tended by laughing women who welcomed the hunters ; thatch-roofed sleeping platforms surrounding an open space pounded hard by the heels of dancers . The Calusa Indians were the prehistoric dwellers of the ' Glades region . Archaeologists know a good deal more about how they lived than what became of them . Theories disagree , but , from the best evidence , a handful of the old Calusas still occupied the interior hammocks when the comparatively modern Seminoles began their retreat into the Everglades less than 150 years ago . According to my trip notebook , we stopped later at a little pond which Bud said was an old gator hole . Piper jumped off to see if the gator was prosier ! , but called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the buggy seats to look around and immedeaely spotted two buck deer less than 200 yards distant , in high grass . itacogniI ion was mutual nail Ihey hounded away . While we were watching them , two sinuous dark forms the size of H dog broke from the edge of the pond and made for a trig clump nf willows . Everyone yelled in excitement . Never having wean the Florida oiler herons , I did n't even realize what t hey were for a full minute . AS it grew dark we made camp on El big hammock . It showed no traces of ever having been used before , even by Indians . We built a lire , more to dispel the jungle gloom than anything else . and Barnes turned out corned-beef hash and coffee over a battered gasoline camp stove . " If we had some venison to work with . I 'd fix you a real meal , " he commented , After supper Bud climbed the usual big fig tree and took compass bearings on airway beacons along the Tamiami Trail . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud was aiming for a Seminole village on the Trail where we knew the deep roadside canal could be forded . " We 're making a lot better time than I expected , " he remarked . " But we 'll probably hit some wet sloughs ; tomorrow . " There were enough mosquitoes to encourage everyone to turn in early , but not the hordes with which legend endows the ' Glades . As the gang crawled into their mosquito bars , I noticed there was n't a single " jungle hammock " among us . These cocoonlike , war-surplus contrivances look ideal for ' Glades camping . But Piper dryly commented that anyone who could sleep comfortably in a jungle hammock could sleep wrapped around a rope . At noon the next day . after smashing all morning through strands of unexpectedly heavy saw grass . we stopped to investigate a big hammock island and made a find . In a cleared apace perhaps 100 feet across were the decaying polls where a dozen thatched Seminole chikees once stood . A thick stand of papaya trees gone wild intruded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melonlike fruit for years . Both sweet and sour orange trees grew farther back on the hammock . Embedded everywhere in the hard-packed ground were Calusa pottery shards , evidence that the Seminoles had acquired the site secondhand . From the looks of things , Popenhager estimated that the village had been abandoned for perhaps fifteen years . The Seminole occupants had probably moved down beside the Tamiarni Trail . We began to see the reason more clearly as we drove on south . Instead of wet sloughs , we hit marshes so dry that they were dusty . There was n't even an open water hole to keep any game in the area going . On that score Piper commented that the Seminoles had probably made things tougher by killing nearby alligators for their hides . The gators , he explained , used to keep water holes open in the dry ! tensors " When the water went down , the gators started digging the hole deeper . Made a little pond that carried over a lot of fish , turtles and even snaken until the next wet wagon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably a few got caught by the gatora , but it was a fair exchange . " During the afternoon we stopped at n dozen of theme old gator holm . All were minus occupants . But near one , Piper did catch tl cottonmouth moccasin . He spotted him in low grass rind stood right over him Mide the Bunke crawled between his lennie shoes , " Somebody hand me a Si ick or Renee thing , " he said in a conversational tone . Bud handed him n shovel off the buggy . He then used the handle to pin the snake 's head very greasy while he picked him up and dropped him in a hag . In spite of all the legends about the thousands of moccasins that lurk in the heart of the Everglades , this was the only one we saw on the entire trip . Bud said he did n't believe there ever had been many out in the open ' Glades. * * * * * * * * * * People just thought there were because during floods every snake for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the afternoon we saw the low line of pine trees that screened the Tamiami Trail highway . Near the Seminole village where we could cross the canal Dick Hoelle had tied a white rag in the top of a tree . When we discovered the marker only a quarter mile off our course , Bud got a round of applause . A few minutes later the two buggies lumbered dripping up from the canal onto the shoulder of the road . This startling sight began to tie up traffic and we hurriedly drove into William McKinley Osceole 's village . Neat counters of handmade souvenirs , from woven baskets to the multicolored jackets which are a Seminole trade-mark , await tourists in the front of his establishment . And for a quarter they can go behind the high board fence to stare with equal curiosity at the alligators in pens and the silent women who still cook and sew in the old way under the open , thatched chikees . Osceola , a chunky , affable man in his fifties , came out to greet us . We chatted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his teenage daughters , garbed in the traditional full skirt and cape , made change . He said the deserted village we had seen had last been occupied by a Seminole named Willie . There 's a strong historical belief that the last of the ( 7111111441H joined the Seminoles and intermarried . We asked Osceola , and when he grasped our morning he shook his lived . " Had In-dimes " he maid . " Always light my people . " Then he waved his hand toward the south and added that the Cnluaas still lived nut , there somewhere in the big hammocks . That was a most unexpected answer . Evidently Osceola had n't seen the " elephant " either . But it seemed like a good cue to climb hack aboard the buggies and hunt up those hammocks before civilization , in the form of cold drinks and a tempting road hack to Miami , overwhelmed us . We invited Osceola to accompany us in place of Ray Barnes , who had to return to duty . " Too hot , " said Osceola succinctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . The remainder of the trip lay through Everglades National Park , which buggies must have special permission to enter . - Just a few weeks before , we had made a rare crossing of the park along its mangrove coast . It was nice country ? flights of white-winged egrets flew overhead ; does scurried off , shepherding their fawns . But that edge is also accessible by boat . Most of the wildlife pictures are made there . What we were about to see now was the almost inaccessible center . I decided later that the park is like a doughnut ; the beet part is around the edge . Our course lay southwest for thirty-five miles down what Bud called the Shark River slough . It turned out to be a treacherous stretch of mareh between saw-grass jaws lined with weird rock teeth . When we deviated to one side , the buggies lumbered painfully over foot-high limestone knobs and eroded potholes that racked them beyond what any vehicle seemed able to stand . The terrain was now familiar to Popenhager , who looked about him reflectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way that the buggy would n't break down , " he told Bill Piper , who was waiting with interest for the buggy to come apart . He added that he was bringing out two injured men from a plane crash at the time . I happened to know the full story , which made headlines in Miami several years ago . All Bed bad done was volunteer to take a park crew in to brittle a big fire , pick up and bring out the two-man crew of a plane that crashed while directing the operation , and then return to help tight the lire for six days  --  all of this over a score of miles of country regarded as the most inaccessible in the park . It lay about us now in the gathering dusk like a land that time had forgotten  --  a darkening expanse as open as an African veld except for the low , shadowy walls of saw gram and the ghostly humps of hammocks . It waited only the rush of summer rains to turn into another world , a watery one loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds . We stopped for the night in the open , although Dick Hartle direly predicted that if it rained we would be flooded . Digging the camp water hole , I doubted it . The hole was arm's-length deep before water ran in . After supper we sat looking at the stare and listening to unseen things call from the darkness This brought on a imccimaion of Wes about wildcat , bear end panther . Sleep was slow in coming that night . Every time I dozed off , faint , dark forms began padding through camp . The next . morning started innocently enough with a pleasant prowl on an old Callum hammock where we found a tree blazed with a mysterious X. Off again , we exchanged solemn looks with two long-legged sand-hill crareei , Three hour , * and ' several hummocks later we were nearing our goal ? the maze of brackish creeks where the dugout canoes used to slip out through the salt-loving mangrove trees to the gulf . The saw grass , our companion for ninety long miles , thinned and finally disappeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bogs that quivered when the buggies passed . Ramsey dropped into his lowest gear and began to creep . I was riding with him under the parasol top to keep my cameras out of the rain which threatened momentarily to fall from a glowering thunderstorm overhead . A short distance ahead we could see where the ribbonlike creeks on either side entered a dense green wall ? the mangroves . " I wish Bud had his cleats on . This is bad stuff , awful had , " Ramsey said . with a worried look at the buggy ahead . We knew Bud meant to reach the mangroves , so that I could make a picture that would prove we completed the trip . He was hardly 100 feet short when his buggy began to sink . Dick Hoefle jumped off to lighten the load and promptly went in up to his knees . We jumped off to give them a hand and found what we were in . The grayish marl , formed as the bed of an ancient sea , was the consistency of thickened waffle batter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent that the mired buggy was more apt to dig a tunnel under the marl than roll over the top . Ramsey 's buggy was n't going to get out by itself , either , I noticed . As it sat quietly idling , it had sunk about a foot into the marl , SO that water welled up into the hollows around its tires . L tasted a mouthful and hurriedly spat it out . Just as salty as the sea . " Sure figured we could make it to the mangroves . " Bud said , eying the slender margin as though he still intended to try . There 's an ingenious way of freeing a ' Glades buggy from such a sticky situation . It consists of passing a light cable around a nearby tree and hooking the ends to two pairs of driving wheels on opposite sides . Thereupon the buggy will simply wind itself right up the cable like a Yo-yo on a string . ? Unfortunately . there were no trees in the proper direction , so we resorted to " grunting " the buggies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs at the nearest point of supply and stuffs them under the wheelie . Then everyone applies his shoulder and all grunt in unison . An hour of grunting extricated the buggies to a point where anything else on wheels would have been hopelessly stuck , but the buggies could get along nicely . Then we rolled back north toward the Trail in a pouring rain . Perhaps no one will ever repeat the trip . They 'll need a contraption that dotes on saw grass , gator holes , quivering bogs , rocks like dragon teeth , and waist-deep canals .
