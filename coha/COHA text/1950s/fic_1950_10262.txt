200on her in the candle light a face that told her what she must know . Suddenly the clock struck twelve , though you had to count fast to tell it . Sayward remembered with a touch of horror what Gerty had said , that on Sunday " the angel " said she could get up and run out . A curious shiver ran up her backbone . Could it be there was any truth in this wild talk of Gerty 's about an angel ? Other things she had given no thought to at the time swarmed in her mind , like whenever she sent the child on an errand , Gerty would ask so serious , " What will you do , Granmam , when I 'm not here to help you ? " And the time a canaler told her how the small tyke cried to his boy not to beat the poor mules so . The boy told her to mind her own business , but she stood right up to him and what she preached , he said , was good as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ask the Lord to forgive him when she went to Heaven . Sayward could tell nothing from the doctor 's face now , but the switching of the queue was going slower and slower . After while it stopped , and Dr. Pearsall laid down the small wrist . " Oh , Guerdon ! " Sayward called silently no babe asking about her pappy any more . " The sun was coming up when Sayward made her way home , but her face stayed set and cruel . A good many had she known who had to die , but never anyone who made such small fuss as Gerty did , like she was just going on a visit . Was she really out of her sick bed now , Sayward wondered , a running and playing like she claimed the angel had said ? Maybe she was , but though Sayward looked hard , never had she seen her get up and run out the door or rise to heaven either . Save when her grandmammy 's loving hands straightened the tiny limbs and closed the wornp 201eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a lick of muscle for that small body to lift itself up . Yet now it lay almighty still . Just the same , if it was n't true what Gerty told about the angel , it was the only thing that was n't . Now how did she know that Portius would be called up to Tateville ? He did n't know it his own self when Sayward left home yesterday afternoon and yet way back last week Gerty had said , " Now you better kiss me goodby , Granpappy , because you wo n't see me again . "  |p202THE  ROOF was up and the bricks laid out for the most part when Portius had enough of building himself a fine house and paying for it , too . He never said so . He had to go argue a case at an appellate court and could n't tell how long it would drag on . At least , that 's what he claimed . Then the legislature was naming a new justice for the county , he said , and Fred Godwin , the senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance . Would Sayward look after his house-building while he was gone ? " Why do n't you get Oliver Meek ? " she wondered . " He 's put up a good many houses . " " It would be an imposition , " he said shortly . " Well , how about Resolve ? You would n't have to mind asking him . " " Resolve 's too young and inexperienced to cope with such matters . " " He 's thirty years old . You can depend on him . " p 203 " Not like I can depend on you , Sayward , " he said and gave her such a good sociable smile it minded her of the night they were married . She could n't refuse him then . Nor could she now , though by today she knew him backwardsand forwards , his fine ways , his good points , and his Yankee tricks . But she did n't know what she was in for this time till he had gone . Every day she put off going over to the house . Gowan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finer houses in Americus and Tateville . He took care of most everything , Portius said , drawing the plans , writing the bills of lumber , making contracts with masons and plastererand overseeing their labors . None could handle a T square or triangle like he could , but his crew of journeymencarpenters did the work . His wood carver had been busy all summer on the fine Pennsylvania pine that came down the Ohio for the doorway and chimney pieces . Gowan showed him what to do . All there was to know about putting up a house , Gowan knew , Portius claimed . Gowan 's word was good as his bond . Then what was the use , Sayward asked herself , of her going over ? So she waited till he came to see her , a broad man of great dignity , in a striped cotton coat , his face red against his white hair as service berries in the snow . He lifted his hat with honest respect at the door . " I am loathe to trouble you , Mrs. Wheeler , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I would n't know what use I 'd be , " she told him . " But I 'll come if you want me . " " It will do the journeymen good to see you take an interest , " he said with great relief . " They complain they 'll never get their money . " Sayward took a quick gulp and swallowed it. p 204 " Are you saying the men are back in their wages ? " she put to him . " Not too far , Mrs. Wheeler , " he said like it had to be dragged from him with horses . " Mr. Wheeler said you would make everything right when you came . " Sayward stood so quiet , never would you guess the bump she had had inside of her . " I guess maybe I better come over and look at it right away , " she told him . " You can expect me some time this morning . " So that was it , she told herself as she started up the new street . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stay out of other folks ' doings . All this time had she kept clear of Portius 's house , for she heard enough about it from the girls and from visitors to her kitchen . Of course , she could n't help seeing the brick walls heaving up when she went that way . She could tell it was no cabin or shanty that Portius was putting up , but she had no notion how big it really was till she came up Wheeler Street today and saw it standing in front of her on the square like Captain Loudon 's brick mansion house when she was a girl along the Conestoga . Only the Loudon house stood flat on the ground while Portius had set his up high and proud . It would take many a step to reach that big front door , though now all they had was plank running up from the ground . She hated real hard to turn in and go up that mortarencrustedgangway . The house seemed a monster roofed shell , owning neither doors nor window lights . All stood open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors and bare high walls , the stink of wet plaster , the great lack of things still to be done and paid for before you could live in here fazed her . But she made herself tramp with Mr.p 205Gowan from one big empty room and floor to another . It looked like they had more room than the court house with the jail thrown in . What in the name of the white-whiskeredman did Portius want with all this living space ? He would n't , she knew , let her rent any of it out . Why , if she was a little tyke she 'd have to watch out or she 'd get lost in here . Oh , her eyes looked close at what the carpenter pointed out . She listened sober to all he told her , of sash and blinds , of shutters and baseboard , of door and window jambs , cornice gutters and scuttle , of back stoop and front stoop and sloping cellar door . But all the time in her mind she was reckoning how much Portius 's grand house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact , " Gowan said at the end when she asked him . " But I can give you an idea . " " That 'll have to do then . " " You expect to finish it , do n't you , Mrs. Wheeler ? " he asked and looked at her like a grandsire begging for the life of his grand littling . " I ca n't rightly tell you till tomorrow , " Sayward said . " But you 'll have to tell me today . " Not till then did he draw from his back pocket his MasterBuilder 's Price Book and Estimator bulging with ciphering . Well , she got what she asked for , she told herself on the way home . That 's the way it went sometimes . Run through everything you had . Let little in at the spile and all out at the bung ! Make common folks point when they went by and say , " That 's Lawyer Wheeler 's fine house . " Make tony folks a little less proud when they came calling , a climbing marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse wagon through and stairs running up and up like they went to a church belfry . Was n't it curious , Saywardp 206thought , how some folks had to bamboozle other folks with the clothes they wore or strike them all in a heap with the grand house they lived in ! When the rest were in bed that night , Sayward took out what bank notes she had put away between the logs behind the chinking . Under the hearth stone she took up her old kettle with a hole but heavy with gold and Spanish silver . She counted standing by Portius 's desk table , summingup what she had in the bank and out with folks on interest . Oh , she had plenty to make buckle and tongue meet , and that did n't count her land leased and unleased . What went against her so hard was putting so many bells on one horse , squandering for something she did n't want in the first place and would have to live in against her will in the second . Neither did she take kindly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off without opening his mouth . She had no notion he had used up all his Aunt Unity 's money . Likely he would get still more when her house was sold . No , he had put in what he reckonedwas his half of the house . Now she could put in the other half , for was n't she going to live in it the same as he would ? That must be the way he figured . She stayed up a while reckoning this thing out , casting up one side against the other . In the end she put back the kettle and went to bed . The mansion house was too far built to give up now , unless you did n't want to look folks in the eye any more . No use fretting all night . The more you cried , the less you had to pee , as Granny MacWhirter used to tell the young ones . If Portius would n't pay his honest debts , she would have to , a little slowly perhaps , one at a time like lawyers went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay her hands on , she 'd have to spit on them and take a fresh holt. p 207Portius came home in a fortnight , but the house took nigh onto two years to finish . The staircase alone swallowed up four months with its treads , risers , posts and handrail . Oh , Portius was back home a good while before the house was done , but never did he take over again . He had no time , now that he was a judge , he claimed , looking at her when he said it like he wanted her to see what his fine house had brought him already . He acted like he was glad enough to let her bear the brunt , now that she could n't strike down any of the walls or rooms but would have to accept them without mutiny . Sayward let him shirk , satisfied to do the rest to suit her . The woodwork inside and out she had painted white . It would take more dusting and scrubbing to keep clean , but Gowan told her this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unwise not to speak to Gowan about , she used her own good sense , choosing the plainer when Gowan assented and fetching in Fay and Resolve for their opinion when he did n't . Oh , Gowan was a great help on one hand and a thorn in her side on the other , knowing all the fine houses he did and how they had been built inside and out . " Now in the Maclay house in Pennsylvania , " he would say , or " If I could show you General Gregg 's house in Kentucky . . . . " Little by little she let herself be pounded or cajoled into wall paper and mortise locks , inside shutters and plenty other things she did not know much about but had to put in for Resolve , Huldah , Sooth or Gowan even though they would not live there . The moving she put off till the very last . The truth was she hated to leave the cabin . Most of her life had she lived here . Now she would have to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting on airs , thinking herself better than ordinary folks . The last day she kept looking aboutp 208the cabin . How many times had she stood at the fire with her long-handled pan , or gone down on her knees of a morning to puff at the coals . This ladder and those steps , how often had she climbed them when one of the young ones lay abed ailing . Why , forty years of her life had she spent between these log walls . And now she had to go and leave them . Welly Palsgrove and his one-horse wagon helped her move . Yesterday was the first Portius claimed to have been in the new house since it had doors and windows , and he could n't get done praising how well she finished it . Today when she and two of the girls got to the square with their first wagonload , a heap of boards and crating lay in the front yard . Massey came running out , her pigtails flying . " You ought to see , Mama ! " she cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libby and Dezia raced ahead , but Sayward stayed behind with Welly to help him lift off and carry in . Just the same she could n't help seeing when she got inside . A noble hatrack , table and settee stood in the wide hall , and through the door to the room Fay always called the front parlour she had a look at stylish chairs and sofas with fine cloth seats and backs , and small shiny tables with curved legs . Rugs lay this way and that on the boards . Upstairs , when she and Welly got there with her cherry bedstead , she found beds already set up in both front bedrooms , one of yellow maple and one of some tony red wood , both with high posts . The girls were hanging up the curtains . Dower chests lay under two windows . Standing around were rushbottomchairs and small rockers , bureaus and what Mrs. Morrison called highboys . This room she looked in had something else , like a massive redwood chest of drawersp 209save for the slanting top which opened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red pigeon holes , the writing part stained by blobs of black ink . " What do you think of it ? " she heard Portius ask , and there he was behind her . " Well , I ai n't had much time to think about it yet , Portius , " Sayward said . " It looks real grand though , I must say . " " I thought I 'd take this room and you could have the one across the hall , " he told her . " These arc Aunt Unity 's best beds . " His eyes fell on what she and Welly had fetched up , the heavy headboard of the bed that had seemed so fine and served them so long and faithfully in the cabin . " Do n't you want to take that up on the third floor for one of the children ? " he asked . It came over her then and as she went on fetching in her other things how poor and puny they looked here besideAunt Unity 's . Why , she thought she had half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like one of those sassafrac folks from out in the brush fetching her poor traps in a fine mansion house . It was really her house as much as Portius 's , for had n't she built and paid a good half of it ? And yet she found no welcome between these fine plaster walls or among the rich Wheeler trappings . Always had she seen a little Monsey blood in her pappy and Achsa , but this was the first time she felt it stand out in herself . Dog tired as she was , it went hard to fall asleep in Aunt Unity 's bed that night , lying like a corpse at a wake , she thought , between the polished posts like mourners holding some net over her so her flesh would not be fly-eaten . She felt so far off the floor . Even when the gentry lay down to sleep not knowing if they 'd wake or not , they had to hold themselves high and mighty as possible . She would hate top 210have the old time friends and neighbors she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Saird has changed , they would say . She has forgot how naked she came into this world and in company with what worms she has to go out . When Sayward first woke up next morning , she had to lie and think for a lick where she was . It came in her head next how on both sides they had strange folks lying in bed the same as they and so close she could throw a stone at them . She got up mighty quick then and went down the back stairs . It was hardly daylight , but that was all the better , for those on either side would not be out yet . She would have given a good deal to be back in the cabin , but she was only thankful she had a kitchen here . It helped her to start a fire and feel her own pots and pans in her hands . Here with the smell of mush and coffee over the fire , she believed she could come when she got homesick and find relief . They reddied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday about supper time it started to rain , but that , she noticed , did n't keep Huldah and George , and Sooth and Peter with little Sairdy from coming over . Afterwards Genny and Will came in the back way while Resolve and Fay came the front , without Henry and Mary Leah who had a nursemaid to look after them . Something was up , Sayward knew , but she reckoned it only a kind of house warming . Not till she saw this man at the door in reddish sideburns very wide at the bottom and in the high choking collar and multiple buttons of a junior officer in the navy did she guess . " Kinzie ! " she called out in that strange hollow voice she 'd heard her mother use when she was so beat out . Then she stood like a stump while he came over . She felt herp 211knees tremble . Could this grown-up officer who held himselfso easy and strong be the freckle-faced boy that rode east on horseback those years ago and had been all over the world since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good time ? It must be the girls and Portius had been keepinghim posted , for he landed the first week they were in the new house . Before he reached her , his navy face broke into a freckled grin , she saw the tooth she 'd know anywhereand felt the water run from her eyes as she hugged him . But only half that water , she knew , was for him . The rest flowed for his brother who was n't here at all , and God Almighty alone knew where he was or whether still among the living . " So this is Massey ! " Kinzie said , swinging her up . He had n't seen her since she was a little tyke or Chancey since a tot in a red plaid skirt that had come down from Libby to Sooth to Dezia and none of them could wear it out . To Massey he gave a kiss , but he only twisted Chancey 's weak arm , giving a funny look at his spindly legs and the scraggly nape of his neck as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make the riffle and looks scared of his own shadder my brother ? Oh , Chancey felt himself shrink at that look . But if Kinziedid n't think much of him as a brother , Chancey did n't reckon him a brother at all . Under his navy officer clothes and ways , he was just like the rest of the Wheelers , made of some everlasting mortal stuff that never tired or flinched , never gave up or wore out . You could n't miss that certain quality tonight now that they were all together again , talking at once , running over with vitality , each a glut for punishment , quick to go on their lip or muscle . Just to sit quiet among them drained Chancey like a sieve . He did n't mind hearing it was past his and Massey 's bed time. p 212Up in his room on the third floor , he could still hear what his father called the Luckett Indian whoop . It was just energy and enthusiasm that came out at times like this . It spoke a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulation , amusement or just enjoyment of life , as they whooped tonight when they haw a boyhood friend catch his first sight of Kinzie since he was back . A new sound fetched Chancey out of bed and into the hall . Faint light came up the third floor stairs and a rich sound with it . Somebody was touching Aunt Unity 's piano . The boy leaned over the bannister . He could look down the deep well of stairs to the reddish whale-oil light in the hall . He could see a green strip of carpet , the edge of the table and settee . It might be Fay showing Sooth how to play , he thought . First would come sure rich notes , then after a little , slower and less certain ones . If that was Sooth , she was catching on fast . The sure hands played again . They ran among strange keys and worked out chords that made Chancey stand stock still , his bare toes gripping a bannister post . He held his breath trying to hold his emotion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first part again . Just as it reached the most beautiful part of all , the talk , that had been going on all the time , broke out in shouts and laughter , drowning out the piano . The desecrationangered the boy . His heart filled with blackness and oaths . His toes loosed from the railing . After a moment , he went back in his room and closed the door . When everybody had gone home , Sayward finished the girl 's work in the kitchen and went to bed . Even with her door open to the hall , she felt pretty much alone . It seemed so far from Kinzie and everybody else in this big house. p 213In the cabin they all had lived and slept close together . But she might as well get used to it . For the rest of her life , this would likely be her lot . Portius was willing enough for her to sleep alone for style 's sake now , though he had raised sand when she had done the same thing in the cabin . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . Gowan had made these walls tight as the bottom of a new kettle . It seemed town folks thought the night air poisonousand wanted to keep it out . But she slept out many a night , and it never hurt her . Poison or no poison , she liked the night air , such as used to sift through the chinking of the cabin . She thought they had been up late tonight , but it seemed like other folks were up later . Lying there she could hear the voices of a company of people coming down the square . The talk grew pleasantly nearer . Now they were going past the house and now stopping at a door beyond where some of the party lived . " Goodnight ! Goodnight ! " the voices called back and forward . " Pleasant dreams ! We had such a nice evening ! " More things were called as the rest of the party went on . A half dozen houses away a man thought of something else to shout back . It sounded like John Quitman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived most of her life in the woods and fields to hear . Only those who knew what it meant not to see a strange face from one season to another could appreciatehow sweet was the music of human voices . She took after her mother 's side and liked the feel of other folks around , although that did n't mean they had to live right up against you . Across the field or through a patch of woods would be close enough , just so you could see the smoke of their chimney and hear them call the dog , cows or young ones. p 214Now was n't it a shame , she thought as she went to sleep , that little Gerty had n't lived long enough to visit here . She 'd have company then , for Gerty always loved to sleep with her grandmam . Her warm voice and running feet would take up some of the slack and coldness in this house . That 's what the place needed . It would n't seem so empty and useless with a lively little body around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p 215THE TENCH house stood along the river like a box with two or three uneven windows , a roof of black shakes above , and a dark slab fence around it below . All evening in that house Rosa had the tight , stretchedoutfeeling she always had before her father came . It had started today about four o'clock when Mr. Higgins , the man in Oliver Meek 's store , put up the sign on the sidewalk . TO RENTBy that , Rosa knew her father 's boat was tied up in the basin , though he was n't home as yet . This kind of thing had been going on for a long time . Whenever her father got too far back in the rent , Mr. Higgins would put up the sign , always the same one . Her father would n't see it 216when he first came home . That usually happened late at night , and , besides , when he was drunk he took no notice of signs . But the next day when he went out of the house and saw it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly , pull it out by the stake and throw it down the river bank . But he would never break it or hurt it . Sooner or later he would scrape up the money to pay Mr. Meek the four dollars a month back rent he owed him . After while Mr. Higgins would come up and get the sign and take it back to the store . He knew just where on the river bank to look for it , and he never got mad like Rosa 's father . The rain reached the house tonight long before her father did . A little while after supper she had to take the big jar and pan up in the loft where the roof leaked and go up now and then to empty them in the bucket before they spilled over . She could tell downstairs by the sound whenever one was getting close to the top . The pan always got full first , and if she did n't watch out , it would run over the loft and down in the room . Oh , it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed but could sit up late tonight watching her mother read . Her mother was a wonderful reader . You never even saw her lips move . Every two weeks or so , Rosa had to go down to the back door of the Phillips ' house to take one book back and get another if Mrs. Phillips had one to give her . Most times the maid had the book ready , wrapped in the Ohio Repository . The same paper went back and forward and her mother never failed to read that too . including the sermons , the advertisementsand the death notices under the heading , " END OF EARTH " which always struck a kind of terror in Rosa . Once Mrs. Phillips took her into a room in the house where the walls were covered with books. p 217 " I 've always taken an interest in your mother , " she told Rosa . " I feel sorry for her in her present station . " Now Rosa sat watching her mother 's eye run along the page , trying to tell from her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa read the books for herself . " You 're much too young . Novels and plays are n't for young girls , " she said sharply , but her face never changed either then or when she read , or if it did , you could n't see it through the film of unwashed olive that had gathered on her skin ever since the girl could remember , growing a little darker green with time . But sometimes as her mother read , her eyes would dilate and gather , the light in them would heighten , and the pupils deepen so Rosa could look far back in them , and after a moment she seemed to be in there herself with the bright mysterious light of the story all around her , with things happening to the right and left , but never could Rosa quite tell what they were , for you could n't see , just feel , them , and they had no shape save shadows . All of a sudden she found herself sitting up in her chair . She heard them bringing her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark flame threatened her . She knew it was her father , for she could hear his voice . No one ever brought him home before that she could remember . He came by himself , very late , as a rule . No matter how much he drank , nobody needed to help him , and yet it sounded like there were two men with him tonight . They came stumbling up on the porch and her father opened the door . Something flew into Rosa then , for he had a great rag stained with blood around his head . The men with him would come no farther than the doorway . They were grown waterfront men and yet shiedp 218away from her mother as the boys did who ventured in the yard with Turkey . " Jake got in a little argument , Miz Tench , " Boiling WilliamGates broke the news cautiously . " But he 's all right . It was a draw . " " It was a fight , " Strap Johnson corrected . " Tell her about Pete Easley ! " Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake and Pete got in a little argument at the tavern , " Boiling William started again . " It was a knock-down , drag-out fight , " Strap insisted . " Tell her how I bit off his nose ! " Jake shouted . " If my mouth 'd a been bigger , I 'd a bit off his head . " " He bit off a chunk of you first , " Strap reminded . " You see what I mean , Miz Tench , " Boiling William said . " That 's what made it a draw . Jake bit off Pete 's nose and Pete bit off Jake 's ear . " " Take the rag off and show her , Jake , " Strap urged . " Maybe she could put some liniment on . " While they talked , Rosa 's mother sat there hardly listening . All the peculiar yellow light from the novel had gone out of her eyes , as if what she looked at and listened to now was n't real life or true . No , the real world was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the place open , waiting to return to it as soon as this make-believe scene from a story was over . Nothing changed on her face as Jake fumbled with the bloody rag . Before he got it off , Rosa bolted , slipping between the two men at the door . " Rosa ! " her mother called . But Rosa fled , out of the gate into darkness like a moth suddenly released from the window pane . It seemed for a minute that her feet never touched the ground . An effortlesspower flowed through her , lightening her legs andp 219body , lifting her up like a bird . Never had running and the darkness tasted so sweet . The rain felt good in her face and washed it . She held open her lips to let it wash out her mouth . She let the clean night air wash through her flesh and mind . It cooled her to see nothing , nothing but shapelessshadows and the yellow lights in other houses that carriedoblivion from her own . She could remember when she was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought her father to go all that long way himself and how clever that he could find his way back . In the dark houses people already lay sleeping . She would have the night to herself . Only the dogs in this part of town were awake , tied in their backyards , sending their alarm down the line . She walked so lightly now , hardly did she kick a pebble . Now how could the first dog to bark know that such a small body as she should n't be abroad ? Dogs , they said , could tell if a body was good or bad . Then why could n't they tell she was only a slip of a girl who would n't hurt them , not even a hair of Cottrils 's fice that had bit her so she still carried the scar on her knee ? When anybody came along , she hid by the side of a house till they passed . Not that she had to . She had gone out many a time before when her mother said she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute ! " she 'd beg and then she 'd walk up and down with the moon . No matter how far she walked , the moon would walk with her , all the way and back again . She would n't be locked out those nights and she would n't be tonight . Never from one year to another did her mother bar the door , for nobody dared come in their house even in the daytime . Oh , her mother would scold her with scalding words when she got back , but they would n't hurt , and if they did , her walk would be worth it , getting away for a while , looking through win-p 220dows into rooms where candles still burned . Daytimes you could see nothing inside , but at night her eye could go right through the glass . She could see herself living there in other folks ' houses , sitting on those chairs , eating or reading at the table , lying on the couch . Down on the Square , most of the houses still had light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , save those in the taverns . An invisible lady came out of her front door calling , " Here , pussy , pussy , pussy . Come , pussy , pussy , pussy ! " Rosa moved around the Square slowly , feelingthe spell of the great houses , the awe of the court house ball and the sacred presence of the church with the graves behind it . That was Judge Wheeler 's new mansion house standing so high on its white marble steps . Nine regular steps it had and a little step at the top to go to the front door . Why did they have the little step , she wondered . You could n't see it tonight . She would like to go up and try it with her feet , but somebody might come out and catch her . That was old Judge Wheeler himself she saw through the window , with the great bulging forehead and the bush of hair on the top . He thought himself so much . Her father said he had been his lawyer , yet never would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , his big head down , his brows drawn over some weighty matter , the green bag in his hand . Tonight she could see Judge Wheeler 's wife with him . The house stood so high , Rosa could only see the top of her head . She was the plainest woman on the Square and the richest . She was part Indian , they said . Her hair was combed plain , parted in the middle . She was common as dirt and spoke to everybody when she passed . Twice she had spoken to her , once on the street and once when shep 221took the flowers . But when Rosa came home and told about it , her mother said never to speak to her or any other Wheeler , and especially not with that young liar , Chancey . Better had she cross the street when she saw a deceitful Wheeler coming . Was n't it a strange thing about people in this world , why they were themselves and why you were the person you were ? When she tried to think who it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she seemed to be blown away and lost far back in her mind . She felt giddy and queer , as she did when she looked at a star and pretended herself way up there hanging on it . She could see a light high in the house , on the third floor . Somebody must live high under the roof . The younger girls and Chancey likely . They must dress and undress and sleep up there . When they got tired of being downstairsthey could run up the steps and get away from everybodyand everything . Were n't they lucky to have a place to be by themselves ? They could look out like birds . They could lie in bed in the morning and see green leaves wave by their window and clouds sail by . Was n't it the saddestthing in this world that you always had to be yourself , that you could n't be somebody else , that never , never , never could you be the person you most wanted to be ? p 222IT was a winter 's day and bitter cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be out in the wind without a heavy coat . She was upstairs sewing by the window when she saw him . Now who could he be looking in at the house , as he went by ? He had on a battered slouch roaram hat and corduroy jacket like an old hunting coat . His leggins were snowy to his knees . Just the same , he held himself mighty straight , like an old poking stick that had been used a long time , worn thin and soon to be thrown on the fire . Hardly had he passed till he turned and tramped slowly back , looking at the house again . Why , he was turning in ! She could n't hear his rap from the stairs but she could his boots stamp off the snow on the back porch . Chancey and Massey were at their schools , Dezia at the seminary . When Sayward opened the back door , the old man stood there with a drop froze at the end of his nose , his cheeks crossedp 223and criss-crossed with a mess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree in the snow . " Is this Judge Wheeler 's place ? " he wanted to know . " Step in the warm , " Sayward bid him kindly . At the same time she was thinking , now where did I hear that voice before and see those eyes running back in his head ? Are you his woman ? " he asked , holding back . And when she nodded . " Then you must be Saird . Do n't you know me any more ? " Sayward stared at him a moment . Then she took the broom and swept the snow from his legs and boots . " I know you but I ca n't name you , " she complained . Something in the way he said " Saird " touched off a queer notion in her and when he came in and stood there in the kitchen with his hat on , a storm of feeling ran over her . It could n't be . No , it could n't possibly be . Why , all the old folks thought her father dead this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skinning wild bulls beyond the Mississippi , and that was thirty-five years ago . One of those wild bulls , Portius allowed , must have killed him . Hardly an Indian would , for Worth had Indian in his blood and could get along with them if anybody could . Genny thought that a Spanishman must have cut his throat for his gold . He had sent word how well off he was , but this old bushnipple in her kitchen today did n't look like he ever had a shilling to his name . " Is it you , Pap ? " Sayward asked . " I never expected to see you again ! " " You know me now ! " he called out , pleased . " It took you a good while . But I do n't blame you . I would n't a knowed you from Adam 's ox . You 're married to the lawyer , they tell me . I knowed him before I went but I never looked for you to get hitched to him . " p 224 " Take a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make you something to warm you up . " She remembered how he never drank tea or coffee . Slops , woodsmen used to call them . Liquor was the only drink to stick to a man 's guts , they said . Sayward made him a hot toddy , putting in lots of brown sugar , and he sat there , sucking it up from the cup from time to time with a lusty rattle . " Achsa stayin ' with you ? " " No , she 's not here any more . In fact she 's gone nigh as long as you have . We do n't know if she 's living or dead . " Some of the brightness went out of those shiny black buttons at the bottom of his eye pits . " Well , Ginny and Louie are still around ? " " Genny is . She 's married again . Will Beagle 's her second man . But Louie 's gone . He 's the one Achsa run off with . We heard he drowned in a river up beyond the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup on his knee . It took him a while to digest this . " Well , Wyitt 's all right , ai n't he ? " he asked . " We hope so , " Sayward said carefully . " He always was . Somebody told Jake Tench he saw him in the woods of Michigan territory , but he never sent word home himself . We thought maybe he would run into you some place out there . " Her father shook his head . He sat still a long time . Saywardthought he was thinking of her sister , Sulie ; wonderinghad they ever had news of her . But he did n't mention her name . Likely he was afraid to , for Sulie was his favorrite . " You know you 're a grandpappy now and a great-grandpappyto boot ? " she said to cheer him up . " I have nine of my own and one dead . And six grandchildren a living . " p 225But he could n't get up any sap over his great-grandchildren . They were too distant a relation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once he had a look at them and they at him . " This is Massey , " Sayward said . " And this is Chancey , the youngest . This is your Grandpap Luckett . Go up and shake hands with him . " The two in their teens looked startled . This seedy and feeble old codger with shaggy white hair , ragged corduroy coat and britches worn to the rib could n't be their famous grandfather , the great hunter and pioneer they had heard so much about , the first white man in these parts and the founder of Americus ! Why , he did n't look like he could knock over a rabbit , let alone panther and bear . They went up to him reluctantly . But Worth was just as distant with them , dropping their hands like they were small fry out of the river , too scanty to bother with and had to be thrown back in . He went on talking to Sayward of where he had been and what he was doing the day he got the notion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for good . For all the notice he gave , Chancey and Massey were n't even there , but when Dezia came in from the seminary , a full grown young lady , dressed and polite like the gentry , Worth got up to retreat . " Sit down , Pap , " Sayward urged him . " No , I got to go , " he told her . " Go where ? You 're staying with us . We got plenty room . " " No , I 'd be in the way . " " You would n't any such thing , " Sayward protested . " You can have a room all by yourself . On the second floor so you do n't have to climb so much stairs . " p 226 " I figured I ought to stay with Ginny , " he mumbled . " She has no young ones , you say . That might work out better . I 'm not used to young ones rippin ' and tearin ' around . " " They wo n't bother you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Worth allowed . " But all I come for was to see you . Now I have to be going . " " Well , you 're staying to supper anyways , " Sayward said sternly like it was all settled . " We can talk the rest over afterward . " He threw a sidelong glance through the door to the sparkle of brass and china and claw-footed mahogany in the dining room . " No , I got some things to do , " he persisted . " Will Beagle has a boat yard , you say ? " The girls and Chancey looked relieved , but Sayward stood there half provoked . She had lost patience with her own father . She had n't seen him for thirty-five years and now he was running off without his supper . " Well , when are you coming back ? " she asked . " Oh , I 'll be back some time to see you . I expect to stay around . " " Well , if there 's no stopping you , Chancey can run along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her how you put me out by not staying . " Chancey put his coat and cap back on , and Sayward went around to the front window to see them go . She hated her father going off like this , but if he would n't do a thing , you could n't make him . She recollected how when her mother used to try , his eyes would get that sunken look , he 'd pick up his rifle and that would be the last they 'd see of him for a couple of days. p 227Seldom did Genny 's tongue run faster than next time she came over . Was n't Sayward struck in a heap when she saw that old man at the door ? Who 'd a thought their father still among the living ! And the contrary old mule was still like always . He ate his supper with her and Will , but do you reckon he 'd stay the night ? No , he claimed he slept out all his life , and that was n't true because he used to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Will if he did n't have a place in the boat yard he could stay in , and when Will said he had a shanty the men used , Worth had to move right out . He would n't even sleep a single night in one of her beds . What would people think , their father coming back like this and living out in an old boat yard shanty ? They 'd think he was n't good enough for his own daughters and that she and Sayward had turned him out . " He run off from us young ones and let us raise ourselves , " Genny complained . " He stayed off thirty-five years . Now that we amount to a little something in this world , he comes back to disgrace us . " " I would n't say that , Genny , " Sayward said mildly . " He came back ragged and dirty , did n't he ? He told who he was in front of the whole town . Why , he never used to look that bad in the woods with nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you to shave him just to go over to Hough 's trading post in Shawaneetown . " " We have to recollect he 's a mighty old man , " Sayward mentioned . " He 's not too old to have a woman , " Genny flared . " Barney Grice told Will he knew Pap down in Memphis last fall but he did n't know he was any relation to us . Barney said Pap had a woman they called Old Profanity . They lived together on the water front . Barney doesn'tp 228know if she 's along up with him here or not . But , Saird , " Genny 's voice rose , " I wo n't stand for her if she is ! The minute he fetches her to the boat yard , he 's got to get out . " " Well , that 's his business , and I 'm not a going to fret about it , " Sayward soothed her . " All we can do for him now is see he gets some decent clothes . " " And then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anything you give him he 'll hoard up like a squirrel ; lock it up in the old chest Will gave him . " " Well , let 's give him a chance before we jump on him . Most likely he 'll do the right thing . If he wo n't , we 'll have to rig up ways to get around him . For instance , if he wo n't come up to eat at my place , I 'll have to send him something down to his shanty . Supper would suit me best . That 's when we have our heavy meal now on account of Portius not getting home much at noon . Then I 'll have one of the children free to send it down with . But I do n't want you complaining it looks like you do n't have enough to feed him . " That 's the way it was settled . Sayward herself went down to see him whenever she could . It hurt something deep inside of her to come from her fine big house and see her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low she had to duck her head coming in , his bed a bunk against one side . No more than two could sit in here at one time unless they sat on the bunk . " Why wo n't you stay with us in the house , Pap ? " she 'd asked him , but he never would . One time he told her , " Right where your place stands , I shot the deer with the blue horn . Do you mind that ole blue horn ? It had a mess of points . Oh , that was a handsomespot them days . I kin see it yit with the big butts and creepers the way God Almighty made it . Why , it was sop 229thick around ' ar , that buck never seed me . And now all slashed off and gone to rack and ruin . I kai n't look at it . Only thing left is the river , and that do n't look like itself with the woods killed off and not near the water coming down that used to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the supper basket . He and Massey hated still worse when their school mates asked , " Is your grandfather still living down at the boat yard ? " But the older girls said , " Thank God the old man is n't in the house now that Aunt Cornelia is coming . " Seldom if ever was it " Grandfather " or " Grandpap . " No , it was , " the octogenarian " or " the ancestor " or " the old man of the Western Waters " or " Mama 's old Indianfighter and painter-tracker . " Portius was the one who put them up to it , especially now that his fine blue stockingsister was coming from the Bay State to visit them in Ohio . The first time Sayward laid eyes on her , she had to admit to wonder how she and her would get along . Portius had looked for his sister by boat . That way she could n't have got to Americus before June . But one day late in May , Sayward and Dezia were house-cleaning when they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver go out of his way , but this time he drew up right in front of their house , and Sayward knew it must be for a good reason even before Ned Hanshaw got down from his seat and set a pile of traps on the sidewalk . Then he opened the coach door and a lady stepped down . Could that be Portius 's sister ? Sayward thought . She had always reckoned Cornelia Wheeler like Mrs. Morrison , tall and sweeping , with a handsome face and gracious manner . Now this was a short plain woman more like Aunt Unity and with a face like the pope 's . Her bonnet looked plainp 230and old style enough , her hair drawn down severely on either side . Yet the stern way she held herself , the costly look of her ribbed taffeta and the respectful way Ned Hanshawtreated her told you that this was a great lady and one more to reckon with than Mrs. Morrison . Dezia fled upstairs to change her dress , but Sayward went right out as she was in her red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting in the street with her traps and everybody in the stage and square a watching . " I 'm Saird . I reckon you 're Cornelia , " she said and gave the white fingers in the black mit a stout shake . " You are Portius 's wife ? " His sister 's eyes went over her distant as Bay State Mountain , but Sayward would n't explain that they had n't looked for her yet , and that 's why she was n't better dressed . " Come right in . I 'll fetch your traps , " she said . " Portius will be real surprised when he comes home and finds you 're here . " She spoke friendly like sisters-in-law should , but already she felt that Cornelia Wheeler looked down on her . Saywardthought she would n't mind too much . The only thing Portius 's sister better not look down on was her children , for they had Wheeler blood a flowing in their veins the same as their Aunt Cornelia . Not so much perhaps , but enough to let them stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She need n't have fretted . When Dezia came down , all dressed up , her Aunt Cornelia gave her plenty of notice . " So this is Dezia of whom I 've heard so much ! " she said in her genteel Bay State voice and held her cheek to be kissed , which she had n't to Sayward . Her keen blue Yankeeeyes surveyed the girl . " Did your father ever tell you that you look like your Grandmother Wheeler , child ? Inp 231everything I may say but your hair . Your Grandmother Wheeler used to brush her hair ten to fifteen minutes every morning and evening . She was a very resourceful and determinedwoman . She was determined to have beautiful hair , and she did . " That , Sayward found later , was her sister-in-law to a T. She turned her sharp Yankee eyes on every young Wheeler that came around , reminded them who they were and started to make them over right away . No matter if they were half Luckett and part Indian and lived way out West here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the Bay State . She told Massey at once that her name was not Massey but Me'cy , that there had been a Me'cy Hopewell who converted the Indian heathen a hundred and fifty years ago and that no young lady of thirteen or fourteen with Me'cy Hopewell 's name and her blood in her veins would tear into the house like a young savage or a western tornado . Now Chancey had to straighten his shoulders and turn his toes out . " You favor your great-grandfather , John Elliot , " she told him . " He had a brilliant mind . I often heard my mother say he was one of the most fearless speakers in Massachusetts . He would have made his mark if his country had n't lost him at Bunker Hill . " Oh , Huldah called her Lady Washington behind her back , and Libby dubbed her The Old Family Tree . " Your mother tells me your husband is a young physician , " she said to Libby . " I want you to bring him over . I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin Henry Wheeler was one of the most skilled and belovedmedical practitioners in New England . " Sooth 's eyes watered with pleasure when she heard that 232she got her musical talent from Sarah Elliot who once sang for President and Mrs. John Adams , which was much better than from Aunt Genny out here in Ohio . And no matterhow little Resolve cared that he looked like his great uncle , General Ezra Norris , he was glad to have a general in his family to set up against Fay 's papa . Mrs. Morrison and the girls looked up to Aunt Cornelia , and listened impressedto her stories about the Norris houses , the Elliot brains and the Hopewell silver . Now the Wheeler silver was n't so much , but no family ever did so much for the town of Quinham near Boston as the Wheelers . Aunt Cornelia stayed for a month and , even though she hardly raised her hands to do a tap , Sayward would n't have minded having her all summer . She was better than a watch dog on the children . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd tap sharply on the window pane with her finger ring , and when they came in , they better speak the king 's English , or she 'd set them straight . " It 's chest , " she would say sternly . " Do n't let me hear you say chist again . And it 's not banch . It 's not shumac or sassafrac , or pepmint or leevah . Now say them with me . Bench ! Sumach ! Sassafras ! Peppehmint ! Leveh ! And it 's not camphire . It 's c-a-m-p-h-o-r , camphaw ! " Sayward felt beholden to her for that and for telling them about their father 's side of the house . Why , till it was over she her own self knew more about Portius 's folks than her own . She could tell her grandchildren that had n't been born yet about Halbert , the queer old Wheeler coachman who claimed that one of his horses died coming down the Quinham hill but he held him up with the lines till he got to the bottom ; about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much that he had its hide tanned when it died and used it as a rug on the floor ; and aboutp 233their great granduncle or cousin Norris who wore silver shillings for coat buttons and eleven penny bits for buttons on his waistcoat and breeches . Oh , most everything Corneliatold about Portius 's folks was good . It could be lively or racy or amusing , but it ever made out the Wheelers and Elliots ladies and gentlemen of high degree . Now why did her father have to come the very last afternoon Cornelia was here , and make the Lucketts look like fly-up-the-cricks ? Why , all spring and early summer he would n't stir his stumps to Sayward 's for a meal or visit . He claimed his joints plagued him . Even Genny herself stayed away during Cornelia 's visit save when specially invited , and then she sat shut-mouthed and uneasy , not wanting to make any slips that would lower her and Sayward 's side of the house in front of Portius 's fine sister . One more day and Cornelia would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Worth have to come and show himself , looking like an old bushnipple . It was pretty well along in the afternoon . Cornelia had been across the square in the court house to see her brother sit on the bench in his robes and hear her nephew plead the case of a farmer ejected from a place that had been sold . When court adjourned , Portius came straight home , it beingCornelia 's last afternoon . Resolve dropped in , too . They got in a warm and lively argument , and Sayward felt it was good as court sitting there in the library a listening . In another minute , she told herself , she 'd have to start supper and get Worth 's basket ready . But first she 'd listen to Corneliatelling Resolve right out she did n't think much of him taking the case of a man who had no honest right to stay on a place . " That 's what all the clever and smart lawyers do , " she said , " take the side against an ejectment because sympathyp 234is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of justice sometimes . This time the poor and ragged was clearly in the wrong . " Just then somebody rapped on the back door , and Massey ran to answer it . Looking up , when Massey returned to the hall Sayward could see her startled face . Saywardrose and when she got to the kitchen , there was Worth in britches like a pair of feed bags . He had on no coat , only an open buckskin vest with the hair on it and under that an old red flannel shirt . White stubble covered his chin and cheeks , yellowed with tobacco juice around the mouth . " Do you want to come in the library , pappy ? " she asked quiet and steady as she could . " I do n't care , " he said , meaning he would . Sayward might be bamfoozled a little but not beat out . She had n't lived fifty-five years without learning that the old can be mighty shrewd and knowing sometimes , and contrary as a mule . Whatever you do n't expect them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just the same , your father is your father , and the more helpless and childish he is , the more he needs your help as you needed his when you were little and helpless . Resolve 's face was a picture when she brought Worth in the library with his hat on . Chancey went out one door as his grandpappy came in the other . " I want to make you acquainted with Portius 's sister , " Sayward spoke , raising her voice a little so he would surely hear . " Cornelia , this is my father . Will you take a chair , pappy , and rest yourself ? " " I 'll have to go directly . But I 'll sit down for a lick , " he agreed like he was doing Sayward a favor . His bright old eyes ran from one to another , to everybody save Portius'sp 235sister , and by that Sayward knew he was well aware that she was there , and that 's why he came , to get a look at the visitor before she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chair and the devil was in his eyes . You could tell he was going to enjoy this , and Saywarddid n't thank him for it . " You see before you the original pioneer of Shawanee county , Cornelia , " he said in his deep court voice . " Mr. Luckett 's the first settler and founder of Americus . " His sister sat there on her comfortable chair , not knowing what to make of this ancient " critter " crouching on the edge of a straight chair , his hat pushed back on his head , as a concession to etiquette . Oh , Sayward could have lifted off that hat before letting him in , but hardly would he have forgiven the indignity , and less would she have forgiven herself for trying to make him something he was n't . What went on now behind Cornelia 's stout prim face , Sayward could not tell save that she was company in her sister-inlaw'shouse , and no matter what he looked like , she would be civil to her sister-in-law 's father . " Americus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she pronounced . " What fer ? " Worth asked suspiciously , looking at her direct for almost the first time . " Judge Wheeler just told us . For founding such a growingcity in a new land . " " I had no idee o ' that , " Worth told her tartly . " Or I 'd never settled here . " " You are too modest about the good you 've done , " Corneliarebuked him mildly . " When you came here , there must have been nothing but a formidable wilderness . Todaythe country is developed and the people civilized and benefited . " p 236 " I 'd say it 's plumb the other way round , " he said flatly . " The country 's spoilt and folks are gettin ' less account every day . If you 'd a been here forty , fifty year ago , you 'd know it 's gospel . God Almighty made this country the way He wanted , and he never laid any out purtier . He stocked it with game outa the ark and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place the bucks would come so thick to rub off their horns in the spring , it looked like the deer park I heerd my grandpap tell about in the old country . You 'd run into bear or painters most any place . Mink and fisher fox traveled the runs . I seed squirrels thick in the trees as pigeons . You ever hear a gray moose call , ma'am ? That 's something to stir up your liver . He 's a callin ' to his lady love so they kin get together and multiply like the Good Book says . You would n't soon forget it . But this town scum never heerd it and never will . They stick in one place . They go through the whole rumpus of gettin ' born and dyin ' and have no idee how the Lord Almighty meant them to live . Moughty few ever heerd gabby birds a talkin ' . They 'd sooner wear them on their hats , the purtiest birds you ever laid eyes on . A kind of poll parrot , not very big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue with them . They 'd talk to each other like humans . They 'd talk to the beaver and otter , too , and warn ' em . One time I was watchin ' a family of otter . It was up on Crazy Crick near as I kin make out , where a fullin ' mill stands now . You kai n't shoot otter in the water or they 'll sink and you kai n't get ' em , but I could a shot these many a time up on them rocks . A course it was summer and their skins was n't much good anyways . But them otter played together like humans . Then they 'd sit on the rocks a watchin ' for fish . When they saw one , they 'd tell which one had to go in for it . You 'd reckon they 'd jump in doggy-fashion , but they'dp 237peel in that water slick as an eel . Oh , they would n't catch a fish every time , specially not the young ones . But when they did , they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked clean as a human . " That was up on Crazy Crick , and not far from them rocks I used to keep track of a drone beaver . You know what a drone beaver is ? Well , the rest drive him out because he wo n't work . He 'd dug hisself a hole in the bank and lived there all alone . Just cut down enough trees to eat . He did n't have no house and no woman . The rest would n't let him . I used to feel kinda sorry for the old varmintand never shot him , but likely somebody else did . He was an ole bachelor , you might say , a pore ole hermit . Me and him got mighty friendly , though what happened to him after I pulled out , 1 kai n't tell you . I stayed only so long as it was God 's country . " " But there were no people ! " Portius 's sister from the Bay State protested . " Thank God Almighty , no ! " Worth said fervently . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dainty town bodies a done in the woods ? They 'd a starved to death . Oh , we was n't plumb alone . We had friends to visit when we got lonesome . They was some around , scattered here and yonder . Whiteskinnedand red-skinned both . I do n't know to this day which was the best . I 've been took in by both and give shelterand rations . Once when I had lung fever and bloody flux , a Delyware woman nursed me kinder than my own woman could . Another time when I was a small tyke , I played with Injun boys . You know where the Suskyhanny is ? You crossed it when you come West . Well , right up the West Branch where Deep Crick came in , they used to be a Delyware town . Them was the boys I used to play with. p 238One time I was wrasslin ' and fell off a high cliff up the crick . The water hit me purty hard and I sunk in a deep hole . I knew whar I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ! I could n't move a finger . Once I laid on the bottom it seemed like I could breathe again good as anybody . If this was dyin ' , I tole myself , it was n't so bad . Next thing I knew I was out on the bank over a log . Them Injun boys had got me out and were runnin ' the water outa me . Best friends I ever had . They built a fire and dried my shirt and britches , and I never had dare tell their mams or paps I fell in or they 'd all got jesse for near drownin ' me . " Sayward looked up . She thought she heard the back door open . Genny stood there . She must have been trailing Worth . " I was just going by , " she apologized . " Father , I 'm goinghome . Do n't you want to go along ? " " Where are them good Delyware , Shawanee and Wyndottefolks now ? " Worth went on , paying Genny no attention , especially that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run off . Pushed one place , then another . Now they want to move them over the Mississippi . What fer ? To give their land to men who had n't the guts to come out in the first place . That 's the kind that 's mostly got it now . And what do they want with it ? Why , they want to make it just like the country they left back East . Already they 've put in flour mills and wool mills and saw mills and fullin ' mills and all kinds of mills . Any old thing with wheels that water 'll turn ! " He was hollering now . " Money , that 's what they 're crazy about . Money ! A cabin 's not good enough any more . They have to have a mansion house like this . A bag of meal used to make a whole family feel good . Now it do n't mean nothin ' . Folks must live high these days and dress fancy  --  make their selves believe they 're more thanp 239they are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them but have to ride their selves around with hosses and fancy riggin ' . At home they sit on their porch stoop or behind their window light and watch folks with nothin ' more to do than their selves . Now when we come out , we did n't have no hosses . We had nobody pushin ' us on a boat or drivin ' us packed like chestnuts in a bur . We came on our own legs and toted our plunder on our backs . " " Father , it 's time to go home , " Genny said sharply . " He 's all right here , Genny , " Sayward told her . " I knew a woman done something for money once , " Worth went on . " It never brought her any good either . She was one of these fine town bodies back in Pennsylvany . Her man owned three farms and a good house and stable in town . They had a smart boy , just a little feller , and his pap took him along one day in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Mingoes shot him and took the boy . Well , his woman got the house and stable and half the farms but she was n't satisfied . She wanted the half that was willed to the boy . When my old Colonel got all them Injun prisoners , that woman come to Carlisle lookin ' for her boy . He was n't ' ar . She could easy tell him . He had a birthmark like a berry by the nipple of his right breast . But she would n't give up . She wanted the other half of those farms they were holdin ' for him . So she took a boy nobody claimed . Swore that was her boy and took him home , though everybody back ' ar knew he was n't . Well , he grew up ugly and loose . He was n't satisfied with his share when he got old enough . He went through that and then started on her share . He ran through everything she had . He even ran through her rings and household stuff . I heerd she died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could have told him sure by thatp 240mark near the nipple of his right breast . It looked so much like a strawberry you could almost pick it off and eat it , they said . That 's how natural it looked . " " Pappy , I 'm a goin ' , " Genny said , losing patience and forgetting herself . " That woman was about the run of folks back East , " Worth declared . " This was in Pennsylvany but it could a been in Jersey or the Bay State where you come from . They 're never satisfied . When they come out here , they have to make God 's country over . So they make it like the place they left . Before they come , a man 's house out here was open to all that came . He took you in and gave you a bed if he had one to spare . If not , you could make a pallet on the floor . His woman gave you supper when you come and breakfast before you went , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show me a town body here or back in the Bay State who 'll do that for you . The best folks come out here at the start , if they was n't here already . They was all man and woman , I kin tell you . Them that come after or stayed behind were second raters . They were faint-hearted , weakleggedor money grubbing , and it 's good they never come early . They could n't have stood the gaff . They 'd a starved or been scared to death . I been around , and I kin tell you . I been in the piney woods where they have runs with the purest water and yet trees die without nobody knowing why . I been out on the prairies of Ioway where horses and cattle do n't need to be stabled but feed out all year on grammer and buffaler grass . I been in the mountings and in the Spanish settlements , and I 'm a telling you  --  " " You 're talking too much , Pap ! " Genny broke in angrily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll lay a plate for him here , Genny , " Sayward said . " It will save me sending his basket down . " p 241Worth got up from his chair pretty quick then . " No , I got to go . Well , come on , Ginny , if you 're a comin ' . " Dezia 's face was a picture of relief and Genny 's a foretasteof what she would say to him on the way home . But Portius 's bold features only showed regret that the show was over . As for Sayward , she did n't see why Genny got so worked up . Cornelia would understand that old men acted mighty strange sometimes . It was their nature . Just the same , it tickled her a little how he jumped on Cornelia and her town folks . She never saw him so stuck up and proud . Why , he carried on like him and his kind were kings of creation and town folks the ragtag bobtail and small fry . Now who was the blue stocking , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another thing . Tomorrow Cornelia 's visit would be over . All this time she had been here , and not a word of the trouble that made Portius leave home and hide out in Ohio . Was it a murder ? Or was it , as Sayward felt , a woman at the bottom ? For thirty-five years she had hankered to know . It used to torment her what this woman was like and did Portius still have a secret wish to go back to her ? When she heard that Portius 's sister was coming , she told herself she would find out . Cornelia would tell her , or at least drop some broad hint . Now Cornelia was going without having breathed a word . Sayward knew one thing . Whatever had happened way back yonder , it had n't set Portius or the Wheelers up any , and that 's why Cornelia kept still . Of course , Sayward could come right out and ask her before she went . But she had n't seen fit to ask Portius whom she lived with all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowed ? Now was n't it strange that itp 243did n't bother her so much any more ? Her children , her grandchildren and herself had got this far without knowing . Whatever it was Portius had done back there , it could n't hurt them any more . If it still came to her unbesoughtin some way , let it come . But if it did n't , she reckoned she could go to her grave ignorant and unawares. p 243RoSA was glad that her mother had three friends . The finest was Mrs. Phillips who sent the books . She was ever too busy to come herself , and you could n't expect her to , for she was rich . Her house had a room for only books , and what would Rosa 's mother have done without them ? Then there was Mrs. Clocker next door . Virtually never a day passed without Mrs. Clocker waddling solicitously to the fence and rapping on the Tench window . How did Mrs. Tench feel today ? Well might she stay to her bed , for this was a cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe snow . Her lines were frozen stiff before daylight . Rosa 's mother listened but said little in return , and this together with Mrs. Clocker 's invariable manner toward her established in Rosa 's mind the fact that her mother was of a definitely higher social position than her neighbor . Mrs. Clocker never dared to come in either , save one time when Rosa 's mother lay on her bed as one dead . But whenp 244Rosa 's mother opened her eyes and saw her , Mrs. Clocker hastily beat a retreat . The third friend was Miss Bogardus , and that was she coming up the street right now . You could tell her a long ways off . She was housekeeper for old Mr. Millard who lived on the Square . Oh , she was no common housemaid , and when she tramped up Water Street , moving sedately by the slab fence , it seemed that a faded , slightly shabby but undeniable lady was coming to call on them . How old she was Rosa could n't guess . She seemed to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had pale blue eyes like the finest porcelain and brought with her a whole floating cloud of the past . She had known Rosa 's mother 's family in Philadelphia and liked to tell about Grandmother Bartram , a real lady of the Quaker faith , and what a pity that she had to die of lung fever before she was thirty . Miss Bogardus did n't come in the house either but came closest to it , calling only in mild weather when she sat on the porch in a chair that Rosa was told to fetch out for her . Here in plain view of everybody who went by she visited with Rosa 's mother who sat in the shadows just insidethe door , invisible from the street but everyone knew she was there . Looking at her now , Rosa could n't say that she liked Miss Bogardus , but she felt pleased and honored when she came . Just to see her settled on the porch and hear her thin positive voice telling of Rosa 's mother 's family in Philadelphia , of great-aunts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house furnishings and bric-a-brac , brought an invisible wave of respectability and peace to the girl , something so substantial she could almost lie on it and let it bear her among the scent of plush and carpets and dyes of the brick Bartram house with white scrubbed marble stepp 245in the City of Brotherly Love between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers . Already Rosa had sunk to the edge of the porch out of reach of her mother 's eyes . Here she waited , letting her mind and body subside to that certain relaxed , almost limp , state in which Miss Bogardus 's words could levitate and transport her . But all the time while she floated and hovered , a part of her waited for the high point of the visit when for some mysterious reason Miss Bogardus and her mother invariably wanted her to leave . At last Miss Bogardus turned her head and fixed her pale eyes on the girl . " Rosa , do n't you want to run out somewhere and play ? " Rosa did n't say anything , just sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb and fingers togetherone after the other softly . " Rosa ! " her mother ordered . " Go down and see if Mrs. Doan does n't have something for you to do . " But Rosa kept sitting there in her trance-like repose , and inside of her the anticipation rose . Miss Bogardus was getting ready to tell her mother about the Wheelers . Oh , her mother never asked a word or mentioned the Wheeler name , but she would sit there with such silent decorum and bitter dignity that sooner or later Miss Bogardus always came around to the Wheelers , and nearly always she ran them down . There was something peculiarly vindictive in her tone . She accused , although whom she accused and why , Rosa did not quite know . Her mother listened so pitilesslyand cruel . It fixed every word and scene in Rosa 's mind , such as the time a summer or two ago when Miss Bogardus talked about Libby Wheeler . " Who 'd have thought that big lump would ever get married ? Why most people thought she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ britches on her and few would have known the difference . Nobody ever saw her do anything but act the fool . She 'd play Ducks with the boys and throw rocks with them , tussle with them on the Square . I saw her knock boys down more than once . They yelled and carried on , but do you think that woman would come out of her house or even call from the window ! " ( That woman , Rosa had long since learned , was Judge Wheeler 's wife . ) " Now , would you believe it , Miss Libby 's changed ! Her breasts are filled out . Almost over night ! She does n't rip and tear any more . What that young doctor from Connecticut sees in her , I do n't know , but he started to court her and pretty quick they were married . Some say they had to get married , but you 'd think a doctor would know how to get around that . " The last time Miss Bogardus was here , she talked about Mrs. Holcomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Bogardus called her . " Well , it 's true , " she told . " She and the iron master could n't make a go of it . They 're parted for good , and it 's all her fault , everybody says . You know how she went out to his place years ago and tried to get him without a stitch of clothes on her shameless body ! Then after they were married , she had no use for him . They lived together like fighting cocks . You 'd think he 'd a made her lie in the bed she made , but he let her have her way , never lifted a hand in court against her . If there 'd been children , maybe it would be different , but she would n't bear him any . Now she 's going with that England man , George Seton . The one that brought in these English sawmills . They say he 'll be a lord some day if his older brother ever dies , and that 's what she 's after . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing a titled English lady ? I thoughtp 247it would disgust the iron master with the Wheelers . But I 've lost my respect for him . He still comes to the house , they say , and sits and talks to that woman and asks her advicejust as if she was still his mother-in-law ! " Miss Bogardus 's chief spite seemed directed toward " that woman . " She told with contempt how Judge Wheeler 's wife could n't read or write until her own children taught her , and even now any school child could read rings around her . " You can tell she was never used to anything . She wo n't have a maid in that big house but makes the girls help . She raises things in her vacant lots as if she was still on the farm . I do n't know where she gets that from , because her father is n't worth a whoop and never was . But to hear her , you 'd think he was a saint . She calls him Pappy , and it 's Pappy this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the house . He has to stay down in that shanty in Beagle 's boat yard , and she sends his supper down in a basket every day to make people believe she does something for her Pappy . " However , it was when Miss Bogardus talked about Judge Wheeler that Rosa felt the strangest , bitterest silence come over her mother . " You remember the little Canada man that killed one of the Clarks in Tateville ? He 's crazy as a loon . That 's why they did n't hang him . And dangerous , too . You might know , if he 's a murderer . But Judge Wheeler lets him out a while every day . Calls him his messenger . Lets him run his errands . Why , he goes all over the city some days , and could kill any of us , but Judge Wheeler claims he 's harmless . He lets him go in his own house and that woman feeds him at the kitchen table . I 'm scared of him . If you call him Crazy Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crazy but I 'm only simple . ' Can you imagine that ? It shows howp 248crazy he is . Of course , he sleeps in the jail house at night , but he could do a lot of damage in the daytime . It 's all Judge Wheeler 's doings , and if you ask me , I think he 's very high handed . Mr. Millard 's cousin was taking up a collection for that poor woman whose husband was drowned last month . She lives down near the basin . I know all about her , ' Judge Wheeler stopped him . She 's a poor widow with four children and takes in washing . I wo n't give her a cent . ' ' What do you mean ? ' Mr. Millard 's cousin asked , so surprised . Why wo n't you help her ? ' Because she 's good and virtuous , ' the judge told him . I never help that kind of person . There 's a hundred other people that will . I help only the devil 's poor . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless that nobodyelse will give a hand to , come around and I 'll contribute . ' That 's exactly what he said . I heard Mr. Millard 's cousin say so myself . It 's lucky for him that judges are appointed and not elected or he would n't get a vote except from his devil 's poor . Now who would ever think that to see him walking down the street so noble and grand ? " She spoke as if Rosa 's mother went abroad in the city like other people . Rosa sat on the edge of the porch missing no word . She could see Judge Wheeler in her mind , going down the street , and that 's how he looked , noble and grand like Miss Bogardus said . Oh , he looked almost like God AlmightyHimself in a high hat and frock coat , his lion 's head sunken on his breast , his eyes looking neither to the right nor left . When he passed her , he would n't give her a glance . One time after he went by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're as good as he is , " he told her . " And you ought to be living in his house . " Now what had this man meant by such a saying , Rosap 249often wondered , but never for a moment could she dare to ask . One or two loafers must have heard what he said becausethat night her father came home , his face black to all save her . He called the boys in and took down his rifle . " I want to tell you young ' uns something , " he swore . " Rosa is your sister and this is where she belongs . In this house with me and her mam . Anybody that says different , I want you to tell me . I do n't care if it 's man , woman or child , I 'll fix him so he wo n't say it again . Like I 'm going to fix somebody tonight who talked too much . " Rosa looked quickly at her mother but nothing showed on her tired , olive , hawklike face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they never heard that he shot anybody . The boys thought he might have done it in the dead of night and thrown the body in the river , but Rosa prayed that the man who spoke to her got out of town . That was the first and last time anybody said such a thing to her . Sometimes her brothers would look at her with strange eyes , but that 's as far as they went . It did n't mean anything , she told herself . That man was likely just a Van Buren man mad at a Clay man like Judge Wheeler . But so long as she did n't actually know , she could always hoard the mysterioussecret in her breast . Whenever she heard the Wheeler name or saw one of the many Wheelers down town , a faint unexplained excitement rose in her and the man 's words came back to her ears . She kept those words in the shelteredshade of her heart . They would shrivel up if she brought them out in the light of day . Today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sit on the broken edge of the porch , with the empty stone jugs on one side and the sack of old rags on the other , with the trash and refuse and junk of the yard in front , and taste the scent and feeling of the Wheeler mansion housep 250all around her . Miss Bogardus was telling her mother today how judge Wheeler 's fine sister was visiting him now from the Bay State . In her mind Rosa could see her in her elegant gray taffeta like Miss Doan 's sister from Maryland wore whom Rosa never saw either . But Mrs. Doan had told her about her sister many times , and how she need n't lift a hand or foot , for she had a hundred slaves to do her bidding . Sitting here today with Miss Bogardus 's voice in her ear and the pictures of Judge Wheeler 's sister in her mind , Rosa thought , would n't it be wonderful if Mrs. Doan 's fine sister , Ellin , came to visit Mrs. Doan while Judge Wheeler'ssister was in Americus ! Likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met down on Market Street or High Street , Judge Wheeler 's sister would say how glad she was to see her friend out here in Ohio and would n't she come to dinner on Sunday ? " I can come and thank you , but I ca n't come without my sister , " Mrs. Doan 's sister would say . " Then bring her along by all means , " Judge Wheeler 's sister would tell her , for she knew that Mrs. Doan had been the finest milliner in all of the state of Maryland before she left . Then of a sudden on Saturday night Mrs. Doan 's sister , Ellin , would get sick and they 'd have to have the doctor . " Jenny , I 'm a sick woman and ca n't go to Judge Wheeler'ssister 's Sunday dinner tomorrow , " she would tell . " It 's too late to stop it now . You 'll have to go and take somebody in my place . " " Then I 'll take Rosa Tench , for she runs all my errands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she has a good eye , " Mrs. Doan would say . She would say nothing , however , about the rum she sentp 251Rosa for sometimes . No , not a word would she mention about that or how she would sit and stir brown sugar in it and sip it while her face got heavier and her nose got thicker and shorter till she looked like the Houcks ' pug dog sitting on a box . No , all she would do and say now with her sister , Ellin , visiting her was call a Gatchell boy across the street and send for Rosa . And Rosa would hurry down . " Rosa , you are the truest friend I have in Americus , " Mrs. Doan would say . " Will you go to the Wheelers ' mansionhouse to Sunday dinner with me tomorrow ? " " But I have no dress , Mrs. Doan , " Rosa would have to tell her . " Then I 'll make you one , " Mrs. Doan would say , and she 'd sew all night with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick that she could n't help with the needle . And next day after everybody was home from church , she would walk down town with Mrs. Doan in her fine dress for Sunday dinner , and everybody would see her , even Miss Bogardus from the Millard windows . And Judge Wheeler 's sister would look at her and say I am sorry my friend could n't come but glad that you are the one Mrs. Doan brought . And Rosa would sit in the dining room at the mahogany table and eat from china dishes with gold and pink flowers and put a solid silver fork to her mouth . And across the table , Judge Wheeler would have to look at her and say , did n't he see her some place before ? And after dinner she and Massey and Chancey could go out in the yard . " Rosa ! " a voice broke suddenly into her daydream . It sounded like her brother Turkey calling from down the street . " Rosa ! Mrs. Doan wants you ! " It was a shock as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now but inside she felt shaking . Was itp 252coming true like she had dreamed ? She went out of the gate , hurrying a little , a delicious knot in her breast . Down the street she could see the dirty little yellow Doan house with dirtier and darker doors and window frames . A little crowd was gathered on the vacant lot aside of the house . She must n't run , she told herself . If Mrs. Doan 's sister was there , she must n't see her do anything undignified . Then as she grew closer , the people on the lot moved so that she could see by them , and her legs did n't try to hurry any more . " No ! " she moaned to herself a little , but she knew it was true . It was the same old story . Between the people she could see Mrs. Doan 's short stout body lying on the ground . She must have got some money on a bill and was drunk again , lying out in the vacant lot under the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Doan ! " Mrs. Gatchell said , poking her . " You 're a disgrace lying out half naked in the day time . You 'll catch the distemper . " But Mrs. Doan lay quiet and peaceful , a small mountain of flesh on the ground , never bothering , one plump hand that could trim a hat so deftly lying open on a clump of grass . " Go away , " she murmured . " I am in my room in bed , I am sure . Go out now and shut the door . " " You 're drunk ! " Mrs. Gatchell bent down to her . She plucked up a fistful of stones . " Are these what you got in your house on your bed ? Look and tell me , Mrs. Doan ! " But Mrs. Doan lay in fine oblivion , letting the world go by , and that , Rosa thought , was proof that Mrs. Doan was really of high born stock , for nothing could disconcert or discommode her. p 253 " Go out of my house now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told them . " She 's drunk as a sow ! " Mrs. Gatchell said to any who would hear . " She 'll never listen to you , Rosa . " The name stirred life in the sluggish small mountain of flesh on the ground . " Rosa ! " it moaned . " It 's about time you came . Show these rude people out and lock the door . " The girl went up to her quietly . It was curious but seldomdid she feel shy or inferior with Mrs. Doan . Rather she felt like a poor but acknowledged relation . And sometimes as now like a worthy and equal relation . Even when Mrs. Doan was sober , at her best , skillfully trimming a bonnet , turning it in her hands to look at it this way and that , telling of the grandeurs of her sister 's life in Maryland , she treated Rosa like a special person . With Mrs. Doan , Rosa 's mother , family and house faded cleanly from her mind , and there was left only good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act and say what she wished when she was with Mrs. Doan . " They have a right to be here and I ca n't make them go , Mrs. Doan , " she said in a low voice . The bleary eyes opened and back in those round and swollen organs a distorted being regarded her like the misshapencreature that looked out at her from a pug 's pop eyes . " Are you going to tell me I 'm not in my own house and bed ! " she warned . " I would n't say that , Mrs. Doan . But I have to tell you you 're not in the right bed . If you get up now , I 'll help you back to your right bed , and then all these people ca n't see you and bother you any more . " p 254Grumbling and moaning and with great difficulty , Mrs. Doan worked herself up , bearing heavily on the small thirteenyear old girl . She had thought all the time she was n't in her right bed , she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody tell her ? Why did she have to wait all this humiliating while for Rosa to come ? She swayed on her feet like a tree with severed roots , pulling the girl this way and that . Her body stank like a whiskey barrel . Her hair had fallen completely down . No stranger , Rosa thought , would ever know her now as the finest milliner in all of Maryland . But through the puffy skin and soiled shift and disheveled hair , Rosa could still see with affection the one whose clever hands were the mistress of any bonnet and whose sister had a hundred slaves to wait on her hand and foot from morn till night and , if need be , again till morning . " We 're almost there , Mrs. Doan , " she encouraged her several times . The stupefied woman let the girl lead her to the gate and into the little yellow house with the dirty yellow doors and window casings. p 255 THE LAST month or two he lived , Worth gave Genny plenty of trouble . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't wear those new clothes we got for him . No , he holds like grim death to the old . He just does it for spite . He wants to keep me mending and patching , and make it look like we wo n't keep our own pappy looking decent in front of folks . Then he wo n't hardly eat what I cook him during the day . Nothing tastes good , he says . But when Will comes home late at night , he sticks his head out of the shanty . Will , fetch me something to eat ! ' he calls so loud the whole neighborhood can hear . You 'd think I half starved him . If it was me , I would n't take him out anything , but Will is fool enough to give him what he wants . " A month to the day that Portius 's sister went back home , Worth gave up and died . Genny cried at Sayward 's neck when she saw her . You 'd reckon Worth had been a wonderfulfather to her. p 256 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , drawing back and wiping her eyes . " I asked him early this morning what was he hungry for . He answered back like usual . Oh , nothing tasted good any more . But you know the way he liked brown flour gravy . I asked if he would n't like some of that . Well , that would taste as good as anything , he said . So I made him some flapjacks to put the gravy over , and some boiled cabbage and some of that sausage I still have away in lard . He ate pretty good for him . After dinner , I had no idea of anything . He just sat there at the table and flushed up a little . I asked if he did n't want to lay down . He said he did n't care , so he laid down on the settee in the kitchen . I should have knowed from that . Most times he would have no other way than go back to his cabin . But you know how contrary he 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed his feet . And that 's the last I knowed of him for a while . He did give a couple of snores and grunts , but he always did that . They sounded natural except they had a kind of rattle at the end . Mrs. Heberling was in the front room with me . She could look out through the kitchen door and said , I believe your pap 's dying . ' I looked right away and called Will to run for you and the doctor . But Pap give up before either of you got here . He died so nice and easy . Look at him . Did you ever see a nicer corpse ? You would n't think now to look at him what a trial he 's been to us all his life . " " I can see Wyitt in him for the first time , " Sayward mentioned . " I can see more of Achsa , " Genny said . " Especially around the mouth . " The neighbors gone , the sisters closed the door , rolled up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyke him out in the new clothes he 'd never consent top 257wear when alive . Now , how long had it been since she and Genny had done this thing for their mother ? It must be close to forty years . Was n't it strange that Worth , who never was good for very much , should have been blessed with such long life and that he should look sweeter in death than he ever had in his lifetime ? " Well , it 's a blessing to go quick , and we ought to be thankful if we 're ever that lucky , " Sayward mentioned . " He did n't go that quick , " Genny said . " He told me something before he went . I could hardly believe it . " Sayward looked sharply at her sister . Genny went on . " It 's good I was here . He opened his eyes and saw me standing over him . Then he told me . It was about Sulie . " " Sulie ! " Sayward echoed , her own Sulie coming first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Genny explained . " He found her . She 's still a living  --  out in Indiany . I said , Pap , are you sure ? ' and he said he lived at her house a while . Her name 's Harris . She has a good man and is good off , Pap said . He told me the name of the town , and Mrs. Heberling set it down . I do n't know if you can read it , her hand was trembling so , and I do n't know if it would do you any good if you could . " Sayward was never so beat out as by what Genny told her . So their youngest sister was still among the living ! Not once all these years had she ever buried Sulie in her mind . No , she clung to the thread that some Indians had found her . But hardly had she looked to have word from her after all this time . Even Portius was stirred up . Indeed the news that Sulie Luckett was still alive after almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Why , ever since they were old enough to be talked to , the childrenand grandchildren had heard the story of their Antp 258Sulie who got lost in the woods . The cows had come home and their Uncle Wyitt but never did she . A whole company of men had scoured the deep woods for days . All they found beside Indian signs were teeth marks on a spicewood twig , a red thread on a haw , a few small footprints in a sandy run and the bower she had made . Oh , the Wheeler children had heard plenty about that bower . Even the grandchildren could tell you what it was like , a little bitty house made from sticks , with a bark roof , a block of wood for a table and a piece from Sulie 's red dress for a table cloth . Just to see it , the men could tell a small girl had done this . Away back in the trackless wilderness , far from any human this little lost tyke had made herself a play house to mind herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother she never would see again or not for forty years anyway . Worth was buried a Thursday . On Friday Sayward sat down and wrote a letter to Mrs. Sulie Harris , Vinita , Indiana . If she was her sister , Sulie Luckett , lost in the woods and never found save perhaps by Indians , would she write back and tell her ? Their pap was dead and buried now , but his last words told about her . Would she like to know about her brother and sisters ? Wyitt and Ascha had left home and were never heard from again . But Genny lived here , Will Beagle was her man . Sayward herself was lawfullymarried , the mother of ten children and nine of them still living as far as she knew . Her married name was Wheeler . She did not say her man was a judge ; let her find that out in due course . Dezia could have written the letter in her fine backhand and saved her mother much labor , but Dezia would want to say everything grand like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sitting down with Sulie and talking to her . The letter filled one side ofp 259a foolscap till it was done . But though she looked anxiously to Chancey whenever he fetched the mail after that , no answer to her letter ever came . " If it 's our Sulie , why do you reckon she do n't answer ? " Genny asked her . " We let a mighty long time go by ourselves before we wrote her . We ca n't expect an answer right on the dot , " Sayward said , but she looked mighty grave when she said it . " Did you ever think , Saird , that Pap might a been a little out of his head before he passed on ? " " It could be , " Sayward admitted . " On the other hand , Portius told me about a man up in the Firelands who was crazy for thirty years , and just before he died , his mind turned good as yours or mine . I wish I could see my mother , ' he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I think it 's mighty strange Pap never said anything about Sulie all that while , " Genny complained . " It would n't be the first time he acted like that , " Sayward reminded her . " You ought to know the time we had no idea anybody was living in the woods besides us till just before Martha Covenhoven came a calling . Then Pap told us and went off hunting but he knew it all the time . No , this would be just like him as far as that 's concerned . " " It still seems funny to me . " " Then you got to recollect Sulie was a little tyke the last we knew her . Now we were a good bit older and would mind her better than she could us . But I 'd know her anywheres , and if I do n't hear anything by the middle of summer , I 'm going out . " " All the way out there ! " Genny said . " Well , if you 're really going , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to her or me and then think I passed up a chance to see our Sulie. " p 260They made out to go early in August . Sayward said she would take Massey and Chancey along . She did n't like leaving them back here alone with Dezia and Portius . It would be something for them to see the country and their Ant Sulie . Besides , Will , being in the boat trade , got such low rates it was cheaper to take them along than leave them behind . They left Americus on a fine morning with the sun not yet high enough to be hot and a good-sized bunch of relationsand friends down to the basin to see them off . Portiusand Will stood on the wharf holding up their hats , and little Resolve kept waving till Dyke 's warehouse shut them off from view . From the Sixth Street bridge curious folks looked down on them as they passed under . Genny wiped her eyes as the city fell behind them . Even Chancey looked a mite uncertain , but Sayward felt an anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going off where she could n't see all her children and grandchildren for five or six weeks . But how long had it been since she saw her baby sister ? Hardly had there been a rainy night all this time that she had n't thought of her and wondered what had happened to her that time in the woods so long ago . Could she still be among the living , she used to ask herself , and did she still say such grand and spunky things that minded them of their Grandmother Powelly back along the Conestoga . " Do you mind what she said that time we first looked over this country ? " Sayward asked . " I mind , " Genny nodded . " We were up on a hill . We could look over a hundred miles of country it seemed like . Woods , nothing but woods it was . I mind it good . She said  --  now what was it she said , Saird ? " " We mought even get rich and have shoes ! ' " Sayward told her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thatp 261seemed like a mighty rash and bold thing to say them days . We could n't see smoke from a single cabin . " " I wonder what she 's like now ! " Genny said . Sayward had been wondering the same . Sitting here on the quiet deck of the boat , keeping an eye on Massey and Chancey that they did n't fall in , she figured that Sulie must be going on fifty years old . They 'd have to remember she 'd be changed , Sayward told Genny . Likely she 'd be grander than either one of them , Genny agreed , with a ring on every finger but one , and three on that , for their pap said how she had a good man and was good off . She might even have a coach , for she was always one to do spunky things . Whether she had any young ones or not , pap did n't say , but if she had , they would likely give Massey and Chancey a run to keep up with them . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoned it the prettiest country she ever saw . The canal ahead looked like it would run head on into a handsome wooded hill . But when they got there , they found the water turning against the hill till a gap opened up where it could go through , and there was the town with rows of stone and log cabins , some fine white and yellow clapboard houses and a stone mansion house with a great stone stable , while across the canal and river lay the smooth green banks and meadows of a fine gentleman 's farm with the big house , farm house , barn and out buildings all painted to match , of pale green with brown narrow strips where at regular intervalsstrips of wood went up and down closing the cracks . It made a wonderful sight , like some place in old England , and all of them admired it together with the fat stock grazingin soft fields that had n't a weed in them . " That could be her place , " Genny whispered . " You know what Pap said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smooth stone work of the basin , an old boatman standing there said Mrs. Sulie Harris lived on the far side of town . Sayward thought that he and the men hanging around the basin looked at her a little strange . They were shorter spoken , too , than most men on the trip . When she looked back , she saw them all standing where she left them , looking after . Genny said she guessed they made a sight tramping up the middle of the road carrying their own traps , two women and two young ones all the way from Ohio without a man . She said it looked like a poor way to go visiting a sister who was well-off . She thought perhaps they should hire a carriage . But Sayward said it felt good to get their feet on the ground . They had been cooped up on the boat too long , and could tramp a mile or two without it hurting them any . There was no house to ask at for a good ways save a log cabin standing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked dark from weather . The ground lay tramped hard and bare around it . On this side stood a cleared patch of corn . " I declare I never saw such poor and scrubby corn , " Genny said . " But maybe they could tell us how to go . " As they came abreast of the cabin , a pack of dogs rushed out . Sayward picked up a stout club and they stayed their distance barking and carrying on . A dark-faced boy about sixteen came out hollering at them with strange words . When he saw the four strangers in the road , he stopped . Genny called shrilly above the hullabaloo . " Can you tell us how to get to the Harris place ? " The boy stood stock still , never saying back a word . After a little , he turned and went into the cabin . " He do n't know nothing . He 's Injun , " Genny said . They had started on when a man still older than Saywardp 263came out . He was dressed in pants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very straight , and with great deliberation . He spoke in the same language as the boy to the dogs and when one would n't obey him , he picked it up and threw it with such force against a tree that it ran yelpingpitifully into the cabin . As he came toward them , Saywardfelt the children move behind her . " We 're looking for the Harris place , " she told him . " Him live here , " the Indian said . " My name Harris . " There was dead silence for a moment . " It must be some mistake , " Genny put in lordly . " We 're looking for Mrs. Sulie Harris . " " Him my woman , " he said . Sayward saw Genny draw back as if he had hit her . She felt Massey and Chancey push up against her and freeze . She waited a little , gathering her thought , setting her face . " Can we see her ? " she asked friendly . " Sure . Him in house . " He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the time and indifference in the world . Sayward started toward the cabin . " Saird ! " Genny begged , holding fast to her arm . " This ca n't be our Sulie ? " " That 's what I want to find out , " Sayward declared . She had come this far . Nothing was going to stop her now . " If it was Sulie , she 'd be out , " Genny stammered . " She 'd hear us . She 'd come to the door . " " She might want to fix up a little first , " Sayward said . But when she got to the door , she found no sign that anyone had tried to redd up the cabin . The door stood wide open . Inside were neither chairs , table nor stools . A younger Indian woman with three small children sat on the hard earth floor . A younger Indian man and the boy stood onp 264the other side . At the fire with her back toward them , bent an older woman . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray cabin gown , was barefoot , her feet and legs brown . Her back remained toward the door as if she were deaf , and yet something passed over Sayward when she saw her . With the dogs baring their teeth and snarling at her , Sayward stepped unbidden into the cabin . " We 're looking for Mrs. Sulie Harris , " she said . The older woman made no movement . Not till one of the younger Indians said something to her in the Delaware language did she turn around , and then aversely . Her face was brown as her feet , wrinkled , the face of an older squaw , and yet Sayward saw something in it of her own GrandmamPowelly she had seen as a girl back along the Conestogain Pennsylvania . It shook her to her bones . " Sulie ! " she said starting toward her , but such a hard implacable look came into the woman 's black Indian eyes that it stopped her . " Was n't your name Sulie Luckett when you were a young one ? " Sayward stammered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without feeling . " But when you were a little tyke , did n't you have a familyby name of Luckett ? Back in Pennsylvania ? Then you all went to Northwest Territory . Did n't you go out with the cows and get lost in the woods and never lay eyes on your folks again ? " " No remember . " " Try to recollect ! " Sayward begged her . " Ca n't you mind your mam and pap ? He was out here to see you not so long ago . Worth , his name was . Do n't you mind your brother Wyitt and your sisters Achsa , Genny and Saird that used to live with you in that cabin ? Well , if you do , I 'm your sister , Saird , and out there 's Genny . Do n't you mind us now ? " p 265 " No . Me Indian , " she said stolidly . She was lying , Sayward told herself . Genny and the younger ones were watching from the door . Massey and Chancey turned piteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Massey whispered . " Genny , maybe you 'd sing something for her ? " Saywardasked . " Something she used to know , like Fly Up . It might help her remember . " Genny looked shocked . Her face said she could n't do that , not here in front of Indians . Yet never had she refused Sayward anything , and in the end she gave in . She started very low , not even clearing her throat . It seemed at first she was only going to hum , then the song came out as of itself , like spring water rises from the ground . So clear and strong it sounded at last that it gave Sayward a turn to hear it . Haycocks in the meader , Cherries in the dish . Red bird , fly up , Give me my wish . Chestnuts in the tree top , Punkin in the dish . Brown bird , fly up , Give me my wish . Ice in the river . Possum in the dish , Snow bird , fly up , Give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dish . Blue bird , fly up , Give me my wish. p 266How many times , Sayward thought , had they heard that in the old days ? Till Genny was half ways through , it seemed like they were back in the woods with their mam still living , and Achsa and Wyitt still at home . It was almost like this was her pap 's cabin and Sulie was a little tyke still there with them . But when the song stopped and the spell broke , Sulie Harris 's eyes looked back at her with all the stoic relentlessnessof the savage as when you and he stare at each other across the uncrossable gulf . " It 's not her , " Genny said very low . " Or she 'd say some-thing . " Oh , what , Sayward thought , could Genny expect Sulie Harris to say ? How did she reckon her sister felt standing there in her bare feet and ragged dress , in her dirty Indian cabin with her dark Indian children and grandchildren around her ? Did Genny expect Sulie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their soft leather shoes and fine dresses , with elegant mits on their hands and bonnets with silken ribbons on their heads , with their own clean white children along and their white husbands at home ? What was that story pap used to tell of Janie Gosset who the Shawanees took from Buffalo Valley ? Years later , when her folks found her , she had an Indian family , and even though her Shawanee man was dead , she would n't go back . She would be a disgrace to her white people , she said . Her oldtime friends and relations would look down on her and her Indian young ones . No , it was too late now . Never could she go back and never could Sulie . They had taken up the Indian life , and that 's the life they had to live till they died . Sayward could n't look at Sulie now without her heart yearning toward her till she could hardly stand it . Gladlyp 267would she have done most anything to make it right , but what could she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way from Ohio for ? Is this what brave young hopes and spunkiness like Sulie 's came to in the end ? How far off that little tyke she used to know seemed now . Lost and alone in the woods , she had played cabin to remind her of her brother and sisters , but now that two of her sisters were here , she would n't give in that she knew them . One time she must have cried bitterly for them , but now she wished them far off and the biggest favor they could do her was not to claim any more that they were her sisters . Sulie Harris stared back at her without winking . After a while , she spoke in Delaware to the young Indian who was likely her boy . " She say , " he translated to Sayward , " you and her go . But leave young ones . Wait by road . By and by come out . " Genny looked alarmed , and Chancey and Massey begged their mother not to leave them but she cut them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sulie . She saw them wince at the word . Sayward herself spoke to Sulie Harris before she went , taking the cold impassive hand in both of hers . " I hope this wo n't be the last time I see you , Sulie . If you ever need anything , let me know . I 'll send it to you if I can . You got my address . If you ever get that way , stop and visit me . " But although Indians loved to visit , she felt that her sister Sulie never would . As they left , Sulie Harris spoke deep in her throat to the rest of her family . The latter followed them out reluctantly , leaving her alone inside with the white young ones . Sayward reckoned she would not soon forget Chancey'sfrightened face at the door when she went . The Indians moved off by themselves to the other side of the 268cabin . The older Indian man she could see down along the river . She and Genny event to the road . " Not a foot farther will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancey come out . " It seemed a mighty long time until they came running like deer from the cabin . Chancey looked pale and Massey was crying . " What did she do to you ? " Genny wanted to know right away . " She did n't do anything . She just stayed in there with us . After while she took Chancey 's hand and stroked it . She said how he minded her of somebody . " Sayward and Genny looked at each other . " Wyitt ! " they said together . " She did n't say Uncle Wyitt or any name , " Massey said . " She just stroked Chancey 's hand and said how white it was . And then she started to cry . It looked so terrible when she cried , I had to cry , too . " " And then what ? " " She stopped and asked what I was crying for . She threw Chancey 's hand down . She said white was a very bad color . She said white men were good in church but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians she said . But her man was always good and kind , she said . We should tell you he was always good and kind to her . He was a great soldier and killed lots of white men in battle . One time he scalped so many white men , his arm got tired . He was brave and not afraid to do what was right . More than once he burned white men at a fire he made himself . " Genny drew an expressive face to Sayward . " What else did she say ? " " That 's all . " " But you were in such a long time . " p 269 " She just stood most of the time looking at us . I could n't tell if she hated us or liked us . Then she gave us each something and said we could go . " Massey opened her hand and showed a silver shilling . " She had them in a little leather bag under her dress . I saw her reach in and her skin in there was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , her face working . Genny put her handkerchief away . " I 'm going back and talk to her and try to do something for her , " she announced . " I would n't if I was you , Genny , " Sayward said gravely . " You know what Pap used to say , that a white person never does the Indians any good . He always tries to make a white person out of them . Pap said he never knew a single Indian who made a good white person , though he knew plenty whites who made good Indians . " " Well , I do n't believe it that strong , " Genny said . " I feel terrible sorry for her if you do n't . I did n't think it was really her when we were in there with her . Now I 'm going back and talk to her and see what I can do . Anyway I can give her goodby when I leave and tell her I hope we 'll meet in heaven . " Sayward and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned . She would n't talk about it until they were some distance back to town . " She acted queer again like she was at first , " she said grimly . " She would n't even talk till I made her . Then she said right out she did n't know us . Said her name never was Luckett . Claimed she never seen us before . I tried to talk to her like a sister , and she told me to clear out or she 'd sic the dogs on us . " Sayward said nothing . Her face felt weary and benumbed . She should never have left Genny go back . Howp 270she hated now turning away from her own flesh and blood sister , leaving her behind in that poor cabin while she set out for another state and a mansion house . She tried to tell herself it was n't so bad as she and Genny felt . She reminded herself of what pap used to say that white folks liked to think their life the only way and that any savage ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , he used to tell them , none of those white prisoners his old colonel took from the Indians ever thanked him for giving them back to their white folks . Most of them , he said , fought like cats and dogs to stay with their Indian step-mammies and pappies . Even when they got home , some ran off to lead the Indian life again . That was the way to look at it , Sayward told herself . Sulie might have had a hard life , but it was better than if she had died that time in the woods and been put under ground . She had grown up and tasted life . She knew what it meant to give birth to young ones , to nurse and watch them a growing . She had a cabin , a man and family of her own . It might n't look like much of a life to white folks , but you had to take life as it was and not as you wished you had it . Just the same , all the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back to Sayward 's mind . Grandmam MacWhirter , long dead and buried , had said it , the time that poor little Sulie was lost . " Sometimes it 's a good thing if you do n't find a lost young ' un , " she had said . " I 'd as soon see them dead and buried . " p 271Now what was the matter with her , Sayward asked herselfwhen she got back home . She had n't felt so bad since Portius ran around with that other woman . Even then she did n't know as she was so short-tempered , sharpspokenand mean . Nothing suited her any more . She should have thanked the Lord every night for getting her back safe and sound and having a decent home to come to . On the whole trip she had n't seen a house she 'd want to trade for hers . What was that old saying , " Travel north , south , east , west  --  home 's best . " That was a true saying . And yet here she was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . Americuswas getting too big for its britches , she complained . Why , the numbered streets ran high as Fourteenth already , and some were talking of them going to twenty . The town was n't satisfied with milling , blacksmithing and wheel-p 272wrighting any more but had to brag now about its new soap works that packed pork and beef , its looking-glass works that made combs out of cows ' horns , and a cotton factory with a thousand spindles and looms . There were so many different mills and works that the race could n't turn all the wheels . The Centinel came around every day but Sunday . Nobody but an idle person had time to read it any more . Down on Water Street the Grand Central Hotel had fixed itself up like Babylon with carpets all through , and the Mechanics Society had started telling plant and shop owners what they could do and could n't . " Do n't mind her , " she heard Genny tell Dezia . " It 's findingyour Ant Sulie that way that done it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . " Sayward never let on that she heard . It was n't Sulie , she felt , but the pride and greed and great shakes of these town bodies that bothered her . Nothing was good enough for them any more . Twice had her own church been rebuilt during her life time and still they had to make it bigger , with a new steeple so high no workman for less than four dollars a day would risk his neck on it . The selectmen were n't satisfied any more with fire ladders in the market house and fire buckets of harness leather with the householders ' names painted on them . No , they had to send for a Philadelphia fire engine and fetch it all the way around by New Orleans . This engine had a water tank you filled with buckets and a crank to pump it out . Oh , fighting Demon Fire was a good thing , and Sayward stood high on the subscription list for both ladders and engine . But even this grand new engine did n't suit them long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up water from a well or cistern . They called it the Neptune , and another company was starting the Vigilance. p 273That was n't half of it . Merchants were spoiling the Square , buying up houses and making them over into shops . They even tried to buy the old cemetery and put up a new bank and hardware store on the graves . Nothing could stop progress , they said , not even " Mrs. Wheeler 's mother 's bones . " Sayward bowed up her back at that . She told what she thought to Portius who let fly a speech about disturbingthe last resting place of the pioneers , and that put an end to it . But some of the business men were so mad at her , they complained bitterly about her holding on to her lots for raising truck . Land so close in was needed for business to give men a chance to work , they said . " Why do n't they say it to my face ? " she complained to Portius . " Then I could give them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all my land now . I ca n't see the country any more . Every way you look , you 're stopped by their sawed boards or else their brick and stone . " The old order had changed , she told herself . The world she knew was going . About the only thing left around town was the ancient sugar maple half way across the square . It was n't much of a tree any more and had n't been for a good while . Once it had given copiously of syrup . Sayward herself had pounded spiles in the butt . Of late years it had been going down hill . The butt had a hollow place big enough for a good-sized bear to hide in . Every winter more limbs had broken off . The crown was dead , and the only green part left was its middle . But that tree had seen her pappy when first he came to this country , and the rest of them as well . Then one night in October it stormed , and when she got up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butt had broken off at the hollow place , and what leaves it had lay yellow and mud-spattered on the ground. p 274 " The great god , Pan , is dead ! " Portius said when he got up and saw it . Well , it was about time that it came down , Sayward told herself . Before it fell on somebody . She would n't want to see it maim one of those young ones always playing around it . Funny how they seemed drawn to that old tree . Just the same she did n't sleep so good that night . When she woke up from a nap at daylight , she had the strange notion she lacked something . Now how could you miss something that you never did have ? She lay there listeningbut could n't hear anything . When she got up , she looked around the room . Now how could you expect to see or hear anything when you did n't know what it was you looked and listened for ? The only thing missing when she went to the window was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Square . Already it had been half cut up by Cherry Alley householders . It could n't be that old tree lying on the ground that bothered her , she told herself . Why , all her life she had hugged herself to see a tree come down . It meant you could see the sun and stars a little better . A mite more light and air could come in . A few more stalks of corn could grow and give meal to hungry young mouths . Why , back in the woods , she and every other settler woman hated the trees like poison . They were your mortal enemy . All your life you had to fight them , chop , split , nigger them off till nothing was left . And then their wild sprouts kept comingup to plague you . Even now long after the trees were gone , the big butts still lived on in your joints . Heavy liftingand rolling had thickened them till you sometimes felt like an old tree walking . That afternoon from the third floor she looked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the wholep 275city hardly a tree could her eyes find . She knew it had some lilac , apple and peach trees tucked away here and yonder in side and back yards , but they were puny , of no account , could hide behind outhouses . Hardly one could she see from here . The city looked all red brick and wood . Now where had she seen such a city before ? Then she knew . This was the city she had dreamt about that time long ago in the wilderness , a city of red brick and white wooden church steeples and never a tree in sight . She had thought it then a wonderful sight to see , a place free of the lonesome gloom of the deep woods , and nary a big butt to have to cut down and burn up . But she did n't know how much she liked it now . It minded her a little today of one of those desert places her father told them about , of red rocks and sand and far as you could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help thinking of some of the trees they had seen on the trip to Indiana . Not the kind she had known in the woods , standing thick as thieves with their heads togetherplotting against humans . No , these big butts of the countryside seemed of a different and kindlier breed , standing in open places , free to spread out on all sides , a whole woods of leaves and limbs hanging on a single trunk . One big basswood she recollected especially . They had seen it first a long ways off across the fields . As they approachedit grew taller and broader like the daddy of all the big butts , rising half way to the sky and spreading out like a monster umbrella over canal , tow path and locktender'shouse . It was a hot day in the sun but when the boat came under the shade , it felt cool , fresh and green like when she was a girl in the deep woods , only this was n't somethingfierce but tame and beneficent to man . She noticed it again when they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All were on deck to see the sun going down and the moon coming up . They had to wait for anotherboat to pass through the locks , and then one of the gates had to be patched up . All the time she sat there listening to the soft wind in the big basswood . It stirred like something alive . It was immense and powerful , yet gentle as a woman holding its great arms over water and land , boats and locks , the lock tender 's cottage and his children . Now why did she think all her life that trees were savage and cruel ? Or were they wild in the woods when she was young , and now in the peaceful countryside did they grow tame and sweeter-natured ? Or did she make up all this in her mind ? Could the leopard change his spots ? Maybe she was just homesick for when she was young . All winter she looked at the naked city and square . When the ground first thawed in the early spring , she put a mattox , shovel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her into the country . They crossed the canal on the Sixth Street bridge and drove up the hill . They had to go a long ways before they found what she was after . Once all this country had been thick woods where she and Mao-eelMacMahon would walk their bounds . Now there were so many houses she could n't tell any more where her land had ended and Mageel 's began . She could n't even see Mageel 's house and barn . Far out beyond where Guerdon lost his finger , they came on a patch of brush and secondgrowth . The farmer said he would n't mind her digging out a few whips . he was going to clear it for corn anyhow as soon as he was able . She picked out three young maples , a buckeye , a basswoodand a whitewood poplar . She wished she could bring home a pair of young oak trees , a white oak and a red , but hardly would they stir their stumps during the rest of herp 277lifetime . She also wished she could find an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old cabin , but she could n't tell a young one for sure , its leaves not yet sprouted . Every tree she and Chancey dug out stood higher and stouter than she did . They had to work a long time to get the roots whole and free , and to do them up in burlap sacks with some of their home soil for company in their new lodging place . They drove back to Americus with the long whips sticking out of the back of the chariot . She had no trouble with the farmer , but she had plenty with Chancey once she got to town . About all he was good for was holding up the tree while she spread the roots tenderly around and tromped the ground down . The basswood , the whitewood poplar and one of the maples she planted in her side yard , the buckeye and the other maples in front of her house . Until she finished , a small crowd of folk had gathered to watch . Where did she get them ? Did she think they would grow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her home town back East ? Why did n't she have the city councildo it for her ? Would n't horses and young ones break them down ? Well , she intended to have Clem Reeser build a cribbing about these two on the square . Small news traveled fast as big in Americus . It was too dark for Portius to have seen much of anything when he came home , but she could tell the minute he came in that he knew all about it . " I hear you 've been improving the property , " he mentioned . " Well , I do n't know if you 'd call it that , " she disallowed . " I was always under the distinct impression that you hated trees , " he said . Sayward went on silently with her work getting supperp 278on the table . Now how could she explain to him the reason why she had done this . She did n't altogether know it herselfyet , except that once a woodsy , always a woodsy . That might explain it . She saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were nearly done , she came around to it . " I was just sitting here thinking what Mrs. Kramer told me , " she said . " This was last summer the last time she came around with her berries . Their church out in Longswamp Valley burned down and old Miley Hoffman wanted to know when they were going to build it . You know old Miley , the one that 's such an infidel . They asked him , what did he care when they built it . He said he had a good reason . When he looked over from his fields he missed seeing the steeple . The valley did n't look right to him any more without a church . I guess I 'm like old Miley . The town does n't look right to me without any trees , especially not the square . " p 279HIS year the Tenches had to move . Their house , theClocker house on one side and the Singleton house on the other were all going to be torn down and cleaned out for a row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she heard the news . Never had she known their dark little box of a house to look golden as now that it had to die . Why , she had been born in that house . All her seventeen years had she lived in it . Of course six days a week she went to Mrs. Doan 's , trimming hats with ribbons and bird wings , sometimes taking finished bonnets to the houses of the ladies they were made for . But all the time , the little house by the river was home in her mind , and what would she have done without it and withouther mother sitting in the dim room waiting to ask her what had gone on at Mrs. Doan 's today. p 280And now the house was going to be pulled down . Alreadyit belonged to a strange man who cared nothing more about it than to destroy it . It gave her the same strange feeling as when her baby sister had died . It was the only sister she ever had . Rosa was just a little tyke at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up in a cold sweat over the dead baby . Nothing then would satisfyher save getting up and taking little Boicey out of the same cradle the baby had died in , making sure he was alive , and then rocking him soft , warm and living in her arms . Now evenings after work she hurried home decently as she might to spend all the time she could in the house while she still had it with its roof spreading over her and the four walls standing around her . She was small for her age and could run all the way home if she wanted to . Nobody save her mother would say aught against it . But her father swore he was glad to get out of " Higgins 's old house . " " It 's too far from the waterfront , " he said . He meant the new waterfront , the canal . " I have another place rented . It 's bigger than this with two rooms and a goin ' business in the front . Turkey kin tend it when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Rosa stayed home from work to help . Her mother was of small use . Ever since the news came , her mind seemed stopped like a clock . She sat like one , too , and you could tell no time from her face . Only the pendulum tassel on her old dress moved , and that faster than Rosa remembered . Sometimes the mat of hair she never let Rosa touch kept in time with the tassel , giving little tremors as if struck by an unseen hammer . On moving day morning she went helplessly from one thing to another . She 'd pick up this and could n't make up her mind what to do with it . So she 'd set it downp 281and pick up something else . That 's the way it went . Rosa and the boys had to do everything . The wagon came right after noon to load their stuff . Her father , the driver and the boys carried out the things . The inside of the house grew bare as a nut . Rosa had never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Mama , " she said . Across the street she could see a knot of folks waiting . Oh , she knew what they waited for . They wanted to get a look at her mother . Here 's where they 'd get to see Mrs. Tench at last . She had never come out of her house since her first child was born , but she 'd have to come out now . " Come on , Mama , " Rosa said and went out . But her mother did n't come , and her father and the boys made like they were n't ready to go anyway , rearranging the things in the wagon . Still she did n't come . " Go in and get her , " Rosa 's father told her . " She says she 'll come right away , " Rosa said when she came out . But " right away " passed and Jake went in . You could hear his loud voice outside . In the end he came out withouther . " Kin you wait a little ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave her to hell behind , but she kai n't walk that fur . " The driver settled down on his haunches by the front wheel . His face , Rosa thought , did n't seem to have any expression . It was as if this whole business was something that happened long ago and had nothing to do with today . It was time out of mind , out of man 's control . The minutes went by as if they pulled hard against the grain . It seemed to Rosa they 'd never get away now , and here they 'd forever have to stay , out of the old house but stillp 282not in the new . The loafers licked their lips watching . The horses stood sleepy and willing . Rosa listened for the tick of the clock laid some place in the wagon , but it must have stopped , like everything else . The driver got up . " Well , I got to go , Jake , " he said and climbed up on the seat . His rough hairy hand picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama , he 's a goin ' ! " he shrilled . Not a sound or stir came from the house . The driver clicked to the horses . They woke from their drowsing . The wheels started to turn . The axles rattled in the hubs . The wagon creaked and lumbered . Then Rosa 's mother came hurrying out of the door . She had thrown her brown shawl over her head and shoulders . You could see only part of her face . She looked like a starved bird or fowl peering out of its feathers . Rosa was n't sure she 'd have known her own mother passing her on the street . She looked so different out here in the broad pitiless light of day . The wagon stopped to wait for her . Rosa ran to help her mother catch it . She and Turkey pushed her up over the wheel to the front seat where she pulled the brown shawl around her . The driver sat very still , not looking at her even when she sat up there beside him . Rosa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon . It reminded her of the baby 's funeral . That 's the way they had walked to the cemetery while the cart bumped along with the little coffin . But that had been winter time . Was n't it nice this spring the way so many folks were planting trees in the city ? Hardly anybody so poor that they could n't have one or two in front of their house . In twenty years the streets of Americus would be green with dancing leaves , but where would she be then ? p 283The wagon turned off Water Street at Sixth . Now why did the driver have to take their poor traps through the fine square ? Her mother would hate it if Miss Bogardus looked out and saw her friend go by on the seat of a moving van . Rosa hoped none of the ladies who bought their hats from Mrs. Doan would see her traipsing with her father and three brothers like country jakes moving to town . That great plastered white house was where Mrs. Stowe lived who had such a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it went by . Next door stood the striped brick mansion house of Judge Wheeler . Farther on the houses got poorer and smaller , one against the other , then big warehouses and little wooden houses stood together . You could smell the canal down here , with old bones from the soap works and hide scrapings from the tannery . From that brick corner Mr. Percy Yates , the Yankee , had bought all the anvils in Ohio and made a fortune , running up the price and letting his wife buy the handsomestbonnets Mrs. Doan could trim . Other rich men had places of business down here . They came only by day . In the evening they went back to their fine houses , but the people that lived here had to stay and breathe the bad smells all night when the smells got stronger and when the mills and warehouses stood dark and unfriendly on the street . Oh , it had been so open and free around their house by the river ! But that life was gone to her now . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man traveling by canal boat had been murdered . The boys would n't walk on the log house sidewalk but turned into the street . Next came a long stable smelling of canal mules . On beyond , the driver came to a halt in front of a faded red one-story house , hardly more than a shanty . A second shanty with a loft was attached to it in back . The frontp 284door stood fastened with a huge iron lock . Over the door letters had been painted in green on the red boards . THE RED MULERosa 's father took a muddy stone from the street and hammered on the lock till the catch gave . Then he threw the lock on the floor . The boys rushed to be the first in . Rosa followed slowly . She saw that the house had two rooms like her father said . But he had n't said everything . The front room was a rude barroom with an unpainted plank bar . An empty keg rested on one end of the plank . Behind on a shaky shelf stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like a house at all , Rosa thought , never like their house . The second room was little more of a place to live than the dark hollow of the sycamore shanty . Pieces of glass and pottery , lumps of mud and plaster , drifts of rubbishall lay on the floor . The sour barroom smell hung as strong in the back room as the front . Even the walls smelled of stale mead and bitters . Rosa wondered what her mother would say when she came in , but she only upbraided them bitterly for not bringing in her chair . When it came , she let herself down in it and sat blind to the swirling dust and dirt around her , deaf to the quarreling where to put this and that . She did n't even want to remember they had moved , Rosa thought . That 's the way she kept sitting when Jake and Turkey went out for wet goods , and after dark when the sound of heavy feet and rough voices in the front shook the back room , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshly opened beer and whiskey penetrated under the door and came through the cracks and broken panel . " Come on and go to bed , Mama , " Rosa said , " I have it all ready . " p 285But her mother would n't go to bed . Not till the ugly sounds from the front room had ceased and Rosa 's father came stumbling back , yawning and reeking of grog . Then Rosa 's mother flew into him . " You disgraced me ! " she accused . " You brought me down right by his house like any common person in a wagon ! " Rosa , who had n't slept a wink in the new house , ponderedher words . Now whose house was it her father had brought her mother by ? Was it Mr. Millard 's where Miss Bogardus kept house , or the gray stone house of Mr. Percy Yates ? Never had Rosa been in Mr. Millard 's or Mr. Yates ' houses , but once she had been in the old Wheeler cabin and once almost in the Wheeler mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a Wheeler bonnet was ready , Mrs. Doan took it herself . But this had been before Easter , and there were always too many bonnets for Mrs. Doan at Eastertide . She had to work half the night and drink gin to keep her awake in the day time . She was too unsteady on her feet to go to Judge Wheeler 's . So she said Rosa must take the bonnet , but not until late was it finished . If the Wheelers were in bed , Rosa should put it in the usual place , back in the privy in the box for paper . Then she must close the door tightly . The first one out there would find it on Easter morning . But there was still plenty of light in the Wheeler windowswhen Rosa got there . Shc went around the hack way . Miss Dezia herself with a candle in her hand came to the door . Something flew into her face when she saw Rosa . " I 'll take it , " she said , and snatched the bonnet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rosa hardly noticed at the moment . In that short space of time that the door was open , she could see like into the 286golden scene of one of Mrs. Phillips ' novels . It seemed her eyes could run through the whole house . Right before her lay the big wonderful kitchen with black kettles and shiningcopper pans , beyond that the dim dining room with the fearfully grand shape of a mahogany clawfoot sideboard . She had a glimpse into still another huge room with soft light streaming from it and deep tones of a piano , like the sound of water in a blue cavern . It was hardly more than a few moments that the door was open , not a bit longer than Miss Dezia could help , but Rosa had seen and heard everything . She could still see and hear it tonight lying on her bed in the back room of the Red Mule . It was plain as if she stood by the open Wheeler door this minute , and Miss Dezia gettingready to slam it on her . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Mrs. Bernd would hardly be there so late and plain old Mrs. Wheeler in her knitted cap could never make such beautiful music . But Miss Bogardus said that Master Chancey was lazy and good for nothing and that he liked to fool at the piano so he would n't have to do an honest day 's work. p 287CHANCEY did n't want to go to the Independence Day celebration in the first place , but he had no idea anythingwould happen to him there . He only knew he 'd feel like a lost sheep at the big gathering . He always did . Most everybody else enjoyed it with an energy and zest that weakened him just to see it . They would n't have missed it for the world . They arrived early and a wild light came into their eyes the minute they got there . They revelled in meeting old friends , in playing old games , in eating old-fashioned rations and talking and praisingold-fashioned customs in which , try as he might , Chanceycould see nothing except a harder way to live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they want to leave the brighter present for the dark and painful past ? Take today . The high light of the celebration was a cabin raising . There was utterly no use for it as far as Chancey could see . It was just to show the younger generationand especially city folks how they used to put up a house in the old days in the woods . They had to go to ap 288great deal of trouble for the event . Logs had to be bought far up the country , boated down the canal and hauled to the scene by ox team . No timber was left standing around Americus any more . The settlers and sawmill people had cut it all down . There was n't even a grove left to hold the celebration in , only patches of scrub overgrown with brush . So the last few years after decorating the graves , the people went to Brown 's pasture where the fairs and circusescame . The worst of it was that Chancey had to take part in the raising . There must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped at the chance . The troublewas , they did n't have Judge Wheeler for a father . All Chancey wanted was to be left alone , and yet he had to get right out in front of the crowd and help carry logs to the end men . The committee was a little simple-minded , Chancey thought . Indeed he felt sure all pioneers were more or less simple , almost like children . More than once he had noticed it in his mother . She could be hard as hickory denying him some small thing he wanted to do , but let somebody tell her a noble story of old times and water would be liable to run from her eye . Like the story she told of the boy in Dark County who had no boots . In the winter time he 'd warm two boards by the fire , run out in the snow and stand on them in his bare feet while he chopped firewood . Any grown-up moved by that story was a little pathetic , Chancey told himself , but then all pioneers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war veteransbrought in carriages and who now sat in a place of honor to review the cabin raising . It was hard to believe that these ancient and tottery old codgers had ever fought the British or Indians in the primeval forest . Why , theyp 289did n't look as if they could find their way in the woods , let alone outsmart war-whooping savages . Doddering , palsiedor half-blind , they sat on the platform like they hardly knew what was going on . When the veterans of 1812 fired a salute , Major Phillips , who was deaf as a post , got up and squeaked : " I kai n't hear your volley , men , but your powder smells good . " That was the kind of partner Chancey had the luck to draw for the raising , a little dried-up fellow named MacNulty , with bandy legs . He looked a hundred years old beside the boy . Youth and age , Chancey 's father , called them . He was master of ceremonies . " The first ox team will now stand at their yokes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men took their places where three handspikes had been laid on the ground and a log rolled on them . Chancey was at the last handspike . Ile reached down to take hold but he could hardly get his fingers under the iron , and when he tried to pull it up , it felt like his end had been spiked to the ground . He glanced over at Mr. MacNulty , but that little shriveled old man had his end up already , and no matter how Chancey heaved , Mr. MacNulty 's side stayed so much higher that the log kept sliding against the boy 's fingers . " Let me give you a little more handspike , boy , " the old man croaked . " No , sir , I got all I can carry now ! " Chancey shouted , to make his partner hear . The older settlers had a good laugh over that . " He 's got all the handspike he can carry now , " they said . " Your off-ox is a calf , Judge ! " a Tateville democrat bellowed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his share from then on . He vowed he 'd raise his end if it tore him apart inside . If that little old dried-up runt with one foot in the grave could do it , he could , he kept telling himself . He did it , too . Now would n't you think folks would give him credit for that and forget what he said ? But , no , they would n't let him rest . That little old devil , MacNulty , was the worst . His nose and chin came mighty close together , but they 'd spread apart with glee every time they went back for another log . " Some more handspike , Chancey ? " he 'd twit him . As soon as his stint was over , Chancey tried to melt away in the crowd . But wherever he went , folks recognized him and grinned . His father would n't look in his direction , and he dare n't meet his mother 's eye . Libby , when she saw him , told him out in front of everybody that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him , but the worst was the silent pity from Sooth 's brown eyes . He felt relievedthat Kinzie was away in the navy and Huldah in Cincinnati , soon to go to England to stay . The only one of the family Chancey wished for was Guerdon . Good old Guerdon would have stood up for him . He 'd have knocked down the man who called his younger brother a calf . But Guerdon was so long swallowed up by the world that at times he seemed to Chancey like somebodyhe had once read about in a book . From across the field he heard the quavering voices of the old soldiers singing Sinclaire 's Defeat . ' T was November the fourth in a year that is done , We had a sore engagement near to Fort Jefferson . Sinclaire was our commander , which may remembered be , For there we left nine hundred men in Western Territory. p 291All afternoon Chancey had to listen to the pioneer singingand story telling . Their theme was ever of hardship and tragedy , of drowning and starving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old people be so pleased and comforted by such dark and terrible tales ? They engulfedChancey in gloom . He found coming up in him todayall the small creeping terror that used to plague him in church when as a child beside his mother , he listened to the long , shouted sermons on dying and being cast into hell . He could always see hell plain as if he was there , the deep red pits , the brimstone flames and waist deep in them the poor naked people he had known in life , now repentant but too late . Their clothes were burned off but their bodies could never be consumed for that would be unjust to the mercy of God . In hell they must stay not this year and next but forever , crying for mercy , getting not even a drop of water to wet the ends of their tongues . How they could stand it , Chancey did n't know , for he himself would almost expire in rebellion and sympathy . And yet when he looked up at his mother , there she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peace flowed from her , and she could join in a strong quiet voice when they sang : Thee we adore , eternal name , And humbly own to thee , How feeble is our mortal frame , What dying worms are we ! Our wasting lives grow shorter still . Ourselves we can not save . Whate'er we do , whate'er we will , We 're traveling to the grave . How could she ? the little boy would say to himself . And how could all the others , for when he looked around , therep 292the congregation sat undisturbed , singing with a great fervorthat had no resemblance to dying worms at all . Even Massey when she was twelve years old , sewed that awful motto on her sampler and never dropped a stitch . It hung in the hall today . There is an hour when I must die , I do not know how soon . How many children young as I Are called to meet their doom ? It never bothered Massey . Not for a lick . And still did n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all seventeenor eighteen , in their good dresses , and yet playing Father and Son like simple-minded children . You played it in pairs , racing to a mark and back . Each had a switch . On the way over the son tried to birch the father and on the way back it was the father 's turn if he could reach the son . The girls held up their dresses and ran , switching each other unmercifully and pealing with laughter . Only their silly heartlessness , Chancey told himself , could make them cheerful in the face of all the gloom . And yet the sounds of their high spirits drew him hungrily closer , too unsuspectinglyclose , for when Hester Patterson saw him , she put her thumbs to her ears with her hands out like two flaring horns . " M0000 ! " she cried . " M0000 ! " Chancey withdrew with what dignity he could muster while their screaming and howling came after . You 'd think his own sister would stick up for him , but he could hear her laughter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had n't much faith in his mother 's philosophy , but one of her expressions came to him . " You'llp293have to live it down , " she used to say . That 's what he 'd have to do now . Living it down was a harder job than Chancey looked for . Till it was over , he thought the cure worse than the disease . For three weeks he could n't walk across the square without the back of his scalp twitching , fearing the call , " M0000 ! " after him . But when July was out , he breathed deeper . The month of his disgrace had been lived through . Perhaps August would be better . His father seemed a little better , too . Since the night of the celebration he had been ill of the gravel , with pleurisy on the side to plague him . The doctors said he had had too much cheer on Independence Day but Chancey felt a burdeningsense of guilt , although he could n't tell why . Wheneversomeone called at the house to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from over the county , clients , voters , lawyers , court attendants , canal men and friends . Some of them stayed for a meal or the night . But outside , Chancey gave no sign , moving like a sleepwalker through all that went on at the house till Little Turtle came , cutting through his shell to the shrinkingand indefensible self within . It was morning when Chancey walked in the kitchen and found the Indian chief there , journeyed all the way from another state , older now , dressed in white man 's clothes . He had become heavy , his rugged face layered in brown fat . But he carried himself with great dignity , and there was still something in his black eyes that struck fear to those remnants of childhood surviving in Chancey 's breast . " Hanh , Chancey , big boy now , " Little Turtle smacked his lips as he shook hands . " Good urn not dead . Better that way . Come back for um now . Bring squaw . Help take um back to Indian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great abhorrencecame over him . He could barely bring himself to touch the hand of Little Turtle 's squaw . Her hair was greasy , her skin a mass of wrinkles , her expression such that her face seemed a blur , a broad mass of flesh like a buttock , almost devoid of features . She eyed the preparations for dinner greedily , and Chancey 's mother gave her a melon to eat before the meal would be ready , setting the pail of kitchen slop beside her so she could throw away the seeds . The squaw cut the melon with a knife and drank all the insides including the seeds , cut off a large piece of melon , stuck it on the point of the knife , then shook it around in the slop and ate it . Little Turtle laughed broadly to cover his pride . The others smiled but Chancey could n't . Just the way she had done it filled him with uneasy loathing . Chancey 's father sent word he 'd be down for dinner and stay until the doctor came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race beside the coppery face of the Indian , but was glad to see his old friend . Little Turtle'sface glowed like some oaken knot in the fire . Oh , you could see he was pleased seeing his friend , the white judge again , and especially sitting up to his dining table . To him this was a ceremonial room with its white cloth , blue china , great sideboard and mirror hanging there . He carried himselflike a Roman senator . Everything had to be just so . With great dignity he tried to instruct his squaw in the use of fork and spoons but it was no use . " Ca n't do so , " he defended her . " Squaw good . Never cross like white squaw . White man court too long . Maybe get good wife . Maybe get bad . Bad scold all time . All same white man must keep um . Well , how do Indian ? Indian see good squaw . Him go right up . Put two finger like this , p 295hanh ? Make two look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . No danger him be cross . Squaw know what him do if be cross . Throw urn away and get other one . So live happy . Go to heaven . " In the parlor after dinner , Little Turtle showed his squaw what a piano was . " Make music ! " he explained . " Go toot toot . " He turned to Portius . " Him like music . Him father like music . Him fight General Wayne . Say General Wayne make music . Have big dinner horn . General Wayne dinner horn go toot , toot here . Go toot , toot yonder . Gun crack . Indian whoop . Dinner horn go toot toot . Much music . " The Indian woman 's face never changed and Chancey did n't think she looked like she cared a hoot for music , but Little Turtle went on to praise her . " Him Christian , " he said . " All same like you . Go church . All sister , brother . One sister get up talk . Talk all night . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That stop um . Make talk , pray . Sister start sing hymn . Sing loud . Drown urn out . Nobody hear . I -- lave choke sister another time . Then can talk , pray . Sing . You want hear um sing ? " " I think that would be very nice , " Chancey 's mother said from the doorway . Little Turtle turned to his squaw and urged her in Delaware , encouraging her by singing himself as you do to start a child . Chancey did n't recognize a word , but he could make out the air of the doxology . Kain nom moo tooqk owk woz . Kain nom moo waim uh keeng ah yaigh . Kain nom moo wuh Koung kagh tay laick . Kain nom way gweez mint wauk w'jih joqk. p 296The squaw would n't join . She only grunted in Delaware . " Him want hear you make music , " Little Turtle said . " Tell her I 'm extremely sorry I do n't play , " Portius saidcourteously . " Wife play ? " " No , the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him ! Well , glad can do something . You tell um play . " All eyes were on Chancey . He wished now he had sneaked out after dinner . He never enjoyed playing for anyone , let alone for a heathen Indian and his squaw who would n't know a black key from a white one . " I do n't know what to play , " he protested . " Play the Lady of Loti Polka , " Massey suggested . Chancey shook his head . If he did play , never would it be anything gay and fast , or the Indians might want more . No , if he had to play , it would be something they 'd never want to hear again . He 'd make it so dismal and sad they 'd be relieved beyond measure to have it done . He went up to the piano and sat for a little . Then he began the harrowing strains of " On Nebo 's Lonely Mount " or " Moses ' Funeral March . " Before long he was conscious of extraordinary interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of Aunt Unity 's mirrors he glimpsed the Indians manifesting unusualexcitement . Even the old squaw had become alive and was swaying back and forth on her chair while Little Turtle had got up on his feet and was doing a kind of dance . The boy could n't see him continuously , only when he came in range of the glass at which times he perceived wild and terrifying arms flung over him . When he got to the end of the piece , Chancey felt considerablyrelieved . " More , make more ! " Little Turtle shouted. p 297But nothing could have induced Chancey to play again . " I do n't know any more , " he lied . The Indian was disappointed . Almost at once his animationdropped from him and he became his old resolved self . Grim dignity wrapped him like a blanket , and he sat down . But you could see he felt cheated by Chancey . " If ca n't make so , ca n't make so , " he grunted . " Minds me like story . Indian scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on tracks in mud . White men say buffalo track . Scout say maybe no . Maybe Mingue take sticks , make track . Fool white man . Maybe Mingue wait , ambush , scalp . White man be careful . Go slow . Look every bush . White men do so . By and by find dung of buffalo . Indian scout laugh . Now all right , he say . Mingue ca n't make so . Only buffalo can make so . Minds me like Chancey here . Only music man make so . Chancey ca n't make so . " While Chancey 's father was laughing , 1 ) r . Howie came . The boy tried to sneak off , but the doctor caught him . " Wait a minute , Chancey , " he said . " I want you to recovermy other bag from the carriage . " The boy went reluctantly for the bulging bag and its evilly clanking contents . " Now do n't go away , " the doctor instructed him , " I suspect I am going to need you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Saywardand the children had called him faithfully when ailing . Libby thought her father should have him , too , but Portius said he had had Dr. Howie ever since Dr. Pearsall died , that he liked the man and his wit and felt it an injusticeto discriminate against him simply because he was no churchman or son-in-law . Not that he had any prejudicesagainst Harry Conyngham , he went on , who was an estimable and rising young physician . Libby told herp 298mother that her father just wanted his complaints kept secretfrom the rest of the family , but Chancey thought he understood why his father liked the ironical Dr. Howie . They were two of a kind . The doctor stood here now , a tall delicate-appearing man who nearly always looked nearer death than his patients . He moved delicately , too , like one on his way to heaven , but when he opened his mouth , you knew he had no intention of going there , nor was he delicate . He liked to say that he would prescribe pills to the goddess Diana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd practise phlebotomy on would be a brass monkey . It was too messy . However , today at the sight of Chief Little Turtle and his squaw , some perverse humor seemed to possesshim . It appeared to please him to have savage Indians for an audience and the judge 's grand parlor for a lancing room . Not for a moment did he suggest removal to the kitchen . He helped the judge off with his coat , then rolled up the patient 's white shirt sleeves with his own white tapered fingers . Now , pleased with himself and the attention , he handed Chancey a wicked looking gallipot from the bag and held up half a dozen fierce and bloodthirsty lances to select from . Chancey had an uncomfortable feeling at the pit of his stomach . " Hold the vessel here , " the doctor said dryly , " and do n't look so terrified . It 's not you I 'm going to lance , but your father , and I dare n't let him bleed to death or the bench might forfeit my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the needed pitch , holding the gallipot at the required place . He saw the unhealthy white flesh of his father , with black hairs curling like worms , the cruel curve of the rusty lance , then hisp 299father 's warm red life 's blood gushing out like from a steer 's throat at the butcher 's . A violent wave of sickness went over him , and the next thing he knew , he was lying on the sofa with Massey applying cold cloths to his head . Strings of unrecognizable words came from the doctor 's mouth while Chancey 's mother worked with a rag on his bloodstainedpantaloons and Dezia on her knees wiped up the floor where the gallipot still lay . Chancey wanted to scramble up , but his father sternly bade him lie . He had never seen his father so grave and pale . The boy lay there with his eyes closed , every muscle consciousof itself and aquiver . Once he lifted a lid and saw Little Turtle regarding him with contemptuous eyes .

Indian ca n't make um over now . Better be with Great Spirit . " Chancey 's father said nothing . The boy still lay rigid like a prisoner at the scaffold . He heard the doctor go , then his mother help his father upstairs . Soon as his parents ' feet sounded in the upper hall , the boy sprang up and fled . As he snatched his cap from the rack , he could hear Little Turtle 's hoarse laugh after him . The air outside , when he reached it , was sweet as wild honey . It seemed at that moment that if he drank enough of it , all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that , he found , was only his fancy , for as fast as he outraced his dishonor , it caught up to him in painful hu-p 300miliation . He fled the square and headed for the waterfront where fewer would know him . The canal smelled good as he approached it , the scent of stale water and tarry ropes and frying eels , of wood and paint drying in the sun , of mules and down-to-earth manure . The very sight of the district soothed him , the shacks and warehouses , the humblelittle shops , the muddy street and all the boats tied up in the basin . The canal had a kind of bay dug out from it for a boat yard . They called it the Level . It was another world than the square . Boat carpenters sawed , hammered , pounded with calking mallets . The hot foreign scent of tar was stronger here . On the decks of condemned boats , men sat fishing ; a huge darky fried his fish over a fire of oaken chips , using a shovel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gang of naked boys played Whoop , jumping from boat to boat , hiding between , climbing down into empty holds and cabins , and diving out of open windowsinto the yellow water . Chancey sat for a while with his feet down over the side of an abandoned boat , rocking faintly in the small waves stirred up by the boys . Then he lay down on the deck . The rocking , the sound of small lapping against the boat soothed him only for a while . He started to tramp aimlessly again , crossing the lower bridge and back over the next , threading the narrow streets and alleys , his eyes devouring glimpses of strange life through open doors and windows . What he searched for he never knew till he passed an open door on Dock Street . Above it was painted THE RED MULE , and inside he saw Turkey Tench behind the bar . Then he thought he knew . The bitter scent of whiskey and gin flowed like a slow river of air from the door . He had always hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diluted with water for himself and others as children . Hep 301remembered once they had made him drink rum and milk in the Ferry House , and the awful mess he had made over his father on the way home . The clear persistent pattern of it shook him . Then he was only a child . Now he was grown , and yet today he had fainted dead away , defiling himself , his father , the doctor and the carpet . " How are you , Turk ? " " Why , how are you , Mr. Chancey ? " " Will you stake me to a drink ? I 'll pay you next time I come down . " " Why , sure . You have all the credit you want . " Turkey 's look of surprise had not abated and his small black eyes continued to scan Chancey 's face . " What will you have ? " " Brandy . " Chancey heard himself say it like his father . He would drink it if it burned out his throat like a soot fire did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass to hold the first one down . Turkey poured him half a tumblerful , and Chancey stared at the thick glass , trying not to smell it . When he lifted it up , it tasted of fire and musty old cellar barrels . He saw Turkey watching him and the almost imperceptible ebb of the liquor from the glass . After while a girl 's voice sounded in the back room , and Turkey opened the door between . " Rosa ! " he called briefly . " Somebody in here you know . " He left the door open and went back to the bar . When Chancey turned his head again , she was in the doorway , looking extraordinarily slight and sensitive in this uncouth place . So this was where she lived , he told himself , here in this waterfront barroom shack . " Rosa ! Who is it ? " her mother 's sharp voice called from the unseen room . She did n't answer. p 302 " Rosa ! Come back here . I want to talk to you ! " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tavern to stand with Chancey at the end of the bar . " Do n't mind her , " she begged in that gentle way he remembered . But Chancey could n't help minding or feeling for Rosa . She was like he , wronged by the stars , caught in the blind machinations of birth and life . For himself he could do little as yet , but for her he would do a great deal . It made him feel stronger . He could swallow this liquor now . Once he had it down , his mind and tongue began working on all the bitter injustice that had been done him , but before he could bring out half of it , he was stopped by the quick uncommon shadow on her face . When he looked around , he saw through the open door a group of ladies approaching in the street . In their fine gowns , bonnets and manners they looked out of place on the waterfront . They picked their way across Dock Street and formed themselves directly in front of the Red Mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their hands as in church . One of them struck a note . Then their voices rose oddly high , pure and mild in this rough place. 0 , for a heart to praise my God , A heart from sin set free ! A heart that ever feels Thy blood So freely spent for me . " Do n't mind them , " Chancey said . It was his turn now to apologize , for these were intruders from his own part of town . His father frowned on the Temperance Crusaders , but Sooth belonged , joining the group on certain days , helping to besiege some tavern , singing the most reproach-p 303ful hymns they knew to melt men 's hearts . They went summer and winter , knelt in snow or driving rain to pray aloud for the men inside . Chancey had often seen them on Water Street . More than once he had stopped amused to listen . But it was less amusing to be caught inside , especially if your own sister happened to be among the besiegers . When the hymn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leah , started to pray for the salvation of the poor souls and sots within . Inside among those sots themselves , all was interest , respect and a little perplexity . This was something that had to be handled with care like walking on eggs or smoking around black powder . The prayer done , another sacred song was begun . It sounded nearer . " I believe they 're coming in , " Rosa said . Chancey looked around for escape . " You can use the back way , " she told him and showed him how to go . He had a passing glimpse of the same sort of dim room as in the other Tench house along the river and the same Mrs. Tench uncombed and unaged , staring at him like an outraged owl . " Rosa ! Who is that ? " she demanded but Rosa did not reply . " Wait , I 'll go with you , " she whispered at the back door . She threw on a wrap and guided him through several alleys . They came out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking up their talk where they had left off until dusk descended . " I do n't want to go home yet , " she told him . " Will you walk with me to Butterman 's Lock ? " Was it he himself and what he had heard or was it Rosa 's mother and what she said , or why did he have this feeling all evening that he and Rosa were surmounting the worldp 304in being together ? The canal basin tonight seemed like their inland sea with a faint mist already rising and making the rows of moored boats on the other side seem very far away . Silent barges lay nearer . A loaded boat was pulling out , the mules moving like shadows along the tow path , the dark hump of a boy on one of their backs . Rosa and Chancey slowed their pace to keep even with the boat . When it entered the long stretch to Butterman 's Lock , the captain 's horn called to the lock tender over the aisle of dark water . The wild note hung in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the dying strain of the vanished spirit of the wilderness . " Can you float on it , too ? " Rosa asked him . " Especially in the night time like this ? Most every night I lie in bed and close my eyes and go on it wherever I want to . And the longer they draw it out , the farther I can go . " It was n't the boat horn but themselves , that did it , Chanceytold her , their rebellion and liberty that lifted them up . That 's what made life tonight richer and wiser than he remembered it . Seldom had he been so aware of the warm musky scent of the water , the half moon in it and all around him the velvet night , including Rosa . Something appeared to flow from her slight body to his . She seemed like someonehe had known a long time , longer than his mother or Aunt Genny , closer than Sooth or even Massey . No one else knew like she did the words he was about to speak of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could tell in advance what she was about to say , but not always . Frequently her fancy rose like the strange killdeer to circle and cry its wild note over water and cloud . Then often he had to go back to childhood to follow , to know what she meant , to a time when he was very young and could stand in a floating leaf and steer it across a mud-p 305puddle sea . For a moment then his feet felt extraordinarilytiny , like the feet of the little old boatman Rosa told him about , who could dance a jig on a dinner plate and never once get off or break it . It was much later when they came back down Dock Street . They had passed the cabin of the Wizard of the Dell , Rosa said . A little farther on , her young arm stopped him . Ahead in the darkness stood a house of one and a half stories with a squat ugly roof . Save for one lonely window , the house was dark . In that window a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would bisect the window from top to sill and from corner to corner . Afterward she would make occult signs and symbols across her head , across her feet , and then around in circles that grew gradually larger or smaller . " They say she 's a witch , " Rosa whispered . " Something evil is surely going to happen now . " Chancey had never seen anything like it before . He watched with a kind of horrible fascination while the woman performed her secret rites . She seemed to be writingon the night . All she did was of a pattern , had to be done exactly right , and when she finished one series , she would remain utterly still and grim on her feet and rest . Then suddenly , almost vengefully , the lantern would start again . Chancey and Rosa stood a long time watching while the streaks of light were drawn across the darkness in mysteriousdesign and while around them the shadows rose and fell with obscure implications. p 306S AYWARD was beat out about Chancey . She hoped she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know any more what to do with her youngest . Most everything else she had ever got up against , she found she could lick if she stuck to it long enough . But this little old feller from her own womb baffled her . Was n't it singular ? You could wrassle down famine and solitude , the wilderness and the big butts , but the Lord knew just where and how to lay His hand on you to fetch you to your knees . From the year he was born , Chancey had been a cross laid on her . She did n't mind it so much for her own self . She felt thankful enough for all the good luck her other young ones had . If this littlest one had to be puny , she 'd nurse and feed him best she could . She 'd give him from herp 307own self what he needed . She 'd make a man out of him yet . But all the time , she knew now , the cards were stacked against her , and against every other mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything she wants for her young ones while they 're little . But she better recollect they grow up mighty soon . And then they do as they please . Next DecemberChancey would be eighteen years old and had his own mind this long time . It was a good mind , too , from his father 's side . His stubbornness likely came from both sides . But where , she pondered , did all his strange notions and ways come from ? Ever since he was little , he had made up stories and claimed they were true  --  like riding on a cow that time and that she and Portius were n't his real mother and father . No , according to Chancey , they were just some hirelings , his real folks had left him with till they 'd come for him . Genny said that was the most ungrateful thing from a young one she ever heard , but Sayward reckoned it was n't bad as all that . Some young ones just took curious notions like they did ailments such as St. Vitus dance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did grow out of his . She thought it was the St. Vitus dance that made him go around by himself . This was a good while ago . He did n't want other folks looking at him when he jerked and twitched , and she did n't blame him . But when that was over , he shied from folks just the same , and then for a while he made an awful fuss about going to church , claiming that people in church whispered about him . " You 're fourteen years old and too big for such bosh ! " she told him vigorously . " Folks have more important things to talk about than you . " It did n't do much good , and in the end she blamed herself that she had n't raised him right . If she 'd worked himp 308harder , he 'd have been stout enough to keep up his end of the log that time at the raising . If she 'd kept on doing her own butchering like she used to and made him help , he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names Off-ox and Butcher Boy , called after him . Where she made the mistake was letting a little sickness coddle him . Had she brought him up rough and tumble like his brothers and sisters , he 'd known how to call back worse names than he got , and then the others would be glad to leave him alone . Of course it would have been still better to knock down and drag out a few . Then he 'd had some real peace . But never would Chancey stand a hitch with anybody . He would n't turn on his tormentors , the only ones he ever answered were some harmless old men that teased him down by the bridge , and then he said the wrong thing . It went all over town . " You can make fun of me now ! " Chancey called back . " But remember my name . If you live long enough , I 'll make you ashamed that you ever made fun of Chancey Wheeler ! " That was a summer or two ago . This spring he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and garden . When she held him to it , he cried out it was a disgrace . She was thunderstruck though she tried not to show it . " Why is honest work a disgrace ? " she wanted to know . " It 's all right for those who have to , " he told her . " But you 're the richest woman in Americus and I 'm your son and yet we have to go out and work like hired men in the field . " It came to her mind to say , I thought you said you were n't my son , Chancey , but never would she cast that up to him . " Work 's the best thing we can do , Chancey , " she said . " Robert Owen did n't think so and he was one of the greatest thinkers of our age . He said if you make a manp 309happy , you make him virtuous . That 's his whole system  --  making people happy . " " We want to make you happy , too , Chancey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say . But what you mean is you want me to work and be happy . You 're so used to working all your life , Mama , you ca n't live without working . You would n't know what to do with yourself . Thank God I 've never been spoiled like that . " " Spoiled ? " Sayward swallowed . " Yes , you wo n't even have a hired girl in this big house . You insist on doing all the work yourself . Do n't you understand , Mama , there are more important things than work in this world ? " " What for instance ? " " Well , Robert Owen said that one of the main occupationsof working people should be play . He practised it , too . He arranged in his factories that the laborers could dance , relax , talk and sing and amuse themselves all they wanted . He was the real pioneer , Mama , not you and the settlers . Now phalanxes are taking up his revolutionary ideas . Every member of a phalanx is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can choose his own work and do as little of it as he wants to . That 's in the constitu-tion . " " If everybody can pick the easy work , who 'll do the hard and ugly work ? " Sayward asked meekly . " Of course there 'll have to be a little repulsive labor at first , " Chancey admitted . " But progress will do away with all toil and labor in time . Meanwhile those who do that work will get a little more credit against their rent and meals . They 'll also get a share of the profits . Everybody else will share alike . There 'll be no rich people and no poorp 310people , just brothers and sisters . And everybody will have security and happiness . " " Everybody but your mother , " Portius put in . " I ca n't conceive of her being happy there . " " Not if I had to work to make up for all those lazy shirkerswho wanted to dance and play and have a good time all the time ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the desert with savages and rattlesnakes for my brothers and sisters and live my own life and get paid for my own labor . Such schemes never worked in this world and never will , but the 're always cracked people getting born who try to get something for nothing . " " See , I told you ! " Chancey said to his father . " Now just a minute , Sayward , " Portius rumbled in his easy powerful way that made you feel small for getting hot under the collar . " I do n't support everything the boy stands for , but he has a point . It was essential for you and me to toil and sweat when first we came to the wilderness . We had to cut down the tremendous forest and break in the new land in order to live . If the young folks had to do that today , I believe they could  --  " " And a good thing it would be for them , too , " she interjected . " But the point is they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to any more either . We are well off and so are our children . Things have changed . " " I do n't see our grandchildren coming in the world with didies on now that things have changed and folks are so well off like you say , " she retorted . " There always was work and there always will be . Some folks just never want to do any . Even those who had to slave and sweat the most to get their heads above water now say they do n't want their young ones to have to go through what they had to. p 311They 'd never reckon to train a young horse by letting him stand in the stable or pasture . They know mighty well the minute they 'd put him in a plow or on the road , he 'd sweat his self to pieces . He 'd be too soft . But that 's the way they coddle their own flesh and blood . Well , what they do n't learn their young ones about work and hardship , life will learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outmoded thing to say , " Portius declared . " People are more enlightened now in the nineteenth century . " " Robert Owen says , Papa , " Chancey put in , " relieve the people of want , and you relieve them of evil and unhappi-ness . " " Bosh and nonsense , Chancey ! " his mother flared . " Makinga body happy by taking away what made him unhappy will never keep him happy long . The more you give him , the more he 'll want and the weaker he 'll get for not having to scratch for his self . The happiest folks I ever knew were those who raised their own potatoes , corn and garden stuff the first spring out here . They 'd been half starved but they found out they could get the best of their own troubles . They would n't have traded that first sack of meal from their own corn for half of Kentuck . That kind made good neighbors , too , and mighty handy to have around in time of trouble . If making your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of date , then the good Lord is out of date because that 's the way He lets us sink or swim with our troubles . " " I 'm not acquainted with the ways of the Almighty , " Portius said with irony . " But the Indians practised the philosophyyou mention , and you know how far they got with it . " That 's the way it went , on and on . She would fire onep 312barrel , and Chancey or Portius the next . In the end she saw it was no use . Talking never got you anywhere . You ca n't make somebody believe what he does n't want to . Besides , she did n't like falling out with her own boy . If he could n't make the best of her as she was , she could of him as he was . " You said folks had to do a little work at first , Chancey , " she said humbly . " If you do n't want to work out in the lot , what do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told her . She had to admit she was bamfoozled . " What do you aim to do up there ? " " Write letters to the newspapers . Exchange views with leaders like Robert Owen . " Sayward turned away . So that was his idea of work ! It was bad enough for her own son to take stock in all these crack-brained schemes for lazy folks to shirk work and have a good time doing what they wanted to do . Now he was going to shut himself up like a hermit , the way his pappy did years ago before she broke him of it . A month passed and all this time Chancey had n't worked in the lot . Sayward did his share herself . Whenever she went by in the upstairs hall , she saw him sitting at his little table by the window . He had made it his writing desk . Most times when she made his bed or changed it or while she cleaned up his room trying to make no more dust with her rag and broom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the window . Only once in a while did she hear his quill scratch . What he was setting down on the white paper , she had no idea , save that it must be something serious the way his lower lip pushed out and his blue eyes were on fire . " Is this what you like to do , Chancey ? " she asked one day timidly , and he nodded like his thought was far away on something grand and more important. p 313What would come out of such strange makeshift for work , Sayward did n't know . But one day Genny came and asked had she read last week 's Centinel . It had a poem in it she said that Sayward ought to know about , if she did n't , for some said the person , Ripheus , who signed it , was no other than Chancey , and he and Portius might have reasons of their own not to show it to her . When Genny was gone , Sayward hunted till she found the paper and spelled that poem through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , from his school work she knew he could write . Many a rhyme of his had Massey or Dezia read to her . He stammered sometimes when he talked , but not on paper . Portius said he would some day put his father to shame with the pen . But never had that devilish quality of his father so come out in Chancey like it did in this poem . She felt queer all over when she read it , for this sounded like some of her own talk against progress turned back against her . THE FROGS ' PETITIONTo those who rule Americus Our meek petition we address : Return unto the status quo Of forty , fifty years ago ! Reverend sirs , today be knownOur race has grievance with your own . Hard have we suffered by your rude Assaults upon our solitude .

Not satisfied with this , you 've schemed A human course we never dreamed. p 314You drained the water from our land And left us perish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is progress , to be up-to-date . Now beg we that this thing you do , Our great just cause take into view . Return unto the status quoOf forty , fifty years ago . Remember that our nightly songYour children 's sleep would much prolong . From early in the evening hours . You all have heard when copious showers From Heaven descend upon our dwelling , It makes our throats with joy be swelling . Do then , kind sirs , take pity on us . Let water once more be upon us . Shut up this ditch , then we will pay Our best respects and humbly pray That you who are so very clever May live in peace with us forever , Close by our sweetly stagnant stream , The insect 's hum , the panther 's scream , Back in the golden status quo Of forty , fifty years ago . Ripheus . The strange feeling the poem gave her discomfited Saywardlong after she laid it down . Everybody who read it must know she was the one it meant . The city had wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got up a petition against it . When she wanted her land drained , she said , she would drain it herself . And now Chan-p 315cey had gone and poked fun at his own mother , siding her with the frogs . But she had to give in that it was a master poem and clever . Portius could not have rhymed it better . She had n't reckoned Chancey could be so sly . Oh , if it was he who did it , she felt proud of him . She 'd tell Portius and the others they need n't have held it back from her . The only part that made her feel bad was that somebody else had to tell her about it . With careful shears she cut out the poem and laid it in her Bible . It was , she told herself , the first rhyme any Luckett ever had printed in the paper . But she had a curious notion it was not the last . Only yesterday the girls told her they heard that Chancey was trying to get a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They said working in General Morrison 's bank would suit him better because it did n't open till ten o'clock in the morning and closed shortly after noon . But Sayward rather hoped it was true . Barnaby Lane from Rhode Island had started the Centinel . He had printed it first in Tallow Alley on a hand-press he fetched up the river . Sometimes in the early days when stock was scarce , it would come around on pink or yellow paper . The girls and even Resolve used to call it the Palladium of Human Liberty because that was the motto printed under the name . " Well , I see the Palladium of Human Liberty 's come , " Libby would say , fetching it in . But Sayward stood up for it then and now . She said Barnaby Lane had gone into businesswithout running out and borrowing ' money like the bank did , only the bank called it capital . What 's more , Lane put in an honest day 's work . She had passed his place one time at night and saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now who ever saw one of these bankers in their offices after dark , she asked . This afternoon an envelope from the Centinel came top 316the house for Chancey . A boy fetched it . She laid it at Chancey 's place for supper , hoping he would say something . When he sat down at the table , he opened and read it , but not a word to anybody what was in it . That evening when she had to run up on the third floor , his room was empty . " He 's gone , " Massey told her . " I saw him right after suppergoing toward the canal . " It had been one of those days , Chancey told himself , when hardly could he stand it any longer at home . Even in his room on the third floor he could feel the strong vibrationsof his family below him , the robust exertions and pleasures of their lives . It was in the banging of pots and pans , the certain sound of doors and dishes , in the vigorous pitch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family were always dropping in . They were so sufficient to themselves , he thought . That was it . Nothing stopped them . Any one of his people could go it alone , ask for no quarter , do without your help . There was Huldah across the sea in England now . All the wild things she had done that she should n't , and yet she thought it fitting that she should be mistress of a castle and have people call her Lady Huldah since George Seton 's father , the lord , had died . Hardly could Kinzie wait till his ship docked in England so he could put on his finest uniform and visit her . The Wheelers were like that , ready for anything , afraid of nothing . His mother called it snap ; his father , the dash of the pioneers . If only there had been another in the family puny , lazy and cowardly like he ! Just the thought of having such a brother or sister , perhaps one even worse than he was , lifted him up , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 317mit he was puny or cowardly or anything else that was n't good . He was strong as anybody else , she claimed . He could see through her stand . She would hound him till he was hearty as his Uncle Wyitt , ambitious like Resolve , smart as his father and musical as Sooth . But nobody could make that much out of him , Chancey told himself , for none understood him save Rosa . Tonight at supper when he read the penciled note from Mr. Lane , it came to him what he would do . Now as he left the house , he felt at once like a different person . When he came down Sixth Street and saw the Basin ahead shining in the late afternoon light , his body turned ten pounds lighter . The soft heavy smell of the canal relaxed him . The broad letters of a boat 's name , like M A R Y ELLEN or BETSY AN N , painted around the stern , gave him feelings he never had at home , as when sometimes through the murky water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was gone . Scarcely anybody down here knew him or expected anything of him . He could do as he pleased . He was just Chancey , and if he was a Wheeler , that was as good a name as the next . They did n't hold it against him that he was of the gentry , so long as he put on no airs . The Wizard of the Dell told Rosa he liked him because he was common as anybody . But let him turn back toward home right now , and he would feel his family take hold of him like he was a horse suddenly hitched to a mill 's machinery . At once he would be fast again , pulling the heavy interlocking wheels and cogs of the Wheelers , the brick mansion house on the square , the court house where his father reigned like the priest in his robe and Resolve like a prince of the realm . Just to think of his brother standing up so cool and composedin front of a crowded courtroom made him feel allp 318funny , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , and he was n't cool and collected at all . Had he told them tonight at the table about the note from Mr. Lane , he knew in advance how it would go . " A position on the Centinel ! " Dezia , who was home for supper , would say . " How much does it pay ? " His father would nod sagely . " Lane is not too brilliant . But he has sound views . Are you going to take it ? " And that cruel look of strong secret feelinghe knew so well would come out on his mother 's face . Never would Rosa unsettle and debase him so . He waited to tell her tonight till they walked up to Butterman 's Lock . It had started to get dark when he gave her the letter , but it was still light enough to read the large penciled handwriting . Seldom had she given him such a blinding look as when she handed it back to him , and not a word should he take the position or how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night that something wonderfulwas going to happen to you , " she told him . " We were on some high place with castles all around . They brought you a royal diary out of a stone tower . It said that once you had come secretly to see the queen . They pointed up at a circle of stars in the sky and called it the Crown or Corona . Two or three bright shining stars were moving in the circle . The people called out it was a good sign . You were pleased . I remember you wore a cream-colored robe with strips of soft brown fur around your neck and shoulders . You looked like a king or a high judge of the land . " He kept perfectly quiet , waiting for her to go on . She always said things that made him feel so wonderful , gave him such confidence in himself . Never were they the same thing , always new , ever a surprise . He thought she would say more now , but she did n't . He wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to tell him. p 319 " Next Saturday 's the end of the month , and when I get paid , I 'm going to buy you a present , " he told her . " That would be wonderful , Chancey ! " " Either a brown or a green parasol , I have n't made up my mind yet which . " Her eyes were brilliant . " Brown , if you can , Chancey . A golden colory brown ! " Now he was almost sure that there had been nothing bad in the dream . Her eyes were clear as amber . All the mysteriousdark flecks and shadows had vanished . He felt their world rising around them , his and Rosa 's private world , but mostly was it Rosa 's , textured by her dress and face and voice and by the things she said . All evening he would live and move in it , and so hard was that world to die that even after he left her for the night , its half-painful sweetness would follow him home . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one most to be desired , never to be given up , always to be held to . His first world , of the Square and his family , was the heaviest . The second world , the one he used to retreat to in order to get away from the first , was the lightest , of fragile weight and fabric so that when he returned from its dreams and shadows he could scarcely remember what it was really like , although he knew and understood perfectly while he was there . These two worlds lay far apart and never would they meet . But his and Rosa 's world moved at will into one or the other , could be at the same time apart from and parcel of either , and all the while be both real and insubstantial , remembered and forgotten . The talk of the first world was hard and clear , that of the second world in few words at all . But the talk of his and Rosa 's world was sometimesspoken , sometimes thought , and ever held meanings more subtle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Centinel which were meant to go far beyond the inky newspaper office , to be carried over city and countryside , to be read , remembered and forgotten days from now in houses and under trees and on decks of boats followingthe canal as far as Cincinnati . Chancey dropped no hint to his mother about the Centinelwhen he got home . Not often had he risen so early as he did on Monday morning , nor had bed ever tasted so sweet . If he was surprised to see his mother already down in the kitchen , he did n't show it , and neither did she to see him , although he had to admit hers might be the bigger surprise . Presently he found himself among other silent men tramping the misty streets of Americus toward work . He had thought to sit most of the day at an office table writing as he did at home . But there was no low table in the Centinel office . Desks stood four feet high . In the shop he found type cases as high or higher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run errands , collect mercantileannouncements , deliver proofs and printing jobs , help turn presses . When he had n't anything more to do , he could stand at a desk and write copy for the paper . Hardly could he crawl home those first nights . So this was what men went through who toiled for a living , he told himself . As long as he lived , he felt that the six a.m. bells would give him a sick feeling at his stomach . A fierce gratitude came up in him for Robert Owen and all those revolutionary thinkers who would lighten labor , the curse of the world since Adam , and root out its evil . They knew what it did to human souls . He did n't believe he 'd have lasted through the week save for the image of Rosa in his mind , a bright Rosa in the gloom , a fresh Rosa when he was sweated and wearied , and in the heat , a cool Rosa like one of those statues they prayedp 321to in the Irish church . Thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the week and spend his wages . He noticed with mixed feelings that the apprenticesreceived no pay . The printers were handed envelopes heavy with money , but to Chancey , Mr. Lane gave no more than a slip of paper . " What 's this for ? " the boy stammered . " That 's an order for your wages . Cash is scarce , but if you take it to Harley Fry , I think he 'll pay you the two dollars he owes me . He 's owed it for eighteen months . " Chancey took the order and left for uptown at once . If he hurried he could collect his wages and still get home in time for supper that his mother never failed to keep warm for him . Harley Fry was a cabinet maker . ' Hie long double front room stood crowded with bedsteads and footboards , bureaus , wash stands and coffins . The house smelled of paint , varnish and supper . " I can pay you , " the old man said . " But not in ready money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have on hand . But I 'll give you an order on Albert Logan . He owes me a good deal more than that . Maybe you can get two dollars out of him . I ca n't . " Chancey felt the life go from him like air from a blown bladder . He left Harley Fry 's slowly , ashamed to go home so late now without his wages . It took a long time and desperationto get up courage to knock on the Logan door . He knew before it opened that he would not get his money . Had he been Resolve or his father standing there with power and presence , it might have been different , he felt . But these men would only shoo a boy from one to another . He found Albert Logan a big man and stone mason . Like a hammer knocking off pieces of rock with each word , he gave his opinion of Harley Fry and other well-to-do menp 322who pushed him for money and still worse , those who owed him and would n't pay . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancey sat down and wrote him out an order on Minor Jones , the jobber , he 'd sign it . Chancey never did get his supper that night . Minor Jones was n't at home when he got there and the boy had to wait a long time . When he did come , he said he had been down town for Saturday night and had spent what cash he had in his pocket . The banks were closed . It was late . He would have to give him an order on Tom Brill , the grocer . If Chancey hurried , he could still get his money from him . The boy left as soon as he was able , but it was ten o'clock and Brill was putting the heavy wooden shutters on his store windows when the boy got there . The grocer stood reading the order , his dour lips moving . " It 's too late to send me to anybody else tonight ! " Chanceybegged to forestall him . " Well , " the storekeeper said shrewdly , " sign it Received in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to take it out in trade . Now be smart about it . I 'm closing . " Chancey wanted to cry out that the grocer surely must have the money in his till . It was Saturday night and he had done business all day . But the words would n't come . Desperatelyhe looked around the store . If only it had been a general store , there would have been umbrellas among the blankets , piece goods , queensware and such . But here were only things to eat , not a parasol or bolt of goods in the house . In the end , goaded by the grocer , he let himself be loaded down with flour , loaf sugar , stick candy and milk lunch crackers . He had to pay a penny for each paper sack . Then hoping that Rosa would take the things for her mother and understand , he stumbled out into the darkness for the waterfront. p 323W HAT had come over her , Rosa whispered to herself , that she did n't like winter any more ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , so was summer when it came , and so were fall and spring . But only winter had coasters and skaters , the black and white she passionatelyloved and the crispness of being that her secret self fed on . Only in winter could she ride the north wind , survivethe frost and prove that she was immortal . Then how was it that already in December she hungeredfor spring , for green and warmth , for the sun ? Every evening , the six o'clock darkness and long winter night came bitter and cruel . They had never seemed so before . Was it some deep disorder or foreboding  --  what her mother called " a messenger " ? Or could it be Chancey , that he did n't come around to her mother 's little house behind the Red Mule any more ? In January , at a safe distance , Rosa stood in the snowy square one evening and looked across at the great Wheelerp 324house . How high it looked and wide ! You might think it need n't be very deep to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and more of the house came into view , it astonished her again how far back the side walls and windows reached . It was a brick world in itself . Chancey'sfolks must have more space than they knew what to do with . If some of the family were in one room , the rest could go to another . And if company came to that room , they could move on to another and still another room , all downstairs , not counting the hall nor the rooms upstairs . What was it about the Wheeler house gave her this strange feeling , she wondered , half burning hot , half icy cold . It came to her on the street , when she sighted one of the Wheelers or heard the name spoken . Was it her bond with Chancey ? Or could it be what some folks whispered to her , that she was n't a Tench and ought to be with the Wheelers ? Hardly could that be true , she thought , for , save Chancey , none of them would look at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mother , with her face brown as an Indian 's , her hair combed tight as could be , and she not a Wheeler anyway save by name . Well , except for Chancey , neither did she , Rosa , give a hait about any of the Wheelers , but she could n't say that about her own family . If she was n't a Tench , why did she look forward all day just to see them again in the evening , although she had left them only that morning ? And when one of her brothers lay sick in his bed or was in trouble for doing what he should n't , why did pity flood her like a hemorrhage , proving he was truly of her own flesh and blood ? She even felt loving toward Turkey 's wife , Lulu , who came to live with them and she could hardly wait for the day when Lulu 's baby came to make her Aunt Rosa and bring more life to their little house , for how could itp 325crowd them as some folks said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But where was Chancey ? Before Christmas , the canal had frozen up , the boatmen had gone home , if they had any , and there was skating all along the waterfront , especially in the basin . Then for a day or two the weight lifted on Rosa , for she felt sure Chancey would come . She came home early on purpose Saturday afternoon . The lively scene lay in front of her , the bright reds and greens of the skaters , the children on sleds , the long chains of boys and girls , the graceful ladies with skirts almost sweeping the canal , the stout men and old men light on their feet as dancing masters . But nowhere among them could her eye make out Chancey though she watched till the misty hills looked furry in the sunset light that was blue with the woodsmoke from a thousand chimneys . The first time it snowed , the men and boys swept it off with a will . It snowed again heavily the third day and this time they shoveled only a wide path to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third time it snowed , only the children came to clear a ring or two , and that for a long while was the end of the skating . So far , since winter had set in , there had n't been a day of thaw . The first snow still lay on the ground under all the rest . Was it to be this way all winter , she asked herself , no break in this long bitter stretch until spring ? The first snow had been pleasant enough when it fell , casting such a friendly feeling upon everybody out on errands or shovelingpaths . It made even the grumpy cheerful , and uptown among the big houses all seemed so cordial and gay . On the night of the second fall , Rosa stood a while out in the back yard , drinking it in ; the pale light , the utter stillness and the snow lying thick over houses and out buildings , bushesp 326and fences . This is what she used to do as a little girl when they lived along the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic of the new world she found herself in . It was like nothing else she knew . The soft fragrantsmell of the snow was in her nostrils . Sometimes she could feel a fine rain of flakes from the roofs in her face . The snow on the roof edges rose like bread , and she thought of the rabbit sitting in his warm nest . Winter is the best time of the year , she told herself , if you are snug and happy . She could hear the fine bells of cutters uptown and the bobsleds ' deep bells down Dock Street . Oh , winter was far and away the finest season , she thought , but why when everything lay so white and pure in the world , should such dark shadows lay on her mind ? The cold set in after Christmas like a strong man settlinghimself in bed . Night after night Rosa could hear the house crack like a fowling piece with the frost . A big thermometerhung nailed with a hundred other signs to Meeks ' store front . Mornings on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercury was swallowed up , vanished . The red crept out a little until she came home in the evening . Sometimes it rose high enough to foretell snow again , but by another morning or two the glassy upright line would stand pale and bleak once more . Roof icicles stabbed toward the ground , and over the shoveled piles of snow you could see little more than the driver and the nodding heads of his horses . But where was Chancey ? Had his heart 's blood frozen in his veins like the red stuff in Meeks ' thermometer ? She kept remembering all the good times they had had last summer , especially the night at Dixes ' wake . Chancey had n't wanted to go at first , and once there , he looked like he would bolt , for the Dixes had no cool room to put the corpse in but had p 327to keep her in the kitchen-sleeping room with the company . All the time somebody had to stand there sopping baking soda water on one cloth over the corpse 's face and on anothercloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rise too strong . Rosa thought nothing of doing her turn , but Chancey stood from her as far as he could , looking like the whitewashon the wall . Then after the barroom closed , Turkey came . " I been working all night and I 'm hungry ! " he bawled and went to the cupboard . " What ! Did n't she bake anything before she died ? Well , she 'll pay for it , I 'm a tellin ' you . " He went across the room and tickled the bare feet of the corpse 's older sisters lying on the bed . They thought it was flies and kept twitching and shooing . The whole company had to choke to keep back from laughing , and that was only the start . When Rosa and Chancey got outside , they had to hold each other . She was n't over it by the time she got home . Her mother asked her what could be funny at a wake , and she had n't dared tell on account of Turkey . Oh , Chancey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Chancey now ? Her mother claimed she knew . She would n't say right out who told her , but let it be known she had talked it over with Miss Bogardus . According to her , Chancey never gave a bait for Rosa , and it was good he did n't , her mother hinted darkly , because he could n't give her the rights and rewards of a decent girl . All the time he came down here to see her , he had somebody else picked out for himself , a young lady who would fit in with the Wheelers and Morrisons and their fine houses on the square . No , there was nothing honest in Chancey Wheel-p 328er 's coming to see her , and if she knew what was good for her and him , too , she 'd thank him for staying away from her and clear him out of her mind . All the times her mother said this , and when she did n't , she sat there wrapped up in herself by the stove , living her life in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she first remembered her , although these last years she let Rosa comb some of the wild tangles out of her hair . Rosa 's father 's coal black mane had streaked long ago , and now it looked like iron strings dipped in lime . But her mother 's brown head had n't a gray thread woven in it . The only way you could tell she was older was by her glasses . All these years she had sat in her dark kitchen reading like an owl in a hollow tree . At last she claimed she could hardly tell any more who came in at the door . Rosa fetched pair after pair of glasses home to try until she found one to suit . They suited her in more ways than one , Rosa thought , for now no matter what was said , her mother could sit behind those spectacles in her own world and all you could make out from her eyes were the hard lights glinting on her glasses . When her mother spoke of Chancey and his fine young lady , Rosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She went on just as if her mother had n't spoken . She would give it no room in her mind , no shred of existence . Then it could n't hurt her , for so far as she was concerned , it was n't true and could n't be , like the story of the child that never knew about Death and never would believe it , and even on her death bed , Death could n't harm her , for it had no power over her . But if Rosa would n't mention it , a mysterious voice in her mind would . Many times it plainly said , " Who is this fine young lady ? " She would be sitting sewing a ribbon or combing her hair and suddenly in the 329silence this voice would ask , " What is she like that Chanceylikes her better than you ? " Never did the voice sound like her own or any voice she knew . Now whose voice could it be , she pondered , saying , " you " and not " me " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking in , it was her mother 's . " I hear he took this young lady to Tateville Saturday night , " she would say . " You can be glad you did n't go . " That would throw Rosa 's thought to the sleighing parties . They had started in January . First seven sleds had come to Americus from Tateville crowded with young folks shouting and singing . They carried a white flag with a green face and a thumb held to its nose . The young ladies of Tateville , it was said , had sewed it up , but what young ladies , Rosa 's mother asked , would sew up a thing like that ? She said it must be a made-up story , but Dennis said he saw the flag with his own eyes at the Washington House where the Tateville people ate their supper . A good many others saw it , too , and said they could n't let Tateville get away with that . The next Saturday night sixteen four-horse sled loads went to Tateville from Americus crying out they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lost it the next Saturday night when Tateville came back with twentythreesleds . From then on every time Americus went to Tateville or Tateville came to Americus , it took more sleds and folks to get the flag . Now this was the last of February and everybody said that any day the snow would go . And yet it held on . Tatevillehad come to Americus last week with nearly eighty sleds , and all Americus prayed the snow would last another Saturday night . The biggest sleighing crowd in the history of Ohio would journey to Tateville then . The whole coun-p 330try around Americus , on both sides of the river , was scoured for the promise of teams and sleds . Nearly a dozen sleds were going from the waterfront alone , and Rosa told Idilla and Vic that she would ride along . And then she wished she had n't . It was all right , she saw clearly , just to lay eyes on Chancey again , but not if this other person was with him . Once her eyes glimpsed them together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps their sleds would stop side by side , or they would all have supper at the same table . The sight of him and her together would be like a knife . She wished now she had n't said she would go , but it was too late . She could n't bear to go and see him , and yet now that she had gone this far , she could n't bear to stay away . There were ninety-six sleds that went to Tateville from Americus that night , counting the two-seaters and cutters . Not that many lined up on Sixth Street in Americus to start , but at every side road halfway to Tateville sleds with shouting and singing young people waited to join the procession . From the top of the Long Swamp hill Rosa could see against the snow an endless dark train of teams ahead and a longer one winding behind them . And instead of thawing , it was still snowing . Now and then flurries would come licking their faces with melting flakes , bringingthe mighty chorus of a thousand voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear the concord of another thousand voices behind her . It was a curious and wonderful thing to hear , the great song waxing and waningand turning upon itself with distance and the wind . The same words and bar would come a second and third time with such power that blood was fetched to her head . After the snowy swirls , the early moon came out , racing through the clouds , making the countryside bright as day . Oh , p 331never , Rosa thought , had she seen and felt such deadly loveliness before . Half of Tateville lined the streets to welcome them when they got there . Only the first section of sleds could get near the square . Rosa and her friends had to get down a long way out . Where his sled would be later on , the driver did not know . Nobody cared . It was good to use your legs after so long a ride . Tonight Tateville belonged to Americus , with Americus folks tramping the sidewalks and streets , calling and laughing in a monster open-air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Rosa 's laugh did n't carry very far . She was unwilling here to look at folks directly . She moved along taking care to sec over heads and past faces . It would be too hard a blow for her eyes to come on them suddenly together . She had no fear to miss him . If Chancey were somewhere in the crowd , his face would make itself known to her , or his proud head or stiff spindly shoulders . The smallest part of him would jump to her eye from the crowd like the name , Wheeler , always jumped from a crowded column in the Centinel . What she would do then , she did n't know . She and Idilla and Vic were standing outside the Rising Sun when she felt a hand on her arm . She knew without turning whose hand it was . She could tell by the violent feeling that went over her . She had been waiting with the others to get their supper . For a long time they had stood in the crowded line , moving by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Another minute or two they might have been in the warm . But now Rosa 's arm was n't hers any more but belonged to the hand that had touched it , and where it drew her , she went also . Shame rose before she went very far . Was she so weak that all this winter he could stay away from her at homep 332without a word sent or written , and then when he chanced to see her in a strange city , he need only touch her arm and she would follow like a blind woman the hand that guided her ! She would go with him only a little way , she told herself , just far enough to be out of hearing of Americusfolks . Idilla and Vic could think she deserted them . Right now they had likely turned to watch the white scarf on her head ride through the crowd like a duck on the river . But if they waited a little , they would hardly know she had gone , for in a minute or two she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went , and it would be the same on her return . " Now I 'm going back ! " she would tell Chancey suddenly in a way so he knew that nothing would stop her . At the first stretch of empty sidewalk she would say it , or in the middle of this long dark block . Surely at the next lamp post she would do it , where she could see his face when she told him . But he was the one who turned first . " You should n't have come , " he blamed her . " I promised I would n't see you again . " " Promised ! " she blazed at him . " Why should you promiseif you do n't want to ? " " My father made me . " Rosa let that turn around slowly in her mind . " How did he make you ? " " He said it was n't right for us to go together . " " Why ? " she asked though she thought she knew . " Because it 's evil  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't sure that she knew at all . That strange , half-hot , half-icy cold feeling of the Wheelers went over her , mysteriously strangling her and at the same time freezingthe soft inner marrow of her bones. p 333 " Who am I ? " she asked him so low that scarcely could she hear herself . " You can ask your mother , " was all he said . " Why must I ask her ? She would n't tell me anything . " " She told my father . That 's why he talked to me . She wrote him a letter . She said it was wicked and immoral , our being together and he had to keep us from ever seeing each other again . " " My mother ! " Rosa whispered . Hardly could she believe it . Her mother , sitting in her chair in the brown dress Rosa herself had made for her , with the book Rosa fetched for her in her lap , with the glasses Rosa bought for her on her nose , and all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll come back when we wo n't have to wait for supper , " he promised , but Rosa scarcely heard him . " Is it true that it 's evil for us to go together ? " she whispered . " It 's against the law  --  and the church . " " Then we ca n't ever see each other again ? " At his answer Rosa 's foot slipped in the snow and she would have stumbled had he not held her . The strangeness of the street at night was a dark cloud around her and he was the wind carrying her here and yonder . Her body might have been a snowflake blown this way and that , yet always coming back in the end to the shape of her body . Already the square was far away , Idilla and Vic small and distant in her mind . Could it he just a few minutes ago that she had stood there talking to them at the Rising Sun ? So much had happened since Chancey had touched her . Where they were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alike to her . Only the last one they came to she thought she knew . She had heard of Tateville 's Frontp 334Street , and here was the river . In summer it must be grand with the great houses getting the breeze , but now all was locked in a wintry and snowy death . A few blocks more and the street changed . One-sided above , it was two-sided below , with dark and deserted workshops crowding each other . She and Chancey could be alone here . They could find solitude among the silent warehouses and mills , the factories and brew houses . They could say anything they wanted and none except themselveswould hear . Yet hardly a word passed between them . Always afterward would she mingle this night , she thought , with the warm soft smell of dyes , the cold hard scent of iron and the sweetness of malt and hops , with the mysteriousstillness of the darkened buildings and visible between them on one side the bleak white expanse of river . It was late when they got back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way than that she have her supper with him in the elegant Mansion House . The dining room , almost bare of both food and diners now , received them . When they came out , the square lay almost empty of teams and sleds . From far through the city and the country beyond , they could hear the stream of song and sleighbells drifting back to them . " They 're gone ! " Rosa said , meaning Idilla and Vic . " Not everybody , " Chancey said . " I 'll get you home . " He took her hand and dragged her over to a long low bobsled with four black horses . " We missed our party , George , " he called to the driver . " Can we go back with you ? " Like a Wheeler , he did n't wait for a yes or no , but lifted her over the low board to an open space among the dark forms . Rosa slipped quickly down in the thick straw under the covers . Already it felt warm down there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though she couldn'tp 335see their faces , they could have seen hers coming out of the Mansion House . She was aware now that there were no coarse quilts here as in the sled she had come in , only soft blankets . The scent of fine fabric and leather told her this was no common sled . She wished now she had held back . Sooner would she have walked all the way home with Chancey , if need be , than this . Once out in the country , the couples turned to themselves , became blind and deaf to the others around them . Rosa crept farther down under the blankets . The sled mounted the hills , slid through the high white banks , sped over snowy fields . They passed farm houses and barns standing extraordinarily still in the winter night . The road went so close , they could smell mows and horses and the soft milky scent of cows . Once through a wintry woods , Rosa fancied she smelled spring . Most of the time she lay back , making all she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , tasting it over and over , making it last . Such a feeling she never had before as when she lay there looking up at the sky . The sled slipped so effortlessly over the earth , it seemed to drop away and leave her riding , drifting among the great flying clouds and the sudden blue stars that flashed out between . Once when the low western moon came out she raised her head to see the snowy countryside crusted with lighted silver . Presently the magic was darkened . Cattycornered across the sled she was aware of the cool eyes of Chancey 's sister , Mercy , fixed upon her as if upon something wicked and unclean . All the rest of the ride Rosa tried to rid that evil from herself , but it lay too deep . It seemed like some dark stain in her blood , and she could n't tear it out or scour her white flesh clean. p 336WHAT Chancey 's sister told her father about them , Rosanever knew , nor wished to know . But it must have been something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was the sheriff of Shawanee County and Judge Wheeler 's right hand man . In the parlor of his house , they said , he kept the rope of every man he had hanged and the last dishes the doomed man had eaten from . Barney Shand came to the waterfront on the softest day , the first mild day of March , a day full of the mercy of God and of the elements and of everything else save man . With winter and the snow gone , with spring in the air and the kindly sunlightlying on the sidewalks , he called at the little house behind the Red Mule , a stout man with small eyes and flabby jowls , and was alone with her mother a long time . Rosa felt herself steel when she went in the house afterward . " I know all about your going with that young Wheelerp 337to Tateville , " her mother informed her bitterly . " So does Judge Wheeler . Now he forbids you two seeing each other under the penalty of the law . " Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed outside . So there was no limit , she told herself , to the cruelty that wicked old men and women practised on innocentyoung people who never harmed anybody . It had n't been enough for them that somewhere inside of her the dark eggs of some obscure taint had been laid to spoil and set her apart from the rest . Now they had to brand her flesh , tell her what she must do and must n't , and where she must never walk or pay the penalty . All the rest of the day a strong disquiet possessed her like that of the moths caught last summer behind the windowpane . Hardly could she keep still or wait to clear early supper from the table , and when she slipped off and out into the free air , she felt like the moths must have felt when she raised the sash and let them soar . She went straight in the face of the setting sun to the Sixth Street bridge that spanned the canal , and when she got there , Chancey was waiting as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way , making as though he did n't expect her . But just the anxious desperateway he stood she knew that they had bullied him as they had her . " Do n't tell me anything ! " she begged him . Scarcely speaking , they walked out Sixth Street and took a back road into the hills . The deeper they went , the more the feel of evil and shame fell from her . Never , she thought , had the country been so beautiful as tonight after the sheriff 's call . One day or another each March she had noticed that a fine indeterminate haze hung in the air , but she could n't recall that it had ever been so delicate beforep 338or when it had given her such a grateful shelter . It was softer than smoke and dryer than fog . Indeed as the dusk deepened , it was like some mysterious and exquisite mist distilled by the gods to hide the secret and stealthy union of earth and heaven . She and Chancey walked through it tonight as if only half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was it , she told herself , it was like a dream . Through the luminous vapor the land , fields , trees and fence rows appeared as in a dream . The cries of late birds and of men and women across the fields had the same unearthly insubstantialquality . The ugly unreality of the day had dissolved . This was reality . Earthly time stood still . Even the rigs and wagons on the road moved in a curious , almost sleepy fashionwhile boys and girls standing in the lanes or outlined against the glowing red of brush fires seemed motionless , wholly under the spell . Coming back to the waterfront was like waking up in the morning to her lot , to the coarse wornout bed clothing and hearing the early tipplers grumble and cough in the saloon . Only the enchantment of this evening and their triumphover the law supported her . If Judge Wheeler and Barney Shand had n't been able to stop their happiness tonight , who would keep her and Chancey apart ? The law would only draw them closer . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resolving , sharpening , devising to protect themselves against her mother and those wicked old men . She would be cunning as the fox and watchful as the savage . Never would she and Chancey submit to such as they . And that 's the way it worked out the rest of March when the soft baby fur of the pussy willows opened to them by the tow path , and in April when the yellow daffodilsp 339bloomed in the lock tender 's garden and the white blood root in the woods where on Sundays they wandered . After May , they met on the other side of the level , in the boat yard , where they sometimes glimpsed others beside themselvesmeet like shadows and disappear into one of the long line of boats moored for repairs . More than once as she and Chancey sat rocking on the deck or in a sheltered cabin from the rain , she caught sight of a pair of eyes from an adjoining cabin staring at them . But she knew that she and Chancey were safe . Such as they would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the murky water where a catfish had come up to gasp , or hearing the endless wash of waves against the hull , Rosa could not help but think of those who had drowned here . There was the Man with the Hook . Though his arm had been lost at the elbow , his hook , they said , was just as good at work or fighting . But when he got drunk and slipped in the water , the hook was no good at all , and he never came up . Then there was Florry Hughet , who fell in too , the wife of a boatman , and Polly Baker tried to reach her with a pole . Ever afterward Thirsty Hughet used to say , " Polly Baker , you drowned my Florry with your pole . " But the worst was the Early girl who threw herself in the canal none knew where , and when they found her and fished her out , her body was covered with eels . Oh , whenever she thought of the Early girl , Rosa would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since that day . She would rather have put the waterfront behind them on their holidays , but Chancey liked the basin . He used to say that ever since he had gone down the river on the old bridge , water and boats were in his blood . Rosa did n't mind stopping with him to watch the Privateer as they called the Flour Inspector . A little man with a long hollow augurp 340like the letter , U , with a screw bit on one end , he would run it down through a barrel head and draw it out full of flour , then hold it over his bucket to sift it through his fingers . If free from specks , he branded the barrel , SUPER  --  FINE , otherwise FINE . From every boat he took home a bucket of flour . The trouble was that Chancey would stop and spend their precious hours talking to anybody they met . He liked to visit Bigger , the black who lived on his boat with a white woman and six mulatto children , and Teeny , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's day would float in the water asleep or reading the paper , his head resting on a block of wood ; and Paddy Doran , born in Ireland , who always told the same tale , how his mother was a maid of the sea and had swam up the River Shannon and shed her scales by a hay rick , and after bearing him , she had put on her scales one night and left his father , swimming out to sea again , and never had she been heard from since , so they must n't take offense if he had been drinking . Oh , Chancey was a strange one , interested in all these things . It was to gather material for his writing , he used to claim and that 's what made him curious . But what made him stubborn and willful he did n't say , or why he leaned on her like a cane . She had to stop with him and listen to all he talked to , though she 'd heard the story many times before . When summer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stand in the shadows with him and listen to the praying and preaching that Chancey ever claimed he did n't believe in . The first time Rosa heard how God told Abraham to kill his own son and sacrifice him on the fire ; when she heard that God ordered Joshua to destroy the people of Jericho and of Ai and Makkedehad and Lachish and Libnah and p 341Hebron and many other cities so that not a single man , woman or child nor even a calf or lamb had dare to remain alive ; and that all who disobeyed would go to hell and burn in pits of fire forever , Rosa put her fingers to her ears and wanted to cry out , " Liars ! Stop ! " The savage preaching , the gloomy singing , the violent praying , the threats and imprecationsdismayed her . One preacher would fall from exhaustionand another and still another took his place till a dozen had manned the pulpit . Under their unceasing fire , the people would stir and moan , cry out wordless things , throw up their arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty jerk would go among the women like the plague , their heads snapping and their hair coming down to lash and crack like bull whips in hypnotic unison . Then Rosa would close her eyes from the terrifying spectacle and not look save now and then at Chancey . There he 'd stand pale and irresolute , consumed and tortured by what he saw and heard , yet drawn and held to it like he could n't help himself . But the good of summer far outstripped the bad . What atoned for the blot of camp-meeting was God 's country and the Welsh Valley . They 'd walk up the tow path past Butterman 's Lock and cross the aqueduct over Welsh Creek . Here they 'd leave the canal for a little road that ran through a break in the hills . It was just a small narrow valley , thinly settled and full of the wild beauty of God . The road wound along the creek . At every step you had the curve of the road and the white of the water through the leaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look up the stream and down . Such particular beauty she had never seen , the long reaches of water with the trees meeting overhead , the wet mossy stones and logs below , and the clear water tumbling through. p 342Oh , she loved every minute in Welsh Valley . She liked the natives they made friends with , and the best were the Griffins , all brothers , all bachelors and never a woman over their log doorsill till she had come , they said , to bless their house . The oldest brother would show her his corn and hogs . The middle brother showed her how he wove his homespun and mixed his salt rising bread . And the youngest brother would play for her on his shepherd 's pipe , walking up and down and only stopping to tell her where he had first heard the air in the old country . She gave a little cry of pain that day in August to think that summer was almost over . Why , in June it had seemed that it would last forever . She had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . Each week , she fancied , was a little warmer than the last , July hotter than June , and Augustthan July . Then suddenly she saw the first buckwheat shocked in its dark green forester shade in the field , and a hurt gripped her heart . Why , only the corn-cutting in late September was later than buckwheat harvest . Now she held to what was left of summer with all her might , trying to hold it back , praying it to slow down and linger , that it would not pass . But in her heart she knew that winter was just ahead , that soon all the flowers , open windows , green leaves , birds and grasses would be gone . And where in the cold and snow could she and Chancey see each other then ? Even if it had n't been for the shocked buckwheat , there would have been the Sign to tell her . It had been their last day at the Griffins , such a wonderful day with the air clear as Welsh Creek water , the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling in the fields . They had stayed till late , and evening was clear with stars when they reached the aqueduct . Here they waited for a down boat to take them to town and the Basin. p 343They were sitting on the lock tender 's bench outside his cottage when it began . " Did you see it ? " asked Chancey who saw everything . " I see you , " Rosa said softly . " What else must I see ? " " It was something in the water , " he told her . She watched , and there it was in the brimming lock like he said , a streak like phosphorus this way and that . It brought to her mind the tale a riverman had told her father , that far around the curve of the earth under the Southern Cross every creature left its trail of light in the warm sea water . You need only dip your hand and see the mysteriouslight glow and sparkle . Watching now in the full lock , Rosa could almost feel herself on some far-away isle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rosa , did you see it ? " Chancey cried . She looked up and found that what she saw was not in the water but in the sky . Over the face of the heavens , stars were falling , not directly down as a stone would plunge but across like cannonballs fired from heavenly breast works . They left in their wake long trains of white fire that died slowly in the black velvet night . Most of them seemed far away , but now and then a huge bolt of blue or greenish light would flash dangerously toward them or another streak so low across the face of the earth that it seemed they must hear the hiss of its passage and the violent report when it landed . The lock keeper , aroused by their excited voices , came out to see and called his wife who looked for a brief moment and then ran back to hide her head under the bed covers . All the time the spectacle was growing stronger , grander and more terrifying . In the end the heavens appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and canal must presently be hit . In the midst of all this celestial display , a distant earthyp 344horn sounded for the lock , and a down boat loomed up calmly in the eerie light . The boy on the mules looked panic-stricken , but the tall old boatman at the helm said he had seen snow and hail that bothered him a sight worse than falling stars . He had n't heard a single splash or come on any " b'iling " water . Furthermore he wished one would come a little closer . He 'd like to catch it in a wash basin , cool it off in the " drink " and tie his rope around it for an anchor . Chancey seemed to shrink from boarding a boat whose master dared the stars to strike him , but Rosa felt a sense of strength and safety in his presence . All the way down the long ride to the Basin , she pondered what could this sign mean to her and Chancey ? That it tokened something , she felt certain , for if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the Griffins had n't asked them to stay for supper , if it had n't been the summer 's last weekend so that they agreed , and if it had n't turned out that for the longest time no boat came so that they had to wait out here on the lock tender 's bench , they would never have seen the sign . She would have been asleep in her bed and Chancey in his . But the sign spoke to both of them together , and that it was a true sign , she knew , for stars ever spoke the purest truth . The sailor on the trackless oceans sailed by them and never did they lie . Nor were they lying now . But what they said in their fearful message , neither she nor Chancey could make out . When she got home , the lamp still burned and her mother sat in her chair , her old brown shawl around her shoulders . Her eyes you could n't see behind the clouded glasses , but her face looked sharp and the mouth bitter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this ? " " Out in the country . " p 345 " Till this time in the morning ? " " I just got in . " " Who with ? " " I did n't say I was with anybody , Mama . " " What were you doing ? " insinuating , incriminating . " I was walking . " " All alone at this hour ? " " I did n't say I was alone , Mama . " " Do n't tell me you went against the law with that young hellion ? " " I do n't know who you mean , Mama . " " You know exactly who I mean  --  that degenerate Wheeler ? " " He is n't degenerate . " " So that 's who it was , was it ? " " I ca n't tell you , Mama . " " You need n't tell me , I know . " " All right , then you know , Mama . " " Do n't all-right me , Miss Rosa ! If you do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do n't tell her , either , when the law brings your sin out in court . Do n't say I did n't warn you . Never did I dream I would have a daughter like this ! " Her mother went about making herself ready for bed then , and soon her peculiar breathing rose to the loft , but Rosa in her bed could not sleep . Too much hung over her this night , her mother 's talk , the warning of the stars , the close of summer as if she had come to the end of a golden rope . But what Chancey told her before he left was the worst . It might be better if they did n't see each other for a while , he had said . The coming week he would be busy . The week after that was the Americus fair , and never dare they be seen together in front of so many people . Rosap 346was n't sure that she heard him right at first . Then something like a wheel stopped inside of her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specter by her side . Was it going to be like last fall and winter , she kept asking herself . Was it truly the end of summer then , and was this the start of his forsaking her and perhaps of their final parting ? When a week went by and not a sight of his thin unforgettableface , Rosa turned at last to her other self for aid . Always before had this other self helped her . Who or what it was , she did n't altogether know , save it might be her conscience or the self she might have been had her hopes had their way , for its qualities were nearly all those she had not . No matter how upset she could be , her other self was always cool and unalarmed , as much as to say to her , very well , it 's all right , go and do it then if you must , the world wo n't come to an end . Sometimes when in great emotion or pain , Rosa thought her other self calloused and aloof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , she thought , if needles could pierce its fingers or its back ache , then it would soon learn to have more pity and feeling . Just the same it was a comfort and a friend , like an older , sometimes difficult but infinitely wiser sister whose counsel was ever open to her . But tonight when Rosa turned to it for help , no other self was there . Never had this happened up to now . Why , she could n't recall the time when it had not been ready with an answer . It shared her every thought and feeling . Indeed she always fancied it part of herself and that when she died , it would have to die with her . How then could it have vanished while she was still alive ? In faint panic she turned , calling within herself and then , still in her mind , to the spaces about her . No answer came , no feel or intimationof that familiar and dependable presence , no character-p 347istic words of advice or rebuke rising in her mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void , empty of life , one that had never known her existence . If only she could talk five minutes with Chancey ! What a bitter thing that never could she see him or share his companyup town like other young folks , but must meet him by stealth down here at the waterfront behind boats and people 's backs . She would not endure , she told herself , such a life of disgrace and debasement any longer . Often had Chancey talked to her of leaving Americus . They could go to Cincinnati or Indiana , he said , and start anew . No one would know them there or care . They could live their own lives without interference or dishonor . But always when he begged , she had held back from such cruel leavetakingof her family , never to sec her mother or brothers again , not even to let them know she was still alive . Now she had waked up with a shock . God give her another chance , and she would in a moment leave them all behind . Hardly could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their new life together . Such a week she hoped never to live through again as this last . Monday and Tuesday of the new week were interminable . Wednesday she grew hopeless , and Thursday desperate . Friday she told herself she could hold back no longer . By noon the waterfront looked almost deserted . Every one else had gone to see the balloon ascension , the great bag and its fearless rider mount the sky . Under the silent accusinggaze of her mother , she washed and dressed in the brown dress that Chancey like best . Then she took the precious gold piece from her keepsake box and slipped out into Dock Street . If she were blind , she thought , she could find her way today . The great voice of the fair drew her , like the voice ofp 348the sea she had never heard but always hoped to . Could this be Brown 's field where the peaceful white cows had grazed all summer , this city of booths and stands , of tents and enclosures , of the calls of show folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drums all playing furiously ! The rich booths stood laden with goods and trinkets . She could smell the frying fish and warm pop corn of the stands , the pickles and mustard . Men dipped from tubs of lemonade and from huge black kettles of coffee . Outside the tents , posters and barking men pictured the marvelous sights within . But today she had no taste for the giant giraffe , or the snowy bear , or the hairy woman from Abyssinia or the dreadful Turk who swallowed fire . For small silver she could have heard David 's Pedal Harp played by one of his descendants or the Campanologians , the Swiss Bell Ringers , in rusty coats , red boots and blue pantaloons , their caps with white plumes and a bell in either hand . She could have seen rope dancers , sapient and performing brutes , the wax figures of Cain and Abel and of Delilah cutting the hair of Samson . But all that mattered today was Chancey . From every part of the fair she could see the monstrous bag of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents , straining with the breeze on its slender rope mooring . All day it had carried people fifty or a hundred yards into the sky . For two dollars each a pair of passengers could ride and see the world as a bird saw it . Then the balloonist 's crew would pull them down . Four times she came back to the balloon without finding Chancey . The fifth time there he was , climbing into the basket . " Oh , Chancey ! " she cried aloud before she thought . " Take me with you ! " By the look on his face she knew she had made a mistakep 349in front of all the people . The balloonist looked at her coldly , guessing something was wrong . " The aeronaut par excellence " Chancey in the Centinel had called him , and he looked it , dressed in black jersey trunks and slippers . " You can go up later , Miss , " he said . " But I must go with him ! " she testified , trying to reach the basket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said sternly , barring her way , hoping to put her off , but her hand in her purse quickly found the gold piece . Even when she stood in the basket , Chancey kept his face turned away as if he had never known her . " Oh , Chancey , could n't you give me one small sign that you saw me before ! " she wanted to say to him but never would she till they were free from the crowd . Now would n't you think that this aerial car would feel foreign to her , but her shoes seemed to find firm and familiar footing among the sacks of sand and among the extra ballast of blackened iron that lay in broken scattered pieces on the floor of the basket , broken stove plates , pieces of chimney rods and the rusty heads of two eelspears . The crew was letting out the rope now , and the bag surged upward like some live celestial thing eager to return to its world . She could feel her and Chancey rising , the heavy ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effortless lightness of being . So this was how it felt , she whispered to herself , to leave Americus ? Never if she could help it , would she ever return again . How long they let her and Chancey up in God 's free air , she did n't know , but the time must have been very short . She could hardly believe it was over when she felt them starting to pull the basket down . Why , scarcely had she time to say the first word to him . He still stood silent , stiffp 350and obdurate . She could see the upturned faces of the crowd waiting cruelly below . Must she now go back and face them , return to the heavy air of Americus , to the smell of frying fish , to the crowded little house behind the Red Mule saloon and her mother 's mouldy chair ! It looked like such a slender little rope that pulled them down . Where it pressed the rim of the basket , the hard-woven willow and many winds had frayed it . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give way . Only a touch , and she and Chancey could go where he had so long wished , not to return again . Never had she known her hand to do such a swiftly reckless and irresponsible thing before . Chancey 's back was still turned , but she thought she felt him give a start at the lightened jerk of the basket . Then he must have looked at her when it was too late , with the rusty bit of eelspear head safely out of sight in her bosom and the parted rope falling unseen below . The quick bag had leaped like an uprushing pheasant . It took a moment for the cry of the crowd to reach them . Then it came like a storm on the already distant earth . What the look must be on Chancey 's face , she could only faintly guess . She was alone with him now , and such a sensation came up in her as she had not known since ridingthe sled last winter and coursing in fancy among the clouds . Her hands held tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had let go and was flying free . Was this how birds felt , she wondered . Heavy and awkward on the ground , with what ease they spread their wings and returned to the sky . Over their heads the buoyant bag rode magnificently , the basket swinging in stately rhythm below . They were racing toward a high golden cloud . Below and beyond on the eastern horizon , a fleet of small white cloud boats sailed in 351a turquoise sea . Looking down , she could see the earth still falling away from them . Already they had left the fairgroundsbehind them , the cross lines of Americus and the green square where Chancey lived . Around such were tied the wide and narrow ribbons of river and canal , white with sky , and the round blob of basin and level . That smudge of gray near it must hold Dock Street and her mother 's ugly little house although she could not see it . Never , she told herself , would she sec it again . Let God blow them eastward now , over fields and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide Ohio and on to the mountains and Philadelphia where her mother 's people had lived in respect and decency so long . But she had n't reckoned on Chancey . When first she turned to smile courage to him , his face was yellow with fear and he crouched back in the basket where he need not see how high and far they had gone . But now he was on his legs , grim and atremble . One hand gripped the basket rim . The other hunted for something overhead in the nipple of the bag . Suddenly she saw he had hold of a red cord and it flashed through her mind that this must be something the balloonist had told him about for his piece in the Centinel . " No , Chancey ! Do n't ! " she screamed , but her cry was lost in the wind and sky . She saw him pull the cord so hard that it tore out in his hands . Almost at once the great bag above them reeled like a stricken thing . Life seemed to bleed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightness of her body fled from her . She felt her old weight return and with Chancey 's bear down on basket and bag , forcing them to the ground . The golden cloud no longer seemed akin to her , and she knew now she would never reach the horizon to sail with all those small white boatlike clouds floating in a turquoise sea . Shep 352looked down . The strong sweep from earth was irretrievablylost . The earth 's face came up to meet them , a broad heavy face marked with the shapeless features of fields and brush patches . Looking back she could see on the last rim of earth before the sky , a faint dot that was the city . Hardly had they even got away from Americus . Someone with sharp eyes or a telescope at the fairgrounds must have seen them falling from the heavens like a dark burned-out star . The bag caught in a fence row of trees between two patches of swamp land . They had to climb down as best they could , watched by a farm boy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night when the first team from Americus reached them . In the second were the balloonist and Sheriff Shand . Rosa thought she knew at last what it meant to come to the end of things . She would have to go back to Americus now . She felt herself an old woman next morning walking into her mother 's kitchen . Could it be that ever she had lived here ? It seemed like some small , crowded and airless cave . " So you thought you 'd run off ? " her mother greeted her grimly . " The rope was nearly worn through , " Rosa faltered . " Yes , but the rest was cut , they say . Did you or that young hellion cut it ? " And at Rosa 's silence , " Where 's the knife ? " " I do n't know any knife , Mama . " " You do n't need to tell me anything . I know . I told you what would happen to you if you did n't watch out . Do you know what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't and I do n't want to , Mama . " " It 's all over town , " her mother informed her . " You know that dead baby they found on Pine Street Wednesdayp 353morning . It was wrapped in a dirty Centinel . ' Well , they say that was yours and young Wheeler 's baby ! " Rosa stood very still . Her head felt numb . It seemed that she must move her brain with her hand to think . A little later she caught a glimpse of herself in the glass . Her face looked shapeless , lifeless , like the stricken bag of the fallen balloon. p 354C HANCEY did n't believe it when they told him . Of course , he knew that news traveled fast in Americus . More than once when his mother served him breakfast , she had told him something that had happened since he had gone to bed the night before . But this Saturday morning she said nothing , only gazed at him with her tight mouth and the cruel look in her eyes that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thought he did , her bitterness over what had happened in front of everybody at the fairgroundsyesterday , that he and Rosa had brought out into the open the ugly thing about his father that had been buried so long . What his mother did n't know , nor would he tell her , was how little he had to do with it . The whole thing had just happened to him . He had gone alone and unsuspecting into the basket . It was really Rosa who was responsible and to blame. p 355All the way to the Centinel office he went over the incidentin his mind , checking it step by step , and it only proved his contention , even though he could never come out and say so . Mr. Lane looked up at him searchingly when he came in . A tall spare man , his hair hung down behind his ears , and a stained black stock crossed around his stand-up collar . His thin face was mostly bone , the foreheadseamed with parallel lines , his mouth wide and his eyes sunken pits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which still followed you about from his portrait hung on the court house wall . He seemed to be writing unusually savagely this morning , Chancey thought , his fingers holding a very thick pencil , the whole arm moving from elbow to fingers , makingsharp dots and dashes . When done , he held the long foolscap sheet up to read , but he turned and spoke to Chancey instead . " You want me to write the news column today ? " " Why , no , sir , " Chancey felt surprised . The deep eyes did not spare him . " You 've heard the news ? " " I do n't know what news you mean , sir . " The fierceness on the editor 's face dissolved , leaving his head like a kind of skull . " Well , I 'm sorry to be the one to tell you . Your little friend , the Tench girl , died last night . She took her own life . They found the body this morning . " That was when for the moment Chancey could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hand ! It could n't possibly be and yet inside of him he felt all his blame against her collapse suddenly like a house of cards . Mr. Lane 's face was inscrutable . For a time he held it stiff and grave , as if this was a moment of importance , of dignity to the dead , orp 356perhaps he could n't find the exact words he wanted to say . He went on finally . " We can say nothing of that in the paper , of course . Merely state that the deceased met her death at her mother 's home early this morning , exact time unknown . Everybody knows about it anyway . I understand the whole town is shocked by the details . " Chancey stood there rigid and confused . What were these shocking details , part of him cried out to know , but the rest of him closed its ears and would hear nothing . He felt Mr. Lane 's eyes search him but whether with pity or scorn , he had no means of telling . It would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole story then instead of filling his mind with horror and uncertainty of the unknown . He tried to prepare himself by fearing the worst , but it turned out to be so much worse than he had dreamed . He could n't escape it anyway . Everywhere he went that day he heard snatches of the cruel talk and exclamations . " You 'd reckon she 'd throw herself in the canal , would n't you , sooner than make such a mess ! " " It was an old eelspear head she done it with . They said it was honed sharp as a razor . " " That was something to see , for fair , the blood dripping down through the loft boards . It turned my stomach . I could n't eat a bite of dinner . " " She done it after she went to bed and was that quiet , nobody in the house heard a blessed thing . " " If it was n't true what they said about her , what did she ever do it for ? Folks do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That old witch ! Do you reckon she 'll go out of the house now to the funeral ? " p 357 " Did n't you think it queer , the blood dripping down on her own mother ? You suppose she done it on purpose like that ? Anyway , it gave me the creeps when I started to think about it . " " Dr. Keller said she was all cut up . He did n't see how a body could cut their own self that way . He said it looked exactly like she thought she had something wrong inside of her and was trying to cut it out . But he could n't find a thing the matter with her . " All the time Chancey went about his work , while he set down the facts that Miss Martha Fuller and Mr. Mayhugh Jones were united in holy matrimony in the First Methodist Church , or while he wrote an advertisement for Mr. Wells , the storekeeper , " Do n't mind loud cries of others but call and you shall see more new goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enterprise on Water Street , " the ugly words about Rosa were the ones he kept writing over and over in his mind . Now he felt sickened by his own treatment of her at the farm house . Could that have been only evening before last ? Something inside of him struggled and fought to reach across that short space of time , trying to get back to Rosa still alive when he could make everything all right . Even then , he remembered , that through his sullenness , Rosa had stayed her own gentle self . It must have dashed her hopes to the ground to have to go back to Americus , to her mother and their shabby house on Dock Street , and yet she had been the one who had tried to cheer him . He remembered now the strange thing she had told him that evening , but then Rosa was always telling him strange things . He was not to worry too much , she said , about her not getting away from Americus . Now that she had seen him again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getp 358away to her secret places . He knew what those words meant . One of her " secret places " was the canal . More than once as they walked the tow path or stood on the bridge , especially on a clear day , she had pointed to the world of reflection in the water . " At first it looks upside down , " she had said . " But if you look at it long enough , it changes around and our world up here is the one that 's upside down . See the sky down there ! It 's just like the sky up here , but is n't it lighter and softer and a more beautiful blue ? And the trees and grass ! Everything 's so peaceful and free down there . When I go down in it , I feel I 'm getting back to a wonderful place I know . " " It 's just your imagination , " he had told her . " You can never really go down there . " " Oh , yes , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . " " With my body , " she had insisted . " I can move my arms like I 'm swimming and float right over those trees . " " It 's impossible , " he had told her sharply . " If your body went down there , you 'd get wet and drown . " That had stopped her for a moment , and her face went grave . " If I do n't go down with this body , " she had said slowly , " then I must go down with some other body that 's just as good as this one . " It had made him angry at the time but now it only gave him pity , like the pity you feel for a child , while recurrent tingles ran along his spine . He cursed his own stupidity . If he had n't been sullen and blind the other evening , he might have known of what dark things she was thinking . Tonight as he tramped the dark streets everything that Rosa ever said or did came up in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could see her lying slight and still in that little dark house , dressed in her green or brown silk , while rough hands sopped her white face and her small folded hands with baking-soda water . That night he scarcely closed his eyes , and in the morning nothing could have kept him from her burial . Oh , never would he dared to go to it directly . By a devious route he went to the waterfrontand stood around the corner from the Wizard-of -- the-Dell 's cabin . There he waited till he saw the six young women in white dresses come out of the front door of the saloon . They were bearing the unpainted diamond-shaped coffin to the Basin delivery wagon . Cold and sweating , Chancey watched the stream of mourners follow . Everybody , he thought , was there , everybody but her real father and her Wheeler half brothers and sisters . In life they had ignored her and in death deserted her . Of all that side of the family , only himself attended , and that by stealth , sneaking cowardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Wheelers were , he told himself , as movingby different streets he followed the funeral down along the canal , across to the river and the little old cemetery they called the Devil 's Acre . Here a jockey had been buried , a gambler , some bad women , a few Negroes , several men and women who had been hung or who had hung or drowned themselves or had otherwise placed themselves beyond the pale . Among them Rosa had to lie . Had it been out in the country he might have forgiven it , but here the shabby fringes of the city had grown around it , shutting it in . Coarse uncut river grass covered it , hiding the sunken graves and the few board markers , most of them flat and rotting on the ground . Chancey thought he had never seen such a pitiful sight as that group of mourners and white pallbearers standing for a few minutes in grieved attentionp 360before leaving Rosa to her desolation . From time to time the words of the preacher , some of whose beliefs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later Chanceycould see yellow clay flung into the air . Not until all had gone , preacher , singers , pallbearers , mourners , the tag end and curious , Ed Malcolm 's delivery wagon and finally the gravediggers themselves , their shovels on their shoulders , did Chancey go over and stand close by that bleeding mound of earth . Only then he realized that he had n't even brought flowers . At the thought of her lying down there in the wet ground , with the desolate scene above and the bleakness of winter coming on , such a feeling went over him that he did n't believe he could endure it . It must pass , he told himself , for time heals all things , but day after day it never did . When he woke in the night , it was there . What he would have done without his work at the Centinel , he never knew . He seldom read in print what he wrote or remembered it afterward . But it was something to hold on to and lose himself in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he answered strangely and of the silent watchers at home when he came stumbling in . But none of them spoke to him about what lay like lead in his breast , none but his mother and he shut his ears to her as if he had n't heard and climbed the stairs to his room . One of them must have spoken to someone else , for Dr. Shotwell , the family minister , sent Chancey word that he wanted to see him . Half unwillingly , half in faint secret hope , he went across the square . There had been a church standing on the corner ever since he could remember . When he was a little fellow , it had been frame , and before that , something else . Now it was of brick , the biggest church in the city and with the greatestcongregation , a huge structure with wide steps runningp 361up to a portico , with three front doors topped by carved fan lights and four huge white fluted pillars . There were two rows of white windows all around , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so far that God help the people around there if it ever blew down . From its belfry on a clear day you could see Tateville , and once when the wind was right , it was claimed they heard the bell out there , although many doubted . Anyhow , it was a long way from the first little log church that had stood there not much bigger than a cabin , his mother said . The maid took him in , and Dr. Shotwell met him at the door of his study , a tall dour looking preacher with iron gray hair curling up defiantly on the top of his head . His low collar showed the strong sinews of his neck . The black tie had been furled with carelessness and melancholy . His face was gentle and forgiving , and yet the heavy eyebrows told that on principles he was uncompromising . He talked to Chancey a long time about his poems and newspaper writing , then he took him down and outside where he produced a heavy key and unlocked the church door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fierce tenderness . " I want you to bare your head in your own church . It 's been a long time since you were here and that 's a reproach to your Maker . Your family is responsible for this church in the first place . Your mother gave the land . Your grandmotherlies , the first silent inhabitant of the churchyard . Your brother heads the council , a fine man and our next governor , everybody says . Your sisters and their families attend . It would make us all very happy if you could see the light and come , too . We have missed you , but whether you realize it or not , my lad , you have missed us too , and the peace and blessedness of giving up sin and the world . "
