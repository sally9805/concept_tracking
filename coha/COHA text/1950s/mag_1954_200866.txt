Carmen Jones ( Otto Preminger ; 20th Century-Fox ) . The rattle of the cash register does not often serve as the drum roll of social progress . With this picture it may . Otto Preminger 's Hollywood version of Billy Rose 's Broadway version of Georges Bizet 's grand opera seems sure to be a big hit . It also seems likely that the picture will fling somewhat wider the gates of opportunity for Negro entertainers in Hollywood . For in this picture the actors present themselves not merely as racial phenomena but as individuals , and they put across a Carmen that may blister the rear walls of many a movie house . <P> All this is the more remarkable because the very idea of doing a black Carmen is a pretty obvious device for converting color into coin . Furthermore , there is a musical objection to the scheme . Bizet wrote French romantic music that , as many critics feel , is hardly even suitable to its original Spanish subject . With back-country U.S. Negroes , it goes about as well as pink champagne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammerstein II dipped his big toe in the Mississippi mud and wrote some lyrics that should be thrown back to the catfish . Fortunately , he also supplied a book that is considerably better than the original libretto , with a shift of the plot to Jacksonville , Fla. , and into high colloquial gear . <P> Carmen Jones ( Dorothy Dandridge ) is a fold girl in a parachute factory during World War II . She has every man of the military guard wrapped up-every one except Corporal Joe ( Harry Belafonte ) , who loves Cindy Lou ( Olga James ) . But one day Carmen gets in a hair-tearing fight with another working girl , and off to the pokey she goes with Corporal Joe . On the way she lures the corporal beyond the call of duty , and escapes . <P> When Joe gets out of the guardhouse , Carmen gets the poor boy into hot water again , and leaves him to stew in it while she joins the camp-following of Husky Miller ( Joe Adams ) , the heavyweight champ . The green-eyed monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At its best , the original Carmen is pattern passion : a rose , a flame and a blade , woven into drama as formal as a Spanish dance . In Carmen Jones the dance is a ring of savages in firelight , jumping any way the devil pulls the strings , terrible and beautiful and simple as God 's chillun without their wings . <P> Energy , in fact , is the essence of this picture ; the audience is not merely stimulated , it is all but electrocuted . Even the huge CinemaScope screen seems hardly big enough to carry the mass scenes . And yet , through the pelt of colors and the whirl of action , Carmen herself holds the eye-like a match burning steadily in a tornado . Actress Dandridge employs to perfection the method of the coquette : by never giving more than she has to , she hints that she has more than she has given-and sometimes even more than she really has to give .                   @ @
