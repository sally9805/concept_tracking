New York 's Chancellor Robert Livingston , representing the law that preceded , underpinned and nourished the Constitution , administered the oath to the big , embarrassed man in the brown suit with eagles on its metal buttons . Then George Washington , painfully striving to strike exactly the right pitch on history 's tuning fork , delivered on April 30 , 1789 the first address by a President of the United States to the Congress . " The propitious smiles of Heaven , " he said , " can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right , which Heaven itself has ordained . . . the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered , perhaps , as deeply , as finally , staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the American people . " <P> A generation now aging dismissed this as bombast . A generation now living knows it so familiarly as sober truth that the excitement and suspense posed by Washington is lost . This week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress of the U.S. , will his words carry this sense of American responsibility for freedom attained through regard for " the eternal rules of order " ? <P> <P> Not unless there is a change of tone in the great conversation between the American people and their leaders , a conversation overheard ( as George Washington knew it would be ) by all the world . Willingly , the people have done all that was asked of them by the leaders . Ably , Dwight Eisenhower and his Secretary of State have applied American principles to scores of crises around the globe . But each crisis has been met within the limits of its own circumstances . The leaders have not ade quately connected the crises one to another with the sweep of America 's suspenseful destiny . <P> For common denominator , present U.S. policy depends on the clownish heirs of a corrupt and disorderly daydream . If the U.S. makes sense to the world in January 1956 , it can thank not Robert Livingston and George Washington but Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin . It reacts , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does it present to the world an idea of order ? <P> <P> As President Eisenhower prepares this week 's State of the Union Message , the time is overripe for a new translation of the American theme-freedom through order . Does it make contemporary sense that Europe continues as a fractured continent , no part of which is able to sustain industrial mass production or even to defend itself ? Does it make sense that Arabs and Israelis continue to defy the law by prolonging a quarrel that neither can win ? Does it make sense that Asia , wishing only for national freedom and economic progress , is allowed to drift toward slavery and reaction ? <P> George Washington 's " eternal rules of order and right , which Heaven itself has ordained , " are not clauses in the constitution of Utopia . They have another name : common sense . The U.S. has the duty and the power to pursue common sense in the world . It would have that duty and power even if Communism had never existed . It will be blamed if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more justly-if it does not carry out its mission .
