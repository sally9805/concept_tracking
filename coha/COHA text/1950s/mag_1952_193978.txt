MOST famous cinema stars have , at one time or another , placed their hands &; feet in a block of wet cement in the courtyard of Grauman 's Chinese Theater in Hollywood , thereby receiving some desirable publicity and , after the cement has hardened , attaining a certain immortality . The only columnist who has been so honored is Louella Oettinger Parsons . <P> This is not surprising . Her movie column has sometimes been the object of abuse and ridicule , her radio voice is uncomfortably nervous and high-pitched , she herself has not always been the subject of affectionate comment , and many competitors , including that spectacularly be-hatted warrior , Hedda Hopper , have tried to beat her at her own game . But in 1952 Louella Parsons , after reigning over a quarter century , is still queen of the Hollywood gossip columnists . Her work appears daily in twelve Hearstpapers and is syndicated in some 1,200 others throughout the world . She is held in awe , respect , esteem , fear or terror , as the case may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion pictures . Every producer , director and actor reads her column in the Los Angeles Examiner every morning , and each knows that all the others are reading it . That makes everybody happy . It also makes Louella a Very Important Person . <P> In her autobiography , The Gay Illiterate , she wrote that her first husband , John Parsons of Dixon , Ill. , " knew of my ambition to write and urged me to study Thomas Hardy . . . Unfortunately , the exposure did n't take . Nothing of the Hardy style has ever seeped through my pronouncements . " <P> She long ago developed a style all her own , as distinguishable as searchlights at a Hollywood premiere . She has a real talent for using a cliche in precisely the right place , she never avoids phrases like " the reason is because " unless it is impossible not to do so , and she likes her infinitives split . Louella is aware of these oddities and will talk about them frankly , explaining that she types so badly that it is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictates , she does so at a terrific pace . The result is a chatty , intimate , informal , verbose and , on the whole , knowledgeable hodgepodge . <P> MANY people have tried to explain the extraordinary success of Louella Parsons . The story has gone the rounds for years that , as she puts it in her autobiography , she was " supposed to know ' something ' " - presumably about her boss , William Randolph Hearst , whom she steadfastly revered through the 29 years she worked for him . Careful research has still to uncover any evidence to support this legend . <P> The Parsons success may be attributed to a combination of circumstances . She wrote her first movie column for the Chicago Record-Herald in 1914 . She enriched her experience by working for three years on the Morning Telegraph , a New York racing and theater sheet , and then , starting in 1922 , for Hearst 's New York American . Her husband had died , and she was supporting their young daughter Harriet , who is now a producer in Hollywood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuberculosis and Hearst shipped her to recuperate , on full salary , to an unknown California town called Palm Springs . When she went back to work a year later , Hearst ordered her to stay on in Hollywood , and his paper began syndicating her column . Louella was on her way .
