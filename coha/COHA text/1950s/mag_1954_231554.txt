Lunatics and Lovers ( by Sidney Kingsley ) represents a new venture-into farce - for the author of Men in White , Dead End and Detective Story . But , though it certainly has its good points , there is nothing new about Lunatics and Lovers itself . The scene is a farce-hallowed Broadway hotel suite sprinkled with hotel sweeties . People constantly enter and exit , there are confabs and wisecracks , phone calls and flunkeys and cops . Some of the characters are crooked , others are crocked ; the talk is extremely lowdown , and the lust unbounded . Nothing could be socially less conventional or theatrically more so . <P> Playwright Kingsley , who perhaps sees life more in terms of character actors than of any other one thing , has created some lively parts and , with the help of his own deft staging , has achieved some entertaining performances . Particular bright spots are Buddy Hackett as a fat racketeer , Dennis King as a spouting and swilling judge , Mary Anderson as a wronged wife out on a bender , and Vicki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrived some funny scenes , including one of a cutie ( Sheila Bond ) keeping open house while taking a bubble bath . <P> <P> But for all its sedulous devotion to the raffish , the evening is not entirely a success : there are ups and downs and starts and stops . Fine when it is funny , the play goes flat when it is all too strenuously trying to be . The flesh is weak in Lunatics and Lovers , and at times the inspiration seems even weaker . And hand in hand with a good pungent coarseness in the characters themselves goes a certain touch of vulgarity in the treatment of them . Nor , for all its lowdownness , is Lunatics and Lovers quite to the gutter born , with a truly deep-seated sense of <P> Let them cant about decorum Who have characters to lose . <P> <P> Boy Meets Siren , but winds up happily in wifey 's arms ; and the tough guy , it turns out is all custard filling underneath . Perhaps one reason why Lunatics and Lovers keeps straining so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really playing safe . <P> <P> Witness for the Prosecution ( by Agatha Christie ) is Broadway 's first really bright evening of crime since Dial " M " for Murder . In an age of dwindling stage whodunits ( there are n't even many bad ones ) , the expert Miss Christie has fetched up another of her tidy yarns , tossed in a finely conducted English courtroom trial , and has then , when all is over , overturned it all with not one shattering twist but three . <P> <P> A young man is arrested for the murder of a rich spinster who had just made him her heir . His alibi is that he was at home when the murder was committed-which his wife will bear witness to . But at the trial the wife-who , it turns out , is not really his wife-repudiates his story . At this point things really start humming , but at this point must be enforced the First Commandment for whodunits : thou shalt not tell . <P>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
