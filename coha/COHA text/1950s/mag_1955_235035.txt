When Ballet Theater first bounced on the scene 15 years ago , it called itself " a museum of the dance . " The label was meant to indicate that all styles , old and new , would be on exhibit . Over the years , the lively museum gave U.S. ballet a new turn : it kicked new life into the mummified remains of classical ballet ( which it performed with loving care ) and pioneered an electric , freshly dramatic modern style . Last week , to wind up its15th anniversary celebration , Ballet Theater gathered its stars and most famous graduates , moved into Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House for a three-week run before touring New England , Mexico and South America . Along with some traditional specimens ( Giselle , Swan Lake ) , the repertory included such milestones in U.S. ballet evolution as Agnes de Mille 's Fall River Legend ( the Lizzie Borden case ) , Jerome Robbins ' Fancy Free ( three sailors on shore leave ) , Eugene Loring 's Billy the Kid ( life and death of the killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibits proved far from musty . Standouts : Nora Kaye , 35 , who returned to the company ( after four years with the New York City Ballet ) to revive the famed Pillar of Fire , in which she dances Hagar , the girl who is bitterly afraid of becoming an old maid . When the curtain parted to show Hagar sitting on her house steps , feet together , head and shoulders agonizingly tense , the audience burst into applause : Ballerina Kaye created the part in 1942 , and nobody else has ever danced it . Pillar of Fire ( set to Schoenberg 's Verklarte Nacht ) established her as a unique dancing actress who brought new depth to ballet . Last week Ballerina Kaye danced the part with the same old tragic fervor . Pillar 's British Choreographer Antony Tudor , 46 , who was originally " curator " of the company 's Modern English wing , was on hand last week to dance the part of Hagar 's beloved .

Guest Ballerina Alicia Markova , 44 , who has been a star ever since the days when a ballerina without a Russian name was no ballerina at all ( she was born Alicia Marks , in London ) . A veteran of Sadler 's Wells and of Ballet Theater itself , Ballerina Markova floated through such romantic favorites as Les Sylphides and Romeo and Juliet with an airy grace that has never lost its charm . Igor Youskevitch , 43. had the audience gasping , with his handsome bounds and dizzy spins in confections such as pas de deux from Nutcracker and Swan Lake . Russian-born Danseur Noble Youskevitch , who was an aspiring Olympic gymnast when he turned to ballet in 1932 , is one of the world 's greatest male classical dancers . Last week he also leaped into a dramatic role : Stanley Kowalski , in Valerie Bettis ' version of A Streetcar Named Desire . Dancer Youskevitch happily strutted his muscular way through the gloomy scenes , less expressive but considerably more agile than the dramatic version 's Marlon Brando . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his most popular part , the cockiest sailor in Fancy Free , which had the audience giggling merrily , and as the lovelorn doll in Petrouchka , which had it misty-eyed.
