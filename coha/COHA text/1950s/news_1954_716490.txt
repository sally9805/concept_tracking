txt How to sell a " model home " paint and repair job  --  and what happened to each of three householders who bought one  --  was told in detail yesterday at a Senate investigation of irregularities in the Federal , Housing Administration . The hearing ; conducted by Senator Prescott Bush , Connecticut Republican , at the Astor Hotel , brought out that high-pressure salesmen earned more in signing one prospect than the actual cost of the job plus the contractor 's profit . Witnesses told of inferior painting and shingling . They told of certificates of " completion " being signed before the work had even started . They acknowledged the use of texts advising the salesman to act like a " mathematical genius " while convincing the prospect of the " saving " in store for him . One man who ' admitted preparing such literature insisted its application was only " good selling . " In all instances , the implication was that the contractor 's primary aim was to get the signatures from the customer essential to selling the customer 's note to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing for the debt under Title One of the Federal Housing Law . Aim Is to ' Correct ' the Law One long-range purpose of the hearings , in which Senator Bush is Sitting as one member of the fifteen-man Committee on Banking and Currency , is to " correct " ' the law to-curb abuses , the Senator said . Stringent new administrative regulations to this end were announced by the F. H. A. on Wednesday . Senator Bush ' said the Attorney General , through the Federal Bureatt of Investigation , would be asked to locate a Queens builder who disappeared on Aug. 18 after being told he could not postpone his testimony before the committee . The missing man , David Kent of 291 Exeter Street , Brooklyn , failed to respond to a subpoena yesterday . He is now wanted to appear on Sept. 27 . He was identified with the Dorie Miller housing project in Queens . The committee subpoenaed the books of Abraham Traub , attorney , of 16 Court Street , Brooklyn , for presentation at the hearing this morning . Mr. Traub handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Testimony on Wednesday indicated that in this case a $15,000 investment had yielded a $4,000 , - 000 profit . Yesterday Senator Bush chided Mr. Traub as uncooperative after the lawyer had declined to do more than continue to make the books available at the office of his counsel , 1501 Broadway . Two more cases of windfalls based on big insured Government mortgages on multiple-dwelling projects in Queens were unfolded under sharp questioning by Sen- , ator Bush , William Simon , chief committee counsel , and committee aides . In one case , two brothers with three corporations originally capitalized at $1,000 each were able to distribute $500,000 in : " dividends " to themselves out of a " surplus " that , Mr. Simon charged , was " created " deliberately by a private re-appraisal so as to conform with the law on distribution of dividends . ' Completed ' ? on Paper The first witness on the Title One phase of the inquiry was Jerome Brett of East Orange , N. J. , who said he was a salesman of home improvements . From 1941-52 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company of Newark . Richard Hogue , assistant committee counsel , asked if it was not true that the Government " completion " certificate often was obtained by the salesman " before the work was even commenced . " " It 's possible it could have been , " Mr. Brett replied . The counsel cited a case in Lodi , N. J. , where the salesman had received $319 although " par "  - -  cost plus profit  --  was only $291 . Mr. Simon asked if Mr. Brett had not filled orders in many cases where the salesman earned at least twice " par . " " It 's possible , " said Mr. Brett , in some discomfort . It developed that the Pioneer Home Improvement Company had gone into bankruptcy in 1952 . ' Senator Bush wanted to know why . " A product that we had been using proved to be deficient  --  al spray paint , " the witness narrat- , ed . " The complaints came in . Wel tried to make the jobs right  --  as many as we could . It caught up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no more money . " Charles Blume , attorney for Mr. Brett , tried to stave off inquiry into the bankruptcy , but Senator Bush permitted the direct question as to whether Mr.1 Brett had withdrawn funds froml the company in the ten months before the bankruptcy and used them personally , though entering them in the books as expenses . " Yes , " said the witness , in a low voice . A Bonus of Headaches The three householders who ran , afoul of sharp practice in the , Title One field were Raymond ' S. Hobson , a post office clerk , of 187-45 Mangin Avenue , Hollis , Queens ; Mrs. John Blystad of 136 Court House Road , Franklin Square , L. L , and Louis Maiorano of 620 North Wyoming Street , Hazleton , Pa . Mr. Hobson told of being talked into a $1,060 job by an agent of Approved Home Developers . The salesman used the " model " or " demonstration " home approach . That meant , it was said , that . the job would be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospects ; that it would carry a ten to fifteen-year guarantee ; and that Mr. Hobson would get a $50 bonus for every other sale made on the basis of his place as an example . He signed " several papers in a pile . " Then the painting of the eaves and the house trim was left undone . The garage got a primary coat and the painters never returned . Complaints were futile . But Mr. Hobson said he ? was still paying the bank $33.46 a month on the note . Mrs. Blystad was another prospect of Approved Home Developers . A salesman used the model house approach on her , too ? from 9 P. K to 1 A. M. ? arguing that so many people would follow her example that her $50 commissions would mean " the job wo n't : oust you a cent , " she recounted . She signed up for $1,500 worth of work . When her son , Charles , came home at 1:30 A. M. , he told her a number of neighbors had been " gypped " and urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company next day , but got only threats to sue to enforce the contract . The upshot was that she had to pay a lawyer $150 and settle with the company for $200 ? for absolutely no work . Mr. Maiorano had been victimized by a group identified as Keystone Home Improvement Company . A photo showed his home , with the siding off in three ugly black patches . He said he dead signed for $747 , that the siding was put up with the flimsiest aluminum and with tar-paper nails , and the wind tore it right off . Louis Samuel Garthson of 7305 Boulevard East , North Bergen . now a 50 per cent stockholder in a group called Creative Home Makers Modernizers of New Jersey , acknowledged having been interested in the preparation of the brochure for salesmen . Mr. Garthson also testified that he previously had been a salesman for Pioneer Home Improvement Company . Charles E. Sells , an assistant , counsel for the committee , read this excerpt from the text on salesmanship : " After you 've completed your measurements , using your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttering and talking to yourself in compiling all figures . You are the mathematical genius , remember , and you act the part . " " What would you call that ? " Mr. Sells asked the witness . " Good selling . " As a witness for the second day , Mr. Traub testified primarily as to his personal indebtedness ? between $1,500,000 and $1,600,000 to the late Philip Schoenfeld , a mortgage broker , and about $135,000 to two other men , both previously identified as partners in the Farragut Gardens project . The questioning centered on how Mr. Traub had been able to pay off all but $20,000 of the , large debt and all but between $19,500 and $22,000 of the - small one . He said he had no other source of income , beyond4office fees ? " but I did salvage some money from those mortgages I had guaranteed . " This reference was unexplained . Mr. Traub and his attorney , Arthur Sheinberg , resisted the committee 's attempts to get them to bring the books in this morning . Finally Senator Bush said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel you have cooperated with the committee . We will have to subpoena those books and we want them here by 10 A. M. " Morty Wolosoff of Kings Point , L. I. , told of the financing of the Alley Pond Park project in Bay side . The building costs came to $4,176,423 ? which Mr. Simon brought out was $477,000 less than the mortgage proceeds. , The Alley Pond building project had been operated through three corporations capitalized at $1,000 each . Mr. Wolosoff and his brother , Alvin B. , each owned half the aggregate . Subsequently , Mr. Wolosoff tes tified , he and his brother paid $1,200 to $2,000 for an appraisal ) on the basis of which they felt entitled to withdraw half a million dollars as dividends . Alfred Wohl of Roslyn , L. I. , told of the Kew Terrace project in Flushing . In this case , two corporations were ' formed with $3,000 capital stock each . The mortgage proceeds came to $434,932 over costs .                @ @ @ @ @
