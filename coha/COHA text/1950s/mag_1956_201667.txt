The overcrowded Crown Colony of Hong Kong is the scene of a quiet but intense battle for the loyalties of its 2,500,000 Chinese inhabitants . Each year the measure of the battle is in the num ber of flags that fly on Red China 's National Day on Oct. 1 and Nationalist China 's older " Double Tenth " * anniver sary on Oct. 10 . As the Double Tenth dawned last week , the white-starred banner of the Republic of China seemed to have peacefully triumphed over the five-starred Red flag . Then an impetuous official ripped down two Nationalist flags in a strongly anti-Communist refugee project in Kowloon , across the bay from Hong Kong island . Riots , fear , death suddenly erupted across the peninsula . <P> It was started by enraged refugees , who stormed the government refugee offices where the Nationalist flags were removed . They smashed everything in sight and fired the building . Then , clotting into crowds and then into mobs , they fanned out to other parts of the colony . Club-swinging police dispersed some , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stones and water fell down from rooftops onto the heads of police reinforcements . Their night sticks and tear gas could not still the rioters . <P> Tomb of Asphalt . Through the night thousands of Chinese ranged the streets , looting and burning shops , factories and schools considered to have pro-Communist affiliations . Then , though it had begun as an anti-Communist eruption , the violence gradually changed complexion . The crowds began singling out foreigners . Europeans were dragged from their cars , beaten mercilessly while their cars were burned . By the morning of the second day , blood lust was running high . Along Kowloon 's broad Nathan Road some rioters overturned and fired a taxi bearing Swiss Vice Consul Fritz Ernst and his wife . The escaping driver fell into the arms of the mob , who doused him with gasoline and cremated him on a bed of bubbling asphalt . The Ernsts escaped , but Mrs. Ernst died of burns 48 hours later . <P> By the afternoon of the second day , as spotter planes wheeled overhead and tear-and vomit-gas bombs popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at long last ordered British troops into the troubled areas , soon swept the rioters off the streets . In the debris stretcher-bearers found a shoe containing a human foot . There also were 47 dead , almost all of them rioters destroyed by the terror they had fed . Nearly a hundred stores and buildings had been sacked and burned , and a pall of the smoke of burning loot hovered over Kowloon . Governor David ordered the first curfew in Hong Kong 's history . Military forces and police moved in to mop up a fiercely resisting core of rioters , arrested 3,000 Chinese suspected of provoking or leading rioters.
