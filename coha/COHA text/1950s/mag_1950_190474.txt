But the board thoughtfully gave everyone plenty of time to stock up . Not until Sept. 18 will the ban go down on easy credit of " nothing down , three years to pay , " which some retailers are offering . <P> The new rules : <P> For new &; used automobiles , a minimum down payment of one-third and maximum of 21 months to pay the balance . <P> For other consumer durables ( washing machines , refrigerators , radio &; TV sets , etc. ) , 15% down , 18 months to pay . <P> For household furniture , 10% down , 18 months to pay . <P> For materials to repair or remodel homes , 10% down and 30 months to pay . <P> While the curbs of the new Regulation W are slightly tighter than the credit controls which expired in June 1949 , they are much looser than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge accounts , and purchases under $100 are exempted from down-payment restrictions ( but subject to the payoff regulations ) . <P> Among the hardest hit will probably be used-car dealers , already feeling a slump in sales . Warned the Reserve Board : the regulation will be tightened " if conditions warrant . "
