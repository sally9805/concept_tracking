txt Paul G. Hoffman appealed last night for a more liberal and realistic tariff and trade policy to help the United States compete with the new Soviet economic offensive . The former Economic Cooperation Administrator urged Congress to adopt President Eisenhower 's proposal for United States membership in the Organization for Trade Cooperation ( 0 . T. C. ) . He asserted that an " effective and enlightened " foreign economic policy was essential to this country 's political survival . Mr. Hoffman is a close friend and adviser of President Eisenhower and is chairman of the Studebaker-Packard Corporation . He was a founder of the Committee on Economic Development , a business men 's planning group . Last night he received the second annual Cordell Hull Award ? an illuminated scroll ? from the Committee on Fdreign Trade Education at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . He then spoke on " United States Survival and the Russian Economic Offensive . " " Despite the startling repudiation of Stalin by Russia 's new leaders , the basic goal of the Kremlin is unchanged , " said Mr. Hoffman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great emphasis on periphery military action and threats of military action to make progress Javits of New York presented ! the award to Mr. Hoffman . The citation said Mr. Hoffman as Economic Cooperation Administrator had " succeeded brilliantly in reviving international commerce and industry , and , as a consequence , in stiffening warravaged Europe to meet the threat of communism . " It also said he had alerted many American business men to " the economic and political danger to which the nation is exposed by retention of out-of-date HOFFMAN APPEALS FOR EASIER TARIFF // toward that goal , the new leaders put their stress upon trade offers and offers of economic aid . " He warned that the economic contest could be lost by the United States unless the country as a whole awakened to all its implications . One of these implications , he said , is that the Russians are using trade " to win friends and influence people . " " Communist trade boss Anastas I. Mikoyan 's trip last month through Southeast Asia shows the design , " added Mr. Hoffman . Another implication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade " to create dissension among the free nations and particularly to build up the resentment of all nations against the United States . " He said effective Communist propaganda campaigns were made in countries where the United States had made " unpopular ' - ' trade moves . He cited Denmark after the United States had barred her cheese and Great Britain after Washington had raised the duty on British bicycles . " What the Communists will do to us in Japan if we bar Japanese textile products is something I do n't like to think about , " he said . Mr. Hoffman criticized " high protectionists " for the " vicious " attack he said they were making against President Eisenhower 's proposal that Congress pass the 0 . T. C. bill now before it . The bill would authorize this Government to join 0 . T. C. , which is to be set up by thirtyfive nations to administer the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . GATT was established after World War II by the United States and other nations to stabilize or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership in 0 . T. C. is a simple , commonsense plan to perfect the operation of GATT , " said Mr. Hoffman . " By means of 0 . T. C. there will be a forum in which most of the free nations will be able to negotiate a continuing expansion of international trade . It will give us a quick and effective means to see that the other nations hew to the line on their trade agreements with us . " Failure to authorize membership in 0 . T. C. wilTconfuse and depress the international trade situation and seriously compromise United States world leadership . " Mr. Hoffman criticized " selfseeking lobbies , well-financed and fast talking , " which he said exerted a major influence on Congress and the public in favor of high tariffs . He said the " high tariff people " had made " wild charges " that 0 . T. C. threatened the constitutional prerogatives of Congress in setting tariff policy . " Charges like these are plain nonsense , " he asserted . " 0 . T. C. will not in any sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He said that GATT had proved of great value to this country by increasing its export trade , and added : " Without expanding world trade we face disaster . We can not close ourselves off from the rest of the world except at very great risk to ourselves . We need goods from the outside world if we are to have a prosperous and expanding economy here . " We are rapidly coming to the point where our economic survival and strength , like Great Britain 's , is dependent on world trade . We must face up to this reality and adjust our thinking and attitudes as the British did many years ago . " The nation must realize the tremendous importance of trade . It is part and parcel of our expanding prosperity and an allimportant factor to our political survival . " Mr. Hoffman asserted that any restriction this country put on imports acted as a curb on exports . " Other free nations , if they are to have dollars to buy our goods , must have a chance to earn these dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save jobs in one industry by raising the tariff on competitive imports , we will do so only at the expense of jobs in some other industry . " For example , our textile industries are understandably concerned about the fact that during the first three quarters of 1955 the Japanese sold us ' $19 , - 000,000 worth of finished cotton goods . But we should n't forget that in that same period they bought from us $95,000,000 worth of raw cotton . " The award to Mr. Hoffman was made for " leadership in building United States foreign economic policy . " It was given in honor of the late Secretary of State Cordell Hull , whose program of reciprocal trade agreements under President Franklin D. Roosevelt set the pace for liberalization of this country 's foreign economic policy . Attorney General Jacob K. protectionist sentiment .
