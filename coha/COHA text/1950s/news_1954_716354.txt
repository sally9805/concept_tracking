txt The Federal Reserve Board has just taken a fresh step to implement its stated policy of maintaining a condition of " active ease " in the money market . It has announced a general reduction in the percentages of reserves that member banks of the system must maintain against their demand and time deposits . The schedule , which will go into effect gradually , calls for these changes in requirements against demand . deposits : New York and Chicago banks from 22 per cent to 20 per cent ; reserve city banks ( banks in most other large cities ) 19 per cent to 18 per cent , and country banks ( non-city member banks ) from 13 per cent to 12 per cent . In the case of time deposits the proposed reduction , from 6 per cent to 5 per cent , is uniform for all banks . It is estimated that the Reserve Board 's action will have the effect of releasing some $1,555 millions in cash reserve . This increase in reserve is sufficient , it is further estimated , to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as the economy enters the season of rising credit needs . " Among the demands facing the money market in the second half of the year will be Treasury borrowing amounting to about $10 billions . In addition , this is the time of year when private concerns and individuals also step up their borrowing to finance the marketing of crops and to build up inventories in preparation for the fall and holiday trade . There are two questions that the inquiring reader might be inclined to ask about this latest move on the part of the Reserve Board . One of these is : Since the same result ( increasing bank reserves ) could be achieved by the use of " open market operations " ( the purchase by the Reserve of Government securities ) why did it elect the method it used ? The other is : Why the differential of 1 per cent between the reduction in required reserves for New York and Chicago banks as against the other banks ? The Reserve Board , of course , does n't volunteer an explanation , except in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions . There are certain " negative " reasons , however , that suggest themselves in answer to the first question . One is that , with Reserve holdings of " Governments " already of a general magnitude of $25 billions , the Reserve might wish to avoid adding unnecessarily to its ' portfolio . As for the narrowing of the spread between the Chicago-New York bank requirements and that of other member banks , this , one suspects , is evidence of a facing up to the fact that great changes have occurred in the nation 's banking structure over the years . The New York and Chicago banks , arbitrarily classified as " central reserve city banks " in the Reserve Act , have always been compelled to maintain higher reserves than banks in other cities on the theory that they were the repositories of the bulk of the surplus funds of out-of-town banks . It seems fair to assume that the present Reserve authorities , who narrowed this differential a year ago from four percentage points to three and have now reduced it to two , are giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination against the New York and Chicago banks . If that assumption is true , one can only say that it is greatly to their credit .
