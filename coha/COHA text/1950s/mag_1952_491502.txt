OPPER is the scarcest common mineral in America 's defense pile . Copper production is meeting less than half of the requirements of copper users . The copper shortage means no shell casings for Korea or no toasters for housewives . So scarce is copper that in August of 1951 President Truman allowed a strike of copper workers in the West to continue for only three days before he invoked the Taft-Hartley Law , subsequently obtaining an injunction forcing the miners back to work . The injunction was good for eighty days , expiring November twenty-fourth . Government mediators used the eighty days in trying to bring the companies and the union to agreement . Even that brief shutdown in copper production caused a complete reshuffling of defense-production schedules . Most American copper comes from Arizona , Utah and other Western states . But copper also is mined in the Middle West . In fact , the copper country of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is America 's oldest copper district .

It stretches along Lake Superior , northeast from the Porcupine Mountains in Ontonagon County out along the Keweenaw Peninsula . The economic as well as the geologic backbone of this region is copper . The signs of its past copper glory are everywhere . The streets of Houghton are paved with asphalt made with " poor rock " from the mines , the copper glinting in the sun . In the ancient tiles on the barroom floor of the Douglass House are worn copper pennies . The movie theater is named The Lode . The woods are full of abandoned mines , once great , now just piles of rock , rusting scrap iron and rotting timbers . The earth is honeycombed . One man says , " I can actually hear the rocks falling under my house when they have an air blast in the mine . It 's like an earthquake . I wake up in the middle of the night , the bed 's dancing across the room , plates knocked off the plate rail .

" Nearly any stenographer can tell you , " C &; H went up a quarter today , " meaning that the common stock of the Calumet &; Hecla Consolidated Copper Company , still the giant of the range , went up twenty-five cents on the New York Exchange to $8.75 . Once C. &; H. common sold for $1000 . During the depression it was given away with sets of dishes . This is the only place in the world where copper occurs in large quantities in its native state  --  its pure metallic state . This has been copper country since a time before the white man ever saw this land , even before the Chippewa Indians came here . Nobody knows who the earliest miners were , but wagonloads of their relics have been found in the woods  --  tools and weapons which archaeologists believe were made before Columbus ' time .

They may have been the Aztecs , they may have been the early men who came across the Bering Strait from Siberia , they may have been wanderers from the Far East . One of the biggest Michigan mines , the Mineaeta ? the name represents a spelling weakness of an original deed drawer  --  was developed from the ruins of a prehistoric mine . In a pit drifted over with silt and brush so that only a slight depression remained , an early prospector found first great quantities of stone hammer heads , then beneath them a large solid mass of copper resting on crude planks , and beneath all a vein of copper . America 's first mining boom occurred here more than 100 years ago . Miners left the copper country to go to the gold fields of California in 1849 . For fifty years the copper kings of Michigan set the price of copper around the world . In every war the region boomed . This Michigan copper was so pure that it could be cleaned and drawn into electric wire just as it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The Great Copper Scramble is Under Way B UT early in this century , as the mines went deeper , the discovery of vast deposits , lower in grade , but cheaper to mine , in Montana , Arizona and Utah cost the copper country its leadership . A Michigan hard-rock miner says contemptuously , " Out there they do n't mine copper , they farm it . Blast it out of the side of a mountain , scoop it up . " The Michigan copper country declined in the ' 20 's and hit bottom in the depression , with one company mining copper where hundreds had before , with 92 per cent of the people of Keweenaw County on relief . People left the copper country by trainloads . " We had a fire in Houghton every night , " one man recalls ; " somebody burning down his house to get the insurance money to leave . " The population of Houghton County was 88,000 in 1910 ; by 1940 it had dropped to 47,000 .

So great is the United States ' need that the Government is lending Marshall Plan money for development of copper mines in the center of Africa , repayment to be made in metal . It is allowing a price of twenty-seven and a half cents per pound for Chilean copper sold in this country while restricting American mines to a price of twenty-four and a half cents . Some experts fear America may become dependent on foreign copper . And America 's need is constantly increasing . The scramble is on . Michigan copper companies have applied for Government loans to explore new ore bodies and reopen mines earlier abandoned . Are the Michigan mines exhausted ? Is the copper gone ? What , can new methods of prospecting and mining accomplish ? What part can the Michigan copper country play in the national copper scramble ? " There 's a lot of copper around here , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a semicircle . He was James Fisher , historian of the copper country and professor emeritus at the Michigan College of Mining and Technology , at Houghton , one of the oldest and best mining schools in America . He sat , one short leg drawn up , on a davenport in the faculty lounge . " Copper THE TREASURE PITS OF UPPER MICHIGAN ( Continued from Page 37 ) everywhere . But there 's no sense min-mg a dollar 's worth of copper if it costs you $1.25 to mine it . " When World War II began , the price of copper was frozen at twelve cents a pound , but Government premiums paid to marginal producers raised this to seventeen and a half cents , and at the end of the war in some cases companies were getting as much as twenty-four cents . When the war ended , the Government withdrew its price support , ? and three of the four companies that had operated during the war shut down . Only Calumet &; Hecla is still operating its mines . " Our mines are deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is down 9600 feet . There 's still lots of copper in the Quincy . But because of the shattering and widening of the lode at that depth and the decrease in copper per ton of rock , at today 's price they ca n't break even , And the same thing 's true of most of the properties around here . " What of the future ? He smiled . " A hundred years ago when the prospectors arrived they walked up the crick beds and along the lake shores , examining outcrops . It did n't take ' em long  --  less than half of one per cent of our copper outcrops . Then they learned the copper amygdaloids here are in a fairly soft , permeable rock . Being soft , they were easily eroded by the glaciers , and the result was a gap in the hills . So the old-time prospectors went around looking for those gaps in the hills Then they dug shallow trenches . Next they developed test pitting  --  digging deep holes like wells . Next came diamond drilling . Diamond drilling is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very satisfactory way of prospecting for copper-And finally geophysical prospecting . It 's an aid in delineating the area that might repay further exploration , but that 's all . Well , with all those methods , less than ten per cent of the possible copper-bearing area here has ever been explored . In my opinion , that 's where the future of this region lies  --  in the unexplored areas . The trouble is , exploration is expensive . What we need is a new technology for cheap prospecting . There 's just as much chance of finding good-paying lodes as there was in the past , if we develop new methods of locating them . " The copper kings and the copper miners inhabit a cluster of towns fifteen miles north of Houghton . Here , along the shores of Torch Lake , stretches a heavy industrial area where copper is refined  --  two miles of red stamp mills and smelters and reclamation plants , black girders , powerhouses , railroad cars , smokestacks , rough-timbered trestles , cranes , coal piles , grimy houses , dredges spewing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and it all ' belongs to Calumet and Hecla . The Calumet &; Hecla Consolidated Copper Company has mined more copper , paid more dividends , operated more mines , and employed more men than any other company in this region . Its history goes back to 1865 . Until 1920 it was the richest metals mine in the world . James MacNaughton ran C. &; H. from 1901 to 1941 . Many people say he also ran the copper country . A C. &; H. executive told me , " In the late 1930 's MacNaughton committed the company to a policy of going out of business . He was getting old and he was going to die and he figured the company might as well die too . Luckily , after he retired , some new fellows came along that figured , ' if you ca n't mine copper , let 's try something else . ' They got rid of all the old fogies , brought in new blood , started all over . " Albert E. Petermann , a vice-president and general counsel of C. &H.,; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expensive to operate , so we started in 1941 to get away from complete reliance on mining copper . We bought the Wolverine Tube Company , in Detroit . After the war we expanded with a new tube mill at Decatur , Alabama . Then we put ourselves in the secondary-copper business  --  refining scrap . Then we went into the chemical business , started making insecticides and fungicides with a copper base . We 've set up a big research department to develop new products and brought in a man from New York to run it . " This diversification has kept the company going  --  and going at a profit , except in 1999 ? during the past ten years . Now C. &; H. is again hunting copper just as it did seventy-five years ago . In 1990 it was operating only one mine shaft . Today it operates seven . And it is expanding its mining . Petermann , a tail , rangy , pleasant man of forty-five , told me , " We 're producing every pound we can . And we 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application pending for a Government loan of $18,500,000 to unwater the Conglomerate and the Osceola . " The Conglomerate was the richest lode ever found in the copper country . Under MacNaughton it was abandoned and allowed to fill with water-9,000,000,000 gallons of water , which it would take over three years to pump out . It contains copper-bearing rock richer than most being mined in Michigan today . The loans are tied to applications for procurement contracts under which the Government will buy the copper thus produced . Petermann went on , " We 're going ahead on our own to explore an ore deposit down in Ontonagon County . And a few weeks ago we got Government approval of a loan to undertake another hig exploration program  --  we 're going to spend $568,000 running drifts north and south off the Iroquois lode and . the Kearsarge lode in the hope of ( Continued on Puge 73 ) ( Continued front Page 71 ) running into another ore shoot , and we 're going to do a lot of surface trenching in various places around here . The Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface trenching , he said , would be done with heavy bulldozers and draglines . Last year C. &; H. experimented with this method , which never before had been used in the copper country . Conceivably it could be the new prospecting method that Professor Fisher spoke of . The problem of the Michigan copper mines , Petermann said , is one of price economics . Years ago the mines made money when the price of copper was high , lost money when it dropped , and often had to close if it stayed low too long . The result was a boom-and-bust economy . Today the Government has imposed a ceiling of twenty-four and a half cents on the price . Petermann thinks the Government ought to re ? move the ceiling and allow the price to rise during the present shortage . This would enable the companies to make a greater profit , which would enable them to undertake more exploration . Failing that , he would like to see the Government subsidize the marginal producers . He has criticized the Government for allowing Chilean copper to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper  --  a subsidy , in effect , to Chilean copper . Petermann told me , " I went down to Washington a while back on this . We took the position that if we could look forward to a normal peacetime economy , we did n't have any more right to a subsidy than a man who manufactures bird cages . But if the country needed copper , somebody 'd have to pay for the cost of getting it out . And if the people of the United States were the ones who 'd benefit by having it , they were the ones that ought to pay for it . We used to say that copper mining was feast or famine . The trouble is today that Government controls let you have the famines , but not the feasts . " Outside on the green lawn workmen were erecting a new company sign . Across the street children played beside a vacant lot between two houses , and the lot was fenced because in its center was an abandoned mine shaft . Out at the edge of town on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills , mine machinery hummed on the surface , pulling the ore skips up and down the inclined shafts while a mile underground men dug copper . What of the future ? Petermann said earnestly , " Someday the low-grade material will be all that 's left anywhere in the United States . Then we 'll be sitting pretty . And it 's possible that there are some richer things out there " ? and he gestured toward the outdoors " than have ever been found . We think we 'll go plugging along and plugging along , and even if the mines go out , we 'll keep our other activities going here , maybe even build ' em up , and all the time keep on exploring , and then all of a sudden we 'll find ourselves back in business . Someday this is going to be the mining area of the country again . " The recent strike of the Western copper miners did not affect the Michigan mines . The Western miners belang mainly to the Mine , Mill &; Smelter Workers Union . The Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the CIO expelled the M. M. &; S. W. for communist leanings . Then they joined the United Steelworkers of America . Gene Saari , a wiry blond Finn who or ganized the miners here in 1939 for the M. M. &; S. W. , then switched them to the United Steelworkers , told me there had n't been a major strike in years . In fact , in 1949 the workmen at C. &; H. had accepted a fifteen-cent wage cut . This cut was restored last May . Oddly , this is the same sum that the Western miners recently settled for  --  plus four and a half cents fringe benefits  --  with Kennecott . One serious labor-management dispute , though it was n't a strike , did occur here fight after the war . When the Government withdrew its wartime price premiums , the Copper Range Company told Saari it would have to close its mine unless the union relinquished certain fringe benefits . Saari urged the men to do so . They refused  --  they thought the company was bluffing . The company closed the mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thrown out of work , and the older ones are still walking the streets . I 'd heard that communists had influenced the men 's decision . " Hell , no , " Saari said . " They do n't know the difference between communism and rheumatism . " * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * In the past , many people in the copper country have blamed the decline of mining here partly on poor labor-management relations . They say the labor movement here is built around a hard core of radicalism . dating back to the terrible strike of 1913 , which was railed by a onetime affiliate of the revolutionary Industrial Workers of the World . This affiliate was the Western Federation of Miners . The Mine , Mill and Smelter Workers Union is a descendant of the old Western Federation . Saari himself has been called a radical , ' but he does n't talk like one . In fact , many of his views coincide with the views of company officials I talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his living room where he has his office , Saari said , " We in America are consuming more copper than we are producing . I 've got all the figures . I love these people in the Michigan copper district . But I 'm concerned about the basic problem . It 's a problem greater than trade-unions and companies . Every pound of copper in the United States must be extracted . And if we do n't put in a subsidy for our marginal mines and stop paying a subsidy to Chilean mines , we 're going to become dependent on chile and Rhodesia for our copper . In a few years Kennecott and Anaconda and Phelps Dodge wo n't have any copper left out West to extract . But Calumet &; Hecla will have copper for eighty years  --  if the Government helps them . If it does n't , we 'll lose it for the economy of our nation and the prosperity of our people . With subsidies , the companies will know that for five or ten years they 'll get a certain price for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead with long-range exploration and underground development . And labor will know what their wages will be and whether they 'll still have jobs two or three years from now . But if they depend on the vagaries of the Open market , nobody knows where they are . " Later in Bahor 's Tavern , a big square room , I found Saari and four copper miners drinking beer at a round table , and he said to them , " Tell him about working conditions . " " It 's boiling hot , " said a thin young man with a sad , angular face , " because the mines are so deep . And there 's no drinking water down there . " . " No toilets , either , " said a man with slicked-down hair . " Just a powder box the size of a beer case . " " The worst thing is the rock bursts , " said the young man . " Air blasts . They 're caused by the pressure on the rocks at great depths . The rock just explodes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from eleven to sixteen dollars a day . This is about what lumberjacks get . They say it is less than Michigan iron miners get , less than coal miners or the Western copper miners who struck . The young man said , " I 've made as good as ninety a week , but to do it I did n't stop to open my dinner pail all day long . " He told me how much it cost him to live . " I 've got nothing . I 'm in debt , in fact . I did n't work for several months because I got hurt in the mine . We 're not living . My kids want this , my kids want that . What can I promise ' em ? " His face had gone white , he was leaning forward . " There 's nobody here loves his job . But I was born and raised here . Besides , where am I to go ? " He relapsed suddenly into his chair . The man with the slicked-down hair said , " He 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls the social life , the religious life , the education , everything . Business people are called into meetings by the company and told what to do . You own your house , but the company owns the ground it stands on and they can put you out at any time . And you ca n't sell your house to anybody without the permission and approval of the company . " Businessmen also criticize the copper companies . They complain that the companies care only for dividends , not for the region or its people ; that they are absentee-owned ? " they ca n't even sell an old board without clearing it with Boston " ? that they have controlled local politics ; that , by clinging tightly to their vast land holdings , they have kept out new industries which they feared would raise wages , and have retarded the growth of the resort business . The companies ' power , which certainly has been tremendous in the east , rests , at bottom , on the land they own . C. &; H. alone owns about 250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may sell some . It is holding its industrial sites , he says , not to keep out new industry , but for its own expansion . It has sold most of its houses , which it had rented for a dollar a month a room , though it does still own the ground the houses stand on . He felt that people were still criticizing C. &; H. for things it did thirty years ago and would n't think of doing now . He said , " You see , this company used to sort of try to run things around here . It was a historical necessity . The whole area was a wilderness to start with , and the company had to build a town ? houses , schools , churches and 74 THE SATURDAY EVENING l'OS1 ' February 16 , 1952 everything else  --  water , lights , fire department , police department . We used to control local politics . We do n't any more . We 're getting away from the whole idea of paternalism . We think it 's a had thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners are getting scarce , as are all miners . Many young men refuse to go underground , where the work is hard and dirty and dangerous . They prefer safer , cleaner , better-paid jobs in city factories . But an older man who had been sitting all along without saying anything much , smiling a little , picking at the label on his beer bottle , now began to speak slowly . " You asked why do we do this kind of work if we do n't like it . Well , I 'll tell you why . You can work a while and sit down awhile . You do n't punch a clock . If you do n't feel well , you do n't produce much . You 're your own boss in a way . You 're all by yourself all day . I started in the mine in 1922 . Two dollars and seventy cents a day . I worked one year , and I decided to go to the city to improve my status . So I went to Detroit , and an auto company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they call a reamer on connecting rods . Standing up all day . That assembly line moving . Wearisome toil . My quitting time was four o'clock . One day I shut down two minutes before four . The foreman came running over . ' What 's the trouble ? ' he said . " Trouble ? No trouble , quitting time . " He looked at his watch . ' Well , I do n't mind half a minute , but two minutes is too much . ' Well , it was September , and I started thinking of hunting and fishing up here , and I thought , Detroit , the hell with you and your five dollars a day . I quit and came back in the mine . " As we have seen , C. &; H. for years produced billions of pounds of copper ; then MacNaughton in the 1930 's decided it , was dying ; then new men in 1941 revived it by going into new fields ; and now , after ten years of diversification , it is exploring new areas , reopening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more into the copper-mining business . And this pattern is , in little , the story of the copper country as a whole . When copper mining went flat in the terrible 1930 's , people looked elsewhere for salvation . But farming did n't expand . Logging could n't take up the slack . Tourism was n't yet a major industry . And attempts to bring in new industry failed . Today , once more , people are looking to copper . A storekeeper told me , " C. &; H. has 2400 employees , . and their buying power 's what 's keeping me going . " The county agricultural agent said that if another mine or two would open up , it 'd help the bottled-milk business ? " and dairying 's the backbone of our farming here . " And down in Ontonagon , where everybody is talking about the possible reopening of the White Pine Mine , a friend of mine , Vern Foster , who runs a sawmill , said , " They 'll have to build a town out at the White Pine higger'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twenty million feet of lumber . We can saw lumber faster'n they can nail it up . " The reopening of the White Pine was by all odds the biggest thing in the wind when I was up in the copper country . One man told me , grinning , " I understand that nobody in Ontonagon 's done any work all summer  --  everybody sitting around waiting for the White Pine to open . " When the White Pine closed in 1920 , the process of extracting copper from the low-grade ores found there was little understood . In the late ' 30 's Copper Range , second in size and importance to C. &; H. , began exploring the White Pine ore body . Since the war it has set up a pilot mill and laboratory to test new technology and has mined enough ore for research . It feels now that it is ready to go ahead . It has reported it could produce 75,000,000 pounds of copper a year from the White Pine and applied for Government help . Recently its application for a loan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $57,000,000 , the biggest RFC loan since the war . Government officials have called the White Pine ore body the largest undeveloped but discovered copper reserve in America . Driving over a gravel road along Lake Superior through cutover country to the White Pine location , Lawrence Walsh , an Ontonagon lawyer , told me , " The large sawmill closed here two years ago , let about 600 people out of work . So the reopening of the White Pine would mean a lot to us . You take a county of 10,000 people and add a new population of 6000 ? that 's what they 'd need  --  and you can see . " Up ahead lay the Porcupine Mountains , blue in the distance . Presently it started raining . We turned onto a narrower road through the dark woods , past black beaver ponds in the meadows , red-foaming streams in the deep-gashed ravines , and stopped at the old White Pine location to talk to Capt . Walter Smith and his son . A mining captain is an underground boss and is always addressed by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a round , domed head and a beaked nose . He had been sent here to take charge of underground exploration in 1946 . He has been on the company payroll since 1915 , and his Polish-immigrant father was a miner . What were the prospects of the White Pine ? " The plans are big , " he said , " but nobody knows for sure when they 're coming out with them . " His son , a husky young miner , said , " That old stock is n't going up for nothing . " What had happened to the people around here when the mines closed down ? " Some are logging , some retired . Some went to the cities and some to the iron country . " Would n't it be hard to find enough men to work the White Pine ? " Far as I know , " said Captain Smith , " there 's a lot of men just waiting for a chance to come back here and mine copper . " On the way back to Ontonagon , we passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows gone , the old schoolhouse with the windows boarded up , a town hall the size of a tool shed , a half-dozen log shacks , now deserted , except for a few down-and-out squatters . Walsh said , as though talking to himself , " My father was a miner . He worked all over , mining . My earliest recollections were of living in a town where all the windows are boarded up in the mining buildings . Then one morning you wake up and hear the mine whistle blow again , and everything is fine . Then the price of copper drops or the war ends , and they blow the whistle for the last time . And the company offices are boarded up again , and pretty soon the miners pack up their furniture and move away , and finally somebody tears down the houses or they burn down . In a normal lifetime here you expect that to happen about three times . My hope is that things will open up again now . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
