In defiance of gravity , most successful TV shows have a way of going in two directions at once-up and down . They push themselves up in popularity by dishing out the kind of entertainment the customers have been led to expect , and then dig themselves into a rut by shoveling out scheduled helpings of the predictable . Sooner or later the customers get the idea , and suddenly a very popular TV show starts going in one direction only . " What we need , " say the TV brass-hats , " is something different-but not too different . " Last week they offered viewers something tried , something true , something different and even something new . <P> Love &; History . The public has been fed situation comedy until it is almost fed up ( TIME , June 27 ) , but viewers still love I Love Lucy . How long the love affair will continue depends on how much comic inventiveness Desi and Lucy can put into their formula of a young couple getting in and out of slapstick situations with a well-shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the re-run of an old Lucy was neither comic nor inventive .

" Dr. Bunche was a credit to the U.N. , to the U.S. and to his race . <P> Imagination &; Morals . Winding up a successful run on Broadway , 3 for Tonight breezed onto Front Row Center ( Wed . 10 p.m . E.D.T. , CBS-TV ) like a breath of spring . On an empty stage with no sets and few props , Narrator Hiram Sherman asked his viewers to contribute imagination to the show . He held up a pencil and said it was a sprig of lilac . Just then a girl walked by . " You 're late , " said , Sherman . She hung her head . " Here , " he said , and handed her the pencil . Immediately the girl was aglow . " Oh !
