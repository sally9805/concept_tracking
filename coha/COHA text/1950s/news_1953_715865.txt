txt " The Man Who Would n't Talk " has finally talked . He is George Dupre , a Canadian World War II intelligence agent whose cloakand-dagger experiences in France are recounted in a book by that name published Nov. 1 by Random House . It has been reprinted in a condensed version in the November Reader 's . Digest . What he had to say has reddened the faces of Quentin Reynolds , the author of the book , and of the editors of Random House and The Reader 's Digest . For it now develops that the hero of the book never was in France . " It looks like the greatest hoax ever perpetrated , " Mr. Reynolds said yesterday . And Bennett . Cerf , president of Random House , which has a- third printing of the book ordered , remarked : " It seems that the book should have been called ' The Man Who Talked Too Much . " What Mr. DuPre , a Calgary , ' Alberta , business man , did after his return from the war is almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. ? DuPre was described as in a state of collapse and under a doctor 's care after , , he had been ' trapped Friday by a Calgary reporter , himself a former intelligence agent , into admitting that the tublished story was a fabrication When Mr. DuPre returned from war service , he discussed his experience with his neighbors . Word got around and he was invited to talk before a church meeting in his home town . Next came an invitation to address a service club . Demands from clubs and business groups outside his home town followed . With . each telling , his war experiences grew and in the next six years he spoke ' to one group after another across the breadth of Canada . Asked by a Calgary reporter why he enlarged on his war service , he replied : " For no special reason . But ft ( the storn grew beyond my ability to control it . " Finally , last June , Mr. DuPre spoke before a group of Toronto business men , one of whom informed The Reader 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Canada waiting to be written . Mr. DuPre was invited to New York and so impressed The Reader 's Digest editors with his sincerity , modesty and integrity that Mr. Reynolds was assigned to write a book about his experiences . The former intelligence agent went to Mr. Reynolds ' home at Bedford Village , N. Y. , for a week 's stay . After Mr. Reynolds had completed his manuscript , he visited Mr. DuPre in Calgary to fill in a few details , get Mr. DuPre 's approval of the book and conduct a check on Mr. DuPre . Mr. Reynolds came away satisfied with . the authenticity of Mr. DuPre 's experiences after having talked with prominent members of the community and after authorities of the Royal Canadian Air Force had spoken highly of Mr. DuPre 's service with its intelligence branch . One of the persons who talked with Mr. Reynolds was Nathan Tanner , who has just retired as Alberta 's Minister of Mines . Told of the hoax , he said : " I am shocked because Mr. DuPre is an outstanding citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew all along that her husband was not telling the truth and that she had warned him continually that his story might be exposed . " He was trying to be a hero to me , " she said , " but he did n't need to . I was quite satisfied with him the way he was . " Wrong Answers to Right Man The first clue to the duplicity came from a fellow veteran of Mr. DuPre , who " tipped off " The Calgary Herald . The tipster had a photograph snowing himself and Mr. DuPre together in Victoria , B. C. , in 1942 when Mr. DuPre was supposed to have been working with the French underground . The newspaper assigned Douglas Collin% a reporter who had been captured at Dunkerque and escaped , to investigate . " I was myself connected with Intelligence , " the reporter told Mr. DuPre . " Which section were you with , A , B. or C ? " Mr. DuPre replied he was in B , whereupon the reporter inquired : " Then you must have known dear old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time ? " " Yes , indeed , I knew him very well , " Mr. DuPre replied . The Intelligence section was divided into two sections known as F and R-F . Colonel Kitchingham was an imaginary person . And the rest was easy for the reporter . Mr. DuPre , it developed , enlisted in the R. C. A. F. in May , 1942 , wa sent to England for seventeen days of training early in 1943 and was then assigned to a post on the West Coast of Canada . In April , 1945 , he was assigned to Yorkshire , England , and was there for six months before his return to Canada and his discharge . Mr. DuPre is the Calgary manager of ** Chemicals , Ltd. , and- is described as a selfeffacingi - modest and deeply religious person . The father of two small sons , he is active in the Boy Scouts of Canada . DeWitt Wallace , editor of The ' Reader 's Digest , said that Mr. DuPre was not interested in any financial arrangements and that ' when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the royalties he replied that he would turn the money over to the Boy Scouts . Recalling Mr. DuPre 's visit to New York last summer , Mr. Wallace said : " Everyone commented upon how much sincerity and strength of character he had . " Despite the absence of any agreement to do so , Mr. Wallace said The Reader 's Digest had mailed a check to Mr. DuPre for the use of the condensed version . He said an explanation of the hoax would be made in the January issue . 444 The first printing of the book , 7,500 copies , was sold out the first day and a second printing of 2 500 copies is nearly gone , Random House reported . A third printing , also of 2,500 copies , had been ordered . Mr. Cerf said he was still investigating the whole matter . " But it does n't look good right now , " he added . " And we got such wonderful reviews ! " After hearing from the Calgary police , Mr. Reynolds concluded that he had been the victim of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have bet my life on this man , " the writer said . " He did n't ask for any money and was surprised when he was told he would share in the proceeds of the book 's sale . " In " The Man Who Would n't Talk " Mr. DuPre is said to have posed as a mental defective in gathering information for the Allies in France and to have been so shattered by his experience that he had to undergo psychiatric treatment at the end of the war . A postscript to The Reader 's Digest condensation says : " Few people know how DuPre spent the war , and they are not likely to learn of it from him . He is a quiet man , as modest as he is courageous . " The foreword says , with an enthusiatm that now must read like irony : " George DuPre 's extraordinary story both challenges and renews one 's faith in human nature . As sheer exciting reading it has few equals in all the undercover operations of the British Intelligence Service . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
