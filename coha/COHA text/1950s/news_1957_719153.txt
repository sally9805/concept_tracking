txt Secretary of State Dulles has predicted that in a few years the Western powers may be able to defend themselves ; with tactical nuclear weapons in the event of a nonnuclear attack by the Soviet Union . Only if the Soviet Union made an all-out nuclear attack would the Western powers have to reply in kind , according to Mr. Dulles . Mr. Dulles , in an article in the October issue of the quarterly Foreign Affairs , published today , thus indicated that the United States was shifting from the " massive retaliation " strategy he announced in January . 1954 . At that time , Mr. Dunes said that the Eisenhower Administration had decided to place " more reliance on community deterrent power , and less dependence on local defensive power . " He emphasized then that an aggressor would be confronted with " a great capacity to retaliate , instantly , by means and at places of our own choosing.11 Wide Havoc Ruled Out In his Foreign Affairs article , however , the Secretary of State said that the United States had found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction and widespread harm to humanity . " He continued : " Recent tests point to . the possibility of possessing nuclear weapons the destructiveness and radiation effects of which can be confined substantially to predetermined targets . " In the future it may be possible to defend countries by nuclear weapons so mobile , or so placed , as to make military invasion with conventional forces a hazardous attempt . " As an example , Mr. Dulles wrote , invasion routes often could he " decisively dominated by nuclear artillery . " He added that , in contrast to the present decade , by the Nineteen Sixties the nations around " the SinoSoviet perimeter " could possess an effective defense against fullscale conventional attack . U. S. Responsibility Held Great He added that any aggressor would be confronted with the choice of defeat or the initiation of nuclear war . " Thus the tables may be turned , " he continued , " in the sense that instead of those who are nonaggressive having to rely upon all-out nuclear retaliatory power for their protection , would-be aggressors will be unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves weigh the consequences of . invoking nuclear war . " In discussing the implications of such a change in strategy , Mr. Dulles declared that " so long as collective security depends almost entirely upon the deterrent of retaliatory power , ' the United States would have to bear almost the entire responsibility . He emphasized , however , that " as nuclear weapons become more tactical In character and thus more adaptable to area defense , " allies of the United States who were " technically qualified " would want to " participate more directly in this defense and to have a greater assurance that this defensive power will in fact be used . " " Such factors are already leading to study of a so-called ' atomic weapons stockpile , ' which could be established by the United States in the European NATO area , and , as becomes appropriate , made available to NATO , " he declared . Mr. Dulles did not elaborate on the stock piling proposal . In the event of a general war , the United States could supply its Atlantic Treaty allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be required to do so in peacetime . Last summer , when the proposed strategy was being discussed , there were reports Congress adjourned last month . Sources close to Mr. Dunes , who is in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly , said tonight that the new strategy would be " superimposed " on the " massive retaliation " strategy , but would not replace it entirely . Mr. Dulles , who will make a policy speech tomorrow morning in the Assembly 's opening debate , was expected to emphasize the disarmament issue . In his article , Mr. Dulles said Soviet diplomacy and propaganda were striving to prevent developments under which an aggressor could succeed only if he started a nuclear war . For this reason , he wrote , Soviet leaders oppose " all such experimental testing of nuclear devices as is necessary to find ways to reduce fall-out and to reduce size . " He added that " they seem to prefer that nuclear weapons be only the ' horror ' type of weapons , " and that " they apparently calculate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such weapons . " Informed sources said tonight they believed Mr. Dulles ' article was addressed primarily tol Western European countries , which have been concerned lest the only way to counter a Soviet act of aggression be nuclear war by the United States . The current NATO doctrine is that the aliiance 's forces must be strong enough to hold an all-out aggressor in check until nuclear weapons can be brought to bear . Senator . John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , in an article entitled , " A Democrat Looks at Foreign Policy , " criticized a number of decisions by the Eisenhower Administration . He declared that " washing one 's hands of responsibility , like plans for ' sanitary war ' and ' clean bombs , ' induces an illusion of antisepsis and tidy order , but it is only an illusion . " However , he criticized also actions by the Truman Administration , such as " the ? unnecessarily forced pace of German rearmament. "                   @ @
