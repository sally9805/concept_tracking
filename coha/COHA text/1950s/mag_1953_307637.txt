In the course of spotlighting security risks in Government jobs , Republican Washington has begun to develop men who jump at shadows . Shadow-jumping caused the State Department to pocket-veto the nomination of Mildred McAfee Horton , distinguished educator and ex-WAVE commander , to the United Nations ' Economic &; Social Affairs Commission ( TIME , June 1 ) . Last week shadow-jumping accounted for another victim : Chicago Investment Banker David Lee Shillinglaw , in the running for an appointment to the U.N . ' s Economic &; Social Council . This time the jumpy one was a U.S. Senator , Illinois-Republican Everett Dirksen . <P> Shillinglaw , an old Republican hand who has contributed to and worked for the Illinois G.O.P. for 20 years , has a deep interest in foreign affairs , is president of Chicago 's International House . A former state commander of the American Legion , he worked hard and effectively in the Eisenhower campaign . After the election , he asked his friend Everett Dirksen to sponsor him for an appointment to UNESCO . Dirksen agreed , and things looked set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Secretary of State Donold Lourie . <P> Then Shillinglaw 's clearance got bogged down in federal security procedure . The FBI called Sponsor Dirksen 's attention to Shillinglaw 's membership in the Institute of Pacific Relations , which the Senate Internal Security ( McCarran ) Subcommittee had found to have been infiltrated by Communist sympathizers . Shillinglaw said that he had satisfied himself that the I.P.R. had purged itself of subversive elements . But Dirksen , fearful of objections in the Senate , especially by McCarran and Joe McCarthy , asked Shillinglaw to withdraw anyway . Replied Shillinglaw : No- " It 's a matter of honor . " <P> Last week Dirksen 's office made it clear to Dave Shillinglaw that , as far as Dirksen is concerned , Shillinglaw is no longer a candidate for the U.N . job .
