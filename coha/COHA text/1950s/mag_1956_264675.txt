BEYOND THE BLACK STUMP ( 316 pp. ) - Nevil Shufe-Morrow ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> Britons are still apt to regard both Americans and Australians as colonials without much culture . In his eigth novel , British Author Nevil Shute has set up a kind of midget contest between these two " uncultivated " cultures . The contest arises when a bunch of American oilmen arrive in Australia 's spinifex country ( so named for its tough desert grass ) . The Australians are astounded by the Americans ' ability to set up ice-cream plants in the desert , to work like madmen for oil in a country that probably lacks it and , anyway , needs water more . The Americans , in turn , are baffled by the Australians ' capacity for rum and their insistence on the right of man-state-given , if not God-given-not to work too hard . <P> Apart from watching Author Shute trying to decide who are the less cultured , the Yanks or the Aussies , the reader may have some fun with the locale : Laragh Station , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are graduate gunmen of the Irish Republican Army who are busy populating their underpopulated principality with a brood of half-caste children , some named sentimentally for great figures of the Irish Troubles . Overproof Queensland rum is their drink ; mutton is their food ; and once a year a priest arrives on the scene to christen the new children , and to tell the elders that they are living in mortal sin . Mrs. Regan has been " married " to the two brothers in succession . <P> <P> In these wide open spaces , Americans are a new species . Mollie Regan , red-haired and illegitimate daughter of one Regan , meets Stanton Laird , oil geologist from Oregon . His rival is David Cope , a " pommy " ( Australian slang for English immigrant ) who runs a neighboring station , a pint-size affair of about 300,000 acres . Mollie goes off to Oregon with the ice-cream addict , Stanton , but when she discovers that the U.S. frontier has been all softened up by milk shakes and civilization , she returns to the rum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Author Shute , himself a " pommy , " declared before he prepared to take his talents ( and his private gardener ) to Australia in 1951 : " It is a long time since a first-class novelist has worked in the southern hemisphere . " This book does nothing to alter that situation . Before his writing lifted him into rarefied financial levels , Shute was an aeronautical engineer who helped design and fly Britain 's dirigible R.100 on its transatlantic flight of 1930. * His fiction has some of the improbable , inflated , but often entertaining quality of the **25;11360;TOOLONG . <P> <P> * Shute 's novel , No Highway ( 1948 ) , gave an imaginative account of an airliner 's disintegration through metal fatigue , which seemed very nearly prophetic in the light of the British Comet crashes in 1954.
