Delegates to the seventh U.N . General Assembly gathered last week in New York and gaped like tourists at their spickly span new headquarters . Never have the technicians of peace been given a better workshop . The 18 acres along Manhattan 's East River were a brilliant enclave of cubes and domes encased in glass and white stone , stocked with marvelously efficient gadgets and thick rugs . The Assembly 's own $12 million hall , a low , sweeping building with vast high corridors and uncluttered lobbies , looked serene and orderly . The New York Times 's Anne O'Hare McCormick heard more than one onlooker murmur : " Let 's hope all of this will not go to waste . " <P> All week long Secretary of State Dean Acheson had wrestled over what to say to the new Assembly . A tough , frank speech might please the U.S. voters and help the Democratic ticket , a soft one might placate America 's nervous allies and please the Assembly . Acheson delayed his speech for a day , rewrote it six times . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little new . Fellow delegates hailed it with words like " moderation and sanity . " <P> As Acheson talked , Russia 's Andrei Vishinsky followed the English text closely and three times underscored Acheson 's remarks . The underscorings : " The aggressor in Korea now counts for victory upon those of faint heart who would grow weary of the struggle . . . We shall fight on as long as is necessary to stop the aggression . We shall stop fighting when an armistice on just terms has been achieved . . . The Communists have so far rejected reasonable terms for an armistice . " <P> Two days later Vishinsky got to his feet and , in a monotone , for 75 minutes accused the U.S. of " bluster , blackmail and pressure " in Korea , retold the " germ warfare " tale , and charged that U.S. " billionaires " are bent on more &; more bloodshed to swell their billions . Midway through , Acheson removed his earphones for a few minutes , and some delegates began leaving . <P> After hearing these profitless exchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of lively fights to come . The 13 anticolonial Arab-Asian powers , defeated in the last session , got together and succeeded in placing on the agenda a proposal to debate 1 ) France 's rule in Tunisia and Morocco , and 2 ) South Africa 's virulent racism . They won despite protests from France , Britain , Australia , South Africa and New Zealand that such debates constitute " meddling " in internal affairs . The U.S. haplessly reversed its stand of last year , opposed its European allies and joined the anti-colonials . Russia , seeing a fine chance to divide its enemies , was already on the anti-colonials ' side .
