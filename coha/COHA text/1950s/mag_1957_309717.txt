The U.S. oil industry was caught last week in a pinch that had the oilmen howling for relief . Instead of the usual 4%-5% annual increase in domestic oil demand , consumption has edged up only 1% , pushing surplus stocks of petroleum products to 723.9 million bbl. by the end of September , nearly 43 million bbl. more than during the same period last year . Oilmen everywhere cut back exploration for new wells , and prices slumped sharply . With more oil than it can sell , Ohio Oil Co. shaved its bids for new supplies of Wyoming heavy crude by 8 per bbl. and Indiana Standard cut its price to Arkansas producers by 10 per bbl . At consumer levels a rash of price wars from New Orleans to New Jersey cut service station prices as low as 14.9 per gal . before taxes . <P> To some oilmen , mainly the big importers , the growing glut is a result of domestic overproduction during the Suez crisis . They argue for drastic cutbacks in U.S. production . But in many oil states , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues , output has already hit rock bottom . In Texas , which supplies 42% of all U.S. oil , October output was limited to twelve days , lowest allowable since 1939 . Louisiana wells are producing at history 's lowest rate , while Oklahoma is so pressed that it went to court last week with a $500 million suit against Gulf Oil Corp. , charging that the company cut its purchases of Oklahoma crude to 80% of allowables without asking for necessary " exemptions " from its buying agreements . <P> To solve the problem , the U.S. Government stepped in last week with more of the same distasteful medicine it has been pressuring the industry to swallow for months . Instead of cutting domestic production , it will insist that major oil companies chop back their imports of cheaper foreign oil under a " voluntary " 10% reduction program ( TIME , Sept. 30 ) . Having already rejected appeals by three companies ( Tidewater , Indiana Standard Oil , Ohio Standard ) for sizable boosts in their import quotas . Navy Captain Matthew V. Carson Jr. , administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. and Sinclair Oil Co. , even though Sinclair argues that it will mean costly cutbacks in its ambitious plans to sell Venezuelan crude oil . <P> So far only Sinclair and Indiana Standard have publicly conceded that the ruling leaves the major companies little choice but to go along . Yet the importers know that if they refuse the voluntary cutbacks , they face mandatory controls by the Government , may even come up against legislation in Congress to reduce imports . Though only ten of the 22 curbed importers say that they can meet their quotas by January , their imports are slowly inching down , will average 849,300 bbl. daily by December , not too far from the Government 's goal of 755,700 bbl. daily for the year ending next June 30.
