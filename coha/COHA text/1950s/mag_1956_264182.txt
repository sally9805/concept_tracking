In crowded streets and candle-gleaming churches of Chicago and New York City , the Feast of St. John the Baptist was celebrated in high style last week . There were heaps of lechn asado ( roast pig ) and pasteles ( meat cakes wrapped in plantain leaves ) . Blindfolded children laughingly broke piatas , whacking away with sticks at the hanging earthenware pots that might contain candy or water ; music vibrated whole city blocks , and there were dozens of mambo , cha-cha and rumba contests . For San Juan is the patron saint of the island of Puerto Rico , and the Roman Catholic Church in the two cities was giving the Puerto Ricans their day . <P> The U.S. melting pot has never known anything like the Puerto Rican . For one thing , he is a U.S. citizen by birth , though he may never get to know more than a word or two of English . He steps out of a plane at Idlewild with but a seven-hour journey behind him , and he can be back among his wooden shacks again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $57.75 plane fare . In 1953 , for example , 289,000 Puerto Ricans left their island and 213,000 were back within the same year . <P> Unlike the immigrants from Europe , Puerto Ricans do not huddle together when they first put down roots . There are well over 600,000 Puerto Ricans in New York City ( there were fewer than 100,000 in 1945 ) , but there is not really a section that is to Puerto Ricans what Harlem is to Negroes . Almost every sector of the city has a bodega ( grocery ) or two , and perhaps a Spanish-language movie house . <P> They are almost entirely Roman Catholic but not quite the kind U.S. Catholics understand . Accustomed to receiving the sacraments only when a priest visits the village , sometimes baptizing their children themselves and often marrying without benefit of clergy , * Puerto Ricans have scandalized many a priest with their casual church ways . But gradually the church has found its way among the burgeoning Puerto Rican flock . The zesty mixture of fun and devotions last week in Manhattan and Chicago was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Time . In Chicago the fiesta was weeklong . Samuel Cardinal Stritch 's Committee for the Spanish Speaking in Chicago was set up to accentuate the positive among the city 's Puerto Ricans , block the growth of prejudice and discrimination against a group that numbers only 20,000 now but is expected to swell to 100,000 in ten years . <P> The week 's high jinks and hoopla were staged by busy , black-haired Father Leo T. Mahon , 30 , who has been working with Chicago 's Puerto Ricans for three years . Ten moppets showed up at city hall to present Mayor Richard J. Daley with a baby lamb named Felicitas , after the mayoress of San Juan , Felisa Rincn de Gautier . The lamb is not only the symbol of Puerto Rico but of the Chicago church 's potent and growing organization of Puerto Ricans , the Knights of St. John . Founded in 1954 , the Knights now number more than 1,000 families and sponsor social and recreational activities , run a hostel for newly arrived Puerto Ricans , a legal and medical-aid program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend money at low interest .
