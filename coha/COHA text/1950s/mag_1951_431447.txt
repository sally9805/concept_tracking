 | JOHNNY , " says the lady of the house , " here 's a dollar . Run buy me a can of fruit salad , and bring me the change . " Johnny knows where to go the grocery store around the corner . It does n't occur to him to ask where the grocer gets fruit salad . But if it should , the grocer , too , would know the answer ? from the wholesaler , who , of course , buys it ( at a discount ) from the packer . Obviously , it 's a simple matter to trace a fruit salad back to its source . Or is it ? Where did the packer get it ? Here the story becomes complicated . Suppose the canned salad contains just a handful of the commonest fruits : part of a pear , a few grapes , half a dozen sweet cherries , a piece of pineapple , and a few slices of peach . At home , Johnny 's mother may garnish these with a little fresh apple , grapefruit , or orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are grown today would take much travel . The apple is likely to have come from Virginia , New York , Washington State , or perhaps from the Midwest , near the Great Lakes : the cherries are probably from Oregon or Washington ; the grapefruit and orange from Florida or California ; the peach , pear , and grapes from the Pacific-coastal area ; and the pineapple all the way from Hawaii. * Most Fruits Are Newcomers But that is still only half the story . Peaches did n't always grow in California , nor apples in Washington . In fact , 500 years ago ? before the first white settlers came ? only the grape of all these common fruits had ever been seen or heard of in what is now the United States . The rest got here only after toilsome journeys lasting tens of centuries and starting in the farthest parts of the world .

Grapefruit ? Five centuries ago there were n't any . There was , growing in the East Indies , a big , tough fruit , the shaddock . Eventually ? sometime in the 1600 's ? it was to make a long voyage in a trading ship bound for the West Indies . There , by one of those strange tricks of Nature we call mutations , it would turn into a fruit like the one in our salad bowl ( page 354 ) . Pineapples started in the Western Hemisphere ; j Columbus found them growing in the West Indies . But even this fruit had moved halfway across the Pacific before it was sent to our fruit salad packer ( page 365 ) .

Why You Should Not Eat the Apple Core A man , going for a walk , plucks an apple from a tree , munches it as he walks , and then throws away the core . From the man 's point of view , eating the meat on the apple is the important part of this operation . To the tree , however , the important parts are that he walked , and that he threw away the core . In the struggle for survival , plants , like animals , have worked out tricks and devices to spread their seed . Or , putting it backward ( but more accurately ) , those plants on which no such device evolved were very likely to die out . Some developed seed pods which open explosively , scattering seeds for yards around . Others , like the dandelion , grew seeds on tiny parachutes which float in the wind ; still others evolved seeds which can survive long , wet trips in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different method of propagation evolved . Their seeds were covered with a layer of pulp or flesh which attracted animals and men because it was nourishing or had a pleasant flavor . Often , too , the skin covering the pulp was brightcolored and attractive . It is no accident that berries and cherries have been among the most widely distributed plants since prehistoric times . Their fruit was especially suited to birds , which could carry the seed farthest and fastest . At first , men , like the other animals , simply picked and ate the wild fruit , propagating it * See " Because It Rains on Hawaii , " by Frederick Simpich . Jr ..

Primitive man quickly learned , too , to pick out the seeds of the best plants ? those which bore most abundantly or produced food with the best flavor . This was scientific breeding in its earliest stages . He found that with most of the plants we now classify as vegetables , this system worked fairly well . These are the crops that we plant anew each year from seed , and which generally mature in a single season . They come fairly true from seed ; that is , the offspring of any plant usually resemble the parent . ' With fruits , however , this did n't work so well . One distinguishing feature of all the crops we commonly call fruits is that they grow on plants that live and produce for a number of years . Many of them , in fact , must grow for several years before they bear fruit at all . This makes seed selection a slow and tedious process . Also , most of them do not come true to seed . These early horticulturists soon found out that seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple , a pear , or almost any other ? might or might not produce trees as good as its parent . More often it did not . And so men worked out a third important step in the science of fruit growing , what is now known as " vegetative propagation . " This was based on the discovery , made long before there were any historians to record it , that it was possible to plant a branch rather than a seed from a fruit tree . Sometimes the branch , or cutting , could be set directly in the soil , where it sprouted new roots . More often it was " planted , " or grafted , into the stem of another and similar tree , letting the already growing roots supply it with food from the soil . In other cases , " suckers " instead of cuttings were planted , or even sections of roots . Millions of Bushels from One Tree The important fact was that whenever a tree or bush was propagated in this way , the new plant produced fruit with exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally , a " chip off the old block . " Today virtually all of the cultivated fruit we eat is taken from plants propagated in this way . For example , one of our most popular apples , the Wihesap , has spread across the country by means of twigs or shoots budded or grafted into seedling apples . These shoots all trace originally to a single tree discovered more than two centuries ago . Because this one tree bore superior apples , it was transformed into thousands of trees which have produced millions of bushels of fruit ( page 330 ) . If you eat grapes of a popular variety known as Thompson Seedless , you are eating fruit from a plant which first sprouted almost 1,000 years ago . Naturally , the earliest selection and culture of fruit took place in areas where men first moved haltingly toward civilization . Thus it is not surprising that , of the cultivated fruits we know today , the largest number can be traced to two broad areas where the oldest civilizations grew up . One includes the sections of southeastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caspian Sea . From here , in addition to apples , came pears , cherries , figs , olives , and most of our plums and grapes . The other is the part of central and southern Asia that stretches from China through Burma and eastern India southeast into the Malay Archipelago . There , thousands of years before the Christian Era , men were eating and learning to cultivate peaches , apricots , bananas , mangoes , and , a little later , oranges and lemons . " American " Varieties Grow Up As men and civilization spread from these areas through Europe and eventually around the world , they took their improved fruits with them , either as seeds or plants . When America was settled , the choicest kinds of fruits from Europe were transplanted to our shores ... Even though the art of grafting was well known , and some grafted trees were brought over , most of the earliest plantings were seedlings . The Indians in many cases secured seed of the European fruits and planted them about their villages . Thus , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance of the settlements , groves of fruit trees , mainly seedlings , became established . These seedling trees were highly variable . Occasionally one would be found bearing unusually good fruit . As the country became settled , these superior trees were propagated , given local names , and more or less widely tested . Many of our present varieties began this way . Others have been brought in directly from older countries .

Private individuals began to cross varieties , grow the resulting seed to fruiting , and evaluate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strawberries , raspberries , and American plums , but all fruits received some attention . Many excellent varieties resulted from such efforts . A little later , after the State agricultural experiment stations and the U. S. Department of Agriculture were organized , a number of such Government-supported stations began fruitbreeding work . This made possible the development of more extensive and longer-range work than could be conducted by private growers . Today a more extensive program of fruit improvement than ever before is under way in this country . Using new techniques discovered by geneticists , breeders sometimes even alter hereditary characteristics of the plant cells themselves and produce hybrids of plants which could never have been crossed naturally . In this way they work to combine qualities such as superior flavor , large size , and abundant production with others like resistance to disease , hardiness to cold , and late ( or early ) ripening . Production of just a few greatly improved varieties of berries , plums , apples , or grapefruit may pay the cost of research many times over. * The War Against Pests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continent , they did not always travel alone . With them , hidden in the fruits themselves or in the leaves , bark , or roots , sometimes rode insects or their eggs or larvae . Other stowaways were the fungi , bacteria , and viruses which cause plant diseases.t Often , too , in the new land to which the fruit moved , new pests were waiting ? pests to which they had developed no resistance . As transportation improved and commerce increased , it became less and less easy to keep these bugs and blights localized . A good example is the phylloxera , or root louse , which feeds on the roots of native American grapes . Here it causes little damage : the American plants are largely resistant to it . Taken to Europe , however , probably on the roots of American vines , it threatened to wipe out Europe 's great grape and wine industry . The European vines were saved only by grafting them on the roots of American grapes , a practice still followed today ( page 345 ) . A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About half a century ago it was transported from Asia to the eastern United States . There , in the absence of natural enemies , it spread steadily . It still causes heavy damage to crops . A virus disease of citrus , apparently carried in trees from Africa , has destroyed a large portion of the citrus orchards of South America . These must now be toilsomely replanted on rootstocks resistant to the disease . In recent decades strict regulations have been set up to control the spread of such diseases and pests to the United States . Thus men , having undertaken the job of propagating and breeding fruit trees in order to harvest their food , have also been forced to take over a large part of the fight against their insect and disease enemies . The modern orchardist must know these pests ? their life stories , how they pass the winter , when they invade the foliage and fruit . He must know what materials to use and when to spray to control specific insects and blights . He uses mechanized equipment costing thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can pump tens of gallons of liquid a minute over wide areas , and even planes and helicopters to fly low and dust treetops . The cost of such equipment , combined with the superiority of the fruit it helps to produce . has tended more and more to concentrate fruit growing into large commercial enterprises . gradually squeezing out the small , local farm orchard and the back-yard grower . Vith such heavy investments , commercial fruit growers can ill afford to lose a season 's crop to frost , drought , heat , or humidity . Thus they confine their operations to areas where climate and water supply are dependable and best suited to the individual fruit . This tendency to concentrate large orchards in fairly limited areas has led , in the past few decades , to another revolution in the fruit industry . It is mainly concerned with the problem of getting the fruit from the grower to the market. $ To move fresh fruit to consumers while it is still fresh , there are now fast freight trains and vast fleets of refrigerated railroad cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution .

Quick-freezing of fresh fruit for home use began commercially about 25 years ago ; most of the expansion has taken place in the past decade . Yet this year Americans will consume more than 500,000,000 pounds of frozen fruit . Frozen concentrated orange juice , developed almost entirely since World War II , already uses up almost one-fourth of our orange production ( page 352 ) .

In return he gets a huge food crop which supplies him with a large part of the vitamins , minerals , and other nutrients he must eat to stay healthy . Americans are lucky to have , within the borders of their country , a wide variety of soils and climates suitable for growing fruit . Thus of the fruits whose pictures and histories are presented on the following pages , all but four are grown extensively in the United States . The Pacific States particularly , with equable climates ranging from cool to subtropical , are ideal for orchards and vineyards and now produce about half the Nation 's fruit . This year , if you are a typical American , you will eat about 200 pounds of fresh , canned , dried , and frozen fruit ? which makes you by far the biggest consumer in the civilized world. * * For this article and the biographies which follow , these books have been used extensively as sources of historical material : Origin of Cultivated Plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by U.

There is no State in the Union ? and hardly a temperate land in the world ? which does not grow apples to some extent . They blossom throughout Europe and across Asia ? in Russia , Siberia , China , Korea , and India ; they are picked and eaten in Japan , Australia , New Zealand , and South America . The apple 's popularity is not all due to its flavor , which seems equally effective raw or in a steaming deep-dish pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stand temperatures down to 40 ? below zero F. and will also grow in warm climates , provided that there is a moderate winter to give the trees a rest . Thus it can thrive in areas where few other fruit trees survive . America regards the apple and the apple pie as its own , producing more of both than any other country . Actually , the fruit is an immigrant . It came , along with the first white men , from Europe . Apples Were a Stone Age Crop There are many species of apples , or crab apples , but the one from which our present varieties were developed , Malus pumila , probably started in southwestern Asia in the area from the Caspian to the Black Sea . Long before recorded history begins , however , apples had spread across Europe . The Stone Age lake dwellers of central Europe used them extensively . Remains found in their habitations show that they not only stored fresh apples for eating but also preserved them by cutting and drying in the sun . Cultivation of the apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Greek writer Theophrastus mentions a number of varieties grown in Greece in the 4th century B. C. And according to mythology , an apple ( albeit a gold one ) was awarded to the goddess Aphrodite in what may have been the world 's first beauty contest . At the time of the discovery of America , apples were central and northern Europe 's most important cultivated fruit . Not surprisingly , they were taken along by the first settlers to the temperate regions of the New World ? by the English to Virginia and New England , the Dutch to New York , and the French to Canada . Once started , seedling apple plantings moved west faster than the white settlers did . Some Indian tribes planted orchards around their villages . John Chapman , an itinerant missionary better known as Johnny Appleseed , roamed Ohio and Indiana early in the 19th century teaching the Gospel and planting apples . Apple seeds were planted at Vancouver , Washington , as early as 18 ' 17 . Though their ancestors came from Europe , most apple varieties now popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple does not come true from seed ; 100 trees grown from seed of a single tree will all differ from each other and from the parent . Thus occasionally a chance seedling found in a pasture or fence row will prove better than the varieties previously known . When this happens , if the new tree is discovered , named , and propagated by grafting or budding , it becomes a new variety . In a fruit-growing community , such a discovery is not unlike finding a new oil well or a gold mine . Grateful citizens may even erect a monument to mark the site where a new apple was born . A tall memorial pillar , topped with a huge stone apple , marks the spot where the first Baldwin apple tree was found in Wilmington , Massachusetts . Another , in Dundas County , Ontario , Canada . shows where one John McIntosh stumbled on the apple that bears his name while clearing forestland . These and some of our other important varieties , like the Winesap and Yellow Newtown , date back to colonial days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , was discovered a little more than half a century ago in Winterset , Iowa . Greatest centers of commercial production in the United States today are in the irrigated valleys of the Pacific Northwest , particularly Washington ; in the areas south and east of the Great Lakes ? in New York , Ohio and Michigan ; and in the foothills and valleys east of the Appalachian range , from North Carolina to New England . Commercial orchards produce about 120,000,000 bushels of apples a year ; total production , including home garden trees and small farm orchards . may run as high as 150,000,000 bushels . Crab Apples , Small and Sour The name crab apple is popularly applied to trees that give small fruit ( Y2 inch to 1 inch diameter ) , usually very acid and tart in flavor . These may be " native " ( unimproved ) species , or crosses of small-fruited species with cultivated varieties . A good many kinds of crab apple are n't grown to eat at all but as flowering shrubs . Most crab apples grown for fruit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baccata with standard apples , and are generally called Siberian crabs . They are particularly popular in Canada because they are extremely hardy and early ripening . In northern Europe many varieties of crab apple are grown for making cider . American housewives like them for pickles and jelly .  | WHEN you dive into a pear , " a fruit lover once remarked as he tucked in his napkin , " you never know whether you 're going to strike water or sand . " The great variation in pears sold in our markets ? from the softest , juiciest of fruit to one of the hardest and grittiest can be blamed chiefly on a tiny bacterium with a musical name , Erwinia amylovora . Except for Erwinia , the gritty sand pears probably would not be grown in the United States to any extent . The common pear , Pyrus communis , like its cousin , the apple , seems to have come originally from western Asia and near-by Europe . Like the apple , it was used as food by Stone Age men and improved by the pre-Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperate parts of the Old World . When America was discovered , pear culture was common throughout Europe , and pear seed and some trees were brought over by the earliest colonists . At first , like the peach and the apple , the pear trees thrived and produced abundantly in the new land . As early as 1771 the famous Prince Nursery on Long Island , greatest of colonial fruit nurseries , listed 42 varieties of pears . Belgians Breed for Butter Meanwhile in Europe , particularly in France and Belgium , horticulturists were working to produce new and better varieties of pears . In the 18th and 19th centuries many breeders named superior types , though two deserve particular credit . Nicolas Hardenpont ( 1705-44 ) , a priest in Mons , Belgium , grew quantitic : of seedling trees and produced the first of the varieties having the soft , melting flesh that gave the best pears the nickname " butter fruit . " Later , Jean Baptiste van Mons ( 1765-1842 ) , a Leuven , Belgium , physician , developed pear breeding on a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the improved varieties made their appearance in American orchards , so did Erwinia amylovora . These bacteria invade the bark , roots , and other soft tissues of the tree , causing oozing cankers and giving the infected parts a scorched appearance which accounts for the popular name of the disease , fire blight . It kills off large limbs and eventually whole trees . Fire blight was first observed in America as early as 1780 , but it was not until a century later that Dr. Thomas Jonathan Burrill , a University of Illinois plant pathologist , worked out the cause . Unfortunately , no one has yet worked out an effective control , and down to the present day pear blight makes growing the highquality " butter " pears of Europe extremely hazardous in most of the United States east of the Rockies . In eastern Asia another kind of pear had developed , P. pyri f olia , hard of flesh and with numerous " sand " or grit cells . These sand pears , still widely grown in China and Japan . reached the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite resistant to fire blight , also to the teeth and palates of the consumers . Softer , but Still Sandy Hybrids of sand pears and European varieties soon appeared , starting as chance seedlings where trees stood adjacent in orchards . The most important of these , the Kieffer , first fruited in 1873 . Hybrids are now grown extensively in the eastern half of the United States ; they are blight-resistant and better to eat than the original sand pears , but still inferior to the best European kinds . In recent years research has been started to breed better blight-resistant varieties for eastern growers . In the mild , dry-summered valleys of California , Oregon , and Washington , the best European varieties grow near to perfection . From here come most of the commercially grown pears used for canning and for sale as fresh fruit about two-thirds of the annual national crop of 30,000,000 bushels . Millions of bushels from these three States have been shipped back to the Low Countries of Europe , whence their ancestors came . Pears are an important crop in all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 100,000,000 bushels a year . France , Germany , Italy , and Switzerland lead in production . In France , particularly , many pears are made into perry , a fermented pear cider . Argentina and Australia are also among the important producing countries . The Sour Quince Makes Good Jelly To most Americans the quince , Cydonia oblonga , is just a name on a jelly jar or a nugget in a fruitcake . Closely related to the pear , appears to be native to northern Persia , was known in Greece and Italy long before the Christian Era , and was brought to this country by the earliest colonists . For a time its low , gnarled trees were widely grown in back-yard orchards . It has since fallen into disrepute , so much so that in American slang " quince " denotes a particularly unpleasant or sour person , usually female . A few small commercial plantings satisfy the steady domestic demand for preserves and flavoring.  | WHAT fruit besides the peach can be eaten whole like an apple , sliced with cream , dried , stewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine liqueur , cooked into pie or jam ? or frozen into delicious ice cream ? Partly due to its amazing versatility , partly because its flavor and texture are unsurpassed , the peach ranks near the top in popularity in the United States . In recent years annual production has averaged more than 70 , - 000,000 bushels . It is also extensively grown in Europe , Asia , South Africa , Australia , and South America . Despite trouble with diseases and insects , it is much grown in small orchards and even back yards . In fact , some of the best thin-skinned , soft-fleshed varieties , like the Cumberland and Golden Jubilee , are so delicate they may be damaged in handling and shipping , and are best grown where long trips to the market are not necessary . Americans show their high regard for the peach in symbolism . To tell a young lady she has a " peaches-and-cream " complexion is a high compliment ; to describe the lady herself as a peach is also flattering , if less subtle . The Chinese thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree of life , others the tree of death ; still others thought it symbolized longevity . The pink peach blossom , for some reason , was associated in ancient China with feminine promiscuity , and all growers were warned against planting peach trees near the windows of a lady 's boudoir . How a Name Misplaced a Fruit The word " peach " is based on a Latin word meaning Persian . The scientific name , Prunus persica , also implies origin in Persia ; peaches , in fact , used to be called " Persian apples . " Thus for more than 2,000 years the native home of the peach was believed to be Persia . This belief , however , has not stood up under scientific scrutiny in the past century . In tracking down the origin of a plant , scientists , like detectives , must piece together a variety of clues . One hint that Persia was not the home of the peach was the fact that there was no mention of the fruit in early Hebrew literature or in Sanskrit ; this would indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western India about 1500 B. C. Looking farther east , botanists found peaches of a number of types which appeared to be native over large areas of China , with all the characteristics of the western fruit . Moreover , peaches are mentioned in Chinese literature earlier than 2000 B. C. Most recent students therefore agree that China is undoubtedly the native home of the peach . The range of the species probably was wide , extending over much of the country from Turkistan as far as the eastern coast . Once its home was settled as China , it was comparatively easy for botanists to trace the fruit 's slow progress westward . Exactly how and when it reached Persia is unknown , but it probably traveled from China along caravan routes used in the pre-Christian Era . By 332 B. C. it had reached Greece ? where a Greek writer described it as a Persian fruit . Virgil ( 70-19 B. C. ) was the first Roman to mention the peach . Its culture spread all over the temperate parts of Europe in the centuries that followed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; by 1571 three types were growing in Mexico . The French in Louisiana , the English at Jamestown , the Pilgrims in Massachusetts , and others planted peaches as soon as their settlements were established . The Indians , always alert to new food supplies , carried them inland far in advance of white settlements . Practically all varieties now grown in this country started here , most of them through chance discovery of superior trees among the many seedlings . Within the past 50 years Government experiment stations , both State and Federal , as well as some private researchers , have been systematically breeding peaches to develop good-quality varieties . The peach is not one of the hardiest fruits . Fruit buds are often killed by winter temperatures of 10 ? below zero F. , and temperatures down to - 20 ? F. will frequently kill trees . Most varieties also need a fairly long winter dormant season to start growth normally in spring . In the United States , peaches do best in the Pacific Coast States , especially California ; along the Atlantic seaboard from Georgia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in New York , Ohio . and Michigan . Nectarine , the Same Fruit , but No Fuzz The nectarine , not widely known in the United States , is a smooth-skinned , or fuzzless , peach . It is indistinguishable from the peach in tree , leaf , or flower . Fruits are similar in shape , in pit , or stone , and both have varieties that have white , yellow , or red flesh color . Nectarines are usually somewhat smaller , firmer-fleshed , more aromatic , and have a distinct flavor often richer than the peach . They originate as true breeding mutations of the peach , and have been esteemed in Old World countries for more than 2,000 years . But , because their smooth skin makes them vulnerable to insects , disease . and cracking , they are not as successful as peaches in the humid eastern United States . They reach our markets in limited quantities . mainly shipped from the western States .  | APRICOTS and Japanese plums are two more of the great group of stone fruits , or drupes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peach , all containing a single hard , woody pit . These two are considered together because they are both believed to have originated in China . Their routes around the world , however , were quite different , as are the ways in which they are eaten . The apricot , though juicy and aromatic when fresh , is one of the fruits which most Americans seem to prefer dried or canned . Of the more than 200,000 tons a year grown in this country , about 40 percent are dried , 40 percent are commercially canned , and 20 percent are sold fresh . The apricot reached the Mediterranean countries before the time of Christ . It has been claimed that Alexander the Great carried it to Greece at the time of his conquest of southwestern Asia , in the 4th century B. C. It was long said to have come from Armenia , hence the botanical name Prunus armeniaca , by which it is known to this day . More recent botanical and language research , however , has indicated that the original home of the apricot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no name for the fruit in either the Hebrew or Sanskrit languages , as would be expected if the fruit was present in the area when these languages were developed . On the other hand , the Chinese used a character believed to represent the apricot in writings earlier than 2000 B. C. Also , in China today apricots are found which have all indications of being truly indigenous . Believed to Be Native of China Thus it is now generally believed that the apricot originated in central and western China , and that it had been carried to southwest Asia before the time of Alexander the Great . Pliny stated it reached Italy about 100 B. C. It had spread throughout the temperate parts of Europe , including England , before the discovery of America . The Spaniards apparently took the apricot to the New World with the earliest settlements . It thrived in the drier parts of Mexico . Seedlings were planted in California at the Spanish missions in the 18th century , and named varieties from Europe were introduced before 1850 . The English also established apricots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that apricots were thriving there . However , the apricot has never proved well adapted to the climate of the eastern United States . The name " apricot " comes from a Latin word praecoquum , meaning early ripe . Because it blooms very early in the spring , its blossoms are almost always killed in the East by spring frosts . The fruit also tends to crack badly and decay in warm , rainy weather . Apricot growing in the United States is therefore largely confined to the area west of the Rockies , with California producing by far the largest part of the crop . Washington . Oregon , and Utah also produce commercial quantities of apricots . Burbank Promoted Japanese Plums Little is known of the background of the highly colored , juicy , spicy plums of the species P. salicina , known in this country as Japanese .

It seems almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the southwest part , a region little explored by western botanists . These plums first reached America about 1870 ; trees from Japan were imported in that year by a fruit grower of Vacaville , California .

Luther Burbank , the great plant breeder . who moved from Massachusetts to California . imported many kinds , grew numbers of seedlings , and highly publicized the fruit . He gave American names to imported varieties and to selections from his seedlings . More than any other man , Burbank was responsible for the rapid spread and great interest in Japanese plums . These plums apparently were unknown in Europe prior to their introduction into this country . In recent years they have been widely tested in temperate countries throughout the world .

The flowers are large for lum and have a pink tinge , an unusual : : . racteristic since plum flowers are generally re white or green tinged .

The Red , Horse , Hog , or Goose Plum A third great species , P. americans , is well named . It spreads over about half the area of the United States , from New York to Montana and south to Louisiana and Mississippi . In most sections it is simply called wild plum , but it is also known as Red plum , Yellow plum , Horse plum , Hog plum , Goose plum , August plum , and , in the far south , Sloe . The fruit ripens mainly in July in the south , and in September in the north . While the plums vary somewhat in different areas , they are generally nearly round , reddishorange to red , and one inch or less in diameter . This plum has contributed many varieties of value , especially in the western Plains States . The Chickasaw plum , P. angusti f olia , is native in the southern States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas . The fruit is oval to spherical , usually bright red , but sometimes yellow . It does not survive in the north . The sand plum of the western Plains , closely related to the Chickasaw , is one of the most valued fruits in Kansas and Nebraska . Two species of plums native in the lower Mississippi Valley are valuable both as native fruits and as sources of cultivated varieties . Both are found from Tennessee and Kentucky west to Kansas and Oklahoma . P. hortulana is late ripening , its fruit nearly round , about one inch in diameter , color , red to yellow . The wild Goose plum , P. munsoniana , is early ripening , fruit round to oval , bright red . Both are late blooming , so the blossoms are likely to escape spring frosts . One other species deserves mention , not because it is widely distributed , but because the quality of the fruit closely approaches that of the European plums . P. subcordata , the Pacific or Western plum , is found in the foothills from central California to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red to purple , about one inch in diameter , and is extensively used for preserves . Improving the American Plum While the colonists who settled along the eastern seaboard gathered plums from the wild to some extent , there was little effort to improve them during colonial times . Perhaps this was because good-quality European varieties could be produced in the central and northern colonies at least . Not until settlers crossed the Mississippi were native plums of special merit selected , named , and planted in home orchards . During the last half of the 19th century , literally hundreds of such selections were made and named . Many of these represented little improvement and soon passed out of use . Breeders , both private and in State experiment stations , have continued efforts to improve these plums , and a number of varieties are now available that are of great value where European varieties do not thrive . Particularly in the Plains States , the North Central States , and in the South , these varieties are more satisfactory for home and local market growing than are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year Americans consume fresh or in pies , candies , preserves , beverages , and assorted drugstore delicacies about 200,000 tons of cherries . Round , plump , and abundant ? a single tree has been known to yield 2,000 pounds of fruit in one year ? cherries have for centuries been looked on as the symbol of ripeness and sweetness . Species of cherries are plentiful throughout the northern Temperate Zone ? from Japan , throughout Asia and Europe , to our own Pacific Coast . Asiatic species have contributed the famous flowering cherries of Japan , now flourishing and famous in our own Capital and gaining popularity as ornamentals in many American gardens and parks . The fruit of a few American species is gathered and used to a limited extent , particularly the chokecherries and sand cherries in the Plains and Rocky Mountain States . The two species that have furnished our cherries of commerce , however , both appear to have originated in the area of Asia and Europe centering about the Dardanelles and extending from the Caspian Sea in Asia westward through the Balkan countries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet cherries , Prunus avium , had spread throughout temperate Europe before the beginning of civilization there . Commonly known as bird cherries , this species , a favorite food of birds , had reached Britain and western continental Europe before the history of those countries was recorded . Pits of sweet cherries found in the remains of cave habitations of central Europe indicate that these fruits were gathered and used there as early as the Stone Age . The sour , or pie cherry , P. cerasus , seems to have spread more slowly , and perhaps mainly through human agencies . Apparently the earliest reference to cherries is by Theophrastus , the Greek " Father of Botany , " who described the trees and fruit about 300 B. C. Pliny , in Italy in the first century , described 10 kinds of cherries . These appear to have been types , rather than varieties as we regard them today . He also referred to the cherry as having been taken to Britain . Another Roman , Marcus Terentius Varro , in his book on farming written about 50 B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that neither cherry culture nor grafting were new when he wrote . Thus cherry culture was apparently under way in a number of European countries by the beginning of the Christian Era . Little further progress seems to have occurred until the emergence of Europe from the Dark Ages , in the 15th and 16th centuries . Not until the latter century did variety names appear . Cherries from Europe were introduced into America as soon as the English , French , and Dutch settlements were made . If cherries were planted by the Spaniards in the West Indies and Florida , they did not thrive . But in the cooler climates , from Newfoundland to Virginia , they were growing shortly after the first settlements . Reference is made to the cultivation of the Red Kentish cherry in Massachusetts in 1629 , only nine years after the Pilgrims landed . By the middle of that century , cherries , in common with other Temperate Zone fruits of Europe , were widely distributed in the Colonies . According to tradition , if not fact , one early American farmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the veracity of his son George . Cherries advanced westward with the settlement of the country . They were first taken to California by the Spanish missionaries when that State was a part of Mexico . Cherries were a part of the covered wagon load of named fruit varieties that pioneer horticulturist Henderson Luelling took to Oregon in 1847 . This resulted in the start of the great sweet-cherry industry in the western States . The cherry thrives best in moderate , rather cool climates . The sour cherry is more tolerant of both summer rainfall and winter cold than is the sweet . The latter cracks and rots when rains occur near ripening time . As a result of this , the principal centers of sweetcherry production are in the States west of the Rockies where summers are dry and winters are generally moderate . Sour cherries are produced throughout the northern half of the United States , except in the coldest areas of the Plains States . Greatest production is around the Great Lakes , with Michigan , New York , and Wisconsin leading . Neither the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often humid conditions in the southern half of the country . First Bing Cherries Were American Our important sour cherry varieties all represent direct importations from Europe ; no important varieties have been developed in this country . On the other hand , several of our sweet varieties , including the large , nearly black Bing and Lambert , which are the most important fresh market kinds , originated here as chance seedlings . Sour cherries are mainly marketed canned or frozen . The major use is in pies and preserves . Sweet cherries are popular in midsummer on fresh-fruit markets , the richly flavored fruits being highly esteemed . They are also canned commercially , and are the principal source of maraschino cherries .  | cope of were fungus diseases and insect pests that at.rt with tacked and destroyed the plantings of Old million World grapes .

In some Mediterranean countries , however , they are a basic part of the diet . Their importance in these areas is shown by legends that grew up about them in ancient times . The Romans considered the fig , Ficus carica , a gift of the god Bacchus . In the countries of southwestern Asia , in Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their significance in Hebrew life is indicated repeatedly in the Bible , beginning with the story of the Garden of Eden . A well-drawn fig tree , showing the harvesting 0f the fruit , is on the wall of a 12th dynasty Egyptian grave ( circa 1989-1776 B. C. ) . The species from which the cultivated , fig has come apparently had a wide range in the Area near the Mediterranean , from Syria westward to the Canary Islands . A fruit so long cultivated may have become naturalized in parts of the area , but fossil remains found in France and Italy indicate that figlike plants grew there long before the Stone Age . Aristotle Studied Fig Pollination Figs were probably first cultivated in Arabia and Egypt , and doubtless the sweeter , better kinds were selected and propagated with the beginning of agriculture in those ancient countries . They were known and prized in Crete in 1500 B. C. , and in Greece a little later . The Greeks even knew in part the need for caprification , a process whereby some of the fruit-bearing trees must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. , recorded that insects had to visit the young fruits or they would drop . He did not , however , fully understand why . Introduction of figs into America can be credited to the Spaniards . Varieties from Spain were sent to Hispaniola in 1520 , and were reported to be bearing well in 1526 . Before the end of the 16th century , figs were reported as abundant in Peru , and were established in Florida at St. Augustine . Capt . John Smith reported in 1629 that one " Mistress Pearce " of the Jamestown , Virginia , settlement , harvested " neere a hundred bushels of excellent figges . " In California the fig , like many other fruits , dates from the establishment of the mission at San Diego in 1769 . The variety now called Mission , which was planted there , is still the leading black fig grown in the State . Although figs were widely planted in gardens in California earlier , commercial culture did not start until about 1885 . Many varieties of figs will set fruit without pollination , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white , drying varieties , however , belong to a group known as the Smyrna type , and these must be pollinated . Many trees of this type were planted in California late in the last century and grew well , but the fruit dropped before maturing . Caprifigs , the trees used for pollinating this type in Europe and Asia , had been brought into the State . But the insect that carries the pollen into the fruit , a small wasp called the Blastophaga , was not present , and early efforts to introduce it were not successful . There was wide difference of opinion as to the necessity for the insect . Finally it was successfully established in the State through an importation in 1899 by the United States Department of Agriculture of caprifig fruits containing the Blastophaga wasps . This insect breeds in caprifigs , which are grown in special blocks away from the fruiting fig trees . At the proper time , the caprifigs are gathered with the wasps in them and hung in small bags in the fruit-bearing trees . The female wasps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . They crawl into the fruit of the Smyrna varieties seeking a place to lay eggs , and in the search pollinate the flowers . Since the introduction of the insect and the working out of suitable handling techniques , production of these Smyrna varieties in California has been successful . The fig is a semihardy tree which sheds its leaves in the winter . When fully dormant , the trees will stand temperatures down to about 10 ? F. without serious injury . Temperatures below 5 ? will kill them to the ground , but in most cases , when this happens , new shoots will sprout up from the roots . California Grows Most of Our Figs Most commercial fig growing in the United States is in California . About 35,500 acres there are devoted to figs , with an annual crop of some 32,000 tons of dried figs , 19,000 tons of fresh , and more than 700,000 cases of canned fruit . Figs are also grown commercially in Texas and as a home-garden fruit in other parts of the South . Most of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of it is canned or preserved . Figs are esteemed in the fresh form in countries where they are grown , but are difficult to ship and handle for distant markets . Italy is now the leading country of the world in fig production , most orchards being located south of Naples and on Sicily . Turkey ranks second . Spain , the United States , Algeria , Greece , and Portugal all have major industries . Many other countries with suitable climatic conditions produce figs on a smaller scale .  | IN CROWDED countries , or those where conditions are not suitable for extensive meat production , men turn to plants for the oil they must eat to live . In lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea , the olive tree supplies much of this need . From 20 to 60 percent of a ripe olive is oil . Men extract almost a million tons of oil a year from olives . In Spain , which leads the world in oliveoil production , 6 percent of agricultural production is in olives . In Greece the proportion runs as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in importance ; in Portugal they are the leading tree crop ? and the Portuguese consume nine-tenths of all the oil they produce . A Good Omen to Men Ever Since Noah The olive is another of the fruits that may be traced to the beginning of recorded history , and beyond . The earliest Hebrew books mention the olive under the name sait or zeit . The story of the dove from Noah 's Ark returning with an olive leaf , as told in the Book of Genesis , is familiar to all . The olive was a very important and valuable source of oil to the early Hebrews , and was also cultivated by the ancient Egyptians . Today the wild olive , Oleo europaea , is found from western India westward throughout southwest Asia and all about the Mediterranean borders . It is not certain that it is truly native throughout that range . In some districts , especially about the edges of the present range , the trees may be escapes from cultivation . Language research indicates that the true center of the olive species was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the olive was known and cultivated for its oil from the beginning of agriculture in Syria , in Palestine , in Egypt , in Greece , and , a little later , in Rome . The ancients used the oil for food , for medicine , and for anointing their bodies . In Rome a favorite saying was that a long and pleasant life depended on two fluids , " wine within and oil without . " Olive oil was also burned in lamps for lighting . The olive requires a long growing season to mature its fruit , and is not tolerant of low temperatures . The tree is injured when temperatures down to 15 ? to 10 ? F. occur . Thus its range in Europe is limited to countries around the Mediterranean . The Spaniards apparently introduced the olive into America . While it did not thrive in the humid climate and acid soil of the West Indies and Florida , it prospered in the drier air of Mexico . It was introduced into California with the establishment of the first missions . Since then , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California and , to a limited extent , in Arizona has commercial olive culture developed in the United States . The industry here is primarily based on olives for pickling . Oil is extracted from the fruit which fails to grow large enough for that purpose . The olive fruit is green in color when immature , turning to black as it ripens . For green olive pickles , the fruit is picked immature ; for black olive pickles , it is allowed to become mature on the tree , but not soft ripe . When harvested for oil , the fruit is allowed to ripen fully . The olive fruit fresh from the tree , both green and ripe , is intensely bitter . In the pickling process the fruit both for green and ripe pickles is first soaked in lye solution to destroy the bitter taste . After thorough washing to remove the lye , the ripe olives are soaked in strong salt solution . They can be held for a long period in brine , but should then be soaked in fresh water overnight to remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under steam pressures which hold them at a temperature of at least 240 ? F. for 60 minutes . In the preparation of green olives there are variations in the process to bring about the development of special flavors . Methods used to extract oil from olives vary greatly from one country to another . and depend in part on what the oil is to be used for . In some cases fruit is first crushed beneath rollers , then squeezed in presses ? which may be simply flat boards with stones on top , or . in modern plants , costly hydraulic machinery . Since the oil is contained in the pulp of the fruit , stones are sometimes removed before pressing . In all cases where the oil is to be eaten , speed is essential between harvesting and pressing ; oil left in bruised olives soon grows rancid . We Import as Much as We Grow There are large areas in the southwestern States of this country where olives can be grown successfully . Because of the great amount of hand labor , particularly in harvesting fruit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large scale here . Total production of olives in this country , almost entirely in California , averages about 50,000 tons of fruit per year , of which about half is used for pickling and half crushed for oil . American imports of olive oil amount to approximately 15,000 tons per year . In addition , about 10,000,000 gallons of green olive pickles are also brought in annually from south European countries , mainly Italy and Spain .  |  SAID MOHAMMED : " There is among the trees one that is preeminently blessed , as is the Moslem among men ; it is the palm . " Small wonder that desert dwellers of Arabia , Egypt , and westward to Algeria and Morocco call the date palm blessed . The fruit , containing more than half its weight in sugar and smaller quantities of fat and protein , is one of the most important food sources in a generally barren land . It furnishes shade for men and animals . The leaves are used for making baskets , matting , and bags , the fiber for rope . The roasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the palm becomes old and nonproductive , or before , it is tapped to draw off the sap , from which a toddy is made , called in ancient cuneiform inscription " the drink of life . " Finally , the trunks are used as fuel . The exact origin of the date palm , Phoenix dactylifera , is unknown . Certainly it is one of the oldest food plants known to mankind . Long before history begins , it grew in Arabia , Babylonia , and Egypt , as indicated by plant remains as well as by tradition and the oldest writings . Moisture Feeds Roots but Molds Fruits Although the date palm will grow throughout great areas of the world , wherever temperatures do not go lower than 5 ? to 10 ? F. , the areas where fruit production is successful are much more limited . Even a small amount of rain and humid weather as the fruit approaches maturity will cause it to mold and sour . Thus fruit production is largely limited to areas having very dry summer and fall seasons . Although grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil moisture . Thus they thrive only about springs or oases , or where they can be irrigated . Present Old World centers of date growing are the same countries that grew them in earliest times , Iran , Iraq , Arabia , Egypt , Libya , and Algeria . A few are grown in Spain , but in general date culture is meager in countries north of the Mediterranean . Too much rainfall and humidity are the chief limiting factors . No one knows exactly when date palms were first planted in the United States . Spanish missionaries planted seeds around the missions in the Southwest before 1800 , at the latest . The real beginning of date culture in the United States came in 1890 . In that year , the U. S. Department of Agriculture arranged for palms of some of the better varieties from Egypt to be planted in tubs and shipped to this country . Later , plantsmen from the Department visited all important date-grow- ing countries , secured offshoots of the better varieties , and successfully established them . Commercial firms followed with larger importations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior date varieties is by these offshoots , or " suckers , " which develop from the base of relatively young palms . The suckers , much like those that form near the base of corn plants , may be cut off when 3 to 5 years old . Carefully handled , especially as to watering , each will grow into a new palm . Since each palm produces only a relatively few offshoots. mainly in its early years , the multiplication of superior dates is a slow process . Only a few areas in this country are adapted to date-fruit culture . Our industry is centered in the interior desert valleys of southern California and Arizona , which have intensely hot , dry summers and autumns , much like Arabia and North Africa . The greatest concentration of planting is in the Coachella Valley in California , northwest of the Salton Sea . There are now some 5,000 acres of date palms in this country . with production averaging around 20,000,000 pounds a year . Even so , considerable quantities are still imported from southwest Asia , chiefly Iran . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dry . The soft dates are richly flavored , but are difficult to ship and handle . They are used extensively in various date confections . The semidry dates are those principally found in the markets of this country . The dry dates , little grown or sold in the United States , are relatively hard-meated , sweet , and nonperishable , and are a very important food in Arab countries . In our southwestern desert date centers. production practices have been studied more scientifically than any other place in the world , and Old World countries now look to us for technical information on date culture . The U. S. Department of Agriculture has maintained a research station for date investigations at Indio , California , almost from the start of date culture here . Flying Fans Make Artificial Breezes Such research has turned date growing in the United States into a complex science based on a mixture of tedious hand work and mechanization . Heavy paper wrappings are sometimes tied over individual bunches ? which may contain 1,000 or more fruit ? to guard against insects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tying male flower strands into female flower clusters with rubber bands . or with a pollen duster . On occasion , helicopters have been hired to fly low over date treetops and fan away moisture .  | THE orange industry , in the past halfcentury , has undergone one of the most astounding booms in the history of agriculture . In 1900 oranges were a luxury in most of the United States , a Christmas treat or a dessert for special occasions . Today oranges are for sale in every crossroads store the year round . Orange juice is a regular part of the breakfast of most children and many adults . In tons produced , in dollar volume , and in popular taste , oranges are our leading fruit . Most recent increase has come in the production of frozen , concentrated juice . From almost nothing before World War II , frozen orange juice has grown into a $100,000,000-a-year business using about one-fourth of our total crop of some 4,000,000 tons a year . Oranges , Too , Got Their Start in Asia The native home of the orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread to every part of the world which has a suitable climate . The orange tree will withstand only a few degrees of frost . Temperatures of 25 ? F. will cause some injury to the trees , and temperatures below 20 ? will cause severe injury or death . The oranges of the world are classed in three principal kinds , each with many varieties . The most important , both in the United States and in most other countries , is the sweet orange , Citrus sinensis . These oranges are relatively sweet , generally round to oval in shape , and the peel adheres rather tightly to the pulp , or flesh . The mandarin oranges , C. reticulata , have thin , loose skin that separates very readily from the pulp . The segments of the pulp also separate easily . These can be further classed as the tangerines , having dark , orangered peel , and the satsumas , having lighter , yellow peel . The mandarin oranges are the kinds most extensively grown in China and Japan . The third group , the sour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bitter for eating out of hand . They are used for making marmalade and for ade drinks in some countries . Sweet and mandarin oranges have undoubtedly been eaten in south China since the country was inhabited . References to oranges in Chinese writing date back to about 2200 B. C. Their spread to other countries , however , was relatively slow . The sweet orange is not mentioned in European writing until after the beginning of the 15th century . As with the lemon ( page 356 ) , Columbus carried seed of the sweet orange when he sailed in 1493 to establish a settlement on Hispaniola . The orange flourished there ; early in the 16th century it was taken to Mexico and Central America . It was planted in Florida when St. Augustine was settled in 1565 . It may have reached Florida even earlier , but there is no definite record to this effect . Two centuries later , settlers found many wild orange groves , spread by seed from early plantings , in central Florida . These were growing about the lakes and , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild grove , described in 1764 , was 40 miles long . Not until Florida became a part of the United States in 1821 , however , did a commercial industry start . The sweet orange reached California with the establishment of the mission at San Diego in 1769 , and was carried to other missions as they were established . A planting of some 400 trees at the Mission of San Gabriel about 1804 represented the first sizable citrus orchard in the State . The mandarin oranges , outranking the sweet oranges in popularity in China and Japan , did not reach Europe until 1805 . By 1850 they were well known in Mediterranean countries . The first recorded introduction into the United States was by the Italian consul at New Orleans , who planted Chinese mandarins there between 1840 and 1850 . Research workers of the United States Department of Agriculture have crossed sweet oranges and tangerine oranges , the crosses being known as tangors . Such crosses also have occurred naturally and are among the most delicious of our citrus fruits . Florida Raises Most Oranges Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close second , followed by Texas , Arizona , Louisiana , and Mississippi . In Florida and California , orange production is highly organized and strongly competitive . Both States have laws regulating the maturity , quality , and even the sweetness of oranges sold . To prevent diseases and molds which result from damaged skins , the fruit is picked by skilled workers , often wearing soft cloth gloves . Long conveyor belts may then carry the ripe oranges through successive washings in soap and water , borax solution , and clean water . Mechanical brushes scrub them as they go through the bath ; then they are dried in wind tunnels . Some are even coated with wax for additional protection . Grading the fruit , wrapping them in tissue paper , and packing are done by hand . Spain , Brazil , China , Japan , Italy , and Palestine are heavy orange producers ; in fact . all tropical and subtropical countries produce considerable quantities .  | AMERICA has given grapefruit to the world , although the grapefruit , like most of us living in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grapefruit , we must consider first the pummelo , or shaddock , Citrus grandis . The native home of the pummelo is not definitely known .

The pummelo fruit is very large , often up to 8 inches in diameter . It has the color and general appearance of a very large , coarse , thick-skinned grapefruit . The membranes that enclose the segments are extremely tough . The tree is large for citrus , and a vigorous grower . The pummelo apparently reached Europe about the same time as did the lemon ( by , or before , the middle of the 12th century ) . Known under the name " Adam 's apple , " it was grown mainly as a garden curiosity . There is no record that the Spanish took the pummelo to the New World . It was first recorded as being in the West Indies in 1696 by Hans Sloane , in a catalogue of plants of Jamaica . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an East Indian ship , who stopped at Barbados on his way to England and left seed of the pummelo there . Captain Shaddock not only introduced the fruit to the Americas but gave this ancestor of the grapefruit its generally known English name . First Known as " Forbidden Fruit " The grapefruit , so far as is known , originated in the West Indies , but the exact place or manner of its origin is unknown . It was first described in 1750 by Griffith Hughes , in his publication The Natural History of Barbados , under the name " Forbidden fruit . " A little later the forbidden fruit , or " smaller shaddock , " was said to be " cultivated in most parts of the country ( Barbados ) . " The name grapefruit originated in Jamaica , apparently either from a belief that the fruit resembled the grape in flavor , or from the fact that the fruit is frequently borne in clusters . The characteristics of the grapefruit suggest that it might have come from a cross of the shaddock and the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed indicates , however , that it is not a hybrid . Its seed progeny is typically grapefruit , instead of showing the characteristics of two parents . It seems most probable that the grapefruit originated as a mutation of the pummelo , or shaddock . Although grapefruit was described from Barbados in 1750 , almost 100 years passed before it was introduced into Florida . Don Phillippe , a Spanish nobleman , planted trees at Safety Harbor , Florida , presumably from seed from the West Indies . The exact date of this planting is not known , but it is believed to have been about 1840 . From these Phillippe trees and their seed progeny most of our grapefruit varieties have come . The grapefruit 's rise in popularity ? after a comparatively slow start ? has been meteoric . For several decades after it was brought to Florida the grapefruit was hardly known outside the State . There were no shipments to northern markets until after 1880 . At the turn of the century only a few thousand boxes a year were being produced ; individual grapefruit were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about when served at the table . Yet in 10 short years , by 1910 , production had reached 1,000,000 boxes a year . It has grown steadily since , until today America produces some 50,000,000 boxes a year ( about 80 pounds to a box ) . Today 's cultivated grapefruit trees are highly productive . They grow from 15 to 25 feet high , and have dark green leaves ; a single tree , when mature , may produce up to 1,500 pounds of fruit a year . End of the Seedy Core The grapefruit of the early years was seedy , but a tree producing nearly seedless fruit was discovered near Lakeland , Florida . and propagated about 1890 . This tree was the start of the nearly seedless variety , Marsh . which is now the most widely grown kind . Still later , mutations having pink color in the flesh were found , some of them seedless , or nearly so . Today the pink-fleshed , seedless varieties command a premium on the freshfruit markets . The State of Florida , cradle of grapefruit culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since 1925 there has been a great development in grapefruit growing in the Rio Grande Valley in the extreme southern tip of Texas . Arizona and California also produce substantial quantities . When the fruit became so popular in this country , other citrus-producing areas also became interested in it , and today grapefruit is grown to some extent in all citrus-growing countries . Nowhere else , however , has it become as popular as in the United States . Grapefruit have been crossed with a number of other kinds of citrus . Crosses with tangerine oranges have produced a new class of fruits called tangelos . These are usually juicy , rather thin-skinned fruits which peel easily and have a rich flavor.  | LEMONS and limes probably have more varied uses than any other citrus fruit . In many parts of the world , one or the other is used to flavor fish , meat , pies , puddings , and other food . In the United States lemon juice is a popular ingredient in salad dressing , and also goes into much of the tea drunk . Both form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their richness in vitamin C makes both valuable additions to the diet . Sales of lemons in this country are noticeably linked to the prevalence of colds as well as to hot weather . British sailors were first called ' ' limeys " because of the quantities of limes furnished them on shipboard to prevent scurvy , a disease caused by lack of vitamin C. Yet , despite their value and versatility , both fruits are limited to a comparatively small share of the citrus market . The reason is obvious : in a beverage glass one small lemon or lime does the work of two or three good-sized oranges . The Orient Grows a Sweeter Lemon The lemon , Citrus Union , and the lime , C. aurantifolia , are closely linked botanically and historically . Both occur as sweet fruits , as well as the highly acid fruits we know . The sweet varieties are chiefly prized in Oriental countries . Their native home is believed by most authorities to be the warm , humid district to the east of the Himalayas . in northern Burma , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , have tended to naturalize in any country in which they are well adapted , so the exact original home can not be determined . The Arabs established the lemon , and apparently the lime also , in Persia and Palestine , and both undoubtedly were growing in those countries at the time of the Crusades . European writers mention lemons and limes only after that time , and there is strong evidence that the returning Crusaders carried these fruits , as well as sour oranges , to Europe . By the middle of the 13th century they were recorded as well known in Italy . The date of the introduction of citrus fruits , including lemons and limes , into the Western Hemisphere is well established . On his second voyage to the New World , to establish a colony , Columbus took seeds of many plants . It is recorded that he stopped at the island of Gomera , one of the Canary group , from October 5 to October 13 , 1493 , and while there secured seeds of oranges , lemons , and many vegetables . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement at Isabela , not far from the present town of Monte Cristi . Apparently the citrus that he planted prospered , for some 30 years later the abundance of citrus trees on the island was described as beyond counting . The Spanish conquerors carried citrus fruits to the mainland of Mexico and Central America in the early years of the 16th century . The Portuguese had established them in Brazil by 1540 . They were planted at St. Augustine , Florida , when the Spanish settled there in 1565 . Soon groves of seedling citrus . spread by the Spanish and Indians , were present in various parts of Florida . It was two centuries later that the Franciscan padres established at San Diego the first mission in what is now California . They moved there from Mexico and presumably took with them the fruits they had been cultivating , among them , lemons and limes . Under commercial culture the lemon is subject to serious diseases in hot , humid climates . An early lemon-growing industry in Florida was wiped out by a great freeze in 1894-95 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had harassed growers even before the freeze . Today two great centers of lemon production have grown up , both with equably warm climates . One of these is southern Italy and Sicily . The other is in southern California . mainly in the counties near the coast , where the Pacific tempers both the winter cold and the summer heat . Curing Improves the Flavor Though lemons were introduced in California more than a century earlier , commercial production did not expand much until about 1880 . For years California lemons were regarded as inferior to the Italian . This has been blamed on the fact that growers there did not " cure " the fruit before shipping , a practice commonly followed in Italy . The curing process consists in picking the fruit while still green and allowing it to ripen in cool storage before packing for shipment . After adopting this practice , the California lemon industry grew rapidly ; the State now supplies more than half the worlds lemons . The lime thrives better than the lemon in hot , humid climates , being more resistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lime , instead of the lemon . is the predominant acid , or ale , fruit . Limes are grown extensively in Mexico and the West Indian islands . Production in the United States is mainly in southern Florida , although some are produced in California . Egypt leads the nations of the world in lime production , both sweet and sour kinds being grown there .  | BANANAS are the most important fruit in tropical lands around the world . Not only are they a major part of the diet for millions who live in the Tropics but they are also a leading export . About 90,000,000 bunches a year go into world trade , each bunch containing 10 to 20 " hands " of fruit and averaging about 50 pounds in weight . There are many reasons for the banana 's popularity . One is its high nutritive value . A banana contains as much as 22 percent carbohydrate , a rich source of food energy ; it also contains vitamins A and C. All these hidden benefits , moreover , are contained in a meat which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the banana 's favor are the ease and speed with which it grows . Banana " trees " are not really trees at all ; they are huge herbaceous plants which quickly shoot up to a height of 15 to 30 feet . The plant 's true stem is underground and has buds , or " eyes , " like a potato . These underground stems , or rhizomes , are transplanted to establish new plantings ; as with potatoes , each may be cut into several pieces . Ready to Eat in 18 Months Under favorable conditions , the leaf-bearing stalks appear above ground some three to four weeks after planting . They grow rapidly . The bloom appears about ten or twelve months after planting , and the fruit is mature five or six months later . The botanical name of the common banana of commerce , Musa sapientum , means " fruit of the Wise Men . " It traces to an ancient legend that the sages of India rested in the shade of the plant and ate of the fruit . A second species , M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it bears fruit similar to that of the common banana . These two species , native in southern Asia , probably India , and in the Malay Archipelago , have contributed the varieties of bananas grown throughout the world today . The closely related plantains , or cooking bananas , M. paradisiaca and M. f ehi , are important food plants in the Tropics . These fruits are not palatable raw since they remain starchy when ripe , but they are excellent food when cooked . All evidence shows that the banana is one of the oldest fruits known to mankind , perhaps one of the first plants to be cultivated . It had distinctive names in Sanskrit , in ancient Chinese , and in the Malay languages , indicating that it was known throughout much of southern Asia in prehistoric times . Bananas were found on all the tropical Pacific islands when those islands were first visited by white men . Apparently the fruit was transported with the waves of migration eastward from the Asiatic mainland to these islands . The first such immigration is believed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet Masudi , who died A. D. 956. extolled a dish popular in Damascus , Constantinople , and Cairo ? a confection of almonds , honey , and bananas in nut oil . This indicates that bananas had reached the Mediterranean shores by that date . Friar Tomas de Berlanga , a missionary priest , is authentically credited with introducing the banana into the New World . He brought plants from the Canary Islands to Hispaniola in 1516 . Shortly afterward , bananas were taken to the mainland of Mexico . The fruit thrived so well and spread so rapidly throughout the American Tropics that later visitors mistakenly thought the banana native on this continent . Growth of a Giant Fruit Industry Throughout the first half of the 19th century , vessels occasionally brought a few bunches of bananas from the West Indies into American ports . After the close of the Civil War this trade increased , but many shipments were overripe when they arrived . Between 1870 and 1880 American planters established commercial production in Central American countries , and , with steam vessels , delivery to northern markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production in Jamaica became commercialized , with regular shipments to Boston . At this time large numbers of companies were engaged in growing , shipping , and distributing bananas in the United States . Conditions in growing and marketing were chaotic , and there was great variability both in the supply and in the condition of the fruit delivered . In 1899 the principal companies in the banana trade incorporated as the United Fruit Company . The banana industry is now one of the most highly organized fruit industries of the world . Plantations are distributed throughout Central American countries , Colombia , and the West Indies , so that risk of crop failure is minimized . Railroads have been built to carry the fruit from the plantations to shipside . Modern refrigerated steamers transport the fruit to American ports ; there it is loaded into refrigerator cars for shipment to all parts of the Nation . About 60,000,000 bunches of bananas are sold annually in the United States , and this strictly tropical fruit is available in almost every food store in the country . Large quantities are also marketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the food staple of the Tropics , has become a world-wide article of commerce .  | MANGOES , possibly more than any other M fruit , have their critics and their enthusiasts . A true mango lover may develop an almost crusading spirit in promoting the fruit . In India , where mangoes are most widely grown and eaten , wealthy gardeners often collect varieties of mango trees ; one such garden is reported to contain 500 varieties . A leading American mango enthusiast is the naturalist and author , David Fairchild , first famous as a plant explorer for the U. S. Department of Agriculture . In his Florida home , The Kampong , he has collected and cultivated many fine varieties . His recent book , The World Grows Round My Door , contains a chapter on " The Gorgeous East Indian Mango " ; the following quotation from it gives an inkling of the feelings of a true mangophile : " Every morning in mango time , as I walk along the path . . . I have to lower my head to avoid striking one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I fondle it with my hands and watch the red blush growing larger and brighter every sunny day while its greenish-yellow tip turns to gold , my mouth watering for a taste of it . " On the other hand , there are the mangophobes , people who , after tasting a single mango , have pronounced the fruit inedible . They complain of a strong , rank flavor or , most often , say that it " tastes like turpentine . " It All Depends on the Mango Why the sharp difference of opinion ? The basis for it lies in the fruit itself . A superior variety of mango , properly ripened , is all that its supporters say it is one of the world 's finest fruits . An inferior mango , or an unripe one , is fibrous , tough , acid , and does have a flavor resembling turpentine . Early shipments of such inferior fruit from Florida to northern United States markets helped to start the mango off on the wrong foot in this country . It is this false first impression which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still little known in the United States outside of Florida , though it is one of the important fruits of most tropical countries . Its culture in the United States is limited to the southern third of Florida , and to the most favored locations there . Temperatures two or three degrees below freezing will kill or seriously injure the trees . Mango fruits are favored foods of a number of the fruit fly insects not now in the United States ? the Mediterranean fruit fly , the Oriental , and others . For this reason , fresh fruits can be shipped into the United States only from Mexico , and from there only after special treatments . Thus mangoes on American mar- kets are mainly those from the limited acreage in south Florida . The cultivated mango , Mangi f era indica , like the citrus fruits , is native to southeast Asia , probably also to the near-by islands . It has been known and cultivated in India since the beginning of agriculture there , and has long been one of the most important fruits of that country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Buddha in order that he might use it as a place of repose . Akbar , an emperor who reigned in northern India in the 16th century , is said to have planted a mango orchard of 100,000 trees , or well over 1,000 acres . at a time when large orchards were unheard of in any other part of the world . The mango was slow to be transported to other countries . The Portuguese probably carried it to East Africa , where mangoes are now common , and also first introduced it into America . They planted it at Bahia ( Salvador ) , Brazil , about 1700 . It reached the West Indies some 50 years after its introduction into Brazil , and was taken to Mexico from there early in the 19th century . First Florida Planting Failed Henry Perrine , a pioneer Florida horticulturist , took mangoes from Mexico to his place south of Miami in 1833 . These trees apparently were lost after Perrine 's death . A second introduction , about 1861 or 1862. was successful . These early plantings were seedling trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce choice Indian mangoes were unsuccessful , but in 1889 the U. S. Department of Agriculture brought in six varieties . Most of these trees were also lost , but at least one tree of the high-quality Mulgoba variety survived . When it began to bear , some nine years later , the superior quality , as compared to seedlings , attracted wide interest . Since then , many choice Oriental varieties have been established . The mango is a large tree with dense . glossy , green foliage . It is most fruitful in areas having alternate wet and dry periods during the year . Choice varieties are fastidious in their requirements ; not only are they very subject to low-temperature injury but the roots will not tolerate water-logged soil . Even under the favorable conditions in Florida . yield of fruit of the choice varieties has often been low . Some commercial canning of mangoes is done in Mexico and other large producing countries . In quality , canned mangoes are comparable to canned peaches .

One of these , the papaya , is little known in the United States . The avocado , on the other hand , is widely shipped from the limited areas where it can be grown , in California and Florida , to markets all over the country . In this country , avocados are used mainly in salads or desserts . In parts of Mexico and Central America , however , they are often used as a meat substitute ; an avocado is rich in protein and contains up to 30 percent of its weight in oil . A Native American The avocado , grown long before the discovery of the New World , is native to Mexico and Central America . Two species are recognized by botanists and horticulturists , and both are now important in commerce . The Guatemalan avocados , Persea americans , are relatively thick-skinned and ripen their fruit mainly in winter and spring . A subgroup of this species , called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall . The Mexican race , P. drymi f olia , has much thinner skinned fruit and is slightly hardier to cold than the Guatemalan and Vest Indian races . AU of the races cross freely , and some of our most valuable avocado varieties appear to be hybrids . Enough varieties have been developed to make mature fruits available practically every month in the year . The avocado was being extensively used by the Aztecs and other natives when the Spaniards arrived . It is today an important part of the native diet where it grows . Tortillas , avocado , and coffee are considered an excellent meal by natives of Mexico and Central America . Aztec picture writings had a sign for the avocado . The early Spanish spelling of the Aztec name was ahuacatl , but many modifications developed . The English name , avocado , is derived from the Spanish modifications of the original Aztec . Before the Europeans came to these shores , avocados were growing in much of Mexico and in northern South America , possibly as far south as Peru . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors recognized the value of the rich , oily , nutritious fruit . Even so , it was slow to be transported to other tropical countries , perhaps because it does not propagate very readily . It was growing in the Hawaiian Islands as early as 1825 , and has since been widely distributed in Africa and Polynesia . There are now plantings in most parts of the world where the climate is suitable . The avocado apparently was not established in the United States until the last century . The first trees of definite record in Florida were brought from Mexico in 1833 by Henry Perrine , a well-known horticulturist , and planted south of Miami . Successful introduction into California was even later . The first recorded planting there was in Santa Barbara in 1871 , also with Mexican trees . The papaya , Carica papaya , or melon tree , is a unique contribution from the Americas . This very large , melonlike fruit is still unfamiliar to most Americans , though it spread quickly to other tropical countries after Columbus reached these shores . Before 1600 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . Its showy , high-quality fruit and its ease of transport and propagation by seed account for its rapid spread ? so rapid that for a time there was question as to whether its original home was America or Africa or India . There still is uncertainty as to whether its native habitat is the West Indian islands or the mainland of Mexico , or both . Its American origin , however , is well established . The papaya grows on a giant herbaceous plant , rather than on a tree . The fruits , which range from a pound up to 20 pounds in size , will mature in about 18 months from the time the seed is planted . In frostfree countries plants will produce for several years . Papaya Juice Makes Tough Meat Tender The papaya also produces an enzyme , papain , which has become an article of commerce . It resembles pepsin in its digestive action and is used for the treatment of certain digestive ailments . Its major use is as a tenderizer of meats . The principal commercial source of papain is India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important tropical fruits . It is used extensively in Hawaii and is of major importance in tropical Asia and Africa . It is grown only in limited quantities in the United States , almost entirely in southern Florida . The heavy , very tender fruit is difficult to ship . The avocado , too , is so tender to frost that areas of production in the continental United States are very limited . Most of our avocados are grown in sections of California south of Los Angeles and near the coast . A second important area is south Florida . Neither avocados nor papayas will tolerate temperatures more than a degree or two below freezing . Avocados can be shipped readily , however , and many an American who never saw an avocado tree is appreciative of this gift from the Aztecs .  | good was no problem , therefore , in distributing those plants , even by the slow sailing ships of the ropics 16th century . sweet , It was not only in tropical countries that 3m the the pineapple created interest .

In large commercial plantags and small gardens , we devote approximately 180,000 acres to growing it . The annual crop has a cash value of more than .3 5,000,000 .

They are also one of the few crops which part-time farmers can easily turn into profits . The plants will grow on soils ranging from d to clay , and in climatic areas from orida into Canada and Alaska . In colder parts of the country , beds must be covered in winter , usually with from one to six inches of straw . Breeding and Cultivation Began Late Although species of strawberry are native in most of the temperate regions of the world , the large-fruited , productive varieties of the present have come from the union of species found in the two Americas . As an important cultivated fruit , the strawberry is a recent addition to world horticulture . Wild strawberries were found over much of Europe from the earliest days , being menned by Virgil ( 70-19 B. C. ) and Pliny the der ( A. D. 23-79 ) . Not until centuries later , wever , is there evidence of cultivation . Berries from the wild were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European ies bore fruit of good quality and were ially notable for their aroma , but the its were small and the plants bore sparmgly . Little improvement in size or yield occurred under cultivation . When the colonists landed in eastern America . they were amazed at the abundance , plant vigor , and fruitfulness of the native strawberry , Fragaria virginiana . " Wee can not sett downe a foote but tred on strawberries , " a colonist from Maryland wrote home to England . This strawberry was taken to France ; the date , as given by Jean Rodin , gardener to Louis XIII , was 1624 . From France it was taken to England and other European countries and was extensively grown in gardens . The berries , even under cultivation , remained small , although of good flavor and much more productive than the old European kinds . The next great event in the history of the strawberry was the introduction of plants from Chile , South America . Long before the white men arrived , the Indians of Chile had cultivated a strawberry better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants bore fruit as large as walnuts . A Frenchman , Captain Frezier , observed these strawberries and took plants to France in 1712 . A few years later , the Chilean berries , F. chiloensis , were taken to England . It seems probable , although direct proof is lacking , that European gardeners in many cases planted the Chilean and the North American kinds in the same gardens . Seedling plants which were crosses of the two kinds originated by chance . Some of these were large-fruited , vigorous , productive plants , the ancestors of our modern varieties . Not until shortly before 1800 , however , were these improved varieties listed by American nurserymen . One of the first of these , a variety from Europe named Pine , but with F. chiloensis in its ancestry , became a parent of many varieties produced in this country . By 1825 , strawberry growing was well established in home gardens , and commercial culture near the larger cities was developing . In 1838 , Charles M. Hovey , a fruit grower , breeder , and writer on horticulture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown from seed produced by cross-pollination . This variety , named the Hovey , not only was a sensational improvement in strawberries but represented , so far as is known , the first fruit variety of any kind originating as a result of definite breeding effort in the United States . It proved a great stimulus to fruit breeding . Improvement Projects Under Way Since the latter half of the 19th century many amateur breeders have crossed and selected strawberries , and the general quality of the varieties has continually improved . In addition , several of the State experiment stations and the U. S. Department of Agriculture have large-scale breeding projects for the improvement of this fruit . Most of the outstanding new varieties of the past 20 years have come from this State and Federal work . Strawberries are grown to some extent in every State in the Union . Largest centers of commercial production are in Louisiana , Tennessee , Arkansas , Oregon , California , North Carolina , and the sections of Maryland , Delaware , and New Jersey east of Chesapeake Bay .

In almost any part of the temperate world , this fruit would probably be either of two closely related kinds , blackberries or raspberries . These two berries , both members of the rose family , have similar histories . Both are : : ative to Asia , Europe , and North America . If raspberries go a little farther north ( to the Arctic ) and south ( to the Equator ) , blackberries are generally more abundant in tern- ; erate regions . Both are quick to spring up in neglected fields , and for many years were more apt to be mowed or plowed under than cultivated . Their very abundance kept them from corn -- .ercial planting and scientific breeding until comparatively late in horticultural history . Raspberries were first mentioned in agricultural writings by the Roman naturalist T : iny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pberries as having come from Mount Ida , Greece . Centuries later the great Swedish , otanist Carolus Linnaeus gave the name Rubus idaeus to the common form of the European red raspberry , because of this early reference to Mount Ida . - An Afternoones Dish to Please the Sicke " The raspberry was mentioned so seldom in early European writings that it is apparent t the fruit was of little importance . Not until 1629 did an English writer more than mention the fruit . In that year a work on - charding devoted a short chapter to rasp-rries . It described red and white kinds , d recommended them for " an afternoones sh to please the taste of the sicke as well the sound . " During the 19th century many varieties of -. igh quality were selected or developed from reeding efforts , particularly in northern European countries . Raspberries there are mainly derived from the native European species , R. idaeus , and many of the varieties are richly flavored . In America early colonists found raspber-:es growing abundantly . Two kinds were common , the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European , and a blackfruited kind , R. occidentalis , now known as ? : -e black raspberry or blackcap raspberry . , m these two American species , and from ; brids with the European species , our cultivated American varieties have been derived . Imo Named varieties appeared in America at about the same time they did in Europe . Several are named in the American Gardener 's *Calendar , published in 1806 , one of the first books published in America dealing especially with gardening and orcharding . Beginning about the middle of the 19th century , great interest developed in America in the breeding of fruits , including raspberries . The most prominent of the raspberry breeders was Dr. William D. Brinckle , a physician who spent most of his life in Philadelphia . Fruit breeding was his avocation , and he introduced several excellent red raspberries . The variety now probably most widely grown , the Latham , was originated by the Minnesota Experiment Station . Blackberries Grow High and Low While blackberries have been divided into hundreds of species , two major kinds occur both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms and the prostrate , or trailing , forms , often called dewberries . How this name originated is uncertain . Perhaps it was because the berries frequently were covered with dew when gathered . The upright blackberries not only have stiff , erect canes but are generally very thorny . They propagate by suckers from the roots . In contrast , the trailing blackberries of America have slender canes , are much less heavily thorned , and do not sucker . The tips of the canes , if in contact with the soil , strike root and establish new plants . In general , the upright forms have a strong flavor , with a somewhat bitter aftertaste . The trailing forms are usually milder flavored . In America blackberries thrive in all except the coldest or driest parts of the country . They are particularly abundant along the eastern seaboard , west to the Plains , and throughout the southern half of the country . Texas is particularly rich in this fruit . Two very high-quality species of dewberries also grow along the Pacific Coast . In Europe blackberry culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in America it started somewhat sooner . In 1850 a bush-type variety , Dorchester , was named in Massachusetts , and remained a valuable variety for nearly half a century . About 1875 a dewberry , the Lucretia , was discovered in West Virginia and transplanted to Ohio . This is still the leading dewberry in more northern latitudes . In recent years , three high-quality trailing types have been widely grown . These are the Youngberry , bred by B. M. Young , a private breeder of Morgan City , Louisiana ; the Loganberry , apparently a cross between the Pacific trailing type and the raspberry , which originated in the garden of Judge J. H. Logan at Santa Cruz , California ; and the Boysenberry , a variety quite similar to Youngberry , of chance origin in California . Unfortunately , all are tender in the colder parts of the country .  | WHEN the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth WHEN Rock , they found a thornless vine growing thick over most of the low , semiswampy areas . On the vines were red berries , unfamiliar and bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians valued these berries highly , both as food ( probably pounded with meat into a paste called " pemmican " ) and as a poultice for blood poisoning . The Indian name for them was I-bimi , " bitter berry . " The colonists , perhaps because the berries were a favorite food of cranes , called them crane-berries , and eventually , cranberries . It would be pleasant to say definitely that the Pilgrims ate cranberries with their turkey and bear meat at the first Thanksgiving dinner , but there is no sure evidence that they did . The record of that feast , contained in a letter believed to have been written by Governor Edward Winslow , tells that four hunters were sent out and killed enough fowl in one day to serve the company for a week . Chief Massasoit and a party of his tribe joined them for three days and added three bears to the larder . Cranberries would have blended admirably with this menu ; the Indians were familiar with them ; and at that season of the year they should have been plentiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Thrive Under Water The American cranberry , Vaccinium macrocarpum , is native from Nova Scotia , Canada , to North Carolina and westward to Wisconsin . It is found mainly in low , swampy sites , particularly those that flood in winter and drain in summer . The coast of Massachusetts , particularly Cape Cod , was a rich center of native cranberries in colonial days ; it still leads in production today . For nearly 200 years the settlers were content to harvest their cranberries from wild vines . This wild crop was a considerable source of revenue on many farms . Early in the 19th century the first attempts were made to transplant and cultivate the fruit . Henry Hall , a veteran of the Revolution , is credited with being the first to try . About 1816 he transplanted wild vines to a swampy site near Dennis that appeared favorable for cranberries . His efforts were apparently successful . In 1832 the local paper printed a story of his work , stating that his grounds averaged about 70 bushels per acre production . Soon other growers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started in New Jersey . Many plantings failed before growers gradually learned the conditions essential for success . They learned that bog areas with peat soil were favorable ; that these should be leveled and the surface layers removed to eliminate weeds ; that they should be well ditched to provide drainage , but should also be built so that they could be flooded during the winter , both to protect the vines from cold and to control insect pests . Thus in the last century cranberry growing has evolved as one of our most intensive and complicated horticultural industries . Expensive preparation is necessary before planting . Practically all bogs are built so that they can be flooded and drained quickly , either by large pumps or by natural flow . Sand is spread over the peat to promote the growth of vines . Problems of insect and disease control must be solved . Vet the industry has grown until about 800,000 barrels are produced in an average year , mainly in Massachusetts , Wisconsin , New Jersey , Washington , and Oregon . Massachusetts is by far the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The earliest plantings were made with unselected wild plants , but soon growers began to choose highly productive plants with especially fine berries . These were propagated and became the basis of the present industry . Modern growers have produced as many as 300 bushels of cranberries on a single acre . Cranberries are picked by hand , or with large , rake-toothed scoops which are pulled through the vines and remove the berries . Since some of the berries are usually bruised , damaged , or decayed , they must be sorted before they are sold . One method , common in earlier times and still used in principle , was to roll the berries down a series of 10 to 30 steps . The good ones , being firm , bounced to the bottom like little rubber balls ; the damaged berries , being soft , stayed on the steps . Machines are now largely used for grading , but even these depend on the ability of the good berries to bounce . Equally Good on the Fourth of July The American cranberry has not become a cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far north of Europe a related , but smaller-sized , fruit is abundant as a native plant , and great quantities are harvested . Neither the European species nor the American is extensively cultivated in Europe . The tradition that helped to give cranberries their start in America has in recent years held the industry back . Growers and canners , producing far more berries and sauce than consumers can possibly eat at Thanksgiving season , have sponsored publicity campaigns to persuade housewives that cranberries are good to eat the year around , not just on one Thursday in November . 71  | WHEN forests are cut or burned away , blueberries are often among the first plants to spring up on the cleared field . Frequently they become the dominant vegetation , providing the landowner with a paying crop that requires little care except for harvesting . If the field is completely neglected , however , taller shrubs and trees soon grow and shade or choke out the blueberries . Thus in New England and other areas where native blueberries are harvested , it is a common sight to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berries quickly spring up again ; the second year after burning a maximum crop will be ready . Some farmers fertilize the fields occasionally and also dust or spray them to control berry worms . On many farms this wild crop is a principal source of income . The blueberry group is probably the most widely distributed fruit in the world . Species of this group are distributed over much of Asia , Europe , and North and South America . They extend from the Tropics to the northern limits of human habitation . They are a valuable addition to the diet of the Eskimos . Although widely distributed and widely used as food , only in the United States and Canada is the blueberry a cultivated , horticultural crop . All of the blueberries grown in North America have been bred from species which are native here . If You Feel the Seeds , It 's a Huckleberry There is great confusion in the common names blueberry and huckleberry . In some areas the names are used interchangeably . The U. S. Department of Agriculture and most botanists and horticulturists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a related group of plants that have 10 rather large bony seeds which are noticeable and somewhat objectionable when the fruit is eaten . Blueberries , on the other hand , have a large number of very small , inconspicuous seeds ? so small that they are not noticed when eating the fruit . Only the blueberries are grown as a horticultural crop . The blueberry thrives only on acid soils . Various species occur over most of the United States and Canada east of the dry prairies . Along the west coast , especially in mountain sites , blueberries also thrive abundantly . The blueberry still is gathered in quantities from the wild . The coastal counties of Maine , the Appalachian plateau from New England to Georgia and Alabama , the Ozarks of Missouri and Arkansas , and the Cascade and Coast Range mountains of the Pacific States are areas where picking and selling wild blueberries is an important industry . Cash value of the annual wild blueberry crop in the United States has been estimated at between $8,000,000 and $10,000,000 . The fruit of at least seven species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important species for native harvest is the lowbush blueberry , Vaccinium angustifolium , the dominant kind from New England west to Minnesota . Second is the high-bush blueberry , V. corymbosum , found throughout the Atlantic Coastal Plain from New England to Georgia , and westward to Lake Michigan . Improvement of blueberries by breeding is the work of the past half-century . Two names stand out in the story of this research . One is Dr. Frederick V. Coville , long a botanist of the U. S. Department of Agriculture ; the other is Miss Elizabeth C. White , a pioneer grower in Whitesbog , New Jersey . Miss White offered cash prizes for the native highbush plants producing the largest fruit , and thus was able to assemble many large-fruited forms . Dr. Coville and Miss White made crosses , starting in 1909 , among these superior plants . The breeding work was continued until Dr. Coville 's death in 1937 . Miss White has continued her research to the present . As a result of this work , 18 varieties having large fruit , attractive color , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These varieties today constitute the extensive cultivated blueberry industry in New Jersey , Michigan , North Carolina , and other States . The fruit of some of them is more than double the size of the largest wild berries . In the far South , the rabbit-eye blueberry , V. ashei , is cultivated on a considerable scale . A number of varieties have been selected from the wild , but only in the past decade has systematic breeding been undertaken . This species is well adapted in the areas within about 300 miles of the Gulf of Mexico . Between 3,000 and 4,000 acres are devoted to growing them in northwestern Florida and near-by States . Mulch Is Best for Growing Because of the exacting requirement of the blueberries as to soil , they are not widely adapted to upland garden culture . They can be grown on many acid soils , particularly if the soil is kept mulched . A heavy mulch of sawdust , oak leaves , or similar material seems to provide the best growing conditions .

Covering the plants before the fruit begins to ripen is about the only way to save the fruit where only a few bushes are grown .  | CURRANTS and gooseberries , spicyflavored berries used in America chiefly for cooking , are prime examples of how fruit can be improved and yields increased by cultivation and breeding . In its wild state , a gooseberry weighs somewhat less than a quarter of an ounce . Under culture , gooseberries have been increased to eight times this size , with individual berries weighing up to two ounces . At an experimental farm in Ottawa , Canada , currant bushes of the Pearl variety have been grown for years with an average yield at the rate of 12,402 pounds per acre . Peak yield has been at the rate of more than 13 tons an acre . Currants and gooseberries , related fruits of the genus Ribes , are native in the colder parts of Europe and North America . While they are planted in many home fruit gardens in the northern half of the United States , they are not nearly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England especially they are grown in great quantities and eaten both as fresh fruit and in jams , pies , and puddings . The European history of these two fruits is very similar . Neither is well adapted to culture in southern Europe , and neither is mentioned in early horticultural writings from the Mediterranean countries . Species from which the cultivated varieties were developed are native over most of Europe , but in southern areas grow only in the high mountains . Thus it was not until agriculture and horticulture developed in northern Europe that these fruits attained any importance . Both currants and gooseberries were first mentioned as garden fruit plants about the time of the discovery of America . References in English writings begin about the middle of the 16th century . At least one German writer described currants in some detail late in the 15th century . Both fruits probably first attained importance in the Low Countries of Europe , particularly the Netherlands . Dried " Currants " Are Really Grapes The name currant is misleading . It apparently derives from the resemblance of the berry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grape long grown for drying . So-called dried " currants " of commerce , to the present time , both in Europe and America , are actually dried grapes of this type , and not really currants at all . The origin of the name gooseberry is less certain . The obvious assumption is that it was once largely served with goose . It seems more probable , however , that the English name is derived from the Dutch name kruisbes , literally , " cross-berry . " The currant was listed with other fruits and crop plants sent to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 . Gooseberries also were sent to the New World then , or shortly thereafter , though we have no specific record of the date . The European currants thrived so well in America that little effort has been made to improve our native kinds , although many species of currants are native here . The white and red varieties commonly grown are derived mainly from the European species Ribes sativum and R. rubrum . The best commercial varieties are probably hybrids of these two species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown in northern Europe , and have long been said to have medicinal value . Recent research has shown that they are extremely rich in vitamin C. They are not grown to any extent in this country . The European gooseberries , R. grossularia , thrive in the United States only in the cool Pacific Coast regions where summers are dry . In the more humid eastern States , the mildew disease attacks the plants of European kinds so severely that culture is difficult . Selections of native American species resistant to the mildew , mainly R. hirtellum , began to appear in American fruit catalogues about a century ago . A little later , varieties that apparently are natural crosses of European varieties and the Americans were selected , and today are the important kinds grown here . They combine the quality of the Europeans with the disease resistance and the heat tolerance found in native kinds . Host to an Enemy of the Pine The white pine blister-rust disease is extremely destructive to the white , or five-needle pine , one of our most valuable forest trees . Species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blister-rust fungus does not spread from pine to pine , but undergoes one stage of its development in the leaves of currants and gooseberries . For this reason , Federal and State Governments have spent millions of dollars to eradicate native Ribes in areas where the white pine is important . For the same reason , planting of currants and gooseberries is prohibited by law in the areas of the country where white pine is of major importance . Where growing these fruits is permitted , they are valuable additions to the home gardens in the northern half of the country . They are little used in this country as fresh fruit ; gooseberries are most often picked for cooking while still green . They are prized by those whose ancestry traces to northern European countries , where these tart , strongly flavored fruits are traditional favorites. 74  | IN the South , small children sometimes dare one another to bite into a green persimmon . The one foolish enough to accept the challenge undergoes a form of torture which can not be adequately described . One sufferer put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's trying to turn itself inside out . It 's not exactly sour , but it 's puckery . " Two species of persimmon are commonly grown in the United States , one native , one imported from the Orient . Most varieties contain measurable quantities of an acid called tannin which , when the fruit is green , produces the mouth-twisting effect for which the persimmon is famous . The Oriental persimmon , Diospyros kaki , is one of the popular fruits of subtropical Oriental countries . Hundreds of varieties are known in the southern islands of Japan and in the south-central part of eastern China . The species is not definitely known in the wild . It evidently originated in the southern part of China , possibly from an amalgamation of native species . That area has been so little explored by western botanists that the origin of the cultivated form is uncertain . The kaki , as it is known in Japan , is a truly subtropical fruit . It is not well adapted in the Tropics , nor will it endure winter temperatures below about 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like native American persimmons , are usually dioecious ? that is , a single tree bears only female , or pistillate , flowers , or only male , or staminate , flowers . Both kinds must be present in a planting for satisfactory fruit production . To Sweeten , Cover and Seal Tightly Some varieties of Oriental persimmons are astringent and puckery until dead ripe , like our native kinds ; others are mild flavored . The tannin which causes the astringency can be rendered tasteless by sealing the fruit in tight containers for several days . In the Orient , the fruit is often placed in tubs from which saki ( rice beer ) has been removed , and the tubs tightly covered . The presence of alcohol was long believed helpful in removing the astringency , but apparently is not necessary . From Japan and China , the Oriental persimmon has gone around the world , but its popularity in other countries has been limited . It reached France early in the past century , but seems not to have arrived in the United States until after Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grafted trees of the better varieties were introduced , largely through the efforts of plant explorers of the United States Department of Agriculture . During the early years ? of the 20th century , there was wide interest in these fruits throughout the southern States , particularly Louisiana and Florida , and in California . In many cases production was poor because of failure to provide pollinating trees . Also , in spite of its good qualities , the fruit was unknown on American markets and did not find a ready demand . The abundance of fruits on our markets makes the introduction of a new and little-known kind difficult . Today persimmons enjoy a steady but moderate sale . Through a large area of the South they are especially valuable for home gardens and local markets . The trees bloom very late , and blossoms are rarely destroyed by spring frosts . The American persimmon , D. virginiana , is a fairly abundant tree throughout the southeast quarter of the country . It occurs most frequently from central Kansas and Nebraska eastward to Maryland , Virginia , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as southern New England and Michigan . " Delicious as an Apricock " The native persimmon impressed early explorers and settlers as a promising and valuable fruit . Capt . John Smith wrote soon after settling at Jamestown : " Plumbs there are of 3 sorts . The red and white are like our hedge plumbs : but the other which they call Putchamis grow as high as a palmeta . The fruit is like a medlar ; it is first green , then yellow and red when it is ripe : if it is not ripe it will drive a mans mouth awrie with much torment ; but when it is ripe , it is as delicious as an apricock . " Even more than the Orientals , the native persimmon must be dead ripe to be eaten without causing puckering . Only sporadic attempts have been made to improve the native persimmon . Trees bearing superior fruit have been selected from the wild . During the 19th century , a good many gardeners collected persimmon trees ; the poet William Cullen Bryant was an ardent persimmon enthusiast . Improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wild trees . The work that has been done in breeding blueberries indicates what could be accomplished by similar work with the persimmon . If the native variety could be successfully crossed with the Oriental , the possibilities of improvement would be enormous . In the meantime , persimmon lovers will continue to seek out native trees in the late fall , shake down the dead-ripe fruit , and eat it out of hand or take it home for the preparation of persimmon pudding , persimmon cake , or other culinary delights .
