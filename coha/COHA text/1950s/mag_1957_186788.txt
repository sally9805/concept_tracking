" If you want to be taken for a San Franciscan , " advises a new San Francisco guidebook , " dress conservatively , cling to the outside of cable cars , and make bad jokes about Los Angeles . " Though Guidebook Author Herb Caen does not mention it , another sure sign of the Compleat San Franciscan is his addiction to the San Francisco Examiner 's Columnist Herb Caen . <P> Newsman Caen ( rhymes with rain ) is probably the most loyally read local columnist in the U.S. , and his formula-like San Francisco-is unique . " My job , " says he , " is to make the legends come true . ' While 15 other local columnists in the city 's four dailies have come and gone in the past two decades , Caen 's lighthearted legend-doctoring has filled six newspaper columns a week since 1938 , earned him the sobriquet " Mr. San Francisco . " and poured over into five profitable books about the city he calls Baghdad-by-the-Bay . The latest , Herb Caen 's Guide to San Francisco , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few local guidebooks in publishing history to have made the national bestseller list . <P> Topic A. Caen 's Baghdad is essentially a mutual admiration society whose members never tire of hearing San Francisco 's praises sung . " You go ten days without writing a column about how great the city is , " says Caen , " and you start getting letters saying ' you do n't love us any more .

He even manages to extol such dubious assets as the city 's sky-high alcoholism rate and the fleas , which , according to Caen , " bite only tourists and newcomers " because the natives are " so full of garlic . " At times , Garlic Lover Caen sounds as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Picturesque Speech Department . Sample : " The sidewalk flower stands exuding such clouds of heavy perfume that their owners should be arrested for fragrancy . " <P> " Babble-by-the-Bay . " What saves his column from being a paean in the neck is Caen 's fresh , irreverent eye and his breezy , gag-filled style . Unlike most gossip columnists , Herb Caen seldom rumples through dirty linen or tries to scoop the city desk , but concentrates instead on the San Franciscana he calls " sightems " or " babble-by-the-bay . " Sample Caenanities : " Sign on a Volkswagen : Help Stamp Out Cads " ; classified ad for a new home : " All-electric family kitchen , including natural-birth cabinets " ; one matron to another matron : " No , she 's not keeping the car any more . Just the chauffeur. "
