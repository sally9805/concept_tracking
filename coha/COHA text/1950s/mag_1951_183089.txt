The warmly sentimental , eternally commercial heart of show business throbbed for a full hour this week on an NBC-TV show called America Applauds ; An Evening for Richard Rodgers . Out of friendship for Composer Rodgers ( and , incidentally , to plug the women 's shoes made by Sponsor U.S. Shoe Corp . ) , Mary Martin made her first TV appearance , accompanied by Rodgers at the piano , and singing I 'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy . Bing Crosby crooned It 's Easy to Remember from Rodgers ' 1935 movie Mississippi , Valerie Bettis danced the Slaughter on Tenth Avenue ballet from 1936 's On Your Toes . Other singers and dancers ran through assorted Rodgers numbers dating from his 1925 Garrick Gaieties to his current South Pacific . <P> The sponsored public tribute to Composer Rodgers was the idea of Producer Henry Souvaine , who rounded up the stars and then sold the package to advertiser and network . Its announced purpose : to celebrate Rodgers ' 25 years in the theater . Another advertiser , Philco , got into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 25 U.S. veterans ' hospitals . <P> Souvaine , apparently more interested in sentiment than mathematics , shrugs aside the fact that Rodgers ' first Broadway show ( A Lonely Romeo ) was produced 32 years ago ; his first hit ( Garrick Gaieties ) , 26 years ago . <P> Producer Souvaine sees a great future in tributes to other talented artists , is currently planning TV testimonials to Oscar Hammerstein II and Cole Porter . In a day of rising costs , personal tributes have the compelling attraction of bargain rates : " On this show we 've got about $60,000 worth of talent , but , naturally , we 're not paying anything like that-the stars are getting practically nothing . " Souvaine adds : " Richard Rodgers is very much touched . "
