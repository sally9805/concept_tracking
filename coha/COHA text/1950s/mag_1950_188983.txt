" Remember the ladies , " Abigail Adams wrote to her husband when he went off to help write the Declaration of Independence . " If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies , we are determined to foment a rebellion . " John Adams and the other signers did pretty much forget the ladies-but the ladies did not forget . Last week the sound of rebellion trilled across Capitol Hill . With banners flying , the not-to-be-forgotten sisters of Abigail Adams were on the march . <P> The nub of their demands was that women 's suffrage was not enough . They demanded a constitutional amendment which declared : " Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex . " The battle was joined when Iowa 's earnest , white-haired Guy Gillette introduced the amendment on the floor of the Senate . <P> With Every Weapon . The ladies-moving spirit was an invincible feminist , wan , whisperingly insistent , 65-year-old Alice Paul . During World War I , she had been thrown into jail for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she declined to eat . She helped found the National Woman 's Party . She was the spiritual sister of Abigail Adams , of Amelia Jenks Bloomer , the first bloomer girl , of those heroines of women 's rights-Susan B. Anthony , Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott-before whose statue in the crypt of the Capitol she had posed , tight-lipped and purposeful . <P> Behind her and the proposed 22nd Amendment were Bess Truman , Perle Mesta , women 's organizations by the score-her own National Woman 's Party , the General Federation of Women 's Clubs , the ' American Medical Women 's Association , the Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic , the National Association of Colored Women . Miss Paul and her cohorts rapped on Senate doors , buttonholed Senators . Their weapons were whatever came to hand-documents , dialectics , plain talk and implied political threats . Some , like Ernestine Bellamy , distant relative of Edward ( Looking Backward ) Bellamy , splendidly flashed the most invincible feminine weapon of all ( see cut ) . <P> Are n't Women Persons ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to relegate women to the class of chattel . As the redoubtable Mrs. Emma Guffey Miller , sister of ex-Senator Joe Guffey , had pointed out during earlier Senate committee hearings : " We women want to be persons now because we are still not persons in the Constitution . " <P> They argued that in some states women were not allowed to serve on juries , or to run a business and keep the profits without their husbands ' consent . In some states a husband might get a divorce from an unfaithful wife but not vice versa . In some states women might not handle baggage , mix strong drinks in public places , work in blast furnaces , bowling alleys or shoeshine parlors . It was not a question of whether they wanted to do these things ; they just resented the implication of inferiority . The proposed amendment would wipe out all such strictures at one stroke .
