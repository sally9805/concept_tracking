Sophomore Tailback John L. Sullivan took over when Dan Sachs was lugged off with a back injury , sparked Princeton to three touchdowns before he , too , limped off . // Columbia , badly battered in 10 straight losses , finally emerged from the depths to upset Yale 13-0 after Guard Gene Appel found himself in possession of an errant Eli pass and carried it back 65 yards for a touchdown . Harvard , cheerless so far this year , uncovered Charlie Ravenel , a slick little sophomore quarterback , who led the Cantabs to a 20-0 win over favored Lehigh. // Rutgers , hardly looking itself for two periods while Richmond 's Spiders spun a neat web around the Scarlet attack , was inspired by Tailback Billy Austin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustered enough power to win 23-12 and remain among the East 's unbeaten . Syracuse dipped down into the fourth and fifth strings in an attempt to hold down the score , but still thrashed inept Cornell 55-0 . The top three : // 1 . ARMY ( 3-0 ) 2 . NAVY ( 3-0 ) 3 . PITT ( 3-1 ) // THE SOUTH // LSU , a scant pregame favorite , used big-gun Halfback Billy Cannon as a decoy , sent the rest of its high-speed backfield against a porous Miami line to ring up the South 's surprise of the week 41-0 . The unbeaten Tigers , certain of their running game , have now developed a quick-as-a-cat line and capable passing , are suddenly a factor in the SEC. // Auburn , tipped off to Kentucky 's leaky pass defense , added an aerial barrage to its wonderfully consistent defense and rumbled past the Wildcats 8-0 . Quarterback Lloyd Nix did most of the Auburn pitching , lobbing the big one to Halfback Jimmy Laster , who sprinted 43 yards for a fourth-period touchdown. // Turning loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bad breaks to dump the Greenies 19-8 and remain unbeaten . Tulane lost a chance for a final , spectacular score in the last period when Quarterback Richie Petitbon , returning a kickoff , slipped and fell in the clear on the Mississippi 14-yard line . // Clemson failed on a two-point conversion when trailing Vanderbilt by a point , but pulled out a 12-7 thriller on Quarterback Harvey White 's desperate dive into the end zone with nine seconds to play . // Playing the kicking game for all it was worth , Georgia Tech used a 14-yard field goal by Tommy Wells and a 74-yard punt return by Frank Nix to go ahead 9-0 , and a 72-yard quick kick by Joe DeLany to stay there , in a 21-7 victory over Tennessee . // In other games , Texas A&amp;M drove 88 yards to push ahead 14-10 in the third quarter , had no trouble holding off fizzling Maryland for the rest of the game ; North Carolina punched out a second-quarter touchdown and then sat on it to beat South Carolina 6-0 ; Wake Forest kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heap , beating North Carolina State 's defending champions 13-7 ; Duke overcame Baylor 12-7 ; West Virginia huffed and puffed through a 22-point last period , but it was n't quite good enough to catch Boston U. , a 36-30 winner ; Georgia , getting off its back after a shaky start , beat Florida State 28-13 . The top three : // 1 . AUBURN ( 3-0 ) 2 . MISSISSIPPI ( 4-0 ) 3 . CLEMSON ( 4-0 ) // THE SOUTHWEST // Texas , smelling upset blood after three periods of hard-nose football with Oklahoma , called on sub Quarterback Vince Matthews ( see page 8 ) to lend an arm in the last quarter , got just the pickup it needed when he completed six out of seven passes to bring the Longhorns to the Sooner seven-yard line . In came regular Quarterback Bobby Lackey , who aimed a jump pass over the middle to End Bob Bryant to tie the score at 14-14 , then calmly kicked the extra point to lower the boom on prestige-heavy Oklahoma 15-14 ( see page 14 ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas jumping . // With Southwest Conference action still in the embryonic stage , Rice found a sparkplug in sophomore Quarterback Alvin Hartman , who scored once and passed 36 yards for another touchdown , bringing the Owls a 24-0 victory over Arkansas and a share in the SWC lead with TCU and Baylor. // TCU 's Marvin Lasater , an unhappy young man while floundering in his team 's first three games , suddenly found himself , scored one touchdown and set up two others to help beat Texas Tech 26-0. // Colorado , with one eye focused on the still-distant game with Oklahoma , thumped Arizona 65-12 as Howard Cook , an able successor to All-America Bob Stransky , ran for four touchdowns . The top three : // 1 . TEXAS ( 4-0 ) 2 . TCU ( 3-1 ) 3 . SMU ( 1-2 ) // THE MIDWEST // Eastern football , long considered second-rate in comparison with midwestern standards , moved up in stature but it took the armed forces to turn the trick . // Army , exploiting greater speed and unbounded enthusiasm , sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tackles , gave ground on defense only when it did n't matter to beat dogged , unspectacular Notre Dame 14-2. // Navy wound up on the short end of the statistics but on the long end of a 20-14 score against favored Michigan . Quarterback Joe Tranchini ( see left ) , as elusive as a cockroach on a kitchen floor , passed the Wolverines dizzy , tossing 37 yards to End Dick Zembrzuski for the winning touchdown with five minutes to play . // Pitt , another eastern power , was not quite so fortunate , bowing 22-8 to Michigan State 's superior manpower and heft . State hugged the ground , threw only nine passes . Observed Spartan Coach Duffy Daugherty facetiously : " We do n't need more passing , just more completions. " // Outweighed 30 pounds per man but not outgamed , spirited Illinois jammed up the inside , forced Ohio State to run outside , gave Coach Woody Hayes food for thought before his Buckeyes wore down the Illini 19-13. // Dark horse Wisconsin moved alongside Ohio State , Northwestern and Iowa in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roll to an easy 31-6 victory . Brash young Northwestern , with Sophomore Quarterback Dick Thornton see below ) showing the way , stormed 59 yards in the final minutes to edge Minnesota 7-3 , while Iowa hit defenseless Indiana hard and often to win 34-13. // Missouri found prosperity hard to take and blew a 19-point lead before losing to SMU 32-19 . The top three : // 1 . OHIO STATE ( 3-0 ) 2 . WISCONSIN ( 3-0 ) 3 . MICHIGAN STATE ( 2-0-1 ) // THE WEST // Oregon found an offense named Willie West , who romped 66 yards in the opening minutes , to match its air-tight defense and bulled past USC 25-0 into first place in the PCC . // Coach Jack Curtice , who has long claimed that football was for fun and laughs but has had little occasion for either since he arrived at Stanford , was beginning to chuckle again after his thrice-trounced Indians beat Washington 22-12. // California 's Joe Kapp put on another dazzling show for the home folks with his ball handling and passing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were licking their wounds after tilts with outsiders . Wyoming , the class of the Skyline Conference , gave a 28-0 thumping to lackluster Oregon State ; although UCLA End Dick Wallen snared 10 of Tailback Don Long 's passes , Florida beat the disorganized Bruins 21-14. // COP 's Dick Bass was at it again ( see page 75 ) , battering and slithering his way to one touchdown and 135 yards in less than half a game as the undefeated Tigers routed Brigham Young 26-8. // Equally at home on the ground and in the air , the Air Force kept its string going , zooming past Colorado State 36-6 . The top three : // 1 . COLLEGE OF PACIFIC ( 3-0 ) 2 . OREGON STATE ( 2-2 ) 3 . AIR FORCE ( 2-0-1 )
