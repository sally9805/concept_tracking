With high hopes , Allen Moye , 39 , a hard-scrabbling cotton planter and hog raiser , gave rights to Humble Oil &; Refining Co. to drill a wildcat well on his 100-acre farm , just five miles above the Florida line , near Pollard , Ala . He knew the odds were long even though Humble , one of the biggest wildcat gamblers in the U.S. , was doing the drilling . For 18 days , Moye , his wife and four children watched as the Humble bits sank a full mile below the cotton fields without striking anything . Then , under the glare of the night lights , at 5,945 ft. , the drills came up smudged black with oil . Next morning , a gusher shot 100 ft. into the air , the first flowing well in Alabama 's history . <P> At the news last week , oilmen from five states made a beeline for Pollard , looked at their reflections in the pool of oil ( see cut ) , and frantically began bidding for leases . Overnight , leases shot up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50 . On the New York Stock Exchange , St. Regis Paper Co. , which owns some nearby land , became the heaviest-traded stock , gained more than two points . Gulf and Standard of Indiana , which own leases near by , got ready to sink wells of their own . " The well blew its top , " said Alabama 's state geologist , Dr. Walter B. Jones , " and all the oil people blew their tops . " <P> Christmas in January . The Moye well is already producing 300 bbls. a day of good-quality crude , and some oilmen think that it can yield 1,000 bbls . With his one-eighth royalty , Farmer Moye , who paid off his mortgage only last September , could count on an income of perhaps $25,000 to $30,000 a year . <P> If it seemed like a belated Christmas to Moye , it was all in the day 's work for Humble 's 58-year-old , lawyer-trained President Hines Holt Baker of Houston . In the blue-chip game of oil , gambling on wildcats is part of his business . Wildcatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude oil , and more than doubled its output in a decade ( from 49 million bbls. in 1940 to 103 million in 1950 ) . It also helped Humble boost its net profit by 66% in 1951 's first half , the latest report it has issued . <P> Humble is 72.4% owned by Standard Oil Co . ( NJ. ) , and is its biggest U.S. subsidiary , but Baker runs it , from the Humble Building in Houston , pretty much like a sovereignty , looks on the parent company much as Texas looks on the rest of the U.S. <P> The Cost of Wildcats . In the nearly four years that Baker has been president , Humble has spent an estimated $215 million on speculative digging , plans to spend another $70 million this year , drill some 800 wells . Humble went into Alabama after Dallas ' Hunt Oil Co. struck the first oil there in 1944-the Gilbertown field , 80 miles north of Mobile , which now has 69 producing wells . Humble opened the second field , the Carlton , some 55 miles northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all these , the oil must be pumped up , usually the sign of a small field . But when Humble 's Allen Moye No. 1 Well came in under its own pressure , oilmen quickly changed their minds , now think that Alabama may become a big producer .
