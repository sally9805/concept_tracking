Grey and leaden skies hung over most of West Germany on election day , but there was no rain . In the north , in Hamburg and Bremen , a warm summer sun shone brightly as voters trooped to the polls clad in their Sunday best . North Sea excursion-boat operators dutifully changed their schedules to accommodate the voters . Far to the south at Berchtesgaden , a loyal supporter of Christian Democrat Konrad Adenauer closed down his ski lift all morning so that no votes would be lost on the Alps . In the beer-toping Bavarian capital of Munich , police recorded one brain concussion and two broken ribs in election-eve brawls . <P> But that was about all . Even the climaxes of the closing week seemed to do nothing to stir the long-foregone conclusion that Adenauer &; Co. would win easily . Communist agents from East Germany brought in a last batch of pamphlets depicting Adenauer clad in a Nazi uniform . The Socialists tried vainly to whip up anti-Adenauer sentiments by calling him Atomkanzler . <P> Unsolicited Help . They also got some unsolicited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In his chase for the vote , Adenauer tries to hide from the German people his policy of militarization and of atomic armament . " While the Socialists indignantly rejected Gromyko 's support , Adenauer contented himself with I-told-you-so , told his audiences that Socialist Leader Ollenhauer was just playing Little Red Riding Hood to Khrushchev 's Big Bad Wolf . <P> Octogenarian Adenauer himself observed election day first by attending St. Mary 's church in Rhndorf , where his son Paul officiated at Mass . The day 's sermon included the reading of a papal message urging all to vote on pain of committing mortal sin . To the Pope 's message , Father Heinrich Lemmen added one of his own , a thinly veiled swat at the Socialists : " When one recalls that two-fifths of the present Bundestag do not believe in God , one can only say ' God save us . ' " <P> On the Venusberg , a hill in suburban Bonn , amiable little Socialist Erich Ollenhauer hiked a block and a half over a mud path to the polling station to cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ollenhauer cheerfully . " Why not ? " He grinned , and in a quiet near-acknowledgment of his impending defeat , added : " But maybe the sky is not on my side . " <P> It was n't . Dry weather has traditionally favored the CDU , bringing out the contented middle class that might otherwise stay home . By the time that returns were in this week , Konrad Adenauer and his party had won in a landslide . Ollenhauer and the Socialists ran a poor second . Some splinter parties , like Reinhold Maier 's Free Democrats , scraped through , but only with minimal representation . Twelve years after the defeat of World War II , West Germany was well on its way to a working , two-party , democratic system . For 81-year-old Konrad Adenauer , the Christian Democratic sweep meant a third term with an even larger personal electoral victory than he rolled up in 1953.
