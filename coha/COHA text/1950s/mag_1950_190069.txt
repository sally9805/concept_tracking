In postwar Germany , husky , bull-necked Master Sergeant John C. Woods of San Antonio had gone about his business with a craftsman 's pride and enthusiasm . As official U.S. hangman , he credited himself with more than 300 successful executions , topped off his career four years ago by hanging ten of the Nazi leaders condemned in the Nrnberg trials . " Never saw a hanging go off any better , " he said cheerfully afterwards . He was not disturbed when bald , squat Julius Streicher , the Jew baiter , had snarled at him : " The Bolsheviks will hang you , too , some day . " <P> But , as time went by , Hangman Woods was more &; more disturbed by the way the German people began to look at him . He took to packing two .45s , remarked loudly , " If some German thinks he wants to get me , he better make sure he does it with his first shot , because I was raised with a pistol in my hand . " Once , just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was certain the German cooks had poisoned him . He was delighted when the Army returned him to the U.S. , felt better still last March when it shipped him half a world away from Germany , to duty on Eniwetok Atoll in the mid-Pacific . <P> There , the Army reported tersely last week , Hangman Woods died . Cause of death : accidental electrocution.
