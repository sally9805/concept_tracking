New approaches to the control of a variety of diseases , using chemical variants of the body 's natural hormones , were reported last week by research teams from Manhattan 's Sloan-Kettering Institute . <P> Trickiest of the hormones has been the one secreted by the pituitary gland , which stimulates growth . Overproduction in childhood makes a giant . In the adult it can cause acromegaly ( a localized form of gigantism , with enlargement of the jaw and extremities ) , can also aggravate diabetes and may speed the spread of cancer originating in the breast . Hitherto , the only way to halt the effects of growth hormone was to destroy the pituitary by radiation or surgery ( TIME , May 16 , 1955 ) . But Drs . Martin Sonenberg and William Money described a new gimmick that has worked in animals : they treat growth hormone ( from cattle ) with acetic anhydride , inject the resulting acetylated compound into rats . It appears to be taken up by the animals ' systems in a way that blocks the effects of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , but the researchers are trying to get human growth hormone and treat it the same way . <P> There was no such animal-human barrier in the work of team members headed by Dr. Leon Hellman . They were dealing with the breakdown products of natural human hormones as they go through the metabolic cycle . From the breakdown of testosterone and related hormones the researchers found two potent derivatives : androsterone and etiocholanolone , with properties different from those of their parent substances . Example : androsterone lowers the level of circulating cholesterol ( though testosterone may raise it ) , may thus be useful in combating atherosclerosis and reducing the danger of heart attacks and many strokes ; etiocholanolone triggers a rise in body temperature , may be involved in mysterious fevers and some rheumatic diseases . <P> Equally surprising was the finding that the body 's output and metabolism of these substances depend on how well the thyroid gland is functioning . This close relationship between two supposedly distinct systems had not been suspected . A significant item : the body 's output of androsterone declines with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in old age , and suggests a clue to ways of slowing them down .
