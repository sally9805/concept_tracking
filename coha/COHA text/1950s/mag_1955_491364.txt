right . The beef was much better than the entree I ordered . Projecting a song is not a thing you can take apart and study . I do n't bother about style , but when I sing I have a whirlwind drive . I do n't think anyone in the business can top me at that . I ask you : Have you ever seen a good imitation of me ? That 's what I thought . Buck Crouse and Howard Lindsay , the authors of Call Me Madam , wrote a line for the program of that show- " The character played by Miss Merman has no resemblance to anybody , living or dead . " I thought it was an amusing take-off on the usual guff about how any resemblance to a real person is purely coincidental . I 'm not a girl who has to move her lips to get the meaning of a tabloid headline . I 'm not a hookworm either . But I know this much : The character you put down on paper for an audience that reads your stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coincidental resemblance to real life . The way I see it , if you 're telling the story of your life , making people understand the lyrics is the big thing . So if I make this loud , brassy and honest , the way I did when I sang I Got Rhythm ; Eadie Was a Lady ; Anything Goes ; I Get a Kick Out of You , it ought to go over . I 'm not worried about the honest part . That 's no trick . My former husband , Bob Levitt , can tell you about that side of me . Once , when somebody was trying to think of a title for a movie I was to he in , Levitt said , " No problem . Tactless Tillie Strikes Again . " During World War II , Levitt was an aide to a general call General W. , because his last name does n't start with that initial . One Sunday afternoon , kicking and complaining , I was dragged to an Army cocktail hoedown with Levitt . General W. had told my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wife to any of these things , Levitt , " he said , huffing and pulling . " Why not , Levitt ? " It was Levitt'a job to follow the Old Man around and make sure that he did n't trip over his shoelaces or lose his shoulder stars or anyl hing . The party was so military you mentally stood at attention all the time , and I found myself up to my eyeballs in Army wives and stuff . There were about 100 people clanking around , and they could n't have been less my kind . I did n't know anybody , and what with all the yaketying , T did n't find out which of the fifty dames there was Mrs. General W. The drinks they were serving were warm Manhattans , and while I 'd never had a Manhattan in my life  --  in fact , I hated them  --  I thought if I sloshed enough of them down they might dull my senses . There was no choice  --  either warm Manhattans or just smiling and showing my teeth . After the cocktail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tied on the feed bag . During dinner the band played , and a lady came up to me and said , " Would you mind getting up and singing a few songs ? " I looked at her , wondering , Who put you in charge , honey ! and said , " Get out of my way , Cuddles , or I 'll spit in your eye . " When Levitt told me later , " You said it as if you meant it ! " I gave him a clue . I did mean it . Guess who she was ? You 've got it ? the general 's wife . If they 'd had K.P . for officers , Levitt would have drawn onion peeling . Anyhow , there was no more urging me to sing . But the general 's wife turned out to be a nice little woman who thought me funny . She smiled at , the other ladies , and her smile said , " Are n't show people quaint ' ? " And they all smiled dutifully because the general 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army did n't mix . Army wives have to know protocol , when to be nice to the general 's Frau  --  that kind of junk . Also a lot of the people you ran into at those service shindigs were squares . Levitt t the dogi used to say that he 'd made arrangements for me to pour at the Officers ' Club teas . I was petrified until he let me up off the floor . Quite a sense of humor , Levitt had . He could mix with any group , it was all the same to him , but when I had to listen to that Army-wife lingo , 1 goofed . They talked about where they 'd been stationed and what they did when they were stationed there . Not for me , sister ! So whenever anything happened that gave little Ethel a chance to louse up protocol and Levitt 's chances for a step up in rank , I was home free . The following little horror story of Ethel Levitt as daddy 's helper will show that . It took place when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rummy  --  not gin , but the old-fashioned kind where you pick up the whole deck and hold about 300 cards in your hand . " This is the only kind of rummy I play , " he told us . " And I never lose at t his game . " he added grimly . " Never . I 'm very fortunate . " Levitt gave me a long , slow , warning glare to make sure that I got it and would do the diplomatic thing . But somehow I missed locking looks with him and I did n't get the word . I murdered the general at his own Stone Age game caper . I took every round from him . He was so mad he got up and stamped around until I felt like saying , ' ' Stop with the road work , general ! " then he stamped out , mumbling something about being " damned if I 'm going to play with a female cutthroat . " Levitt swore he said " hell cat " instead of " cutthroat . " Anyhow , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was afraid he 'd have a stroke , so I was happy when he said whatever he said and blew . But while I may have been the dope of I he world at the old Army game , I did all right at entertaining the boys at the camps . I liked to go to the staging areas most of all . I thought that those were the most important places to entertain , because sometimes , after you 'd gone there and entertained the boys , they 'd march out of the hall onto the hull train , headed for the war , and that was the last entertainment they had . Not to patty-cake around with it , it was the last entertainment some of them ever had . So I concentrated on them . I kept on concentrating after I got pregnant with baby Bob , who was born in 1945 . The maternity dresses the girls wore then had elastic around the waist , and as you got bigger , they stretched . I have n't worn one since , so I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand they have big round holes cut in the front of the skirts they wear under smocks , and you have to be careful not to put your knees through them . The Army at age hands and electricians got a kick out of lighting me . They knew I was from the theater and that I knew good lighting when it hit me in the face . So they lit me beautifully , with a special sort of off-pink spot they knew I liked . But , as I grew bigger and bigger , the spotlight got smaller and smaller . When I was at Camp Shanks , a month before the baby was born , they had a spot just on my face . I was blacked out from the chin down . I will say this : Whether honesty is the best policy or not , I 'm more honest about myself than some of those who 've written about me . Every celebrity gets slugged over the head with stuff somebody has dreamed up to pad out a story . I 've seen it . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naive that . I applied for a passport to get to New York from Astoria . I 've never been that dumb , even when I was young . They used to kid me about Astoria ? I did n't move to New York until 1933 , when I moved there with my parents  --  and about how I lived " in another country . " I may have said , " O.K. , I 'll get a passport so I can get . to New York . " But if I did , naturally I did n't mean it . It was for laughs . And I 've been quoted as saying about Mary Martin : " She 's all right if you like talent . " It'sa great . crack , and I wish I had said that one . Then there was the time when I was in Annie Get Your Gun that a New York columnist started the darling little rumor over town that I was pregnant . It could have ruined the show . If we had n't hada million-dollar advance sale when this was printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been out of work . This rumor became the plague of my life . My obstetrician was even calling me up to check , until I told him , " Do n't call me . I 'll call you . " Even after the rumor had been corrected  --  but not by the columnist who started it ? people kept calling the box office to say . " I have tickets for such and such a date . " iThey 'd name a date three or four months away . ) " Do you suppose Miss Merman will still be in t he show t hen I 've waited so long to see it . I 'd hate to turn my tickets in now . " The report that I was expecting a child cropped up at intervals for thirty months . If it had been true , it would have been the oldest baby ever born . Uni not the self-conscious type , but it began to get me down , to have people everywhere I went look at my midsection before they looked at my face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your information ? " I was informed , " Someone in your cast told me . " Until then , I 'd wondered why it had n't been checked , but after that I stopped wondering . Of course , anyone in the cast would know more about such a matter than I would . Bob Levitt would have told this columnist the truth if he had been asked . He was always honest about such things . I got a boot out of a remark of his I read somewhere , " I like Ethel best of all when she 's pregnant . " It was a wonderful crack . When you first heard it you wondered what he meant . It could have meant anything , but what he really meant was that when I was expecting , I was sweet and cheerful , and nothing bothered me . Looking forward to a baby coming made me that way . And anot her thing , we stayed home and we did n't go out as much then , because when I got pregnant I did n't fool around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both children were Caesarean births ; so I would n't call either little Bobby or little Ethel II hard , tough pregnancy . But with both children I grew enormous in a big way . Along about the third month , I felt that I was pregnant all over . Although I 'm not married to Levitt any longer ? I 'll go into the reasons why I 'm not , later  --  we certainly started out on a note of honesty . Not diplomacy , just honesty . The two are n't necessarily the same . 1 first met Levitt through friends at Dint . y Moore 's after the theater . The friends were Walter Young , who was then an executive of the New York Journal American , but who 's no longer with the paper ; and his wife , Ella . Levitt was with them . I had never set eyes on him before . For that matter , he 'd never seen me before either , even on the stage . He never went to musical comedies , He did n't like them . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go borne early because of a matinee the next day . Although Levitt had n't talked to me much during the evening , Walter asked him to take me home . He broke down and talked a little on the way , but it was n't what you 'd call inspiring . There was a snowstorm , but we 'd managed to grab a taxicab , and when we pulled up in front of 25 Central Park West , where I lived , the snow was piled high on the curb . I naturally expected the man with me to get out and help me to the sidewalk , but he made no move to get out of the cab . " Well ? " I said . " This is n't love , " he said ; " this is just friendship . " " If I never see you again , it will be too soon , " I said , to give a ladylike translation to what I really told him . So I got out and plowed through the snow by myself . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth **25;34;TOOLONG thing . For all Levitt cared , I could have got out on my hands and knees . Even before that , he had indicated that he was n't the soft , yielding type . I 'd asked him for a piece of chewing gum , but he 'd made no move to buy me a pack . I think it was the day after the big snow scene that he sent me a whole carton of gum , Then , two or three nights later , the Youngs called me again . They were at Toots Shor 's . Levitt was with them , and they wanted me to join them . I would n't . II . wee my turn to play hard to get . " Nothing doing , that 's all , " I said . He was n't going to win me over with any stale old carton of chewing gum . However , he kept trying , and finally we stepped out . formal to El Morocco , both of us guesied up in evening clothes . After that , I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levitt approach to being drenched with buckets of sweetness and light . I never know where I 'm at with people who are too gracious . One St. Patrick 's night I was on a double date with Eleanor Holm ? I remember we had green carnations in our hair  --  when Lady Sylvia Ashley came along and gave me a big , gooey hello . Although I 've figured since thatahe was only being gracious and courteous tome . " Oh , Miss Merman , " she said , " I 've never had the pleasure of meeting you , but you 're a great. , great artist . Why , you 're simply delightful . " I do n't go for that la-de-dah stuff . I do n't care a hoot whether you tell me I stink or tell me I 'm good , as long as I 'm sure you 're leveling with me . When I 'm in any doubt , my policy is mow ' em down . So I looked her straight in the face and said , " Thank you , Mary Pickford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of humor mixed with his forthrightness . Which brings me to a story I want to work in here about the Duchess of Windsor  --  and a steak tartare , which is the Social Register name for a raw hamburger . We 'd been at a party somewhere , but had left early . It was when the Duke was writing his book , so he was home writing it , and there were Russell Nype , and Wally , some other man , whose name 1 forget , and I. Being taken suddenly hungry , we dropped into the Cub Room at the Stork Club , and I ordered a steaktartare sandwich . I love them . I eat them by the pound . I do n't like them all sissied up with those anchovies and stuff they load on if you do n't tell them not to . Just give me the raw meat . " Girl , what did you order ? " Wally asked me . She always calls me " girl . " " Raw meat , " I said . " Bring a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never had any . I 'm terribly curious . " So a whole big thing of raw meat was lugged in , She wolfed it down and thought it , wonderful . I guess it 's not important , Ind it seemed so incongruous . I mean , after all this is a woman who inspired a king to give up his throne because of her loveliness . Well , u raw-meat Sandwich is not exactly the kind of thing you 'd think she 'd go for , is it ? Anyhow , mentioning the Duchess leads into Levitt 's crack about the Duke 's humming . When you 're talking to him , t he Duke keeps going , " H'm'm 'm , " between remarks . Maybe it 's a nervous tic of the voice or something . I would n't know . But he does hum . I remember asking Levitt , " What 's with that noise that comes out of the Duke while you 're talking to him ? Why do you suppose he does it ? " Levitt gave it some thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waldorf is DC and the Duke is AC . " I thought it was a very funny remark . If you 've ever tried to plug an alternating-current electrical cord into a direct-current outlet , you 'll know what he meant . If you have n't , just skip it . Speaking of diplomacy , there are certain types who 're always getting up impromptu competit ions to prove they know more lyrics of bygone pop songs than anybody else . More and more people seem to be doing this nowadays , particularly with old songs being revived all the time , such as Les Paul and Mary Ford 's rendition of In the Good Old Summertime . It happens that I know a number of old lyrics too . I 've made it my business to , so , when I go to parties and someone it down and plays them , I can sing . And I sing them in spite of the jerks who look at me like I 'm Dame Sybil Thorndyke , or a lady spy in the Civil War , or something equally mossy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " One night when a " gentleman " ? I wo n't mention the name  --  gave me the " Imagine you recalling those old words " routine , I said , " Listen , Galahad ! I know the lyrics to The Star-Spangled Banner , too , but it so happens I was n't around when they were written . " Some of t he samples I 've given of the Merman-type honesty may seem to make a hum out of the old saying , " Honesty is the best policy . " But hot or cold , hard or soft , sweet or sour , some of us ca n't play it any other way . Leonard Lyons ' wife , Sylvia , is like that . Leonard has a theory that all of his friends ought to be friends of one another . With this in mind , he arranged a party for Perle Mesta and me to meet each other . As Leonard tells it , what happened next was this : " Mrs. Mesta telephoned from Washington and submitted a list , of four dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believing that no dinner table can be considered enviable unless it is graced by the presence of Joe DiMaggio , startled the famed Washington hostess by telling her , ' Before I pick the date I must consult the home-games schedule of the New York Yankees , ' " A few days after that . party , I came home one afternoon and a maid who was working for me at the time said , " Some crackpot called this afternoon and said she was Margaret Truman. - " It probably was , " I said . " I met her the other night at the Lyons ' . What made you think she was a crackpot ? " " Well , " she said , " I thought she was one of your fans . " I 'm 81 ill trying to figure that one . She did n't mean what I thought she meant. , did she ? I do know this much : Any way you look at it , it waeri'l diplomat ic .

The last hat I bad was Easier before last , I went into a Fifth Avenue chapeau salon and had an Easter bonnet made , especially for my kind of hairdo . I said , " I want a hat made to accommodate my horse 's tail " el had one then , in addition to the topknot . So the custom-made department of the joint made me a bonnet .

EVENING POST I 'll put what Cole Porter says about my hair under the heading of Diplomacy . Being very international-set , Cole says my hair makes me look like a modern French painting by Monet or Renoir , or whoever . Tha t was the first time my topknot has keen compared with art . It 's been compared with everything else , even a poodle 's hairdo . My daughter , Ethel , says , " Our dog , Midnight , had the same pompon cut you 've got , mommy . " Midnight 's the French member of our family . Speaking of Monet and Renoir , I have a Renoir , it Monet and a Duly hanging on my walls now . From kibitzing around to I he different galleries I picked up a little thiasa and a little limas , until I 'm as hep as the average Judy about such matters now . I was n't in the beginning . One story ? of the many that Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  goes hack to the time when I knew from nothing about art . Howard and Buck seem to think it amusing , It goes this way : I 'd just had my apartment refurnished . I 'd had some nice things put into it , including some furniture , and in telling them about it I said , " And over the fireplace I 've got an original . " " An original what ? " Howard and Buck asked . " An original , you dopes , " I said . " Just an original . That 's all . " I found out later that 1 he chic thing to do would have been to give them the name of the art ist , but I did n't think that important . The man at the gallery I  --  ebruury 11 ? . ? - ? ? 5 who 'd sold it to me had just called it " an original " ? " Now here 's an original you ought to have " and " This is an interesting original " ? no t been what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints too . I 'm not that simple now . I only enjoy paintings if they 're restful to the eye  --  not anyone else 's eye  --  my eye . Phooey on this fellow Braque , who does paintings of men looking like consumptive hums . I do n't go for him . I 'd go to Eleanor Holm and Billy Rose 's place when she was married to him , and every time I went over there and looked at Billy 's Picasetos they drove me out of my mind . Some of them were the most gruesome-looking things I 've ever seen . Billy had put out fifteen grand for one of them ? a still life of some fruit . I said to Eleanor , ? ' Fifteen thousand bucks ! I could buy all of that fruit for thirty-five cents , and eat it besides . " But to continue with the physical rundown . Take my legs . This puts me on a spot , because , to be real honest about it , most people  --  including myself ? think I have nice gams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 've been no complaints about me in the Jane Russell department either . Period . do n't have bad arms , and lots of folks think I have expressive hands . And I have small ears , that lie flat against my head . As for my eyes , I 've been told that I 'm round-eyed and look surprised . What 's wrong with that ? I think - surprised " is a good way for a dame to look  --  although it went out with the waltz . Who wants a girl who knows everything ? Let 's put it this way : I use my eyes the best way I can to get the most out of them , particularly when I 'm on a sound stage or just an ordinary stage , standing in a spotlight . At such a time , having my lashes spiked with cosmetics helps . Sometimes I do n't have to say a word to get my thoughts across to an audience ; I just give them a look and my eyes tell the whole story . As for my bad points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say that , people tell me , " Do n't be silly . Your nose is O.K. It goes with your face , does n't it ' ?

Make mine a face with high cheekbones , like Marlene Dietrich 's , please . Another of my had points has been taken care of . I used to wear clothes that were too fancy . One of my best pals , the playwright and writer of lyrics , Dorothy Fields , once said of me not long ago , " Merm has chic now . She understands simplicity and the value of clean lines , but I can remember when there was n't room on her for all of the frills , furbelows , furs and jewelry she wanted to wear . Anything Mermsy could n't wear she carried over her arm . " So I 've learned better . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's practically impossible to tell me from any other woman . I once felt the same about stage make-up . The more the better , I thought . I was a girl who went all out for everything . As for other personal weaknesseis , I 'm no bookworm . I read the Hollywood Reporter and the Daily and Weekly Variety , to find out . what 's what . And I usually go through Winellen and Sullivan and Sobol , but that about wraps it up . I tried reading books , but the only time I had for it was when I got home from the theater at night . And even if I came straight home from a performance , I did n't get home until midnight or a quarter petit twelve . And I 'd lw so I fired that I 'd raid the icebox , stack myself a sandwich and guzzle a glass of milk , then go upstairs and conk off .

In spite of baying more of what a friend of mine named Eadie used to call savoir fairy " than most people  --  take his remark about my topknot  --  Cole Porter can be honest too . Cole and a buddy of his have a game they play that involves Irving Berlin . When they see Irving coming they look at their wrist watches and make a five-dollar bet . Then they pick a topic and start in on it . Anything will do : Victor Moore , Mount Everest , volcanoes , Philadelphia , the Dalai Lama of Tibet . The bet is based on the number of minutes it will take Irving to bring the conversation around to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cole says the average time is less than five minutes . I would n't go so far as to call this ego on Irving 's part . It 's just that he 's so absorbed in his work and so intense about it that what he writes is the most important thing in the world to him . This is no knock to Irving . To me , he does n't seem so much egotistical as enthusiastic . Every time I see him I like him better . We get along fine . Speaking of being absorbed in your work , Cole once told a writer who was trying to interview him , " If I do n't seem to he listening to what you 're saying , it 's because I 'm writing a song in the back of my head . " He 's so absorbed , sometimes he 's in another world . As Cole once put it , " Some people think work is a four-letter word . I do n't .

It may have been an accident that I was born n little girl with a big voice  --  the description of me I like best is " n doll from Astoria with a trumpet in her throat " '  - -  but ever since I was five I 've been standing on my own hind legs and selling the voice I was born with for all I was worth . If selling it good is luck , then I 've been lucky . My philosophy is this : If you 're able to develop yourself into a top performer at anything , face it bravely , sister . Admit it instead of blushing prettily , twisting your apron and scuffing your toe in the dust . There was once a song about Lindbergh . It was called Lucky Lindy ! To me , it was the biggest batch of applesauce ever cooked up . Lindy was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was  --  and is  --  a pro . " Lucky " Lindy my foot ! It 's hard for me to talk along these lines without sounding like a big operator in the " and then I wrote " department . This is a theatrical expression a certain kind of song writer uses . He 's at a party . he sees a piano , and without waiting for anybody to ask him , he springs at that stool and plays one of his songs . Then , still with no urging from anybody , he says , " And then I wrote ? " and he mentions the name of another of his songs and plays that one , too , ready or not . And so be goes , on and on and on . That 's where the expression came from  --  from those characters who sit down and play their whole repertoire . And nobody can stop them . Well , I 've got my own " and then I wrote " department . In it are such things as " Ethel Merman certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , " and " If she had to , she could put over the Boy Scout oath in song or Article Four , Section One of the Constitution . " I wish I could remember the names of the two nice guys who said that . Then I love something Buddy DeSylva said : " Watching Merman in a show after she 's got her lines and her songs and her stage business all set is like watching a movie after it 's been filmed and edited . After that , no matter how many times you see it and hear it , it 's always the same . " Buddy was the first to star me  --  God rest his soul . He put my name up in lights on a marquee : ETHEL MERMAN IN PANAMA HATTIE . Previously I had always costarred . " You 're ready , " Buddy said . " There 's no reason why you ca n't carry a show by yourself , like a suitcase . " It WAS then that I got a load of the nice things that come wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of a sudden I had an ermine wrap , a mink coat , a broadtail and silver fox , and a dressing room right off the wings . In addition to furs and a first-floor dressing room , I had El maid , an apartment in Central Park West , and a car and chauffeur . I soon sold the car . It was in dead storage most of the time . Where can you go in New York anyway ' ? I got rid of it , and I 've never bought one since . I lived at 25 Central Park West , so I was close to anywhere I wanted to go . If I wanted to shop on Fifth Avenue , the walk across Central Park was good for me . With a car , there was no place to park , and my driver had to keep on going round and round the block . Usually I came out of a store just in time to see him whiz by , and I 'd have to wait I hirty minutes for him to get around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in for walking or jumping taxis . If it was a special occasion arid I had on a long evening dress , particularly in the winter and I did n't want to mess up the dress on a wet cab floor , I 'd hire a car and chnulTeur . In the end , it was a relief not to have that chnulfeur and car hanging around . Anyhow , that jockey wore out three clutches in a year . He was clutch happy . He did what hackies and truckers called " riding the clutch , " Every time he breathed he used it ? voom ! I keep the various attempts people have made at unaly4ing my voice in my " and then I wrote ? " collection too . I 've collected a Int of those descriptions and comparisons , or whatever . Some of them are amusing , some interesting , some I do n't , dig nt all . I 'll bets in a few . It 's been said that I can bold a note as long as the Chase National Bank . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold one pretty long . I held a middle C , in I Got Rhythm , for sixteen bars . 1 began with the second chorus of " 1 got rhythm , " only instead of singing , I made en " Ah-h-h-h " sound and held it. , The hand played the melody , and I held the note over it . This did n't require any training in breathing and stomach control . I just took a breath and held it . God gave me my voice , and it 's always been on hand , good and loud and brassy , when I needed it . I do n't know whether Toscanini 's remark about me is an item for my collection or not . See how you figure it , . His son-in-law took him to hear me in Anything Goes ; he listened for a while , then turned to his son-in-law and used a word which meant the beet qualities of a female voice mixed with a masculine voice . When this was repeated to me , I was snowed , but it was explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get the perfect voice for grand opera or for a church choir , they hunted around until they 'd found singers who sounded like grown-up choir boys . The way I get it , Toscanini was saying that my voice has a double-sexed quality . He also said , " Hers is not a human voice . It 's another instrument in the hand . " As for the instrument Toscanini mentioned ? it 's a Merman horn . And I 've been blowing it since I was five . Walter Winchell put it another way . He said I was born with a silver tune in my mouth . Somebody else  --  not . Toscanini  --  said , " Merman 's voice has the hard forthrightness of a jazz trumpet  --  an ability to stay on pitch while she ' shouts at the top of her lungs . " Another critic said ? I think this one ordinarily covered the Met ? " She has a big , well-focused contralto . You might say it goes on a straight line . " I 've tried many times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's on key . " As for " well focused , " I 've never heard of that . For such long-hair expressions I 'm Mortimer Snerd . At . the end of his take-out on me , this same guy broke down and said , " Hell , it 's quite an organ . It 's got ping . I guess she 's got leather down t here . " There 's no doubt that my vocal cords are durable . They are also low down and all alone by themselves . Whenever I felt any throat trouble coming on , I 'd go to Dr. Stuart Craig , and he 'd dose me and pull me back in shape . I remember Doctor Craig saying , " I ca n't even see your vocal cords . They must be somewhere down in your calves . " So I get the picture that mine are different from everybody else 's , at least in where they 're placed . Going from tonsils to tenses , so far I 've talked a lot about the Levitts . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy named Bob Six . It 's about time I was getting to the present tense and talking about the Sixes . I wo n't tell how I met him ; that 'll come later , when I get to clicking this off on a more or lees year-to-year basis . But I want to make it plain right now that I 'm happy the way I am . I liked Six the minute I met him , but I tried not to let him know it . For one thing , I did n't think I was interested in getting married again . I 'd been married a long time and had had two children . But , not to be girlish about it , I was crazy about Six . After I got to know him , I prayed that we 'd get together someday , although I knew he lived in Denver . I love my father and my mother very much . When I married Bob Six and went to Denver , leaving the town where my parents live was a big decision . I considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my mind , that was it . The nice thing about Six is that he 's not a wise guy , in the Broadway meaning of the term . He 's something a lot more important than that ; he 's an adult . He 's a nice , big , easygoing guy who 's wonderful to me . He makes me feel young and beautiful , and in case you did n't know it , that does a lot for a woman . When I 'm dressed up to go out , he 'll say , " You look nice . " If a man puts out a kind word like that once in a while , that 's quite a man . If I wo n't wear it . It takes all the fun out of it . I may wear it again , to lunch with the girl friends . I do n't wear it with him . It 's funny , when I talk to old friends of mine , like Irving Berlin and Dorothy Fickle , or Arthur Schwartz , and Howard Lindsay and Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back working in another Broadway show with h them someday . When I say , " But I 'm not coming back to New York , " somebody mentions the fact that Bob Six travels a lot . " Yes , " I say , " he 's gone for two days , three days , maybe even more , but still that 's not the kind of separation it would be if I was in a New York show that ran two or three years , the way Annie did , while my husband lives in Denver . I like the kind of life I lead now , because when Bob has to go away , I 'm free to go with him . What 's more , he wants me to go with him . If I were in a New York show , I could n't do it . " I know people say , " When you marry Merman , if you do n't like being married to a self-sufficient woman you 're out of luck . " I do n't agree with that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendously . I ask for his opinion on so many things and I value it when he gives it to me . To tell you the truth , I 'm hungry for somebody to lean on when I 'm bushed  --  and I do n't mean just physically . I 'll give you another clue . Everybody wants security , but to a woman security is not just money . After all , Hetty Green had that , and how happy was she ? Securiby is also a husband , a home , kids . I 'm very happy with Six . This guy is great for me . He loves my friends and he loves the theater , but first of all he 's a businessman . Not only do I have somebody I 'm in love with , but I have a man who 's interested in my work and my business . The only thing he 's ever asked of me is , " Please do n't use any four-letter words in front of other people . " It seemed a reasonable request . Suppose I did go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the income-tax setup is , if a show runs a year and a half , after the first four months the money I make out of it belongs to the Government . In the meantime , since I 'm a star who 's interested in her job and I never slough a performance , afternoon or evening , I 'm knocking my brains out . Matinee days are tough ; two shows a day drain a girl . What I 'd like to do is work in one picture a year , take on about four television dates , and have my home life too . That way I wo n't be tied down and I can travel with Six when he travels . Besides , with a movie a year and a few TV shows , you 've got something different going all the I ime . It 's not much to ask . I 'm only asking to have my cake and eat it too .
