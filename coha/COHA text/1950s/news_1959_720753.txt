txt WASHINGTON , Sept. 26 ? The Republican party has tentatively decided to proclaim a policy of peaceful " emancipation " from Soviet rule for the Communist states of Eastern Europe . This is made clear in a working paper of the Republican Committee on Program and Progress , charged with drafting a long-range statement -a G. 0 . P. policy and objectives . The committee , whose formation was announced . from . the White House in February , is headed by Charles H. , Percy , an industrialist of Kenilworth , Ill . Although . a finished draft of its policy guide for the G. 0 . P. is not . expected until next month , the committee 's tentative conclusions were obtained today in a lengthy working paper dealContinued on Pain 41 , Column 7 FREE EAST EUROPE AMONG G.O.P.

P. since 1952 , the committee states that " a paramount goal " must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who have been deprived of it by communism . " The statement continues : " We are not reconciled to thel captivity of millions by Com-I , munist masters , nor do we regard this as their permanent condition . Our policy in relation to Communist satellites is emancipation  --  achieved not by the use of force from without , ' but primarily by the appeal of freedom to the minds of men everywhere . " For the achievement of emancipation , our weapons are not military , but ideological , psychological , political , econom-1 is and diplomatic . For these ' non military forces to be fully effective our military power must be sufficient to neutralize the threat of Communist arms . " To Watch for ' Cracks ' " We must be alert to any cracks in the empire which the Communists are trying to build . We must encourage and exploit any weakening of the bonds that tie the satellites to Moscow , " it said . This subject in the Republican group 's working paper is expected to attract much attention . When Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vice President Richard M. Nixon 's tour of the Soviet Union last July , it created a furor in that country . It also prompted charges here that the " timing " was bad and an unnecessary provocation . In general , the statement of goals proposes no new departures for the G.O.P. Fundamentally , it is a restatement of the policies that have been developed by the Eisenhower administration .

It proclaims continued Republican opposition to the recognition of Communist China , either by this Government or the United Nations . It emphasizes the need for dollar stability and the importance of private initiative to economic growth .

It proposes that development programs  --  now largely financed by dollar loans that will bring little dollar return ? be " progressively shifted to more economical bases of extended ( private investments and loans with political and financial guarantees . " Trade Balance Problem The problem of the future , the committee continues , is not likely to be a dollar shortage among the non-Communist nations , but a balance of payments shortage for this country . The Percy committee consists of forty-four prominent Republicans representing a cross-section of the party . It was authorized last January during a meeting of the Republican national committee in Des Moines , Iowa . At that time , representatives of the " old guard " complained publicly about a lack of political direction from the White House land broadly hinted that they blamed so-called " modern " ReIpublicanism for heavy losses in the November elections .
