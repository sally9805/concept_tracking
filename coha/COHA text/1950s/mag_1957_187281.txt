The Cave Dwellers ( by William Saroyan ) are broken-down performers camping out in a crumbling , abandoned East Side theater . A done-for boxer , a beat old clown , an ailing old actress are joined by a sweet young girl and a man with a trained bear and a wife who gives birth to a baby . By day they lie abed , or street-beg , or in desperation steal milk . By night they act out their old roles , philosophize , soliloquize , dramatize the day 's rebuffs , fall asleep and dream . <P> With his first Broadway play in 14 years , Saroyan is clearly back at the same old stand , making the same old pitch-but without his onetime showmanship . He was often soupy and boozy about the down-at-heel in the old days ; but at his best , as in The Time of Your Life , he had an alcoholic gaiety and verve , and a real knack for brewing instant-vaudeville . The poet in him might slump or the philosopher babble , but the prankster sufficiently triumphed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-spirited toastmaster to waif-dom , but its long-winded poet laureate . There are the usual variety turns , but not much seems cockeyed or even imaginative . There are sad-eyed little gallantries instead ; and even when Saroyan half-mocks at stage doings , he seems half-mawkish . His people are not just too good to be true , but mostly too good to be interesting . Their one message is love , love for one another ; all is love , the secret of the theater is love , even hate is love . All this , however devoutly to be wished for , not only remains fairly dubious as fact ; it never soars as poetry , or gets moving as drama . Saroyan 's words are too many and too vague ; the dialogue , at moments , even sounds as if the actors were unsure of their lines . As it happens , the actors are extremely good . As staged by Carmen Capalbo , the production provides lift : Barry Jones makes a fine-flowing aria of his unhappiness , Eugenie Leontovitch a bright nonsense piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter if Saroyan wrote first with an eraser-to wipe out reality-if afterwards , with a pen , he created magic . But this play has little magic : only a stab of pathos , now and then , in a wilderness of plight ; or a flash of color , humor , poetry amid constant murmuration . <P> Nature 's Way ( by Herman Wouk ) is a loud farce , full of rib-nudging situations , about a young musicomedy composer and his wife . It opens forte , with the wife six months pregnant . It next reveals that the young couple are four months married . Then the composer 's homosexual collaborator appears , to lure the husband to Venice as a better place to work . Among other callers in the expensive , brick-walled penthouse are a very modern and very muddled obstetrician , a very airy and very ruthless lady decorator . Eventually there is a second homosexual , and ultimately a batch of shoddy theater folk . <P> Nature 's Way seems one more frantic farce that relies for its laughs on gamy subject matter rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to the wall , literally has the bricks come flying out of it . What chiefly seems odd in all this is that Herman Wouk should be the author . But as the show proceeds , it becomes plain that there is a message in its madness-that with every tasteless gag , Wouk is bopping whatever repels him as newfangled or decadent , including Picasso .
