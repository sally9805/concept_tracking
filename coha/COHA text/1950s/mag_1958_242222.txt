In the crowded lecture hall of the San Francisco Museum of Art gathered a who 's who of art , from black-tied sponsors to shaggy bohemians . The reception committee numbered 50 strong , ranged alphabetically from the Association of San Francisco Potters to the World Affairs Council . Sitting nervously on the stage , and at times close to tears , was the object of this outpouring of affection : durable , forthright Dr. Grace Louise McCann Morley , 57 ( TIME , Feb. 28 , 1955 ) .

Henry Moore 's carved-wood Reclining Woman stood as symbol of her unceasing effort to bring the best of modern art to San Francisco , thus help bridge the gap that had tended to keep the West Coast ten to fifteen years behind trends set in Paris and Manhattan . <P> Behind her , Grace Morley is leaving a museum she has built up from scratch , and that now boasts a growing first-rate collection , an active membership of 4,400 , an annual operating budget of $150,000 . Says she , " I 'm rather happy-my sense is of ' mission accomplished .
