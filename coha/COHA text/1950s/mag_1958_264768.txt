Cries from the Jungle <P> Sir : " Pink Jungle " June 16 . How could you do it ! American men should know better , but any non-American reading that article would really be convinced that all American women are naught but a flock of foolish painted sheep . Also , unlike a decent , useful flock of sheep who always know their shepherd , we ca n't even be sure who is the crazy shepherd of the painted flock . <P> For the millions of us who are n't like that-I 'm mad ! <P> DOROTHY T. GIBNEY Hempstead , N.Y . <P> Sir : I wonder if La Pompadour went to bed all gooked up ? If not , how ever did she get her " psychological lift " ? <P> MRS . W. L. VENNING JR . Boise , Idaho <P> Sir : I am a farmer 's wife , and this letter is prompted by Max Factor 's remark and insinuation that farm women do not wear lipstick ! I would like Mr. Factor to know that my hair is styled at Antoine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did buy Max Factor 's lipstick . <P> MRS . CLARK ROBINSON Coldharbor , N. Dak . <P> Sir : I liked the story , although I am pretty sure some of our people will be a bit unhappy . Some of them usually are . <P> S. L. MAYHAM Executive Vice President The Toilet Goods Assoc. , Inc . New York City <P> SIR : SINCE I AM ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE " INDUSTRY " MENTIONED AS CONFESSING TO A FAILURE TO SELL MORE PERFUME TO AMERICAN WOMEN , PERMIT ME TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT . THE PROBLEM IS NOT TO SELL WOMEN BUT TO SELL MEN , WHO BUY 75% OF ALL PERFUME WORN BY WOMEN . MEN BUY THE PERFUME THEY WANT WOMEN TO WEAR , AND WOMAN WOULD DO WELL TO STAY WITH THAT PERFUME AS LONG AS SHE STAYS WITH THE MAN . <P> EDOUARD L. COURNAND PRESIDENT LANVIN PARFUMS , INC . NEW YORK CITY <P> Sir : Who wants to smell like everyone else at $12 a drop ? My husband 's after-shave lotion makes me unique among most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 98 a family-size bottle . <P> MRS . JOHN A. GRES Washington , B.C. <P> Sir : The American woman really has no desire to look beautiful , or else she would not spend so much time eating rich foods . The U.S. is rapidly producing painted women who are but shells of bleached and dyed hair , and aglow with exotic scents . They are afraid to face themselves as they are . <P> JEREMY S. WOOD Upper Montclair , NJ . <P> Sir : Poor Jean Locke-she must feel like she 'd been hit in the face with a custard pie , and left to dry ! <P> MARJEANE ADAMS Arcadia , Calif . <P> Sir : If , with all their know-how , experience and wealth , Mesdames Arden and Rubinstein have not succeeded in evading wrinkles , why should I try ? <P> J. MORISON New York City <P> Crybaby Generation <P> Sir : Only one with a heart of stone could stand unmoved by the trials and tribulations of the American Beats and the English Angries June 9 . Nor is history likely to forget them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straighter his head a little higher , in the presence of whines and howls and poor-folks writing , there will always be a place in his memory for the Crybaby Generation . <P> NUNNALLY JOHNSON Beverly Hills , Calif . <P> Sir : All this foaming by the Beat Generation and the Angry Young Men is the result of overpopulation , the taking of oneself too seriously , and the herd instinct to compare one 's lot with one 's fellow man . <P> C. OVERILL Santa Ana . Calif . <P> Counterpoint
