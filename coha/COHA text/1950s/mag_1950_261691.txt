<P> " Great events are happening , " said Winston Churchill , who knows a great event when he sees one . Churchill was talking of last week 's decisions in the West 's cold war against Communism . The North Atlantic Council in London made a decision that lifted the West 's alliance off its neat , stiff treaty paper and pushed it toward organizational reality . The council 's communiqu spoke of " the creation of balanced collective forces in the progressive buildup of the defense of the North Atlantic area . . . " <P> In simple English , that meant a military division of labor . Instead of all major North Atlantic Treaty nations trying to maintain self-sufficient armies , navies and air forces , each would eventually take on one main defense job for all ( see below ) . The plan was more than an advance toward efficiency : it was an unprecedented step toward military interdependence among the allies which asserted beyond all solemn assurances that they would hang together . Said one U.S. observer : " If you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of their shores , and the British to rely on French infantry to hold a common defense line on the Continent , then you are really getting somewhere . " <P> Taken together with the Atlantic Council 's decision to set up a joint cold war high command , and the Schuman proposal to pool French and German heavy industry ( TIME , May 22 ) , the new defense plan was the strongest impulse toward real union that the West 's heart had felt . <P> Said Churchill : " Great events are happening and we must not allow the ceaseless clack and clatter which is the characteristic of our age to turn our minds from them . I still hope that the unity now being established among all the Western democracies and Atlantic powers will ward off from us the terror and unspeakable miseries of a third world war .
