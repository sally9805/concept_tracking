On the first of August the Israeli ambassador in Moscow transmitted to Jerusalem a threatening note he had been handed by the Soviet government . The next day Washington learned that Israel was about to ban the overflights of U.S. and British planes across Israeli territory , thereby cutting off the vital airlift of oil and supplies , one of the few trickles of aid that is reaching beleaguered Jordan . <P> Secretary of State Dulles , not believing that Israel could be intimidated by the sort of blustering Soviet note that the Turks receive and reject nearly every month , summoned Israeli Ambassador Abba Eban to see what the Israelis were up to . Israel did impose a ban on overflights , only to lift it " temporarily " three days later-for U.S. planes only . <P> Apparently Ben-Gurion 's government was not so much frightened by the Russian note as eager to use the overflight permission as a bargaining lever to force the U.S. and Britain into heeding Israel 's feelings . There had also been other pressures on Ben-Gurion besides Russia 's .

Furthermore , Israel has tried to avoid backing one faction or another among Arab powers , whether Hussein or Nasser , on the ground that all are violently anti-Israel . <P> What the Israelis particularly hoped for were positive assurances , in writing and publicly pronounced , that Washington and London would work to guarantee Israel 's borders , and would come to Israel 's aid if it was attacked . At week 's end Israel 's Milwaukee-raised Foreign Minister Golda Meir was invited to London on short notice . She had just held " satisfactory " talks with the French in Paris , where the De Gaulle government promised stepped-up arms shipments ( Israel and France have been buddies against Nasser since Suez ) . From the British , about whom Israelis feel less sure , Minister Meir wanted a briefing on their intentions in Jordan , and a definite promise that , if the British do pull out , they will leave no arms behind them that could be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
