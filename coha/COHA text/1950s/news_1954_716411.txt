txt WASHINGTON , July 18 ? Senate leaders of , the Administration 's fight for a flexible farm price support system asserted today that they had the votes to put across President Eisenhower 's program . They made the claim as they prepared to seek in the Senate more flexibility in price supports than voted by the House of Representatives . Senator George D. Aiken , Republican of Vermont and chairman of the ' Senate Agriculture Committee , said that he would ask the Senate for a variable price scale of 80 to 90 per cent of parity . The House put the level of parity supports at 82.5 to 90 per cent to give President Eisenhower what he called " a great and sweeping victory . ' This level would apply to the so-called basic crops of wheat , corn , cotton , rice and peanuts . The Senate committee 's farm bill is scheduled to be debated this week . It provides for a oneyear extension of the 90 per cent This figure was recommended by an 8-to-7 vote of the committee . The House Agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level for another year . The President had called for a 75-90 range , but the 82.5 per cent floor was backed in the House by Administration leaders . The President said later that he would not have permitted the level to drop below 80 per cent in .1955 in any event . Bill 's Importance Stressed Parity is a Federal standard designed VS give farmers a fair return on their products in relation to their costs . Senat-or William F. Knowland of California , Senate Republican leader , said that he had made his plea for a flexible system on the floor yesterday because he wanted to focus the Senate 's attention on the importance of the farm bill . His admonition that the farm program might collapse of its own weight unless flexible props were voted was dropped into the middle of a debate over atomic law revisions . His unusual timing aroused speculation as to his reason . Senator Aiken said that he would offer his 80-to-90 per cent amendment to the farm measure tomorrow . It is one of three amendments he plans to introduce to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would : 4/Eliminate the bill 's mandatory increase of dairy supports from the present 75 per cent of parity level to 85 per cent . The Aiken proposal also would permit the flexible support of fluid milk as well as butter , cheese and dried milk . The House increased the dairy support to 80 per cent . Ezra Taft Benson , Secretary of Agriculture , slashed the support from 90 to 75 per cent last April 1 to help prevent the piling up of surpluses . clRestore the discretionary 75-to-90 per cent price support levels on small grains , such as sorghums , oats , barley and rye . The bill ties the support levels of these small grains to those of corn on a feed value equivalent basis . Price Signals Impaired I Senator Aiken denounced the ; mall grain provision as a " prime example of the lack of wisdom in trying to , operate our economic system by a , rigid political formula . " " Supply and demand relationships are constantly changing , " he said . " Prices reflect these changes . A frozen pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signals of prices which are needed by both producers and consumers . " Senator Aiken predicted about fifty Senators would vote for the flexible principle . The full Senate membership is ninety-six . Senator Milton R. Young of North Dakota , No. 2 Republican Ion the Senate Agriculture Committee , gave a continuation of the rigid supports a fifty-fifty chance . Meanwhile , the Administration was faced with a Continuing drought problem that might force Mr. Benson to resume a beef buying program . The Agriculture Department also oiled its machinery for a // referendum on strict Federal controls among wheat farmers on Friday . The wheat producers will vote on whether - they rwish another year , of , marketing quotas that would enforce the 1955 planting goal of 55,000,000 acres . Mr. ' Benson has slashed the acreage allotment to the legal minimum in an effort to reduce surpluses . This was a cut of about 11 per cent from the 62,000,000 acres planted under controls this year and 20 per cent below the 78,000,000 acres sown , with restrictions , in 1953 . The marketing quotas would restrict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The growers accepted the quotas on this year 's crop by a 7-to-1 margin in a referendum last fall . Two-thirds of the farmers voting must approve the quotas to make them effective .. If the quotas are rejected , the support price for wheat automatically would drop to 50 per cent of parity , or $1.25 a bushel . This compares with a support price of $2.24 a bushel this year . The farmers this year also must comply with new regulations , regarded as the most drastic controls in history , to get price supports . They must comply with all Federal planting allotments for , all crops to get price supports on any crop . The drought situation , particularly in the Southwest , has been under close watch by the Agriculture Department . Ross Rizley , Assistant Secretary of Agriculture , was sent to the area last week as demands arose on Capitol Hill and elsewhere for renewed Federal aid . The department last year made large quantities of feed available at cut rate prices and stepped up beef buying in an effort to save cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " unprecedented heat and drought had created a critical condition in several areas of the West . " He said that Federal reclamation projects were undergoing their most severe test in years to meet irrigation water needs . Areas ? of Oklahoma . Missouri , Texas and New Mexico are reported in poor condition from the drought .
