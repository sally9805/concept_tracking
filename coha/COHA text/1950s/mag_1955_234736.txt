The market for modern art is booming as never before . Some startling particulars of the boom were ticked off this week by Collector-Critic James Thrall Soby , writing in the Saturday Review : " If the prices for Matisse , Picasso , Rouault and Bonnard have tripled or quadrupled since the war , those of some of their less overwhelming colleagues have soared in far greater proportion ... A Kandinsky costing less than $1,000 in 1930 would now fetch about $8,000 ; a Mondrian actually bought by an American museum 20 years ago for $400 would be almost $10,000 today . . . Paul Klees , which used to be less than $500 , are now ten times that price and going up steadily . " <P> Soby himself is bullish , with reservations : " Certainly some of the famous artists of the past 75 years may one day slide abruptly down the banister of the staircase their market has ascended by stages ; some will make the climb again ; others will slump forever at the bottom of the flight . It seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hold their lofty place or go still higher . "
