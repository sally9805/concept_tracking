Three months ago British Playwright R. C. Sherriff ( Journey 's End ) turned down a $28,000 offer to write a movie scenario for Hollywood . Reason : after paying Socialist Britain 's income tax , Sherriff reckoned that he would have only $1,400 of his earnings left ( TIME , March 27 ) . Last week another British writer announced his intention to strike against the exorbitant tax rates . From his latest book Legacy , Novelist Nevil Shute ( Pastoral , Chequer Board ) expects to make about 18,000 ( $50,400 ) , but after paying British taxes he will be able to keep only about 3,000 . To save a smitch of his earnings on Legacy and future books , Novelist Shute ( real name : Nevil Shute Norway ) concluded he simply would have to get out of Britain and plans next month to leave his home on Hayling Island in Hampshire and move to Australia . <P> The refugee author and his family will be accompanied by Shute 's faithful private secretary , the Shute gardener and handyman , and his four-seater Percival-Proctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal way for an author to travel " ) . Says Shute : " I want my two daughters to finish their education in Australia . At the end of five years , they can decide if they want to stay in that prosperous but somewhat uncultured country or return to this bleak but cultured and traditional land . " Even down under , Shute estimates , he would be able to pocket only a puny 5,760 of Legacy 's profits . Nevertheless , he says , " there 's a Conservative government in Australia , so we may hope to see taxes fall there . Here , I do n't think they ever will . "
