There is usually one Communist who knows the way the wind is blowing long before the official weather vanes swing into line . In stormy Poland he is a longtime Stalinist timeserver named Jerzy Putrament . When Wladyslaw Gomulka broke with Moscow last October , Comrade Putrament was so enthusiastic in Gomulka 's support that Pravda publicly rebuked him for saying that he preferred " imperialist Coca-Cola to the best home-distilled vodka . " Last month Weatherman Putrament held up a moist forefinger and got the feel of a new breeze blowing through Poland . The country , he said forthwith , was drifting away from Socialism into anarchy , thus creating the danger of " Hungarian tragedies . " He accused the young hotheads in the vanguard of Gomulka 's national movement of " cheerfully blowing up the very bases of our ideology . " <P> Putrament 's forecast was hardly in print before the Politburo was directing all Polish Communists to fight on two fronts : against " sectarians , " a discreet new name for the Stalinists , and against " revisionists , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week it was becoming clearer that the brunt of the attack is being borne by the revisionists . <P> Follow or Fight . The first revisionists to go were the young newspaper editors who had dared to criticize the Soviet Union . Scolding the editor of Trybuna Ludu , the main party newspaper , for expressing " adventurous private opinions , " Gomulka sent him off to a minor party job in the provinces , took the resignations of eight staff members , and appointed as new editor a party hack who had run the newspaper during the years Gomulka was in jail . A magazine was confiscated , and its editor fired , when it reprinted an angry article on Stalinism by French ex-Fellow Traveler Jean-Paul Sartre . An iron censorship was imposed on the bright reformist weeklies . Said one ex-editor : " I can not follow Gomulka on this . But I can not fight him , either . " <P> Revisionists were unwilling to fight Gomulka because most of them sensed that he was acting to impose needed discipline on his confused party . Many young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bourgeois democracy forthwith , when it was obvious that the Russians were still watching and calculating every move in Poland . But there were deeper murmurs of discontent when Gomulka began replacing revisionists with sectarians in his government . <P> In the crucial hours of the October revolt , Warsaw Committee First Secretary Stefan Staszewski backed Gomulka to the hilt , mobilized thousands of Warsaw students and workers into a scratch militia to fight the Russians if necessary . A fortnight ago Staszewski was replaced by a party functionary . Into top ministerial jobs went two other onetime Stalinists who had opposed Gomulka 's early program . But the appointment which caused most suspicion was that of blond , poker-faced Zenon Nowak . <P> Party Conscience . Nowak was a member of the hated Bierut Politburo during the years Gomulka was under arrest , a sponsor of schemes to prevent Gomulka 's return to power after the Poznan riots , a champion of the policy of encouraging anti-Semitism in order to divert the anger of the masses from the Stalinist party leaders .
