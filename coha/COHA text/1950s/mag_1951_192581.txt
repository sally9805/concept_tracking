Hardly an eyebrow flickered when the Senate Appropriations Committee last week voted its approval of the House 's $56 billion appropriation for the armed forces in fiscal 1952 . But when the Senators also voted to shove another $5 billion into the hands of Defense Secretary Marshall for what was described only as " additional air power , " they threw the capital into a tailspin of speculation . <P> Harry Truman himself , talking to a roomful of Democrats in San Francisco ( see The Presidency ) , gave the first wild whirl . " It is fantastic what can happen with the use of the new weapons that are now under construction in this country , " he ad-libbed solemnly , " not only the one which we all fear the most , but there are some weapons which are fantastic in their operation . " Most of Washington regarded this as just another Truman ad-liberty , but one reporter dug up North Dakota 's garrulous Milton Young , a member of the Senate committee which had been considering the $5 billion , and asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Young , " they are new and terrible weapons of war that are just beyond imagination . . . something new and different . . . even more startling than germ warfare . . . It 's something I never thought of . It is as closely guarded a secret as atomic weapons , but it will cost nothing like as much to produce . . . " Did the knowledge of the new weapons have anything to do with passage of the $5 billion ? " Of course , " said Subcommittee Chairman Joe O'Mahoney of Wyoming . South Carolina 's Burnet Maybank added a slight damper . Appropriations for " the weapons , " he said , were " small compared to $5 billion . " Most of the money in the $5 billion item was specifically ticketed for direct expansion of U.S. air power-to increase the Navy 's air arm as well as to start building the Air Force to the new congressional target of 163 wings . <P> What about the mystery weapons ? Speculation zipped through nerve gases , atomic dust , disintegrator rays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles ( see Armed Forces ) . Meanwhile the $61 billion bill spun toward final action on the Senate floor this week with new momentum .
