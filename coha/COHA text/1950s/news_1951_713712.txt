txt Mrs. Ruth Prince Greenglass took the stand yesterday as the Government 's fourth spy trial witness and corroborated in detail the story of wartime atomic espionage related earlier by her husband , David . David Greenglass has pleaded guilty ? to an indictment charging him with espionage for Soviet Russia in wartime and is waiting sentence . His wife was named in the indictment as a co-conspirator , but not as a defendant . As key Government witnesses , their testimony was directed at Julius Rosenberg and his wife , Ethel , two of the defendants on trial in United States District Court . Morton Sobel , electronics expert , is the third defendant . Another , Anatoli A. Yacovlev , fled the United States five years ago after serving here as Soviet vice counsel . Under a Federal statute , wartime espionage carries a possible death penalty . Through their combined testimony , Ruth and David Greenglass gave the jury of eleven men and one woman an illuminating picture of how Soviet spies operate . They also provided self-portraits of the // type of individual who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that of a devoted couple , living poorly on the lower East Side , the parents of two small children . Ruth testified that she was married at 18 after a high school education at Seward Park High School and a few night courses . David was 21 when they were married , a student struggling to become a machinist . Like a good husband , David gave her the money he realized from his , spy activities as an Army technical sergeant in the Los Alamos atomic bomb plant . Like a good wife , she put most of it in the bank and used some to pay " household expenses . " Neither she nor David believed they were committing a crime against the United States , but both conceded under cross-examination that their spy activities were " not right . " Several incongruous aspects marred this picture of everyday life . Ruth , a tall , buxom and selfpossessed brunette , testified that she had bought a United States defense bond for $37.50 while she was collecting atomic information for Russia in Los Alamos in November , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underground activities she engaged in with her husband to undermine national security . ' Tells of Trips to Los Alamos In seemingly eager , rapid fashion she related how she combined her spy courier work with her second wedding anniversary . She journeyed to Los Alamos by train to be with her husband in 1944 , using $150 , which she said was given to her by Julius Rosenberg . When Rosenberg told the Greenglasses to flee to Mexico early last year , she testified that she just could not ask her doctor for a " falsified certificate " that her four - member family had been inoculated against smallpox . She told the Court she was the mother of a boy 412 years old and a girl of 10 months . United States Attorney Irving H. Saypol has described the spy activities as " the greatest crime that could be committed against the people of the United States . " Mrs. Greenglass took the stand at 12:10 P. M. yesterday and told her story under examination by James Kilsheimer , 29-year-old Assistant . United States Attorney . She wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted in the middle , swept back over her ears and caught in a large bun at the nape of her neck . Paralleling her husband 's story , she told how Ethel and Julius Rosenberg had asked her to enlist David in the spy network in November , 1944 . She related that Rosenberg had told her not to worry about money in this work , since he would provide it . " Did he say where the money would come from ? " Judge Irving R. Kaufman asked . " Yes , " she replied , " he said from his friends . " " Who did he say his friends were ? " Judge Kaufman wanted to know . " The Russians , " the witness said . She related how the plot was hatched in the $45-a-month Rosenberg apartment in Knickerbocker Village . At first , she said , she was frightened and wanted nothing to do with it . At the insistence of Ethel Rosenberg , her husband 's sister , she said she agreed to carry the spying invitation to David in Los Alamos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , Harry Gold came to the Greenglass home at 209 North High Street , Albuquerque , N. M. , to take spy data from David back to Rosenberg . She said Gold identified himself through a cut-out portion of a Jello box she had last seen " in Julius Rosenberg 's hand " in New York seven months earlier . For this information she said Gold paid her husband $500 . " David gave me the money , " she testified . " I put $400 in the bank at Albuquerque , bought a $50 defense bond for $37.50 and used the rest of the money for household expenses . I realized then for the first time that this was c. o. d . David provided the information , and he received the money for it . " . In 1946 , Mrs. Greenglass testified , she wanted to go to the Federal Bureau of Investigation with the whole story . " But things had quieted down , and everything was peaceful and quiet , " she added . " But I was not calm . I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1950 , Julius came to see me and David He had a copy of The New York Herald Tribune with a picture of Harry Gold , and he said Gold had been arrested . He warned us that David would be next , and that the next arrest would occur between June 12 and June 16 . Julius wanted us to go to Mexico . " I said I Could not travel with a 10-day-old infant . But Julius said his doctor had told him I 'd be all right if I took along enough canned milk and boiled the water . Julius said we should go to the Soviet Union , by way of Mexico . " Julius gave us $1,000 , and I put $500 in the Manufacturers Trust . He asked me if.I could get a statement from my doctor that we had all been inoculated for smallpox . I told him I would not ask my doctor for a falsified statement that we had all been inoculated , so he said he would get one from his doctor . We had passport pictures taken , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct examination ended at 2:55 P. M. , Mrs. Greenglass was cross-examined by Alexander Bloch , 70-year-old defense lawyer for Mrs. Rosenberg , who is 35 . " Did n't you realize that you had I committed a crime against the United States by this spying ? " was Mr. Bloch 's first question . Mrs. Greenglass , who had avoided the words " spy " and " espionage " M her direct testimony , hesitated before replying carefully : " I think it 's wrong ? I 've always known it was wrong . " " Did n't you know that transmitting this information to Russia was a crime ? " the veteran lawyer persisted . " I did n't think it was right , " the witness answered . " Were n't you frightened of the F. B. I. ? " Mr. Bloch asked . " Everyone is frightened of the F. B. I. , but it was not because I realized it was a crime that I was frightened , " she said . " I did n't think the F. B. I. wanted my husband . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone much more important than he , and much more deeply involved . " Mr. Bloch tried to show that she and her husband had testified against the Rosenbergs in the hope of escaping ' punishment for their own acts . The young wife , pitting her first courtroom experience against his half-centpry of trial work , held her own well under harassing questioning . At one point Mr. Bloch had her repeat her story of her first conversation on spying with the Rosenbergs . When she gave it again almost word-for-word , he suggested that she had memorized her testimony . After a wrangle about her state of mipd after her husband was arrested , Judge Kaufman said : " I believe I can sum that up . You believed that you would be punished , but you hoped that you would not be . " Earlier Greenglass had completed three and one-half days on the stand . Defense counsel sought to show that his loss of several thousand dollars in a machine shop with Rosenberg had given him a motive ' for testifying against his brother-in-law . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' M. , Judge Kaufman adjourned the trial until 10:30 o'clock this morning .
