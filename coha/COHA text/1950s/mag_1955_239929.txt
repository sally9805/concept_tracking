Thanks to Turf Columnist Evan Shipman 's complaint , New York 's Metropolitan Jockey Club belatedly arranged to televise its last race of the spring meeting : the $111,700 mile-and-a-furlong Wood Memorial . And thanks to the desperate courage of Belair Stud 's big bay colt , Nashua , closing from behind in the final jump to nip Mrs. John W. Galbreath 's Summer Tan by a neck , millions of televiewers saw a thriller . <P> For the first time since the club was formed in a London pub half a century ago , Chelsea 's Stamford Bridge soccer team shouldered its way to the front of the First Division and won the English League title . <P> With thoroughgoing scorn for Kansas City 's big-league pretensions , the Chicago White Sox slammed so many home runs ( seven ) , and scored so often ( 29 times ) as they whipped the Athletics , 29-6 , that they tied the modern major-league scoring record for one team in one game . Co-record holders : the Boston Red Sox , who humiliated the St. Louis Browns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in traditional skimmers on the banks of the Schuylkill , the University of Pennsylvania 's varsity eight-oared crew pulled away from Princeton and Columbia , held its lead through the last mile of the Henley ( mile and five-sixteenths ) course , and held on to rowing 's senior sprint-racing trophy : the 76-year-old Childs Cup .
