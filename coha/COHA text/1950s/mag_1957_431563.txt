 | THE Indian Airlines plane glided smoothly past the broad expanse of the flooded Brahmaputra River , bounced in t:e rough air above the river 's forested edge , and settled on the small airstrip at Jorhat , r . Assam . The sun , breaking through monn clouds , gleamed hotly on wet leaves and pe.vement . I had come to this easternmost corner of India in the course of a year 's assignment to gather firsthand information on some of the world 's rarest animals and to seek effective ways of ensuring their survival . India was the twentieth of some thirty countries I was to visit during the year for the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources . Ungainly Relics of Prehistoric Times ' - Tomorrow 's fossils , " species threatened ' th extinction , are one of the many interests the IUC , an organization sponsored by the nited Nations Educational , Scientific and cultural Organization . My objective in Assam was the great Inn rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros unicornis ) , a uge relic of prehistoric times , when rhinos re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Six feet tall at the shoulders d fourteen feet long , the largest of these Indian rhinos has been estimated to weigh as uch as 4,000 pounds . A horn a foot or more long and a fierce position when aroused made him undisted lord of his Asian domain . And that main once extended from Indochina to the hyber Pass , from Kashmir to southern ailand ( map , page 390 ) . Encroaching agriculture and incessant huntmg have brought the Indian rhino to the verge of extinction . Today he survives as little more than a legend over much of his former range . Of the few hundred still in the wilds , the greater number live on five small reserves in India 's rainy State of Assam . A few others remain in near-by West Bengal and the isolated Kingdom of Nepal . Rhinos carry a fortune on their noses . Prices as high as 8150 a pound are currently offered by traders for their horns ? this in a land where a man may earn only a few cents a day . In Sumatra , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Chinese merchant recently offered a new American automobile for a whole rhinoceros ! Many Orientals believe every part of the animal 's body to have medicinal or magical values . Properly prepared , rhino is considered a specific for everything from restoring lost vitality to extracting thorns . The horn commands the highest price . Reduced to a powder , it becomes , especially in Chinese minds , a powerful aphrodisiac . Rhino-horn cups , believed to render poison harmless , were for centuries used by Eastern rulers . Such cups still figure in some Oriental religious ceremonies . Powdered , splintered , or whole , the horn is supposed to have wondrous powers for solving almost any problem , mental or physical ? all this with no known scientific basis , but with the unshakable faith of those concerned . So the wonder is not that there are so few rhinos , but that there are any left at all . Tea Planter Guards Indian Wildlife I was met at Jorhat by Mr. E. P. Gee , a leading authority on these ponderous mammals . A British tea planter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Since then he has served as a protector and spokesman for the rhinos of Kaziranga , and for Indian wildlife in general . As we drove from the airport to Mr. Gee 's estate , the road took us between plantations with their neat rows of flat-topped , three-foothigh tea plants , carpetlike beneath the tall trees that provide shade . It was bazaar day ? payday in the tea gardens . The main streets of the villages were jammed . Most of the gay crowd , Mr. Gee explained , were people who had come here from other parts of India to work on the tea estates . That evening we discussed the objects of my visit . Only about 350 great Indian rhinos are left in Assam , Mr. Gee estimated , most  | of them now protected in government re- best to protect serves . The largest number , about 250 , in- species . The habit the Kaziranga Wild Life Sanctuary , 50 miles down the Brahmaputra from the Jorhat airfield where I landed . This was the area the IUC had sent me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the century , when it was thought that only a dozen or so of the animals remained there . Under protection , the beasts have increased at a heart-warming rate . A staff of 40 Indians cares for the area and guards against would-be rhino hunters . In the early 1930 's the forest officer in charge of a neighboring sanctuary discovered poachers in the area ; so well organized were they that it required detachments of the Assam Rifles to clear them out . The Indian Government , I was happy to learn , fully appreciates the value of its unique charges . When I had the pleasure of meeting the Prime Minister , one of Mr. Nehru 's first questions was about the rhinos of Kaziranga . Rhino Habits Pose a Mystery Lack of precise information presents a major problem in the preservation of the Indian rhino . In Assam , for example , most of them are swamp dwellers , but no one knows whether this is through preference or because man has left them no other habitat . Beyond the fact that they are herbivorous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact gestation period remains uncertain . Since India has few trained wildlife technicians , government officials are not sure how the rhino and other vanishing IUC hopes to cooperate with Government in setting up a research program on the rhino , in which one or two experienced foreign scientists can work with Indian personnel . Fifteen-foot Grass Cloaks Sanctuary At 3:30 the next morning Mr. Gee and I started toward Kaziranga . The sanctuary lies on a low plain on the south bank of the Brahmaputra , bounded on one side by the river and on the other by the steep Mikir Hills . Its 164 square miles are mainly a flat expanse of waving elephant grass , reeds that grow more than 15 feet high although in much of the area they are burned yearly . Here and there appear open areas , called bils , which become lakes in the wet season . Narrow tree-covered ridges standing a few feet above the grass provide the only dry shelter for the animals when the broad river overflows its banks . Elephants are the only practical means of getting about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could cope with the alternating open water and virtual jungles of elephant grass , or the aggressiveness of some of the animal life , notably the wild elephant . the rhino , and the water buffalo . Three elephants were waiting for us at sanctuary headquarters , standing beside the road with mahouts dozing astride their necks . The largest , a famous old tusker named Akbar , towered more than nine feet at the shoulder . Considered the most reliable of the sanctuary 's mounts , he had met the ( Continued on page 395 )  | charges of both wild elephant and rhino . An elephant that will stand up to rhinos is highly respected ; most are terrified of them . All three of our animals carried on their backs large straw-filled canvas pads with ropes around the edges as handholds . The passengers arrange themselves on these gaddies , or elephant saddles , in any way that seems comfortable . The mahout sits on the elephant 's neck and directs him with his feet and a short , hooked metal bar . The elephants knelt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The animal stood up , front end first . The gaddi tilted alarmingly , and I had to grip its ropes strongly to keep from sliding back the way I had come . Eventually Mohan gained his feet , the gaddi leveled , and we were off . Villagers Fish in Flooded Fields Between the Mikir Hills and the sanctuary proper lies a mile-wide strip of farmland . Our elephants ' long , swinging strides took us quickly across this and through flooded rice fields : past sleepy water buffaloes with Assamese youngsters , bare except for large , round straw hats , sitting on their backs ; past other equally bare villagers fishing small crabs out of the flooded fields and proudly holding their catches aloft . Showy adjutants and black-necked storks watched us ride by ; herons and lapwings took to the air momentarily , to settle again a few yards away . As we swept across the grassland , a jackal bolted virtually under 141ohan 's feet . Then came two little hog deer , beautiful brownish animals with gracefully curving antlers . A disturbance in higher grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large animal almost the size of a sambar , called barasingha , or twelve-point , elsewhere in India because of its fine antlers. * A couple of hundred yards into the grass , Akbar 's mahout pointed to our right . All three elephants swung off in that direction . Ahead , in a mud wallow , lay a large rhinoceros showing indistinctly through the grass . It made no move until we had approached to within some thirty yards . Standing on our mobile observation tower , we seemed to be almost on top of the animal . It was lying in the muddy water with two or three feet of its back and head showing . Suddenly the rhino came out of the water with startling speed and stood dripping at the edge of the grass , eying us . Its skin at Indian Rhino 395 hung in great folds at the neck , shoulders . and hindquarters , giving the appearance of armor plate . The flanks and legs , wet and gleaming in the sun , were studded with tubercles that looked like rivet heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick , blunt horn . Here was really a most improbable creature , a relic of ancient days . The rhino interrupted my thoughts with a loud snort and wheeled off through the grass . For an animal of such size and weight it showed amazing agility , appearing to trot along lightly and effortlessly . yet leaving tracks two feet deep in the mud and passing easily through stands of reeds that our elephants parted with visible effort . Mr. Gee beamed proudly . " Five years ago at twice that range he would have charged every time . There 's your proof of the effect of protection . " In the next two hours we saw nine more rhinos , nor did we ever know from one moment to another what else would erupt from the tall grass . Splashing along , our mounts flushed deer , wild pigs , swamp partridge with their young , water birds , and many smaller creatures . Tiger Fells a Water Buffalo At one point near the stream a patch of flattened grass revealed a trail leading up the ridge where something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carcass of a water buffalo , freshly killed by a tiger . Dragging a full-grown buffalo more than a hundred yards uphill was striking evidence of the big cat 's strength . The kill was too recent for comfort . Our mahouts turned the elephants and , continually glancing over their shoulders . looked much relieved when we left the area behind us . As has happened in many other parts of the world , water hyacinths have invaded the inner areas of the sanctuary ; the beautiful blue flowers clog many of the streams and bils . Where they were thick , passage became impossible . To cross the open areas , gaddi and passengers were delicately balanced in a long , narrow dugout canoe , which was poled across the water ahead of the elephants . The big animals seemed to enjoy the swim , following with only a small part of their heads and * See " Antlered Majesties of Many Lands , " 23 paintings by Walter A.

I had been hoping for a look at India 's wild buffalo , relative of both the tame buffalo found throughout this part of Asia and the not-so-tame African buffalo prized by hunters . So far all those we had seen were domestic . Unfortunately , the villagers ' animals are permitted to graze in the sanctuary , and diseases carried by them , including anthrax . have a disastrous effect , not only on their wild cousins but also on the deer , elephants . and , most important , the rhinos . " There are your wild buffalo , " Mr. Gee said quietly , as we emerged from a 15-foot wall of grass . Mohan stopped ; across a bil we counted 32 of the animals nervously watching us . In front of them stood a great bull with horns curving far out and back . He snorted , and , in a sudden confusion of rolling backs and waving grass . the entire herd disappeared . I returned later in the week for a closer study of the sanctuary area . One morning I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of Akbar . With an Assamese forester , who rode a smaller tusker , I had been looking over a remote area newly added to the sanctuary . In the infrequent openings we had seen hog deer , swamp deer , wild pig , and sambar , as well as three big rhinos ? two of them females with their severalhundred-pound babies beside them ( page 394 ) . Face to Face with an Angry Rhino As we headed home , the elephants striding along parted the towering grass with powerful sweeps of their trunks . Unexpectedly we burst into a small open space . Both elephants stopped dead . In the middle of the clearing a few yards away lay a young rhino .

The Author Chose a Dugout to Keep Dry Unlike the African rhinoceros , which uses his horn as a weapon , the great Indian rhino relies mainly on the enlarged incisors in his lower jaw , and in fighting apparently bites and swings his head to scoop with them . When we returned to the sanctuary , I measured the height of Sher Khan 's wound . It was a full seven feet above the ground !

He was still dripping and clean ? unusually so , as the animals normally are caked with steel-gray mud from their wallows . He carried fresh gashes on his neck , shoulders , side , and hind leg . When we rode up , he paid little attention to us . With most wild animals , when an old male has been defeated , he becomes an outcast , a danger to both man and beast . But when an aging rhino is driven away by its fellows , it may take up a new residence near people . become extremely docile , and live peaceably in its wallows , bothering nobody . There have been several such instances at Kaziranga , the most celebrated of these living in that state for more than 14 years . On my last evening at the sanctuary I rode in after dark .
