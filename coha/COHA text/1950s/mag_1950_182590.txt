Ko-Ko : Well , a nice mess you 've got us into , with your nodding head . . . <P> Pooh-Bah : Merely corroborative detail , intended to give artistic verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative . <P> - The Mikado <P> In June 1947 , a private pilot named Kenneth Arnold told reporters a wonderful yarn . While flying alone over Washington 's Mount Rainier , he said , he had spotted nine round , shiny , mysterious objects . flipping and flashing along in the sky " like saucers . " Since then U.S. newspapers and magazines have credulously - or jokingly- printed hundreds of other stories about flying saucers , usually based on " reports of eyewitnesses . " The witnesses generally seemed to believe that flying saucers exist , that they were manufactured by the U.S. or Russia , or came from the outer reaches- maybe from Venus or Mars . <P> Last week , in cocktail bars from Boston to San Bernardino , true believers renewed their faith , for they had a notable recruit : David Lawrence 's U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news magazine with a reputation for sobriety and conservatism , U.S. News devoted three pages to a story and pictures headlined FLYING <P> SAUCERS - THE REAL STORY : U.S. BUILT <P> FIRST ONE IN 1942 . Gist of the account : as part of its guided-missile program , the Navy has developed a revolutionary type aircraft , a combination helicopter and jet plane capable of outflying any other ; it is this plane that is the flying saucer . <P> Later in the week , Editor Lawrence said the same thing in his sober , respected column in the New York Herald Tribune and 200 other newspapers . In a notable omission of a pertinent fact , Lawrence cited U.S. News as an authority , but neglected to mention that he publishes it . As another authority he quoted one Commander Robert Bright McLaughlin , U.S.N. , author of an article in the March issue of True , to the solemn effect that flying saucers are real . <P> The U.S. News story gave the flying-saucers-are-real thesis a big boost . It was put out over the air last week by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's worth " ) by Mutual 's Fulton Lewis Jr. ; it was the subject of a documentary , neither pro nor con , by CBS 's Edward R. Murrow . Columnist Robert Ruark declared that " I believe . . . " Henry Holt announced a " serious " book on flying saucers by Variety 's Columnist Frank Scully . The Herald Trib , pooh-poohing the U.S. News article , concluded : " And yet-And yet there is something puzzling about the business . . . " <P> " Wild Statements . " What puzzled many Washington newsmen and officials was : How and why did the U.S. News fall for the flying-saucer story ? According to Managing Editor L. Noble Robinson , U.S. News " got the idea " for its story from Commander McLaughlin , the same man who wrote the True story . U.S. News did not talk to McLaughlin ( " He was out at sea " ) and did not quote him by name ; but the editors had evidently relied heavily on his reports . In port at Boston last week with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of " wild statements . "
