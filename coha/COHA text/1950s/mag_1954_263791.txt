The fear of fire in the nursery had long haunted Freda Holland . 41 , a night nurse at Reading 's Dellwood Maternity Home . 36 miles west of London . Early on Easter Sunday , it rose to grip her heart in panic as she opened the door behind which lay her newest charges : 15 babies , none more than nine days old . The room beyond was filled with smoke ; flames licked through the floor amid the cribs , and one baby 's bedding was already taking fire . Sister Holland screamed for help and rushed into the ward . Another nurse came to help , but they were both too late to save little Christopher Boulton , aged six hours , who lay in the smoldering bed . He died in Nurse Holland 's arms as she carried him from the room . <P> Trying to beat down the flames with her nurse 's cap , Sister Holland went on to pluck the other babies from their cribs , one by one , and hand them to Sister Margaret Thomas at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she collapsed . She was taken to Battle Hospital near by , where she lay in a coma while doctors did their best to graft new skin on her severely burned arms and face , and baskets of flowers from grateful parents were carried in . That night , in the same hospital , two of the rescued babies died from smoke poisoning . Two others died in Dellwood . Next day , despite desperate treatment with oxygen and penicillin , four more of the babies died . One by one , as the hours wore by and mothers prayed and doctors worked , the other victims of the smoke-filled night succumbed until only two were left . <P> At the end of the second day , Sister Freda Holland at last recovered consciousness , belittled her own injuries , and gave thanks that she had been able to save the children . For a full three days , there was no one in all of Reading who had the heart to tell her the truth .               @ @ @ @ @ @
