The booming state of California , Democratic Traveling Man John Fitzgerald Kennedy discovered last week , is a political hotel where beds are soft and the rates are right , but the manager doubles as house detective . Ranging from Sacramento to Los Angeles on a three-day visit , Presidential Hopeful Kennedy got such VIP honors as breakfast with Governor Edmund G. Brown and an invitation to address the legislature . But wherever Kennedy wandered , stern-eyed Detective Brown watched lest Kennedy set up an organization to slip into his valise any of California 's convention votes . Reason : " Pat " Brown himself has developed high ambitions about the 1960 convention , has announced as a favorite son and needs control of California 's delegation to keep his leverage . <P> Brown can scarcely be blamed for yearning . Touted as a do-little attorney general ( TIME , Sept. 15 ) before he swamped Republican William Fife Knowland for Governor last fall , Brown as Governor is doing a lot . He was barely in office before he forwarded a 30-bill liberal plan of action to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by request of Governor Brown . " Passed to date : Brown 's recommendations for a fair employment practices bill , curbs on installment buying to stop credit rackets , a measure ending California 's odd cross-filing primary system . <P> Still ahead , with Brown optimistic , are two major measures . One would raise $200 million in additional tax revenue ( including $60 million more in income taxes ) to help balance a $2 billion biennial budget . The other , equally basic : a development program calling for $1.13 billion initially to ease southern Califor nia 's water shortage by piping in northern California water . <P> Scare the Guests . As the bold Brown strategists see things , Brown must , as a minimum , keep the Golden State 's massive delegation in hand until the right candidate comes along , or until Brown can dicker for the vice-presidential nomination . But when they let their dreams balloon , they note that 1 ) the Democratic convention will be in Los Angeles , Brown 's front yard , 2 ) the Democratic convention is threatened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President ? Brown has agreed that he would accept a draft . <P> From their rose-tinted window on the West , Brown 's lieutenants see their rivals thus : <P> Massachusetts ' Kennedy is ahead . He is confident of winning primaries in Wisconsin and Oregon , but is loath to tangle in California unless he must . On the other hand , there is no room on Roman Catholic Jack Kennedy 's ticket for Catholic Brown . In Los Angeles last week Kennedy pooh-poohed the notion that he would oppose a favorite son . But Kennedy is aware that he will have to win the nomination early to win at all , may be tempted to change his mind , and go after California 's 76 votes . <P> Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey , who checked into the Brown hotel fortnight ago . Humphrey visited long enough to portray himself as the only Fair-Dealing , New-Dealing Democrat available . He left with good wishes and the suspicion that he could get California support when and if Pat Brown steps aside .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
