NOVEMBER 9 , 1953 Eisenhower and the Forty Farmers Who were the forty men who convinced Ike that farmers are " taking it in their stride " ? by Kenneth S. Davis A CABINET officer had just said that the politicians were more concerned with the farm situation than the farmers were . The President himself had just returned from a visit to the farm belt . Did the Presi ? dent 's impressions agree with the Cabinet officer 's ? Ray Scherer of NBC asked the question , about halfway through the President 's press conference of October 21 in Washington , and Mr. Eisenhower seemed to realize that it might be loaded as well as leading . According to the official transcript ( always written in third person when quoting the President ) , Mr. Eisenhower " would say that he thought the cattlemen and farmers were tak ? ing this more in their stride and , after all , he had in his little home town of Abilene had lunch with 40 people most of whom , if they were not farmers themselves , owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there had been no reason for them holding back anything they wanted to say ; and his impression was they were not as concerned as some of the people that came to his office. - That Mr. Eisenhower 's " impression " was correct , no one is likely to doubt who reviews with a knowing eye the guest list for that famous luncheon . Certainly the list is worth examining , now that the President of the United States has called our attention to it and indicated that its members may have influenced his judgment of the farm situation . The first thing that strikes the eye is that 15 of the " invited guests " were members of the President 's staff or dignitaries who accompanied him to Abilene from Kansas City . These included L. C. Hall , Kansas City greeting card ( Hallmark ) manufacturer and trustee of the Eisenhower Foundation ; former US Sen. Harry Darby , Kansas City industrialist ; Governor Edward F. Arn of Kansas ; Sen. Frank Carlson of Kansas ( who 10 days later was attacking Ezra Taft Benson 's plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas Congressmen , Rep. Ed Rees of Kansas City and Rep. Wint Smith of Mankato . Of the remaining 25 guests , not one can be classified as an actual farmer . Several can be classed as million ? aires or nearly so . These include the host , Sam R. Heller , in whose fine home on West Third Street the luncheon was served . Mr. Heller is president of the United Trust Company of Abilene and president of the A. L. Duck-wall variety stores , of which there are 52 in a far-flung and exceedingly prosperous chain . Mr. Heller is also president of the Eisenhower Foundation . He owns some farms . T. L. Welsh , one of the guests , is reputed by his Abilene neighbors to be worth some $3 million . He owns controlling interests in the big Abilene Flour Mills , the Midwest Mill ( a feed mill ) , and the Security Mills ( a flour mill not now operating ) . He has a finger in every sizable financial pie in Abilene and in a wide variety of businesses elsewhere . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth some $300,000 , according to one of his friends , and a Hereford farm for which he has been known to buy $10,000 bulls . Of approximately equal financial stature are L. C. Long and C. A. Case , both of whom were guests , both of whom own farms . Mr. Long is president of the Long Invest ? ment Company of Abilene and vice-president of the Financial Industrial Fund ( a securities investment firm ) in Denver , owning a controlling interest in both , while Mr. Case is president of the Abilene National Bank and inherited from his family a great deal of real estate and other property . And so it goes down the list of 40 men who gave the President the true picture of how farmers are feeling . Reputed by their neighbors to be worth several hundred thousand dollars apiece are E. S. Graham , president of the Home Securities Finance Company ; 0 . B. Landes of the Shockey-Landes hardware and furniture store ; R. B. Laing , milling company executive ( Mr. Welsh 's right-hand man ) ; Gordon A. Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator ; R. 0 . Gemmill of the Howard-Gemmill Insurance Company ; H. W. Rohrer , retired , telephone company executive ; C. M. Harger , 80-odd-year-old publisher of the Abilene daily newspaper , the Reflector-Chronicle ; Will Sterl of the Sterl , Clothing Store ; J. L. Lehman , attorney ; Paul H. Royer , attorney ; and W. L. Chain , a former mill owner , now retired , who is said to have sold out his interests to Mr. Welsh for a half million several years ago . It 's true that several if not most of these men own farms in their own right . Others on the list were invited because they were boy ? hood friends of the President . These include Joner Calla ? han , whose soft drink parlor is famed as Ike 's favorite hangout in his old home town ; Carl Nicolay , newly ap ? pointed Abilene city manager , who was on the high school football team with Ike ; and Howard Funk , who was also a football teammate and who , alone among all who were present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. and Mrs. Ray Etherington were invited be ? cause she is a first cousin of the President ; they 've in ? herited a considerable farm property from Mr. and Mrs. C. 0 . Musser ( Mrs. Musser was Ike 's Aunt Amanda ) and lived on a former Musser farm east of Abilene , but Mr. Etherington 's main business is life insurance . Ralyn Hill was invited because he was one of two Kansas men to win a Congressional Medal of Honor in World War I. Mr. Hill lives on a farm near Abilene , but he does n't farm ; he 's a rural mail carrier . Mrs. Roy Eisenhower , widow of the President 's brother , who was a druggist in neighboring Junction City , was also present , and so was Mrs. Giles ( Ruth Harger ) Maxwell , daughter of the publisher . While luncheon was consumed ? it included creamed turkey , sliced cold ham , sweet potato balls , hot rolls , dessert and coffee -- there was much chaffing and hearty good fellowship . There was no serious talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance for any . BILENE citizens know this , of course , and while they are quick with excuses for their famous fellow towns man ( they voted for him , 2,873 to 360 in 1952 ) there were raised eyebrows and ironic comments in Callahan 's place when press and radio reported the Presi ? dent 's remark about the relative lack of concern over the farm situation on the part of his luncheon companions . Joner Callahan himself grins wryly and shakes his head when the statement is mentioned , admitting that his old friend " slipped a bit on that one , - Almost every local citizen expresses sympathy for a man whose every remark is liable to hostile and searching scrutiny , but there are some who will tell a sympathetic ear that Ike 's little " slip , " in this case , is all-too-revealing of what 's wrong with his Administration . He listens too much to the fat boys , these covert critics say , and he mistakes the fat boys for the people . At least one highly intelligent citizen is persuaded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex ? ample " of a distressing facility for self-deception which , in turn , enables him to practice gross deception on the public with all the earnestness of a moral " crusade . " Analyze that remark and you 'll not find anything in it that is n't true in itself this citizen explained , after studying the verbatim transcript . It 's just the total effect that 's false . He did n't say that most of these " 40 people " were farmers . He said " if they were n't farmers themselves , " they " owned farms " and that might be literally true . It 's like his statement that he 'd go to Korea , or that the farmer ought to have 100 percent of parity . He did n't promise in so many words to end the war , or say that he favored supporting farm prices at 100 percent of parity . He just gave that impression . I tell you that man is a genius at giving false impressions . Such acid comments are more frequent and open in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dickinson County ? Eisenhower 's home county ? there 's a marked decrease of eagerness to excuse the President personally for the mistakes of his Adminis ? tration . If you talk with a dozen or so local farmers , ( which at least is more than the President did ) you gather that , despite local pride in him , Ike is slipping badly with the farm folks at home . One of these farmers was F. L. Chase , who lives three miles southwest of Abilene , owns 280 acres , and has 20 head of cattle . He is outspoken in his criticism both of Secretary of Agriculture Benson and of Mr. Eisenhower , and is convinced that he voices a sentiment widely pre ? vailing among his neighbors . The farmers " do n't want handouts , just a square deal , " he says , and he 's convinced that live cattle prices must be supported when everything else is . That price supports are a device for " bailing out " the farmer , as Mr. Benson is reported to have said , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the Administration 's notorious coddling of busi ? ness interests . Clyde Stevens , a half-mile south of Chase , believes Mr. Eisenhower , who carried Dickinson County 4 to 1 ( exclusive of Abilene which he carried 8 to 1 ) would have difficulty carrying the county 's farm vote if the election were held right now . The hostility toward Secretary Benson is , in his opinion , intense , and it has been or is rapidly being transferred to the President himself as farm prices go down and the droi4h continues . Grant Engle , four miles southwest of Abilene , farms 480 acres , is a leader in the local Farm Bureau , a member of the Program Works Committee of the Kansas Farm Bureau , and a director or past director of the local REA co-operative . He himself . believes that farmers should wait until Secretary Benson has developed his program before making up their minds about him ? but he con ? fesses that , in his travels over 10 counties in connection with his state office and in his frequent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decided shift of sentiment away from the Administration . He 's con ? vinced that Mr. Eisenhower could still carry Dickinson County , but that his majority would be much smaller than it was in 1952 . Engle echoed sentiments expressed by others when he said that farmers resent Mr. Benson 's " bailing out " re ? marks , are angered by such statements as Mr. Benson 's to the effect that " farmers have priced themselves out of the market on butter " ( as though the farmer could ac NOVEMBER 9 , 1953 tually control that price ) , and are outraged in steadily growing numbers as the new federal power policies are explained to them by directors of their local REA co-ops . The general sentiment , in Engle 's opinion , is summed up in the question : " Why junk a program we 've had for 20 years , one which we helped to develop and which has worked pretty well ? " And he 's afraid that the Secretary of Agriculture 's recent protestations that he has no inten ? tion of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on deaf ears . Most farmers remain convinced that Mr. Benson is merely yielding to pressure , that if left to his own devices he 'd try to return agriculture to the " rugged individual ? ism " which he believes to be good for the farmers ' souls but which farmers know to be fatal to their pocketbooks . If there 's one thing that 's certain , in Engle 's opinion , it is that a " free market " for farm products of the kind Mr. Benson gives the impression of favoring is utterly im ? possible in a world of giant corporations . Other farmers , such as Ray Whitehair , who lives one and a half miles west of Abilene , feel that it 's unfair to criticize Mr. Eisenhower or Mr. Benson until they 've had a chance to " work things out . " They " inherited a ter ? rible mess and it 's going to take time to clean it up . " Such appeals to patience and goodwill are common , but of course they 're essentially negative ( - do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a support price system for cattle is almost impossible because of the variation in grades " ; " after all , the cattle market was falling before Ike got into office . " ) But there were heard no statements of firm , positive support of Administration policies from these Dickinson County farmers . Of course there must be many farmers who , if encountered , would have ex ? pressed such sentiments . Weeks Reynolds , though , who operates the Reynolds sales pavilion just west of Abilene , seems convinced that few farmers in the area are now strongly " for " the Eisenhower Administration . Every Friday , Reynolds holds a sale , and every Friday he hears the farmers " cus ? sing out " the Administration because the cattle market is " busted " and Mr. Benson wo n't do anything about it . Eisenhower is blamed , too , in less bitter terms . There 's so much of it that Reynolds gets " fed up . " He 's a highly vocal Democrat himself , and he has no aversion to reminding his customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , to take their medicine with better grace . The accuracy of these notes on the trend of political sentiment among the farmers of Mr. Eisenhower 's home county seems confirmed , to some extent , by the annual meeting of the Dickinson County Farm Bureau Associa ? tion , held in Abilene just a week after the President 's visit . The local paper called the meeting a " fairly rep ? resentative cross-section " of the county 's farmers , and to it was presented a formal question : " Which do you prefer in a Farm Program , ( a ) 90 percent of parity ; ( b ) flex ? ible sliding scales of from 90 to 75 percent of parity ; ( c ) a two-price system ? " Secretary Benson is known to favor ( b ) , and there has been considerable talk in his Department that is favorable to ( c ) . Dickinson County 's farmers , however , voted overwhelmingly for rigid price supports at 90 percent of parity . Of the 160 votes cast , 114 favored 90 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored the sliding scale . The farm ? ers also voted overwhelmingly in favor of more federal financial aid in the establishment of soil-conservation programs on their land . Equally significant of the trend , though not confined to Dickinson County , was the annual meeting of 150 directors and managers of 37 Kansas electric co-opera ? tives , held in Abilene 's leading hotel just 10 days after the President 's visit . These men have influence over the thinking of thousands of electric co-op members , and they adopted three resolutions : 1 . To ask the support and co-operation of existing power suppliers in getting for Kansas the advan ? tages of large-scale power developed in neighbor ? ing states . 2 . To recommend that the three other Kansas power areas approve and join in an effort to restore Kansas to the federal power marketing areas . 3 . To protest the Department of Interior directives of September 10 , 1953 , which " for all practical purposes destroy the preference rights of munici ? pal and co-operative systems and reverse the power policies which have guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pentagon Shapes a New Plan by Frank Gorrell THE VISIT of Admiral Arthur Radford , Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , is regarded in Paris as the most important visit to Europe of an Amer ? ican military leader since General Eisenhower crossed the channel in wartime . Europeans know that the Eisenhower Administration has been engaged in a basic review of US strategy . They have not been told , but they can further guess that pressure for a revision in strategy is mounting in the US as the result of five major developments . First , while the demands upon France to ratify the European Defense Community agreement have been intense following the victory of Chancellor Adenauer , the European army is all but moribund . Second , NATO has stalled at the halfway point in its objective of 50 divisions in being , and without these divisions , NATO 's plan for holding the Russians at Europe 's Eastern frontiers is in limbo .

A choice between reluctant France and willing and in ? dustrious Germany seems imminent to some American leaders . Fourth , the Russians have steadily built their air forces in the West and now are constructing rocket platforms for guided missiles around Europe . They can quickly establish command of the air over Europe in wartime , making the reinforcement and supply of European armies next to impossible . Fifth , the US is " running out of the ears " with atomic bombs . The immensity of the atomic stockpile and the cost of a dual defense system , of atomic and conven ? tional weapons , is leading Eisenhower 's civilian ad ? visers to challenge the concept of limited , conventional warfare and to base American military strategy on the assumption that future wars will be all-out atomic wars . This last conclusion is not shared by the Joint Chiefs : It is the product of the amateurs , principally Defense Secretary Wilson , and his deputy Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural assumption of industrialists that any machinery installed in a fac ? tory 10 years or more ago is out of date and should be thrown away . Their central , driving motive is not the defense of the free nations but the reduction of Amer ? ica 's military budget . They are searching for military miracles as a cheap way out . They began by cutting back the air force , Now they suspect that they have found the magic answer in the air force and the A-Bomb . The professionals in the Joint Chiefs of Staff of course disagree , but the pressure to economize is on . It takes primarily the form of reducing the six American divi ? sions now in Europe . These forces might be withdrawn as part of a bargain by which Russian troops were also
