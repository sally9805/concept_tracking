txt NEW DELHI , India , Nov. 14 ? Four Asian Prime Ministers fenounced tonight the attacks against Egypt and Hungary . But for the most part the Asian Leaders used considerably harsher language against Britain and France than against the Soviet Union , The Prime Ministers of India , Indonesia , Burma and Ceylon issued a six-page communique at the close of their three-day meeting . For all its relatively cautious , wording about the Soviet Union , the communiqu ? Is not one that would make happy reading in Moscow . The most significant fact was that the four Asian countries , newly come to independence , criticized the . Soviet ' Union , which has been presenting itself to Asia as a champion of freedom and nationalism . But it remains a fact that the Russians got off more lightly in the communiqu ? than the Braid ' or French . The statement de . nounged Britain and France as " aggressor countries . " ' That // phrase was not applied to the Soviet Union . The communiqu ? demanded implementation " forthwith " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which calls for the withdrawal of foreign forces . The United Nations resolution calling for the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Hungary was not mentioned , but the Prime Ministers said those forces should be removed " speedily . " By and large the communiqu ? reflected the influence of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India . Mr. Nehru deplores the Soviet intervention in Hungary , but he has been more vehement about the Egyptian case . Mr. Nehru feels that the process of liberalization in Hungary was going too fast and too violently even before the Russians came in . He believes that speed and violence obstructed the process . The communiqu ? gave that view . The Burmese , more than the three other delegations , seemed to have been outraged by the case of Hungary . Last week U Ba Swe , , Burmese Premier , called the Soviet attack an example of brutal colonialism . The communiqu ? used no such language about the Russians , but ' did denounce all forms of colonialism . Throughout the communiqu ? ran a fear shared by all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big powers once again were getting in the habit of imposing their will by force ' on the smaller countries . The joint statement implied several times that that fear applied to the Russians as well as to Western powers . Dealing with Egypt , the Prime Ministers disapproved of any , conditions that might be laid down by the " aggressor countries " concerning the withdrawal of their forces . The Asian leaders approved the creation of a " temporary " United Nations , The four leaders met for a total of about eight hours during the three-day conference . The main result was the joint statement . The signers of the communiqu ? were Mr. Nehru , U Ba Swe , Dr. Ali Sastroamidjojo of Indonesia and S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike of Ceylon . Pakistan was invited but did not attend . Dealing with Hungary , the Prime Ministers said the violence " used on all sides " had resulted in thousands of deaths . They said they regretted the fact that Soviet forces were " reintroduced " into Budapest . " The Prime Ministers ccnsider it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own destiny , free from all external pressures , " said the statement . " They are of the opinion that the Soviet forces should be withdrawn speedily and that the Hungarian people should be left free to decide their own future and the form of government they will have without external intervention from any quarter . " The Prime Ministers warned that the world was faced with a new upsurge in the use of force . They said they were determined to resist " any resurgence of colonialism , whatever form it may take . " The question of India 's negative vote on the United Nations resolution ' on Hungary was raised todry on the floor of Parliament . Shortly after Parliament opened its fourteenth session H. V. Kamath , Praja ( People 's ) Socialist party leader , demander an immediate debate on the Indian vote .
