txt Charlie Dressen , who guided ' Brooklyn to two consecutive National League pennants after having narrowly missed one in his first season in charge , will not manage the Dodgers next year . The 55-year-old pilot abdicated his post , one of the best in base- , ball , when as a matter of policy ! the Brooklyn club refused to offer move than a one-year contract , ' with a rise in pay , for 1954 . He had demanded a three-year con-1 tract but would have settled for a two-year agreement . This startling baseball news broke yesterday morning at a press conference called , it had been generally supposed , to announce , the signing of Dressen for next season . With a subdued Dressen at his elbow , Walter F. O'Malley , president of the Brooklyn club , dropped the bombshell in the first moment of the proceedings at the Dodger 215:14outagua Street . " The Brooklyn Dodgers will have ' a new manager next year , " he said . " I met with Charlie late yesterday afternoon and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " O'Malley continued , " Charlie understands we will not deviate from our policy of one-year contracts and that we will not give ' him a contract for a longer period . " He will leave us with the deep personal affection of this organization . I do n't know what the future holds for Charlie but at no time ) has the front office been dissatisfied with him . No one has worked harder or put in longer hours . He has done a great job . " The Brooklyn president made it clear that the length of the contract was the only point of disagreement with Dressen and said that the Dodger door was still open to Charlie if he should change his mind .

' In fact , we 'll hold things open for a few days while he thrashes this out , although in fairness to coaches and other people you ca n't let a matter like this hang for too long . " In the meantime , Charlie has my permission to contact any club he desires for a new job . His contract does not expire until the end of the year but I 'll waive that and pay him off if that 's what he wants . " Mrs. Dressen in Hospital While firmly declining to sign the proffered one-year contract on the spot , Dressen did say he would talk over the situation with his wife , an enthusiastic supporter of his efforts to get a longer-term contract . Mrs. Dressen is in Long Island College Hospital undergoing tests for an intestinal ailment . However , Brooklyn officials will be surprised if Dressen backs down from his position and are resigned to having a new manager at Ebbets Field next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens a whole new field of speculation . Early attention centers on Pee Wee Reese , the club 's brilliant shortstop and captain . Those close to Dressen have been aware that getting a long-term contract developed into an obsession with him this season , more as a matter of appreciation , perhaps , than of job security . " I certainly feel I deserve a longer-term contract , " he said , leaving no doubt of his bitterness over the situation . " I asked for a three-year contract but I 'd be willingto settle for two . But they wo n't compromise and I 'm certainly not going to sign for one year . " Why should I ? " he went on . " Look at all those other guys . Leo Durocher took a contender , finished fifth and got a two-year contract . Eddie Stanky finished fourth and got a three-year contract . I won two straight pennants , something no other manager ever did in Brooklyn , and they want me to sign for one year . " After my first year , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of ridicule and the next season , too , stories kept , popping up about people getting , my job . So this year I made up my ' mind to hold out for a longer contract to hush up all that talk . " " I do n't know what I 'll do now , " said Dressen . " After all , there 's no other managerial job open- in the majors unless it 's at Baltimore . Maybe I ought to call them up and find out if they 'd be interested in me . Long Letter to O'Malley " Right now , though , my first concern is the illness of my wife . Ruth and I are in this together . The two of us sat down after we clinched the pennant and wrote a long letter to Mr. O'Malley explaining our feelings and stating our position . There may have been a paragraph in there that was pretty strong , but I 'm not going to second-guess my wife . Neither Dressen nor O'Malley would reveal the contents of the letter . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Brooklyn president , " I gave it back to Charlie after I had read it and made sure ' no one in our office made a copy of it . It 's not something I would like to have kicking around in our Salary was not a factor in Dressel  --  s failure to come to terms with ** both men confirmed . It was learned on good authority that , Charlie was offered $42,500 , $7,500 more than he received this year . " If Charlie signs with us he will receive more money than any Dodger player , more than the president of the corporation and more than any stockholder in the organization , " was all that O'Malley would say . " I can appreciate Charlie 's point of view on a long-term contract . Many other clubs seem to be giving them these days and it 's a matter of keeping up with the Joneses . But our policy is against them , and I like that policy . In fact , I 'd make that our policy if it were different . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've paid ) more money to more managers for ' not managing than has any clubl in the major leagues , " O'Malley pointed out . Casey Stengel and Burleigh Grimes are among those who drew Dodger pay on long .. elm contracts after being dismissed as manager . In his three years at Brooklyn , Dressen compiled the best record ever achieved by a Dodger mana- ; er . His 1951 team , beaten for the pennant in the finale of a three-game play-off with the Giants , won 97 games and lost 60 . His 1952 team had a 96-57 mark and during the last campaign the Dodgers reached a high of 105 victories against 49 defeats . Rankled by Series Losses It rankled Dressen personally and Brooklyn fans , too , that both in 1952 and this year . the Dodgers lost to the Yankees in the world , series . However , O'Malley maintained , that Brooklyn 's world series failures made no difference to him on the contract issue . " Even if we had beaten the Yankees , I would only have offered Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were a psychologist , though , I would say that the world series made a lot of difference to Charlie , " O'Malley continued . " He 's become more sensitive to criticism in a job where he needs to have the hide of an elephant . " The last case of a pennant-winning manager being let out before the start of a new season occurred in 1926 , when Rogers Hornsby , then with the Cardinals , got into a disagreement during the winter with Sam Breadon , the St. , Louis president . and was traded to the Giants for Frankie Frisch and Jimmy Ring . Frisch and Hornsby , incidentally , are among the " at-liberty " managers available to the Dodgers if they look outside of their organization for a new pilot . At this ' stage of the situation , however , the Dodgers have " absolutely no one under consideration , " a club ! spokesman said .
