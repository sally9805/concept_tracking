Robert C. Lockwood , a 41-year-old Miami insurance adjuster , had tax troubles . The Internal Revenue Service claimed he owed $415.69 in back taxes . Lockwood insisted he owed nothing . The collectors put on the pressure , and Lockwood , like many another before him , buckled . He signed a waiver permitting the Government to attach his paycheck . Said he : " I just gave up . I 'm a little guy . I did n't figure I could fight the Government . " <P> No sooner had Robert Lockwood signed that waiver than he had more than tax troubles . He had wife troubles . Pretty Margaret Ann Lockwood , 28 , gathered up her children-Ren , 2 , and ten-month-old Robbie-and marched into the Miami tax collector 's office to demand return of her husband 's paycheck . Says she : " I told them Robbie had just got out of the hospital , where he was treated for acute anemia , and we needed the money for medicine . They would n't listen . They 're rather coldhearted and impersonal down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action : she planted herself in a chair and announced she would stay right there until the paycheck was returned . <P> The children did the rest . Daughter Ren , dipping into a box of raisins , managed to spill about half of them on the tax office floor , happily trampled them into a gooey mess . Son Robbie wet his diapers , and Margaret Lockwood calmly changed them , draping the reeking castoffs over a chair . <P> When lunchtime came , Mrs. Lockwood opened jars of baby food , arranged them on a clerk 's desk . The children dug in greedily , splattered strained apricots and sweet potatoes generously over a stack of tax reports . Robbie started to cough on his food , and a nerve-shredded clerk told Mrs. Lockwood not to let him choke . " Mind your own business , " she snapped . " It 's my baby , not yours . " <P> Next , Ren found a wastebasket and enthusiastically overturned it . A clerk spoke sharply to her and she started to scream . Baby Robbie thereupon joined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harried tax collector surrendered . Margaret Lockwood was told that her husband 's check had been released , and she could pick it up at his office . Bob Lockwood would have another chance to talk over the claims against him ; even if back taxes were actually due , they could be paid in small installments . And across the U.S. , tax collectors braced themselves for a tide of determined wives-with children .
