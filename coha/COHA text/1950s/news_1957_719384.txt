txt Mayor Wagner declared yesterday that he fully supported the Transit Authority in the subway strike . The inclusive nature of the Mayor 's assertion made it clear that he backed both the threat to discharge 300 of the estimated total of 500 striking motormen and also the authority 's refusal to sit down and seek to settle the issues ' in an " illegal " work stoppage . The Mayor 's declaration included an appeal to the strikers to return to work and cease their " illegal " actions . These actions , Mr. Wagner asserted , " have brought great hardship to the people of New York and are seriously affecting our economy .

MAYOR 'S STATEMENT The text . of Mayor Wagner 's statement follows : As Mayor of the City of New York , I would like to make a direct appeal to the individual employes of the transit system who are participating in the present strike which the courts have ruled illegal . Their illegal actions have brought great hardship to the people of the City of New York and are seriously affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own incomes and security . I am certain that the majority of those who have failed to report to work are not fully aware of the fact that they are breaking the law .

Both the people of the City of New York and the majority of the transit employes have shown patience and forbearance in this most difficult and trying situation .
