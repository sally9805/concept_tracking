For Yankee youth , Colonel Harry M. Ayers , publisher of the Anniston , Ala . Star , last week had a few words of advice : " Come south , young man . " Since World War II , Ayers pointed out tat the 27th anniversary of the founding of Wooster School in Danbury , Conn. , capital has been pouring into the South . Even so , said Ayers , " the South is still an undeveloped region . " Youth , said he , would discover , as Northern industry had , that in the South " competition is not so keen as it is in other regions , " and " condiditions are so much better and success much easier . "
