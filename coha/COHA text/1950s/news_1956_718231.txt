txt NEW DELHI , India , Sept. 11 ? India has informed the Western powers that Egypt would agree to international control ** prices for ship passage through the Suez Canal . Western diplomats here have been told by Indians that Cairo would allow the rates to be fixed by international agreement and that they could not be changed by Egypt alone . The phrase " international control " is assiduously avoided here , but that is what such a plan would amount to in respect to rates . The Indians have been putting forward this report of Cairo 's attitude as evidence that President Carnal Abdel Nasser is willing to negotiate . The Indians see their main job these days as getting negotiations resumed . But the British think that India has become so onesided in her approach that she has no real go-between function anymore . The Egyptians have said publicly . that the question of rates should be discussed by ? the international conference proposed by Cario . The Indians seem to feel that an advance agreement to abide by such rates is important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment would not touch the basic issue of international control over transit through the canal and international operation of the waterway . The West starts from the viewpoint that international control of the canal operation is possible even now . The Indians feel President Nasser will never agree . What New Delhi is interested in is trying to find out what agreements can be reached short of international operating control . The Indians are keenly interested in the question of rates . 1Seventy-one per cent of India 's imports and 60 per cent of her exports pass through the canal . Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , who yesterday denounced the West 's plan for a users ' association as carrying a grave risk of war , today took a new diplomatic step . He invited the representatives in India of the four countries  --  Pakistan , Indonesia , Burma and Ceylon  --  to meet with him tomorrow to discuss the Suez situation . India and the four other countries had a political conference in the capital of Ceylon in 1954 . Since then they have been known as the Colombo powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint " Colombo power approach " to Suez was planned . They said they did know Mr. Nehru wanted to keep the other Colombo powers fully ' briefed on the Suez crisis . Mr. , Nehru 's speech yesterday , criticizing Prime Minister Eden personally , has resulted in a sharp deterioration of Indian-British relations . The British now questions whether the Indians have left ' themselves a real role to play in , the Suez picture . They feel India ' has committed herself so firmly to Egypt and so harshly attacked Britain that she has re moved herself as a negotiator . This definite chilling came after the London conference on the Suez Canal at which the Indians ' presented a plan in opposition to the West 's . Before that Britain asked for  --  and received  --  India 's help in dealing with President Nasser . The British , even in their present iciness toward the Indans , give them . some credit for persuading President Nasser to talk with the Menzies mission of five nations chosen by the London conference . The British resent several things about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Prime Minister Eden had slammed the door against negotiations . Another was his charge that Britain and France had withdrawn pilots from the canal . They say this was not true . The third was his quick condemnation of the proposed users ' association on the basis of press stories . Usually , Mr. Nehru says , he refuses comment on the international crisis on the basis of press accounts . The British are not expected to be enthusiastic about the news that India has lent Egypt the rupee equivalent of $10,000,000 . A Government official said the money was lent by the Reserve Bank of India to help to continue a trade with Egypt . Cairo Sends Nehru Urgent Plea NEW DELHI , Sept. 14 GP ? Egypt sent India an urgent message tonight on the eve of a Suez Canal crisis conference of Southeast Asian envoys . The contents were not disclosed , but it was believed to he a plea to Prime Minister Nehru to take steps to forestall possible use of force by Britain and France . ( Ceylon 's Head May Go to Cairo Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 14-1 Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike is in close touch with Prime Minister Nehru , and there is a possibility that the Ceylonese and Indian leaders will fly to Cairo shortly to discuss the Suez issue with President Nasser . How Suez Rates Are Based The current Suez Canal transit rates are based on an arbitrary measurement known as a Suez ton . They amount to 97.6 cents a ton for a loaded ship and 44.5 cents a ton for an empty ship , The Suez ton is similar to but slightly smaller than the net ton as established by United States and British admeasurers . Net tonnage is a measure of the cubic contents of a ship 's revenue-earning space . One hundred cubic feet is the standard accommodation for one ton of goods . Net tonnage is obtained by deducting from gross tonnage the passenger and crew accommodations and spaces such as the bridge , captain 's quarters , chartroom , capstan and anchor gear room , boatswain stores and water ballast tanks . For instance , the superliner United States ' is measured at 53,329 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her owners would pay on the latter figure .
