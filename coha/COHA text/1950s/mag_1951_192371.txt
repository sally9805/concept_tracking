On the prowl for fresh backgrounds at low cost , U.S. independent moviemakers have lately been shooting pictures abroad , with a U.S. star or two for box-office bait . Two samples : <P> Circle of Danger ( Joan Harrison ; United Artists ) sets Ray Milland down in Britain as an American who suspects that his brother 's wartime death in a Commando raid was really the result of foul play . Milland 's hunt for the killer takes him to the Welsh coal pits , the highlands of Scotland , the English countryside , the streets of London . The tour has genuine atmosphere , but the story lacks pace and imagination , and gains no lift from Mil-land 's romantic side trip with Britain 's Patricia Roc . <P> Three Steps North ( W. Lee Wilder ; United Artists ) wastes not only up &; coming Lloyd Bridges and its Italian backgrounds and supporting cast ( Lea Padovani , Aldo Fabrizi ) , but also a promising melodramatic idea . Bridges is an ex-G.I. who has served time for black-marketeering and goes back to dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the nearby town is full of schemers trying to trip Bridges up for reasons of their own . They thicken the plot with so much intrigue that it curdles into the kind of confusion best followed with a score card listing names and numbers of all the actors .
