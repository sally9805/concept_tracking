One day , when the President was riding with General Bradley and me , he fell to discussing the future of some of our war leaders . I told him that I had no ambition except to retire to a quiet home and from there do what little I could to help our people understand some of the great changes the war had brought to the world and the inescapable responsibilities that would devolve upon us all as a result of those changes . I shall never forget the President 's answer . Up to that time , I had met him casually on only two or three occasions . Now , in the car , he suddenly turned toward me and said : " General , there is nothing that you may want that I wo n't try to help you get . That definitely and specifically includes the presidency in 1048 . " <P> I doubt that any soldier of our country was ever so suddenly struck in his emotional vitals by a President with such an apparently sincere and certainly astounding proposition as this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions had previously been made to me about a possible political career . My reaction was always instant repudiation , but to have the President suddenly throw this broadside into me left me no recourse except to treat it as a very splendid joke , which I hoped it was . I laughed heartily and said : " Mr. President , I do n't know who will be your opponent for the presidency , but it will not be I. " There was no doubt about my seriousness . - Dwight Eisenhower , Crusade in Europe <P> Rolling into New York state last week , Harry Truman wound up two weeks of whistle-stopping during which he had done his demagogic best to insure that Dwight Eisenhower should not get the presidency in 1952 . A sampler of Tru-manisms : <P> " The special interest fellows who run the Republican Party are so anxious to get control of the Government . . . that they wo n't stop at anything . . . Eisenhower is doing and saying exactly what they tell him ... He has become a front man for the lobbies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling them a blunder , Eisenhower has raised questions that strike a blow at the morale of the free nations fighting there . I never thought I would see a general , least of all this one , doing anything that could weaken the morale and faith of our country ... at the very time when our troops are locked in battle with the enemy . " " He does n't know anything about most of the issues . " " He has betrayed his principles , and he has deserted his friends . " <P> At a press conference , six months before Ike 's nomination by the G.O.P. , Harry Truman warned that Ike would have to expect to have mud thrown at him if he got into politics . At the time the President made this statement , nobody realized that it was a personal threat .
