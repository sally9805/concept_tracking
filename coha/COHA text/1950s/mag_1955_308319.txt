MANNERS &; MORALS <P> In 1935 Joseph E. Davies , distinguished lawyer and socialite , crossed the Atlantic , walked into his wife 's suite in London 's Claridge 's Hotel . Mrs. Davies hurried forward affectionately to greet him , but Joe held her back with a dramatic gesture . " Emlen , " he intoned to his wife of 33 years , " I want my freedom . " She replied : " Why certainly , Joe . " Soon Emlen divorced Joe Davies . At about the same time , Marjorie Merriweather Post Close Hutton , the Post Toasties heiress , divorced Edward Hutton , her second husband ( the first : Edward Close ) . <P> The 1935 wedding of Joe and Marjorie Davies was a $100,000 affair in her 66-room Manhattan apartment . Everything was pink ; she gave the caterer a swatch from her wedding gown material , and he matched it perfectly in the cake icing . Marjorie was 48 and Joe was 59 . They embarked on a West Indies honeymoon cruise aboard her yacht , the Sea Cloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Freeze . F.D.R. appointed Joe Davies Ambassador to Moscow , a tour of duty ( 1936-38 ) which resulted in the second worst book ever written about Russia , * his bestselling , rose-spectacled , Mission to Moscow . <P> During the drab Moscow months Marjorie bore up bravely , fortified by the two tons of frozen food which she imported from the U.S. both to fill out her menus and to display American technical progress . ( The Russians were amazed that anyone would freeze food on purpose . ) Marjorie was delighted when Davies was transferred to Belgium as U.S. ambassador . " Thank God , " cried she . " It 's got a king . " <P> Back in Washington during the war years , Joe Davies became the oracle of Soviet-American friendship , and Marjorie gave some of the capital 's gaudiest parties at their 29-acre estate , Tregaron , where the hothouses sprouted 80 kinds of orchids . The Davies were a famous waltz team . But all idyls have an end . In 1950 , at 63 , Marjorie took up square dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last summer Marjorie rented an English castle without Joe , but came back to Tregaron for a glittering round of parties . Then Marjorie , who had announced her departure on a world cruise , went instead last January to Sun Valley , Idaho . <P> Last week Marjorie , as well-preserved at 67 as a deep-frozen peach , appeared in an Idaho courtroom . Joe , she said , has " a funny lack of basic straight thinking that was awfully hard to live with . " Moreover , he was always accusing her of making passes at other men . Once , she declared , she leaned out of her box at Madison Square Garden to congratulate Industrialist Henry Kaiser for his speech to a war-bond rally . " I was kept up half the night wrangling over this - that I was making a pass at him Kaiser . " Joe put up no defense in the Idaho court , and the divorce was granted . <P> At week 's end , her maiden name restored , Marjorie Merriweather Post , as she now prefers to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Ambassador Hotel . Gossip columnists guessed that she might marry again - perhaps the hotel 's noble-born president , Serge Obolensky , who said he was flattered by the rumor but blamed it on the fact that he eats Post Toasties for breakfast .
