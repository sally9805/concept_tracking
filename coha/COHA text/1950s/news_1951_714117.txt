txt Some of the Washington prophets who have been giving precise predictions on how much more the public will pay for haircuts , and such other esoteric matters , are reportedly a little concerned lately for fear their figures might prove embarrassingly fanciful . Well , they may prove fanciful but there 's no reason for them to be embarrassed . Agriculture Department officials are reported working out a technique for avoiding that . Early this year the Bureau of Agricultural Economics put out an official estimate that everybody in the country was going to eat 148 pounds of . meat , a prediction that helped scare everybody about meat'shortage prospects . But unfortunately everybody has n't been acting like everybody was expected to , and now the B.A.E . is rather redfaced at the prospect that people are only going to eat about 140 pounds of meat apiece . This small error figures out to a misjudgment of about a billion pounds in the total consumption of meat , an error which is n't so small . However , the United Press reports that the B.A.E . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.P. , is to put out a series of revised predictions , each a bit smaller than the previous one ; until the billion pound error is gradually absorbed . The idea seems to be that the public would thus be gradually " conditioned " and so the early-season wild guess would pass unnoticed . Then nobody would/beef about it . That ought to be a popular technique . There seems to be a good bit of air in most of these precise prophecies from the economic stabilization agencies ; they blow hot or cold as the occasion warrants . But a technique that can obscure a billion pounds of meat ought to be able to take care of a few mislaid haircuts . Anyway , we suspect the public is already pretty well conditioned to rapid changes of temperature in Washington .
