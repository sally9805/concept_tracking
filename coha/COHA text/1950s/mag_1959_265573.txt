Abraham Joshua Twerski , 28 , graduated from medical school this week . It was no mean feat , for Twerski is a Jewish rabbi like his father , two uncles , father-in-law , two older brothers and ( when they finish their studies ) two younger twin brothers . And to keep the Torah as an Orthodox Jew for six years of studies in Milwaukee 's Roman Catholic Marquette University was something like running a sack race , an egg race and an army obstacle course at the same time . <P> First there was the problem of keeping his religion from growing rusty ; he rose each day at 5:30 a.m. , put in an hour 's study of the Talmud before early service at Milwaukee 's Beth Jehuda Synagogue , where he is assistant rabbi . Medical school classes began at 8 a.m. , and here real complications set in . His full , black beard was a sanitary problem in surgery , requiring special snood-like surgical masks . His tallith katan , a small prayer shawl worn by many Orthodox Jews under their shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - which might set off a static spark and ignite the anesthetic in an operating room . <P> Lectures on Saturday . Religious holidays sometimes required months of advance planning . The nine-day Feast of Tabernacles , for instance , with four days when work is forbidden , fell during a series of lectures before a make-or-break exam in pathology . Abe , as students and professors call him , met the situation by studying by himself all the preceding summer , put himself so far ahead of his class that he could afford to miss the lectures . " I hated like heck to miss them , " he explains , " but I creamed that exam . " <P> When lectures came on Saturdays-during which Orthodox Jews are forbidden to work , ride in a vehicle or talk on the phone-Abe would have a friend put a sheet of carbon paper under his lecture notes and hope he remembered to use a ballpoint pen . Sabbath restrictions begin on Friday night , just before sundown , and on occasional Fridays only a lucky break in the traffic has saved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the way home . On Saturdays Abe was not on duty , but sometimes , to follow up on one of the cases he had been observing , he would leave his car in the garage and walk five miles to the hospital and back . <P> Work on Tish ' ah Be'ab . Abe brought his own kosher food to school every day and ate it in the student lounge , where he also said his midday prayers in a corner , surrounded by chattering fellow students . Hospital duty during the 24-hour fast without food and water at Tish ' ah Be'ab ( commemorating the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 A.D. ) Dr. Twerski describes as " murder , ' ' and the last six years have left him hollow-eyed and slightly sallow . But he is eagerly looking forward to the next stage : a year of internship at Milwaukee 's Mount Sinai Hospital , followed by a three-year residency in psychiatry . <P> " Psychiatric training was the motivation for my going into medicine , " he says . " I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more help to them with their problems . "
