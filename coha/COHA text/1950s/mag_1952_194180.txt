One day early this year , Comedian Dave Garroway got up to go to work at 4 a.m. , and before the sun was well up , the television world was pretty well agreed on the morning 's work : Dave had laid an egg . He was launching a new TV newscast called Today ( weekdays , 7 a.m. , NBC ) , and he had almost no sponsors . But he had more communication gadgets-teletype machines , TV monitors , assorted dials , radio earphones , news films-than he knew what to do with . TV critics earnestly advised Dave Garroway , a nice fellow , to go back to being a funnyman . Dave grinned and went back to work on his new program . <P> By this week , nine months later , Gar-roway 's Today was the most popular daytime news program on TV and a rousing success . During July it had more TViewers than the afternoon telecasts of the presidential conventions . While most other daytime TV shows drooped from a lack of summertime sponsors , Today sold a hatful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's salary rose to a high of $5,000 a week . Yet nothing much has changed on the program . Garroway and his 35 co-workers have just grown more expert in handling their equipment , and have learned a few tricks about selling the news . Says Garroway : " Now we never say , ' Here 's something of interest to dog lovers . . . ' because then all the non-dog lovers leave us . We try to make the specific more general and the general more specific . " <P> The show opens with a five-minute news summary , followed by sport results , a nationwide weather rundown ( " People in New York seem to want to know whether it 's raining in Omaha " ) , and an interview with a guest who may be a fashion designer or a Connecticut tobacco grower . Finally , there is a twelve-minute news package delivered by Garroway , Jim Fleming and Jack Lescoulie ( " We have three commentators-no waiting " ) . The second hour of Today is pretty much a repeat of the first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is telecast to the later-rising Far West . When Today is over , Garroway hustles upstairs from his street-level TV studio to broadcast his 15-minute Dial Dave Garroway radio show . <P> Garroway used to like late hours . Now he beds down in his Park Avenue apartment by 8 each evening ( " It 's easy when you have to get up at 4 each morning " ) . He likes to think he has revolutionized the morning habits of a good part of the nation , as well as his own . " People write us that they 're eating breakfast in the living room next to the TV set instead of in the kitchen or dining room . Some even put their sets on rollers or rig up mirrors s.o they can keep an eye on the show while dressing . " He feels that his " national TV newspaper " may have an even greater sociological impact by cutting down on the nation 's divorce rate : " God knows that a lot of husbands watching the show are n't arguing with their wives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show like this might have saved my own marriage . "
