txt SPectal to The New York Tulles GENEVA , Monday , May ** table , square table , or lots of little tables , the United Nations officials here said stanchly this morning that they would be prepared for the foreign ministers ' conference . ' Much to the astonishment of the United Nations , the host at the meeting , tables have come to dominate tile news of the conference . Of course , everybody knows that it is not the shape of the table , or tables , but the principle of recognition of East Germany that counts . But still , early in the morning of the conference , the United Nations official hosts did not know what kind of arrangements to make for their highranking guests . Elements of a Nightmare It is a little like the nightmare of a hostess in which she dreams of ushering her guests with a flourish into an empty dining room . But , purposefully , the United Nations administrators say that the world organization will be ' ready for any emergency . The problem is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha ; lots and lots of small tables , which could be joined together in almost any pattern . The problem is earphones . The ; headsets for tile delegates have to be fixed into the table and that takes a little time . It also takes a lot of overtime , which is what the United Nations has to pay the Swiss electricians who have to stand by while the valid awaits the decision of the great battle of the tables . The battle of the tables began several days ago with the arrival of the advance parties . // The Russians want a round table  --  so that the delegates can shift about easily , they say . The West wants a square table ? one side to a delegation . The East German Communist diplomats ran into trouble in getting into the conference . They even had trouble getting into the press center , which has been open for days . While diplomats of the West and the Soviet Union were wrangling about the status of the East Germans , the Swiss officials at the press center wzre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delegations attending the conference are permitted to enter the press center . The East Germans are a delegation . The Swiss did not quarrel about that . However , they noted with meticulous correctness that until the foreign ministers had met and made a decision , no Germans , East or West , could be considered part of the attending delegations . The East Germans could not enter , but could peek inside and were free to buy newspapers in the outer lobby . Come to My Villa While the East Germans were having their troubles , Western newspaper men were having an easy time getting to talk with the Russians . At the villa on the hill where the Soviet delegation is working , there was just one Swiss policeman at the gate . After a while he found out that the Russians did not mind if newspaper men went in and introduced themselves . Time Out For Leisure " Work , " said Mr. Gromyko in his garden . " Work in Moscow , work in Geneva . " Many persons were working here today . Political officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearily waited for last-minute dictation . But the day was not exactly grim . Most persons had time for leisurely lunches on sunny restaurant terraces . Among them was Semyon K. Tsarapkin , Soviet Foreign Ministry official , who went for a walk later and dodged little boys and girls who raced up and down urging on wooden horses mounted on tricycles . " Work , work , " said Mr. Gromkyo , but in Geneva there were not many who seemed to feel downtrodden . Anyone Want to Meet ? The big meeting starts tomorrow , but this was the day of the little meetings . They sprouted all over town , in villas and restaurants . It was a pretty small diplomat who could not look at his watch , jump and rush off to some conference or other . There were various types of meetings : Liaison type  --  Representatives of the four major powers get ' together to iron out details of tomorrow 's conference , or at , least straighten out some wrinkles . Carpentry becomes a big issue . Will the conference table be square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . Will photographers be alloweeto shoot the opening moments of the conference ? Yes , but a wrangle about arrangements . Office space becomes a big issue . Will the Russians get the best press briefing room because they had it at the last conference ? Yes , after a wrangle . Will the East Germans and West Germans get briefing rooms . A wrangle , then yes . Maybe the big Big Four meetings will be better than the little Big Four meetings , people say . Strategy type  --  Western foreign ministers meet , go over the ground again , figure out how new developments  --  what Christian A. Herter , Secretary of State , discussed with Chancellor Konrad Adenauer  --  fit into the picture . Handshake type  --  British Foreign Secretary drives to Soviet villa . Photographers , desperate behind fances , take pictures of Russian secretaries playing ping-pong in the garden . Counterpart type ? Same team subdivision : East German specialist meets Russian specialist . British specialist meets American specialist . The object is to tell each other what is on their minds , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other fellows . Counterpart type , sparring division  --  On the terrace of a lakeside restaurant , a British diplomat motions over his shoulder . " Lunching with so and so , " he says . " My counterpart . Russian counterpart . " The formal object is to straighten out a few details , man to man , professional to professional . Who knows , maybe the other fellow will let something slip . No harm trying . Moment of Glory Successful or not , the foreign ministers ' conference will live forever in the memory of a pretty blond girl , who stepped off a train and found herself surrounded by diplomats and photographers . Everyone was startled for a moment . Then the girl found herself deserted as the crowd rushed fifty yards to greet Foreign Minister Hein ? rich von Bretano of West Germany , who was looking around for someone to say hello to . The girl marched off , alone , but looking quite pleased .                   @ @
