 | How to Be Cheated in 25 Words or Less M ore than fifty million dollars in cash and in oil wells , new homes , trips to the Riviera , automobiles , college scholarships , clothes , annuities , and kitchen appliances will be given away this year to lucky winners of sales-promotion contests who remembered to enclose the right box tops or soap wrappers with their twenty-five-word slogans , rhymed jingles , or puzzle solutions . Maybe you 've been thinking of trying your luck . If you do , take a bit of serious advice from the people who handle the judging of such big prize competitions . Make sure you write the required slogans or verses with no help from anybody outside your own family . And , above all , do n't fall for one of the " professional contest assistance services , " or contest ghostwriting agencies , that offer , for a substantial payment in advance , to supply you with specially prepared contestentry material . The directors of most nationally promoted contests will warn you that buying such " expertly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The contest-help people hold out glittering promises . " We provide everything you need to enter wonderful cash contests for a whole year ? your big chance for financial freedom , " one of the contest-help agencies advertises . " Our experienced professional writers select the right contests for you and compose the required slogans , statements , and last lines of limericks FOR YOU ALONE . No one but you receives your entries . You are legally permitted to call them YOUR OWN WORK . They are sent to you with mailing directions . For this wonderful privileged service , only $100 pays for everything . Fill out the attached coupon today and you 'll be in time to enter a big new contest that pays $100 a month for life . " Most of the contest-help agencies also give bargain rates as introductory come-ons : fifteen dollars for two entries or forty dollars for eight ghostwritten slogans or verses . They are careful not to make out-and-out firm promises that their entries will win , because , back in 1940 , the Federal Trade Commission cracked down on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But their advertisements give the impression that their ghostwritten compositions ca n't miss . and the companies that sponsor major contests receive many letters from disappointed contestants who had subscribed to a contest-help service because they 'd thought it was a sure thing . " The worst part of it , " one contest director says , " is that most of the people we hear from are poor families or families of very limited means , who actually deprived themselves of necessities in order to pay for these ghostwritten entries . " The advertisements of the contest-help services are filled with glowing testimonials from allegedly satisfied customers . ( " The name of the race horse you suggested won me $3,500 . " " Thank you for the essay that won me the first contest check I ever received . " " Please allow me to thank you kindly for the very fine composition you submitted to me . . . . It won for me . " ) But no names or home-town addresses are signed to the letters . As an experiment , a Good Housekeeping editor sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a coupon that promised her " three months ' membership to receive fifteen entries . " The acknowledgment guaranteed that all write-ups would be for her alone . Six months later , she had received only four entries , and two of the four were mimeographed " guess " answers to contests that required no writing or rhyming skill . During this period , her follow-up letters of inquiry were ignored , although she continued to receive mailings urging her to send more money and extend her membership . Most important , her ghostwritten entries have n't won her a cent . The big flaw in the whole scheme is that the rules of most major contests specifically forbid the contestant to seek help from anybody outside his family . And if 92  | you think such outside help can be easily concealed , you do n't know how carefully each entry in a contest is examined and judged ? and how painstakingly each possible winner is investigated before a prize is awarded him . As a matter of fact , the Reuben H. Donnelley Corporation , which handles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for a ghostwritten entry to become a winner . ig contests will attract anywhere from half a million to a million entries , sometimes even more . These entries are first examined by a staff of trained and experienced inspectors , who eliminate more than half because they simply are not good enough for future consideration . Most of the entries composed by professional contest ghost writers are quickly spotted and tossed aside during this preliminary inspection . " When you 've seen as many of those ghostwritten slogans as we have over the years , you can recognize most of them immediately , " a Donnelley man says . One further factor all but precludes the possibility of success for a ghostwritten entry . A contest sponsor must satisfy himself that a winning entry is the property of the person who submitted it . Otherwise , he could face the possibility of a lawsuit by the person who really wrote the material . So when the judging has narrowed the entries down to perhaps eight or ten candidates , each surviving contestant is checked , through a detective agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , a ghostwritten entry has survived , the detective who drops into the contestant 's neighborhood to have friendly talks with him and his family and friends is almost sure to find out about it . Usually , a contestant whose entry was written by somebody else does n't realize he has broken the contest 's rules and talks freely about it . A while ago , a detective visited a housewife in the Middle West who was in the running for a ten-thousand-dollar prize . Without dimulging that she was being considered for the big award , the detective asked her how she had written the slogan she had sent in . " Oh , I did n't write it myself , " she said , with a laugh . " I have a cousin who did it for me . She 's very good at that sort of thing . " The detective thanked her for the coffee she had served him , put on his hat , and left the house . The woman never knew why she had missed being a winner . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been required to sign an affidavit testifying , on sworn oath , that the submitted work had been performed without outside help . Incidentally , the Donnelley contest directors do not believe stories you may have heard about people who earn a prosperous , steady income simply by entering contests . " If there are such men and women who make a career out of competing for contest prizes , I think we 'd know about them , because we judge about eighty per cent of the major contests in the United States , " a Donnelley man says . " Big winners do n't win a lot of contests regularly , and I do n't think anybody makes , say , twenty-five thousand dollars a year regularly by winning a few thousand dollars steadily every month . If a man wins that much in a year , he probably hit one big prize , for fifteen or twenty thousand dollars , and a couple of small ones ? and his chances of earning that much money again the following year are certainly very slim . " Sponsors say the magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win " articles and the contest schools that offer correspondence courses on writing slogans and rhyming techniques are not illegal because they do not help contestants with the actual preparation of submitted material . But do n't make the mistake of thinking that special study or training will automatically make you a big money winner . And , most serious of all , do n't fall for the fool 's paradise promised by contest . help services . Getting such help is practically the one sure way to be a guaranteed loser ! 93
