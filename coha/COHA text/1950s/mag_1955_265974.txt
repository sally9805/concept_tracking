As the undisputed boss of the World-Herald , Omaha 's only daily ( circ. 254,467 ) , Henry Doorly has long had a bedrock maxim for publishing his paper . " You ca n't look for popularity , if you 're an independent paper , " says he , " because you 're constantly stepping on someone 's toes . When you 're alone it 's doubly difficult to please everyone . " <P> A severe , conservatively dressed and conservative-minded publisher , Doorly has never been guilty of trying to please everyone , but he has reached many . In Omaha the World-Herald goes to almost every home in the city ; across Nebraska , three out of five families take it . For the past 15 years the paper has not supported a single Democrat for state or federal office , and Nebraskans have elected only two . The paper packs an even greater non-political punch . After a World-Herald crusade for traffic safety in 1953 , the state 's death toll dropped 30% in four months , while surrounding states ' tolls continued to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a few ) know it is a power to be reckoned with . Says one state Democrat grudgingly : " It does cover everything . " <P> Dollars &; Items . The man responsible for the paper 's commanding power is Doorly himself . He has left his indelible imprint on the World-Herald since the day he arrived 52 years ago . Born in Barbados , he went to Omaha as a Union Pacific draftsman and married Margaret <P> Hitchcock , daughter of the paper 's founder . Democratic U.S. Senator Gilbert M. Hitchcock . He started out as a $25-a-week reporter ( and got a $2.50 raise when he married the boss 's daughter ) ; he quickly switched to the classified-ad department when he found that " I was not so hot as a reporter . " Doorly moved up on the business side , put the World-Herald solidly in the black ( and on the Republican side ) and made it one of the most profitable , strongly entrenched dailies in the country . In 1928 William Randolph Hearst took over the Omaha Bee-News , challenged Doorly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years Hearst had to sell out to Doorly , after having put more than $6,000,000 into the fight . <P> Doorly built the World-Herald by watching the paper 's news coverage as closely as he watched its finances . To enforce brevity and variety , he ordered an " Item Count " every day , totting up the number of stories in each news category ( i.e. , local news , society , international , etc. ) , made the staff produce as many as 450 separate news stories a day . If a close personal friend or a big advertiser got in the way of one of the paper 's local crusades , Doorly had no compunction about running him over . When he decided in 1939 that the New York-controlled Nebraska Power Co. should be a locally owned public utility , he broke with some of his biggest advertisers and closest friends , and won his goal .
