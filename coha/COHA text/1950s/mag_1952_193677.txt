NAPOLEON AT ST . HELENA ( 318 pp. ) - The Journals of General Bertrand , January-May , 1821-Doubleday ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> " The finest piece of work since the Romans , " said Napoleon of General Henri-Gatien Bertrand 's bridging of the Danube in 1809 . Four years later , Napoleon made Bertrand grand marshal of the imperial palace , and in this capacity the old soldier followed his master into exile at St. Helena . When Bertrand died , in 1844 , he bequeathed his notebooks of the exile to his daughter Hortense , who in turn entrusted them to a French bureaucrat with orders to publish them 25 years after her death . All in all , it was not until 1946 that the grand marshal 's strongbox was finally opened , and his St. Helena papers were laid before the historians . <P> " But after the first thrill of emotion , what a formidable surprise ! " says Transcriber Paul Fleuriot de Langle . The papers comprise a diary which records Napoleon 's conversations throughout the exile , and a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a private shorthand of hieroglyphic complexity , e.g. , " N.a. j. et . d. sa. sal . de bil une Ba ; il . due au Gm. sil sa. ce. q. c'e . C'une ma. de G. il d. dab. q. cest un bal. p. ses enf . Est ce p. ser. a desc. sur un remp ; pen d'esp. p. un ing. sa f . . . . " <P> Armed with a magnifying glass and cheered on by old Napoleon buffs , De Langle began to unscramble the gibberish . He found that General Bertrand had made the job still more difficult by referring to himself not as " I , " but as " Bertrand , " or " the Grand Marchal , " or worst of all , since it invited confusion with Napoleon himself , as " he . " It was three long years before De Langle could figure out who was talking to whom about what ( at times even proper names were abbreviated to initials ) , and could interpret the above example as : <P> " Napoleon has had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Marchal if he had any idea what it was . <P> " ' Some kind of war machine , I suppose , ' Bertrand said . ' Is it possible to use it for getting down on to a rampart ? ' <P> " ' Well , ' said the Emperor , ' that 's not very bright for an engineer-God 's teeth ! ' " Reason for Napoleon 's impatience : he only hoped to get some exercise seesawing with his grand marshal .
