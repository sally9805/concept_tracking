Around the world , in hot climes and cool , flourishes a group of viruses that attack the central nervous system , causing encephalitis ( inflammation of the brain ) . Many of these viruses-which scientists have classified in two distinct families labeled " A " and " B " - have defied the efforts of virologists and immunologists to devise protective vaccines . Now Johns Hopkins University 's Dr. Winston H. Price reports what appears to be a major breakthrough in the war against the encephalitides . The technique depends on family similarity : immunity against two or three members of the B virus family , it appears , gives immunity against the rest of their deadly kin . <P> In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Biochemist Price describes the ' ' immunological overlap ' ' among the B viruses , most of which are borne by mosquitoes or ticks . Most feared are Japanese B encephalitis , Russian spring-summer fever , St. Louis encephalitis and Murray Valley fever . *Closely related is dengue ( " breakbone fever " ) , and also yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1937 . <P> Dr. Price 's team developed an ingenious technique against B viruses . First they inoculate the human subject with the well-proved yellow-fever vaccine . About four months later they give a shot of live West Nile virus-which infects millions in the Near East , causes distressing fevers but is usually no threat to life . After the yellow-fever shot , the subject throws off the West Nile infection readily-and in the process his system develops antibodies against it . Some months later ( Dr. Price is still not sure what is the best interval ) , he gets a third shot , this one of killed Japanese B virus . The result , studies to date indicate , is across-the-board immunity against all the B viruses .
