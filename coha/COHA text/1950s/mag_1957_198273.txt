First Party Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was 63 last week , and like a-red-eyed Russian bear he barged through Moscow reception rooms with hugs and handclasps , slaps and swipes for his startled guests . At a party for Albania 's visiting Communist Boss Enver Hoxha , he spotted tall , handsome Yugoslav Ambassador Veljko Micunovic . " There 's no need to be hiding in the back of the hall , " cried Khrushchev . " Come up here . Let 's have a toast . " Khrushchev bubbled on : " The Hungarian situation was pretty hot , as hot as Hungarian pepper , and added to this pepper was Egypt . But things are settling down . We fought the Germans and the Japanese , and yet we want better relations with them . We never fought the Yugoslavs and never will . " <P> As Ambassador Micunovic 's smile broadened . Nikita gave his arm a playful twist . " We must achieve unity , and I am confident we will . I am certain some of the Yugoslav leaders and the people of Yugoslavia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nikita 's implication that there was a division among Yugoslav leaders , asked : <P> ' Whom shall we believe now ? Today the one says one thing and tomorrow the other makes a 180-degree turn . " ) <P> Amiable Person . Lurching over to Norway 's Ambassador Braadland ( who had just delivered Norway 's polite but stiff reply to a Soviet threat of massive atomic retaliation ) , Khrushchev chortled : " Look what an amiable person he is . He represents a neighboring country and a member of NATO . Well , willy-nilly we have to reckon with this . " <P> Another foreigner caught his eye . " And here too is M. Dejean , the French Ambassador . He represents a country the ruling circles of which , jointly with the governments of Britain and Israel , organized the aggression against Egypt . They tried to subjugate Egypt by force of arms , but nothing came of it , and they had to clear out . We were upset when the war against Egypt was unleashed , but we rejoiced when the hostilities were ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Khrushchev put his arm around U.S. Ambassador Charles E. Bohlen ( who left the Soviet Union the following day on his way to take over the U.S. Embassy at Manila ) , declared expansively : " We do not understand why they are taking you away from us and sending you so far away . We understand you . and you understand us . We hate to see you go . " <P> Rapped Knuckles . On other occasions the friendly bear was in a rib-crushing mood . At a reception for Poland 's Premier Jozef Cyrankiewicz , the expansive Nikita , tiddly again , joked about the number of times " our troops have been in Poland and your troops have been in Moscow . " Twitting the sweating Polish Premier over the negotiations now going on between the U.S. and Poland for economic aid , he said with a grin : " Comrade Cyrankiewicz , you are now being wooed like a bride , but it is not because you are young . " Then the bear lifted his heavy paw in a warning . <P> Said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not joke with us . Do not try to test us like you did in Hungary with the Putsch . You think of doing it , not only in Hungary , but also maybe in East Germany . Be careful . We are not saints , and if necessary we will rap your knuckles . "
