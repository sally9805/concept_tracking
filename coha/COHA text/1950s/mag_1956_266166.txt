( See Cover ) <P> Seven years ago , under the urgency of fear , and with the leadership of the U.S. , twelve nations of Europe and America made solemn compact , one with another , that an attack upon any one of them was an attack upon all . Under the urgency of fear they pledged to unite their forces and resources on the continent of Europe under a single command . Under the urgency of fear NATO 's forces grew to become the most powerful peacetime alliance of free powers in the world 's history . <P> But the fear is gone , or at least the urgent sense of it . " There ai n't gon na be no war , " cried Britain 's Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan in the afterglow of Russian smiles at the first Geneva meeting at the summit . Last week the NATO nations , sweaty in their armor under the fitful post-Geneva sun , were somewhat shamefacedly wondering aloud whether all that weight was really necessary . They sometimes had the air of men trying to remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated was a bigger question : " Is NATO itself really necessary ? " <P> Cry for Cutbacks . All over Europe NATO 's citizens cried for reduced taxes , reduced drafts . Examples : <P> Belgium in the last two years has deactivated one of its three NATO divisions , and cut its draft period from 21 to 18 months . <P> The Netherlands has stripped four of its five divisions down to skeletons . <P> France , fighting for its life in North Africa , has robbed its four NATO divisions of its elite troops and replaced them with conscripts . <P> Denmark " can not meet its NATO promises , and we admit the reasons are political , " says Denmark 's Minister of Defense . <P> Britain is lopping 100,000 from its defense forces . <P> West Germany , nine months after receiving its sovereignty , had not yet passed even a conscription law , has only 900 volunteers actually in training . Its pfennig-pinching Finance Minister Schaefer protests that the most prosperous country in Europe can only afford a modest $2 billion a year for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , most nations answer that the U.S. , too , has reduced its defense expenditures and is cutting 400,000 men from its Army . <P> Gone are the tremulous uncertainties of 1949 , when small nations who had seen Czechoslovakia go under were wondering " who 's next ? " - those days , as one NATO official recalled last week , " when you could feel a tremor go around the council table every time one of the smaller nations received a Soviet note , and NATO , since we had no effective military organization , seemed more like a source of trouble than of strength . " <P> To some extent , NATO is a victim of its own success . Statesmen , who are politicians when they get back home , have found it all too easy to believe that their security is the result , not of their own strength but of a change in Russian hearts . " The threat of war is diminishing . " they chant .                  @ @ @
