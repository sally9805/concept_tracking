After a quarter-century of trying to set its foreign exchange rates by complex official decrees , Chile chucked the philosophy of government control over the value of the peso and went back to the supply-and-demand free rate . <P> Chile 's experience with controls started out in 1931 as a Depression attempt to subsidize business by giving varying values to the peso ( which had been traded freely at eight to the dollar ) . Depending on their utility , as evaluated by the bureaucracy , various imports got various rates ; e.g. , whisky was made proportionately more costly to import than milk . Export rates , too , were adjusted to let commodities-in theory at least-meet foreign competition ; there was a " copper dollar , " a " wine dollar , " a " nitrate dollar " and a " sulphur dollar . " Soon the government was in the satisfying business of creaming off a profit from exchange transactions . <P> <P> The system cost heavily in corruption aimed at getting favorable rates . Investment was discouraged , because the government 's cut worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the exchange from slipping . Under pressure from internal inflation , the scale of official rates dropped steadily to as low as 300 ; the limited free market that the law permitted hit a peak of more than 800 last August . U.S. Economic Consultants Klein &; Saks , hired then by Chile to cure its economic fevers , made freeing the peso a high-priority recommendation . <P> Before taking the stern measure , Finance Minister Oscar Herrera made a couple of prudent hedges . One was a flat ban on importing certain luxuries , to prevent a possibly perilous outrush of dollars for goods not really needed . Another was an agreement with the International Monetary Fund , the U.S. Treasury and eight U.S. banks for a $75 million stabilization fund to meet possible dollar runs . The free rate is expected to settle around 500 , then begin the hard climb back .
