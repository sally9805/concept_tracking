Broadway , which has suffered through one inept comedy after another since Labor Day , was subjected to three in a row last week : <P> Buy Me Blue Ribbons ( by Sumner Locke Elliot ; produced by Jay Robinson ) tells the story of a spoiled , posturing ex-Hollywood child star ( Jay Robinson ) who is persuaded to step out of a part he is n't right for , in a play he is producing with his own movie cash . The play was expressly written for Producer Robinson after he was persuaded to step out of such a part last season . He is n't right for this one , either : he plays a farce role with quite un-comic intensity . But the play does have a certain breeziness and three talented comediennes-Audrey Christie , Vicki Cummings , Enid Markey . They are cio match , however , for a sagging play and an actor who keeps spoiling his jokes . <P> Faithfully Yours ( by L. Bush-Fekete &; Mary Helen Fay ; produced by Richard W. Krakeur ) is one of those bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns a psychoanalyst who persuades a bird-brained wife that there is something unhealthy about her happy marriage and faithful husband . The worst thing about the play is n't that it never comes within hailing distance of satire , but that it is altogether stupefying as farce . And to the claptrap of Broadway , Movie Actors Ann Sothern and Robert Cummings add all the coyness of Hollywood . <P> Love and Let Love ( by Louis Verneuil ; produced by Anthony B. Farrell ) is a vehicle for Ginger Rogers ' first Broadway appearance in 21 years . It is a sort of bicycle built for two-both for being sadly out of date , and for letting Ginger play a glamorous actress and , in one scene , her sister , who has always taken a back seat . The actress has almost-but never quite - married many men , because her heart belongs to her first love ( Tom Helmore ) . Discovering this , her middle-aged fiance ( Paul McGrath ) turns into a Mr. Fixit . Actress Rogers ' costumes are one of the few real assets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actor Helmore 's pleasantly natural playing .
