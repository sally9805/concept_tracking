The Girl Ca n't Help It ( 20th Century-Fox ) marks the debut as a movie star of Jayne Mansfield , who has already achieved a tape measure 's worth of fame through publicity stills . The plot is frankly built around the 23-year-old platinum blonde 's physical proportions . A gangster who wants to marry Jayne has given an agent six weeks to build her up into a famous singer . The agent protests : " Rome was n't built in a day . " The gangster retorts : " She ai n't Rome . She 's built . " <P> Edge of the City ( Jonathan ; MGM ) is a movie with a message : a man is ten feet tall . That , in fact , is the title of the Robert Alan Aurthur TV play from which Author Aurthur adapted the movie . The unusual thing about the film is that the message is delivered by a Negro ( Sidney Poitier ) to a white man ( John Cassavetes ) . Surprisingly enough in a Hollywood movie , the Negro is not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , and is at all times his superior , possessing greater intelligence , courage , understanding , warmth and general adaptability . The mystery is why so engaging a Negro would waste time on so boringly primitive a white man . <P> The Wrong Man ( Warner ) . When the true story of Manny Balestrero was printed in the newspapers a few years ago , it made a strange and haunting tale . On the afternoon of Jan. 13 , 1953 , Balestrero , an $85-a-week bass player at Manhattan 's crusty , upper-crust Stork Club , went to the office of a Long Island insurance company to raise a small loan on his wife 's policy . The next evening he was arrested and " positively identified " by two of the insurance company 's employees as the man who months earlier had robbed the office at gunpoint of $271 . An innocent victim of mistaken identity , Balestrero was booked , fingerprinted , spent a night in jail , had to face suspicion and publicity , raise $5,000 bond , and defend himself as justice took its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was placed in an institution . Even so , Balestrero was lucky . Between a mistrial and preparations for retrial , the real thief was caught , and confessed to the crime . <P> As a true story , Balestrero 's ordeal had drama , heart tugs , near tragedy , even , with his wife better , an upbeat ending . As fiction , with Henry Fonda playing Balestrero , the drama , heart tugs and near tragedy have been dissipated . Director Alfred Hitchcock , in a change of pace from his usual suspense formula , seems to have been so impressed with having a true story to tell that he gave it a completely literal rendering . Turning the story into fiction without fictionalizing , he stripped it of its emotional impact ; by sticking to the facts , he missed the truth .
