txt A possibly fatal blow was struck at the long-disputed DixonYates contract by the House Appropriations Committee today . The committee eliminated the funds asked by the President . to put into operation his ideas of private vs. public power producing . It recommended instead that the same money be given to increase the generating capacity for public power by the Tennessee Valley Authority . Democrats , now in control of Congress , predicted that the House committee decision would be sustained , but after bitter floor battles . The House test was scheduled tentatively to start next Wednesday . It was obvious that the fight would be hotly partisan , with echoes reaching far into the 1956 political campaigns . Only rarely has the House reversed decisions made by its Appro-1 priations Committee for a ma- ' jor issue . Atom Budget Is Cut Today 's developments came as the committee approved a $1 , - 285,000,000 funds bill to finance governmental public works projects through the fiscal year starting next July 1 . The Atomic Energy Commission was recommended for 5618 , - 000.000 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were held to allow it to continue its pro- , grams in full . The T. V. A. got less than it asked for , but the committee held that it has received plenty and without danger of retarding Its work . The Southeastern Power Administration got what it sought , $1,160,000 . The Southwestern Power Administration received an over-all increase of $5.550.000 , while the Bonneville Power Administration got $21 , - 100,000 , a cut of $903,000 . A reduction of $34,525,000 was made in the requests of the Reclamation Bureau , and $39,204,000 was cut from the rivers and harbors funds plea made by the Army Engineers . Meanwhile , the Hoover Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government was preparing a report to recommend that rates for all federally produced electric power be increased . The COM- , mission would place all such projects under the Federal Power ' Commission and revise rates to include the " equivalent " of Federal , state and local taxes and other costs now paid by private power companies . Concept Is Modified Long a doctrine of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commission task force recommendation that all federally financed generating capacity be leased or sold to private power interests . President Eisenhower recently assured a news conference that he was not interested in " wrecking " the T. V. A. He said this in response to questions on published reports of the Hoover task force recommendation . However , Congressional sources said the forthcoming modified proposal would add new fuel to the legislative fight on the power issue . In the background of Lie Dixon-Yates decision was twenty-five-year contract for that group to supplement T.V.A. p-oduction of power for the benefit of Atomic Energy Commission facilities . This is in litigation . Ground already was broken for a Dixon-Yates plant at West Memphis , Ark . Its cost was estimated at $107,000,000 . It was to pipe its power to the middle of the Mississippi River , where a T. V. A. line would pick it up for A .. E. C. use . The money requested by the President was comparatively small . It was $6,500,000 for the building of the Dixon-Yates transmission lines . It also was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dixon-Yates project . After a strong closed-session fight , the Appropriations group beat off a Republican attempt to prevent the building of a new T. V. A. generating plant that apparently would make the Dixon-Yates plant unnecessary or impotent through inability to transmit its power to a source that could be supplied by the new competing Government facility . The committee recommended that the $6,500,000 be withdrawn from the Dixon-Yates transmission lines and be applied to the building by the T. V. A. of a new generating plant near Fulton , Tenn . The proposed Fulton plant had been long proposed , and turned down by Congress . Today it appeared to have high favor as an alternative to the Dixon-Yates program . The ultimate cost of the Fulton plant was estimated at $90,000,000 . In committee the showdown was reported to be comparatively close . However , the partisanship of the issue was viewed as indicating that Democratic opponents of the Dixon-Yates plan could win by superior numbers of votes in the House and Senate . The House committee did not take an outright position as to the Dixon-Yates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatience over a situation in which power shortages were threatened in a vital defense production area . " For two years , " its report stated , " the Administration has failed to recommend any newl starts in generating capacity for ; T. V. A. although its load is I ' growing rapidly in this area and ' installations vital to defense arel located there . " Last year the failure to provide capacity resulted in the Dixon-Yates arrangement which is in litigation at the present time and there is no indication it will be settled soon . This year the Administration failed to recommend funds for new capacity , ( relying upon the Dixon-Yates proposal and the expectation that Congress would pass a proposed new financing plan for T. V. A. during the session . " To date no action has been taken on such a bill . T. V. A. must be assured of adequate generating capacity and while the ' committee is not increasing the total amount of the requested appropriation , the T. V. A. should proceed at once with the two units at the Fulton site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Such capacity must be started immediately to be available when needed and there should be no further delay in this important matter .
