Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> <P> Publisher Bernarr ( " Body Love " ) MacFadden , 85 , whose foibles were mercilessly chronicled by his former wife Mary ( Dumbbells and Carrot Strips ) MacFadden ( TIME , April 20 ) , was beginning to look like material for a whole encyclopedia of Bernarrisms , one volume to a wife . In a Manhattan court last week , present wife Jonnie Lee MacFadden , 47 , who is suing Physical Culturist MacFadden for a separation , recited all the makings of a slam-bang first chapter . Aside from such routine quirks as parachuting into rivers and sleeping on a hard pallet beside her bed , Bernarr , lamented Jonnie , had cultivated more than his muscles ; he also developed some annoying " obsessions . " In dead of night he once depalletized himself , got dressed and strode chestily off into the out-of-doors because Jonnie 's apartment was " too fancy " for him . Mealtimes were trying : Vegetarian MacFadden peevishly accused Jonnie of trying to poison him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion to prove it was harmless , " he kept raving . . . and took the food and threw it in the kitchen sink . " The last straw for Jonnie : Bernarr figured that she left her 15th-floor bedroom window open for her lover to steal in at night . <P> <P> James Roosevelt , already accused by his estranged wife Romelle of wholesale adultery ( with three named corespondents , nine also-rans ) , was also accused of being a millionaire . At a preliminary hearing last week in a Pasadena court , Romelle. who married Jimmy for richer or for poorer , reported that it had turned out richer : " Several years ago . Mr. Roosevelt said he was worth several million dollars , so we could live in a lavish manner . " Then Jimmy took the stand and said with a grin that he was considerably poorer than that . His insurance companies ( which Romelle assessed at $4,000,000 ) were " worthless " ; his income was only $2,425.57 a month ; he spent half again more than he made ; he even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turning off the grin , Jimmy groaned : " I guess I 'm getting poorer by the minute . " <P> <P> In Albuquerque to whoop it up at a Democratic dinner , National Democratic Chairman Stephen Mitchell announced that he will resign in November . Asked if Toledo 's Michael DiSalle might succeed him , Mitchell huffed : " I have n't heard anyone talking about DiSalle except DiSalle himself . " <P> <P> Boston was in an uproar over a scheduled nightclub appearance of Christine ( n George ) Jorgensen . After fiery debate on whether ex-G.I . Jorgensen is a female or merely a female impersonator , the Massachusetts legislature passed a muddled resolution which said that Christine 's act might " adversely affect the morals of the youths . " Then Boston 's licensing board stopped the whole show by revoking the nightclub 's entertainment license , and the club canceled Christine 's contract . <P>
