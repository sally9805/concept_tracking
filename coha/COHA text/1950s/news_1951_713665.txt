Councilman Asks Inquiry In another- development yesterday , City Councilman Earl Brown , Manhattan Democrat , introduced a resolution calling for the appointment of a five-man committee to investigate athletic programs and practices in all colleges within the city . The measure , which was referred to the Council 's Committee on Rules , said the proposed investigation should " make certain that all forms of sports at the city 's colleges are run on a purely amateur basis . " It added that Mr. Hogan 's basketball inquiry indicated " a serious laxity in the proper administration of athletic programs .

" Questioned by reporters about the Duquesne game after he had left Mr. Hogan 's office , Lipman denied he had received any money for " throwing " it . He said he thought the $300 was a " come-on " bonus to " get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lipman had named another teammate , Eddie Gard , already charged with being Sollazzo 's intermediary , as the player who first approached him , along with another unidentified player , and asked him to " go along on a fix . " Later , when Gard no longer was a member of the team , he and another former player told Lipman that if he would " go along " they could split up $7,500 on a game , Mr. Hogan explained . Mr. Lipman again refused . Lipman and Gard later met a " fixer " in a Brooklyn restaurant , according to the District Attorney , and talked about " fixing " a game . At this meeting , Gard told the briber that the players wanted $5,000 a game and would require that the money be paid before the start of the contest . " Nothing came of that so far as Lipman knows , " Mr. Hogan said . A. new " fixer " entered the scene // shortly before the Duquesne game , ' Mr. Hogan said , and he quoted Lipman as saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an over-all settlement of $5,000 a game . Mr. Hogan said that this " fixer " actually went to the team 's , locker room in Madison Square Garden just before the start of the game to tell some of the " fix " players other than Lipman that the " fix " was on . A few days after the game , Mr. Hogan explained , Miller , Gard , Lipman and an unidentified player met near the university 's campus in Brooklyn . Miller , Lipman and the unidentified player , whom Mr. Hogan called " X , " asked Gard , intermediary hi the bribe , for the money . Gard said he did not have it , Mr. Hogan related , but that he would see what he could do . The next night Lipman and Miller went to Gard 's house but " X " was not invited . The purpose of the visit , according to Mr. Hogan , was to meet with a former L. I. U. player ; identified only as " Y , " who was supposed to have the $5,000 bribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' X , ' the prosecutor observed , noting that the four conspirators planned to divide the $5,000 in such a manner that each would get $1,100 but " X " would receive only $600 . When " Y " arrived , however , he said he had no money , Mr. Hogan reported , but had given it back to the " fixer . " The District Attorney said " Y " gave the youths a " pep talk " and told them that the " fixer " was going to hold the money for them and triple the bribe payments after the next game . Lipman rebelled , Mr. Hogan said , and on a subsequent Western tripe the L. I. U. team won its first three games but then lost four straight . After attending summer school in 1949 , Lipman sought out " Y , " who insisted he had returned the money to the alleged " fixer .
