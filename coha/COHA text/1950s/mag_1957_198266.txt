The Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa is an unlikely place to find a man who retired to a South Carolina farm this year to spend the rest of his life " fishing and hunting , and lying in the sun , and watching my cows eat grass . " But to Addis Ababa last week journeyed James Prioleau ( " Dick " ) Richards of Heath Springs , S.C . A longtime ( 1933-56 ) Congressman , Democrat Richards , 62 , had dutifully postponed his fishing and cow watching to undertake , at President Eisenhower 's request , a mission as vital to the success of U.S. foreign policy as any since the Korean war . <P> Richards ' task was to explain the Eisenhower Doctrine to Middle East governments , win their approval of its firm stand against Communist expansion into the area , and decide on specific military and economic-aid projects adding up to a possible $200 million . His qualifications : prestige on Capitol Hill , five years of experience as chairman of the House Foreign <P> Affairs Committee , straight-backed bearing , robust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cool , shrewd good sense . <P> Cordiality in Kabul . Setting out in mid-March with six Washington-appointed aides and two secretaries , Richards started off with pro-Western countries : Lebanon , Libya , Turkey , Iran , Pakistan . With apparent success he earnestly tried to clear away any suspicions that the Eisenhower Doctrine harbored hidden motives or involved any infringement of sovereignty . From Pakistan Richards flew to Afghanistan , which had declared itself neutral in the cold war and welcomed aid and technicians from neighboring Russia . At the end of three days in the chilly capital city of Kabul , Richards and Prime Minister Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan issued a cordial joint communique that , to the State Department 's pleased surprise , included Afghan approval of the U.S. 's Middle East objectives : economic growth and national independence . <P> In friendly Iraq Richards signed a $12.5 million program of regional highway , railroad and telecommunication projects linking and strengthening the Baghdad Pact 's four Middle East members : Iraq , Iran , Pakistan and Turkey . In Saudi Arabia he got along with King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to " Communist activities " more forthrightly than Washington had expected , considering Saud 's formal adherence to Egyptian Dictator Gamal-Abdel Nasser 's policy of " positive neutrality . " Last week Dick Richards convinced Emperor Haile Selassie that the Eisenhower Doctrine did not mean interference in Ethiopian affairs-and impressed the Emperor 's countrymen , who soon dubbed Richards " the spry one . " <P> Dents in the Mountains . At week 's end , as Richards moved on to the Sudan , it was still undecided whether he would go to troubled Jordan , troublemaking Egypt or fanatic-ridden Syria . A policy had been laid down in advance that he would visit only countries that invited him , and the rulers of Egypt and Syria were still wavering between two unpleasant alternatives : to swallow pride and invite Richards , or pass up the big chance to get a badly needed slice of that $200 million .
