" All successful newspapers , " declaimed querulous , bellicose H. L. Mencken , " are ceaselessly querulous and bellicose . " The most conspicuous exception to Mencken 's Law is the Christian Science Monitor ( circ. 158,729 ) . which never whines , cusses or blusters , but sets out daily , as enjoined by Christian Science Founder Mary Baker Eddy , to ' ' spread confidence instead of fear , record the good men do instead of magnifying and exploiting the regrettable evil . " <P> Balancing Fact . Fifty years old this year , and firmly fixed as one of the world 's most respected dailies , the dignified Monitor permits itself the one gentle brag that it publishes " everything that a well-informed person should know . " Since 90% of its press run is mailed to subscribers in the U.S. and 120 other countries . Boston 's Monitor ( " An International Daily Newspaper " ) has no truck with trivia , concentrates instead on solid , staff-written interpretative reporting that its editors expect will still be relevant days or weeks later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the news profession : its subscribers include 4,000 editors and newspapers throughout the world , some of whom pay as much as $1,000 a year to have their copies airmailed ( worldwide , first-class-mail subscription rate : $18 ) . <P> To a large extent the Monitor 's excellence derives from Editor Erwin Dain Canham , 53 , veteran newspaperman who has little but scorn for the artificial " objectivity " that cloaks the superficiality of much news writing . Says " Spike " Canham : " We believe that the balancing fact should be attached directly to the misleading assertion . News interpretation , with all its hazards , is often safer and wiser than printing the bare news alone . Nothing can be more misleading than the unrelated fact , just because it is a fact and hence impressive . " Example : during the rise of the late Joe McCarthy , the Monitor was one of the few U.S. dailies that consistently and searchingly matched the balancing facts against the Wisconsin Senator 's strident fictions . <P> " Passed-On Mules . " If the church-owned Monitor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it agrees with the Christian Scientists who comprise 85% of its readership ( and 90% of its staff ) that disease , death and violence are mortal " errors . " Thus the Monitor gives only token coverage to top medical stories such as the Salk vaccine ; it sternly downplays disaster and crime . It shuns error-prone society and show-business chitchat and runs the world 's tersest obituaries ( omitting the cause of death and names of survivors ) . <P> Under gentle , scholarly Spike Canham , the Monitor has shucked many of its old customs , become lighter and brighter . Of late it has run stories about such long-taboo topics as organized crime , prostitution and homosexuality , not infrequently reports that a person has died rather than " passed on " -a sharp departure from World War I days when , it is related , a hard-pressed correspondent , described a battlefield littered with " passed-on mules . " When it comes to profit , the Monitor has netted only $260 in the past 15 years ; it firmly excludes a long list of advertisers it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent medicines , coffee , tea ) and refuses to run any ad containing the abbreviation " Xmas .
