President Eisenhower 's proposal last winter for a nonpartisan monetary commission to study the nation 's financial system set Congress forthwith to courting reasons why a congressional committee could do the job and do it better . But even on that score a hitch arose ; nobody in Congress could decide which committee qualified . <P> First to apply for the job of ferreting out fiscal failings was Texas Democrat Wright Patman , who proposed a House Banking and Currency subcommittee ( headed by Patman ) to look into the fiscal picture . He received Speaker Sam Rayburn 's blessing , but little more . The House , which knows Patman as an easy-money man who blames most of the world 's troubles on big bankers , handily voted down an enabling resolution . Another candidate , Senate Banking and Currency Chairman J. William Fulbright , was equally unpromising . Two years ago Fulbright and his committee undertook an investigation of the stock market , accomplished little more than a sharp drop in market prices . <P> Last week a surprise nominee walked off with the honors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Finance Committee would begin hearings on " the financial condition of the U.S. " by mid-May , would carry out " one of the broadest investigations ever undertaken by Congress . " Because the committee already has funds to begin , Byrd asked for no approval , needed none . But he could certainly have got it had he tried . To the Senate , which reveres Harry Byrd as a man who knows fiscal policy as well as he knows Virginia apples , his credentials were eminently satisfactory .
