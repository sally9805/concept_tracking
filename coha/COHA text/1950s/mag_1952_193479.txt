The team blocking the path of Kansas ' N.C.A.A. winners was , fittingly enough , Philadelphia 's La Salle , winner of the recent National Invitation Tournament . In contrast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of deft ball handlers and sharpshooters , though none of them matches Lovellette 's scoring potential . <P> In this week 's collegiate final at Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden , it was Lovellette v. La Salle .
