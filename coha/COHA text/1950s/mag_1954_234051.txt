Doctors used to think they could relax about hepatitis after the end of a major war . " Infectious jaundice " ( as it was commonly called from its most obvious symptom ) was regarded as a disease of wartime camps with poor sanitation ; peacetime outbreaks were relatively few and usually limited to overcrowded institutions such as orphanages , mental hospitals and prisons . Today , inflammation of the liver as a result of invasion by a virus is becoming a major health problem in the workaday , peacetime U.S. <P> No less than 33,382 cases were reported to the Public Health Service in 1953 ( and reported cases are believed to be only a fraction of the actual total ) . The latest P.H.S. figures , for the third week in January , show 1,214 cases , or almost double the 1953 rate , though much of the apparent increase is due to better reporting . <P> Equal Misery . Syracuse , N.Y . recorded 46 cases within a month , and the whole town was talking about it . Two aspirants for public office were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates with the question , " Have you now or have you ever had infectious hepatitis ? " New Jersey was sifting the data on more than 150 cases in a single school . California reported 30 cases in a housing project where water from washing machines had backed up into the drinking supply . <P> Physicians make a sharp distinction between infectious hepatitis , usually spread by fecal matter , and serum hepatitis , or " needle jaundice , " because the latter is carried only by blood. * That , and the fact that the serum type takes two or more months to develop ( three times as long as the infectious variety ) , are the most obvious differences . Both kinds of hepatitis make the patient equally miserable , causing headache , fever , nausea and loss of appetite . In most cases , jaundice appears . Though hepatitis is rarely fatal , it may cause severe liver damage . <P> And many patients feel fine after a few weeks and go back to school or work , only to be laid low again , perhaps repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gamma globulin , given while the infectious form of the disease is incubating , may greatly lessen the severity of the attack or actually prevent it . But once the infection is full-blown , doctors can do nothing more than put their patients to bed , and feed them a highprotein , high-carbohydrate diet with plenty of vitamins . <P> The viruses ( evidently close kin ) that cause the two types of hepatitis have never been isolated . They defy attacks by chemicals , heat , cold and ultraviolet rays . <P> And no vaccine can yet be prepared , since they perversely refuse to infect any animal but man . The P.H.S. has found many volunteer human guinea pigs in federal prisons , will soon report on its findings . The Army has some 60 investigators working on hepatitis . So far , the best protection seems to be scrupulous sanitation , and the only prophylactic , immunization with gamma globulin . <P> <P> * And is , therefore , contracted from transfusions or from improperly sterilized needles used in taking blood samples .
