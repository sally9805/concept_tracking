( See Cover ) <P> Among all the complicated engines contrived by man , few have titillated the imagination like that noble automotive artifact , the Stanley Steamer . Nobody , according to early legend , knew how fast it would go , but thousands of dustered and begoggled motorists believed that a man with nerve enough to hold its throttle open after his hat flew off could keep it accelerating indefinitely . It was rumored - though here the mind reeled and the senses boggled-that it might reach 100 miles an hour . <P> Last week , after a decade of the greatest industrial achievement man had ever known , many a citizen had gotten the same feeling about the productive capacity of the U.S. The idea that one nation could successfully jack up the whole Western world , put it on wheels and tow it along , perhaps for decades , was almost too fantastic to grasp . Here was the U.S. with the Korean war to fight , with India to feed , with Europe to supply , arm and encourage , with enormous armed forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gigantic project-a productive effort completely without precedent in human affairs . <P> But most Americans do n't know their own strength . To the men who man and manage the nation 's production lines , the project , enormous as it was , did not seem in the least fantastic . To Defense Mobilizer Charles E. Wilson , the man who had been seated at the wheel of U.S. production , it was , quite simply , a job which could be done because it had to be done ( see EDUCATION ) . As the nation 's Mr. Production , he has not the slightest doubt that U.S. brain and muscle can accomplish anything that is asked of it-and double the accomplishment next year . <P> All This &; More ? At 64 , Charlie Wilson is a magnificent specimen of an authentic 20th Century phenomenon , the American production man . He sees nothing astounding at all in the fact that the country has , in the five years since the world 's greatest and most exhausting war , both manufactured and absorbed , among other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines , 20,816,000 refrigerators , 110,940,000 men 's suits , about 5 billion undergarments . <P> He is neither surprised nor particularly dazzled by the fact that the U.S. has been able at the same time to pour billions in dollars and goods into the war-torn countries of Europe and Asia . He is calmly convinced that the U.S. can now turn to building $50 billion a year worth of tanks , planes and guns with only a temporary halt in the flow of new houses , bigger television screens and better automatic toasters . " The productivity of the U.S. is so tremendous , " said Charles Wilson recently , " that if we started an all-out economic mobilization today , we could practically fill Texas with war machines by 1952.
