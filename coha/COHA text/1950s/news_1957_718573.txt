txt There 's a ceremony going on j at Mary 's house ; the eight little girls have gone home now gorged with birthday cake , but this ceremony remains and Mary knows it is important by her father 's voice . " With that gift from Grandfather , and the allowance money you saved from Christmas . and what I 'll give you , you have enough to buy an E-bond , " be says impressively . Mother knows her cue and exclaims , " No ! " with just the right expression of pleased astonishment And so with the grave importance of a seven-year-old , Mary puts up $18.75 which , by some fairy-story logic of its own , turns into $25 later on . She is launched on what her fond parents hope is a life of thrift and saving . Pavroll , Plan Tops By this and other means some 41.5 billion dollars worth of E-and H-bonds are now in the hands of American iamqies ; one out of five of the 50 million American families bought some last year . and three out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the payroll savings plan which builds automatic saving right into the wage envelope . They are the most important vehicle for regular wage saving in America today . Nobody can speak lightly of 41 billion dollars , or an institution like this . But the fact is ? something was the matter . More people were cashing in savings bonds than buying them . The Treasury has been more concerned than it cared to admit . The government 's " tight money " policy has , sent up interest rates everywhere else and the 3 per cent for savings bonds at maturity has been at an increasing disadvantage competitively . Cash-In Total Rises For six straight months now including January , E and H bond cash-ins have topped new sales . For seven of the last 8 months the number of cash-ins has increased . - In January it was 547 million dollars  --  the biggest redemption month in 10 years . New sales in January totaled only 465 million dollars . i - . What was happening ?

That is what the Treasury is now doing . It is offering purchasers better bargains on E and H bonds . Treasury Nonplussed For months  --  probably years  --  the Treasury has been wondering what to do . The result now may not seem commensurate with the problem  --  the interest rate at maturity  --  with swift congressional approval expected  --  will be upped only one-quarter of 1 per cent . The life of the bonds is also somewhat shortened . Yet the Treasury has put in enormous study on the matter , welding what might be called the practical and moral factors into a new offer . Nobody knows how the public will react . In a way it 's Iike testing sales reaction to a new brand of soap . The Treasury was caught on the horns of a dilemma . If it did not raise interest rates people would cash bonds and turn elsewhere . ( Savings banks now widely offer 3 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations offer 3.5 per cent or more . ) On the other hand if it raised interest rates too much  --  say one-half of one per cent  --  millions of present United States bond holders would be tempted to cash them for the more generous yield . Caught between these vast forces we now come back to little Mary who proudly is just buying her first bond . It looks like a bargain to her , paying only $18.75 for a $25 piece of paper ! Previously she would have had to wait 9 years and 8 months to get the full face value of $25  --  a 3 per cent interest rate . ' Bargain Built In New she will have to wait only 8 years and 11 months . This means 3% per Scent . ' Furthermore , the redemption value in early years has been favorably rejiggered . Savings bonds , because of maximum safety , freedom from market fluctuation and protection gainst physical loss of securities , offer a bargain in many respects .
