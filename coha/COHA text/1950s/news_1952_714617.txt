txt TOKYO , Saturday , April 19 ? All the disputed issues in the negotiations for an armistice in Korea were turned back today to staff officers for further . exploration to determine . what areas might exist between the Communists and the United Nation views . The committee of generals that for the last week had been meeting at Panmunjom only a few minutes daily , with neither side presenting new material on Communist demands for the right to build airfields in North Korea and for Soviet participation in armistice control , passed further debate over to the group of colonels . Meanwhile staff officers held their first meeting since April 4 on the exchange of prisoners after the truce . The session was held in // secret , and no announcement was made whether progress had been made during the adjournment taken to permit both sides to study new avenues of . approach to the deadlocked issue of voluntary or forced repatriation . The agreement to give the matter of armistice conditions to the staff came after Maj. Gen. Hsieh Fang of the Chinese delegation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again underlining that the enemy , attitude on the Soviet and the airfields issues remained unchanged . " On the question of the nomination of neutral nations , we have nominated three neutral nations , in accordance with the definition of neutral nations , " General Hsieh said . The Chinese and North Koreans have designated as neutrals to send inspectors behind the lines after a truce the Soviet Union , Poland and Czechoslovakia , all of whom , they said , were non-belligerent in the Korean conflict .. " As for the so-called question of restrictions on airfields , we have unswervingly pointed out we can not consider them , " the Chinese continued . " You continue to insist on your unreasonable demands so that no progres can be made . " Allies to Keep Up Opposition The principal United Nations committee man , Maj. Gen. William K. Harrison , immediately told General Hsieh that the Allied staff officers also would continue to maintain opposition to the enemy demands . " Unless your side has something new to propose , I doubt if there will be any progress at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Item 3 of the agenda scheduled to resume tomorrow are faced with the same deadlock that the generals had been unable to solve . General Harrison told correspondents after the ten-minute session : " We have no intention of giving in on these two issues . " The committee on Item 4 ? prisoner exchange  --  met for twentytwo minutes this morning , recessed for an hour , sat again for nine minutes more , then suspended for the day . Col. George W. Hickman declined to make any statement , explaining : " We are still in executive session . " There had been reports what might be the answer to many prisoners had been under consideration during the break in the talks but this was not confirmed as the staff officers met again . The official Peiping radio broadcast yesterday a statement by Gen. Peng Teh-huai , the Chinese Communist commander in Korea , that might be the answer to many reports that an armistice agreement could be expected shortly . In effect , he told the United Nations to accept the Communist terms for a truce or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission of a long account of an interview said to have been given by General Peng in his headquarters in a cave in North Korea , he said : " We are not afraid of fighting ; the more we fight the stronger we become . " He added that the United Nations negotiators had fumbled the armistice talks because they had failed to understand Chinese motives for Korean intervention and they " can not make us out at all . " " The enemy agreed-.to negotiate with us because we gave them a good hiding , " General Peng said ? repeating a favoritel . Communist propaganda contention that the United Nations had been forced to sue for peace in Korea . " They have not given up during the talks . They started their autumn offensive , which ended in fiasco for them with 120,000 casualties , and so they resumed talks . " Now they are in a dilemma . There is no victory possible for them  --  no way out . If they give in to a peace , the monopoly capitalists lose their rocketing profits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . "
