txt The Supreme Court was more in the mind of the capital today as a result of its recent decisions on individual liberties than at any time since its great battles with President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the early days- of the New Deal . Following on its decision in the pudic school segregation cases , it now has spoken out on the other great controversies of the post-war era : individual liberty vs. national security ; the rights and responsibilities of Government employes ; the investigative power of state and Federal Legislatures ; and the ancient traditions of the sanctity of reputation , the right of privacy , and academic freedom , Supreme , Court Criticized Today , legal experts in the Senate were conceding that tin court had put fundamental ant historic restrictions on a Congressional investigatory power that in recent years had been asserted as all but limitless . Many Senators severely criticized the high court in its reversal of the conviction of John T. Watkins for contempt of Congress . Others suggested that wholesale reform of proced'ires might be needed if the investigative pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to collapse . Also throughout today constitutional lawyers here were . studying the implications of this month 's decisions by the court , and they were pointing to the order . in the case of Prof. Paul M. Sweezey v. the State of New Hampshire as an expression of the new court 's attitude toward due process under the Fourteenth Amendment . Professor Sweezy , author and lecturer , was twice summoned before Attorney General Louis C. Wyman of New Hampshire and questioned in great detail about allegea - subversive activities . He was ' asked about lectures he had made at the university , about his interests in the Progressive party , his political-views and associations . He-denied that - he had been a member of the Communist party , but - refused to answer a number of questions about his teachings , his political opinions and associations . Thereupon he was held in contempt by the New Hampshire Supreme Court , and ordered to jail but released on *1,000 , bond , pending appeal . Chief Justice Earl Warren , announcing the judgment- of the Supreme Court and Justice Felix - Frankfurter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic and political freedom . Merely to summon a witness and compel him against his will to- disclose the nature of past expressions and associations , Chief . Justice Warren said , " is a measure of governmental interference in these matters . " We believe , " he wrote , reversing ? the judgment of the state court , " that there unquestionably was an invasion of petitioner 's liberties in the areas of academic freedom and political expression  --  areas in which Government should be extremely reticement to tread . * * * " No one should underestimate the vital role in a democracy that is played by those who guide and ? train our youth . To impose any strait-jacket - upon the intellectual leaders in our colleges and universities would imperil the future of our nation . " Frankfurter Notes Denial Justice Frankfurter noted that Professor Sweezy had sworn that he never , during the lectures at the University of New Hampshire or anywhere else , had advocated the overthrow of the Government by force or violence . Justice Franke furter added : " Progress in the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory . Insights into the mysteries of nature are born of hypothesis and speculation . " The more so is this true in the pursuit of understanding in the groping endeavors of what are called the social sciences , the concern of which is man and society . * * * " For society 's good ? if understanding be an essential need of society  --  inquiries into these problems , speculations about them , stimulation in others of reflection upon them , must be left as unfettered as possible . " Political power must abstain from intrusion into this activity of freedom , pursued in the interest of wise government and the people 's well-being , except for reasons that are exigent and obviously compelling . " Neither Chief Justice Warren , delivering the judgment of the court , nor Justice Frankfurter , concurring for himself and Justice John Marshall Harlan , felt that the state of New Hampshire had Agiven exigent and compelling reasons for their inquiries into Professor , Sweeby 's lectures , beliefs and associations . Spirit of University Justice Frankfurter dwelled in his opinion on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quoted a recent statement on the need to continue the free spirit of - the open universities of South Africa , now under attack by the South African Government : " In a university , knowledge is its own end , not merely a means to an end . A university-ceases to be true ' to its own nature if it becomes the tool of church or kale or any sectional interest . " A university is characterized by the spirit of free inquiry , its ideal being the ideal of Socrates , ? ' to follow the argument where it leads . ' This implies the right to examine , question , modify or reject traditional ideas and beliefs . " Dogma and hypothesis are incompatible , and the concept of an immutable doctrine is repugnant to the spirit of a university . The concern of its scholars is not merely to add and revise facts in relation to an accepted framework , but to be ever examining and modifying the framework itself . " Justice Frankfurter said he was not seeking to compare the situation of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added : " I do say that in these matters of the spirit inroads on legitimacy must be resisted at their incipiency . This kind of evil grows by what it is allowed to feed on : The admonition of this court in another context is applicable here : " ' It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form ; but illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way , namely , by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure ' . " The Right of Privacy This is what the Supreme Court now seems to be saying in a great number of cases : not that officials in the Executive and members of the Legislatures have evil objectives or intent , but that in recent years they seem to have become infected with a spirit of casualness or even indifference toward those legal procedures of due procese.that were - established to defend the sanctity of reputation , and the right of privacy , and to place legal limits on arbitrary action by Government . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward greater concern for individual liberties by the appointments of President Eisenhower in the last four and a half years , now is indeed proclaiming " liberty throughout all the land "  --  and doing so in no ambiguous terms . It is , indeed , giving a clear answer to the questions raised by one of its most respected brethren . in the post-war decade , the Tate Justice Robert H. Jackson , who went to his grave sorely troubled about the trend toward indifference to what he regarded as constitutional individual liberties . ' It seems to me , " Justice Jackson wrote just before he died , " these traditional freedoms are less in danger of any sudden overthrow than of being gradually bartered or traded for something else on which the people place a higher current value . ' Most Precious ' Liberty " In this anxiety-ridden time , many are ready to exchange some of - their liberties for a real or fancied increase in security against external foes , internal betrayers or criminals . Others are eager to bargain away local controls for . a Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of collective advantages . " The real question posed by the Fascist and Communist movements , which together have captivated a large part of the world 's population , is whether , today , liberty is regarded by the masses of men as their most precious possession . " Certainly in the minds of many foreign peoples our type of individual liberty has been outvalued by promises of social welfare and economic security , which they want too passionately to be critical of the price . " If this indifference to traditional values should spread to us , it would be the greatest threat to our own liberties . " The third branch of the Government is now , it seems , trying to redress the balance of the other two . It is asserting that Executive officials and legislators have been careless of fundamental individual liberties , and it is summoning them to return to what it regards as the proper procedures of Government under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .                 @ @ @ @
