Nearly 3,000,000 people who draw old-age or survivor pensions under federal Social Security last week got a raise-their first since 1939 . The raise looked big - it averaged 77%-but actually it did little more than cover the rise in the cost of living ( 73.4% ) since 1939 . Monthly checks will now average $46 a person . <P> For 7,000 retired employees of General Electric , who also draw company pensions , there was added good news . G.E . voluntarily increased pension payments by about $24 to $49 a month .
