" Not everybody . But nearly everybody , " the waiter said . " After all , sheets are sheets and some one has to change them , and some one has to wash them . Naturally I do not refer to the sheets in a hotel such as this . " " I 've had some damn good times in my life without sheets . " " Naturally . But the gondoliers , while they are the most cooperative and , for me , the finest people that we have , speak among themselves . " " Naturally . " " Then the clergy .

I will also ask to speak to Mummy and tell her where we are dining and , if you like , I will ask her permission . " " No , " the Colonel said .

The wind was at their backs and it blew the girl 's hair forward . The wind parted her hair in the back and blew it forward about her face . They were looking in the shop windows and the girl stopped in front of the lighted window of a jewelry shop . There were many good pieces of old jewelry in the window and they stood and looked at them and pointed out the best ones to each other , unclasping their hands to do so . " Is there anything you really want ? I could get it in the morning . Cipriani would loan me the money . " " No , " she said . " I do not want anything but I notice that you never give me presents .

" " I never thought you wanted presents of hard stones . " " I do n't . It is just the thought of giving and then one looks at them and thinks about them when they are worn . " " I 'm learning , " the Colonel said . " But what could I buy you on Army pay that would be like your square emeralds ? " " But do n't you see . I inherited them . They came from my grandmother , and she had them from her mother who had them from her mother . Do you think it is the same to wear stones that come from dead people ? " " I never thought about it .

I would like you to have the emeralds and you could keep them in your pocket like a lucky piece , and feel them if you were lonely . "  | " I do n't put my hands much in my pockets when I 'm working . I usually twirl a stick , or something , or point things out with a pencil .

" " That is like not being sure whether you are a virgin . What you do to give pleasure to another whom you love is most honorable . " " All right , " the Colonel said . " I will take them for better or for worse . " " Now you say thank you , " the girl said and slipped them into his pocket as quickly and ably as a jewel thief might .

" " I 'll send it in the morning . " " No . Give it to me when we have lunch before you go . " " Right , " the Colonel said . " Now we must walk or we will be too late for dinner .

" Put your hand in your pocket to please me and feel them . " The Colonel did . " They feel wonderful , " he said.  |p106THEY  came in , out of the wind and the cold , through the main entrance of the Gritti Palace Hotel , into the light and warmth of the lobby . " Good evening , Contessa , " the concierge said . " Good evening , my Colonel . It must be cold outside . " " It is , " the Colonel said , and did not add any of the rough or obscene phrases about the extent of the cold , or the force of the wind , that he could ordinarily have employed , for their mutual pleasure when speaking , alone , with the concierge . As they entered the long hallway that led to the big stairs and to the elevator , leaving , on your right , the entrance to the bar , the doorway onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , the Gran Maestro came out of the bar . He was wearing a formal white jacket , cut long , andp107he smiled at them and said , " Good evening , my Countess . Good evening , my Colonel . " " Gran Maestro , " the Colonel said . The Gran Maestro smiled and , still bowing , said , " We are dining in the bar at the far end . There is no one here now in the winter time and the dining room is too big . I have saved your table . We have a very fine lobster if you would like him to commence with . " " Is he really fresh ? " " I saw him this morning when he came from the market in a basket . He was alive and a dark green and completely unfriendly . " " Would you like lobster , Daughter , to start your dinner ? " The Colonel was conscious of using the word , and so was the Gran Maestro , and so was the girl . But to each one it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for you in case any pescecani came in . They are down now to gamble at the Lido . I was not trying to sell him . " " I would love some lobster , " the girl said . " Cold , and with mayonnaise . The mayonnaise rather stiff . " She said this in Italian . " It is n't too expensive ? " she said to the Colonel , seriously . " Ay hija mia , " the Colonel said . " Feel in your right pocket , " she said . " I 'll see that he is not too expensive , " the Gran Maestro said . " Or I 'll buy him myself . I could get him quite easily with a week 's wages . "  | " Sold to TRUST , " the Colonel said , this being the code designation of the task force occupying Trieste . " He only costs me a day 's wages . " " Put your hand in your right hand pocket and feel very rich , " the girl said . The Gran Maestro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; silently . He was happy about the girl , whom he respected and admired , and he was happy for his Colonel . " I am rich , " the Colonel said . " But if you tease me about them , I will give them back , and on the linen tablecloth , and in public . " He was teasing rough in his turn ; throwing in the counter-attack without even thinking . " No you wo n't , " she said . " Because you love them already . " " I would take anything I love and throw it off the highestcliff you ever saw and not wait to hear it bounce . " " No , you would n't , " the girl said . " You would not throw me off any high cliffs . " " No , " the Colonel agreed . " And forgive me for talking badly . " " You did n't talk very badly and I did n't believe it anyway , " the girl told him . " Now should I go to the women 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I come up to your room ? " " Which do you wish ? " " To come to your room , of course , and see how you live and how things are there . " " What about the hotel ? "  | " Everything is known in Venice anyway . But it is also known who my family are and that I am a good girl . Also they know it is you and it is I. We have some credit to exhaust . " " Good , " the Colonel said . " By stairs or elevator ? " " By elevator , " she said , and he heard the change in hervoice . " You can call a boy or we can run it ourselves . " " We run it ourselves , " the Colonel said . " I checked outon elevators long ago . " It was a good ride with a slight bump , and a rectification at the end , and the Colonel thought : Checked out , eh ? You better be checked out again . The corridor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key into the lock was not a simple process , but a rite . " Here it is , " the Colonel said when he swung the door open . " What there is of it . " " It is charming , " the girl said . " But it is awfully cold with the windows open . " " I 'll close them . " " No , please . Leave them open if you like it that way . " The Colonel kissed her and felt her wonderful , long , young , lithe and properly built body against his own body , which was hard and good , but beat-up , and as he kissed her he thought of nothing . They kissed for a long time , standing straight , and kissingtrue , in the cold of the open windows that were onto the Grand Canal . " Oh , " she said . Then , " Oh . "  | " We owe nothing , " the Colonel said . " Not a thing . " " Will you marry me and will we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will . " " The thing is that , would you ? " " Of course . " " Kiss me once again and make the buttons of your uniformhurt me but not too much . " They stood there and kissed each other true . " I have a disappointment for you , Richard , " she said . " I have a disappointmentabout everything . " She said it as a flat statement and it came to the Colonel in the same way as a message came from one of the three battalions , when the battalion commander spoke the absolutetruth and told you the worst . " You are positive ? " " Yes . " " My poor Daughter , " he said . Now there was nothing dark about the word and she was his Daughter , truly , and he pitied her and loved her . " No matter , " he said . " You comb yourself and make a new mouth and all that , and we will have a good dinner. y " Say once more , first , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love you , " the Colonel said quite formally . Then he whispered into her ear as gently as he knew how to whisper , as his whisper was when they are fifteen feet away and you are a young lieutenant on a patrol , " I love you only , my best and last and only and one true love . "  | " Good , " she said , and kissed him hard so he could feel the sweet salt of the blood inside his lip . And I like that too , he thought . " Now I will comb my hair and make my mouth new and you can watch me . " " Do you want me to shut the windows ? " " No , " she said . " We will do it all in the cold . " " Who do you love ? " " You , " she said . " And we do n't have too much luck do we ? " " I do n't know , " the Colonel said . " Go ahead and comb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wash up for dinner . The bathroom was the only disappointing part of the room . Due to the exigencies of the Gritti having been built as a palace , there had been no site for bathrooms atthe time of building , and , later , when they were introduced , they had been built down the corridor and those entitled to use them gave due warning before-hand and water was heated and towels laid out . This bathroom had been cut , arbitrarily , from a corner of the room and it was a defensive , rather than an attackingbathroom , the Colonel felt . Washing , and forced to look in the mirror to check any traces of lipstick , he regarded his face . It looks as though it had been cut out of wood by an indifferent craftsman , he thought . He looked at the different welts and ridges that had come before they had plastic surgery , and at the thin , only to bep112observed by the initiate , lines of the excellent plastic operationsafter head wounds . Well , that is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . It is a damn poor offer . The only thing is that it is tanned , and that takes some of the curse off of it . But , Christ what an ugly man . He did not notice the old used steel of his eyes nor the small , long extending laugh wrinkles at the corners of his eyes , nor that his broken nose was like a gladiator 's in the oldest statues . Nor did he notice his basically kind mouth which could be truly ruthless . The hell with you , he said to the mirror . You beat-up , miserable . Should we rejoin the ladies ? He went out from the bathroom into the room , and he was as young as at his first attack . Every worthless thing had been left in the bathroom . As always , he thought . That 's the place for it . Ou sont les neiges d'antan ? Ou sont les neiges d'autre -- fois ? Dans le pissoir toute la chose comme fa . The girl whose first name was Renata , had the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside and she was combing her hair . She was not combing it for vanity , nor to do to the Colonel what she knew it could and would do . She was combing it with difficulty and without respect , and , since it was very heavy hair and as alive as the hair of peasants , or the hair of the beauties of the great nobility , it was resistant to the comb . " The wind made it very tangled , " she said . " Do you love me still ? "  | " Yes , " the Colonel said . " May I help you ? " " No , I 've done it all my life . " " You could stand sidewise . " " No . All contours are for our five sons and for your head to rest on . " " I was only thinking of the face , " the Colonel said . " But thank you for calling my attention . My attention has been faulty again . " " I am over bold . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make such things of wire and of sponge-rubber , such as you use in the seats of tanks . You never know there , whether there is any truth in the matter , unless you are a bad boy as I am . " Here it is not that way , " she said , and , with the comb , swung her now parted hair forward so that it came below the line of her cheek , and slanting back , hung over her shoulders . " Do you like it neat ? " " It 's not too neat but it is damn lovely . " " I could put it up and all that sort of thing if you value neatness . But I can not manage hairpins and it seems so silly . " Her voice was so lovely and it always reminded him of Pablo Casals playing the cello that it made him feel as a wound does that you think you can not bear . But you can bear anything , he thought . " I love you very much the way you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beautiful woman I have ever known , or seen , even in paintings by good painters . " " I wonder why the portrait has not come . "  | " The portrait is lovely to have , " the Colonel said , and now he was a General again without thinking of it . " But it is like skinning a dead horse . " " Please do n't be rough , " the girl said . " I do n't feel at all like being rough tonight . " " I slipped into the jargon of my sale metier . " " No , " she said . " Please put your arms around me . Gently and well . Please . It is not a dirty trade . It is the oldest and the best , although most people who practice it are un-worthy . " He held her as tight as he could without hurting and she said , " I would not have you be a lawyer nor a priest . Nor sell things . Nor be a great success . I love you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper to me if you wish . " The Colonel whispered ; holding her tight , and with his heart broken , honestly and fairly , in his whisper that was as barely audible as a silent dog whistle heard close to the ear , " I love you , devil . And you 're my Daughter , too . And I do n't care about our losses because the moon is our mother and our father . And now let 's go down to dinner . " He whispered this last so low that it was inaudible to anyone who did not love you . " Yes , " the girl said . " Yes . But kiss me once more first . " P115THEY were at their table in the far corner of the bar , where the Colonel had both his flanks covered , and he rested solidly against the corner of the room . The Gran Maestro knew about this , since he had been an excellent sergeant in a good company of infantry , in a first-rate regiment , and he would no more have seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have taken up a stupid defensive position . " The lobster , " the Gran Maestro said . The lobster was imposing . He was double the size a lobster should be , and his unfriendliness had gone with the boiling , so that now he looked a monument to his dead self ; complete with protruding eyes and his delicate , far-extendedantennae that were for knowing what rather stupid eyes could not tell him . He looks a little bit like Georgie Patton , the Colonel thought . But he probably never cried in his life when he was moved.  | " Do you think that he will be tough ? " he asked the girl in Italian . " No , " the Gran Maestro assured them , still bowing with the lobster . " He 's truly not tough . He 's only big . You know the type . " " All right , " the Colonel said . " Serve him . " " And what will you drink ? " " What do you want , Daughter ? " " What you want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Secco and really cold . " " I have it ready , " said the Gran Maestro . " We are having fun , " the girl said . " We are having it again and without sorrow . Is n't he an imposing lobster ? " " He is , " the Colonel answered . " And he better damn well be tender . " " He will be , " the girl told him . " The Gran Maestro does n't lie . Is n't it wonderful to have people who do not lie ? " " Very wonderful and quite rare , " the Colonel said . " I was thinking just now of a man named Georgie Patton who possibly never told the truth in his life . " " Do you ever lie ? " " I 've lied four times . But each time I was very tired . That 's not an excuse , " he added . " I lied a lot when I was a little girl . But mostly it was making up stories . Or I hope so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have , " said the Colonel . " Four times . "  | " Would you have been a general if you had not lied ? " " If I had lied as others lied , I would have been a threestargeneral . " " Would it make you happier to be a three-star general ? " " No , " said the Colonel . " It would not . " " Put your right hand , your real hand , in your pocket once and tell me how you feel . " The Colonel did so . " Wonderful , " he said . " But I have to give them back you know . " " No . Please no . " " We wo n't go into it now . " Just then the lobster was served . It was tender , with the peculiar slippery grace of that kicking muscle which is the tail , and the claws were excellent ; neither too thin , nor too fat . " A lobster fills with the moon , " the Colonel told the girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating . " " I did n't know that . " " I think it may be because , with the full moon , he feeds all night . Or maybe it is that the full moon brings him feed . " " They come from the Dalmatian coast do they not ? " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " That 's your rich coast in fish . Maybe I should say our rich coast . " " Say it , " the girl said . " You do n't know how important things that are said are . " " They are a damn sight more important when you put them on paper . "  | " No , " the girl said . " I do n't agree . The paper means nothing unless you say them in your heart . " " And what if you have n't a heart , or your heart is worthless ? " " You have a heart and it is not worthless . " I would sure as hell like to trade it in on a new one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , of all the muscles , should fail me . But he said nothing of this , and put his hand in his pocket . " They feel wonderful , " he said . " And you look won-derful . " " Thank you , " she said . " I will remember that all week . " " You could always just look in the glass . " " The mirror bores me , " she said . " Putting on lipstick and moving your mouths over each other to get it spread properly and combing your too heavy hair is not a life for a woman , or even a girl alone , who loves someone . When you want to be the moon and various stars and live with your man and have five sons , looking at yourself in the mirror and doing the artifices of a woman is not very exciting . " " Then let us be married at once . " " No , " she said . " I had to make a decision about that , as about the other different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions . " " I make them too , " the Colonel told her . " But I am very vulnerable on this . " " Let 's not talk about it . It makes a sweet hurt , but I think we would do better to find out what the Granp119Maestro has for meat . Please drink your wine . You have n't touched it . " " I 'll touch it now , " the Colonel said . He did and it was pale and cold like the wines of Greece , but not resinous , and its body was as full and as lovely as that of Renata . " It 's very like you . " " Yes . I know . That 's why I wanted you to taste it . " " I 'm tasting it , " the Colonel said . " Now I will drink a full glass . " " You 're a good man . " " Thank you , " the Colonel said . " I 'll remember that allweek and try to be one . " Then he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over , happy , conspiratorial , and ignoring his ulcers , the Colonel asked him , " What sort of meat have you that is worth our eating ? " " I 'm not quite sure I know , " the Gran Maestro said . " But I will check . Your compatriot is over there in hearingdistance . He would not let me seat him in the far corner . " " Good , " the Colonel said . " We 'll give him something to write about . " " He writes every night , you know . I 've heard that from one of my colleagues at his hotel . " " Good , " the Colonel said . " That shows that he is industriouseven if he has outlived his talents . " " We are all industrious , " the Gran Maestro said . " In different ways . " " I will go and check on what there actually is among the meats . " " Check carefully . "  | " I am industrious . " " You are also damn sagacious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He is a lovely man and I love how fond he is of you . " " We are good friends , " the Colonel said . " I hope he has a good steak for you . " " There is one very good steak , " the Gran Maestro said , reappearing . " You take it , Daughter . I get them all the time at the mess . Do you want it rare ? " " Quite rare , please . " " Al sangue , " the Colonel said , " as John said when he spoke to the waiter in French . Crudo , bleu , or just make it very rare . " It 's rare , " the Gran Maestro said . " And you , my Colonel ? " " The scaloppine with Marsala , and the cauliflower braised with butter . Plus an artichoke vinaigrette if you can find one . What do you want , Daughter ? " " Mashed potatoes and a plain salad . " " You 're a growing girl . " " Yes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions . " " I think that handles it , " the Colonel said . " What about a fiasco of Valpolicella ? " " We do n't have fiascos . This is a good hotel , you know . It comes in bottles . " " I forgot , " the Colonel said . " Do you remember when it cost thirty centesimi the liter ? "  | " And we would throw the empty fiascos at the station guards from the troop trains ? " " And we would throw all the left over grenades away and bounce them down the hillside coming back from the Grappa ? " " And they would think there was a break-through when they would see the bursts and you never shaved , and we wore the fiamme nere on the grey , open jackets with the grey sweaters ? " " And I drank grappa and could not even feel the taste ? " " We must have been tough then , " the Colonel said . " We were tough then , " the Gran Maestro said . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad boys . " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " I think we were rather bad boys . You forgive this will you , Daughter ? " " You have n't a picture of them , have you ? " " No . There were n't any pictures except with Mr. d'Annunzio in them . Also most of the people turned out badly . " " Except for us , " the Gran Maestro said . " Now I must go and see how the steak marches . " The Colonel , who was a sub-lieutenant again now , ridingin a camion , his face dust , until only his metallic eyes showed , and they were red-rimmed and sore , sat thinking . The three key points , he thought . The massif of Grappa with Assalone and Pertica and the hill I do not remember the name of on the right .

" " I fought enough to be classified as a fool by the great thinkers . " " Tell me . " " When I was a boy , I fought against Erwin Rommel half way from Cortina to the Grappa , where we held .

"  | " I understand , " the Colonel said . " But please , Daughter , you try to understand my attitude too . When we have killed so many we can afford to be kind . " " How many have you killed ? " " One hundred and twenty-two sures . Not counting possibles . " " You had no remorse ? " " Never . " " Nor bad dreams about it ? " " Nor bad dreams . But usually strange ones .

You can not have the one without the other . " " But you could give me privileges . " " You have them , " the Colonel said . " The stones are in my pocket . " The Gran Maestro came then with the steak and the scaloppine and the vegetables . They were brought by a sleek-headed boy who believed in nothing ; but was tryingp124hard to be a good second waiter . He was a member of the Order . The Gran Maestro served adroitly and with respect both for the food , and those that were to eat it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valpolicella , " he said to the boy who had the eyes of an unbelieving spaniel . " What do you have on that character ?

" " I never saw him before today , " the Colonel said . " He 's hard to take with food . " " He condescends to me . He speaks bad Italian assiduously . He goes everywhere in Baedeker , and he has no taste in either food or wine . The woman is nice . I believe she is his aunt . But I have no real information .

" " Of course not , " the girl said . " But I 'd rather Dante wrote it . "  | " Dante is n't around , " the Colonel said . " Can you tell me anything about the war ? " the girl asked . " Anything that I should be permitted to know ? " " Sure . Anything you like . " " What was General Eisenhower like ? " " Strictly the Epworth League . Probably that is unjust too .

Now chief of staff . " " But what about the great leaders we heard about like the Generals Montgomery and Patton ? " " Forget them , Daughter . Monty was a character who needed fifteen to one to move , and then moved tardily . " " I always supposed he was a great General . " " He was not , " the Colonel said . " The worst part was he knew it . I have seen him come into an hotel and change from his proper uniform into a crowd-catching kit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Do you dislike him ? " " No . I simply think he is a British General . Whatever that means . And do n't you use the term . " " But he beat General Rommel . " " Yes . And you do n't think any one else had softened him up ? And who ca n't win with fifteen to one ? When we fought here , when we were boys , the Gran Maestro and I , we won for one whole year with three to four against one and we won each one . Three main bad ones . That is why we can make jokes and not be solemn . We had something over one hundred and forty thousand dead that year . That is why we can speak gaily and without pomposity . " " It is such a sad science ; if it is a science , " the girl said . " I hate the war monuments , though I respect them . " " I do not like them either . Nor the process which led to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? " " No . But I would like to know . " " Better not know , " the Colonel said . " Eat your steak before it gets cold and forgive me for talking about my trade . " " I hate it but I love it . " " I believe we share the same emotions , " the Colonel said . " But what is my pitted compatriot thinking three tables down ? " " About his next book , or about what it says in Bae-deker . " " Should we go and ride in a gondola in the wind after we have dined ? " 127 " That would be lovely . " " Should we tell the pitted man that we are going ? I think he has the same pits on his heart and in his soul and maybe in his curiosity . " " We tell him nothing , " the girl said . " The Gran Maestro can convey him any information we wish . " Then she chewed well and solidly on her steak and said , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces after fifty ? " " I hope not . Because I would not sign for mine . " " You , " she said . " You . " " Is the steak good ? " the Colonel asked . " It 's wonderful . How are your scaloppine ? " " Very tender and the sauce is not at all sweet . Do you like the vegetables ? " " The cauliflower is almost crisp ; like celery . " " We should have some celery . But I do n't think there is any or the Gran Maestro would have brought it . " Do n't we have fun with food ? Imagine if we could eat together always . " " I 've suggested it . " " Let 's not talk about that . " " All right , " the Colonel said . " I 've made a decision too . I 'm going to chuck the army and live in this town , very simply , on my retirement pay . " " That 's wonderful . How do you look in civilian clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know it , my dear . I said it for a joke . You make rough jokes sometimes too , you know . " " I 'll look all right . That is if you have a tailor here who can cut clothes . " " There is n't one here , but there is in Rome . Can we drive together to Rome to get the clothes ? " " Yes . And we will live outside the town at Viterbo and only go in for the fittings and for dinner in the evening . Then we 'll drive back in the night . " " Will we see cinema people and speak about them with candour and perhaps not have a drink with them ? " " We 'll see them by the thousands . " " Will we see them being married for the second and third time and then being blessed by the Pope ? " " If you go in for that kind of thing . " " I do n't , " the girl said . " That 's one reason that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel said . " Thank you . " " But I will love you , whatever that means , and you and I know what it means very well , as long as either of us is alive and after . " " I do n't think you can love very much after you , yourself , are dead , " the Colonel said . He started to eat the artichoke , taking a leaf at a time , and dipping them , heavy side down , into the deep saucer of sauce vinaigrette . " I do n't know whether you can either , " the girl said . " But I will try . Do n't you feel better to be loved ? " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " I feel as though I were out onp129some bare-assed hill where it was too rocky to dig , and the rocks all solid , but with nothing jutting , and no bulges , and all of a sudden instead of being there naked , I was armoured . Armoured and the eighty-eights not there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the craters of the moon face so he could write it tonight . " " I ought to tell it to Dante if he was around , " the Colonel , suddenly gone as rough as the sea when a line squall comes up , said . " I 'd tell him what I 'd do if I were shifted , or ascended , into an armoured vehicle under such circumstances . " Just then the Barone Alvarito came into the dining room . He was looking for them and , being a hunter , he saw them Instantly . He came over to the table and kissed Renata 's hand , saying , " Ciao , Renata . " He was almost tall , beautifully built in his town clothes , and he was the shyest man the Colonel had ever known . He was not shy from ignorance , nor from being ill at ease , nor from any defect . He was basically shy , as certain animals are , such as the Bongo that you will never see in the jungle , and that must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He smiled as only the truly shy can smile . It was not the easy grin of the confident , nor the quick slashing smile of the extremely durable and the wicked . It had no relation with the poised , intently . used smile of the courtesan or the politician . It was the strange , rare smile which rises from the deep , dark pit , deeper than a well , deep as a deep mine , that is within them.  | " I can only stay a moment . I came to tell you that it looks quite good for the shoot . The ducks are coming in heavily from the north . There are many big ducks . The ones you like , " he smiled again . " Sit down Alvarito . Please . " " No , " the Barone Alvarito said . " We can meet at the Garage at two-thirty if you like ? You have your car ? " " Yes . " " That makes it very good . Leaving at that hour , we will have time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Colonel said . " Ciao , then , Renata . Good-bye , my Colonel . Until two-thirty . " " We knew each other as children , " the girl said . " But he was about three years older . He was born very old . " " Yes . I know . He is a good friend of mine . " " Do you think your compatriot has looked him up in Baedeker ? " " I would n't know , " the Colonel said . " Gran Maestro , " he asked , " did my illustrious compatriot look up the Barone in Baedeker ? " " Truly , my Colonel . I have not seen him pull his Baedeker during the meal . " " Give him full marks , " the Colonel said . " Now look . I believe that the Valpolicella is better when it is newer . It is not a grand vin and bottling it and putting years on it only adds sediment . Do you agree ? " " I agree . " " Then what should we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a Great Hotel , wine must cost money . You can not get Pinard at the Ritz . But I suggest that we get several fiascos of the good . You can say they come from the Contessa Renata 's estates and are a gift . Then I will have them decanted for you . This way , we will have better wine and make an impressive saving . I will explain it to the manager if you like . He is a very good man . " Explain it to him , " the Colonel said . " He 's not a man who drinks labels either . " " Agreed . " " In the meantime you might as well drink this . It is very good , you know . " " It is , " the Colonel said . " But it is n't Chambertin . " " What did we use to drink ? " " Anything , " the Colonel said . " But now I seek perfection . Or , rather , not absolute perfection , but perfection for my money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gran Maestro said . " But rather vainly . " " What do you want for the end of the meal ? " " Cheese , " the Colonel said . " What do you want , Daughter ? " The girl had been quiet and a little withdrawn , since she had seen Alvarito . Something was going pn in her mind , and it was an excellent mind . But , momentarily , she was not with them . " Cheese , " she said . " Please . " " What cheese ? "  | " Bring them all and we 'll look at them , " the Colonel said . The Gran Maestro left and the Colonel said , " What 's the matter , Daughter ? " " Nothing . Never anything . Always nothing . " " You might as well pull out of it . We have n't time for such luxuries . " " No . I agree . We will devote ourselves to the cheese . " " Do I have to take it like a corn cob ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but understanding exactly what was meant , since it was she who had been doing the thinking . " Put your right hand in your pocket . " " Good , " the Colonel said . " I will . " He put his right hand in his pocket and felt what was there , first with the tips of his fingers , and then with the insides of his fingers , and then with the palm of his hand ; his split hand . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " And now we begin the good part of it again . We will dedicate ourselves to the cheese with happiness . " " Excellent , " the Colonel said . " I wonder what cheeses he has ? " " Tell me about the last war , " the girl said . " Then we will ride in our gondola in the cold wind . " " It was not very interesting , " the Colonel said . " To us , of course , such things are always interesting . But there were only three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why ? "  | " We were fighting a beaten enemy whose communicationshad been destroyed . We destroyed many divisions on paper , but they were ghost divisions . Not real ones . They had been destroyed by our tactical aviation before they ever got up . It was only really difficult in Normandy , due to the terrain , and when we made the break for Georgie Patton 's armour to go through and held it open on both sides . " " How do you make a break for armour to go through ? Tell me , please . " " First you fight to take a town that controls all the main roads . Call the town St. Lo . Then you have to open up the roads by taking other towns and villages . The enemy has a main line of resistance , but he can not bring up his divisions to counter-attack because the fighter-bombers catch them on the roads . Does this bore you ? It bores the hell out of me . " " It does not bore me . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Colonel said . " Are you sure you want more of the sad science ? " " Please , " she said . " I love you , you know , and I would like to share it with you . " " Nobody shares this trade with anybody , " the Colonel told her . " I 'm just telling you how it works . I can insert anecdotes to make it interesting , or plausible . " " Insert some , please . " " The taking of Paris was nothing , " the Colonel said . " It was only an emotional experience . Not a military opera/tion . We killed a number of typists and the screen the Germans had left , as they always do , to cover their withdrawal . I suppose they figured they were not going to need a hell of a lot of office workers any more and they left them as soldiers . " " Was it not a great thing ? " " The people of Leclerc , another jerk of the third or fourth water , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shot a great number of rounds to make it seem important and because we had given them what they had to shoot with . But it was not important . " " Did you take part in it ? " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " I think I could safely say , yes . " " Did you have no great impressions of it ? After all , it was Paris and not everyone has taken it . " " The French , themselves , had taken it four days before . But the grand plan of what we called SHAEF , Supreme , get that word , Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces , which included all the military politicians of the rear , and who wore a badge of shame in the form of a flaming something , while we wore a four-leafed clover as a designation , and for luck , we had to wait for the possible arrival of General or Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery who was unable to close , even , the gap at Falaise and found the going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You must have missed him , " the girl said . " Oh , we did , " the Colonel said . " No end . "  | " But was there nothing noble or truly happy about it ? " " Surely , " the Colonel told her . " We fought from Bas Meudon , and then the Porte de Saint Cloud , through streets I knew and loved and we had no deads and did as little damage as possible . At the Etoile I took Elsa Maxwell 's butler prisoner . It was a very complicated operation . He had been denounced as a Japanese sniper . A new thing . Several Parisians were alleged to have been killed by him . So we sent three men to the roof where he had taken refuge and he was an Indo-China boy . " " I begin to understand a little . But it is disheartening . " " It is always disheartening as hell . But you are not supposedto have a heart in this trade . " " But do you think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I am quite sure it was worse . " " But you got your hand honorably ? " " Yes . Very honorably . On a rocky , bare-assed hill . " " Please let me feel it , " she said . " Just be careful around the center , " the Colonel said . " It 's split there and it still cracks open . " " You ought to write , " the girl said . " I mean it truly . So someone would know about such things . " " No , " the Colonel disagreed . " I have not the talent for it and I know too much . Almost any liar writes ' more convincingly than a man who was there . " " But other soldiers wrote . " " Yes . Maurice de Saxe . Frederick the Great . Mr. T'sun Su. "  | " But soldiers of our time . " " You use the word our with facility . I like it though . " " But did n't many modern soldiers write ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . I have read mostly the classics and I read the illustrated papers for the scandals . Also , I read your let-ters . " " Burn them , " the Colonel said . " They are worthless . " " Please . Do n't be rough . " " I wo n't . What can I tell you that wo n't bore you ? " " Tell me about when you were a General . " " Oh , that , " he said and motioned to the Gran Maestro to bring Champagne . It was Roederer Brut ' 42 and he loved it . " When you are a general you live in a trailer and your Chief of Staff lives in a trailer , and you have bourbon whisky when other people do not have it . Your G 's live in the C.P. I 'd tell you what G 's are , but it would bore you . I 'd tell you about G1 , Gz , G3 , G4 , G5 and on the other side there is always Kraut-6 . But it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map covered with plastic material , and on this you have three regiments composed of three battalions each . It is all marked in colored pencil . " You have boundary lines so that when the battalions cross their boundaries they will not then fight each other . Each battalion is composed of five companies . All should be good , but some are good , and some are not so good . Also you have divisional artillery and a battalion of tanks and many spare parts . You live by co-ordinates. "  |p137He  paused while the Gran Maestro poured the Roederer Brut ' 42 . " From Corps , " he translated , unlovingly , cuerpo d'Armata , " they tell you what you must do , and then you decide how to do it . You dictate the orders or , most often , you give them by telephone . You ream out people you respect , to make them do what you know is fairly impossible , but is ordered . Also , you have to think hard , stay awake late and get up early . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even to please me ? " " No , " said the Colonel . " Boys who were sensitive and cracked and kept all their valid first impressions of their day of battle , or their three days , or even their four , write books . They are good books but can be dull if you have been there . Then others write to profit quickly from the war they never fought in . The ones who ran back to tell the news . The news is hardly exact . But they ran quickly with it . Professional writers who had jobs that prevented them from fighting wrote of combat that they could not understand , as though they had been there . I do not know what category of sin that comes under . " Also a nylon-smooth Captain of the Navy who could not command a cat-boat wrote about the intimate side of the truly Big Picture . Everybody will write their book sooner or later . We might even draw a good one . But I do n't write , Daughter . " He motioned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maestro , " he said . " Do you like to fight ? "  | " No . " " But we fought ? " " Yes . Too much . " " How is your health ? " " Wonderful except for the ulcers and a small cardiac condition . " " No , " the Colonel said , and his heart rose and he felt it choke him . " You only told me about the ulcers . " " Well you know now , " the Gran Maestro said and did , not finish the sentence and he smiled his best and clearest smile that came as solid as the sun rises . " How many times ? " The Gran Maestro held up two fingers as a man might do giving odds where he had credit , and all the betting was on the nod . " I 'm ahead of you , " the Colonel said . " But let 's not be macabre . Ask Donna Renata if she wishes more of this excellentwine . " " You did not tell me there were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me to tell me . " " There has been nothing since we were together last . " " Do you think it breaks for me ? If so , I would come and simply be with you and care for you . " " It 's just a muscle , " the Colonel said . " Only it is the main muscle . It works as perfectly as a Rolex Oyster Perpetual . The trouble is you can not send it to the Rolex representativewhen it goes wrong . When it stops , you just do not know the time . You 're dead . " " Do n't please talk about it . " " You asked me , " the Colonel said.  | " And that pitted man with the caricature face ? He has no such thing ? " " Of course not , " the Colonel told her . " If he is a mediocrewriter he will live forever . " " But you 're not a writer . How do you know this ? " " No , " the Colonel said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several books . We have a lot of time to read when we are unmarried . Not as much as the merchant marine maybe . But plenty . I can tell one writer from another and I tell you that a mediocre writer has a long span of life . They ought to all draw longevity pay . " " Could you tell me any anecdotes , and we stop talking about this , which is my true sorrow ? " " I can tell you hundreds of them . All true . " " Tell me just one . Then we will finish this wine and then go in the gondola . " " Do you think you will be warm enough ? " " Oh , I 'm sure I will . " " I do n't know what to tell you , " the Colonel said . " Everything about war bores those who have not made it . Except the tales of the liars . " " I would like to know about the taking of Paris . " " Why ? Because I told you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . I was complimented by that and I know we are a little alike in profile . But I have never been in any tumbril , and I would like to hear about Paris . When you love someone and he is your hero , you like to hear about the places and the things . " " Please turn your head , " the Colonel said , " ap140tell you . Gran Maestro is there any more in that wretched bottle ? " " No , " the Gran Maestro answered . " Then bring another . " " I have one already iced . " " Good . Serve it . Now , Daughter , we parted from the column of the General Leclerc at Clamart . They went to Montrouge and the Porte d'Orleans and we went directly to Bas Meudon and secured the bridge of the Porte de Saint Cloud . Is this too technical and does it bore you ? " " No . " " It would be better with a map . " " Go on . " " We secured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river and we threw the Germans , living and dead , who had defended the bridge , into the Seine River , " he stopped . " It was a token defense of course . They should have blown it . We threw all these Germans into the River Seine . They were nearly all office workers , I believe . " " Go on . " " The next morning , we were informed that the Germans had strong points at various places , and artillery on Mount Valerien , and that tanks were roaming the streets . A portion of this was true . We were also requested not to enter too rapidly as the General Leclerc was to take the city . I compliedwith this request and entered as slowly as I could . " " How do you do that ? " " You hold up your attack two hours and you drinkp141champagne whenever it is offered to you by patriots , collaborators or enthusiasts . " " But was there nothing wonderful nor great , the way it is in books ? " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very happy . Old general officers were walking about in their moth-balled uniforms . We were very happy , too , not to have to fight . " " Did you not have to fight at all ? " " Only three times . Then not seriously . " " But was that all you had to fight to take such a city ? " " Daughter , we fought twelve times from Rambouillet to enter the city . But only two of them were worth describing as fights . Those at Toussus le Noble and at LeBuc . The rest was the necessary garnishing of a dish . I really did not need to fight at all except at those two places . " " Tell me some true things about fighting . " " Tell me you love me . " " I love you , " the girl said . " You can publish it in the Gazzettino if you like . I love your hard , flat body and your strange eyes that frighten me when they become wicked . I love your hand and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you something pretty good , " the Colonel said . " First I can tell you that I love you Period . " " Why do n't you buy some good glass ? " the girl asked , suddenly . " We could go to Murano together . " " I do n't know anything about glass . " " I could teach you . It would be fun . "  | " But when you retire and live here . " " We 'll get some then . " " I wish that that was now . " " So do I , except that I go duck shooting tomorrow and that tonight is tonight . " " Can I come duck shooting ? " " Only if Alvarito asks you . " " I can make him ask me . " " I doubt that . " " It is n't polite to doubt what your Daughter says when she is old enough not to lie . " " All right , Daughter . I withdraw the doubt . " " Thank you . For that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in Venice and go to Mass with Mother and my aunt and my great-aunt and visit my poors . I am an only child so I have many duties . " " I always wondered what you did . " " That 's what I do . Also , I 'll have my maid wash my head and give me a manicure and a pedicure . " " You ca n't do that because the shoot is on Sunday . " " Then I 'll do that on Monday . On Sunday , I will read all the illustrated papers including the outrageous ones . " " Maybe they 'll have pictures of Miss Bergman . Do you still want to be like her ? " " Not any more , " the girl said . " I want to be like me only much , much better and I want to have you love me . " " Also , " she said suddenly and unmaskingly , " I want to be like you . Can I be like you a little while tonight ? "  | " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town are we anyway ? " " Venice , " she said . " The best town , I think . " " I quite agree . And thank you for not asking me for more war episodes . " " Oh you are going to have to tell them to me later . " " Have to ? " the Colonel said and the cruelty and resolutionshowed in his strange eyes as clearly as when the hooded muzzle of the gun of a tank swings toward you . " Did you say have to , Daughter ? " " I said it . But I did not mean it in that way . Or , if I did wrong , I am sorry . I meant will you please tell me more true episodes later ? And explain me the things I do not understand ? " " You can use have to if you want , Daughter . The hell with it . " He smiled and his eyes were as kind as they ever were , which was not too kind , as he knew . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to be kind to his last and true and only love . " I do n't really mind , Daughter . Please believe me . I know about command and , at your age , I used to take considerable pleasure in exercising it . " " But I do n't want to command , " the girl said . In spite of her resolution not to cry , her eyes were wet . " I wish to serve you . " " I know . But you wish to command , too . There 's nothingwrong in that . All people such as us have it . " " Thank you for the such as us . "   " It was n't hard to say , " the Colonel said . " Daughter , " he added . Just then the concierge came to the table and said , " Excuse me , my Colonel . There is a man outside , I believe he is a servant of yours , my Lady , with quite a large packagewhich he says is for the Colonel . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your room ? " " To my room , " the Colonel said . " Please , " the girl said . " Ca n't we look at it here ? We do n't care about anyone here , do we ? " " Have it unwrapped and brought in here . " " Very good . " " Later , you may have it taken with great care to my room and have it wrapped , solidly , for transport at noon tomorrow . " " Very good , my Colonel . " " Are you excited to see it ? " the girl asked . " Very , " said the Colonel . " Gran Maestro some more of that Roederer , please , and please place a chair in such a position that we may view a portrait . We are devotees of the pictorial arts . " " There 's no more Roederer cold , " the Gran Maestro said . " But if you would like some Perrier-Jouet  --  " " Bring it , " the Colonel said and added , " Please . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel told her . " I do n't have to . And besides he 's dead . " " Poor man . " " Yes , Poor man all his life . Although quite rich in money and with a lot of armour. "  | " Do you have anything against armour ? " " Yes . Most of the people inside of it . It makes men into bullies which is the first step toward cowardice ; true cowardice I mean . Perhaps it is a little complicated by claustrophobia . " Then he looked at her and smiled and regretted taking her beyond her depth , as you might take a new swimmer on a shallow , shelving beach , into too deep water ; and he sought to reassure her . " You forgive me , Daughter . Much of what I say is unjust . But it is truer than the things that you will read in Generals ' memoirs . After a man gets one star , or more , the truth becomes as difficult for him to attain as the Holy Grail was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general officer . " " Not for too damn long , " the Colonel said . " Now Captains , " the General said , " they know the exact truth and they can mostly tell it to you . If they ca n't , you reclassify them . " " Would you reclassify me if I lied ? " " It would depend on what you lied about . " " I 'm not going to lie about anything . I do n't want to be reclassified . It sounds horrible . " " It is , " the Colonel said . " And you send them back to have it done to them with eleven different copies of why it should be done , every one of which you sign . " " Did you reclassify many ? " " Plenty . " The concierge came into the room with the portrait ,  |p146carrying  it in its big frame , much as a ship moves when she is carrying too much sail . " Get two chairs , " the Colonel said to the second waiter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not touch the chairs . And hold it so it does not slip . " Then to the girl he said , " We 'll have to change that frame . " " I know , " she said . " It was not my choice . Take it unframedwith you and we 'll choose a good frame next week . Now look at it . Not at the frame . At what it says , or does not say , of me . " It was a beautiful portrait ; neither cold , nor snobbish , nor stylised , nor modern . It was the way you would want your girl painted if Tintoretto were still around and , if he were not around , you settled for Velasquez . It was not the way either of them painted . It was simply a splendidportrait painted , as they sometimes are , in our time . " It 's wonderful , " the Colonel said . " It is , truly lovely . " The concierge and the second waiter ere holding it , and looking at it around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American , two tables down , was looking at it with his journalistic eyes , wondering who painted it . The back of the canvas was to the other diners . " It is wonderful , " the Colonel said . " But you ca n't give me that . " " I already have , " the girl said . " I 'm sure my hair was never that long over my shoulders . " " I think it probably was . " " I could try to let it get that long if you want . "   " Try , " the Colonel said . " You great beauty you . I love you very much . You and you portrayed on canvas . " " Tell the waiters if you like . I 'm sure it wo n't come as a great shock to them . " " Take the canvas upstairs to my room , " the Colonel said to the concierge . " Thank you very much for bringing it in . If the price is right , I am going to buy it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to him . " Should we have them take it and the chairs down and make a special showing of it for your compatriot ? The Gran Maestro could tell him the address of the painter and he could visit the picturesque studio . " " It is a very lovely portrait , " the Gran Maestro said . " But it should be taken to the room . One should never let Roederer or Perrier-Jouet do the talking . " " Take it to the room , please . " " You said please without a pause before it . " " Thank you , " the Colonel said . " I am very deeply moved by the portrait and I am not entirely responsible for what I say . " " Let 's neither of us be responsible . " " Agreed , " the Colonel said . " The Gran Maestro is really very responsible . He always was . " " No , " the girl said . " I think he did not only from responsibilitybut from malice . We all have malice , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think perhaps he did not want the man to have even a journalist 's look into happiness . " " Whatever that is. "  | " I learned that phrase from you , and now you have re-learned it back from me . " " That 's the way it goes , " the Colonel said . " What you win in Boston you lose in Chicago . " " I do n't understand that at all . " " Too hard to explain , " the Colonel said . Then , " No . Of course it is n't . Making things clear is my main trade . The hell with being too hard to explain . It is like professionalfootball , calcio , What you win in Milano you lose in Torino . " " I do n't care about football . " " Neither do I , " the Colonel said . " Especially not about the Army and Navy game and when the very high brass speaks in terms of American football so they can understand , themselves , what they are talking of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . Even under the circumstances , whatever they are . " " Should we take this new bottle in the gondola ? " " Yes , " the girl said . " But with deep glasses . I 'll tell the Gran Maestro . Let 's get our coats and go . " " Good . I 'll take some of this medicine and sign for the G.M. and we 'll go . " " I wish it was me taking the medicine instead of you . " " I 'm glad as hell it is n't , " the Colonel said . " Should we pick our gondola or have them bring one to the land-ing ? " " Let 's gamble and have them bring one to the landing . What do we have to lose ? " " Nothing , I guess . Probably nothing . " P149THEY went out the side door of the hotel to the imbarcaderoand the wind hit them . The light from the hotel shone on the blackness of the gondola and made the water green . She looks as lovely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel thought . Why have I never seen a gondola before ? What hand or eye framed that dark-ed symmetry ? " Where should we go ? " the girl asked . Her hair , in the light from the hotel door and window , as she stood on the dock by the black gondola , was blowingback in the wind , so she looked like the figure-head on a ship . The rest of it , too , the Colonel thought . " Let 's just ride through the park , " the Colonel said . " Or through the Bois with the top down . Let him take us out to Armenonville . " " Will we go to Paris ? " " Sure , " the Colonel said . " Tell him to take us for anp150hour where the going is easiest . I do n't want to drive him into that wind . " " The tide is quite high with this wind , " the girl said . " Some of our places he could n't get under the bridges . May I tell him where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Stow that ice bucket aboard , " the Colonel said to the second waiter , who had come out with them . " The Gran Maestro said to tell you , as you embarked , that this bottle of wine was his present . " " Thank him properly and tell him he ca n't do that . " " He had better go into the wind a little first , " the girl said . " Then I know how he should go . " " The Gran Maestro sent this , " the second waiter said . It was a folded , old U. S. O. D. blanket . Renata was talking to the gondoliere , her hair blowing . The gondoliere wore a heavy blue navy sweater and he was bare-headed too . " Thank him , " the Colonel said . He slipped a bill into the second waiter 's hand . The second waiter returned it . " You already made the notation on the check . Neither you nor I nor the Gran Maestro are starving . " " What about the moglie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Your mediums smacked our house in Treviso . " " I 'm sorry . " " You need n't be , " the second waiter said . " You were a foot soldier as I was . "  | " Permit me to be sorry . " " Sure , " the second waiter said . " And what the hell difference does it make ? Be happy , my Colonel , and be happy , my Lady . " They got down into the gondola and there was the same magic , as always , of the light hull , and the sudden displacement that you made , and then the trimming in the dark privacy , and then the second trimming , as the gondoliere started to scull , laying her partly on her side so that he would have more control . " Now , " the girl said . " We are in our home and I love you . Please kiss me and put all love into it . " The Colonel held her close , with her head thrown back and kissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I love you . " " Whatever that means , " she interrupted . " I love you and I know whatever that means . The picture is lovely . But there is no word for what you are . " " Wild ? " she said . " Or careless or unkempt ? " " No . " " The last was one of the first words I learned from my governess . It means you do not comb your hair enough . Neglectful is when you do not brush one hundred strokes at night . " " I 'm going to run my hand through it and make it unkempterstill . " " Your hurt hand ? "  | " Yes . " " We 're sitting on the wrong sides for that . Change over . " " Good . That is a sensible order couched in simple language and easily understood . " It was fun moving over , trying not to disturb the balance of the gondola , but having to trim again carefully . " Now , " she said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know just what you want ? " " I do indeed . Is it un-maidenly ? I learned that word too from my governess . " " No , " he said . " It 's lovely . Pull up the blanket good and feel that wind . " " It 's from the high mountains . " " Yes . And beyond there it 's from somewhere else . " The Colonel heard the slap of the waves , and he felt the wind come sharply , and the rough familiarity of the blanket , and then he felt the girl cold-warm and lovely and with upraised breasts that his left hand coasted lightly over . Then he ran his bad hand through her hair once , twice , and three times and then he kissed her , and it was worse than desperation . " Please , " she said , from almost underneath the blanket . " Let me kiss now . " " No , " he said . " Me again . " The wind was very cold and lashed their faces but under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand that searched for the island in the great river with the high steep banks . " That 's it , " she said . He kissed her then and he searched for the island , findingit and losing it , and then finding it for good . For good and for bad , he thought , and for good and for all . " My darling , " he said . " My well beloved . Please . " " No . Just hold me very tight and hold the high ground , too . The Colonel said nothing , because he was assisting , or had made an act of presence , at the only mystery that he believed in except the occasional bravery of man . " Please do n't move , " the girl said . " Then move a great amount . " The Colonel , lying under the blanket in the wind , knowing it is only what man does for woman that he retains , except what he does for his fatherland or his motherland , however you get the reading , proceeded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think I can stand it . " " Do n't think of anything . Do n't think of anything at all . " " I 'm not . " " Do n't think . " " Oh please let 's not talk . " " Is it right ? " " You know . " " You 're sure . " " Oh please not talk . Please . "  |p154Yes  , he thought . Please and please again . She said nothing , and neither did he , and when the great bird had flown far out of the closed window of the gondola , and was lost and gone , neither of them said anything . He held her head lightly with his good arm and the other arm held the high ground now . " Please put it where it should be , " she said . " Your hand . " " Should we ? " " No . Just hold me tight and try to love me true . " " I love you true , " he said , and just then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wind was on his right cheek , and he said , with his old eyes catching the outline of the Palace where they turned , and noting it , " You 're in the lee now , Daughter . " " But it is too soon now . Do n't you know how a woman feels ? " " No . Only what you tell me . " " Thank you for the you . But do n't you really know ? " " No . I never asked , I guess . " " Guess now , " she said . " And please wait until after we have gone under the second bridge . " " Take a glass of this , " the Colonel said , reaching accuratelyand well for the champagne bucket with the ice , and uncorking the bottle the Gran Maestro had uncorked , and then placed a common wine cork in . " This is good for you , Daughter . It is good for all the ills that all of us have , and for all sadness and indecision . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking grammatically as her governess had taught her . " I am just a woman , or ap155girl , or whatever that is , doing whatever it is she should not do . Let 's do it again , please , now I am in the lee . " " Where is the island now and in what river ? " " You are making the discovery . I am only the unknown country . " " Not too unknown , " the Colonel said . " Please do n't be rude , " the girl said . " And please attack gently and with the same attack as before . " " It 's no attack , " the Colonel said . " It is something else . " " Whatever it is , whatever it is , while I 'm still in the lee . " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " Yes , now if you want , or will accept from kindness . " " Please , yes . " She talks like a gentle cat , though the poor cats can not speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he did not think for a long time . The gondola now was in one of the secondary canals . When it had turned from the Grand Canal , the wind had swung it so the gondoliere had to shift all his weight as ballast , and the Colonel and the girl had shifted too , under the blanket , with the wind getting under the edge of the blanket ; wildly . They had not spoken for a long time and the Colonel had noted that the gondola had only inches free in passing under the last bridge . " How are you , Daughter ? " " I 'm quite lovely . " " Do you love me ? "  | " Please do n't ask such silly things . " " The tide is very high and we only just made that last bridge . " " I think I know where we are going . I was born here . " " I 've made mistakes in my home town , " the Colonel said . " Being born there is n't everything . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know that . Please hold me very tightly so we can be a part of each other for a little while . " We can try , " the Colonel said . " Could n't I be you ? " " That 's awfully complicated . We could try of course . " " I 'm you now , " she said . " And I just took the city of Paris . " " Jesus , Daughter , " he said . " You 've got an awful lot of problems on your hands . The next thing , they will parade the twenty-eighth division through . " " I do n't care . " " I do . " " Were they not good ? " " Sure . They had fine commanders , too . But they were National Guard and hard luck . What you call a T.S . division . Get your T.S . slip from the Chaplain . " " I understand none of those things . " " They are n't worth explaining , " the Colonel said . " Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much and when I think of you taking it , then , it is asthough I were riding in this gondola with Marechal Ney . " " A no good job , " the Colonel said . " Anyway , not afterp157he fought all those rear-guard actions coming back from that big Russian town . He used to fight ten , twelve , fifteen times a day . Maybe more . Afterwards , he could n't recognizepeople . Please do n't get in any gondolas with him . " " He was always one of my great heroes . " " Yeah . Mine too . Until Quatre Bras . Maybe it was n't Quatre Bras . I 'm getting rusty . Give it the generic title of Waterloo . " " Was he bad there ? " " Awful , " the Colonel told her . " Forget it . Too many rear-guard actions coming back from Moskova . " " But they called him the bravest of the brave . " " You ca n't eat on that . You have to be that , always , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a lot of stuff coming up . " " Tell me about Paris , please . We should not make more love , I know . " " I do n't know it . Who says it ? " " I say it because I love you . " " All right . You said it and you love me . So we act on that . The hell with it . " " Do you think we could once more if it would not hurt you ? " " Hurt me ? " the Colonel said . " When the hell was I ever hurt ? "  | " PLEASE do n't be bad , " she said , pulling the blanket over them both . " Please drink a glass of this with me . You know you 've been hurt . " " Exactly , " the Colonel said . " Let 's forget it . " " All right , " she said . " I learned that word , or those two words from you . We have forgotten it . " " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placing it where he should . " Please do n't pretend to be stupid , and please let 's not think of anything , or anything , or anything . " " I am stupid , " the Colonel said . " But I wo n't think of anything or anything nor of nothing nor of his brother , tomorrow . " " Please be good and kind . " " I will be . And I will tell you , now , a military secret . Top Secret equals British Most Secret . I love you . " " That 's nice , " she said . " And you put it nicely . "  | " I 'm nice , " the Colonel said , and checked on the bridge that was coming up , and saw there was clearance . " That 's the first thing people notice about me . " " I always use the wrong words , " the girl said . " Please just love me . I wish it was me who could love you . " " You do . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all my heart . " They were going with the wind now and they were both tired . " Do you think  --  " " I do n't think , " the girl said . " Well try and think . " " I will . " " Drink a glass of this . " " Why not ? It 's very good . " It was . There was still ice in the bucket , and the wine was cold and clear . " Can I stay at the Gritti ? " " No . " " Why not ? " " It would n't be right . For them . Nor you . The hell with me . " " Then I suppose I should go home . " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " That is the logical supposition . " " That is an awful way to say a sad thing . Ca n't we even pretend some things ? " " No . I 'll take you home and you sleep good and well and tomorrow we will meet where and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " Of course . I 'll always be awake . Will you call when you are awake ? " " Yes . But why do you always wake so early ? " " It is a business habit . " " Oh , I wish you were not in that business , and that you were not going to die . " " So do I , " said the Colonel . " But I 'm getting out of the business . " " Yes , " she said , sleepily and comfortably . " Then we go to Rome and get the clothes . " " And live happily ever after . " " Please do n't , " she said . " Please , please , do n't . You know I made the resolution not to cry . " " You 're crying now , " the Colonel said . " What the hell have you got to lose on that resolution ? " " Take me home please . " " That 's what I was doing in the first place , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I will , " the Colonel said . After they , or the Colonel , rather , had paid the gondolierewho was unknowing , yet knowing all , solid , sound , respectful and trustworthy , they walked into the Piazzetta and then across the great , cold , wind-swept square that was hard and old under their feet . They walked holding close and hard in their sorrow and their happiness . " This is the place where the German shot the pigeons , " the girl said . " We probably killed him , " the Colonel said . " Or hisp161brother . Maybe we hanged him . I would n't know . I 'm not in C.I.D . " " Do you love me still on these water-worn , cold and old stones ? " " Yes . I 'd like to spread a bed roll here and prove it . " " That would be more barbarous than the pigeon shooter . " " I 'm barbarous , " the Colonel said . " Not always . " " Thank you for the not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I know that . When are they going to tear that damned Cinema Palace down and put up a real cathedral ? That 's what T5 Jackson wants . " " When some one brings Saint Mark back another time under a load of pork from Alexandria . " " That was a Torcello boy . " " You 're a Torcello boy . " " Yes . I 'm a Basso Piave boy and a Grappa boy straight here from Pertica . I 'm a Pasubio boy , too , if you know what that means . It was worse just to live there than to fight anywhere else . In the platoon they used to share anyone 's gonococci brought from Schio and carried in a matchbox . They used to share this just so they could leave because it was intolerable . " " But you stayed . " " Sure , " the Colonel said . " I 'm always the last man to leave the party , fiesta I mean , not as in political party . The truly unpopular guest . " " Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up your mind . " " I had . But when you said it about unpopular guest it was unmade . " " Keep it made up . " " I can hold a decision . " " I know . You can hold any damn thing . But , Daughter , sometimes you do n't just hold . That is for stupids . Sometimesyou have to switch fast . " " I 'll switch if you like . " " No . I think the decision was sound . " " But wo n't it be an awfully long time until morning ? " " That all depends on whether one has luck or not . " " I should sleep well . " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " At your age if you ca n't sleep they ought to take you out and hang you . " " Oh please . " " Sorry , " he said . " I meant shoot you . " " We are nearly home and you could be kind now if you wanted . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . " They were in front of the palace now and there it was ; the palace . There was nothing to do now but pull the bell cord , or enter with the key . I 've been lost in this place , the Colonel thought , and I was never lost in my life . " Please kiss me good-night , kindly . " The Colonel did and loved her so he could not bear it . She opened the door with the key , which was in herbag . Then she was gone and the Colonel was alone , withthe worn pavement , the wind , which still held in thep163north , and the shadows from where a light went on . He walked home . Only tourists and lovers take gondolas , he thought . Except to cross the canal in the places where there are no bridges . I ought to go to Harry 's , probably , or some damn place . But I think I 'll go home.  |p164I  T WAS really home , if a hotel room can be so described . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of Valpolicella by the reading light , and by the bed a bottle of mineral water , in an ice bucket with a glass beside it on the silver tray . The portrait had been de-framed and was placed on two chairs where he could see it from the bed . The Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune lay on the bed beside his three pillows . He used three pillows , as Arnaldo knew , and his extra bottle of medicine , not the one that he carried in his pocket , was beside the reading light . The inner doors of the armoire , the mirrored ones , were opened in such a way , that he could see the portrait from the side . His scuffed slippers were by the bed . I 'll buy it , the Colonel said , to himself , since there was no one else there except the portrait . He opened the Valpolicella which had been uncorked , and then re-corked , carefully , precisely , and lovingly , andp165poured himself a glass into the glass which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with breakage . " Here 's to you , Daughter , " he said . " You beauty and lovely . Do you know , that , among other things , you smell good always ? You smell wonderfully even in a high wind or under a blanket or kissing goodnight . You know almost no one does , and you do n't use scent . " She looked at him from the portrait and said nothing . " The hell with it , " he said . " I 'm not going to talk to a picture . " What do you think went wrong tonight ? he thought . Me , I guess . Well I will try to be a good boy tomorrow all day ; starting at first light . " Daughter , " he said , and he was talking to her , and not to a picture now . " Please know I love you and that I wish to be delicate and good . And please stay with me always now . " The picture was the same . The Colonel took out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling them slide , cold and yet warm , as they take warmth , and as all good stones have warmth , from his bad hand into his good hand . I should have put these in an envelope and locked them up , he thought . But what the effing security is there better than I can give them ? I have to get these back to you fast , Daughter . It was fun , though . And they 're not worth more than a quarter of a million . What I would make in four hundred years . Have to check that figure.  |p166He  put the stones in the pocket of his pajamas and put a handkerchief over them . Then he buttoned the pocket . The first sound thing you learn , he thought , is to have flaps and buttons on all your pockets . I imagine that I learned it too early . The stones felt good . They were hard and warm against his flat , hard , old , and warm chest , and he noted how the wind was blowing , looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then started to read the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune . I ought to take the pills , he thought . But the hell with the pills . Then he took them just the same , and went on reading the New York Herald . He was reading Red Smith , and he liked him very much.  |p167THE  Colonel woke before daylight and checked that there was no one sleeping with him . The wind was still blowing hard and he went to the open windows to check the weather . There was no light as yet in the east across the Grand Canal , but his eyes could see how rough the water was . Be a hell of a tide today , he thought . Probably flood the square . That 's always fun . Except for the pigeons . He went to the bathroom , taking the Herald Tribune and Red Smith with him , as well as a glass of Valpolicella . Damn I 'll be glad when the Gran Maestro gets those big fiascos , he thought . This wine gets awfully dreggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , thinking of the things of that day . There would be the telephone call . But it might be very late because she would be sleeping late . The young sleepp168late , he thought , and the beautiful sleep half again as late . She certainly would not call early , and the shops did not open until nine or a little later . Hell , he thought , I have these damned stones . How could anyone do a thing like that ? You know how , he said to himself , reading the ads in the back of the paper . You 've put it on the line enough times . It is n't crazy or morbid . She just wanted to put it on the line . It was a good thing it was me , he thought . That is the only good thing about being me , he considered . Well I 'm me , God-damn it . For better or for much worse . How would you like to sit on the can as you have sat almost every morning of your damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one , except , perhaps , posterity . How many mornings have you sat in the row with all the others ? That 's the worst of it . That and shaving . Or you go off to be alone , and think or not think , and pick a good piece of cover and there are two riflemen there already , or some boy asleep . There 's no more privacy in the army than in a professionalshit-house . I 've never been in a professional shithousebut I imagine they run it much the same . I could learn to run one , he thought . Then I 'd make all my leading shit-house characters Ambassadors and the unsuccessful ones could be CorpsCommandersor command military districts in peace time . Do n't be bitter , boy , he said to himself . It 's too early in the morning and your duty 's not completed yet.  |p169What  would you do with their wives , he asked himself ? Buy them new hats or shoot them , he said . It 's all part of the same process . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half closed door . It showed him at a slight angle . It 's a deflection shot , he said to himself , and they did n't lead me enough . Boy , he said , you certainly are a beat-up , old looking bastard . Now you have to shave and look at that face while you do it . Then you must get a hair-cut . That 's easy in this town . You 're a Colonel of Infantry , boy . You ca n't go around looking like Joan of Arc or General ( Brevetted ) George Armstrong Custer . That beautiful horse-cavalryman . I guess it is fun to be that way and have a loving wife and use sawdust for brains . But it must have seemed- like the wrong career to him when they finished up on that hill above the Little Big Horn , with the ponies making the circle around them in all the dust , and the sage brush crushed by the hooves of the horses of the other people , ana nothing left to him for the rest of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people shooting each other , and themselves , because they were afraid of what the squaws would do to them . The body was unspeakably mutilated , they used to put in this same paper . And on that hill to know you 'd made one real mistake , finally , and for good , and complete with true handles . Poor horse-cavalryman , he thought . The end of all his dreams . That 's one good thing about being an Infantryman . You never have any dreams except bad dreams.  |p170Well  , he said to himself , we 're finished here , and pretty soon there will be good light and I can see the portrait . I 'll be damned if I 'll turn that in . I keep that . Oh Christ , he said , I wonder what she looks like now sleeping . I know how she looks , he said to himself . Wonderful . She sleeps as though she had not gone to sleep . As though she were just resting . I hope she is , he thought . I hope she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I hope I never do her harm.  |p171WHEN  it started to be light , the Colonel saw the portrait . He , very probably , saw it as quickly as any man who was civilized and had to read and sign the forms he did not believe in , could see an object , as soon as it was visible . Yes , he said to himself , I have eyes and they have fairly fast perception still , and once they had ambition . I have led my Ruffians where they were well peppered . There are but three of the two hundred and fifty of them left alive and they are for the town 's end to beg during life . That 's from Shakespeare , he told the portrait . The winner and still the undisputed champion . Someone might take him , in a short bout . But I would rather revere him . Did you ever read King Lear , Daughter ? Mister Gene Tunney did , and he was the champion of the world . But I read it too . Soldiers care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes like a soldier himself.  |p172You  have anything to say in your defense except to put your head back ? he asked the portrait . You want some more , Shakespeare ? You do n't have to defend . You just rest and leave it as it is . It 's no good . Your defense and my defense is no damn good . But who could tell you to go out and hang yourself the way we do ? Nobody , he said to himself , and to the portrait . And certainly not me . He put his good hand down and found that the room waiter had left a second bottle of Valpolicella alongside of where the first had been . If you love a country , the Colonel thought , you might as well admit it . Sure , admit it boy . I have loved three and lost them thrice . Give a credit . We 've re-took two . Retaken , he corrected . And we will retake the other one , General Fat Ass Franco on his shooting stick with the advice of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he shoots . Yes , he said softly to the girl who looked at him clearly now in the first and best light . We will retake and they will all be hung upside down outside of filling stations . You have been warned , he added . " Portrait , " he said , " why the hell ca n't you just get into bed with me instead of being eighteen solid stone blocks away . Maybe more . I 'm not as sharp now as I was ; whenever.  --  " Portrait , " he said to the girl , and to the portrait , andp173to the girl both ; but there was n't any girl , and the portrait was as it was painted . " Portrait , keep your God-damn chin up so you can break my heart easier . " It certainly was a lovely present , the Colonel thought . " Can you maneuver ? " he asked the portrait . " Good and fast ? " Portrait said nothing and the Colonel answered , You know damn well she can . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would stay and fight where you would eff-off , discreetly . " Portrait , " he said . " Boy or daughter or my one true love or whatever it is ; you know what it is , portrait . " The portrait , as before , did not answer . But the Colonel , who was a General now again , early in the morning at the only time he really knew , and with Valpolicella , knew as absolutely as though he had just read his third Wassermann that there was no eff-off in portrait , and he felt shame for having talked to portrait roughly . " I 'll be the best God-damned boy you ever witnessed today . And you can tell your principal that . " Portrait , as was her fashion , was silent . She probably would speak to a horse-cavalryman , the General , for now he had two stars , and they grated on his shoulders , and showed white in the vague , scuffed red on the plaque in front of his jeep . He never used command cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell with you , portrait , " he said . " Or get yourp174T.S. slip from the universal chaplain of us all , with combinedreligions . You ought to be able to eat on that . " " The hell with you , " the portrait said , without speaking . " You low class soldier . " " Yes , " the Colonel said , for now he was a Colonel again , and had relinquished all his former rank . " I love you , portrait , very much . But do n't get rough with me . I love you very much because you are beautiful . But I love the girl better , a million times better , hear it ? " There was no sign that she heard it , so he tired of it . " You are in a fixed position , portrait , " he said . " Without or with any frame . And I am going to maneuver . " The portrait was as silent as she had been since the conciergehad brought her into the room , and aided and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel and to the girl . The Colonel looked at her and saw she was indefensible , now that the light was good , or almost good . He saw , too , that she was the portrait of his own true love , and so he said , " I am sorry for all the stupidnesses I say . I do not wish ever to be brutal . Maybe we could both sleep a little while , with luck , and then , perhaps , your Mistress would call on the telephone ? " Maybe she will even call , he thought.  |p175THE  hall porter pushed the Gazzetino under the door , and the Colonel had it , noiselessly , almost as soon as it had passed through the slit . He very nearly took it from the hall porter 's hand . He did not like the hall porter since he had found him , one day , going through his bag , when he , the Colonel , had re-entered the room after having left it , presumably for some time . He had to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he had forgotten , and the hall porter was well through his bag . " I guess you do n't say stick them up in this hotel , " the Colonel had said . " But you 're no credit to your town . " There was silence produced , and re-produced , by the striped waist-coated man with the Fascist face , and the Colonel said , " Go on , boy , look through the rest of it . I do n't carry any military secrets with my toilet articles . " Since then , there was scant friendship between them ,  |p176and  the Colonel enjoyed trying to take the morning paper from the striped waist-coated man 's hand ; noiselessly , and when he heard , or saw it first make a move under the door . " OK , you won today , jerk , " he said in the best Venetian dialect he could summon at that hour . " Go hang yourself . " But they do n't hang themselves , he thought . They just have to go on putting papers under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must be quite a difficult trade being an ex-Fascist . Maybe he is not an ex-Fascist too . How do you know . I ca n't hate Fascists , he thought . Nor Krauts either , since unfortunately , I am a soldier . " Listen , Portrait , " he said . " Do I have to hate the Krauts because we kill them ? Do I have to hate them as soldiers and as human beings ? It seems too easy a solution to me . " Well , portrait . Forget it . Forget it . You 're not old enough to know about it . You are two years younger than the girl that you portray , and she is younger and older than hell ; which is quite an old place . " Listen , portrait , " he said , and saying it , knew that now as long as he lived , he would have someone to talk to at the early hours that he woke . " As I was saying , portrait . The hell with that too . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things you ca n't say no matter how true it is . There are lots of things I can never say to you and maybe that will be good for me . It is about time something was . What do you think would be good for me , Portrait ?  | " What 's the matter , Portrait ? " he asked her . " You getting hungry ? I am . " So he rang the bell for the waiter who would bring breakfast . He knew that now , even though the light was so good that every wave showed on the Grand Canal , lead colored and solid heavy with the wind , and the tide now high over the landing steps of the Palace directly opposite his room , there would be no telephone call for several hours . The young sleep good , he thought . They deserve it . " Why do we have to get old ? " he asked the waiter who had come in with his glass-eye and the menu . " I do n't know , my Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . I guess I imagine that too . The eggs fried with their faces up . Tea and toast . " " You do n't want anything American ? " " The hell with anything American except me . Is the Gran Maestro astir yet ? " " He has your Valpolicella in the big wicker fiascos of two liters and I have brought this decanter with it . " " That one , " the Colonel said . " I wish to Christ I could give him a regiment . " " I do n't think he would want one , really . " " No , " the Colonel said . " I do n't want one , really , myself . "  |p178THE  Colonel breakfasted with the leisure of a fighter who has been clipped badly , hears four , and knows how to relax truly for five seconds more . " Portrait , " he said . " You ought to relax too . That 's the only thing that is going to be difficult about you . That 's what they call the static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost no pictures , paintings rather , move at all . A few do . But not many . " I wish that your mistress was here and we could have movement . How do girls like you and she know so much so damn young and be so beautiful ? " With us , if a girl is really beautiful , she comes from Texas and maybe , with luck , she can tell you what month it is . They can all count good though . " They teach them how to count , and keep their legs together , and how to put their hair up in pin curls . Some/time , portrait , for your sins , if you have any , you ought to have to sleep in a bed with a girl who has put her hair up in pin curls to be beautiful tomorrow . Not tonight . They 'd never be beautiful tonight . For tomorrow , when we make the competition . " The girl , Renata , that you are , is sleeping now without ever having done anything to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillow and all it is to her is a glorious , dark , silky annoyance , that she can hardly remember to comb , except that her governess taught her . " I see her in the street with the lovely long-legged stride and the wind doing anything it wants to her hair , and her true breasts under the sweater , and then I see the nights in Texas with the pin curls ; tight and subjected by metallic instruments . " Pin me no pin curls , my beloved , " he said to the Portrait , " and I will try to lay it on the line in round , heavy , hard silver dollars or with the other . " I must n't get rough , he thought . Then he said to the portrait , for he did not capitalize her now in his mind , " You are so God-damned beautiful you stink . Also you are jail-bait . Renata 's two years older now . You are under seventeen . " And why ca n't I have her and love her and cherish her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five sons that go to the five corners of the world ; wherever that is ? I do n't know . I guess the cards we draw are those we get . You would n't like to re-deal would you dealer ? No . They only deal to you once , and then you pick themp180up and play them . I can play them , if I draw any damn thing at all , he told portrait ; who was unimpressed . " Portrait , " he said . " You better look the other way so that you will not be unmaidenly . I am going to take a shower now and shave , something you will never have to do , and put on my soldier-suit and go and walk around this town even though it is too early . " So , he got out of bed , favoring his bad leg , which hurt him always . He pulled the reading light with his bad hand . There was sufficient light , and he had been wasting electricityfor nearly an hour . He regretted this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only looking casually , and looked at himself in the mirror . He had dropped both parts of his pajamas and he looked at himself critically and truly . " You beat-up old bastard , " he said to the mirror . Portraitwas a thing of the past . Mirror was actuality and of this day . The gut is flat , he said without uttering it . The chest is all right except where it contains the defective muscle . We are hung as we are hung , for better or worse , or something , or something awful . You are one half a hundred years old , you bastard you . Now go in and take a shower , and scrub good , and afterwardsput on your soldier suit . Today is another day.  |p181THE  Colonel stopped at the reception desk in the lobby , but the concierge was not there yet . There was only the night porter . " Can you put something in the safe for me ? " " No , my Colonel . No one may open the safe until the assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything for you that you wish . " " Thank you . It 's not worth the trouble , " and he buttonedthe Gritti envelope , with the stones inside , the envelopeaddressed to himself , into the inside left pocket of his tunic . " There 's no real crime here now , " the night porter said . It had been a long night and he was happy to speak to someone . " There never really was , my Colonel . There are only differences of opinion and politics . " " What do you have for politics ? " the Colonel asked ; for he was lonely too.  | " About what you would expect . " " I see . And how is your thing going ? " " I think it goes quite well . Maybe not as well as last year . But still quite well . We were beaten and we have to wait a while now . " " Do you work at it ? " " Not much . It is more the politics of my heart than of my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I have very little political development . " " When you get it you wo n't have any heart . " " Maybe not . Do you have politics in the army ? " " Plenty , " the Colonel said . " But not what you mean . " " Well , we better not discuss it then . I have not meantto be intrusive . " " I asked the question ; the original question rather . It was only to talk . It was not an interrogation . " " I do n't think it was . You do not have the face of an inquisitor , my Colonel , and I know about the Order , although I am not a member . " " You may be member material . I 'll take it up with the Gran Maestro . " " We come from the same town ; but from distinct quarters . " " It 's a good town . " " My Colonel , I have so little political development that I believe all honorable men are honorable . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Do n't worry , boy . You 've got a young party . Naturally you make errors . "  | " Please do n't talk like that . " " It was just rough early morning joking . " " Tell me , my Colonel , what do you really think about Tito ? " " I think several things . But he 's my next door neighbor . I 've found it better not to talk about my neighbor . " " I 'd like to learn . " " Then learn it the hard way . Do n't you know people do n't give answers to such questions ? " " I had hoped they did . " " They do n't , " the Colonel said . " Not in my position . All I can tell you is that Mister Tito has plenty problems . " " Well , I know that now truly , " the night porter whowas really only a boy said . " I hope you do , " the Colonel said . " I would n't call it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good-day , for I must take a walk for the good of my liver , or something . " " Good day , my Colonel . Fa brutto tempo . " " Bruttissimo , " the Colonel said and , pulling the belt of his raincoat tight , and settling his shoulders into it , and the skirts well down , he stepped out into the wind.  |p184THE  Colonel took the ten centesimi gondola across the Canal , paying the usual dirty note , and standing with the crowd of those condemned to early rising . He looked back at the Gritti and saw the windows of his room ; still open . There was no promise nor threat of rain ; only the same strong wild , cold wind from the mountains . Everyone in the gondola looked cold and the Colonel thought , I wish I could issue these wind-proof coats to everyone on board . God , and every officer that ever wore one , knows they are not water-proof , and who made the money out of that one ? You ca n't get water through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boy in Groton now , or maybe Canterbury , where the big contractors ' boys go , because our coats leaked . And what about some brother officer of mine who split with him ? I wonder who the Benny Meyers of the groundp185forces were ? There probably was n't only one . Probably , he thought , there must be very many . You must not be awake yet , to talk that simply . They do keep the wind out though . The raincoats . Raincoats my ass . The gondola pulled up between the stakes on the far bank of the canal and the Colonel watched the black-clad people climb up out of the black-painted vehicle . Is she a vehicle ? he thought . Or must a vehicle have wheels or be tracked ? Nobody would give you a penny for your thoughts , he thought . Not this morning . But I 've seen them worth a certain amount of money when the chips were down . He penetrated into the far side of the city , the side that finally fronted on the Adriatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in by a very narrow street , and he was going to not keep track of the number of more or less north and south streets that he crossed , nor count the bridges , and then try and orient himself so he would come out at the market without getting up any dead ends . It was a game you play , as some people used to play double Canfield or any solitary card games . But it had the advantage of you moving while you do it and that you look at the houses , the minor vistas , the shops and the trattorias and at old palaces of the city of Venice while you are walking . If you loved the city of Venice it was an excellent game . It is a sort of solitaire ambulante and what you win is the happiness of your eye and heart . If you made the market , on this side of town , without ever being stymied , you wonp186the game . But you must not make it too easy and you must not count . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Gritti and make the Rialto by the Fondamente Nuove without a mistake . Then you could climb the bridge and cross it and go down into the market . He liked the market best . It was the part of any town he always went to first . Just then he heard the two young men behind him sayingthe things about him . He knew they were young men by their voices and he did not look back , but listened carefully for distance and waited for the next turn to see them , as he turned . They are on their way to work , he decided . Maybe they are former Fascists or maybe they are something else , or maybe it is just the line that they are talking . But they are making it pretty personal now . It is n't just Americans , it is also me , myself , my gray hair , the slightly crooked way I walk , the combat boots ( those , of that stripe , disliked the practicability of combat boots . They liked boots that rang on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It is my uniform which they find to be without grace . Now it is why I am walking at this hour , and now it is their absolute security that I can no longer make love . The Colonel swung sharp to the left at the next corner , seeing what he had to deal with and the exact distance , and when the two young men came around the corner which was formed by the apse of the church of Frari there was no Colonel . He was in the dead angle behind the apse ofp187the ancient church and as they passed , he , hearing mein come by their talk , stepped out with a hand in each low pocket of his raincoat and turned himself , and the raincoat , with the two hands in the pockets , toward them . They stopped and he looked at them both in the face and smiled his old and worn death smile . Then he looked down at their feet , as you always look at the feet of such people , since they wear their shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them you see their hammer-toes . The Colonel spat on the pavement and said nothing . The two of them , they were the first thing he had suspected , looked at him with hatred and with that other thing . Then they were off like marsh-birds , walking with the long strides of herons too , the Colonel thought , and something of the flight of curlews , and looking back with hatred , waiting to have the last word if the distance was ever safe . It is a pity they were n't ten against one , the Colonel thought . They might have fought . I should not blame them , since they were defeated . But their manners were not good in respect to a man of my rank and age . Also it was not intelligent to think all fifty year old Colonels would not understand their language . Nor was it intelligent to think old Infantrymen would not fight this early in the morning against the simple odds of two to one . I 'd hate to fight in this town where I love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those badly educated youthsrealize what sort of animal they were dealing with ? Don'tp188they know how you get to walk that way ? Nor any of the other signs that combat people show as surely as a fisherman'shands tell you if he is a fisherman from the creases from the cord cuts . It is true they only saw my back and ass and legs and boots . But you 'd think they might have told from the way they must move . Maybe they do n't anymore . But when I had a chance to look at them and think , Take the two of them out and hang them , I believe they understood . They understood quite clearly . What 's a man life worth anyway ? Ten thousand dollars if his insurance is paid up in our army . What the hell has that got to do with it . Oh yes , that was what I was thinking about before those jerks showed ; how much money I had saved my government , in my time when people like Benny Meyers were in the trough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at the Chateau that time at ten G 's a head . Well nobody ever really understoodit except me , I guess . There 's no reason to tell them now . Your commanding general sometimes puts things down as the Fortunes of War . Back at Army they know such things are bound to happen . You do it , as ordered , with a big butcher-bill and you 're a hero . Christ , I am opposed to the excessive butcher-bill , he thought . But you get the orders , and you have to carry them out . It is the mistakes that are no good to sleep with . But why the hell sleep with them anyway . It never did any good . But they can certainly crawl into a sack sometimes . They can crawl in and stay in there with you.  |p189Cheer  up , boy , he said . Remember you had a lot of money on you when you picked that one . And you might have been stripped if you lost . You ca n't fight a lick anymore with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So do n't be gloomy , boy , or man , or Colonel , or busted General . We 're almost to the market now and you made it without hardly noticing . Hardly noticing is bad , he added.  |p190HE  loved the market . A great part of it was close-packed and crowded into several side streets , and it was so concentrated that it was difficult not to jostle people , unintentionally , and each time you stopped to look , to buy , or to admire , you formed an ilot de resistance against the flow of the morning attack of the purchasers . The Colonel liked to study the spread and high piled cheeses and the great sausages . People at home think mortadella is a sausage , he thought . Then he said to the woman in the booth , " Let me try a little of that sausage , please . Only a sliver . " She cut a thin , paper thin , slice for him , ferociously , and lovingly , and when the Colonel tasted it , there was the half smokey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hogs that ate acorns in the mountains . " I will take a quarter of a kilo . " The Barone 's lunches for the shooting blinds were of ap191Spartan quality , which the Colonel respected , since he knew no one should eat much while shooting . He felt , though , that he might augment the lunch with this sausage , and share it with the poler and picker-upper . He might give a slice to Bobby , the retriever , who would be wet through to his hide many times , and enthusiastic still , but shaking with cold . " Is this the best sausage that you have ? " he asked the woman . " Have you nothing that does not show and is reserved for better and steadier customers ? " " This is the best sausage . There are many other sausages , as you know . But this is the best . " " Then give me one eighth of a kilo of a sausage that is highly fortifying , but is not highly seasoned . " " I have it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but exactly as you describe . " This sausage was for Bobby . But you do not say that you buy sausages for a dog in Italy where the worst crime is to be considered a fool and many people go hungry . You may give expensive sausage to a dog before a man who works for his living and knows what a dog goes through in water in cold weather . But you do not buy them , stating your purpose in possessing them , unless you are a fool , or a millionaire from the war and from after . The Colonel paid for the wrapped-up package and proceededon through the market inhaling the smell of roasted coffee and looking at the amount of fat on each carcass in the butcher section , as though he were enjoying the Dutchp192painters , whose names no one remembers , who painted , in perfection of detail , all things you shot , or that were eatable . A market is the closest thing to a good museum like the Prado or as the Accademia is now , the Colonel thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish-market . In the market , spread on the slippery stone floor , or in their baskets , or their rope-handled boxes , were the heavy , gray-green lobsters with their magenta overtones that presagedtheir death in boiling water . They have all been captured by treachery , the Colonel thought , and their claws are pegged . There were the small soles , and there were a few albacore and bonito . These last , the Colonel thought , looked like boat-tailed bullets , dignified in death , and with the huge eye of the pelagic fish . They were not made to be caught except for their voraciousness . The poor sole exists , in shallow water , to feed man . But these other roving bullets , in their great bands , live in blue water and travel through all oceans and all seas . A nickel for your thoughts now , he thought . Let 's see what else they have . There were many eels , alive and no longer confident in their eeldom . There were fine prawns that could make a scampi brochetto spitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Brooklyn icepick . There were medium sized shrimp , gray and opalescent , awaiting their turn , too , for the boiling water and their immortality , top193have their shucked carcasses float out easily on an ebb tide on the Grand Canal . The speedy shrimp , the Colonel thought , with tentacles longer than the mustaches of that old Japanese admiral , comes here now to die for our benefit . Oh Christian shrimp , he thought , master of retreat , and with your wonderful intelligence service in those two light whips , why did they not teach you about nets and that lights are dangerous ? Must have been some slip-up , he thought . Now he looked at the many small crustaceans , the razoredgeclams you only should eat raw if you had your typhoid shots up to date , and all the small delectables . He went past these , stopping to ask one seller where his clams came from . They came from a good place , withoutsewerage and the Colonel asked to have six opened . He drank the juice and cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved knife the man handed him . The man had handed him the knife because he knew from experience the Colonel cut closer to the shell than he had been taught to cut . The Colonel paid him the pittance that they cost , which must have been much greater than the pittance those receivedwho caught them , and he thought , now I must see the stream and canal fishes and get back to the hotel.  |p194THE  Colonel arrived at the lobby of the Hotel GrittiPalace . His gondolieres were paid off and , now , inside the hotel , there was no wind . It had taken two men to bring the gondola up the Grand Canal from the market . They had both worked hard , and he had paid them what it was worth , and some more . " Are there any calls for me ? " he asked the concierge , who was now in attendance . The concierge was light , fast , sharp-faced , intelligent and polite , always , without subservience . He wore the crossed keys of his office on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concierge . It is a rank very close to that of Captain , the Colonel thought . An officer and not a Gentleman . Make it top sergeant in the old days ; except he 's dealing always with the brass . " My lady has called twice , " the concierge said in English . Or whatever that language should be called we allp195speak , the Colonel thought . Leave it at English . That is about what they have left . They should be allowed to keep the name of the language . Cripps will probably ration it shortly anyway . " Please put me through to her at once , " he told the concierge . The concierge commenced to dial numbers . " You may talk over there , my Colonel , " he said . " I have made the connection . " " You 're fast . " " Over there , " the concierge said . Inside the booth the Colonel lifted the receiver and said , automatically , " Colonel Cantwell speaking . " " I called twice , Richard , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were out . Where were you ? " " At the market . How are you , my lovely ? " " No one listens on this phone at this hour . I am your lovely . Whoever that is . " " You . Did you sleep well ? " " It was like ski-ing in the dark . Not really ski-ing but really dark . " " That 's the way it should be . Why did you wake so early ? You 've frightened my concierge . " " If it is not un-maidenly , how soon can we meet , and where ? " " Where you wish and when you wish . " " Do you still have the stones and did Miss Portrait help any ? " " Yes to both questions . The stones are in my upper leftp196hand pocket buttoned down . Miss Portrait and I talked late and early and it made everything much easier . " " Do you love her more than me ? " " I 'm not abnormal yet . Perhaps that 's bragging . But she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Should we have breakfast at the Florian , on the right hand side of the square ? The square should be flooded and it will be fun to watch . " " I 'll be there in twenty minutes if you want me . " " I want you , " the Colonel said and hung up . Coming out of the telephone booth he , suddenly , did not feel good and then he felt as though the devil had him in an iron cage , built like an iron lung or an iron maiden , and he walked , gray-faced , to the concierge 's desk and said , in Italian , " Domenico , Ico , could you get me a glass of water , please ? " The concierge was gone and he leaned on the desk resting . He rested lightly and without illusion . Then the concierge was back with the glass of water , and he took four tablets of the type that you take two , and he continued resting as lightly as a hawk rests . " Domenico , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in an envelope that you can put in the safe . It may be called for either by myself , in person , or in writing , or by the person you have just put that can through to . Would you like that in writing ? " " No . It would be unnecessary . "  | " But what about you , boy ? You 're not immortal , are you ? " " Fairly so , " the concierge told him . " But I will put it in writing , and after me , comes the Manager and the Assistant Manager . " " Both good men , " the Colonel agreed . " Would n't you like to sit down , my Colonel ? " " No . Who sits down except men and women in change of life hotels ? Do you sit down ? " " No . " " I can rest on my feet , or against a God damned tree . My countrymen sit down , or lie down , or fall down . Give them a few energy crackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to regain confidence quickly . " Do they really have energy crackers ? " " Sure . It has something in it that keeps you from get-. ting erections . It 's like the atomic bomb , only played backwards . " " I ca n't believe it . " " We have the most terrific military secrets that one General 's wife ever told another . Energy crackers is the least of it . Next time we will give all Venice botulism from 56,000 feet . There 's nothing to it , " the Colonel explained . " They give you anthrax , and you give them botulism . " " But it will be horrible . " " It will be worse than that , " the Colonel assured him . " This is n't classified . It 's all been published . And while it goes on you can hear Margaret , if you tune in right , singing the Star Spangled Banner on the radio . I think that couldp198be arranged . The voice I would not describe as a big one . Not as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . But everything is a trick now . The radio can almost make the voice . And the Star Spangled Banner is fool-proof until toward the last . " " Do you think they will drop anything here ? " " No . They never have . " The Colonel , who was four star general now , in his wrath and in his agony and in his need for confidence , but secured temporarily through the absorption of the tablets , said , " Ciao , Domenico , " and left the Gritti . He figured it took twelve and one half minutes to reach the place where his true love would probably arrive a little late . He walked it carefully and at the speed he should walk it . The bridges were all the same.  |p199HIS  true love was at the table at the exact time that she said she would be . She was as beautiful as always in the hard , morning light that came across the flooded square , and she said . Please , Richard . Are you all right ? Please ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wonder beauty . " " Did you go to all our places in the market ? " " Only a few of them . I did not go to where they have the wild ducks . " " Thank you . " " For nothing , " the Colonel said . " I never go there when we are not together . " " Do n't you think I should go to the shoot ? " " No . I am quite sure . Alvarito would have asked you if he wanted you . " " He might not have asked me because he wanted me . " " That 's true , " the Colonel said , and pondered that for two seconds . " What do you want for breakfast ? "  | " Breakfast is worthless here , and I do n't like the square when it is flooded . It is sad and the pigeons have no place to alight . It is only really fun toward the last when the children play . Should we go and have breakfast at the Gritti ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good . We 'll have breakfast there . I 've had mine already . " " Really ? " " I 'll have some coffee and hot rolls , and only feel them with my fingers . Are you awfully hungry ? " " Awfully , " she said , truly . " We 'll give breakfast the full treatment , " the Colonel said . " You 'll wish you had never heard of breakfast . " As they walked , with the wind at their back , and her hair blowing better than any banner , she asked him , holding close , " Do you still , love me in the cold , hard Venice light of morning ? It is really cold and hard is n't it ? " " I love you and it is cold and hard . " " I loved you all night when I was ski-ing in the dark . " " How do you do that ? " " It is the same runs except that it is dark and the snow is dark instead of light . You ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ski all night ? That would be many runs . " " No . Afterwards I slept soundly and well and I wokehappy . You were with me and you were asleep like a baby . " " I was n't with you and I was not asleep . "  | " You 're with me now , " she said and held close and tight . " And we are almost there . " " Yes . " " Have I told you , yet , properly , that I love you ? " " You told me . But tell me again . " " I love you , " he said . " Take it frontally and formally please . " " I take it anyway you want as long as it is true . " " That 's the proper attitude , " he said . " You good , brave , lovely girl . Turn your hair sideways once on top of thisbridge and let it blow obliquely . " He had made a concession , with obliquely , instead of saying , correctly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you like it ? " He looked and saw the profile and the wonder early morning colour and her chest upstanding in the black sweater and her eyes in the wind and he said , " Yes . I like it . " " I 'm very glad , " she said.  |p202AT  the Gritti , the Gran Maestro seated them at the table which was beside the window that looked out on the Grand Canal . There was no one else in the dining room . The Gran Maestro was festive and well with the morning . He took his ulcers day by day , and his heart the same way . When they did not hurt he did not hurt either . " Your pitted compatriot eats in bed at his hotel , my colleague tells me , " he confided to the Colonel . " We may have a few Belgians . The bravest of these were the Belgians , ' " he quoted . " There is a pair of pescecani from you know where . But they are exhausted and I believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " An excellent situation report , " the Colonel said . " Our problem , Gran Maestro , is that I have already eaten in my room as pitted does and as the pescecani will . But this lady  --  " " Young girl , " interrupted the Gran Maestro with hisp203whole-face smile . He was feeling very good since it was a completely new day . " This very young lady wants a breakfast to end break-fasts . " " I understand , " the Gran Maestro said and he looked at Renata and his heart rolled over as a porpoise does in the sea . It is a beautiful movement and only a few people in this world can feel it and accomplish it . " What do you want to eat , Daughter ? " the Colonel asked , looking at her early morning , unretouched dark beauty . " Everything . " " Would you give any suggestions ? " " Tea instead of coffee and whatever the Gran Maestro can salvage . " " It wo n't be salvage , Daughter , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Daughter . " " I said it honestly , " the Gran Maestro said . " We can make or fabricar rognons grilled with champignons dug by people I know . Or , raised in damp cellars . There can be an omelet with truffles dug by pigs of distinction . There can be real Canadian bacon from maybe Canada , even . " " Wherever that is , " the girl said happily and unillusioned . " Wherever that is , " said the Colonel seriously . " And I know damn well where it is . " " I think we should stop the jokes now and get to the breakfast . " " If it is not unmaidenly I think so too . Mine is a decantedflask of the Valpolicella. "  | " Nothing else ? " " Bring me one ration of the alleged Canadian bacon , " the Colonel said . He looked at the girl , since they were alone now , and he said , " How are you my dearest ? " " Quite hungry , I suppose . But thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was easy , " the Colonel told her in Italian.  |p205THEY  sat there at the table and watched the early stormy light over the Canal . The grey had turned to a yellow grey , now , with the sun , and the waves were workingagainst the outgoing tide . " Mummy says she ca n't live here too long at any time because there are no trees , " the girl said . " That 's why she goes to the country . " " That 's why everyone goes to the country , " the Colonel said . " We could plant a few trees if we found a place with a big enough garden . " " I like Lombardy poplars and plane trees the best , but I am still quite uneducated . " " I like them , and cypresses and chestnut trees . The real chestnut and the horse-chestnut . But you will never see trees , Daughter , until we go to America . Wait till you see a white pine or a ponderosa pine . " " Will we see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling stations or comfort stations or whatever they are called ? " " Lodges and Tourist Camps , " the Colonel said . " Those others we stop at ; but not for the night . " " I want so much for us to roll up to a comfort station and plank down my money and tell them to fill her up and check the oil , Mac , the way it is in American books or in the films . " " That 's a filling station . " " Then what is a comfort station ? " " Where you go , you know " Oh , " the girl said and blushed . " I 'm sorry . I want to learn American so much . But I suppose I shall say barbarousthings the way you do sometimes in Italian . " " It is an easy language . The further West you go the straighter and the easier it becomes . " The Gran Maestro brought the breakfast and the odor of it , although it did not spread through the room , due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as broiled bacon and kidneys , with the dark lusterless smell of grilled mushrooms added . " It looks lovely , " the girl said . " Thank you very much , Gran Maestro . Should I talk American ? " she asked the Colonel . She extended her hand to the Gran Maestro lightly , and fastly , so that it darted as a rapier does , and said , " Put it there , Pal . This grub is tops . " The Gran Maestro said , " Thank you , my lady . " " Should I have said chow instead of grub ? " the girl asked the Colonel . " They are really interchangeable . "  | " Did they talk like that out West when you were a boy ? What would you say at breakfast ? " " Breakfast was served , or offered up , by the cook . He would say , Come and get it , you sons of bitches , or I 'll throw it away . ' " " I must learn that for in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife for dinner I will teach the footman , who will announce dinner , to say , Come and get it , you son of bitches , or we will throw it away . ' " " He 'd devaluate , " the Colonel said . " At any rate , it would be an interesting experiment . " " Tell me something I can say in true American to the pitted one if he comes in . I will just whisper it in his ear as though I were making a rendezvous , as they did in the old days . " " It would depend on how he looks . If he is very dejected looking , you might whisper to him , Listen , Mac . You hired out to be tough , did n't you ? ' " " That 's lovely , " she said and repeated it in a voice she had learned from Ida Lupino . " Can I say it to the Gran Maestro ? " " Sure . Why not . Gran Maestro ! " The . Gran Maestro came over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired out to be tough , did n't you ? " the girl hard-worded him . " I did indeed , " the Gran Maestro said . " Thank you for stating it so exactly . " " If that one comes in and you wish to speak to himp208after he has eaten , just whisper in his ear , Wipe the egg off your chin , Jack , and straighten up and fly right . ' " " I 'll remember it and I 'll practice it at home . " " What are we going to do after breakfast ? " " Should we go up and look at the picture and see if it is of any value , I mean any good , in daylight ? " " Yes , " the Colonel said.  |p209UPSTAIRS  the room was already done and the Colonel , who had anticipated a possible messiness of locale , was pleased . " Stand by it once , " he said . Then remembered to add , " Please . " She stood by it , and he looked at it from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no comparison , of course , " he said . " I do n't mean likeness . The likeness is excellent . " " Was there supposed to be a comparison ? " the girl asked , and swung her head back and stood there with the black sweater of the portrait . " Of course not . But last night , and at first light , I talked to the portrait as though it were you . " " That was nice of you and shows it has served some useful purpose . "  |p210They  were lying now on the bed and the girl said to him , " Do n't you ever close windows ? " " No . Do you ? " " Only when it rains . " " How much alike are we ? " " I do n't know . We never had much of a chance to find out . " We 've never had a fair chance . But we 've had enough of a chance for me to know . " " And when you know what the hell have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Something better than there is , I suppose . " " Sure . We ought to try for that . I do n't believe in limited objectives . Sometimes you 're forced to , though . " " What is your great sorrow ? " " Other people 's orders , " he said . " What 's yours ? " " You . " " I do n't want to be a sorrow . I 've been a sorry son of a bitch many times . But I never was anybody 's sorrow . " " Well you are mine now . " " All right , " he said . " We 'll take it that way . " " You 're nice to take it that way . You 're very kind this morning . I 'm so ashamed about how things are . Please hold me very close and let 's not talk , or think , about how things might have been different . " " Daughter , that 's one of the few things I know how to do . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say such a thing . " " Sure , " the Colonel said . " I know how to fight forwards and how to fight backwards and what else ? " " About pictures and about books and about life . " " That 's easy . You just look at the pictures without prejudice , and you read the books with as open a mind as you have , and you live life . " " Do n't take off your tunic , please . " " All right . " " You do anything when I say please . " " I have done things without . " " Not very often . " " No , " the Colonel agreed . " Please is a pretty- word . " " Please , please , please . " " Per piacere . It means for pleasure . I wish we always talked Italian . " " We could in the dark . Although there are things that say better in English . " I love you my last true and only love , " she quoted . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cradle endlessly rocking . And come and get it , you sons of bitches , or I 'll throw it away . You do n't want those in other languages do you , Richard ? " " No . " " Kiss me again , please . " " Unnecessary please . " " I would probably end up as an unnecessary please myself . That is the good thing about you going to die that you ca n't leave me. "  | " That 's a little rough , " the Colonel said . " Watch your beautiful mouth a little on that . " " I get rough when you get rough , " she said . " You would n't want me to be completely otherwise ? " " I would not want you to be in any way other than you are and I love you truly , finally and for good . " " You say nice things very clearly sometimes . What was it happened with you and your wife , if I may ask ? " " She was an ambitious woman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went away , from ambition , when you only were away from duty ? " " Sure , " the Colonel said and remembered , as unbitterly as he could . " She had more ambition than Napoleon and about the talent of the average High School Valedic-torian . " " Whatever that is , " the girl said . " But let 's not speak about her . I 'm sorry I asked the question . She must be sad that she is not with you . " " No . She is too conceited ever to be sad , and she married me to advance herself in Army circles , and have better contacts for what she considered her profession , or her art . She was a journalist . " " But they are dreadful , " the girl said . " I agree . " " But you could n't have married a woman journalist that kept on being that ? " " I told you I made mistakes , " the Colonel said . " Let 's talk about something nice . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could you have done such a thing ? " " I do n't know . I could tell you in detail but let 's skip it . " " Please let 's skip it . But I had no idea it was something as awful as that . You would n't do such a thing now , would you ? " " I promise you , my sweet . " " But you do n't ever write to her ? " " Of course not . " " You would n't tell her about us , so she could write about it ? " " No . I told her about things once , and she wrote about them . But that was in another country and besides the wench is dead . " " Is she really dead ? " " Deader than Phoebus the Phoenician . But she does n't know it : yet . " " What would you do if we were together in the Piazza and you saw her ? " " I 'd look straight through her to show her how dead she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl said . " You know that another woman , or a woman in memory , is a terrible thing for a young girl to deal with when she is still withoutexperience . " " There is n't any other woman , " the Colonel told her , and his eyes were bad and remembering . " Nor is there any woman of memory . "  | " Thank you very much , " the girl said . " When I look at you I believe it truly . But please never look at me nor think of me like that . " " Should we hunt her down and hang her to a high tree ? " the Colonel said with anticipation . " No . Let us forget her . " " She is forgotten , " the Colonel said . And , strangely enough , she was . It was strange because she had been present in the room for a moment , and she had very nearly caused a panic ; which is one of the strangest things there is , the Colonel thought . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and forever ; cauterized ; exorcised and with the eleven copies of her reclassification papers , in which was included the formal , notarized act of divorcement , in triplicate . " She is forgotten , " the Colonel said . It was quite true . " I 'm so pleased , " the girl said . " I do n't know why they ever let her into the hotel . " " We 're enough alike , " the Colonel said . " We better not carry it too God damned far . " " You can hang her if you wish because she is why we can not marry . " " She 's forgotten , " the Colonel told her . " Maybe she will take a good look at herself in the mirror sometime and hang herself . " " Now that she is out of the room we should wish her no bad luck . But , as a good Venetian , I wish that she were dead . "  | " So do I , " the Colonel said . " And now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps . " " For keeps and for always , " the girl said . " I hope that is the correct diction . Or in Spanish para sempre . " " Para sempre and his brother , " the Colonel said.  |p226THEY  lay together now and did not speak and theColonel felt her heart beat . It is easy to feel a heart beat under a black sweater knitted by someone in the family , and her dark hair lay , long and heavy , over his good arm . It is n't heavy , he thought , it is lighter than anything there is . She lay , quiet and loving , and whatever it was that they possessed was in complete communication . He kissed her on the mouth , gently and hungrily , and then it was as though there was static , suddenly , when communications had been perfect . " Richard , " she said . " I 'm sorry about things . " " Never be sorry , " the Colonel said . " Never discuss casualties , Daughter . " " Say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me some happy things I can have for during the week and some more of war for my education ? "  | " Let 's skip war . " " No . I need it for my education . " " I do too , " the Colonel said . " Not maneuvers . You know , in our army once , a general officer through chicaneryobtained the plan of the maneuver . He anticipated every move of the enemy force and comported himself so brilliantly that he was promoted over many better men . And that was why we got smacked one time . That and the prevalence of week-ends . " " We 're on a week-end now . " " I know , " the Colonel said . " I can still count up to seven . " " But are you bitter about everything ? " " No . It is just that I am half a hundred years old and I know things . " " Tell me something more about Paris because I love to think of you and Paris in the week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris ? " " But I 've been in Paris , and I will go back there again , and I want to know . It is the loveliest city in the world , next to our own , and I want to know some things truly to take with me . " " We will go together and I will tell you there . " " Thank you . But tell me a little now for this week only . " " Leclerc was a high-born jerk as I think that I 've explained . Very brave , very arrogant , and extremely ambitious . He is dead , as I said . " " Yes , you told me . " " They say you should never speak ill of the dead . But Ip218think it is the best time to speak truly of them . I have never said anything of a dead that I would not say to his face , " and he added , " in spades . " " Let 's not talk about him . I have reclassified him in my mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes please . I have bad taste from reading the illustrated papers . But I will read Dante all week while you are gone . I 'll go to mass each morning . That should be enough . " " Go to Harry 's before lunch too . " " I will , " she said . " Please tell me some picturesque . " " Do n't you think we might better just go to sleep ? " " How can we go to sleep now when we have so little time ? Feel this , " she said and pushed her whole head up under his chin until she forced his head back . " All right , I 'll talk . " " Give me your hand first to hold . I 'll have it in my hand when I read the Dante and do the other things . " " Dante was an execrable character . More conceited than Leclerc . " " I know . But he did not write execrably . " " No . Leclerc could fight too . Excellently . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest now , and the Colonel said , " Why did you not want me to take off the tunic ? " " I like to feel the buttons . Is it wrong ? " " I 'll be a sad son of a bitch , " the Colonel said . " How many people fought in your family ? "  | " Everybody , " she said . " Always . They were traders as well and several of them were Doges of this city as you know . " " But they all fought ? " " All , " she said . " As far as I know . " " OK , " the Colonel said . " I 'll tell you any God damn thing you want to know . " " Just something picturesque . As bad or worse than in the illustrated papers . " " Domenica Del Corriere or Tribuna Illustrata ? " " Worse if possible . " " Kiss me first . " She kissed him kind , and hard , and desperately , and the Colonel could not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He only thought of her and how she felt and how close life comes to death when there is ecstasy . And what the hell is ecstasy and what 's ecstasy 's rank and serial number ? And how does her black sweater feel . And who made all her smoothness and delight and the strange pride and sacrifice and wisdom of a child ? Yes , ecstasy is what you might have had and instead you draw sleep 's other brother . Death is a lot of shit , he thought . It comes to you in small fragments that hardly show where it has entered . It comes , sometimes , atrociously . It can come from unboiled water ; an un-pulled-up mosquito boot , or it can come with the great , white-hot , clanging roar we have lived with . It comes in small cracking whispers that precede the noise of the automatic weapon . It can come with the smoke-emit/ting arc of the grenade , or the sharp , cracking drop of the mortar . I have seen it come , loosening itself from the bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in the metallic rending crash of a vehicle , or the simple lack of traction on a slippery road . It comes in bed to most people , I know , like love 's oppositenumber . I have lived with it nearly all my life and the dispensing of it has been my trade . But what can I tell this girl now on this cold , windy morning in the Gritti Palace Hotel ? " What would you like to know , Daughter ? " he asked her . " Everything . " " All right , " the Colonel said . " Here goes . "  |p221THEY  lay on the pleasantly hard , new-made bed with their legs pressed tight against one another , and her head was on his chest , and her hair spread across his old hard neck ; and he told her . " We landed without much opposition . They had the true opposition at the other beach . Then we had to link up with the people who had been dropped , and take and secure various towns , and then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done very fast , and the orders were from a General called Lightning Joe that you never would have heard of . Good General . " " Go on , please . You spoke about Lightning Joe be-fore . " " After Cherbourg we had everything . I took nothing but an Admiral 's compass because I had a small boat at that time on Chesapeake Bay . But we had all the Wehrmacht stamped Martell and some people had as much as six millionp222German printed French francs . They were good until a year ago , and at that time they were worth fifty to the dollar , and many a man has a tractor now instead of simply one mule who knew how to send them home through his Esses , or sometimes his G 's . " I never stole anything except the compass because I though it was bad luck to steal , unnecessarily , in war . But I drank the cognac and I used to try to figure out the differentcorrections on the compass when I had time . The compass was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had more wire strung than there are cunts in Texas . " " Please keep telling me and be as little rough as you can . I do n't know what the word means and I do n't want to know . " " Texas is a big state , " the Colonel said . " That is why I used it and its female population as a symbol . You can not say more cunts than Wyoming because there are less than thirty thousand there , perhaps , hell , make it fifty , and there was a lot of wire , and you kept stringing it and rolling it up , and stringing it again . " " Go on . " " We will cut to the break-through , " the Colonel said . " Please tell me if this bores you . " " No . " " So we made the mucking break-through , " the Colonel said , and now his head was turned to her head , and he was not lecturing ; he was confessing . " The first day most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuse the other people 's radar and it was called off . We were ready to go but they called it off . Quite properly I am sure . I love the very highest brass like I love the pig 's you know . " " Tell it to me and do n't be bad . " " Conditions were not propitious , " the Colonel said . " So the second day we were for it , as our British cousins , who could not fight their way out of a wet tissue towel , say , and over came the people of the wild , blue yonder . " They were still taking off from the fields where they lived on that green-grassed aircraft carrier that they called England , when we saw the first of them . " Shining , bright and beautiful , because they had scraped the invasion paint by then , or maybe they had not . My memory is not exact about this part . " Anyway , Daughter , you could see the line of them going back toward the east further than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were high in the sky and never more beautiful . I told my S-2 that we should call them the Valhalla Express . Are you tired of it ? " " No . I can see the Valhalla Express . We never saw it in such numbers . But we saw it . Many times . " " We were back two thousand yards from where we were to take off from . You know what two thousand yards is , Daughter , in a war when you are attacking ? " " No . How could I ? " " Then the front part of the Valhalla Express dropped coloured smoke and turned and went home . This smoke was dropped accurately , and clearly showed the targetp224which was the Kraut positions . They were good positions and it might have been impossible to move him out of them without something mighty and picturesque such as we were experiencing . " Then , Daughter , the next sections of the Valhalla expressdropped everything in the world on the Krauts and where they lived and worked to hold us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth had erupted and the prisoners that we took shook as a man shakes when his malaria hits him . They were very brave boys from the Sixth Parachute Division and they all shook and could not control it though they tried . " So you can see it was a good bombing . Just the thing we always need in this life . Make them tremble in the fear of justice and of might . " So then daughter , not to bore you , the wind was from the east and the smoke began to blow back in our direction . The heavies were bombing on the smoke line and the smoke line was now over us . Therefore they bombed us the same as they had bombed the Krauts . First it was the heavies , and no one need ever worry about hell who was there that day . Then , to really make the break-through good and to leave as few people as possible on either side , the mediums came over and bombed who was left . Then we made the break-through as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and its majesty from that part of France to all over England . " If a man has a conscience , the Colonel thought , he might think about air-power some time.  | " Give me a glass of that Valpolicella , " the Colonel said , and remembered to add , " please . " " Excuse me , " he said . " Be comfortable , honey dog , please . You asked me to tell you . " " I 'm not your honey dog . That must be someone else . " " Correct . You 're my last and true and only love . Is that correct ? But you asked me to tell you . " " Please tell me , " the girl said . " I 'd like to be your honey dog if I knew how to do it . But I am only a girl from this town that loves you . " " We 'll operate on that , " the Colonel said . " And I love you . I probably picked up that phrase in the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I would rather be your straight girl . " " You are , " the Colonel said . " Complete with handles and with the flag on top . " " Please do n't be rough , " she said . " Please love me true and tell me as true as you can , without hurting yourself in any way . " " I 'll tell you true , " he said . " As true as I can tell and let it hurt who it hurts . It is better that you hear it from me , if you have curiosity on this subject , than that you read it in some book with stiff covers . " " Please do n't be rough . Just tell me true and hold me tight and tell me true until you are purged of it ; if that can be . " " I do n't need to purge , " he said . " Except heavies being used tactically . I have nothing against them if they use them right even if they kill you . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a man who will boot them in . " " Please . " " If you ever want to quit a beat-up character like me that guy could give you ground support . " " You are not beat-up , whatever that is , and I love you . " " Please give me two tablets from that bottle and pour the glass of Valpolicella that you neglected to pour , and I will tell you some of the rest of it . " " You do n't have to . You do n't have to tell me and I know now it is not good for you . Especially not the Valhalla Express day . I am not an inquisitor ; or whatever the female of inquisitor is . Let us just lie quietly and look out of the window , and watch and see what happens on our Grand Canal . " " Maybe we better . Who gives a damn about the war anyway ? " " You and me , maybe , " she said and stroked his head . " Here are the two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decanted vino . I 'll send you better from our own estates . Please let us sleep a little while . Please be a good boy and we just lie together and love each other . Please put your hand here . " " My good or my bad ? " " Your bad , " the girl said . " The one I love and must think about all week . I can not keep it like you keep the stones . " " They 're in the safe , " the Colonel said . " In your name , " he added.  | " Let 's just sleep and not talk about any material things nor any sorrows . " " The hell with sorrows , " the Colonel said with his eyes closed and his head resting lightly on the black sweater that was his fatherland . You have to have some damned fatherland , he thought . Here is mine . " Why are n't you President ? " the girl asked . " You could be an excellent president . " " Me President ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I never wore a bow tie in my life and I am not , nor ever have been , an unsuccessful haberdasher . I have none of the qualifications for the Presidency . I could n't even head the opposition even though I do n't have to sit on telephone books to have my picture taken . Nor am a no-fight general . Hell , I never even was at SHAEF . I could n't even be an elder statesman . I 'm not old enough . Now we are governed in some way , by the dregs . We are governed by what you find in the bottom of dead beer glasses that whores have dunked their cigarettes in . The place has not even been swept out yet and they have an amateur pianist beating on the box . " " I do n't understand it because my American is so incomplete . But it sounds awful . But do n't be angry about it . Let me be angry for you . " " Do you know what an unsuccessful haberdasher is ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them in our country . There is at least one in every town . No , Daughter , I am only a fighting soldier and that is the lowest thing onp228earth . In that you run for Arlington , if they return the body . The family has a choice . " " Is Arlington nice ? " " I do n't know , " the Colonel said . " I was never buried there . " " Where would you like to be buried ? " " Up in the hills , " he said , making a quick decision . " Onany part of the high ground where we beat them . " " I suppose you should be buried on the Grappa . " " On the dead angle of any shell-pocked slope if theywould graze cattle over me in the summer time . " " Do they have cattle there ? " " Sure . They always have cattle where there is good grass in the summer , and the girls of the highest houses , the strong built ones , the houses and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foxes in the fall after they bring the cattle down . They feed from pole-stacked hay . " " And you do n't want Arlington or Pere Lachaise or what we have here ? " " Your miserable boneyard . " " I know it is the most unworthy thing about the town . The city rather . I learned to call cities towns from you . But I will see that you go where you wish to go and I will go with you if you like . " " I would not like . That is the one thing we do alone . Like going to the bathroom . " " Please do not be rough . " " I meant that I would love to have you with me . But it is very egotistical and an ugly process . "  |p229He  stopped , and thought truly , but off-key , and said , " No . You get married and have five sons and call them all Richard .

" The unjust bitter criticizer who speaks badly of everyone . " " Please do n't be rough in talking , " the girl said . " And remember you speak worst of all about yourself . But hold me as close as we can and let 's think about nothing . " He held her as close as he could and he tried to think about nothing.  |p230T1HE  Colonel and the girl lay quietly on the bed and the Colonel tried to think of nothing ; as he had thought of nothing so many times in so many places . But it was no good now . It would not work any more because it was too late . They were not Othello and Desdemona , thank God , although it was the same town and the girl was certainly better looking than the Shakespearean character , and the Colonel had fought as many , or more times than the garrulous Moor . They are excellent soldiers , he thought . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed in my time ? I think we killed more than a generation if you count the final Moroccan campaign against Abdel Krim . And each one you have to kill separately . Nobody ever killed them in mass , as we killed Krauts before they discovered Einheit.  | " Daughter , " he said . " Do you want me to really tell you , so you will know , if I am not rough telling it ? " " I would rather have you tell me than anything . Then we can share it . " " It cuts pretty thin for sharing , " the Colonel said . " It 's all yours , Daughter . And it 's only the high-lights . You would n't understand the campaigns in detail , and few others would . Rommel might . But they always had him under wraps in France and , besides , we had destroyed his communications . The two tactical air-forces had ; ours and the RAF . But I wish I could talk over certain things with him . I 'd like to talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what you wish and take this glass of Valpolicella and stop if it makes you feel badly . Or do n't tell it at all . " " I was a spare-parts Colonel at the start , " the Colonel explained carefully . " They are hang-around Colonels , which are given to a Division Commander to replace one that he may have killed , or that are relieved . Almost none are killed ; but many are relieved . All the good ones are promoted . Fairly fast when the thing starts to move sort of like a forest fire . " " Go on , please . Should you take your medicine ? " " The hell with my medicine , " the Colonel said . " And the hell with SHAEF . " " You explained that to me , " the girl said . " I wish the hell you were a soldier with your straight true brain and your beauty memory . " " I would wish to be a soldier if I could fight under you .

The people who fought on luck are all gloriously dead like Napoleon 's horse cavalry . " " Why do you hate cavalry ? Almost all the good boys 1 know were in the three good regiments of cavalry , or in the navy . " " I do n't hate anything , Daughter , " the Colonel said , and drank a little of the light , dry , red wine which was as friendly as the house of your brother , if you and your brother are good friends . " I only have a point of view , arrived at after careful consideration , and an estimate of their capabilities . " " Are they not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel said . Then , remembering to be kind , added , " In our time . " " Every day is a disillusion . " " No . Every day is a new and fine illusion . But you can cut out everything phony about the illusion as though you would cut it with a straight-edge razor . " " Please never cut me . " " You 're not cut-able . " " Would you kiss me and hold me tight , and we bothp233look at the Grand Canal where the light is lovely now , and you tell me more ? " When they were looking out at the Grand Canal where the light was , indeed , lovely , the Colonel went on , " I got a regiment because the Commanding General relieved a boy that I had known since he was eighteen years old . He was not a boy any more , of course . It was too much regiment for him and it was all the regiment I ever could have hoped for in this life until I lost it . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you lose a regiment ? " " When you are working around to get up on the high ground and all you would have to do is send in a flag , and they would talk it over and come out if you were right . The professionals are very intelligent and these Krauts were all professionals ; not the fanatics . The phone rings and somebody calls from Corps who has his orders from Army or maybe Army Group or maybe even SHAEF , because they read the name of the town in a newspaper , possibly sent in from Spa , by a correspondent , and the order is to take it by assault . It 's important because it got into the newspapers . You have to take it . " So you leave one company dead along a draw . You lose one company complete and you destroy three others . The tanks get smacked even as fast as they could move and they could move fast both ways . " They hit them one , two , three , four , five . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are inside ) and they run like broken-field runners that have beenp234shaken loose in a play when you are Minnesota and the others are Beloit , Wisconsin . " Do I bore you ? " " No . I do not understand the local allusions . But you can explain them when you care to . Please keep on telling me . " You get into the town , and some handsome jerk puts an air mission on you . This mission might have been ordered and never cancelled . Let 's give everyone the benefit of the doubt . I 'm just telling you about things in a general way . It is better not to be specific and a civilian would n't understand it . Not even you . " This air mission does not help much , Daughter . Becausemaybe you can not stay in the town because you have got too few people in , and by now , you are digging them out of rubble ; or leaving them in rubble . There are two schools of thought on that . So they say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has been rigidly confirmed by some politician in uniform who has never killed in his life , except with his mouth over the telephone , or on paper , nor ever has been hit . Figure him as our next President if you want him . Figure him any way you like . But figure him and his people , the whole great business establishment , so far back that the best way to communicate with them rapidly would be by racing carrier pigeons . Except , with the amount of security they maintained for their proper persons , they would probably have their anti-aircraft shoot the pigeons down . If they could hit them.  | " So you do it again . Then I will tell you what it looks like . " The Colonel looked up at the play of the light on the ceiling . It was reflected , in part , from the Canal . It made strange but steady movements , changing , as the current of a trout stream changes , but remaining , still changing as the sun moved . Then he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grown-up child 's face that broke his heart , that he would be leaving before 1335 ( that was sure ) and he said , " Let 's not talk about the war , Daughter . " " Please , " she said . " Please . Then I will have it all this week . " " That 's a short sentence . I mean using the word sentence as a jail sentence . " " You do n't know how long a week can be when you are nineteen . " " Several times I have known how long an hour can be , " the Colonel said . " I could tell you how long two minutes and a half can be . " " Please tell me . " " Well I had two days ' leave in Paris between the SchneeEifelfight and this one , and due to my friendship with one or two people I was privileged to be present at some sort of a meeting , where only the accredited and trusted were present , and General Walter Bedell Smith explained to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Hurtgen Forest would be . It was not really Hurtgen Forest . That was only a small sector . It was the Stadtswaldp236and it was where the German High Command had figured , exactly , to fight after Aachen had been taken and the road into Germany breached . I hope I am not boring you . " " You never bore me . Nothing about fighting bores me except lies . " " You 're a strange girl . " " Yes , " she said . " I 've known that for quite a long time . " " Would you really like to fight ? " " I do n't know if I could do it . But I could try if you taught me . " " I 'll never teach you . I 'll just tell you anecdotes . " " Sad stories of the death of kings . " " No . GI 's somebody christened them . God how I hate that word and how it was used . Comic book readers . All from some certain place . Most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper called The Stars and Stripes ' and you had to get your unit into it , or you were unsuccessful as a commander . I was mostly unsuccessful . I tried to like the correspondents and there were some very good ones present at this meeting . I will not name names because I might omit some fine ones and that would be unjust . There were good ones that I do n't remember . Then , there were draft dodgers , phonies who claimed they were wounded if a piece of spent metal ever touched them , people who wore the purple heart from jeep accidents , insiders , cowards , liars , thieves and telephone racers . There were a few deads missing from this briefing . They had deads too . A big percentage . But none of the deads werep237present as I said . They had women at it though in wonderfuluniforms . " " But how did you ever marry one ? " " By mistake as I explained before . " " Go on and tell me . " " There were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best day , " the Colonel continued . " There were the Big Picture , the Semi-Big Picture and the SuperBig-Picture . All these people pretended to understand them , as did the boys with the pointers , a sort of half-assed billiard cue that they used for explanation . " " Do n't say rough words . I do n't know , even , what halfassedmeans . " " Shortened , or abbreviated in an inefficient manner , " the Colonel explained . " Or deficient as an instrument , or in character . It 's an old word . You could probably find it in Sanscrit . " " Please tell me . " " What for ? Why should I perpetuate ignominy just with my mouth ? " " I 'll write it if you want . I can write truly what I hear or think . I would make mistakes of course . " " You are a lucky girl if you can write truly what you hear or think . But do n't you ever write one word of this . " He resumed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their taste . Some are cynical and some are extremely eager . " To ride herd on them , and to wield the pointers , there is a group of pistol-slappers . We call a pistol-slapper a non/fighting man , disguised in uniform , or you might even call it costume , who gets an erection every time the weapon slaps against his thighs . Incidentally , Daughter , the weapon , not the old pistol , the real pistol , has missed more people in combat than probably any weapon in the world . Do n't ever let anyone give you one unless you want to hit people on the head with it in Harry 's Bar . " " I never wanted to hit anyone ; except perhaps Andrea . " " If you ever hit Andrea , hit him with the barrel ; not with the butt . The butt is awfully slow , and it misses and if it lands you get blood on your hands when you put the gun away . Also please do not ever hit Andrea because he is my friend . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No . I do not think so either . Please tell me some more about the meeting , or the assembly . I think I could recognize a pistol slapper now . But I would like to be checked out more thoroughly . " " Well , the pistol-slappers , in all the pride of their pistolslappery , were awaiting the arrival of the great General who was to explain the operation . " The correspondents were muttering , or twittering , and the intelligent ones were glum or passively cheerful . Everybodysat on folding chairs as for a Chautauqua lecture . I 'm sorry about these local terms ; but we are a local people . " In comes the General . He is no pistol-slapper , but a big businessman ; an excellent politician , the executive type . The Army is the biggest business , at that moment , in the world . He takes the half-assed pointer , and he shows us ,  |p239with  complete conviction , and without forebodings , exactly what the attack will be , why we are making it , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Go on , " the girl said . " Please let me fill your glass and you , please look at the light on the ceiling . " " Fill it and I 'll look at the light and I will go on . " This high pressure salesman , and I say this with no disrespect , but with admiration for all his talents , or his talent , also told what we would have of the necessary . There would be no lack of anything . The organization called SHAEF was then based on a town named Versailles outside of Paris . We would attack to the east of Aachen a distance of some 380 kilometers from where they were based . " An army can get to be huge ; but you can close up a little bit . They finally went as far forward as Rheims which was 240 kilometers from the fighting . That was many months later . " I understand the necessity of the big executive being removed from contact with his working people . I understandabout the size of the army and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not difficult . But no one ever commanded from that far back in history . " " Tell me about the town . " " I 'll tell you , " the Colonel said . " But I do n't want to hurt you . " " You never hurt me . We are an old town and we had fighting men , always . We respect them more than all others and I hope we understand them a little . We also knowp240they are difficult . Usually , as people , they are very boring to women . " " Do I bore you ? " " What do you think ? " the girl asked . " I bore myself , Daughter . " " I do n't think you do , Richard , you would not have done something all your life if you were bored by it . Do n't lie to me please , darling , when we have so little time . " " I wo n't . " " Do n't you see you need to tell me things to purge your bitterness ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't you know I want you to die with the grace of a happy death ? Oh I 'm getting all mixed up . Do n't let me get too mixed up . " " I wo n't , Daughter . " " Tell me some more please and be just as bitter as you want . "  | " LISTEN , Daughter , " The Colonel said . " Now wewill cut out all references to glamour and to high brass , even from Kansas , where the brass grows higher than osage-orange trees along your own road . It bears a fruit you ca n't eat and it is purely Kansan . Nobody but Kansans ever had anything to do with it ; except maybe us who fought . We ate them every day . Osage oranges , " he added . " Only we called them K Rations . They were n't bad . C Rations were bad . Ten in ones were good . " So we fought . It is dull but it is informative . This is the way it goes if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It goes like this : 1300 Red S-3 : White jumped off on time . Red said they were waiting to tie in behind ' White . 1305 ( that is one o'clock and five minutes after in the afternoon , if you can remember that , Daughter ) Blue o-3 , you know what an S-3 is I hope , says , Let us know when you move . ' Red said they were waiting to tie in behind White.  | " You can see how easy it is , " the Colonel told the girl . " Everybody ought to do it before breakfast . " " We can not all be combat infantrymen , " the girl told him softly . " I respect it more than anything except good , honest fliers . Please talk , I 'm taking care of you . " " Good fliers are very good and should be respected as such , " the Colonel said . He looked up at the light on the ceiling and he was completelydesperate at the remembrance of his loss of his battalions , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regiment , ever . He had not built it . He had inheritedit . But , for a time , it had been his great joy . Now every second man in it was dead and the others nearly all were wounded . In the belly , the head , the feet or the hands , the neck , the back , the lucky buttocks , the unfortunate chest and the other places . Tree burst wounds hit men where they would never be wounded in open country . And all the wounded were wounded for life . " It was a good regiment , " he said . " You might even say it was a beautiful regiment until I destroyed it under other people 's orders . " " But why do you have to obey them when you know better ? " " In our army you obey like a dog , " the Colonel explained . " You always hope you have a good master . " " What kind of masters do you get ? " " I 've only had two good ones so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many nice people , but only two good masters . "  | " Is that why you are not a General now ? I would love it if you were a General . " " I 'd love it too , " the Colonel said . " But maybe not with the same intensity . " " Would you try to sleep , please , to please me ? " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " You see , I thought that if you slept you might get rid of them , just being asleep . " " Yes . Thank you very much , " he said . There was nothing to it , gentlemen . All a man need ever do is obey.  |p244YOU  slept quite well for a time , " the girl told him , lovingly and gently . " Is there anything you would like me to do ? " " Nothing , " the Colonel said . " Thank you . " Then he turned bad and he said , " Daughter I could sleep good straight up and down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipped . I sleep as , and when , I need it . " " I can never be like that , " the girl said , sleepily . " I sleep when I am sleepy . " " You 're lovely , " the Colonel told her . " And you sleep better than anyone ever slept . " " I am not proud of it , " the girl said , very sleepily . " It is just something that I do . " " Do it , please . " " No . Tell me very low and soft and put your bad hand in mine . "  | " The hell with my bad hand , " the Colonel said . " Since when was it so bad . " " It 's bad , " the girl said . " Gadder , or worse , than you will ever know . Please tell me about combat without being too brutal . " " An easy assignment , " the Colonel said . " I 'll skip the times . The weather is cloudy and the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking the enemy with artillery and mortar . S-3 advises that S-6 wants Red to button up by 1700 . S-6 wants you to button up and use plenty of artillery . White reports that they are in fair shape . S-6 informs that A company will swing around and tie in with B. " B Company was stopped first by enemy action and stayed there of their own accord . S-6 is n't doing so good . This is unofficial . He wants more artillery but there is n't any more artillery . " You wanted combat for what ? I do n't know really why . Or really know why . Who wants true combat ? But here it is , Daughter , on the telephone and later I will put in the sounds and smells and anecdotes about who was killed when and where if you want them . " " I only want what you will tell me . " " I 'll tell you how it was , " the Colonel said , " and General Walter Bedell Smith does n't know how it was yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been so many times . " " I 'm glad we do n't have to know him or the nylonsmoothman , " the girl said . " We wo n't have to know them this side of hell , " thep246Colonel assured her . " And I will have a detail guarding the gates of hell so that no such characters enter . " " You sound like Dante , " she said sleepily . " I am Mister Dante , " he said . " For the moment . " And for a while he was and he drew all the circles . They were as unjust as Dante 's but he drew them.  | " I WILL skip the detailed part since you are , justifiably , and should be , sleepy , " the Colonel said . He watched , again , the strange play of the light on the ceiling . Then he looked at the girl , who was more beautiful than any girl that he had ever seen , ever . He had seen them come and go , and they go faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies . They can go faster from fair beauty to the knocker 's shop than any other animal , he thought . But I believe that this one could hold the pace and stay the course . The dark ones last the best , he thought , and look at the bony structure in that face . This one has a fine blood line too , and she can go forever . Most of our own lovely beauties come from soda counters , and they do not know their grandfather 's last name , unless , maybe , it was Schultz . Or Schlitz , he thought . This is the wrong attitude to take , he said to himself ; since he did not wish to express any of these sentiments toIp248the girl , who would not like them anyway , and was soundly sleepy now the way a cat is when it sleeps within itself . " Sleep well , my dearest lovely , and I will just tell it for nothing . " The girl was asleep , still holding his bad hand , that he despised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe when they are easily asleep . The Colonel told her all about it ; but he did not utter it . So after I had the privilege of hearing General Walter Bedell Smith explain the facility of the attack , we made it . There was the Big Red One , who believed their own publicity . There was the Ninth , which was a better Division than we were . There was us , who had always done it when they asked for you to do it . We had no time to read comic books , and we had no time for practically nothing , because we always moved before first light . This is difficult and you have to throw away the Big Picture and be a division . We wore a four-leaf clover , which meant nothing except among ourselves , who all loved it . And every time I ever see it the same thing happens in my inner guts . Some people thought that it was ivy . But it was not . It was a four-leaf clover disguised as ivy . The orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the First Infantry Division of the Army of the United States , and they , and their Calypso singing PRO never let you forget it . He was a nice guy . And it was his job . But you get fed up with horse-shit unless you like thep249aroma or the taste . I never liked it . Although I loved to walk through cow-shit when I was a kid and feel it between my toes . But horse-shit bores you . It bores me very rapidly , and I can detect it at over one thousand yards . So we attacked , the three of us in line , exactly wherethe Germans wished us to attack . We will not mention General Walter Bedell Smith any further . He is not the villain . He only made the promises and explained how it would go . There are no villains , I presume , in a Democracy . He was only just as wrong as hell . Period , he added in his mind . The patches had all been removed even as far back as the rear echelon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the three he knew so well , who were going to attack . We were going to attack with the three of us in line and nothing in reserve . I wo n't try to explain what that means , Daughter . But it is n't any good . And the place we were going to fight in , which I had taken a good look at , was going to be Passchendaele with tree bursts . I say that too much . But I think it too much . The poor bloody twenty-eighth which was up on our right had been bogged down for some time and so there was pretty accurate information available about what conditionsin those woods were going to be like . I think we could conservatively describe them as unfavorable . Then we were ordered to commit one regiment before the attack started . That means that the enemy will get at least one prisoner which makes all the taking off of the Divisional patches silly . They would be waiting for us.  |p250They  would be waiting for the old four leaf clover people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for one hundred and five days . Figures of course mean nothing to civilians . Nor to the characters from SHAEF we never saw ever in these woods . Incidentally , and of course these occurrences are always incidental at the SHAEF level , the regiment was destroyed . It was no one 's bloody fault , especially not the fault of the man who commanded it . He was a man I would be glad to spend half my time in hell with ; and may yet . It certainly would be odd if instead of going to hell , as we always counted on , we should go to one of those Kraut joints like Valhalla and not be able to get along with the people . But maybe we could get a corner table with Rommeland Udet and it would be just like any winter-sports hotel . It will probably be hell though and I do n't even believe in hell . Well anyway this regiment was rebuilt as American regiments always are by the replacement system . I wo n't describe it since you can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a replacement . It boils down , or distills , to the fact you stay in until you are hit badly or killed or go crazy and get section-eighted . But I guess it is logical and as good as any other , given the difficulties of transport . However it leaves a core of certain un-killed characters who know what the score is and no one of these characters liked the look of these woods much . You could sum up their attitude in this phrase , " Do n't shit me , Jack . " And since I had been an un-killed character for **25;4882;TOOLONG years I could understand their attitude . But they were soldiers , so most of them got killed in those woods and when we took the three towns that looked so innocent and were really fortresses . They were just built to tempt us and we had no word on them at all . To continue to use the silly parlance of my trade : this could or could not be faulty intelligence . " I feel terribly about the regiment , " the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " said the Colonel . " So do I. Let 's drink to it once . Then you go to sleep , Daughter please . The war is over and forgotten . " Please do n't think that I am conceited , Daughter , he said , without speaking . His true love was sleeping again . She slept in a different way than his career girl had slept . He did not like to remember how the career girl slept , yes he did . But he wanted to forget it . She did not sleep pretty , he thought . Not like this girl who slept as though she were awake and alive ; except she was asleep . Please sleep well , he thought . Who the hell are you to criticize career girls ? he thought . What miserable career did you attempt and have failed at ? I wished to be , and was , a General Officer in the Army of the United States . I have failed and I speak badly of all who have succeeded . Then his contrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Except the brown-nosers , the five and ten and twenty percenters and all the jerks from wherever who never fought and hold commands . " They killed several men from the academy at Gettys/burg . That was the big kill day of all kill days , when there was a certain amount of opposition by both sides . Do n't be bitter . They killed General McNair by mistake the day the Valhalla Express came over . Quit being bitter . People from the Academy were killed and there are statisticsto prove it . How can I remember if I am not bitter ? Be as bitter as you want . And tell the girl , now silently , and that will not hurt her , ever , because she is sleeping so lovely . He said lovely to himself since his thinking was often ungrammatical.  |p253SLEEP  softly , my true love , and when you wake , this will be over and I will joke you out of trying to learn details of the triste metier of war and we will go to buy the little negro , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his jeweled turban . Then you will pin him on , and we will go to have a drink at Harry 's and see whoever or whatever of our friends that will be afoot at that hour . We will lunch at Harry 's , or we 'll come back here , and I will be packed . We will say good-bye and I will get into the motoscafo with Jackson , and make some cheerful crack to the Gran Maestro and wave to any other members of the Order , and ten to one , the way I feel right now , or two will get you thirty , we will not ever see one another again . Hell , he said to no one , and certainly not aloud , I 've felt this way before many fights and almost always at somep254time in the fall of the year , and always when leaving Paris . Probably it does n't mean a thing . Who gives a damn anyway except me and the Gran Maestro and this girl ; I mean at command level . I give very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trained and adjusted by this time not to give a muck for nothing ; like the definition of a whore . A woman who does not etc . But we wo n't think about that boy , lieutenant , captain , major , colonel , general sir . We will just lay it on the line once more and the hell with it , and with its ugly face that old Hieronymus Bosch really painted . But you can sheathe your scythe , old brother death , if you have got a sheath for it . Or , he added , thinking of Hurtgen now , you can take your scythe and stick it up your ass . It was Passchendaele with tree bursts , he told nobody except the wonder light on the ceiling . Then he looked at the girl , to see that she was sleeping well enough so even his thoughts would not hurt her . Then he looked at the portrait and he thought , I have her in two positions , lying down , turned a little on her side , and looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bitch and I should never be sad about anything.  |p255THE  first day there , we lost the three battalion commanders . One killed in the first twenty minutes and the other two hit later . This is only a statistic to a journalist . But good battalion commanders have never yet grown on trees ; not even Christmas trees which was the basic tree of that woods . I do not know how many times we lost company commanders how many times over . But I could look it up . They are n't made , nor grown , as fast as a crop of potatoes is either . We got a certain amount of replacements but I can remember thinking that it would be simpler , and more effective , to shoot them in the area where they detrucked , than to have to try to bring them back from where they would be killed and bury them . It takes men to bring them back , and gasoline , and men to bury them . These men might just as well be fighting and get killed too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog , all the timep256and the roads had been mined as many as fourteen mines deep in certain stretches , so when the vehicles churned down to a new string deeper , in another part of the mud , you were always losing vehicles and , of course , the people that went with them . Besides just mortaring it all to hell and having all the firelanestaped for machine gun , and automatic weapon fire , they had the whole thing worked out and canalized so however you out-thought them you ran right into it . They also shelled you with heavy artillery fire and with at least one railway gun . It was a place where it was extremely difficult for a man to stay alive even if all he did was be there . And we were attacking all the time , and every day . Let 's not think about it . The hell with it . Maybe two things I will think about and get rid of them . One was a bare-assed piece of hill that you had to cross to get into Grosshau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was under observation with fire by 88 's , there was a little piece of dead ground where they could only hit you with a howitzer , only interdicting fires , or , from the right by mortar . When we cleaned it up we found they had good observationfor their mortars there too . This was a comparatively safe place , I 'm really not lying , not me nor anybody else . You ca n't fool those that were in Hurtgen , and if you lied they would know it the minute you opened your mouth , Colonel or no Colonel . We met a truck at this place and slowed up , and he hadp257the usual gray face and he said , " Sir , there is a dead GI in the middle of the road up ahead , and every time any vehicle goes through they have to run over him , and I 'm afraid it is making a bad impression on the troops . " " We 'll get him off the road . " So we got him off the road . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how he had been flattened and the strangeness of his flatness . Then there was one other thing , I remember . We had put an awful lot of white phosphorus on the town before we got in for good , or whatever you would call it . That was the first time I ever saw a German dog eating a roasted German kraut . Later on I saw a cat working on him too . It was a hungry cat , quite nice looking , basically . You would n't think a good German cat would eat a good German soldier , would you Daughter ? Or a good German dog eat a good German soldier 's ass which had been roasted by white phosphorus . How many could you tell like that ? Plenty , and what good would they do ? You could tell a thousand and they would not prevent war . People would say we are not fightingthe krauts and besides the cat did not eat me nor my brother Gordon , because he was in the Pacific . Maybe land crabs ate Gordon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ froze up hard ; and it was so cold they froze up with ruddy faces . Very strange . They all were gray and yellow like wax-works , in the summer . But once the winter really came they had ruddy faces.  |p258Real  soldiers never tell any one what their own dead looked like , he told the portrait . And I 'm through with this whole subject . And what about that company dead up the draw ? What about them , professional soldier ? They 're dead , he said . And I can hang and rattle . Now who would join me in a glass of Valpolicella ? What time do you think I should wake your opposite number , you girl ? We have to get to that jewelry place . And I look forward to making jokes and to talking of the most cheerfulthings . What 's cheerful , portrait ? You ought to know . You 're smarter than I am , although you have n't been around as much . All right , canvas girl , the Colonel told her , not saying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven minutes I will wake the live girl up , and we will go out on the town , and be cheerful and leave you here to be wrapped . I did n't mean to be rude . I was just joking roughly . I do n't wish to be rude ever because I will be living with you from now on . I hope , he added , and drank a glass of the wine.  |p259IT  was a sharp , cold bright day , and they stood outside the window of the jeweler 's shop and studied the two small negro heads and torsos that were carved in ebony and adorned with studded jewels . One was as good as the other , the Colonel thought . " Which do you like the best , Daughter ? " " I think the one on the right . Do n't you think he has the nicer face ? " " They both have nice faces . But I think I would rather have him attend you if it was the old days . " " Good . We 'll take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must ask the price . " " I will go in . " " No , let me ask the price . They will charge me less than they would charge you . After all you are a rich American . " " Et toi , Rimbaud ? " " You 'd make an awfully funny Verlaine , " the girl told him . " We 'll be some other famous characters . "  | " Go on in , Majesty , and we 'll buy the god damn jewel . " " You would n't make a very good Louis Sixteenth either . " " I 'd get up in that tumbril with you and still be able to spit . " " Let 's forget all the tumbrils and everyone 's sorrows , and buy the small object and then we can walk to Cipriani 's and be famous people . " Inside the shop they looked at the two heads and she asked the price , and then , there was some very rapid talk and the price was much lower . But still it was more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cipriani 's and get some money . " " No , " the girl said . Then to the clerk , " Put it in a box and send it to Cipriani 's and say the Colonel said to pay for it and hold it for him . " " Please , " the clerk said . " Exactly as you say . " They went out into the street and the sunlight and the unremitting wind . " By the way , " the Colonel said . " Your stones are in the safe at the Gritti in your name . " " Your stones . " " No , " he told her , not rough , but to make her understandtruly . " There are some things that a person can not do . You know about that . You can not marry me and I understand that , although I do not approve it . " " Very well , " the girl said . " I understand . But would you take one for a lucky stone ? " " No . I could n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait has value . " " hat is different . " " Yes , " she agreed . " I suppose so . I think I begin to understand . " " I would accept a horse from you , if I was poor and young , and riding very well . But I could not take a motor-car . " " I understand it now very well . Where can we go now , at this minute , where you can kiss me ? " " In this side alley , if you know no one who lives in it . " " I do n't care who lives in it . I want to feel you hold me tight and kiss me . " They turned into the side street and walked toward its blind end . " Oh , Richard , " she said . " Oh , my dear . " " I love you . " " Please love me . " " I do . " The wind had blown her hair up and around his neck and he kissed her once more with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , suddenly , and hard , and looked at him , and said , " I suppose we had better go to Harry 's . " " I suppose so . Do you want to play historical personages ? " " Yes , " she said . " Let us play that you are you and Iam me . " " Let 's play , " the Colonel said.  |p262THERE  was no one in Harry 's except some early morning drinkers that the Colonel did not know , and two men that were doing business at the back of the bar . There were hours at Harry 's when it filled with the people that you knew , with the same rushing regularity as the tide coming in at Mont St. Michel . Except , the Colonel thought , the hours of the tides change each day with the moon , and the hours at Harry 's are as the Greenwich Meridian , or the standard meter in Paris , or the good opinion the French military hold of themselves . " Do you know any of these morning drinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not a morning drinker so I have never met them . " " They will be swept out when the tide comes in . " " No . They will leave , just as it comes , of their own accord . "  | " o you mind being here out of season ? " " Did you think I was a snob because I come from an old family ? We 're the ones who are not snobs . The snobs are what you call jerks , and the people with all the new money . Did you ever see so much new money ? " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " I saw it in Kansas City when I used to come in from Ft . Riley to play polo at the CountryClub . " " Was it as bad as here ? " " No , it was quite pleasant . I liked it and that part of Kansas City is very beautiful . " " Is it really ? I wish that we could go there . Do they have the camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay at ? " " Surely . But we 'll stay at the Muehlebach hotel which has the biggest beds in the world and we 'll pretend that we are oil millionaires . " " Where will we leave the Cadillac ? " " Is it a Cadillac now ? " " Yes . Unless you want to take the big Buick Roadmaster , with the Dynaflow drive . I 've driven it all over Europe . It was in that last Vogue you sent me . " " We 'd probably better just use one at a time , " the Colonel said . " Whichever one we decide to use we will park in the garage alongside the Muehlebach . " " Is the Muehlebach very splendid ? " " Wonderful . You 'll love it . When we leave town we 'll drive north to St. Joe and have a drink in the bar at the Roubidoux , maybe two drinks , and then we will cross thep264river and go west . You can drive , and we can spell each other . " " What is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm driving now . " " Let 's skip the dull part and get to Chimney Rock and go on to Scott 's Bluff and Torrington and after that you will begin to see it . " " I have the road maps and the guides and that man who says where to eat , and the A.A.A. guide to the camps and the hotels . " " Do you work on this much ? " " I work at it in the evenings , with the things you sent me . What kind of a license will we have ? " " Missouri . We 'll buy the car in Kansas City . We fly to Kansas City , do n't you remember ? Or we can go on a really good train . " " I thought we flew to Albuquerque . " " That was another time . " " Will we stop early in the afternoons at the best Motel in the A.A.A. book and I make you any drinks you want while you read the paper and Life and Time and Newsweek , and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . But we come back here too . " " Of course . With our car . On an Italian liner ; whicheverone is best then . We drive straight here from Genova . " " You do n't want to stop anywhere for the night ? " " Why ? We want to get home to our own house . "  | " Where will our house be ? " " We can decide that any time . There are always plenty of houses in this town . Would you like to live in the countrytoo ? " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " Why not ? " " Then we could see the trees when we woke up . What sort of trees will we see on this journey ? " " Pine mostly , and cotton-wood along the creeks , and aspen . Wait till you see the aspen turn yellow in the fall . " " I 'm waiting . Where will we stay in Wyoming ? " " We 'll go to Sheridan first and then decide . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the car we 'll drive to where they had the Wagon-Box Fight and I 'll tell you about it . We will drive up , on the way to Billings , to where they killed that fool George Armstrong Custer , and you can see the markers where everybody died and I 'll explain the fight to you . " " That will be wonderful . Which is Sheridan more like , Mantova or Verona or Vicenza ? " " It is n't like any of those . It is right up against the mountains , almost like Schio . " " Is it like Cortina then ? " " Nothing like . Cortina is in a high valley in the mountains . Sheridan lays right up against them . They are n't any foot-hills to the Big Horns . They rise high out of the plateau . You can see Cloud 's Peak . " " Will our cars climb them properly ? "  | " You 're damn right they will . But I would much rather not have any hydromatic drive . " " I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held herselfstraight and hard not to cry . " As I can do without everything else . " " What are you drinking ? " the Colonel said . " We have n't even ordered yet . " " I do n't think I will drink anything . " " Two very dry Martinis , " the Colonel said to the bartender , " and a glass of cold water . " He reached into his pocket and unscrewed the top of the medicine bottle , and shook two of the big tablets into his left hand . With them in his hand , he screwed the top back on the bottle . It was no feat for a man with a bad right hand . " I said I did n't want to drink anything . " " I know daughter . But I thought you might need one . We can leave it on the bar . Or I can drink it myself . Please , " he said . " I did not mean to be brusque . " " We have n't asked for the little negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I did not want to ask for him until Cipriani came in and I could pay for him . " " Is everything that rigid ? " " With me , I guess , " the Colonel said . " I 'm sorry daughter . " " Say daughter three times straight . " " Hija , figlia , Daughter . " " I do n't know , " she said . " I think we should just leavep267here . I love to have people see us , but I do n't want to see anybody . " " The box with the negro in it is on top of the cash register . " " I know . I 've seen it for sometime . " The bar-tender came , with the two drinks , frost cold from the chilled coldness of the glasses , and he brought the glass of water . " Give me that small packet that came in my name and is on top of the cash register , " the Colonel said to him . " Tell Cipriani I will send him a check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you want your drink , daughter ? " " Yes . If you do n't mind me changing my mind too . " They drank , after touching the glasses very lightly , so lightly that the contact was almost imperceptible . " You were right , " she said feeling its warmth and its momentary destruction of sorrow . " You were right too , " he said and palmed the two tablets . He thought taking them with the water now was in bad taste . So , when the girl turned her head a moment to watch a morning drinker go out the door , he swallowed them with the Martini . " Should we go , Daughter ? " " Yes . By all means . " " Bar-tender , " the Colonel said . " How much are these drinks ? And do not forget to tell Cipriani I am sending him a check for this nonsense . "  |p268THEY  ate lunch at the Gritti , and the girl had unwrapped the small ebony negro 's head and torso , and pinned it high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , and was quite lovely to look at if you liked that sort of thing . And if you do n't you are stupid , the Colonel thought . But do not even think rough , he told himself . You have to be good now in every way until you say good-bye . What a word , he thought , good-bye . It sounds like a Valentine slogan . Good-bye and bonne chance and hasta la vista . We always just said merde and let it go at that . Farewell , he thought , that is a nice word . It sings well , he thought . Farewell , a long farewell and take it with you where you go . With handles , he thought . " Daughter , " he said . " How long has it been since I told you that I loved you ? "  | " Not since we sat at the table . " " I tell you now . " She had combed her hair with patience when they came into the hotel and she had gone into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used lipstick to make the sort of mouth she knew he most desired , and she had said to herself , making the mouth correctly , " Do n't think at all . Do n't think . Above all do n't be sad because he is going now . " " You look beautiful . " " Thank you . I would like to be beautiful for you if I could and if I could be beautiful . " " Italian is a lovely language . " " Yes . Mister Dante thought so . " " Gran Maestro , " the Colonel said . " What is there to eat in this Wirtscha f t ? " The Gran Maestro had been observing , without observing , with affection and without envy . " Do you want meat , or fish ? " " It 's Saturday , " the Colonel said . " Fish is not compulsory . So I 'll take it . " " It is sole , " the Gran Maestro said . " What do you want , my Lady ? " " Whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I like it all . " " Make a decision , Daughter . " " No . I would rather leave it to some one who knows more than me . I have a boarding school appetite . " " It will come as a surprise , " the Gran Maestro said withp270his long and loving face with the grey eyebrows over the softly hooded eyes , and the ever happy face of the old soldier who is still alive and appreciates it . " Is there any news from the Order ? " the Colonel asked . " Only that our leader , Himself , is in trouble . They have confiscated everything he owns . Or at any rate they have intervened . " " I hope it is not serious . " " We will have confidence in our leader . He has ridden out worse tempests than this . " " To our leader , " the Colonel said . He raised his glass , which had been filled with the decanted new and true Valpolicella . " Drink to him , daughter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl said . " Besides I do not belong to the Order . " " You are a member now , " the Gran Maestro said . " For merito di guerra . " " I 'll drink to him then , " she said . " Am I really a member of the Order ? " " Yes , " the Gran Maestro said . " You have not received your parchment yet but I appoint you Super Honorary Secretary . My Colonel will reveal to you the secrets of the order . Reveal , please , my Colonel . " " I reveal , " the Colonel said . " There are no pitted folk about ? " " No . He is out with his Lady . Miss Baedeker . " " OK then , " the Colonel said . " I will reveal . There is only " I love you , " he said . " That 's what you can base on . I tell you truly . " " It is Saturday , " she said . " And when is next Sat-urday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter . Find me a man who can tell me about next Saturday . " " You could tell me if you would . " " I 'll ask the Gran Maestro , maybe he knows . Gran Maestro when will next Saturday come ? " " A Paques ou d la Trinite , " the Gran Maestro said . " Why do n't we have any smells from the kitchen to cheer us up ? " " Because the wind is from the wrong direction . " Yes , the Colonel thought . The wind is from the wrong direction and how lucky I would have been to have had this girl instead of the woman that I pay alimony to , who could not even make a child . She hired out for that . But who should criticise whose tubes ? I only criticize Goodrich or Firestone or General . Keep it clean , he said to himself . And love your girl . She was there beside him , wishing to be loved , if he had any love to give . It came back , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " How are you with the crow wing hair and the breakheart face ? " " I 'm fine . " " Gran Maestro , " the Colonel said . " Produce a few smells or something from your off-stage kitchen , even if the wind is against us. "  |p274THE  hall porter had telephoned , under the direction of the concierge , and it was the same motor boat that they had ridden in before . T 5 Jackson was in the boat with the luggage , and the portrait , which had been well and sturdily wrapped . It was still blowing hard . The Colonel had paid his bill and made the proper tips . The people of the hotel had put the luggage and the picture in the boat , and seen that Jackson was seated properly . Then they had retired . " Well , daughter , " the Colonel said . " Ca n't I ride with you to the garage ? " " It would be just as bad at the garage . " " Please let me ride to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It 's your show , really . Get in . " They did not talk at all , and the wind was a stern windp275so that , with what speed the old calamity of a motor made , there seemed almost to be no wind at all . At the landing place , where Jackson was handing the luggage to a porter , and looking after the portrait himself , the Colonel said , " Do you want to say good-bye here ? " " Do I have to ? " " No . " " May I come up to the bar in the garage while they are getting the car down ? " " That will be worse . " " I do not care . " " Get that stuff up to the garage , and have somebody look after it until you get the car down , " the Colonel said to Jackson . " Check on my guns and pack this stuff in a way to give the maximum space in the rear seat . " " Yes , sir , " Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl asked . " No , " the Colonel told her . " Why ca n't I go ? " " You know very well . You were n't invited . " " Please do n't be bad . " " Christ , Daughter , if you knew how hard I am trying not to be . It 's easy if you 're bad . Let 's pay this good man off , and go over and sit on the bench there under the tree . " He paid the owner of the motor boat , and told him that he had not forgotten about the jeep engine . He also told him not to count on it , but that there was a good chance that he could get it.  | " It will be a used engine . But it will be better than that coffee pot you have in there now . " They went up the worn stone steps and walked across the gravel and sat on a bench under the trees . The trees were black and moved in the wind , and there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year , and been swept up long ago . A man came over to offer postcards for sale and the Colonel told him , " Run along , son . We do n't need you now . " The girl was crying , finally , although she had made the decision never to cry . " Look , Daughter , " the Colonel said . " There is n't anything to say . They did n't install shock-absorbers in this vehicle we ride in now . " " I 've stopped , " she said . " I 'm not an hysterical . " " I would n't say you were . I 'd say you were the loveliestand most beautiful girl that ever lived . Any time . Anyplace . Anywhere . " " If it were true , what difference would it make ? " " You have me there , " the Colonel said . " But it is true . " " So now what ? " " So now we stand up and kiss each other and say good-bye . " " What 's that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I guess that is one of the things everybody has to figure out for themselves . " " I 'll try to figure it . " " Just take it as easy as you can , Daughter . "  | " Yes , " the girl said . " In the vehicle without the shock-absorbers . " " You were tumbril bait from the start . " " Ca n't you do anything kindly ? " " I guess not . But I 've tried . " " Please keep on trying . That 's all the hope we have . " " I 'll keep on trying . " So they held each other close and kissed each other hard and true , and the Colonel took the girl across the stretch of gravel and down the stone steps . " You ought to take a good one . Not that old displaced engine boat . " " I 'd rather take the displaced engine boat if you do n't mind . " " Mind ? " the Colonel said . " Not me . I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good-bye , my dear , lovely , beautiful . " " Good-bye , " she said.  |p278HE  was in the sunken oak hogshead that they used in the Veneto for blinds . A blind is any artifice you use to hide the shooter from that which he is attempting to shoot , which , in this case , were ducks . It had been a good trip out with the boys , once they had met in the garage , and a good evening with excellent food cooked on the old open-hearth kitchen . Three shooters rode in the rear seat , on the way to the shooting place . Those who did not lie had permitted themselves a certain amount of exaggeration and the liars had never been in fuller flower . A liar , in full flower , the Colonel had thought , is as beautiful as cherry trees , or apple trees when they are in blossom . Who should ever discourage a liar , he thought , unless he is giving you co-ordinates ? The Colonel had collected liars all his life , as some men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atp279the moment , nor treasure them truly . He just enjoyed , completely , hearing them lie at the moment , unless , of course , something concerned with duty was involved . Last night there had been a fair amount of good lying after the grappa had been passed around , and the Colonel had enjoyed it . There had been smoke in the room from the open charcoalfire ; no , there were logs , he thought . Anyway a liar lies best when there is a little smoke or when the sun has set . He had come close to lying twice himself , and had held it up , and merely exaggerated . I hope anyway , he thought . Now here was the frozen lagoon to ruin everything . But it was not ruined . A pair of pin-tails came , suddenly , from nowhere , slantingdown fast in a dive no airplane ever made , and the Colonel heard their feathered trajectory and swung and killed the drake . He lay on the ice , hitting it as solid as a duck can hit ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed his mate , who was climbing , long-necked and fast . She fell alongside the drake . So it is murder , the Colonel thought . And what is n't nowadays ? But , boy , you can still shoot . Boy , hell , he thought . You beat-up old bastard . But look at them come now . They were widgeon , and they came in a whisp that coagulated and then stretched to nothing . Then they co/agulated again and the treacherous duck on the ice started to talk to them . Let them turn once more , the Colonel said to himself . Keep your head down , and do not move even your eyes . They are going to come in . They came in well , with treachery speaking to them . Their wings were suddenly set to alight , as when you lower the flaps . Then they saw it was ice and they rose , climbing . The shooter , who was not a Colonel now , nor anything but a gun handler , rose in the wooden barrel and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big ducks . Two is enough from one family , the Colonel said . Or was it one tribe ? The Colonel heard a shot behind him , where he knew there was no other blind , and turned his head to look across the frozen lagoon to the far , sedge-lined shore . That does it , he thought . A bunch of mallards , that had been coming in low , were flaring up into the sky , seeming to stand on their tails as they climbed . He saw one fall , then heard another shot . It was the sullen boatman shooting at the ducks that would have come to the Colonel . How , how can he do that ? the Colonel thought . The man had a shot-gun to shoot any cripples that might be escaping where the dog could not get them . For him to fire at ducks that were coming to the Colonel 's blind was , in shooting , as bad a thing as one man could do to another.  |p281The  boatman was too far away to hear a shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too far for the pellets to reach , he thought , but at least he will know that I know what he is doing . What the hell is this all about ? On a beautifully run shoot like this one too ? This is the best organized and best run duck shoot I have ever shot at and I have had as much fun shooting here as I ever had in my life . What is the matter with that son of a bitch ? He knew how bad his anger was for him . So he took two of the pills and washed them down with a drink of Gordon'sgin from his flask since there was no water . He knew the gin was bad for him too and he thought , everything is bad for me except rest and very light exercise . OK , rest and light exercise , boy . Do you suppose that is light exercise ? You , beauty , he said to himself . I wish you were here now and we were in the double blind and if we could only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd look around and see you and I would shoot the high ducks well , to show off and try to put one in the blind without having it hit you . I 'd try to pull one down like this , he said , hearing the wings in the air . He rose , turned , saw the single drake , long necked and beautiful , the wings fast moving and travellingto the sea . He saw him sharp and clear and in the sky with the mountains behind him . He met him , covered him and pulled as he swung as far back as he could swing the gun . The drake came down on the ice , just outside the , 281p282perimeter of the blind , and broke the ice as he fell . It was the ice that had been broken to put out the decoys and it had re-frozen lightly . The calling hen looked at him as he lay and shifted her feet . " You never saw him before in your life , " the Colonel said to the hen . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may have . But you did n't say anything . " The drake had hit with his head down and his head was under the ice . But the Colonel could see the beautiful winter plumage on his breast and wings . I 'd like to give her a vest made of the whole plumage the way the old Mexicans used to ornament their gods , he thought . But I suppose these ducks have to go to the market and no one would know how to skin and cure the skins anyway . It could be beautiful , though , with Mallard drake skins for the back and sprig for the front with two longitudinal stripes of teal . One coming down over each breast . Be a hell of a vest . I 'm pretty sure she 'd like it . I wish that they would fly , the Colonel thought . A few fool ducks might come in . I have to stay ready for them if they do . But none came in and he had to think . There were no shots from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good light , the birds could see the ice and they no longer carne in and instead went out to the open sea to raft up . So he had no shooting and he thought withoutintention , trying to find what had made it at the first . He knew he did not deserve it and he accepted it and he lived by it , but he sought , always , to understand it.  |p283One  time it had been two sailors when he had been walking with the girl at night . They had whistled at her and , the Colonel thought , that was a harmless enough thing and he should have let it go . But there was something wrong with it . He sensed it before he knew it . Then he knew it solidly , because he had stopped under a light , in order that they might see what he wore on his shoulders , so that they might take the other side of the street . What he wore on each shoulder was a small eagle with wings out-stretched . It was embroidered onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conspicuous , and it had been there a long time . But it was visible . The two sailors whistled again . " Stay over there against the wall if you want to watch it , " the Colonel had said to the girl . " Or look away . " " They are very big and young . " " They wo n't be big for long , " the Colonel promised her . The Colonel walked over to the whistlers . " Where is your shore patrol ? " he asked . " How would I know ? " the biggest whistler said . " All I want is a good look at the dame . " " Do people like you have names and serial numbers ? " " How would I know , " one said . The other said , " I would n't tell a chicken Colonel if I had . " Old army boy , the Colonel thought , before he hit him . Sea lawyer . Knows all his rights.  |p284But  he hit him with a left from nowhere and hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , the first whistler , had closed fast and well , for a man who had been drinking , and the Colonel gave him the elbow in the mouth and then , under the light , had a good right hand shot at him . When it was in , he glanced at the second whistler and saw that was okay . Then he threw a left hook . Then he put the right way into the body , coming up . He threw another left hook and then turned away and walked toward the girl because he did not want to hear the head hit the pavement . He checked on the one that had it first , and noted he slept peacefully , chin down , with the blood coming out of his mouth . But it was still the right color , the Colonel noted . " Well , there goes my career , " he said to the girl . " Whateverthat was . But those people certainly wear funny pants . " " How are you ? " the girl asked . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll have bad hands in the morning , " he said absentmindedly . " But I think we can walk away from it all right . But let 's walk slowly . " " Please walk slowly . " " I did not mean it that way . I meant let 's not be hurried in our departure . " " We will walk as slowly as two people can walk . " So they walked . " Do you want to try an experiment ? " p 285 " Of course . " " Let 's walk so we make even the backs of our legs look dangerous . " " I 'll try . But I do n't think I can . " " Well , let 's just walk then . " " But did n't they hit you ? " " One pretty good right behind the ear . The second boy when he came in . " " Is that what fighting 's like ? " " When you 're lucky . " " And when you 're not lucky ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do you still care for me after you have fought ? " " I love you much more than before if it were possible . " " Ca n't it be possible ? It would be nice . I love you moresince I saw that thing . Am I walking slowly enough ? " " You walk like a deer in the forest , and sometimes youwalk as well as a wolf , or an old , big coyote when he isnot hurried . " " I 'm not sure I wish to be an old big coyote . " " Wait till you see one , " the Colonel said . " You 'll wish . You walk like all the great predators , when they walk softly . And you are not a predator . " " That I can promise . " " Walk a little ahead so I can see . " She walked ahead and the Colonel said , " You walk like a champion before he is the champion . If you were a horse I would buy you if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " You do n't have to buy me . " " I know about that . That was not what we were discussing . We were discussing your gait . " " Tell me , " she said . " What happens to those men ? That 's one of the things I do n't know about fighting . Should n't I have stayed and cared for them ? " " Never , " the Colonel told her . " Remember that ; never . I hope they split a good concussion between them . They can rot . They caused the accident . There is no question of civil responsibility . We were all insured . If I can tell youone thing , Renata , about fighting . " " Tell me please . " " If you ever fight , then you must win it . That 's all that counts . All the rest is cabbage , as my old friend Dr. Rommel put it . " " Did you really like Rommel ? " " Very much . " " But he was your enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than my friends . And the Navy , you know , wins all their fights always . This I learned in a place called the Pentagon building when I was still permitted to enter that building by the front door . If you like we can stroll back down this street , or walk it fast , and ask those two that question . " " I tell you truly , Richard . I have seen enough fighting for one night . " " Me too , to tell the truth , " the Colonel said . But he said it in Italian and it started , " Anche io . Let 's go to Harry 's for one , and then I will walk you home . "  | " Did n't you hurt your bad hand ? " " No , " he explained . " I only threw it once to the head . The other times I punched to the body with it . " " May I feel it ? " " If you will feel very softly . " " But it is terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that sort of swelling always goes down . " " Do you love me ? " " Yes . I love you with two moderately swollen hands and all my heart . "  |p288S  O that was that , and maybe it was that day or maybe it was another that made the miracle . You never knew , he thought . There was the great miracle and he had never consciously implemented it . Nor , he thought , you son of a bitch , did you ever oppose it . It was colder than ever and the broken ice re-froze and the calling duck did not even look up now . She had abandonedtreachery for an attempt at security . You bitch , the Colonel thought . Though that is unjust . It is your trade . But why is it a hen calls better than a drake . You ought to know , he thought . And even that 's not true . ' What the hell is true ? Drakes actually call better . Now do n't think of her . Do n't think of Renata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might even be bad for you . Also you said good-bye . What a good-bye that was . Complete with tumbrils . And she would have climbed up in the damned tumbril with you too . Just so long as it wasp289a real tumbril . Very rough trade , he thought . Loving and leaving . People can get hurt at it . Who gave you a right to know a girl like that ? Nobody , he answered . But Andrea introduced me to her . But how could she love a sad son of a bitch like you ? I do not know , he thought truly . I truly do not know . He did not know , among other things , that the girl loved him because he had never been sad one waking morningof his life ; attack or no attack . He had experienced anguish and sorrow . But he had never been sad in the morning . They make almost none like that , and the girl , although she was a young girl , knew one when she saw one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . That is where she ought to be and not in any god damn duck blind with the decoys frozen up on us . I wish to hell she was here though , if this were a double blind , and have her looking to the west just in case one string did come in . It would be nice if she were warm enough . Maybe I can trade somebody out of one of these real down jackets that nobody ever sold that had one . The kind they issued to the Air Force once by mistake . I could find out how they are quilted and make one with duck down from here , he thought . I 'd get a good tailor to cut it and we would make it double-breasted with no pocket on the right and lay in a chamois shooting patch so the gun butt would never catch . I 'll do it , he said to himself . I 'll do it , or I will get one offp290some joker and have it cut down for her . I 'd like to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a pair of Boss over and unders . She should have guns as good as she is . I suppose a pair of Purdey 's , he thought . Just then he heard the light swish of pinions , fast beatingin the air , and looked up . But they were too high . He only looked up with his eyes . But they were so high they could see the barrel , and him in it , and the frozen-in decoys with the dejected hen , who saw them too , and quacked hard in her loyal treachery . The ducks , they were pintails , continued on their flight out toward the sea . I never give her anything , as she pointed out . There was the small moor 's head . But it does not mean anything . She selected it and I bought it . That is no way to give a gift . What I would like to give her is security , which does not exist anymore ; all my love , which is worthless ; all my worldly goods , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier suits , the medals and decorations with the citations , and some books . Also a retiredColonel 's pay . With all my worldly goods I thee endow , he thought . And she gave me her love , some hard stones , which I returned , and the picture . Well , I can always give her back the picture . I could give her my ring from V.M.I. , he thought , but where the hell did I lose that ? She would n't want a D.S.C . with cluster , nor two silver stars , nor the other junk , nor the medals of her ownp191country . Nor those of France . Nor those of Belgium . Nor the trick ones . That would be morbid . I better just give her my love . But how the hell do you send it ? And how do you keep it fresh ? They ca n't pack it in dry ice . Maybe they can . I must inquire . But how do I get that condemned jeep engine to that old man ? Figure it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Figuring things out when they were shooting at you , he added . I wish that son of a bitch that is lousing up the duck shooting had a rifle and I had a rifle . We would find out pretty soon who could figure things out . Even in a lousy barrel in a marsh where you ca n't maneuver . He 'd have to come to get me . Stop that , he said to himself , and think about your girl . You do not want to kill anyone anymore ; ever . Who are you feeding that to , he told himself . You going to run as a Christian ? You might give it an honest try . She would like you better that way . Or would she ? I do n't know , he said frankly . I honest to Christ do n't know . Maybe I will get Christian toward the end . Yes , he said , maybe you will . Who wants to make a bet on that ? " You want to bet on that ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky behind him and had commenced her small chuckling talk . They came over too high and never circled . They only looked down and went on toward the open sea . They must really be rafted up out there , the Colonelp292thought . There 's probably some punt gunner trying to sneak up on them now . They will be pretty close into the lee with the wind and someone is sneaking onto them now surely . Well , when he makes his shot some may break back this way . But with it frozen-up I suppose I really ought to pull out instead of staying here like a fool . I have killed enough and I have shot as well or better than I can shoot . Better hell , he thought . Nobody shoots better than you here except Alvarito and he 's a kid and shoots faster . But you kill fewer ducks than many bad and fair shots . Yes , I know about that . I know about that and why and we do n't go by the numbers anymore and we threw away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some miracle of chance in a war , he had been with his best friend for a moment in action in the Ardennes and they were pursuing . It was early fall and it was on a high upland with sandy roads and trails and the trees were scrub oak and pines . The enemy tank and half track prints showed clearly in the moist sand . It had rained the day before , but now it was clearing and visibility was good and you could see well across all the high , rolling country and he and his friend were glassingit as carefully as though they were hunting game . The Colonel , who was a General then , and an assistant divisional commander , knew the individual print of each tracked vehicle they were pursuing . He also knew when the enemy vehicles had run out of mines and approximatelyp293the number of rounds that remained to them . I le also had figured where they had to fight before thee reached the Siegfried . He was sure they would not fight at either of these two places but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're pretty far up for people of our exalted rank , George , " he said to his best friend . " Ahead of the point , General . " " It 's okay , " the Colonel had said . " Now we throw away the book and chase for keeps . " " I could n't agree more fully , General . Because I wrote the book myself , " his best friend said . " But suppose tiles . had left something there ? " He pointed to the logical place to defend . " They did n't leave anything there , " the Colonel had said . " They have n't enough stuff left even for a chickenshit fire-fight . " " Everybody 's right until he 's wrong , " his best friend said , adding , " General . " " I 'm right , " the Colonel said . He was right , too , although in obtaining his exact knowledge he had not fulfilled the complete spirit of the Geneva Convention which was alleged to govern the operation of war . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's nothing holding us up and I guarantee the y wo n't stop at either of those two . I did n't get that from any kraut either . That 's from my head . " He looked over the country once more , and heard the wind in the trees and smelled the heather under their bootsp294and looked once more at the tracks in the wet sand and that was the end of that story . I wonder if she 'd like that ? he thought . No . It builds me up too much . I 'd like to get somebody else to tell it to her though and build me solid . George ca n't tell it to her . He 's the only one that could tell it to her and he ca n't . He sure as hell ca n't . I 've been right over ninety-five percent of the time and that 's a hell of a batting average even in something as simple as war . But that five percent when you are wrong can certainly be something . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a noise heard off stage in my heart . My lousy chicken heart . That bastard heart certainly could n't hold the pace . Maybe he will , he thought , and took two of the tablets and a swallow of gin and looked across the gray ice . I 'm going to get that sullen character in now and pick up and get the hell to the farm house or the lodge , I suppose that I should call it . The shooting 's over.  |p295THE  COLONEL had signalled the boatman in by standing up , in the sunken barrel , firing two shots toward the empty sky , and then waving him toward the blind . The boat came in slowly , breaking ice all the way , and the man picked up the wooden decoys , caught the calling hen and put her in her sack , and , with the dog slithering on the ice , picked up the ducks . The boatman 's anger seemed to be gone and to be replaced by a solid satisfaction . " You shot very few , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was all they said and the boatman placed the ducks carefully , breasts up , on the bow of the boat and the Colonel handed his guns and the combination cartridge box and shooting stool into the boat . The Colonel got into the boat and the boatman checked the blind and unhooked the pocketed , apron-like devicep296which had hung on the inside of the blind to hold shells . Then he got into the boat too and they commenced their slow and laborious progress out through the ice to the open water of the brown canal . The Colonel worked as hard with the poling oar as he had worked coming in . But now , in the bright sunlight , with the snow mountains to the north , and the line of the sedge that marked the canal ahead of them , they worked together in complete co-ordination . Then they were into the canal , slipping breakingly in from the last ice ; then , suddenly , light-borne and the Colonel handed the big oar to the boatman and sat down . He was sweating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feet , pawed his way over the gunwale of the boat and swam to the canal bank . Shaking the water from his white bedraggledcoat , he was into the brown sedge and brush , and the Colonel watched his progress toward home by the movement of the brush . He had never received his sausage . The Colonel , feeling himself sweating , although he knew he was protected from the wind by his field jacket , took two tablets from the bottle and a sip of gin from his flask . The flask was flat and of silver with a leather cover . Under the leather cover , which was worn and stained , it was engraved , on one side , to Richard From Renata With Love . No one had ever seen this inscription except the girl , the Colonel , and the man who had engraved it . It had not been engraved in the same place it was purchased . That was in the earliest days , the Colonel thought . Now who cared ?  |p297On  the screw-on top of the flask was engraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boatman who looked at him , at the flask , and said , " What is it ? " " English grappa . " " I ' 11 try it . " He took a long drink of it ; the type of drink peasants take from a flask . " Thank you . " " Did you have good shooting ? " " I killed four ducks . The dog found three cripples shot by other people . " " Why did you shoot ? " " I 'm sorry that I shot . I shot in anger . " 1 have done that myself sometimes , the Colonel thought , and did not ask him what the anger was about . " I am sorry they did not fly better . " " Shit , " the Colonel said . " That 's the way things go . " The Colonel was watching the movement the dog made in the high grass and sedge . Suddenly he saw him stop ; he was quite still . Then he pounced . It was a high leap and a dive forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to the boatman . " Bobby , " the boatman called . " Bring . Bring . " The sedge moved and the dog came out with a mallard drake in his jaws . The gray white neck and the green head were swaying up and down as a snake 's might move . It was a movement without hope . The boatman put the boat in sharp for shore.  | " I 'll take him , " the Colonel said . " Bobby ! " He took the duck from the dog 's light-holding mouth and felt him intact and sound and beautiful to hold , and with his heart beating and his captured , hopeless eyes . He looked at him carefully , gentling him as you might gentle a horse . " He 's only wing-tipped , " he said . " We 'll keep him for a caller or to turn loose in the Spring . Here , take him and put him in the sack with the hen . " The boatman took him carefully and put him in the burlap bag that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Or , maybe she is protesting , he thought . He could not understand duck-talk through a burlap bag . " Take a shot of this , " he said to the boatman . " It 's damned cold today . " The boatman took the flask and drank deeply again . " Thank you , " he said . " Your grappa is very , very good . "  |p299T  the landing , before the long low stone house byAthe side of the canal , there were ducks laid out on the ground in rows . They were laid in groups that were never of the same number . There were a few platoons , no companies , and , the Colonel thought , I barely have a squad . The head game-keeper was standing on the bank in his high boots , his short jacket and his pushed back old felt hat , and he looked critically at the number of ducks on the bow of the boat as they came alongshore . " It was frozen-up at our post , " the Colonel said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry . It was supposed to be the best post . " " Who was top gun ? " " The Barone killed forty-two . There was a little current there that kept it open for a while . You probably did not hear the shooting because it was against the wind . " p 300 " Where is everyone ? " " They 're all gone except the Barone who is waiting for you . Your driver is asleep in the house . " " He would be , " the Colonel said . " Spread those out properly , " the head keeper told the boatman who was a game-keeper too . " I want to put them in the game book . " " There is one green-head drake in the bag who is only wing-tipped . " " Good . I will take good care of him . " " I will go inside and see the Barone . I 'll see you later . " " You must get warm , " the head keeper said . " It 's been a bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk toward the door of the house . " I 'll see you later , " he said to the boatman . " Yes , my Colonel , " the boatman said . Alvarito , the Barone , was standing by the open fire in the middle of the room . He smiled his shy smile and said in his low pitched voice , " I am sorry you did not have better shooting . " " We froze up completely . I enjoyed what there was very much . " " Are you very cold ? " " Not too cold . " " We can have something to eat . " " Thank you . I 'm not hungry . Have you eaten ? " " Yes . The others went on and I let them take my car.  |p305THEY  were out on the road now and the early darknesswas beginning . " Turn left , " the Colonel said . " That 's not the road for Trieste , sir , " Jackson said . " The hell with the road to Trieste . I ordered you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in the world to get to Trieste ? " " No , sir . I was only pointing out to the Colonel  --  " " Do n't you point me out a God-damn thing and until I direct you otherwise , do n't speak to me until you are spoken to . " " Yes , sir . " " I 'm sorry , Jackson . What I mean is I know where I 'm going and I want to think . " " Yes , sir . " They were on the old road that he knew so well and the Colonel thought , well , I sent four of the ducks Ip306promised to those I promised them to at the Gritti . There was n't enough shooting to be enough feathers to do that boy 's wife any good with feathers . But they are all big ducks and fat and they will be good eating . I forgot to give Bobby the sausage . There was no time to write Renata a note . But what could I say , in a note , that we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pad and pencil . He put on the map reading light , and with his bad hand , printed a short message in block letters . " Put that in your pocket , Jackson , and act on it if necessary . If the circumstances described occur , it is an order . " " Yes , sir , " Jackson said and took the folded order blank with one hand and put it in the top left hand pocket of his tunic . Now take it easy , the Colonel said to himself . Any further concern you may have is about yourself and that is just a luxury . You are no longer of any real use to the Army of the United States . That has been made quite clear . You have said good-bye to your girl and she has saidgood-bye to you . That is certainly simple . You shot well and Alvarito understands . That is that . So what the hell do you have to worry about , boy ? I hope you 're not the type of jerk who worries about what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's certainly hope not.  |p307Just  then it hit him as he had known it would since they had picked up the decoys . Three strikes is out , he thought , and they gave me four . I 've always been a lucky son of a bitch . It hit him again , badly . " Jackson , " he said . " Do you know what General Thomas J. Jackson said on one occasion ? On the occasion of his unfortunate death . I memorized it once . I ca n't respondfor its accuracy of course . But this is how it was reported : Order A. P. Hill to prepare for action . ' Then some more delirious crap . Then he said , No , no , let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the trees . ' " " That 's very interesting , sir , " Jackson said . " That must have been Stonewall Jackson , sir . " The Colonel started to speak but he stopped while it hit him the third time and gripped him so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel said . " Pull up at the side of the road and cut to your parking lights . Do you know the way to Trieste from here ? " " Yes , sir , I have my map . " " Good . I 'm now going to get into the large back seat of this god-damned , over-sized luxurious automobile . " That was the last thing the Colonel ever said . But he made the back seat all right and he shut the door . He shut it carefully and well . After a while Jackson drove the car down the ditch and willow lined road with the car 's big lights on , looking for a place to turn . He found one , finally , and turned care/fully . When he was on the right-hand side of the road , facing south toward the road juncture that would put him on the highway that led to Trieste , the one he was familiar with , he put his map light on and took out the order blank and read : IN THE EVENT OF MY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAR WILL BE RETURNED TO THE HOTEL GRITTI VENICE WHERE THEY WILL BE CLAIMED BY THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNER SIGNED RICHARD CANTWELL , COL. , INFANTRY , U.S.A. " They 'll return them all right , through channels , " Jacksonthought , and put the car in gear.  | " Some people do n't understand the Torcello part . " " I 'm damned if I do sometimes myself . " " How old are you , my Colonel , if it is not too indiscreet to ask ? " " Fifty plus one . Why did n't you find out from theconcierge ? I fill out a slip there for the Questura . " " I wanted to hear it from you yourself and to congratulate you . " " I do n't know what you are talking about . " " Let me congratulate you anyway . " " I ca n't accept it . " " You are very well liked in this city . " " Thank you . That is a very great compliment . " Just then the telephone buzzed . " I 'll take it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Who speaks ? " " Colonel Cantwell . " " The position has fallen , my Colonel . " " Which way did they go ? " " Toward the Piazza . " " Good . I will be there at once . " " Do you want a table ? " " In the corner , " said the Colonel and hung up . " I am off for Harry 's . " " Good hunting . " " I hunt ducks day after tomorrow before first light in a botte in the marshes . " " It will be cold , too . " " I dare say , " the Colonel said and put on his trench coatp76and looked at his face in the glass of the long mirror as he put on his cap . " An ugly face , " he said to the glass . " Did you ever see a more ugly face ? " " Yes , " said Arnaldo . " Mine . Every morning when I shave . " " We both ought to shave in the dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door.  |p77AS  Colonel Cantwell stepped out of the door of the Gritti Palace Hotel he came out into the last sunlight of that day . There was still sunlight on the opposite side of the Square but the gondoliers preferred to be sheltered from the cold wind by lounging in the lee of the Gritti , than to use the last remaining heat of the sun on the wind-swept side of the Square . After noting this , the Colonel turned to the right and walked along the Square to the paved street which turned off on the right . As he turned , he stopped for a moment and looked at the church of Santa Maria del Giglio . What a fine , compact and , yet , ready to be air-borne building , he thought . I never realized a small church could look like a   . Must find out when it was built , and who built it . Damn , I wish I might walk around this town all my life . All my life , he thought . What a gag that is . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on , boy , he said to himself . No horse named Morbid ever won a race . Besides , he thought , as he looked in the windows of the various shops he passed , the charcuterie with the Parmesan cheeses and the hams from San Daniele , and the sausages alla cacciatora , and the bottles of good Scotch whisky and real Gordon 's gin , the cutlery store , an antique dealer 's with some good pieces and some old maps and prints , a secondraterestaurant disguised expensively as one of the first class , and then came to the first bridge crossing a feeder canal with steps to be climbed , I do n't feel so badly . There is only the buzzing . I remember when that started and I thought perhaps it was seven year locusts in the trees and I did not like to ask young Lowry but I did . And he answered , No , General , I do n't hear any crickets or seven year locusts . The night is perfectly quiet except for the usual noises . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coming down the other side , he saw two lovely looking girls . They were beautiful and hatless and poorly but chicly dressed , and they were talking very fast to each other and the wind was blowing their hair as they climbed with their long , easy striding Venetian legs and the Colonel said to himself , I 'd better quit window gazing along this street and make that next bridge , and two squares afterwards you turn due right and keep along it till you are in Harry 's . He did just that , twinging on the bridge , but walking with his same old stride and only seeing , quickly , the peoplep79that he passed . There 's a lot of oxygen in this air , he thought , as he faced into the wind and breathed deeply . Then he was pulling open the door of Harry 's bar and was inside and he had made it again , and was at home . At the bar a tall , very tall , man , with a ravaged face of great breeding , merry blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolf , said , " My ancient and depraved Colonel . " " My wicked Andrea . " They embraced and the Colonel felt the rough texture of Andrea 's handsome tweed coat that must have been entering , at least , its twentieth year . " You look well , Andrea , " the Colonel said . It was a lie and they both knew it . " I am , " said Andrea , returning the lie . " I must say I never felt better . You look extraordinarily well , yourself . " " Thank you , Andrea . Us healthy bastards shall inherit the earth . " " Very good idea . I must say I would n't mind inheriting something these days . " " You have no kick . You 'll inherit well over six feet four of it . " " Six feet six , " said Andrea . " You wicked old man . Are you still slaving away at la vie militaire ? " " I do n't slave too hard at it , " the Colonel said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . But do n't make jokes in Spanish at this hour . Alvarito was looking for you . He said to tell you he 'd be back . "  | " Good . Is your lovely wife and are the children well ? " " Absolutely , and they asked me to remember them to you if I saw you . They 're down in Rome . There comes your girl . Or one of your girls . " He was so tall he could see into the now almost dark street , but this was a girl you could recognize if it was much darker than it was at this hour . " Ask her to have a drink with us here before you carry her off to that corner table . Is n't she a lovely girl ? " " She is . " Then she came into the room , shining in her youth and tall striding beauty , and the carelessness the wind had made of her hair . She had pale , almost olive colored skin , a profile that could break your , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , of an alive texture , hung down over her shoulders . " Hello , my great beauty , " the Colonel said . " Oh , oh , hello , " she said . " I thought I would miss you . I am so sorry to be late . " Her voice was low and delicate and she spoke English with caution . " Ciao , Andrea , " she said . " How is Emily and are the children ? " " Probably just the same as when I answered that same question for you at noon . " " I am so sorry , " she said and blushed . " I am so excited and I always say the wrong things . What should I say ? Have you had a good time here all afternoon ? " " Yes , " said Andrea . " With my old friend and severest critic . "  | " Who is that ? " " Scotch whisky and water . " " I suppose if he must tease me he must , " she said to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you ? " " Take him over to that corner table and talk to him . I 'm tired of you both . " " I 'm not tired of you , " the Colonel told him . " But I think it is a good idea . Should we have a drink sitting down , Renata ? " " I 'd love to if Andrea is n't angry . " " I 'm never angry . " " Would you have a drink with us , Andrea ? " " No , " said Andrea . " Get along to your table . I 'm sick of seeing it unoccupied . " " Good-bye , Caro . Thanks for the drink we did n't have . " " Ciao , Ricardo , " Andrea said and that was all . He turned his fine , long , tall back on them and looked into the mirror that is placed behind bars so a man can tell when he is drinking too much , and decided that he did not like what he saw there . " Ettore , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . " He walked out after waiting carefully for his coat , swinging into it , and tipping the man who brought it exactly what he should be tipped plus twenty per cent . At the corner table , Renata said , " Do you think we hurt his feelings ? " " No . He loves you and he likes me . " " Andrea is so nice . And you 're so nice . "  | " Waiter , " the Colonel called ; then asked , " Do you want a dry Martini , too ? " " Yes , " she said . " I 'd love one . " " Two very dry Martinis , " the Colonel said . " Montgomerys . Fifteen to one . " The waiter , who had been in the desert , smiled and was gone , and the Colonel turned to Renata . " You 're nice , " he said . " You 're also very beautiful and lovely and I love you . " " You always say that and I do n't know what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How old are you now ? " " Nearly nineteen . Why ? " " And you do n't know what it means ? " " No . Why should I ? Americans always say it to you before they go away . It seems to be necessary to them . But I love you very much , too , whatever that is . " " Let 's have a fine time , " the Colonel said . " Let 's not think about anything at all . " " I would like that . I can not think very well this time of day at any rate . " " Here are the drinks , " the Colonel said . " Remember not to say , chin-chin . " " I remember that from before . I never say chin-chin , nor here 's to you , nor bottom 's up . " " We just raise the glass to each other and , if you wish , we can touch the edges . " " I wish , " she said . The Martinis were icy cold and true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt them glow happily all through their upper bodies . " And what have you been doing ? " the Colonel asked . " Nothing . I still wait to go away to school . " " Where now ? " " God knows . Wherever I go to learn English . " " Turn your head and raise your chin once for me . " " You 're not making fun ? " " No . I 'm not making fun . " She turned her head and raised her chin , without vanity , nor coquetry , and the Colonel felt his heart turn over inside him , as though some sleeping animal had rolled over in its burrow and frightened , deliciously , the other animal sleeping close beside . " Oh you , " he said . " Would you ever like to run for Queen of Heaven ? " " That would be sacrilegious . " " Yes , " he said . " I suppose it would and I withdraw the suggestion . " " Richard , " she said . " No I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " The Colonel thought , I order you to say it . And she said , " Please never look at me like that . " " I 'm sorry , " the Colonel said . " I had just slipped into my trade unconsciously . " " And if we were such a thing as married would you practice your trade in the home ? " " No . I swear it . I never have . Not in my heart . "  | " With no one ? " " With no one of your sex . " " I do n't like that word your sex . It sounds as though you were practicing your trade . " " I throw my trade out of that God-damn window into the Grand Canal . " " There , " she said . " You see how quickly you practice it ? " " All right , " he said . " I love you and my trade can gently leave . " " Let me feel your hand , " she said . " It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thank you , " the Colonel said . " Please do n't , " she said . " I wanted to feel it because all last week , every night , or I think nearly every night , I dreamed about it , and it was a strange mixed-up dream and I dreamed it was the hand of Our Lord . " " That 's bad . You ought n't to do that . " " I know it . That 's just what I dreamed . " " You are n't on the junk , are you ? " " I do n't know what you mean , and please do n't make fun when I tell you something true . I dreamed just as I say . " What did the hand do ? " " Nothing . Or maybe that is not true . Mostly it was just a hand . " " Like this one ? " The Colonel asked , looking at the misshapenhand with distaste , and remembering the two times that had made it that way.  | " Not like . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers if it does not hurt ? " " It does not hurt . Where it hurts is in the head , the legs and the feet . I do n't believe there 's any sensation in that hand . " " You 're wrong , " she said . " Richard . There is very much sensation in that hand . " " I do n't like to look at it much . You do n't think we could skip it . " " Of course . But you do n't have to dream about it . " " No . I have other dreams . " " Yes . I can imagine . But I dream lately about this hand . Now that I have touched it carefully , we can talk about funny things if you like . What is there funny we should talk about ? " " Let 's look at the people and discuss them . " " That 's lovely , " she said . " And we wo n't do it with malice . Only with our best wit . Yours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Waiter , Ancora due Martini . " He did not like to call for Montgomerys in a tone that could be overheard because there were two obvious Britishers at the next table . The male might have been wounded , the Colonel thought , although , from his looks , it seems unlikely . But God help me to avoid brutality . And look at Renata 's eyes , he thought . They are probably the most beautiful of all the beautiful things she has , with the longest honest lashes I have ever seen and she never uses them for any/thing except to look at you honestly and straight . What a damn wonderful girl and what am I doing here anyway ? It is wicked . She is your last and true and only love , he thought , and that 's not evil . It is only unfortunate . No , he thought , it is damned fortunate and you are very fortunate . They sat at a small table in the corner of the room and on their right there were four women at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a mourning so theatrical that it reminded the Colonel of the Lady Diana Manners playing the nun in Max Reinhardt 's , " The Miracle . " This woman had an attractive , plump , naturally gay face and her mourning was incongruous . At the table there was another woman who had hair three times as white as hair can be , the Colonel thought . She , also , had a pleasant face . There were two other women whose faces meant nothing to the Colonel . " Are they lesbians ? " he asked the girl . " I do not know , " she said . " They are all very nice people . " " I should say they are lesbians . But maybe they are just good friends . Maybe they are both . It means nothing to me and it was not a criticism . " " You are nice when you are gentle . " " Do you suppose the word gentleman derives from a man who is gentle ? " " I do not know , " the girl said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " But I love you when you are gentle . "  | " I 'll try very hard to be gentle , " the Colonel said . " Who do you suppose that son of a bitch is at the table beyond them ? " " You do n't stay gentle very long , " the girl said . " Let us ask Ettore . " They looked at the man at the third table . He had a strange face like an over-enlarged , disappointed weasel or ferret . It looked as pock-marked and as blemished as the mountains of the moon seen through a cheap telescope and , the Colonel thought , it looked like Goebbels ' face , if Herr Goebbels had ever been in a plane that burned , and not been able to bail out before the fire reached him . Above this face , which was ceaselessly peering , as though the answer might be found by enough well directed glances and by queries , there was black hair that seemed to have no connection with the human race . The man looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced . Very interesting , the Colonel thought . Can he be a compatriot ? Yes , he must . A little spit ran out of the corner of his mouth as he spoke , peeringly , with the elderly , wholesome looking woman who was with him . She looks like anybody 's mother in an illustration in " The Ladies ' Home Journal , " the Colonel thought . " The Ladies ' Home Journal " was one of the magazines received regularly at the Officer 's Club in Trieste and the Colonel looked through it when it came . It is a wonderful magazine , he thought , because it combinessexology and beautiful foods . It makes me hungry both ways.  |p88But  who do you suppose that character is ? He looks like a caricature of an American who has been run one half way through a meat chopper and then been boiled , slightly , in oil . I 'm not being so gentle , he thought . Ettore , with his emaciated face , and his love of joking and fundamental and abiding disrespect , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual character ? " Ettore shook his head . The man was short and dark with glossy black hair that did not seem to go with his strange face . He looked , the Colonel thought , as though he had forgotten to change his wig as he grew older . Has a wonderful face though , the Colonel thought . Looks like some of the hills around Verdun . I do n't suppose he could be Goebbels and he picked up that face in the last days when they were all playing at Gotterdammerung . Komm ' Susser Tod , he thought . Well they sure bought themselves a nice big piece of Susser Tod at the end . " You do n't want a nice Susser Tod sandwich do you Miss Renata ? " " I do n't think so , " the girl said . " Though I love Bach and I am sure Cipriani could make one . " " I was not talking against Bach , " the Colonel said . " I know it . " " Hell , " the Colonel said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added . " I do n't think we have to talk against me . " " Daughter , " the Colonel said . " When will you learn that I might joke against you because I love you ? "  | " Now , " she said . " I 've learned it . But you know it 's fun not to joke too rough . " " Good . I 've learned it . " " How often do you think of me during the week ? " " All of the time . " " No . Tell me truly . " " All of the time . Truly . " " Do you think it is this bad for everyone ? " " I would n't know , " the Colonel said . " That 's one of the things I would not know . " " I hope it 's not this bad for everyone . I had no idea it could be this bad . " " Well you know now . " " Yes , " the girl said . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always . Is that the correct way to say it ? " " I know now is enough , " the Colonel said . " Ettore , that character with the inspiring face and the nice looking woman with him does n't live at the Gritti does he ? " " No , " Ettore said . " He lives next door but he goes to the Gritti sometimes to eat . " " Good , " the Colonel said . " It will be wonderful to see him if I should ever be down hearted . Who is the woman with him ? His wife ? His mother ? His daughter ? " There you have me , " Ettore said . " We have n't kept track of him in Venice . He has aroused neither love , hate , dislike , fear nor suspicion . Do you really want to know anything about him ? I could ask Cipriani . " " Let us skip him , " the girl said . " Is that how you say it ? "  | " Let 's skip him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time , Richard . He is rather a waste of time . " " I was looking at him as at a drawing by Goya . Faces are pictures too . " " Look at mine and I will look at yours . Please skip the man . He did n't come here to do anyone any harm . " " Let me look at your face and you not look at mine . " " No , " she said . " That 's not fair . I have to remember yours all week . " " And what do I do ? " the Colonel asked her . Ettore came over , unable to avoid conspiracy and , having gathered his intelligence rapidly and as a Venetian should , said , " My colleague who works at his hotel , says that he drinks three or four highballs , and then writes vastly and fluently far into the night . " " I dare say that makes marvelous reading . " " I dare say , " Ettore said . " But it was hardly the method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Colonel said . " I mean as a man . Not as a writer . " " I agree , " Ettore said . " I think you will find no one , outside of Firenze , who has studied his life who would not agree . " " Eff Florence , " the Colonel said . " A difficult maneuver , " Ettore said . " Many have attemptedit but very few have succeeded . Why do you dislikeit , my Colonel ? "  | " Too complicated to explain . But it was the depot , " he said deposito , " of my old regiment when I was a boy . " " That I can understand . I have my own reasons for dislikingit too . You know a good town ? " " Yes , " said the Colonel . " This one . A part of Milano ; - and Bologna . And Bergamo . " " Cipriani has a large store of vodka in case the Russians should come , " Ettore said , loving to joke rough . " They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still I believe Cipriani is prepared for them . " " Then he is the only man who is , " the Colonel said . " Tell him not to take any checks from junior officers on the Bank of Odessa , and thank you for the data on my compatriot . I wo n't take more of your time . " Ettore left and the girl turned toward him , and looked in his old steel eyes and put both her hands on his bad one and said , " You were quite gentle . " " And you are most beautiful and I love you . " " It 's nice to hear it anyway . " " What are we going to do about dinner ? " " I will have to call my home and find out if I can come out . " Why do you look sad now ? " " Do I ? " " Yes . " " I am not , really . I am as happy as I ever am . Truly . Please believe me , Richard . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with a man over fifty years old that you knew was going to die ? "  | " You put it a little bluntly , " the Colonel said . " But you are very beautiful when you say it . " " I never cry , " the girl said . " Never . I made a rule not to . But I would cry now . " " Do n't cry , " the Colonel said . " I 'm gentle now and the hell with the rest of it . " " Say once again that you love me . " " I love you and I love you and I love you . " " Will you do your best not to die ? " " Yes . " " What did the doctor say ? " " So-so . " " Not worse ? " " No , " he lied . " Then let us have another Martini , " the girl said . " You know I never drank a Martini until we met . " " I know . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the medicine ? " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " I should take the medicine . " " May I give it to you ? " " Yes , " the Colonel said . " You may give it to me . " They continued to sit at the table in the corner and some people went out , and others came in . The Colonel felt a little dizzy from the medicine and he let it ride . That 's the way it always is , he thought . To hell with it . He saw the girl watching him and he smiled at her . It was an old smile that he had been using for fifty years , ever since he first smiled , and it was still as sound as your grand : father 's Purdey shot-gun . I guess my older brother has that ,  |p93he  thought . Well , he could always shoot better than I could and he deserves it . " Listen , daughter , " he said . " Do n't be sorry for me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you . " " It is n't much of a trade is it ? " He said oficio instead of trade , because they spoke Spanish together too , when they left French , and when they did not wish to speak English before other people . Spanish is a rough language , the Colonel thought , rougher than a corncob sometimes . But you can say what you mean in it and make it stick . " Es un oficio bast-ante mnalo , " he repeated , " loving me . " " Yes . But it is the only one I have . " " Do n't you write any more poetry ? " " It was young girl poetry . Like young girl painting . Everyone is talented at a certain age . " At what age do you become old in this country , the Colonel thought . No one is ever old in Venice , but they grow up very fast . I grew up very rapidly in the Veneto myself , and I was never as old as I was at twenty-one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She is very well . She does not receive and she sees almost no one because of her sorrow . " " Do you think she would mind if we had a baby ? " " I do n't know . She is very intelligent , you know . But I would have to marry someone , I suppose . I do n't really want to . " " We could be married . " " No , " she said . " I thought it over , and I thought we should not . It is just a decision as the one about crying . "  | " Maybe you make wrong decisions . Christ knows I 've made a few and too many men are dead from when I was wrong . " " I think , perhaps , you exaggerate . I do n't believe you made many wrong decisions . " " Not many , " the Colonel said . " But enough . Three is plenty in my trade , and I made all three . " " I 'd like to know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel told her . " They beat the hell out of me to remember them . So what would they do to some outsider ? " " Am I an outsider ? " " No . You 're my true love . My last and only and true love . " " Did you make them early or late ? The decisions . " " I made them early . In the middle . And late . " " Would n't you tell me about them ? I would like to havea share in your sad trade . " " The hell with them , " the Colonel said . " They were made and they 've all been paid for . Only you ca n't pay for that . " " Can you tell me about that and why ? " " No , " the Colonel said . And that was the end of that . " Then let 's have fun . " " Let 's , " the Colonel said . " With our one and only life . " " Maybe there are others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Colonel said . " Turn your head sideways , beauty . " " Like this ? "  | " Like that , " the Colonel said . " Exactly like that . " So , the Colonel thought , here we come into the last round and I do not know even the number of the round . I have loved but three women and have lost them thrice . You lose them the same way you lose a battalion ; by errors of judgment ; orders that are impossible to fulfill , and through impossible conditions . Also through brutality . I have lost three battalions in my life and three women and now I have a fourth , and loveliest , and where the hell does it end ? You tell me , General , and , incidentally , while we are discussing the matter , and it is a frank discussion of the situationand in no sense a Council of War , as you have so often pointed out to me General : GENERAL WHERE IS YOUR CAVALRY ? I have thought so , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where his cavalry is , and his cavalry are not completely accurate as to their situation , nor their mission , and they will , some of them , enough , muck off as cavalry have always mucked off in all the wars since they , the Cavalry , had the big horses . " Beauty , " he said , " Ma tres chere et bien aimee . I am very dull and I am sorry . " " You are never dull , to me , and I love you and I only wish we could be cheerful tonight . " " We damn well will be , " said the Colonel . " Do you know anything particular we should be cheerful about ? " " We might be cheerful about us , and about the town . You 've often been very cheerful . "  | " Yes , " the Colonel agreed . " I have been . " " Do n't you think we could do it once more ? " " Sure . Of course . Why not ? " " Do you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is natural , and he only pushes it a little , skillfully , to be more handsome ? " " I see him , " the Colonel said . " He is a very good painter , but he has false teeth in front because he was a little bit pederaste once and other pederastes attacked him one night on the Lido when there was a full moon . " " How old are you ? " " I will be nineteen . " " How do you know this ? " " I know it from the Gondoliere . This boy is a very good painter , for now . There are n't any really good painters now . But with false teeth , now , in his twenty-fifth year , what a thing . " " I love you very truly , " the Colonel said . " I love you very truly , too . Whatever that means in American . I also love you in Italian , against all my judgmentand all of my wishes . " " We should n't wish for too God-damn much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to get it . " " I agree , " she said . " But I would like to get what I wish for now . " Neither of them said anything and then the girl said , " That boy , he is a man now , of course , and goes with very many women to hide what he is , painted my portrait once . You can have it if you like . "  | " Thank you , " the Colonel said . " I would love it . " " It is very romantic . My hair is twice as long as it has ever been and I look as though I were rising from the sea without the head wet . Actually , you rise from the sea with the hair very flat and coming to points at the end . It is almost the look of a very nearly dead rat . But Daddy paid him adequately for the portrait , and , while it is not truly me , it is the way you like to think of me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " " Of course . Very ugly . But you might like to have this portrait for a souvenir . " " Your lovely mother would not mind ? " " Mummy would not mind . She would be glad to be ridof it , I think . We have better pictures in the house . " " I love you and your mother both very much . " " I must tell her , " the girl said . " Do you think that pock-marked jerk is really a writer ? " " Yes . If Ettore says so . He loves to joke but he does not lie . Richard , what is a jerk ? Tell me truly . " " It is a little rough to state . But I think it means a man who has never worked at his trade ( oficio ) truly , and is presumptuous in some annoying way . " " I must learn to use the term properly . " " Do n't use it , " the Colonel said . Then the Colonel asked , " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wish it . I 'll have someone wrap it andsend it from the house . Where will you hang it ? " " In my quarters . " " And no one will come in and make remarks and speak badly of me ? "  | " No . They damn well will not . Also I 'll tell them it is a portrait of my daughter . " " Did you ever have a daughter ? " " No . I always wanted one . " " I can be your daughter as well as everything else . " " That would be incest . " " I do n't think that would be so terrible in a city as old as this and that has seen what this city has seen . " " Listen , Daughter . " " Good , " she said . " That was fine . I liked it . " " All right , " the Colonel said and his voice was thickened a little . " I liked it , too . " " Do you see now why I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Look , Daughter . Where should we dine ? " " Wherever you like . " " Would you eat at the Gritti ? " " Of course . " " Then call the house and ask for permission . " " No . I decided not to ask permission but to send word where I was dining . So they would not worry . " " But do you really prefer the Gritti ? " " I do . Because it is a lovely restaurant and it is where you live and anyone can look at us that wants to . " " When did you get like that ? " " I have always been like that . I have never cared what anyone thought , ever . Nor have I ever done anything that I was ashamed of except tell lies when I was a little girl and be unkind to people . "  |p99'I  wish we could be married and have five sons , " the Colonel said . " So do I , " the girl said . " And send them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five corners to the world ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " It sounded as though there were when I said it . And now we are having fun again , are n't we ? " " Yes , Daughter , " the Colonel said . " Say it again . Just as you said it . " " Yes , Daughter . " " Oh , " she said . " People must be very complicated . Please may I take your hand ? " " It 's so damned ugly and I dislike looking at it . " " You do n't know about your hand . " " That 's a matter of opinion , " he said . " I 'd say you were wrong , Daughter . " " Maybe I am wrong . But we 're having fun again and whatever the bad thing was is gone now . " " It 's gone the way the mist is burned off the hollows in broken ground when the sun comes out , " the Colonel said . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the moon , too . " " You are , " the Colonel told her . " Also any particular planet that you wish to be and I will give you an accurate location of the planet . Christ , Daughter , you can be a God-damn constellation if you like . Only that 's an air-plane . " " I 'll be the moon . She has many troubles too . "  | " Yes . Her sorrows come regularly . But she always fills before she wanes . " " She looks so sad to me sometimes across the Canal that I can not stand it . " " She 's been around a long time , " the Colonel said . " Do you think we should have one more Montgomery ? " the girl asked and the Colonel noticed that the British were gone . He had been noticing nothing but her lovely face . I 'll get killed sometime that way , he thought . On the other hand it is a form of concentration , I suppose . But it is damned careless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " They make me feel very good , " the girl said . " They have a certain effect on me , too , the way Cipriani makes them . " " Cipriani is very intelligent . " " He 's more than that . He 's able . " " Some day he 'll own all Venice . " " Not quite all , " the Colonel disagreed . " He 'll never own you . " " No , " she said . " Nor will anyone else unless you want me . " " I want you Daughter . But I do n't want to own you . " " I know it , " the girl said . " And that 's one more reason why I love you . " " Let 's get Ettore and have him call up your house . You can tell them about the portrait . " " You are quite correct . If you want the portrait tonight ,  |p301Can  you give me a lift to Latisana or just above ? I can get transportation from there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame that it should freeze . The prospects were so good . " " There must have been a world of ducks outside . " " Yes . But now they wo n't stay with their feed frozenover . They will be on their way south tonight . " " Will they all go ? " " All except our local ducks that breed here . They 'll stay as long as there is any open water . " " I 'm sorry for the shoot . " " I 'm sorry you came so far for so few ducks . " " I always love the shoot , " the Colonel said . " And I love Venice . " The Barone Alvarito looked away and spread his hands toward the fire . " Yes , " he said . " We all love Venice . Perhapsyou do the best of all . " The Colonel made no small talk on this but said , " I love Venice as you know . " " Yes . I know , " the Barone said . He looked at nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Has he eaten ? " " Eaten and slept and eaten and slept . He has also read a little in some illustrated books he brought with him . " " Comic books , " the Colonel said . " I should learn to read them , " the Barone said . He smiled the shy , dark smile . " Could you get me some from Trieste ? "  | " Any amount , " the Colonel told him . " From superman on up into the improbable . Read some for me . Look , Alvarito , what was the matter with that game-keeper who poled my boat ? He seemed to have a hatred for me at the start . Pretty well through , too . " " It was the old battle-jacket . Allied uniform affects him that way . You see he was a bit over-liberated . " " Go on . " " When the Moroccans came through here they raped both his wife and his daughter . " " I think I 'd better have a drink , " the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 302p303THEY had dropped the Barone off at a villa with great gates , a gravelled drive and a house , which , since it was over six miles from any military objective , had the good fortune not to have been bombed . The Colonel had said good-bye and Alvarito had told him to come down and shoot any , or every , week-end . " You 're sure you wo n't come in ? " " No . I must get back to Trieste . Will you give my love to Renata ? " " I will . Is that her portrait that you have wrapped in the back of the car ? " " It is . " " I 'll tell her that you shot very well and that the portrait was in good condition . " " Also my love . " " Also your love . " " Ciao , Alvarito , and thank you very much . "  | " Ciao , my Colonel . If one can say ciaou to a Colonel . " " Consider me not a Colonel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " In case of any unforeseen contingencies would you askher to have the portrait picked up at the Gritti ? " " Yes , my Colonel . " " That 's all , I guess . " " Good-bye , my Colonel . " 304p271the major secret that you must know . Correct me , Gran Maestro , if I fall into error . " " Proceed to reveal , " the Gran Maestro said . " I proceed to reveal , " the Colonel said . " Listen carefullydaughter . This is the Supreme Secret . Listen . Love is love and fun is fun . But it is always so quiet when the gold fish die . ' " " It has been revealed , " the Gran Maestro said . " I am very proud and happy to be a member of the Order , " the girl said . " But it is , in a way , a rather rough order . " " It is indeed , " the Colonel said . " And now , Gran Maestro , what do we actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the style of this town , but cold , first . Served in the shell . Then sole for you , and for my lady a mixed grill . What vegetables ? " " Whatever you have , " the Colonel said . The Gran Maestro was gone and the Colonel looked at the girl and then at the Grand Canal outside the window , and he saw the magic spots and changes of light that were even here , in the end of the bar , which had now by skillful handling been made into a dining room , and he said , " Did I tell you , daughter , that I love you ? " " You have n't told me for quite a long time . But I love you . " " What happens to people that love each other ? " " I suppose they have whatever they have , and they are more fortunate than others . Then one of them gets the emptiness forever . "  | " I wo n't be rough , " the Colonel said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any emptiness . " " I 'll try , " the girl said . " I 've been trying ever since Iwoke up . I 've tried ever since we knew each other . " " Keep on trying , daughter , " the Colonel said . Then to the Gran Maestro , who had reappeared , having given his orders , the Colonel said , " A bottle of that vino secco , from Vesuvius , for the small soles . We have the Valpolicella for the other things . " " Ca n't I drink the Vesuvius wine with my mixed grill ? " the girl asked . " Renata , daughter , " the Colonel said . " Of course . You can do anything . " " I like to drink the same wines as you if I drink wine . " " Good white wine is good with a mixed grill , at your age , " the Colonel told her . " I wish there was not such a difference in ages . " " I like it very much , " the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not continue and said , " Let 's be fraiche et rose comme au jour de bataille . " " Who said that ? " " I have n't the slightest idea . I picked it up when I took a course at the College des Marechaux . A rather pretentious title . But I graduated . What I know best I learned from the krauts , studying them and opposing them . They are the best soldiers . But they always over-reach . " " Let 's be like you said , and please tell me that you love me. "
