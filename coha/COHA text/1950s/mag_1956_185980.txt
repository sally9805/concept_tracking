GEORGE BERNARD SHAW : MAN OF THE CENTURY ( 969 pp. ) - Archibald **33;5026;TOOLONG ( $12 ) . <P> Fifty-one years ago , Bernard Shaw found his Boswell in Archibald Henderson , a stage-struck mathematics professor from the University of North Carolina . In 1911 and 1932 , Henderson produced " authorized " biographies of Ireland 's cranky genius . This book lacks the official imprimatur , because it was completed after Shaw 's death , but it is the most massively , not to say crushingly , definitive Shaw biography ever written . <P> A half-century of hero worship is not the best school for criticism . But though Henderson 's judgments on Shaw are uniformly gentle , they are not undiscerning . The only writer of whom Shaw could be said to be jealous was Shakespeare ; Henderson concedes the Beard 's criticism of the Bard to have been often " provocative , unilateral , unjust , savage and false . " And he credits Shakespeare with teaching Shaw " the technique of ultra-naturalism in dialogue , " just as Moliere schooled him in " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exaggerate characters " far beyond verisimilitude . " <P> Henderson sees that Shaw 's derision of love , romance , sexual passion , patriotism and family solidarity was the calculated result of a determined intellectual effort to make men look freshly at all they had previously accepted without question . Shaw repeatedly committed that sin against society for which Socrates was condemned to death : he made the worse seem the better part . As Albert Einstein once put it , Shaw had " succeeded in gaining the love and the joyful admiration of mankind by a path which for others has led to martyrdom . " <P> The book , which follows another vast , able biography by St. John Ervine ( TIME , Sept. 24 ) , contains much that is new , from correspondence with Sidney and Beatrice Webb to Shaw 's own words-enough of them to fill an ordinary volume . It is as thoroughly documented for the time when Shaw was a Dublin clerk as for the time of his London preeminence . Yet the total effect is one of mystery . All his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even an " authorized " biographer like Archibald Henderson is full of hesitancies in deciding which of Shaw 's contradictory views is the one he truly believed , and whether or not there was a true face beneath the many masks he wore . All he knows for certain-along with millions of theatergoers-is that all the masks show the touch of genius .
