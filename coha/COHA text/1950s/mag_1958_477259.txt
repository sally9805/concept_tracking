How a Greek monk ? who bought a monastery of his own ? managed one of the oddest hoaxes of World War II ... and infuriated the spy-masters of both Germany and England . FIRST saw Father Eugene the night four of us were brought into Calithea prison in occupied Athens in the spring of 1943 . He was then just a bearded face in the crowd of prisoners that jostled behind the bars to watch the guards search us and remove our handcuffs , and I might not even have noticed him if it had not been for the color of his cassock . Cassock is probably the wrong term . It was the sort of tight-fitting dressing-gown Greek Orthodox clerics wear under their black flowing outer robes . They are almost always of some dignified color ? dark blue or green , wine-colored , gray , or purple . Father Eugene 's was a brilliant ultramarine blue . Together with his luxuriant growth of graying hair it made a startling combination . His beard reached halfway to his waist , and the hair on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a-handsomeman , with baby-blue eyes which looked innocent and incongruous under his fierce eyebrows . No one in the prison knew for certain what he was accused of , but there were whispers of strange doings at his monastery . Some said it was a staging area for British prisoners of war escaping from occupied Greece . Others , that it was the center of large-scale black-market operations . The only point on which everyone agreed was that he did in fact own a small monastery in Attica , He was the only monk I have ever heard of who had actually bought a monastery , and used to puzzle over how he had gone about purchasing it and whether he had then " stocked " it with monks as one would a farm . In Calithea everyone had a cover story . Since only prisoners awaiting trial were kept there and there was the constant danger of informers , people tried to conceal the truth about their cases by trotting out glib and usually unconvincing versions of events . Without a doubt Father Eugene 's was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted that he was the victim of evil magic powers . During the long months we were in prison he was repeatedly hauled off to the dreaded offices of the Axis police to be interrogated . We often wondered whether he stuck to his explanation during those brutal sessions with the black-shirt boys . If he did , it must have cost him many a beating . But we never found out . A rubber hose does not leave much of a mark , and anyway no one ever saw Father Eugene undressed . He himself never said a word about it . For all we knew he might have been collaborating with the authorities . PRIESTS IN JAIL 1 1 ) 0 N ' T know how it is in other countries , but in Greece , although a village priest is respected and addressed as " Father , " even by the Communists , he is in fact very much one of the boys , a man with a job to do . In peacetime his job is to christen , marry , and bury people , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The older people go to him to confess . Sometimes he is asked for help and advice , but usually he has enough to do to make both ends meet in his own household . In times of national danger his duty is exalted . He must defend the faith , and in Greece the faith and the nation are two aspects of the same thing . The attitude toward monks is much the same . For more than a millennium the words " Greek " and " Christian " have been synonymous to the Greeks . They have preserved their heritage through the entire Christian era by guile and luck , stubbornness and courage . They could have gone the way of the Christian Syrians , turned Moslem , and lost their identity . But they did not . They remained Christian and so they remained Greek . As a result the faith in Greece has been pared down to the bare bone . It does not matter much to us whether a priest is educated or not , so long as his heart is in the right place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vows to the letter , so long as he is prepared to fight and die for his faith and for Greece . And our monks have . They have died alone and in hundreds . They have been killed in battle and roasted alive on spits ; they have been ridden naked through the streets with horseshoes nailed to their hands and knees , and they have blown themselves and their enemies to pieces when they could hold their monasteries no longer . In times of trouble they have always clone their share , and it is no coincidence that monasteries and churches in our country are so often painted blue and white ? our national colors . When you met a priest in jail during the occupation you had good grounds for giving him your confidence and respect . You could almost always assume that he was held for no light reason . There was one , an old man of more than seventy , who had been caught distributing rifles to his congregation in the church during a funeral service . There had , in fact , been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village in the empty coffin with the priest chanting in front and the women wailing behind . But Father Eugene was different . Anything seemed possible with him . There were people who warned that he might be a stool pigeon of the police , and even a few who believed that he was not a real monk at all but a British agent in disguise . I myself tried to find the truth by persistent search , and by engaging him in conversation and asking pointed questions . I got what I deserved : a mass of interesting information but nothing to the point . My curiosity , however , quickly grew into incredulous affection . He lived in one of the least desirable cells in the prison and firmly refused to move to the greater comfort of Number 17 ? the cleanest and most snobbish cell ? in spite of repeated invitations . He always went to bed after his cell-mates were asleep and arose before they were awake . No one ever saw him wash , yet he was always clean and tidy . No one came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , He never asked anyone for food and never refused it when it was given to him . He could drink like a fish and not show the slightest sign of it . He could bellow popular songs or chant Byzantine hymns in a pleasing nasal baritone voice . He could lie like a trooper . He loved jokes , but he never lost his dignity . He knew more stories than anyone I have ever met . He really seemed to believe in magic and drew a sharp distinction between the black and white varieties , maintaining that he abhorred the former and practiced the latter . I found out a great deal from him about his past , but nothing that threw any light on his case . He was born in Tiflis in the Caucasus and fled that place at the time of the Bolshevik revolution , taking refuge in a Greek town in Turkey whence he was obliged to flee again when the Greek army was defeated in 1922 and the Greek inhabitants of Asia Minor were being massacred . He told me that at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other refugees . The skipper , seeing the turn events were taking , decided to put in at a harbor held by the Turkish troops and hand his passengers over to the authorities . ' The others fell on their knees before him , pleading vainly for their fives . But not Father Eugene . He whipped out his Smith and Wesson revolver from under his robes and forced the captain to put about and land them at the nearest port in Greece . For forty-eight hours he stayed awake holding the pistol to the captain 's head . THE CHURCHILL BROADCAST AT CALITHEA Father Eugene used to come every morning into cell Number 17 and tell us the news from the BBC . How he got this news so early nobody knew . The rest of us might get bits and pieces of it smuggled in with our food baskets , but these were only allowed in at noon . One clay we learned that a very important speech by Churchill would be broadcast the following day at 8:00 A. sr . The next morning Father Eugene burst into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill said ? " he roared . " He said our bombers over Germany are so numerous that a perpetual twilight has fallen on that ill-fated country . He said that even if Germany were a mountain range of granite the size of the Himalayas she would be pulverized by the Allied Air Force ! " We were all affected , but I felt a little uncomfortable . The words , even in Greek , had a Churchillian ring . But somehow they sounded too boastful , almost childish . Then in the silence the drawling , sneering voice of the prefect asked , " Reverend Father , is it by your magic powers that you can know what Churchill said before he has actually said it ? " He looked ostentatiously at his wrist watch . " It still lacks a few minutes to eight o'clock , you know . " Father Eugene slowly pulled out his large old-fashioned pocket watch . I looked over his shoulder and saw that it was pointing to twenty past eight , but the second hand was motionless . It must have stopped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to his ear . The color rose to his face . He tried to smile , gave it up , and went out , softly closing the door behind him , as if he were leaving a sick room . From that day on it became a kind of sport to try and catch him out . But I can not think of another instance when we got the better of him . I remember once he was telling us about his visit to Mount Ararat where , he said , he had found the remains of the Ark jammed in a crevice on the highest peak . He described in detail the colossal hulk , gave us heights andwidths and weights with such precise assurance that we began almost to believe him . Then one of us who was an engineer and a Cambridge graduate spoke up . " How large were the nails ? " he asked . Father Eugene did not hesitate a moment , only his voice became more confidential . " Ala yes , I forgot to tell you about that , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous wooden pegs , perfectly fitted . Not a single nail anywhere because as you know , boys , as even a man from Cambridge ought to know . they had not invented iron at the time of the flood . " His worst test was with the obscene movies . The prefect had a deal with the Italian Commandant whereby he was allowed to show movies in the prison , The arrangement was that the Commandant would get the movies first in order to " censor " them . Apparently these censoring sessions were quite some parties , to which the friends of the Commandant and their floozies were invited . The main attraction was some dirty movies which the prefect had in his collection . Father Eugene enjoyed movies but always refused to watch the dirty ones . The prefect decided to play a trick on him . It was announced that a good patriotic movie would be shown . I did not realize what was up until I was jammed next to Father Eugene in the back of the room watching what seemed to be the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ear that the reels had been changed and an obscene one had been tacked on . A few minutes later , without warning , an enormous bare behind supplanted Nathan Hale . There was a roar of applause from the onlookers . Father Eugene gave a little gasp but made no move to leave . He just put his head down and did not lift it once for nearly two hours . I know . ? I was watching him all the time , wondering whether I could possibly have done it myself . When the lights went on and the prefect slapped him on the back and asked him how he had liked the picture , Father Eugene did not even tell him that he had not seen it . At about this time events started moving fast , both for the world and for us in prison , The campaign in North Africa was won . I and two of my friends on the other hand were tried , found guilty , and condemned to death for espionage . We were given a farewell dinner by our friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were handcuffed and chained for the journey to Averoff , the vast and impregnable criminal prison of Athens , there to await execution or commutation of sentence to life imprisonment . As we were standing in the central cage waiting for the guards to lead us off , Father Eugene passed his hand through the bars and patted my arm with unexpected diffidence . " Keep a place warm for me where you are going , " he mumbled and stalked off to hide his embarrassment . It was the first time he had eve ' given a hint of what he thought was in store for him . I wondered to which particular destination he was referringAveroff prison or the other place . IT WAS , I believe , on the tenth of August , in the courtyard of Averoff , that I saw Father Eugene again . I recognized him among the stream of ordinary prisoners crossing in front of the special enclosure for those sentenced to death . He came toward me waving and smiling , and to my amazement the guards did not stop him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both cheeks , and wished me many happy returns of the day . " This is a great day , " he said . " I have permission from the Commandant to say Mass in the courtyard . May the Virgin vouchsafe us a miracle , " he added , using the time-honored expression . " On what occasion , Father ? " I asked . " A great day , my boy , a day of great rejoicing . Our Lady is rising up to Heaven , " he said and winked knowingly. 1 was completely mystified . The feast of the Assumption of the Virgin was still five days off . But you do n't ask the same question twice in prison , and in any case Eugene was on his way . Before he reached the gate he turned back and called , " Do n't miss it . Try to be there ! " As it turned out there was no difficulty . Our Italian guards were curious to sec a Greek Orthodox Mass and we condemned men were escorted into the main courtyard in great style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make his announcements was a. table covered with a white tablecloth , and on it two candlesticks , a cross , a chalice , and a Bible . Behind stood Father Eugene , in gold-embroidered robes . Where he got them God knows . On either side of him was an acolyte swinging a censer . When we arrived the service had just started . The sonorous words poured forth in the ancient nasal singsong . Statement was followed by response , the wine was blessed , the Lord 's prayer was recited , a hymn was sung . I am not a regular churchgoer , but I knew by heart the words of that hymn . Every Greek does . It is perhaps the most celebrated piece of Byzantine music ever written , composed early in the seventh century when Constantinople was delivered front the besieging horde of savages ? the Avars . Father Eugene 's voice swelled and thundered over the ponderous notes , and gradually a few prisoners joined in . But before the singing could become general something happened . It took a while for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' minds made their voices falter and fall silent , till only Father Eugene 's rolling baritone remained . He was singing the ancient hymn accurately and with great feeling , but the words were not the ones we knew , at least not all of them . Sandwiched between the phrases in praise of the Holy Virgin was that day 's news ? and what news it was for usl The Allies had landed on the mainland of Italy , Mussolini had been . ousted from power and placed under arrest in a mountain hide-out , and Marshal Badoglio- had formed a government which would negotiate with the Allied command . I felt like dancing and cheering and embracing my neighbors. 1 even turned toward the man beside me , ready to pound his back , only to find it was the guard . . And then it struck me like a blast of icy wind how dangerous the situation was , especially for the lone figure on the platform above us singing so lustily . The Italians were looking somewhat puzzled by the way the singing had died down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where in Heaven 's name had Father Eugene heard it , and what devil had prompted him to pass it on to us in this most perilous fashion ? The affair of the Churchill speech flitted across my mind and I had a moment of chilling doubt , but I discarded it . Not even Father Eugene would play such a trick on the entire prison . As to why he had chosen this way to tell us , I knew in an instant by looking at the faces of my fellow prisoners . Every one of them had a rapt look as if he were actually seeing the Virgin Mary rising up to Heaven before his eyes . I do n't know whether Eugene was entitled to say Mass , whether he was actually ordained or not . But standing in that prison courtyard with the machine guns trained on us and the armed guards looking foolish and the prisoners looking blissful , I did n't care . It was spine-tingling . It was funny . It was absolutely glorious . A month later the Italians collapsed and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison 1 and a few others managed to escape . I lost touch with Father Eugene corn-plctcly. jUST after the liberation I was sitting in the office of a British Major in the intelligence in Athens , straightening out my affairs . The telephone rang , the Major listened for a while in strained silence , then shouted , " Tell them to go to hell , " and slammed down the receiver . " It 's about that blasted monk again , " he said , turning to me . " What monk ? " I inquired . " A certain Father Eugene who 's caused us more trouble than all the German agents put together . " " Father Eugene ? " I cried . " Was n't he in prison here during the occupation ? " " Yes , he was in prison , " said the Major . " Why ? Did you know him ? " " If it 's the same man , " I said . " What has he been op to now ? " The Major rummaged among his papers , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and handed it to inc . It looked like an ordinary identity card . When opened it , I saw that it was in fact an identity card , but a most extraordinary one . On one side was a passport photograph of a man , obviously a Greek . At the top of the other side were the words " INTELLIGENCE SERVICE " in beautifully embossed capitals , and underneath a statement to the effect that the bearer , Mr. So and So , was a member of the intelligence service in good . standing . There was a signature scrawled at the bottom and a seal which at first sight looked like the British lion and unicorn . There was even a special number allotted to the bearer . " I did n't know you issued these things to your people , " I said . " Do n't be an ass , " snapped the Major . " Of course we do n't . Whoever heard of the intelligence service being called the intelligence service . Look at the signature . " The signature was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Eugene 's surname . Then I noticed that the seal was wrong . Instead of the lion being on the left and the unicorn on the right , they were the other way round and the motto was completely illegible . No one could say that Eugene had misappropriated the symbols of the British Empire . " Do you know that there are thousands of those things floating about ? " demanded the Major . " Do you know that anyone caught with one of them a few mouths ago might have been shot as a spy ? Do you know that every single person who had one of those absurd , worthless little cards thinks he is a hero , that they produce them to prove that they did their bit , and that at least a dozen times a day I get requests from them for jobs on our own intelligence set-up ? " " What did they actually do during the occupation ? " I asked . " Nothing . " " What do you mean , nothing ? What was the whole thing for ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The word was passed to all of them that they would be called upon to undertake an assignment , but the call never came . All your precious monk had to do was start the thing and then sit back and watch it spread . Each man . recruited someone else and knew only the man who had approached him and the one he had recruited himself . The identity cards were passed from hand to hand down the chain . " I started to get a glimmering of what it was all about . These people had wanted to do something for their country . Father Eugene had provided the means . The simple danger of having the cards had made them men who , in their hearts at least , were still resisting the enemy . What difference did it make if nothing came of it ? It seemed to me that heroism should not be measured entirely by its results , and I began to disagree with the Major that the cards worthless . " Did Father Eugene get anything out of it ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make out ? except his comeuppance . " " Being put in jail , you mean ? " " Getting himself shot , I mean . " I realized that I had suspected it all along but had n't wanted to face it . " Why ? " I asked . " What the devil do you mean , ' Why ? ' " the Major exploded . " The man wrought havoc in intelligence operations in damn near the whole Middle East Theater . The counterespionage services of three armies were in an uproar . Everything was in such confusion that regular intelligence work became almost impossible . I shudder to think what those poor Ities went through trying to fight their way out of the mess , " and for the first time the shadow of a smile flitted across his face . " Think of it , man , they actually arrested some two hundred people and could find out absolutely nothing because there was nothing to find out , and had to release them again . None of these chaps had ever seen or heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our people . Father Eugene of course did n't let on . I have his Italian file here and it seems that at all his interrogations he insisted that he had nothing to do with the identity cards , that the fact that they were signed in his name was either coincidence or fraud . Of course the Ities did n't believe it . They had your precious Father Eugene in jail for a year before they made up their minds it was all a hoax . They only gave him a life sentence to save their face . " Now I knew why Father Eugene had never revealed his surname , never spoken of his immediate past , why , after almost a year in prison , no one came to see him , and why , in spite of his friendliness and camaraderie , he had always remained such a solitary , lonely figure . He had perpetrated the most gigantic hoax , but he hadnot endangered anyone else . You could call him the poor man 's insurrectionist or a phony Scarlet Pimpernel if you liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How he must have laughed behind those bushy whiskers of his to watch the mess he had stirred up . I do n't know , I suppose no one will ever know , whether that is what he set out to do . Perhaps it was his own peculiar way of doing his duty as a monk in times of trial . But whatever it was it took courage and a little bit of madness ? or genius . " But why was he shot ? " I asked . " Well , when the Jerries took over the prison they found Father Eugene 's file . But Jerry , as you ought to know , has never had much of a sense of humor . He took the whole thing in deadly earnest . Saw spies in hundreds under every bed and came down like a ton of bricks . The first , and I must admit only , man to get it in the neck was your monk friend . They took him out and shot him about a fortnight before they got out of this place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Major 's voice , but he added gruffly , " By God , if they had n't , I swear we would have had to do it ourselves . "
