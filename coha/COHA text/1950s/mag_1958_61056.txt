Once again Detroit 's molting season is upon us . The plumage which looked so bright a year ago has been shed , and slicked-up new models are on the wheel from Ypsilanti to ybor City and points east and west . Citizens who like to vocalize about the mass and glitter of Detroit automobiles are serenading each other again , but in fact the new cars seem to be headed for a very good year , after a frankly painful one . // Two years ago , at the beginning of the accelerated trend to flatter , longer and wider cars , an adman for one of the Big Three saluted his machine with this bit of doggerel : // O , sweet Chariot , swung low , You 're a dream car come true . There 's no car in your field That is longer than you . // A rival adman ran this slogan up the flagpole : " It 's got git . " // Taken together , these rhapsodies reflected pretty accurately what Detroit had divined the majority wanted in a car : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following pages show , Detroit ( with some modest exceptions ) still feels that way about size . And if the horsepower race has ended , it has done so at a point at which nearly all the cars have as much git as anybody wants . // The new cars from the Big Three , then , are strikingly long , low , wide and flossy . There is said to be a less obtrusive use of chrome and other bright metal trim , although this is not immediately discernible in all models . The market for smaller cars  --  usually called " compact " cars these days to distinguish them from foreign economy cars  --  has again been left to American Motors and Studebaker-Packard. // Once more the stylist is king , and this year Detroit 's weightiest stylist , Harley Earl of General Motors  --  a man who likes to obsolete ' em fustest with the mostest  --  is sending out the cars with the most radical changes . Earl , a tall , richly tailored man , as neatly upholstered as any of his wheeled creations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's carriage shop , and has in recent years given GM cars a look of weighty solidity . // For 1959 Earl has okayed a notably racy line , sharply different in character ( except for the Cadillac ) from what we have come to expect . Chevrolets , Pontiacs , Oldsmobiles and Buicks have almost no resemblance to the 1958 models . His Buick , by the way , was an immediate hit , with production running behind orders . Sobersided styling at Chevrolet has given way to a surprisingly extreme shape ( see page 68 ) , a further affirmation of the big swing away from plain-Jane bodies in the lower price ranges . // CRISP TALK AT FORD // George Walker , the man who handles art at Ford , is a flamboyant , thick-chested ex-pro football halfback who loves to talk about the crispness of his models . His 1957 Ford was a sales champion , but the ' 58 did n't have as much snap , crackle and pop . The 1959 is a cleaner , smarter car ( see opposite page ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mercurys , Edsels and Lincolns have not been introduced yet , but you can expect the biggest change from Mercury , the least from Lincoln . // Over at Chrysler , the prematurely white-haired Virgil Exner , a onetime GM stylist , has put his seal on another set of racily finned models . These will round out the three-year cycle begun so sensationally with the 1957s . The year 1958 saw very little change , but the new cars are noticeably different in detail while still faithful to the original concept . // American Motors and Studebaker-Packard are banking on the recently developed American taste , in some circles , for less size and more economy . AM 's Ramblers were a rousing success in the recession year just past . This year the high tail fins are a bit different , and AM is taking its small 1955 station wagon out of mothballs to join the Rambler American sedan , de-mothballed last year . S-P will try to get out of the financial shallows with a new compact car , the Lark . // What 's this about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ford have spent about $500 million on development and can go into production on relatively short notice ( Ford with a six-cylinder , front-mounted engine ; GM with perhaps an aluminum rear engine ) . For the time being Chrysler will let its French Simca be its small car ( both GM and Ford , of course , also import their own foreign-built cars ) . GM and Ford will wait until they are absolutely convinced the market is there before taking the plunge . Each company feels that it would have to sell upwards of 300,000 models to make such a venture worthwhile ; meanwhile , they want to see how the bread-and-butter ' 59s are going to sell . There are a lot of ifs here , but informed Detroiters expect to see the new compact cars in production before the end of 1959. // Despite the annual hubbub over size and power , there is every reason to believe that Detroit will go right along putting most of its eggs in the long , low , wide basket . The 1960s will be every bit as hefty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the small-car market becomes big , Detroit will cater to it eagerly , but until then ... well , turn the pages . // PONTIAC Like the Chevrolet ( page 68 ) and the other GM cars except Cadillac , the Pontiac has a radically new body . Up to nine inches longer , three inches wider and three inches lower than the 1958s , it comes in three series , with engines of 215 to 345 hp available . The Chevrolet is slightly larger than last year 's , with headlights lowered seven inches . A new six-cylinder economy engine complements the V-8 line . Delray name goes out . // BUICK The old model names are out , including Roadmaster , that famous symbol of material success . To point up the newness of the ' 59s , Buick now introduces these names : LeSabre , Invicta and Electra ( Dynaflow , however , is still Dynaflow ) . Wildcat is the perhaps inevitable name of a new 401-cubic-inch engine , added to the current 364-inch V-8 . Cadillac restyling ( page 69 ) , while not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fins . // STUDEBAKER This is the Lark , the " compact " car with which Studebaker-Packard hopes to get back on its feet in the auto industry . Shown here at the Paris Auto Show , it will not be introduced in the U.S. until next month . Sedans will be 175 inches long , station wagons 184 inches . Two engines will be available , an economical six and a V-8 . S-P says it already has a whopping 25,000 orders . The famous Packard line has been discontinued . // OLDSMOBILE Lower-priced models are 10 inches longer , the " 98 " series six inches longer ; all are slightly wider and lower  --  and cleaner than the chrome-hung 1958s . There is more glass area , as throughout the GM line , and an unusual headlight treatment . Better economy is claimed for the big V-8 engines , of 270 and 315 hp , through refinements to carburetion , choking and transmission systems . Brake drums are flanged to limit fading . // CORVETTE Unique among Detroit cars , the Corvette is a dual-purpose racing-touring sports two-seater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is retained . The addition of radius rods to the rear suspension is expected to improve the handling qualities of an already nimble car . Brake cooling is improved , and engine options from 230 to 290 hp are offered . Transmission systems include a four-speed gearbox for sports car purists . // RAMBLER Having produced nearly 175,000 cars in the 1958 model year , double the previous year 's production , American Motors offers more of the same . The four-year-old short-wheelbase station wagon is revived to join the Cross Country wagon ( above ) . There are minor styling changes in the regular Rambler lines as AM girds for a bigger changeover for 1960 . Unitized body-frames dipped in rust preventer are again a salutary feature . // DODGE Dodge shares with all the Chrysler Corporation models the torsion springing , which gives exceptional handling qualities , and the new optional swivel seats , which permit easier front-door entry . Moderate restyling includes a lower roofline . A six-cylinder engine develops 135 hp , the V-8s up to 345 hp . The most noticeable difference in Plymouth styling ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fin treatment and the indented front fenders. // CHRYSLER Cushiony tires with only 16 pounds of air pressure and a non-glare rearview mirror which snaps to " dim " automatically when a following car 's headlights strike it are new , optional features augmenting the styling face-lift . Lightweight engines produce 305 to 380 hp . The Imperial ( page 70 ) , most expensive and least changed of the Chrysler lines , is roomier and has a stronger frame . A stainless-steel roof joins conventional tops . // MERCURY An enormous compound-curve windshield with 61% more glass area than last year is the most striking feature of the ' 59s . In some models the rear window also wraps up into the roof . Mercury officials say the new cars will be " totally new , from road to roof , " with the instrument panel moved forward six inches to increase knee room , and the wheelbase lengthened as much as four inches . The drive-shaft hump will be considerably smaller . // DE SOTO Here , too , the dimensional change is chiefly in the lowered roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrysler Corporation lines . A new , optional rear air-suspension system is available in all Chrysler models , and pushbutton temperature controls are added to the well-established pushbutton transmission controls . Chrysler 's overlapping engine series gives De Soto a 290- to 350-hp range . // LINCOLN and CONTINENTAL Like Mercurys and Edsels , they wo n't be on the road until next month . Following the big changeover last year , which made them the longest cars on the road , the look of the ' 59s will be only slightly different , as in the grille treatment above . Two new Continental models are added , a town car and limousine . Ford Motors ' other luxury line , the Thunderbird ( page 67 ) , was a hit as a four-seater this year and is changed only in minor details . // EDSEL Introduced last September , the Edsel entered a declining medium-price market in a recession year , but still nearly 60,000 were sold . Edsels are face-lifted for ' 59 and priced nearer the Fords , while Mercury is upgraded . Ford 's Fairlane 500s ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six inches longer . Ford engines develop 145 to 300 hp . A crash program will put a stylish new Ford , the Galaxy , to cost about $3,000 , in showrooms soon .
