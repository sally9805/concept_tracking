Seeking the G.O.P. nomination for an unprecedented third term as governor , Utah 's bumptious J. Bracken Lee was unexpectedly-and unceremoniously-trounced in last week 's bitter Republican primary . So weary were Utah 's Republicans of Lee that they chose instead-by a vote of 62,294 to 54,282-a newcomer to politics , egg-bald George Dewey Clyde , 58 , whose only political recommendation was that , as commissioner of the Utah Water and Power Board , he campaigned hard and successfully for passage of the popular Upper Colorado River bill ( TIME , Feb. 12 et ante ) . <P> Chief architect of Lee 's defeat was Utah 's senior Senator , Arthur V. Watkins , who has feuded with Maverick Lee because of the latter 's zany antics in opposing aid for public education , the federal income tax , and the Eisenhower Administration . Watkins denounced Lee as " the most disruptive influence in the whole Republican Party .
