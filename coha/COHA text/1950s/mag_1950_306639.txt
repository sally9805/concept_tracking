In the current issue of the intellectual , small-circulation BBC Quarterly , British readers got an educator 's low-down on a big , unmannerly U.S. industry . In an article called " The State of American Radio , " Chancellor Robert M. Hutchins of the University of Chicago told the British , whose radio is noncommercial , how the U.S. system works : " The advertiser must sell goods to stay in business . The network and station manager must sell time to stay in business . The advertising agency must present programs that sell goods to stay in business . All these people have managed to stay in business , but American radio is a disgrace . " <P> Television , which " has adversely affected conversation , reading and the public taste , " will complete the ruin , thinks Hutchins . " The one good thing that radio has given America is a great deal of fine music . This seems fated to diminish as television spreads . " <P> But what chiefly upset Educator Hutchins was a radioman 's suggestion that the low U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fault of educators . Wrote Hutchins : " Even a perfect educational system would have a hard time setting up an effective cultural opposition to the storm of trash and propaganda that now beats upon the American from birth . . . Comic books and Betty Grable , the Lone Ranger and Milton Berle are the diet of our children . " The only hope , Hutchins thinks , is subscription radio or heavily endowed university networks-neither of which seems likely . His gloomy conclusion : " We can expect no improvement until the day the American people rise up and hurl their radio sets into the streets . But that day will probably never come ; we have got so we need the noise . "
