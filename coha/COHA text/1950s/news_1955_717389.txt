txt France is going through a profound crisis which deserves all the sympathy and understanding that she can get from her friends in America . One is not speaking here of agreement or of refraining from criticism  --  neither of which is a concomitant of friendship . ? The appalling mishandling of the Moroccan affair is as obvious to many Frenchmen as it is to outsiders , and this is the crux of Premier Faure 's immediate troubles . He dismissed four of his Gaullist Ministers yesterday , but they were set to resign anyway . The split in the Cabinet was apparent a long time ago and M. Faure can be accused of inexcusable weakness in allowing the situation to reach the present stage . He is in the classic position at the moment of having sat down between two stools , as ' Rabelais would have said . In a situation that required firm action he dithered , and so has earned the enmity of those who favored a conciliatory policy and of those who favored a firm , authoritarian policy . This was all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sultan , create a regency council , form a new Moroccan Government and give it more autonomy . His one hope was to press forward with this policy , but he failed to do so . That is why Morocco is now in revolt , why there has been no solution and why the Gaullist Ministers are out of the Government . The Algerian problem , which is even more serious in its way , because Algeria means more to France , was not M. Faure 's fault . A lot of past sins and failures are coming to roost , but France did not deserve this present crisis in Algerian affairs nor did she deserve the adverse vote in the United Nations General Assembly that has resulted in her withdrawal . It is a fact that the " assimilation " of Algerians into the French Union has lagged , but it is also a fact that France has a consistent and laudable policy in0 Algeria which deserves a peaceful evolution . Here again , if the peren-1 nial weakness of the metropolitan Governments in Paris continues , the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of France 's troubles since the war and , unfortunately , it can be demonstkated  --  as Herbert Luethy , the Swiss journalist , shows in a recent book called " France Against Herself " ? it is a weakness that goes back generations , if not centuries . Perhaps it is endemic in the French character not to permit strong Governments except on rare and unfortunate occasions when a Napoleon comes along . If so , France has been enjoying a luxury that the present state of world tension , especially in the colonial field , will not allow . The internal situation has its difficulties which at the moment are shown most clearly in the serious rail , metallurgical and dock strikes . The economy has been improving and it is fairly strong , on the whole . France was happily endowed by nature and history with a rich soil , a vast body of highly skilled workers and a race as intelligent and civilized as any in the world . What she has lacked is a political stability and those civic virtues which give I solidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whom we inherit it . One asks so frequently where all this is leading and how long the French body politic can stand it that the question seems to answer itself . Somehow France goes on ; somehow the French people adjust themselves to weakness and instability ; somehow they manage to derive a certain consistency and durability out of the inconsistencies . The more things change , the more they remain the same . There is evidently a method in their madness , although it is hard for outsiders to explain or understand . And there stands France today , on the threshold of what seems like a certain political crisis . Even if M. Faure barely scrapes through a vote of confidence in the National Assembly because the foreign ministers ' conference is coming on Oct. 27 , the crisis will only have been briefly postponed . According to the political game as it is played in France , Edgar Faure is on the way out . The counsel for those of us who are sitting back anxiously is patience  --  a lot of patience . France 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends in the United States must try to make them as short and as easy as possible .
