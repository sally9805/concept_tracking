IN New Zealand 's rugged Fiordland a bird thought extinct for fifty years is struggling for survival . Behind the rare species in its fight for life is all the protective power of the Dominion Government . Rediscovery of this flightless bird , the large , brilliant-hued native rail which the Maoris called takahea , meaning " wandering at large , " excited almost as much interest in New Zealand as discovery of a living passenger pigeon would arouse in America . To zoologists and bird lovers throughout the world , reappearance of takahea , now called the takahe , was a notable event . They had a scientific name for the creature ? Notornis hochstetteri , the first half of which means bird of the south "  - -  but they knew tantalizingly little about it and had considered it lost in the limbo of vanished species . To the rediscoverer , Dr. G. B. Orbell. a physician of Invercargill , New Zealand , the dramatic sight of a takahe alive came as the reward of years of patient and systematic search . Only four of the birds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore of a lake in what is now called Notornis Valley ( map , page 394 ) . Since August , 1898 , there had been no authentic report of one being caught , or even seen . Futile Wings Have Three-foot Span A primitive type of large moor hen found only in New Zealand , the takahe is unlike any other member of the world-wide rail family to which it belongs . For example , despite its membership in an aquatic family , it avoids swamps and rivers . It does , however , share some of the clan 's characteristics , such as a large frontal shield ( page 396 ) . The full-grown takahe stands some twenty inches high and weighs about six pounds . The wings , though incapable of flight , may have a three-foot span . The adult bird is vividly colored . Head , neck , breast , and flanks are an iridescent indigo blue , becoming brighter on the shoulders and changing to a malachite green on the mantle . The dark rump and upper tail coverts are olive green , the abdomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . The powerful beak is scarlet at the base , fading outwards to a wax pink . Legs and feet are red , eyes reddish brown . This brilliant color scheme is seen to full advantage only when the bird is approaching the observer or passing at right angles to him . In contrast to its showy parents , the young takahe wears only a uniform , soft black down ( page 395 ) . The black beak is white-tipped , and the disproportionately large legs are a pale purple . In New Zealand 's ornithological history , extinction , or near extinction , has been the lot of many species ' as a result of settlement . Originally , native birds had no enemies , and the vegetation which affords them cover was not subject to browsing by animals . Under these favorable conditions many unusual forms of life , including birds of little or no power of flight , were able to survive and thrive . Vanished Birds Include 12-foot Moa Before the arrival of Capt . James Cook in 1769 , birds were the dominant land vertebrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polynesian rat , and two species of bats . The dog and rat had been introduced by the Maoris on their second migration , about A. D. 1150 . After the Maoris had caused the extinction of the huge flightless moa , one species of which was twelve feet high , European settlement brought about more extensive changes . Ferrets , stoats , and weasels were introduced to control a plague of rabbits , and these , with cats , dogs , and other predators , virtually sealed the fate of numerous native species , among them the takahe . The first living takahe known to Europeans was purposely killed and eaten . It was caught by a sealing gang on Resolution Island , near the southwest end of South Island , in 1849 . Two years later a party of Maoris caught a second bird in Thompson Sound , about forty miles farther north . Luckily , the skins of both birds were obtained by Mr. W. D. B. Mantell , who in 1847 had discovered the semifossil remains of the North Island variety ( duly named Notornis mantelli by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sent to the British Museum . Twenty-eight years passed before another specimen appeared . A rabbiter 's dog caught it near the south end of Lake Te Anau . The bird was destined for the cooking pot when  | it was rescued by a farm manager and eventually sold to a museum in Dresden , Germany , for ? 105 . After close examination , Dr. Adolph B. Meyer of the Dresden museum found that this bird was sufficiently different from the North Island semifossil form found by Mantell to warrant a distinct name . Accordingly , the name Notornis hochstettcri was given the present species . The fourth specimen was caught by a dog on the shore of Middle Fiord of Lake Te Anau in 1898 . The bird was bought by the Government for ? 250 to ensure that it remained in New Zealand . Preserved in the Otago Museum at Dunedin , it still is the only mounted specimen in the country , for no more takahe were known until Dr. Orbell 's discovery . A Thirty-year Quest Begins Dr. Orbell 's interest in the creature began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he found an old photograph showing the museum bird in a case . His mother told its story and explained that the bird was supposed to be extinct . That word " supposed " stimulated Dr. Orbell 's adventurous spirit , and he learned all he could about the species . From game rangers and from men who had probed the fastnesses of Fiordland , from hearsay and from stories told around campfires on numerous hunting trips , Dr. Orbell picked up fragments of information about possible takahe hiding places . In 1945 Dr. Orbell built a summer home at Lake Te Anau , where two of the birds had been caught . The question of the takahe 's existence and whereabouts was always with him , but he seldom mentioned the matter except jokingly or as a bait to catch information . In this way he learned that a man who knew the country round about always carried his rifle loaded when in a certain area . " It might be worth ? 400 to ? 500 , " the man said with a knowing air . By plotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his summer home , Dr. Orbell found that the area surrounded by reported sightings of the takahe was one of the least explored in the country . In each case the bird was claimed to have been seen on  | beaches below the bushline in winters with heavy snowfalls . Dr. Orbell also heard of a lake , seen from the air , that was unmarked on his maps . Maori history suggested its existence and whereabouts . Kohaka-takahea , " nesting place of the wanderer , " the Maoris called the lake . Maori tradition also held that the bird once was plentiful in certain areas , particularly along the shores of Lakes Manapouri and Te Anau , both large glacial lakes on the eastern fringe of the heavily forested and mountainous Fiordland. * The natives , so the story went , had made annual drives to capture the birds for food when the snows of winter drove the takahe from the mountains . It was in April , 1948 , that Dr. Orbell and two friends first made their way into the promising area . Reaching a ridgetop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipice . Far below a lake glistened in the sunlight . Beyond the lake a valley extended for several miles , deep among the peaks . Notes Heard , Footprints Found There was little time to spend in the valley before turning back to camp , but it was long enough for Dr. Orbell to hear an unknown birdcall ? two long , deep notes repeated twice ? and to see large prints at the lower end of  | the lake where he stopped to quench his thirst . With careful measurements of the prints ( scratched on the stem of Dr. Orbell 's pipe ! ) the party returned home . They referred the evidence to noted New Zealand ornithologists , but the experts could not agree . Dr. R. A. Falla , Director of the Dominion Museum , who later led a number of expeditions to study the bird , thought it might be that of a takahe ; another expert considered it the print of a white heron . On November 20 of the same year the party again entered the valley , armed with cameras and 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult route led up terraced limestone slopes and through dense beech forests twined with brambles . Ferns , roots , and moss-covered rotting tree trunks gave uncertain footing . Not 20 yards from where the tracks were seen the April before , the doctor again saw prints , so fresh that the sand still moved at their rims ? and then the first takahe ! Seconds later , as Orbell 's movie camera whirred , another bird , no more disturbed than a farmyard hen , moved into focus 20 yards away . Quickly the net was drawn about the birds . The elusive takahe had been caught at last . The party carefully carried the birds , a male and a female , to the lake shore and tethered them to stakes thrust in the sand . After study and more picture taking , the takahe were released to allow them to return to their nest in the tall grass . A third bird ran off toward the bush , but remained in full view , feeding and squawking , for an hour . Since 1948 six expeditions have bushwhacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other investigators working under the aegis of the Department of Internal Affairs . New colonies have been discovered in adjacent areas ; the next valley south of Notornis Valley shelters a small population of the birds . Much has been learned about the takahe , and conservation methods have been studied . So far as is known , the takahe is restricted to the rugged Murchison Mountains west of Lake Te Anau ( page 398 ) . The main colony survives in a hanging valley with an altitude of 3,000 feet , rising at the head to 4,000 feet . From fossil and semifossil remains , it is known that the South Island notornis once ranged throughout the northeast , south , and southeast of the island , and it is interesting to note that in each case the remains were found in low country . As the bird knew no  | enemy before the arrival of the Maoris and Europeans , settlement probably caused its retreat to mountain heights . The Notornis ( or Takahe ) Valley , as the main valley is called , is only three miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the lower end lies the moraine lake , girt on three sides by tussocks of snow grass ( page 399 ) . Although the adult takahe appears to be mainly herbivorous , the bird 's diet varies somewhat with the seasons . When obtainable , the succulent bases of snow grass and sedges seem to be favored . At times during the four months of winter , when deep snow covers the ground , the birds are forced to move to the forest . There they eke out the available supply of snow grass with the tender parts of shrubs , mosses , and possibly insects . For eight to ten days after hatching , the diet of the chicks includes insects , but by the time they are a month old they appear to be vegetarians . At this age they still have not fully learned the adult method of feeding , but merely pick at tender shoots and leaf bases protruding from the beak of the parent . An Acrobatic Eater The feeding habits of the adult birds are fascinating to watch . By one method , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs its beak along the stems , stripping the seed heads . It may slide off taller tufts , garnering seeds as it drops . To pluck shoots both of Carex ( a sedge ) and snow grass , notornis takes firm hold of the plants near the ground with its beak . A quick pull usually suffices to pluck a sedge shoot . When feeding on snow grass , however , the bird makes a strong upward swing , using the heft of its body as a weight lifter would . Such a fibrous diet causes the bird 's droppings to be easily distinguishable from those of all other birds . This peculiarity , together with the mass of discarded snow grass stems , offers unmistakable evidence of the takahe 's presence , even to the most casual observer . An interesting characteristic of the bird is its sense of property . Each mated pair ranges freely within what appears to be a fairly welldefined feeding territory . The quiet chirps of a contented feeding pair are quickly broken off at the suspected presence of a third . Chirping changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kerlonk " ? which seem to be a combination of alarm and warning to any trespassers . The calls , coming from each bird in turn , rise in tempo for about 30 seconds and stop as suddenly as they begin . Adults summon their chicks with a single repeated note , " cowp-cowp-cowp . " When a pair is separated , one screams " kee-ew , " the other answering with a single " kau . " The takahe flicks its tail up and down with almost every step . It runs swiftly , with a free-and-easy gait like a good trotting horse . The three- to four-month nesting season begins in October ( spring in the Southern Hemisphere ) , when every pair prepares a number of nests , each consisting of a grass bowl with at least two entrances , set between thick snow grass tussocks ( page 396 ) . The last to be made is apparently chosen for actual egg laying , and either one or two cream eggs flecked with light purple and brown spots are laid ( page 397 ) . Within three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incubation seldom movemore than 60 or 70 feet from the nest . Although well camouflaged itself , a nest can easily be located by the heavy feeding signand the mass of droppings near by . Beset by Many Dangers To give the takahe every chance of survival . agents of the Department of Internal Affairs are trapping , shooting , and snaring stoats . weasels , bush hawks , and other predators . Some control of wandering deer that imperil nest ' ? and eggs may be necessary . But other factors ? the infertility of the species , the severity of winters , and the availability of snow grass for feeding and nesting ? seem beyond human control . Bush fires may easily run wild and destroy the birds . which can not fly to safety . The history of the American heath hen is a graphic example of the decline and extinction of a species , with a parallel , perhaps , in the takahe . Once abundant in Massachusetts and probably much more of New England , the heath hen was driven eastward by hunting and after 1870 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From 1890 , when the heath hen population was estimated at 200 , there was a slight decline until 1907 . With sound conservation measures the number increased to about 2,000 by 1916 , but in that year a combination of factors reduced the population to fewer than 150 birds , most of which were males . Again the numbers rose slightly until 1920 , when a steady and inexorable decline set in . By 1928 only one bird could be found ; it was seen for the last time in 1932 . As the case of the heath hen demonstrated , when a species is reduced to a very low number , fertility may fall off sharply . Biologists recognize this fact , although they do not yet fully understand the reasons . At present , estimates of the total number of takahe vary from 30 to 100 , compared to  | about 150 birds in one colony of the American heath hen when the final contraction of that ill-fated species set in . The known remaining takahe form several colonies , the largest of which has only about ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winters Limit Food From observations over three nesting seasons , it seems that most , if not all , of the birds in the main Notornis Valley breed yearly , but very few chicks are hatched and raised . In the 1949-50 season , 40 percent of the observed eggs were totally infertile , only three chicks were hatched , and by February , 1950 , only one remained alive . It is now known , however , that several birds besides those under observation were nesting . The availability of snow grass and other food during severe winters , when the area is deeply covered with snow , is an important factor in the survival of the species . A dead adult bird , untouched by predators , was found in the main valley in the spring of 1949 . This and other complete skeletons have suggested that starvation is a not uncommon cause of death . Every endeavor is being made to preserve these contemporaries of New Zealand 's extinct giant moa , swan , and eagle , interesting creatures sorely missed . But if measures to combat predators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depletion , if a severe winter strikes , or if infertility increases ? if any one or a combination of these mishaps overtakes back-to-the-wall notornis ? then the species must inevitably join the heath hen , the dodo , the great auk , and others that are lost to the world forever .  |
