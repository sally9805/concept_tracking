The New York Yankees-among ball clubs the royalty and far-out winners of the 1958 American League pennant-faced up scornfully one afternoon last week to aging ( 35 ) Hoyt Wilhelm , knuckleball pitcher for the seventh-place Baltimore Orioles and long since cast off by the Giants , - Cardinals and Indians . Wilhelm , who had won only two games all season , thereupon pitched to just 28 batters and shut out the Yanks in a 1-o no-hitter . <P> Off the field the Yanks were also in trouble . Pitcher Ryne Duren and Coach Ralph Houk brawled at a champagne party celebrating the Yanks ' pennant won last week . The squabble was patched up after Duren admitted he had drunk too much , but the management felt obliged to keep a squad of private detectives on the players to make sure they stayed in shape for the World Series . In the ensuing comedy of errors , one gumshoe ( he was actually wearing gum-soled shoes ) shadowed Star Pitcher Bob Turley for three days and discovered Turley seldom drinks anything stronger than soda pop . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit on an innocent quest for popcorn at the Y.M.C.A. <P> But at week 's end , as they learned that Milwaukee 's World Champion Braves had clinched the National League flag again , the Yankees were 7-5 favorites to shake off their miseries and win the series .
