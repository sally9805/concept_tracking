Form : To put it bluntly . . . form is one of the composer 's chief means of averting the boredom of his audience . <P> Organ : The widespread impression amongst a section of the musical public that a unit organ consists of about a dozen vox humanas and a powerful tremulant is based upon observation of the performances of the injudicious . <P> Virtuoso : The reward of the instrumental virtuoso in glory and cash is beyond that of any other honest profession ( except that of the prima donna , q.v . ) . <P> Prima Donna : The word has , in the mouths of the more thinking members of the musical public , taken on a half-humorous , half-caustic meaning . . . ( The child who in an examination paper misspelt the term Prim Madonna was very young ) . <P> So goes one of the most popular one-volume musical reference books ever written : The Oxford Companion to Music . On most of its 1,195 pages may be found other samples of wry humor , homely philosophy and unabashed propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of musical life . Every word is the penchild of a sprightly 78-year-old scholar and popular educator named Percy A. Scholes ( pronounced skoles ) . <P> Born in Leeds of middle-class parents with no interest in music , Scholar Scholes only waited to finish prep school before dedicating himself to life as a musical missionary . In the next years , he taught , lectured with the assistance of a cranky phonograph , compiled the first history of music on records ( the Columbia History of Music ) , then got a job writing running program notes for the margins of player piano rolls so pedal pumpers could read about the music they were hearing as they heard it . <P> With a contract for two piano rolls a week , Scholes and his wife moved to Switzerland , which was kinder to his bronchitis , and settled down to write a compendium for the common , or musically uneducated music lover . The famed Dr. Johnson waggishly defined a lexicographer as " a harmless drudge . " Scholes makes no attempt to refute the gibe , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. , he meticulously checked numberless musical scores rather than reprint other men 's findings , with the " minor " result that he explains and translates " probably a greater number of musical directions than that in any previous publication . " <P> Seven years and 1,000,000 words later , the Companion was done , was published in 1938 . Last week the ninth edition went to press for the second printing-an all-time world record for musical reference works . As for Author Scholes , he sat happily in his house in Oxford , wheezing a bit but looking almost spry enough to take a fling at the Can-Can : " A boisterous and latterly indecorous dance . . . Its exact nature is unknown to anyone connected with this Companion . "
