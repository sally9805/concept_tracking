txt The House of Representatives approved overwhelmingly today a farm bill supported by Ezra Taft Benson , Secretary of Agriculture . The vote assured passage of farm legislation before Congress adjourns . The Senate has already passed a similar bill . The action today was regarded as a great victory for Mr. Benson ? in particular for his drive toward lower price supports on key crops . The " leverage " he used was a provision in existing law that forced a drastic reduction in rice and cotton acreage in the absence of new legislation . Last week Mr. Benson gambled to get a better bill by mustering enough Republican votes to block passage of a bill approved by the House Agriculture Committee . Rayburn Had Balked For a while it appeared the , gamble had lost , because Souse Speaker Sam .

The Agriculture Committee last night approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved the bill , the Republicans rallied round , and the bill went through the House today on a voice vote .

Mr. Rayburn declared the bill passed by the necessary two-thirds majority on the basis of the voice vote . Major Provisions of . Bill The bill 's main provisions are as follows : ( lit ends all acreage eontrols on corn and drops price supports immediately to 65 per cent of parity , or about $1.14 a bushel . Under the House bill , farmers would have to approve this change by referendum . The original bill in the House contained a floor of $1.18 a bushel. int gives individual cotton farmers , for the next two years , a choice between 80 per cent of parity with low acreage or 65 per cent of parity with higher acreage . By 1962 there wilt be a floor of 65 per cent for all cotton , or about 27 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original bill had a floor of 30 cents , and this wasp the heart of Mr. Benson 's ob-1 jection. gradually reduces rice s 2ports to 65 per cent with // allowance of iigher acreage . The present law puts a floor of 75 per cent of parity under all three crops . Parity is a Federal standard aimed at assuring to farmers a fair return on their products in relation to their production costs . The bill did not touch the three other " basic " crops ? wheat , peanuts and tobacco . Wheat and peanuts now have support floors of 75 , per cent and tobacco 90 per cent . Mr. Benson will go after them next year , but he may not have the same leverage from the acreage situation that he had this year . Although the bill moves decisively in the direction advocated by Mr. Benson for three important crops , one of its first effects will probably be to increase rather than decrease the huge farm outlays in the budget , now estimated at a total of $6,000,000,000 for the current fiscal year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may lead , in particular , to a glut of corn next year .
