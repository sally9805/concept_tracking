THE COLORS OF THE DAY ( 310 pp. ) - Romaln Gary-Simon &; Schuster ( $3.50 . ) <P> The French expression for love at first sight is un coup de foudre-a crash of thunder . When Jacques Rainier meets Ann Garantier at a carnival in Nice , the crash is shattering . Rainier is a one-armed French intellectual with a two-fisted attitude toward love and war . For 15 years-in Spain , the French air force , the R.A.F. , the Maquis-he has been fighting " to defend a civilization which , from the Virgin Mary , Dante , Petrarch and the Troubadors ... to the humblest of our movies ... has always celebrated the cult of love . " Ann is a Hollywood movie star who seems frigid only because the right man has never come along to thaw her out . The emotional storm they generate is so electric that for two days they barely have time to eat . <P> In The Colors of the Day , French Novelist Remain Gary has written a rhapsody to love that is both lyrical and brilliantly orchestrated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with his common sense , and in overstating his case he undercuts it . But , for all that , he has a way with words , and he tells a long story with enough immediacy and warmth to recall the salad days to an octogenarian . <P> Man 's Oldest Profession . Ann quickly learns that Rainier , an incorrigible idealist , is about to ship for Korea to fight Communism , and that she has a redoubtable rival : " l'humanit ... the last femme fatale . " For though her lover bursts with poetic talk about keeping her happy , he is committed to " man 's oldest profession , which is to be forever reaching for some distant goal of Justice and Liberty . " <P> <P> In short , as Author Gary acknowledges by quoting it , his hero is afflicted with the old Cavalier conviction : " I could not love thee , Dear , so much , Loved I not Honor more . " Explicitly , his duty is to keep making the world safe for the kind of love he lives for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such duties . " Oh you statesmen of bad breath ! " he declaims . " How dare you spend hours in your councils listening to anything that is not a sound of a lover 's kiss ? " <P> Amorous Defense . Author Gary does not waste much sympathy on Ann 's husband , Willie Bauch , who is having hives , hay fever and asthma at the thought of having lost her to Rainier . Willie is a Hollywood " universal genius " and triple-decker phony , not quite real enough to be Apathetic . Willie finally hires a killer to get rid of Rainier . But the killer is killed himself , and Rainier goes to Korea , leaving Ann desolate but able to understand a bit of the old Cavalier compulsion . <P> Novelist Gary , who is also a professional French diplomat at the United Nations , has succeeded fairly well in portraying that complicated rarity , the intellectual cavalier . Also , no doubt of it , he has turned out one of the most amorous defenses of democracy in a long time .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
