On NBC 's Meet the Press last week , Nationalist China 's Madame Chiang Kai-shek asserted : " All over China they are crying out right now for the return of the Nationalist government . " The Generalissimo himself has never ceased to insist that one day he will go back , although he has adjusted his thinking to changing circumstances . <P> For the first five or six years after the retreat to Formosa , the Generalissimo regularly spoke of reconquering the mainland " next year . " Today it has become " soon " or " when the time is ripe . " Aware of U.S. fears that a Nationalist attack on the mainland might lead to World War III , Chiang has also come to emphasize that " there is no need for a world war or for the U.S. to participate , directly . " <P> Chiang is under no illusion that he can reoccupy mainland China by sheer force of Nationalist arms . What he is waiting and hoping for is a fullscale , Hungarian-style uprising . He wants to be ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says he : " The Hungarian type of revolt is not only possible in the future , it has been happening increasingly in Sinkiang , Tibet , Chinhai and on the borders of Yunnan and Szechwan . . . The time will come for a national revolution against Communism . " <P> Chiang 's statements have a basis in fact . The Communists themselves have broadcast evidence of restiveness-although so far they have always been able to control it . Last January Lo Jui-ching , chief of Red China 's secret police , casually admitted that in the preceding two years his men had found it necessary to investigate 18 million workers for " counterrevolutionary thoughts , " had smashed 3,000 " revolutionary cliques " and uncovered 100,000 active **29;12051;TOOLONG of them in the Communist Party itself . <P> No plebiscite has ever been held in Red China on the issue of Chiang Kaishek , and none ever will be . But there have been two occasions when Chinese were offered a free choice : <P> In Korea , offered the option , 14,000 Chinese prisoners of war ( out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families in Red China , chose Formosa instead . When the Nationalists evacuated the Tachen Islands off the coast of Chekiang province in 1955 , the islands ' civilian populace was given the choice of evacuation to Formosa or acceptance of Communist rule . Of the islands ' 18,500 inhabitants , exactly 19 chose to remain and await the Communist administration . <P> On the two occasions when they have been given a free choice , these ordinary Chinese chose exile in Chiang 's Nationalist China over home in Mao 's New China . On such evidence , Chiang bases his hopes .
