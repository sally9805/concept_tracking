 | The surprising flying squirrel He looks like a kite and flies a glider , and you may have one in your attic RUMMAGING the attic for family tintypes , I became aware that a plastic garment bag hanging from a contained something besides garments . Something inside was moving . I called my daughter Mary Ellen and we took down the bag and started removing the clothes . In the sleeve of a coat there was activity . Taking the coat downstairs we got a cage and took out a flying squirrel , an astonishingbut common creature which most people have never seen . Our captive was about nine inches long , but more than four inches of that was a curious , flattened tail . The squirrel was a drab , grayishbrown color above and had a white belly . Its fur was as soft as that of a chinchilla ; it had small ears and large , shoebutton eyes . Along its sides were lines marking the folded skin which , when spread , enables it to glide and swoop through the night shadows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm . Instead of threshing about , as case of most newly caught animals it huddled in a corner , covering its huge eyes with its tail as though to shield them from the unaccustomed t The next night we liberated thesquirrel , watched it climb a tree and then sail off through the shadows . This incident was typical of the occasions when householders become aware of this gliding creature of the night . Flying squirrels are among most nocturnal of mammals . They may frequent the trees in the yard or even share the house with a family for years without being apprehendded . Most persons are incredulous when informed that they are living in close proximity to flying squirrels . Mrs. Lorraine Rudy of Ottsville , was as sitting in her living room one evening when Pearl , her large gray @# cat , walked in and placed a flying squirrel on the rug . A neighbor of mine tapped a small , dead tree , expecting to see a woodpecker fly out of the small hole near the top . Something flew out , all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped out of the hole and sailed away like a fur-bearing flying saucer . The man had never seen one before . The flying squirrel does n't fly in the strict sense of the word . When it launches out from a tree it extends all four legs spread-eagle fashion and the skin folds tighten between the legs . In this position the animal resembles a furry kite . The tail is used as a rudder , giving the squirrel considerable maneuverability . It can turn quite sharply to avoid limbs and tree trunks . As it reaches the end of its glide it turns upward sharply and lands against a tree . Scampering up the tree , it takes off in another glide . Flying squirrels are reputed to glide up to 150 feet , but usually it is not more than half that . Known to so few , the common flying squirrel , Glaucomys volans , inhabits most of the eastern half of the United States , and larger species live in the North and West . Volans normally builds its nest in a hole in a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The young , from two to six , are born in March or April . In my attic they made a mess of the place by tearing up the nests of wasps and mud daubers to get the grubs inside . Like other squirrels they are hoarders and will store away prodigious quantities of food . Although shy and furtive in the wild , the flying squirrel makes an interesting pet . Miss Lio Hess , a friend whose business is photographing animals , has kept flying squirrels both in the city and in the country . Miss Hess warns against grabbing flying squirrels by the tail . In this connection she had an unnerving experience . She grabbed one by the tail and the tail came right off in her hand . It did n't break off but slipped off the bone like a glove . Miss Hess has n't grabbed one by the tail since . To appreciate the aerial abilities of flying squirrels it is best to watch them at liberty . Some persons have established feeding stations where they watch the little fliers through a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes in them . I found three squirrels living in a nest box put up for flickers . The squirrels are not prone to fly in the daytime but usually poke their heads out of the hole and stare at their visitor . My method is to sit in the gloom of the attic , where the squirrels do n't seem to mind my presence . My wife , however , has expressed the opinion that both I and the squirrels ought to stay out of there . END @#
