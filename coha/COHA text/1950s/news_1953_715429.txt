txt A cow , dead or alive , is worth $110 more in Belgium than in Holland . This is a challenging situation to Belgian butchers , Dutch farmers and just plain citizens on both . sides of the border out to make some easy money . And the efforts of all these people are also a challenge to the frontier guards and customs officials . It all began quite simply . Dutch I farmers killed their cows . Border citizens hid the meat in trucks and drove across the river bridges into Belgium . Belgian butchers bought the meat . The $110 was split three ways . Trucks Inspected Then the customs officers began inspecting all trucks . Every package was opened and prodded . Grain and hay were unloaded and reloaded scoop by scoop . Not a mouthful of illegal meat went across the bridges . Things were bleak until some border citizens remembered there were rows of tanks and armoreji cars in old army dumps . They acquired a fleet , for scrap metal , loaded them with meat , and charged across the barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the meat went thru . Things were bleak in the customs posts . A guard thought of the Molotov cocktail  --  the bottle loaded with gasoline which stopped so many German tanks . Since the border was at peace , he suggested filling the bottles with paint . A direct hit would blind the driver , he said . Stopped By " Bombs " The guards practiced throwing , and when they became expert , they stopped the tanks . It was the border citizens ' turn . They gave up all thought of using bridges and concentrated on the quiet Stretches of the border river . Why not swim the meat across ? Dutch farmers drove their cattle to the river banks . At night , two by two the citizens swam the cows across . Belgian butchers led the animals away . There was one snag . The cows made too much noise . They lowed and , with increasing frequency , guards came running . The cattle had to be abandoned . All became quiet again along the river . At night the animals swam across , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of them . The citizenry had discovered a husky meal of soft soap kept the animals still . What Was Tipoff Then , out of the dark guards descended on the cattle just as they were coming out of the river . In court here today , the puzzled smugglers asked what gave them away . The guards smiled . The soft soap , they . said . The cows blew bubbles . All the guards had to do was stand on the bridges and wait for bubbles to flow past . Then they knew something was up . The smugglers paid their fines and walked out . Just how , they asked one another , do you stop cows from blowing bubbles ? VOCALIZING INHIBITED Robert Bean , director of the Brookfield zoo , said last night that the reason the soap diet kept the cows quiet probably was due to the fact that it produced a sort of synthetic phlegm in the animals ' throats which inhibited their natural impulse to vocalize . The fact that a cow could be induced to devour soap is not unusual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , he said , as long as it is mixed with meal . So all the farmers would have to do , he said , would be to sprinkle soft soap in the evening mash . Bean emphasized , however , that none of the animals in the Brookfield ZOO ever were fed soap .
