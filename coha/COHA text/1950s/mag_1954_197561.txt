( See Cover ) <P> That anchor and pride of Republicanism , the great and prosperous state of Pennsylvania , went Democratic-solidly , surprisingly , and in a way that seemed to shatter the pathetic remnants of its once proud and efficient state G.O.P. organization . <P> In as governor was Democrat George M. Leader , 36 , a young man whom few outside of his home York County had ever heard of until eight months ago . On top of that , the state house of representatives went Democratic 111 to 99 , and the state senate returned a bare Republican majority ( 27-23 ) . Never before-not even when fun-loving George H. Earle rode the tidal crest of the New Deal wave in 1934 - had Democrats come so close to making a clean sweep in Harrisburg . <P> In the congressional elections , the clean sweep stopped : the national pull of Dwight Eisenhower and the local hold of some G.O.P. county organizations was too great . Nevertheless , Pennsylvania will send three additional Democrats to Washington in January , and the Republican majority in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Reasons . What happened ? There were several explanations , none of them adequate , all of them providing slivers of truth . Most pundits and politicos settled on unemployment as the major factor in the Democratic sweep . The U.S. Labor Department lists eight counties in Pennsylvania where unemployment is in the critical range of 10% or more of the working population . Some 377,000 Pennsylvanians are jobless ; 120,000 have exhausted their unemployment compensation ( $30 a week for 26 weeks ) ; uncounted thousands more are what George Leader calls " underemployed , " i.e. , working less than 40 hours a week . A week before Election Day , a riot broke out in Donaldson 's Crossroads , ten miles south of Pittsburgh , when 1,500 men turned out for 40 highway laborers ' jobs . <P> But unemployment was not the only factor in Pennsylvania ; it was not even the deciding factor . In other states ( e.g. , Ohio and Indiana ) , where unemployment is serious , the Republicans held up well . And in Pennsylvania the Democrats would have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed coal areas . <P> A second factor was the unpopularity of Republican Governor John Fine 's administration and a Pandora 's box of contributing local issues . Added to this , the Republicans ran a poor campaign with an unfortunate candidate . Lieutenant Governor Lloyd Wood , a cigar-chomping politician . Wood had to carry all of the liabilities and secured none of the assets of the Republican organization 's 100-year-old reputation . The evil that political machines do lives long after their effectiveness is gone . <P> Another factor was the recent and rapid Democratic upsurge in eastern Pennsylvania . In 1951 the Democrats won the Philadelphia mayoralty , interrupting 67 years of Republican rule at City Hall . In 1952 Adlai Stevenson took the city by 162,000 votes-an election freak that bewildered the experts and bothered the Republican National Committee . It should have jogged the Republicans of Pennsylvania out of their complacency , but it did n't . <P> Finally-and most importantly-the
