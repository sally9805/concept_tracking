The Traveler A Story by Wallace Stegner Drawings by Arthur Shilstone H E WAS rolling in the first early dark down a snowy road , his headlights pinched between dark walls of trees , when the engine coughed , recovered , coughed again , and died . Down a slight hill he coasted in compression , working the choke , but at the bottom he had to pull over against the three-foot wall of plowed snow . Snow creaked under the tires as the car eased to a stop . The heater fan unwound with a final tinny sigh . Here in its middle age this hitherto dependable mechanism had betrayed him , but he refused to admit immediately that he was betrayed . Some speck of dirt or bubble of water in the gas line , some momentary short circuit , some splash of snow on distributor points or plug connections  --  something that would cure itself before long . But turning off the lights and pressing on the starter brought no result ; he held the choke out for several seconds , and got only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooded carburetor rest and tried again , and nothing . Eventually he opened the door and stepped out onto the packed snow of the road . It was so cold that his first breath turned to iron in his throat , the hairs in his nostrils webbed into instant ice , his eyes stung and watered . In the faint starlight and the bluish luminescence of the snow everything beyond a few yards away swam deceptive and without depth , , glimmering with things half seen or imagined . Beside the dead car he stood with his head bent , listening , and there was not a sound . Everything on the planet might have died in the cold . Indecisively seeking help , he walked to the top of the next rise , but the faintly-darker furrow of the road blurred and disappeared in the murk , the shadows pressed inward , there was no sign of a light . Back at the car he made the efforts that the morality of self-reliance demanded : trying to see by the backward diffusion of the headlamps , he groped over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had satisfied himself that he was helpless . He had known all along that he was . His hands were already stung with cold , and around his ankles between low shoes and trouser cuffs he felt the chill like leg irons . When he had last stopped , twenty miles back , it had been near zero . It could be ten or fifteen below now . So what did he do , stranded in mid-journey fifty miles or more from his destination ? He could hardly go in for help , leaving the sample cases , because the right rear door did n't lock properly . A little jiggling swung it open . And all those drugs , some of them designed to cure anything  --  wonder drugs , sulphas , streptomycin , aureomycin , penicillin , pills and anti-toxins and unguents  --  represented not only a value but a danger . They should not be left around loose . Someone might think they really would cure anything . or quite everything , he told the blue darkness . Not a fouled-up distributor or a cranky coil box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ancient hymn to mechanical transport : If she runs out of dope , just fill her up with soap And the little Ford will ramble right along . He saw himself pouring a bottle of penicillin into the gas tank and driving off with the exhaust blowing happy smoke rings . A mock-heroic montage of scientific discovery unreeled itself  --  white-coated scientists peering into microscopes , adjusting gauges , pipetting precious liquids , weighing grains of powder on miniscule scales . Messenger boys sped with telegrams to the desks of busy executives . A group of observers stood beside an assembly line while the first tests were made . They broke a car 's axle with sledges , gave it a drink of the wonder compound , and drove it off . They demolished the carburetor and cured it with one application . They yanked loose all the wires and watched the same magic set the motor purring . But here he stood.in light overcoat and thin leather gloves , without overshoes , and his car all but blocked the road , and the door could not be locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the heavy cases with him to the next farm or village . He switched on the headlights again and studied the roadside they revealed , and saw a rail fence , with cedars and spruces behind it . When more complex gadgets and more complex cures failed , there was always the Lucifer match . Ten minutes later he was sitting with the auto robe over his head and shoulders and his back against the plowed snowbank , digging the half melted snow from inside his shoes and gloating over the growing light and warmth of the fire . He had a supply of fence rails good for an hour . In that time , someone would come along and he could get a push or a tow . In this country , in winter , no one ever passed up a stranded motorist . In the stillness the flames went straight upward ; the heat was wonderfully pleasant on icy hands and numb ankles and stiffened face . He looked across the road , stained by horses , broken by wheel and runner tracks , and saw how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firelight . He saw too how he would look to anyone coming along : like a calendar picture . B ur no one came along . Fifteen minutes stretched into a half hour , he had only two broken pieces of rail left , the fire sizzled half floating in the puddle of its melting . Restlessly he rose with the blanket around him and walked back up the road a hundred steps . Eastward , above jagged trees , he saw the sky where it lightened to moonrise , but here there was still only the blue glimmer of starlight on the snow . Something long-buried and forgotten tugged in him , and a shiver not entirely from cold prickled his whole body with goose flesh . There had been times in his childhood when he had walked home alone and been temporarily lost in nights like this . In many years he could not remember being out alone under such a sky . He felt spooked , his feet were chilled lumps , his nose leaked . Down the hill car and snow swam deceptively together ; the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not want to wait in . that lonely snow-banked ditch any longer . The sample cases could look after themselves , any motorist who passed could take his own chances . He would walk ahead to the nearest help , and if he found himself getting too cold on the way , he could always build another fire . The thought of action cheered him ; he admitted to himself that he was all but terrified at the silence and the iron cold . Locking the car doors , he dropped his key case in the snow , and panic stopped his pulse as he bent and frantically , with bare hand , brushed away the snow until he found it . The powdery snow ached and burned at his finger tips . He held them a last moment to the fire , and then , bundled like a squaw , with the blanket held across nose and mouth to ease the harshness of the cold in his lungs , he started up the road that looked as smooth as a tablecloth , but was deceptively rough and broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect for this evening . By now , eight o'clock or so , he should have had a smoking supper , the luxury of a hot bath , the pleasure of a brandy in a comradely bar . By now he should be in pajamas making out sales reports by the bedlight , in a room where steam knocked comfortingly in the radiators and the help of a hundred hands was available to him at a word into the telephone . For all of this to be torn away suddenly , for him to be stumbling up a deserted road in danger of freezing to death , just because some simple mechanical part that had functioned for thirty thousand miles refused to function any longer , this was outrage , and he hated it . He thought of garage men and service station attendants he could blame . Ignoring the evidence of the flooded carburetor , he brooded about watered gas that could make ice in the gas line . A man was dependent on too many people ; he was at everybody 's mercy . And then , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon . I NSTANTLY the character of the night changed . The uncertain starlight was replaced at a step by an even flood of blue-white radiance . He looked across a snow meadow and saw how a rail fence had every stake and rider doubled in solid shadow , and how the edge of woods beyond was blackest India ink . The road ahead was drawn with aruler , one bank smoothed by the flood of light , the other deeply shadowed . As he looked into the eye of the moon he saw the air shiver and glint with falling particles of frost . In this White-Christmas night , this GoodKing-Wenceslaus night , he went warily , not to be caught in sentimentality , and to an invisible audience he deprecated it profanely as a night in which no one would believe . Yet here it was , and he in it . With the coining of the moon the night even seemed to warm ; he found that he could drop the blanket from across his face and drink the still air . Along the roadside as he passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . In moonlight openings he saw the snow stitched with tiny perfect tracks , mouse or weasel or the three-toed crowding tracks of partridge . These too , an indigenous part of the night , came back to him as things once known and long forgotten . In his boyhood he had trapped and hunted the animals that made such tracks as these ; it was as if his mind were a snowfield where the marks of their secret little feet had been printed long ago . With a queer tightening of the throat , with an odd pride , he read the trail of a fox that had wallowed through the soft snow from the woods , angling into the packed road and along it for a little way and out again , still angling , across the plowed bank , and then left a purposeful trail of cleanly punched tracks , the hind feet out of line with the front , across the clean snow and into the opposite woods , from shadow across moonlight and into shadow again , mysterious . Turning with the road , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to see the moon-white , shadow-black buildings of a farm , and the weak bloom of light in a window . His feet whined on the snow , dry as metal powder , as he turned in the loop of drive the county plow had cleared . But as he approached the house doubt touched him . In spite of the light , the place looked unused , somehow . No dog welcomed him . The sound of his feet in the snow was alien , the hammer of his knuckles on the door an intrusion . Looking upward for some trace of telephone wires , he saw none , and he could not tell whether the quivering of the air that he thought he saw above the chimney was heat or smoke or the phantasmal falling frost . H cc ELLO ? " he said , and knocked again . " Anybody home ? " No sound answered him . He saw the moon glint on the great icicles along the eaves . His numb hand ached with the pain of knocking ; he pounded with the soft edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door before which he stood , but from the barn , down at the end of a staggered string of attached sheds . A door creaked open against a snowbank and a figure with a lantern appeared , stood for a moment , and came running . The traveler wondered at the way itcame , lurching and stumbling in the uneven snow , until it arrived at the porch and he saw that it was a boy of eleven or twelve . The boy set his lantern on the porch ; between the upturned collar of his mackinaw and the down-pulled stocking cap his face was a pinched whiteness , his eyes enormous . He stared at the traveler until the traveler became aware of the blanket he still held over head and shoulders , and began to laugh . " My car stopped on me , a mile or so up the road , " he said . " I was just hunting a telephone or some place where I could get help . " The boy swallowed , wiped the back of his mitt across his nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door . Warmth rushed in their faces , cold rushed in at their backs , warm and cold mingled in an eddy of air as the door closed . The traveler saw a cot bed pulled close to the kitchen range , and on the cot an old man covered with a quilt , who breathed heavily and whose closed eyes did not open when the two came near . The gray-whiskered cheeks were sunken , the mouth open to expose toothless gums in a parody look of ancient mischief . " He must 've had a shock , " the boy said . " I came in from chores and he was on the floor . " He stared at the mummy under the quilt , and he swallowed . " Has he come to at all ? " " No . " " Only the two of you live here ? " " Yes . " " No telephone ? " " No . " " How long ago did you find him ? " " Chore time . About six . " TILE TRAVELER " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down , ashamed , " It 's near two miles . I was afraid he 'd .. . . " " But you left him . You were out in the barn . " " I was hitching up to go , " the boy said . " I 'd made up my mind . " T HE traveler backed away from the stove , his face smarting with the heat , his fin- gers and feet beginning to ache . He looked at the old man and knew that here , as at the car , he was helpless . The boy 's thin anxious face told him how thoroughly his own emergency had been swallowed up in this other one . He had been altered from a man in need of help to one who must give it . Salesman of wonder cures , he must now produce something to calm this over-worried boy , restore a dying man . Rebelliously , victimized by circumstances , he said , " Where were you going for help ? " " The Hill place . They 've got a phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " About five miles . " " Doctor there ? " " Yes . " " If I took your horse and  --  what is it , sleigh ? ? could someone at the Hills ' bring them back , do you think ? " " Cutter . One of the Hill boys could , I should say . " " Or would you rather go , while I look after your Grandpa ? " " He do n't know you , " the boy said directly . " If he should wake up he might . . . wonder . . . it might . . .. " The traveler grudgingly gave up the prospect of staying in the warm kitchen while the boy did the work . And he granted that it was extraordinarily sensitive of the boy to know how it might disturb a man to wake from sickness in his own house and stare into the face of an utter stranger . " Yes , " he said . " Well , I could call the doctor from the Hills ' . Two miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy had pulled the stocking cap off so that his hair stood on end above his white forehead . He had odd eyes , very large and dark and intelligent , with an expectancy in them . The traveler , watching him with interest , said , " How long have you lived with your . grandfather ? " " Two years . " " Parents living ? " " No sir , that 's why . " " Go to school ? " He got a queer sidling look . " Have to till you 're sixteen . " " Is that the only reason you go ? " What he was trying to force out of the boy came out indirectly , with a shrugging of the shoulders . " Grandpa would take me out if he could . " " Would you be glad ? " " No sir , " the boy said , but would not look at him . " 1 like school . " The traveler consciously corked his flow of questions . Once he himself had been an orphan living with his grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went as he had gone , knocking in imagination at all of life 's closed doors . T HE old man 's harsh breathing filled the over-warm room . " Well , " the traveler said , " maybe you 'd better go finish hitching up . It 's been thirty years since I harnessed a horse . I 'll keep an eye on your Grandpa . " , Pulling the stocking cap over his disheveled hair , the boy slid out the door . The traveler unbuttoned his overcoat and sat down beside the old man , felt the spurting , weak pulse , raised one eyelid with his thumb and looked without comprehension at the uprolled eye He knew it was like feeling over a chilling motor for loose wires , and after two or three abortive motions he gave it up and sat contemplating the gray , sunken face , the unfamiliar face of an old man who would die , and thinking that the face was the only unfamiliar thing about the whole night . The kitchen smells , coffee and peanut butter and the mouldy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of the hot range and of paint baking in the heat , those were as familiar as light or dark . The spectacular night outside , the snowfields and the moon and the mysterious woods , the tracks venturing out across the snow from the protective eaves of firs and skunk spruce , the speculative , imagining expression of the boy 's eyes , were just as familiar . He sat bemused , touching some brink as a man will walk along a cut-bank trying to knock loose the crumbling overhang with an outstretched foot . The ways a man fitted in with himself and with other human beings were curious and complex . And when he heard the jingle and creak outside , and buttoned himself into the overcoat again and wrapped his , shoulders in the blanket and stepped out into the yard , there was a moment when the boy passed him the lines and they stood facing each other in the broken snow . I T WAS a moment like farewell , like a poignant parting . Touched by his pressing sense of familiarity and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid his hand on the boy 's shoulder . " Do n't worry , " he said . " I 'll have someone back here right away . Your grandfather will be all right . Just keep him warm and do n't worry . " He climbed into the cutter and pulled over his lap the balding buffalo robe he found there ; the scallop of its felt edges was like a key that fitted a door . The horses breathed jets of steam in the moonlight , restlessly moving , jingling their harness bells , as the moment lengthened itself . The traveler saw how the boy , now that his - anxiety was somewhat quieted , now that he had been able to unload part of his burden , watched him with a thousand questions in his face , and he remembered how he himself , thirty years ago , had searched the faces of passing strangers for something he could not name , how he had listened to their steps and seen their shadowslengthen ahead of them down roads that led to unimaginable places , and how he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . But none of them had looked back at him as he tried now to look at this boy . He was glad that no names had been spoken and no personal histories exchanged to obscure this meeting , for sitting in the sleigh above the boy 's white upturned serious face he felt that some profound contact had unintentionally , almost casually , been made . For half a breath he was utterly bewitched , frozen at the heart of some icy dream . Abruptly he slapped the reins across the backs of the horses ; the cutter jerked and then slid smoothly out toward the road . The traveler looked back once , to fix forever the picture of himself standing silently watching himself go . As he slid into the road the horses broke into a trot . The icy flow of air locked his throat and made him let go the reins with one hand to pull the hairy , wool-smelling edge of the blanket all but shut across his face . Along a road he had never driven he went swiftly toward an unknown farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise law part of the burden of the boy 's emergency and his own ; but he bore in his mind , bright as moonlight over snow , a vivid wonder , almost an awe . For from that most chronic and incurable of ills , identity , he had looked outward and for one unmistakable instant recognized himself . Yesterday vs . Tomorrow T o THOSE who have decided that the American people do not under-stand how desperate their estate is , the answer may be that with death hanging in the balance they trust their experience . They have never seen yesterday win over tomorrow . They believe that history is on their sine and that they are on the side of the future . ?
