txt The Soviet Union has proposed new negotiations to deal with " con ' crete " rather than general questions on disarmament . This is the burden of a letter from Nikolai A. Bulganin , Soviet Premier , to President Eisenhower . The text of the official communication was made public late today by tie White House without . United States comment except for a statement by the President 's press secretary , James C. Hagerty , that there was " nothing new " in it . Marshal Bulganin 's letter could be read to imply a suggestion for East-West talks on some formal basis : In the text as made public here , however , he did not specify the form of the conversa ? tions he was proposing . The relevant passage said the United Nations Commission on Disarmament and its subcommittee had produced no positive results and that a way should be found to break the deadlock . It said negotiations should be places on a level on which concrete questions would be taken up concerning the reduction of armaments , particularly reduction in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken toward the prohibition of atomic weapons . Marshal Bulganin 's communication , which was in reply to one from the President of Aug. 4 , again rejected the Eisenhower proposal for " open sky " aerial inspection of armaments . It sought to put entirely upon the West the onus for the failure thus far of disarmament efforts and strongly implied that there could be no question of reunifying Germany so long as present West German policy was maintained . It amounted to an effort , perhaps timed by the Russians ' awareness that a great domestic political campaign heavily involving the " peace " issue was beginning here , to present President Eisenhower as unreasonably obstructive of disarmament . Marshal Bulganin attempted particularly to press the President to agree to a halt of atomc an dhydrogen-weapons tests . He sought as well to present the Soviet Union as a nation attempting to take the lead for disarmament while the West was raising unacceptable preconditions . The reply to President Eisenhower 's complaints that the Rus sians had not carried out agree ments reached at the Big Four conference at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the West that was causing all the trouble . These were some of the high points of the letter : 9A return by Marshal Bul ganin to his earlier point that while the Soviet Union had re duced its army by " more than 1,800,000 men " the West had not done likewise . 9An assertion that President Eisenhower had proposed no " concrete " steps for reducing armaments . 9An assertion that aerial in spection of the kind proposed by the President had " no bearing on disarmament . " 9An assertion that the President was making acceptance of aerial inspection a " prerequisite to any measures whatsoever fort , disarmament . " Hitting hard on the theme of an end to atomic and hydrogen tests , the Soviet Premier asserted it was " a known fact " that this could be done without any international control agreement . As to Germany , Marshal Bulganin described developments , including West Germany 's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , as " sinister . " He said in substance that if an agreement on German unification was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
