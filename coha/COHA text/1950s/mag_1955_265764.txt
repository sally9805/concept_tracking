The Greeks have a word for emigres who , once poverty-stricken , return to visit their native land flush with the prosperity of half a lifetime in the U.S. They call them heelobowie , a rough approximation of " hello boy . " In many a Greek village , the returning heelobowie ranks almost as a patron saint ; each village strives to outdo its neighbors in providing a lavish welcome for him , and even after his return to the land of his adoption , legends of his largesse live on among the villagers . <P> Mike Colikas was born 70 years ago in the Greek village of Pyrgi on Chios <P> Island , one of seven places which claim to be the birthplace of Homer . He left home at the age of 23 to seek his fortune in the U.S. After a number of false starts , he found it as the proprietor of a barbershop and beauty parlor in Pittsburgh , Pa . Three times since luck smiled upon him , Mike had returned to Pyrgi as a heelobowie . In 1926 he dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . In 1939 he paid another visit , and left behind in the church tower the biggest and handsomest clock the villagers had ever seen . Last summer , after selling his business , Mike went back to pay still another visit to Pyrgi . Once again he opened his purse and his heart , to spruce up the local schoolhouse and the village square . <P> Mike asked nothing in return for his generosity , but when election day came up , the contending candidates for mayor both withdrew and the villagers swarmed to the polls to elect Mike Colikas by a vote of 2,145 to 2 . After the polls were closed , the two dissident voters came around to apologize in person . They had meant to cast their votes for Mike , they said , but they were illiterate and could n't read the ballot . <P> Mike Colikas , the poor boy of Pyrgi. was pleased and happy , but there was one small hitch : as an American , he could not accept public office under the Greek government without relinquishing his U.S. citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about which country Mike Colikas felt he belonged in . " I 'll tell you very sincerely , " he said . " I 'm homesick for Pittsburgh . "
