As the voting for a President of France dragged on at Versailles , ballot after ballot , the mood of the French press and public grew darker with rage and indignation . In Lyon , citizens hung up a street banner reading : THE CONGRESS OF VERSAILLES IS A MOCKERY . FRENCHMEN OF ALL OPINIONS , SHOW DISAPPROVAL BY PUTTING YOUR FLAGS AT HALF-MAST . What had begun as a " glorious uncertainty " ( in the words of mercurial Foreign Minister Georges Bidault ) had degenerated into an inglorious ordeal . Although the presidency is supposed to be above politics , it was partisan politics that blocked a choice for so long . <P> Premier Joseph Laniel , who had led most of the way and was at one point a hair 's breadth from victory , saw that he could not win . He approved three other candidates , all from his own conservative Independent Republican Party . Of these , the one who proved most acceptable was a 71-year-old Senator named Ren Coty . On the eleventh ballot , Coty had 71 votes ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had 477-more than enough to win . Sad and tired , Loser Laniel congratulated him . <P> Winner Coty is unknown outside France , little known in France except to his parliamentary colleagues and an enigma to everyone for his views-whatever they are - on the liveliest topic of all , EDC . He is not a nonentity ; he is , in fact , a case study in the solid bourgeois qualities that many Frenchmen want in their President . He may , just possibly , do very well in the job . Born of solid Norman stock ( he is no kin to the late Perfumer Franois Coty , who was really a Corsican named Spoturno ) , Ren Coty hung out his shingle as a lawyer in 1905 , enlisted as a private in World War I and won a Croix de guerre , was first elected to the Parliament 's lower house in 1923 . Later , as a Senator , he had time for a comfortable law practice in Paris , specializing in bankruptcy cases , and became known as the " amiable liquidator . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the men who try to run it , and once remarked : " It 's a pity to shoot the pianist when the piano is out of tune . " Socialist Vincent Auriol , the outgoing President , had hardly been better known when he was elected seven years ago , but he has been , by common consent , an excellent President .
