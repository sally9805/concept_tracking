Behind guarded doors . Secretary of State Dulles and Soviet Ambassador Georgi N. Zarubin sat down in Dulles ' rose-mauve-carpeted office for half an hour this week to talk about a time , place and agenda for a conference on atomic questions. - The Dulles-Zarubin meeting was a fruit of President Eisenhower 's U.N . speech proposing an atomic-material pool for peaceful uses . At first the Russians had attacked the speech ; then , sniffing free-world approval of Ike 's idea , they said they were willing to talk it over . Dulles suggested a preliminary exchange of views in Washington , and last week the Kremlin agreed . Two days later , the Atomic Energy Commission announced that this month " men and materials will begin moving to the Pacific proving grounds for weapons tests of all categories , " i.e. , fission and thermonuclear.
