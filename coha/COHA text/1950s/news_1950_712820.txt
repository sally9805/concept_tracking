txt Last month , Donald E. Wadsworth , .17 , was thinking about his track career at : Jefferson High School here . This month he is starting his career as a banker . Donald , along with eight other handpicked high school seniors , is , spending his Easter-vacation in the bookkeeping department of the big United States National Bank . He's-among-the firstgroupchoseniby U .. S. National , the nation 's 31st largest ' bank , for Its unique new personnel training prograM . This schooling Is a far-cry , from the old days , when a young fellow began his banking career as a bank messenger . The program being started here not only trains the boys in the bank ; but It sends them to college for four ** a period of - six years , the trainees sandwich months of bank exiierlence between college , work . . They 're ' promised . permanent jobs in the bank , starting at $250 per month , when they graduate . Personnel Problem Like many , other big banks in the nation , U. S. National has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants . Under this newly-devised program , President Edward C. Sammons says , " 1 think we 've hit on something that will supply our needs adequately . " Echoes Vice President Frank L. Beach , in charge of personnel : " We 're trying to win boys to banking , rather than strait-jacketing them . Our people are instructed to see a future officer of the bank in every boy taken in . " He adds : " We 're guessing this . program will supply about half the bank 's officer needs . " The U. S. National has 172 officers . And , being a big institution with 1,500 employes , it has quite an employment turnover . After the Easter vacation , Donald ( his father is a pipe ' company mechanic ) and fellow trainees will continue to get in a few hours of banking weekly . On week days they will work from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m . For this work they will be paid 75 cents an hour . However , when they graduate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $140 monthly . This will be stepped up $10 after three months , with another $10 ' added after six months . Two Boys Per Ledger This first bank training period will last 15 months . The bank plans to divide up a bank ledger , letting two boys do the work of one fully-trained bookkeeper . The plan has only one catch and a good one : During this first 15 months , Donald and fellow trainees must save $100 monthly in Special accounts . What they do with the rest of their salary is their own business . Then , in September , 1951 , Donald and his classmates may matriculate at any college of their choosing . According to the schedule the bank has drawn up , each lad will then have saved $1,500 . The ' U. S. National will put up $180 tuition per school year . The courses ? , Vice President Beach says the boys can take any subject ' they like , just so it leads towards a career in banking . If Donald Wadsworth wants to go out for col lege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U. S National hopes its trainees will go in for campus activities . But they must make average or better marks . Any lad can be dropped from the program because " of lack of interest or ability required . " First . Year Ends In ' 52 According to schedule , Donald and his fellow trainees will end their first year of college training late in the summer of 1952 . Then they will go back . for a 13-month tour of bank duty . This will include bookkeeping and teller work . The boys again must save 100 monthly , because in the fall of 1953 they are to be hack at college for another 12 months , This work-in-the-bank and go-to-college schedule is repeated until graduation , which Nimes six years and two months following high school graduation . In Donald Wadsworth 's case , he 'll be only a few months past 23 years of age when he takes up full time work in the bank at $250 per month . His progress from there on is up to him , but chances are good that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager of one of U. S  --  National 's 40 branches scattered over Oregon . Studies show that U. S. National each year needs six new branch managers and nine assistants .
