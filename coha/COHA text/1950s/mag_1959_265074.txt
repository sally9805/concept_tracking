I have sold out for years . Just recall the pathetic trash I have made month after month , year after year ... I am a decent enough man , not too bright perhaps , but impelled by some ideas as to conviction and principles .

At 15 , he sailed as workaway on a schooner from Connecticut to California . He shipped as fireman on a steamer , fished off the Grand Banks , finally got his master 's papers and wound up part owner of a schooner that was supposed to carry passengers from Hawaii to Tahiti . Only when his ship piled up in a gale did the handsome blond sailor finally agree to take a Hollywood offer and a crack at pictures . <P> Soon Sterling Hayden was busy playing the uncombed adventurer of half a dozen so-so movies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II , as a Marine lieutenant , Hayden wound up in Italy , and had the time of his life running guns to Tito 's partisans .

Last week a friend got a letter : Hayden , his kids and his crew were aboard The Wanderer , en route to Tahiti . " It 's time to go , " wrote Hayden . <P> Betty Ann alerted the Coast Guard , charging that his craft was not seaworthy . Her lawyers went to court with another sheaf of charges , ranging from kidnaping to conspiracy to commit contempt of court . But for the time being , at least , The Wanderer was at sea . At 42 , Sterling Hayden , in his own words " a decent enough man , not too bright perhaps , " had finally made his breakout .
