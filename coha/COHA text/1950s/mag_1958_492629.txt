In the age of technology which now surrounds us , and which boasts of its triumphs over nature , one thing is ever more apparent to the anthropologist  --  the student of man . We have not really conquered nature because we have not conquered ourselves . It is modern man , Homo sapiens , " the wise " as he styles himself , who is now the secret nightmare of man . It is his own long shadow that falls across his restless nights and that follows soundlessly after the pacing feet of statesmen . Not long ago I chanced to walk through the Hall of Man in one of the country 's large museums . Persons of great learning had been instrumental in erecting those exhibits , and I hoped to find there some clue as to human destiny , some key that might unlock in a few succinct sentences the nature of man . The exhibit ended in a question mark before an atomic machine and a graph showing the almost incredible energy that now lay open to the hand of man . Needless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of humanity within that hall . But as I turned and went in the other direction , step by step , eon by eon , back into the past , I came to a scarcely human thing crouched over a little fire of sticks and peering up at me under shaggy brows . The caption read : " Man begins his technological climb up the energy ladder . He discovers fire . " I walked a short way backward and forward . I read the captions . I looked again at the creatures huddled over a fire of sticks  --  at the woman clutching a child to her breast . Again I searched the hall . This was the sum total of all that science had here seen fit to emphasize graphically as important to the human story . The hunters ' tools were there , the economic revolution effected by agriculture was ably presented . Summarized ( Continued from Page 29 ) before my eyes , populations grew , cities and empires rose and fell , and still man 's energy accumulated . One saw another thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last continent confronted continent and the powers of death to a world lay in the hands of the descendants of that maned woman and her consort by the fire of sticks . I hesitated again before those forgotten engines of the past , for it seemed to me that there was lacking here some clue , Some vita ! essence of the creature man , and that 1 was looking upon stone and polished sword and catapult from some place just a little remote and distorted , " This is the history of man , " the caption ran through my head , and at ! hat moment , finally , I knew I was looking at the T H E past through the eyes of a modern twenticth-century American , or for that matter , a Russian . There was no basic difference . In that whole exhibit were ranged the energies of wheat and fire and oil , but of what man had dreamed in his relations with other men , there was little trace . Yet it is only on paper , or , in human heads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sought successfully to transcend himself , his appetites and his desires . In that great room was scarcely a hint of the most remarkable story of all , // the rise of a value-creating animal and the way in which his intangible dreams had been modified and transformed to bring him to the world he faces today . The educated public has come to accept the verdict of science that man , along with the plant and animal world about us , is the product of endless evolutionary divergence and change . In accepting this verdict of science , however , men have frequently failed to inquire in what way human evolution may differ from that of other animals , or by what extra dangers and responsibilities the human brain may be haunted . In the revolt from the fanatical religiosity of past centuries we have too often welcomed with open arms a dogmatic scientific naturalism which , like the devil with Faust , seemed to offer unlimited material power over nature while , at the same time , assuring us that our moral responsibilities were limited and excusable since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culmination of a line of apes that chanced to descend upon the ground . Darwin and his compatriots , struggling to establish for their day a new and quite amazing interpretation of human history , placed great emphasis upon man 's relationship to the animal world about him . Indeed , at times they overemphasized man 's kinship with the existing apes , partly because of their anxiety to prove the reality of man 's descent from lower forms of life , partly because in their lifetime the course of human evolution was very imperfectly known from fossils , The result was that Darwin 's own interpretation of the early stages of human evolution wavered between a theory involving an early and Edenlike seclusion on some oceanic island , to a later more ferocious and competitive existence on one of the major continents . These extremes of interpretation need not concern us now except to illustrate the hesitancy with which Darwin attempted to account for some of the peculiar qualities of man . Today we are well convinced of the general course of man 's rise from some ancient anthropoid line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to our attention . Each year the public grows more accustomed to this history , feels more at home in the natural world which it casually assumes to he dominated by struggle , by a dog-eat-dog interpretation of existence which descends to us from the Darwinian period . Some time ago I had a letter from a professional friend of mine commenting upon the education his daughter was receiving at a polite finishing school . " She has been taught , " he wrote to me a little sadly , " that there are two kinds of people , the tough- and the tender-minded . Her professor , whose science I will not name , informed her that the tough-minded would survive . " This archaic remark shook me . I knew it was not the product of the great selfless masters of the field , but it betrayed an attitude which demanded an answer , In that answer is contained the whole uniqueness of man . Man has not really survived by toughness in a major sense  --  even the great evolutionists Darwin and Wallace had had trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through tenderness . Man in his arrogance may boast that the battle is to the strong , that pity and affection are signs of weakness . Nevertheless , in spite of the widespread popularity of such ideas , the truth is that if man at heart were not a tender creature toward his kind , a loving creature in a peculiarly special way , he would long since have left his bones to the wild dogs that roved the African grasslands where he first essayed the great adventure of becoming human . April 56 , 1958 The professor who.growled to his class of future mothers about being tough-minded spent a childhood which is among the most helpless and prolonged of any living creature . If our parents had actually practiced certain of the philosophies that now flourish among us , or if our remote ancestors had achieved that degree of sophistication which would have enabled them to discount their social responsibilities for the day 's pleasure , we  --  you and I and all of us  --  would never have enjoyed the experience of living . Man , in the achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighing stars or atoms  --  can not grow that brain in the nine months before birth , It is , moreover , a peculiarly plastic brain , intended to receive impressions from the social world around it . Instinct , unlike the case in the world of animals , is here reduced to a minimum . This brain must grow and learn , be able to profit by experience . In man much of that growth and learning comes after birth . The result is that the human infant enters the world in a peculiarly helpless and undeveloped condition . His childhood is lengthy because his developing brain must receive a large store of information and ways of behavior from the social group into which it is born . It must acquire the complicated tool of speech . The demands of learning thus placed upon the human offspring are greater than in any other animal . They have made necessary the existence of a continued family , rather than the casual sex life of many of the lower animals , Although the family differs in many of its minor features in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tender and continuing care of the human offspring through the lengthened period of childhood . The social regulations of all human groups promote the welfare of the young . Man 's first normal experience of life involves maternal and paternal care and affection . It continues over the years of childhood . Thus the creature who strives at times to deny the love within himself , to reject the responsibilities to which he owes his own existence , who grows vocal about " tough-mindedness " and " the struggle for existence , " is striving to reject his own human heritage . For without the mysteriously increased growth rate of the brain and the correlated willingness of fallible , loving adults to spend years in nursing the helpless offspring they have produced , man would long since have vanished from the earth . We take the simple facts of human life too much for granted . To the student of human evolution this remarkable and unique adjustment of our peculiar infancy to a lengthened family relationship between adults is one of the more mysterious episodes in the history of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in one group of creatures  --  that giving rise to man  --  has it been successfully developed in the three billion years or so that life has existed on the planet . Family life is a fact that underlies everything else about man  --  his capacity for absorbing culture , his ability to learn  --  everything , in short , that enables us to call him human . He is born of love and he exists by reason of a love more continuous than in any other form of life . Yet this , in all Irony , is the creature who professes to pierce the shams of life and to live by tough-mindedness ! Let us see how this nascent and once-aspiring creature now lives in great danger of re-entering the specialized trap that his ancestors escaped from ages ago when they evolved a brain capable of abstract thought . " Man is the dwarf of himself , " Emerson once wrote , and never , perhaps , has he been more that dwarf than in this age where he appears to wield so much power . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is ; till capable of creeping out of the interior of his thickening crust of technological accomplishment to gaze around him with a sense of dissatisfaction and unease . He has every reason to feel this way . For man has never lived before in so great an age of exterior accomplishment , so tremendous a projection of himself into his machines , nor yet so disheartening a period in all that stands for the nobler aspects of the human dream . His spiritual yearnings to transcend his own evil qualities are dimming as he is constantly reminded of his animal past . His desire to fly away to Mars , still warring , still haunted by his own black shadow , is the adolescent escape mechanism of a creature who would prefer to infect the outer planets with his problems than to master them at home . // Even now in the enthusiasm for new discoveries , reported public interviews with scientists tend to run increasingly toward a future replete with more inventions , stores of energy , babies in bottles , deadlier weapons . Relatively few have spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those intangible aspects of life which set the tone of a civilization and determine , in the end , whether it will be cruel or humane ; whether , in other words , the modern world , so far as its interior spiritual life is concerned , will be stainless steel like its exterior , or display the rich fabric of genuine human experience . The very indifference of many scientists to such matters reveals how far man has already gone toward the world of the " outside , " of no memory , of contempt toward all that makes up the human tradition . " Wars will be fought in space , " prophesied a high military authority recently . " Teach children the hard things first . " " Ah , but what hard things ? " the teacher asks , because youth is shaped in the teaching and becomes what he is taught . Without spiritual insight and generosity , without the ability to rise beyond power and mechanical extensions , man will encounter in place of the nature which gave him birth only that vast , expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more terrible threatens to confront him in his final hour . It is increasingly plain that if we read the past as a justification for a kind of moral complacency , an animal limit which justifies military remarks such as " man will always fight , " we have not read it well . Until man came , it is true , the evolution of life had been an evolution of parts . It had been hook and clutching bur and fang , struggling upward in an age-long effort . Life had been shaped by the blind forces of the inanimate world . All it had that was different was the will to crawl , the will to Find the crevice , the niche , the foothold on this mountain of inanimate matter , and to hold its place against the forces which ever seek to disperse and destroy the substance of life . In all that prehuman world there had been no animal capable of looking back or forward . No living creature had wept above another 's grave . There had been nothing to comprehend the whole . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of that time there occurred a small soundless concussion . In a sense it was the most terrible explosion in the world , because it forecast and contained all the rest . The corus eating heat of atomic fission , the red depths of the hydrogen bomb  --  all were potentially contained in a little packet of gray matter that , somewhere between about a million and 600,000 years ago , quite suddenly appears to have begun to multiply itself in the thick-walled cranium of a ground-dwelling ape . The event itself took place in silence , the silence of cells multiplying at an enormous pace under a small bone roof , the silence of some great fungus coming up at night in a forest glade . The eruption had about it the utter unpredictability of nature when she chooses to bypass her accepted laws and to hurtle headlong into some new and unguessed experiment . Even the solar system has now felt the impact of that tiny , soundless explosion . The fact that it was the product of evolutionary forces does not lessen its remarkable quality . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have turned away in weariness , nothing had moved but the slime and its creations . Toward the end of that time a small , unprepossessing animal sat on his haunches by a rock pile on a waste of open ground . He clutched a stick and chewed the end of it meditatively . He was setting the fuse of the great explosion . In his head was the first twinkle of that tenuous rainbow bridge which stretches between earth and the city of the gods . At that moment the ancestor of man had become the molder of things , rather than their victim , but he had , at the same time . suffered a major loss of instinctive adjustments to life . As the psychologist Jung very aptly remarks : " the forlornness of consciousness in our world is due primarily to the loss of instinct , and the reason for this lies in the development of the human mind over the past eon . " In a recent paper given before the Research Conference on Growth and Aging , my colleague , Dr. W. M. Krogman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential of an evolved cerebral cortex , enabled him to focus upon the quality of things rather than mere quantity . " Man has become , in other words , a value-creating animal . He sets his own goals and more and more exerts his own will upon recalcitrant matter and the natural forces of the universe . In this activity he has passed from the specialized evolution of the parts of the body to a projection of such " part " evolution upon his machines and implements . ( Continued on Page 124 ) ( Continued from Page 122 ) In this respect man is a unique being . Having achieved high intellectual ability , he may remain comparatively unchanged in structure while all around hint other animals are still subjected to the old laws of specialized selection . His brain evolves parts and replaces them , but only upon man 's mechanical inventions : his tools . This fact gives man a kind of freedom which none of the crawlers-up-themountain ever had . He is. as the philosopher Henri Bergson once remarked , a reservoir of indetermination : his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is here that we come upon what I choose to call the " unnatural " aspect of man : unnatural , that is , in the sense that there is nothing else like it on the planet . Even Darwin confessed that his principle of limited perfection  --  that is , the conception that life would evolve only sufficiently to maintain itself in competition with other life or to adjust to changes in its environment  --  had been upset in the case of man . A part , such as a tooth or an eye , could reach perfection only for a given purpose in a particular environment . With man , however , Darwin professed to observe no foreseeable limit to the development of the mental faculties . Psychology had once regarded human nature as something consisting of separate abilities given to man at the time of creation . Mind was a fixed , unchanging thing that molded history . Now it was to be seen as malleable and moving , subject like the body , though in a different and more mysterious way , to change . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature in the old fixed sense , except the human ability to become what it most desired in terms of the social world in which it existed . As we have seen , the mind 's power of choice has opened to man a tremendous freedom , but it is a freedom whose moral implications only a few great spiritual leaders have fully grasped . Increasingly , at the very height of the human achievement , there loom two obstacles which threaten to cast man back into the world of parts , tools and processes , in a way he has scarcely imagined . In fact there are times when it appears man is so occupied with the world he is now creating that he has already lost a sense for what may be missing in his society . He is deeply influenced by his knowledge of the past and the animal limitations which it seems to place upon his earlier spiritual aspirations . Equally , he confuses " progress " with his mechanical extensions which represent his triumph over the caprices of biological selection . Man , in a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinosaurs , though by quite another track . On a night during the period of the Korean War , I sat with an old hunter at a campfire in the wilds of Wyoming . Around us in the mountain dark were geological strata that contained the remains of dinosaurs . My companion threw a log upon the lire . As the flames rose upward , 1 could see the bronzed old American face looking at me across the lire . It could have been a face from any period out of the frontier past . And it was the frontier that spoke to me from the man who had two sons in Korea . " America , " he said , " needs a strong enemy . It will keep her from getting fat and make her strong . " 1 nodded dubiously . It was a philosophy of the frontier , of the woods . But I saw in my mind 's eye the fate of the colossi that lay about us in the stone . They had warred and thundered , shaken the earth with their tread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and teeth like bear traps . Spikes had glistened on their tails and foreheads . In the end they had vanished with their monstrous tumult , and some small , ratlike mammals and a few birds had come hesitantly into the arena they had vacated . It had been a war of parts , won , not by the participants , but by some small , relatively intelligent creatures that had hidden in the trees . " We need a strong enemy , " my friend repeated . I did not doubt it was being said also in the Siberian forests and on the Manchurian plains . Faster and faster labor the technicians , the scientists of parts . They labor so today . The pace grows ever swifter . Already , and I quote from one recent industrial report , " scientists and engineers can be utilized more effectively by confining their work almost entirely to the field of their specialization . " This remark indicates the reemergence of the war of parts , and if continued , it forecasts the death of all we claim as human . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creative thinker capable of using his brain out of the immediate context of his surroundings who is the innovator , the religious leader , the artist , the man who in all ages has been , in the words of Lancelot Whyte , " the very creator of humanity . " " Man , " John Burroughs once remarked , " is like the trainer of wild beasts who , at his peril , for one instant relaxes his mastery over them . Gravity , electricity , fire , flood , hurricane , will crush or consume him if his hands are unsteady or his wits tardy . " It is true that man has been badly knocked about by raw nature , but that nature has never organized her powers for the deliberate purpose of destroying man . He has even benefited and had his wits sharpened by her vagaries . Man has survived the long inexorable marchings of the glacial ice that pressed him back upon the Mediterranean and threatened his annihilation in Europe . He has left his bones under the boiling mud of volcanic upheavals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the storm that blows unceasingly through nature . He has seen cities go down , cities full of adept artisans and clever technicians , cities fallen to the sands when an old enemy cut off the water supply . Who was that enemy ? It was man . He is the other face of that nature man has feared . Now , in an age when man lays his hands upon the lightning , and heat in millions of degrees shudders in his confining mechanisms , an old shadow , a monstrous growing shadow , falls across the doorway of all the world 's laboratories . It is merely man , merely the creature by the fire of sticks , merely the museum wielder of the sling and spear , but now grown large enough to shadow the sun . This creature thinks with all the malignant concentration that man has so far escaped in nature , and it thinks toward just one purpose  --  the creation of the ultimate weapon . Ultimate , ultimate , and still more ultimate , as if there were a growing secret zero in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero , so much does it appeal to some ancient power-loving streak in our still primitive natures , that whether men plan aggression or defense from it , they are , in degree , corrupted . At heart they know the word neutral has lost its meaning ; that the blow , if it falls , will mean what the ultimate weapon means  --  death to green grass and singing bird , death to a world . Nevertheless , as I have said , no creature in the world demands more love than man ; no creature is less adapted to survive without it . Man is a paradox . Individually most men hate and fear war in spite of much of the talk of professional militarists about instinct . Men have to be drummed to war , propagandized to war , assured their cause is righteous . Even dictators have to render lip service to humanitarian principles . None of this sounds particularly as though an " instinct " for war existed . There are , instead , things from the old dark midnight of the past that suffice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the stranger was two eyes in the dark beyond the fore at a cave mouth ; aggressive hungers that were stoked to a high pitch by nature in the million years of man 's wandering across the wastes of an open world . Man is not completed  --  that is the secret of his paradoxical behavior . He is not made . He is , perhaps , about to be . Once long ago in the Middle Ages he was called Homo duplex  --  a thing half of dust and half of spirit . The term welt expresses his predicament . Today we know a great deal about human evolution , but as scientists we have failed , I sometimes think , to convey successfully to the public the marvel of the human transformation . We have shown man the anthropoidal skulls of his ancestors . We have convinced him that the human brain is an instrument of ancient origin which has not sprung full blown into being , but rather partakes of both the old and the new ; that it includes the imperfections which are written into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs that are concealed here and there in our bodies and which tell tales of the long past  --  of trees and waters in our lost ancestral world  --  have their corollary in the mind of man . His flashes of unreasoning temper , his frustrations , his occasional irrationalities are , some of them , echoes out of an older , more primitive machine . Yet signs of affection and mutual co-operation , love of beauty , dreams of a future life , can be traced into forms of man physically more primitive than ourselves . Now , however , it is the present which concerns us  --  the present that creates tomorrow . Who contends for it  --  the rocket century with its vast zero looming over the future ? The now is our responsibility , not that of the hoarse-voiced animal that came from the wood in a dream and made our today . Nor can we call to those pleasant , wide-browed people whom we strive to conjure up as inhabiting the comfortable future of our novels and dreams . They are lost in the unfathomable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want them deeply ? Do we want them enough , in the heavy-handed violence of this day , to live toward them at all cost , to struggle once more against the destructive forces of nature ? To stand up and face , as every man must face , that ancient lurking shadow of himself ? Is the price of acquiring brains , brains to look before and after in the universe , only to mean subservience to man after escaping subservience to nature that has lasted for a million years ? is it to mean acquiescence in the plans of those clever intellects who talk glibly of psychological " break-throughs " and the subliminal control of nations ? Is it for this that men have labored up the dark pathway behind us and died often and blindly for some vision they could scarcely see ? A society has an image of itself , its way of life . This image is a wavering , composite picture reflected from millions of minds . If the image is largely compounded of the events of the present ; if tradition is weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle degrees . A " cold war " such as we are fighting demands great tenacity in democratic institutions . Secrecy grows , technicians multiply , two great societies shoulder each other down a road that may look increasingly alike to both . The humane tradition  --  arts , letters , philosophy , the social sciences  --  threatens to be ignored as unrealistic in what has become a technological race for survival . Man was a social animal long before he was man . But when he created huge societies and elaborated the world of cul ture that surrounds him today , he was acting , in some degree , consciously . Man , unlike the animal , is aware of the nature of his society . His conscious image of it is tremendously important in shaping what it will become . It is this that helps to build the human future , and why the future must be fought for day by day in the lives of innumerable and humble men . Man , whether he engages in war or not , is in a pyramiding technological society whose values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a material age is that we do not abandon or forget that man has always sought to transcend himself spiritually , and that this is part of his strange heritage . It is a heritage which must be preserved in our schools and churches , for in a society without deep historical memory , the future ceases to exist and the present becomes a meaningless cacophony . A Future worth contemplating will not be achieved solely by flights to the far side of the moon . It will not be found in space . It will be achieved , if it is achieved at all , only in our individual hearts . This is the choice that has been presented man , as a free agent , as one who can look before and after in the cosmos . And-if indeed men do achieve that victory , they will know , with the greater insight they will then possess , that it is not a human victory , but nature 's new and final triumph in the human heart  --  perhaps that nature which is also God . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote , " is the little telltale rift in Nature which shows there is something beyond or behind her . " It remains for man , in his moral freedom , to prove that statement true .
