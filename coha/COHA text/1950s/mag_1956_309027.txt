Having battled the crush at the Russians ' Claridge 's tea-fight ( see above ) without much success , Harold Stassen and his wife were on the point of going home when up barged Andrei Gromyko . " Have you met Khrushchev yet ? " asked Gromyko , who is Stassen 's opposite number on the five-man U.N . subcommittee meeting in London to discuss disarmament . Seconds later Stassen found himself in an inner sanctum , peeling grapes with the Kremlin 's masters . For two hours he listened to the bluntest Russian talk yet on the subject of disarmament . <P> Until Khrushchev opened his mouth , the State Department had been feeling discreetly optimistic ; all through the weary weeks Gromyko had asked pertinent questions and avoided flat answers . Perhaps the Russians really were seriously considering President Eisenhower 's dramatic " open skies " proposal for mutual aerial reconnaissance . But to Stassen in the meeting room at Claridge 's , Khrushchev said the whole U.S. plan was nothing but a trick to let U.S. planes photograph bomb targets in Russia . The U.S.S.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Soviet Union , Khrushchev went on blandly , wants to cut armed forces right now-and worry about schemes for inspection later . He dismissed the U.S. plan as " too cautious . " And he rejected U.S. insistence that German reunification must be a precondition of general disarmament , as " a package deal " that the Soviet would " never buy . " <P> Gulping , " Quite a thorough discussion , " Stassen rushed off from his two-hour chat to cable the worst to Washington . Next day Gromyko agreed to " consider " a few changes in the latest Russian plan , but Western diplomats interpreted this as a maneuver to fasten the propaganda blame on the U.S. should talks now end . <P> At their farewell press conference in Britain , B. &; K. openly ridiculed the disarmament subcommittee . Bulganin hinted that it might better have been called the " subcommittee on concealing the arms race . " When someone asked whether the Soviet Union would allow inspection teams to check Russian nuclear-weapon stocks , Khrushchev said jauntily : " Our comrade Gromyko has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a grey hair in Gromyko 's head , this got a laugh . Khrushchev then said : " It is my prophecy he will become grey by the time they agree . "
