txt The other day our Washington Wire carried this terse notice : " Defense Mobilizer Gray turns on the air conditioning to combat overheating in his office . " While recognizing that a lot of Washington offices . especially the Office of Defense Mobilization. may seem a bit warmer nowadays what with Sputnik and all , turning on the air conditioning to reduce the temperature in a room heated by a heating system hardly seemed the best way to go about it . So we asked our Washington reporter who covers Mr. Gordon Gray 's activities how come he was spendinggood money to cool off heat . and how was Mr. Gray feeling otherwise these days ? The answer we got we should have known . Whoever built the building which houses Mr. Gray 's offices arranged matters so that Mr. Gray ca n't turn off the heat . Neither can he open the windows . So the air conditioner was the last defense Mr. Gray could mobilize against the janitor . The answer we should have known is that Mr. Gray is just in Washington , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of centralized Government heating .
