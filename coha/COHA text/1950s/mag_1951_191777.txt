In Berlin , trouble comes where least expected . For five years the U.S. military post has operated a twice-weekly sightseeing tour of the city without incident . One day last week four U.S. buses , bearing 73 tourists , including twelve children , were returning from their customary swing through the Soviet sector when they ran into a tense , but typical , Berlin situation . <P> A group of Soviet-zone Volkspolizei , with police dogs , had just arrived at the Potsdamer Platz . Their mission : to prevent Germans from the British sector from distributing leaflets in the Soviet sector . As the four U.S. buses slowly circled the Potsdamer Platz , the tense Volkspolizei were facing a scornful West Berlin crowd safe behind the border rail of the British sector . A bus tourist , Charles Myers of Kansas City , tried to photograph the scowling Volkspolizei . The police spotted him , rushed to stop the bus . <P> The bus drivers stepped on the gas , tore into the British sector . Walter Waaske , driver of one bus , told what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his pistol toward my bus and shot . The bullet hit the windshield , and I could not see through it . I drove as fast as possible toward Potsdamer Strasse . Two more bullets hit the bus . One went through the coat of an officer sitting behind me . " One of the passengers was 13-year-old Kristin Norstad , daughter of Lieut . General Norstad , commander of the U.S. Air Force in Europe . She called the incident " the most exciting adventure since Hopalong Cassidy . " In all , the police fired 12 to 15 shots . <P> Major General Lemuel Mathewson , U.S. commander in Berlin , in a note to Sergei A. Dengin , Soviet-zone representative on the Four-Power Commission , charged the Volkspolizei with " irresponsible and outrageous action , " demanded punishment . Dengin replied that American soldiers in the buses had incited " West sector rowdies " against the police . Dengin , however , made a personal apology to Mathewson . <P> Two days later , more trouble broke out at Dreilinden , on the line between the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an automobile screamed for help . After West German police had rescued her , she said that she was Johanna Buechner , 30 , secretary of the former East German Minister of Heavy Industry , Fritz Selbermann . She had fled to the Western sector , and the two East German police in the automobile had kidnaped her and were taking her back to the Russian area . The Western police arrested one of the East German policemen . Slamming down the zone barrier , the East German guards threatened to keep the international highway closed until their captured comrade was returned . An hour later , the barrier went up again . The arrested East German policeman had asked for and obtained asylum in the Western sector of Berlin .
