 | 11 IT WAS a blustery October afternoon in 1953 when the schooner Mary Anne put into the harbor at Pine Island to deliver the mail . On the end of the rickety wharf in front of the Island Inn , John Hunter , a strong , dark-haired boy waited . Dressed in frayed skiing pants which Sylvia had made for him out of a pair she had had as a girl , and a heavy Navy raincoat Bart had had in the war , John stood bracing himself against the wind as the old vessel battered her way up the bay . When Herb Andrews , her captain , brought her alongside the wharf , John leaned far out over the water and accepted the limp mailbag Claude , Herb 's brother , held out to him . " Hi there , Johnny ! " Herb called . " What happened to Hasper ? " " I told him I 'd get the mail . " " You must have a girl ! Or are you expecting something from the catalogue ? " John grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooner spun on her heel and headed out to sea , he ran with the mailbag up the hill . Snow already covered the island , and the trees gnashed their bare branches together in the wind . John went to the small room over the garage which served as his father 's office . Bart was sitting there reading , a pale man now dressed in a worn lieutenant-commander 's uniform . He had taken to wearing his old uniforms during the winter and fall because , as he said , there was no one on the island to give a damn , and it was a shame to let warm clothing go to waste . The ribbons over his left breast showed he had served in the North Atlantic , the European theater , and the South Pacific . He had three battle stars and the Navy Cross . The two and a half gold stripes on his sleeves were worn to the color of silver , and as was usually true , he was a little drunk . Starting promptly at noon , Bart began to drink from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At five the cocktail hour started , and he drank Martinis until seven . The highballs began at eight-thirty and lasted until one in the morning , when Bart was able to go to sleep . He was n't a truly vicious alcoholic , as he analyzed himself aloud to Sylvia quite often . Only rarely was he stumbling , or thick-speeched or abusive . Usually he spaced his drinks pretty well , and was able to maintain an edge of saintly beatitide.  | Now there was a serene smile on his face when his son arrived with the mail . " Right on time , eh , Johnny ? " he said , and from a hook on the wall took a key , which , after considerable fumbling , he inserted in the padlock at the neck of the mailbag . Lifting the bag higher than necessary , he spilled the mail on the floor . There were a week 's copies of the Wall Street Journal and three appeals from charities for Bart , as well as a dozen bills , which he put aside for Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hasper in the almost illegible , spidery scrawl of his ninety-year-old mother , who lived in Harvesport , and who wrote him once a week , winter and summer , despite the fact she never got an answer . There was an advertisement from a shop called " My Lady 's Hat " for Sylvia , and in the midst of all this were two light-blue envelopes from Palm River , Florida , one addressed to John in a large , still-childish scrawl , and the other expertly typed to Bart . Bart handed John his letter without comment , and the boy took it to his room . Bart was glad to be alone  --  for many months now , he had been developing a sense of annoyance when anyone was in the room with him . He opened his letter from Ken with curiosity . DEAR BART , While down here in Palm River , Florida , for a vacation , I ran into a good investment opportunity : a small motel on the beach . These establishments are apparently very profitable and offer certain tax advantages to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate them . The thought occurred to me that you and Sylvia might be interested in entering into the venture with me as partners . I 'll put up the money if you 'll supply the administrative ability and professional skills necessary for running such a place . The usual arrangement is for the manager and his wife to be supplied an apartment and a suitable salary or percentage of profits . Helen and I have acquired a house nearby which I hope to get down to for vacations , but for the most part , the entire responsibility would be yours . I enclose a photograph of the establishment , and I ca n't tell you how grateful I would be if this appealed to you . I 'm sure that we could reach agreement on details if you cared to come down and talk it over . While in New York a few weeks ago , I ordered a car which is supposed to arrive from Italy soon , and I would count it as another great favor if you drove it down with your family . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes ages .  | Perhaps this is presumptuous of me , but I thought it worth a try . Sincerely , KEN Bart read this with a thin smile on his lips . Holding the letter in his hand , he went to the bedroom , where Sylvia was making a dress on an old-fashioned foot-treadle sewing machine . She looked up sharply when he came in , and brushed her hair back from her forehead . " What have you got there ? " she asked . He put it on the pink cotton material before her and said nothing . She read it slowly , her face grave . Then she handed it back to him . " What do you think of it ? " she asked . Bart smiled . " Sylvia , there is an old joke with the tag line , ' I may be crazy , but I 'm not stupid . ' I think that applies to me . " Her face showed no sign of emotion , except that her eyes seemed to widen a little . " No one said you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Ken , " he said quietly . She bowed her head . " You 've had another admirer for a long time , " Bart continued , his voice dry and ironic . " He knows more about you than you think . " " Who ? " " Our old friend . " " What old friend ? Do n't play cat and mouse with me , Bart ! " " Todd Hasper . Apparently you and Ken had difficulty sleeping last summer , and Hasper walks at night too . " There was a brief silence . " What a rotten way for you to find out , " she said finally . " Oh , I do n't know . It kind of brought Todd and me together . " " Stop it , Bart ! Do n't try to make this funny ! " His face was pale , and the mocking smile went . " I would n't for anything , " he said . " It seems that Todd has been a sort of distant admirer of yours , ever since you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you mean ? " " Todd is n't the most coherent man , but he said something about undressing in front of windows , and all sorts of rot . Evidently he 's made a lifetime study of you . He was n't a Peeping Tom , really , to hear him tell it . Just a scientist , a bird watcher , perhaps . And he used to have a certain admiration for you . " Sylvia closed her eyes . " I have no defense , " she said . " That surprises me. "  | " Except one . " " Ah . " " I 've grown up , Bart . I 've changed . " " You 're suggesting that we forget the past ? " " No . That we face the present . " " How ? " " I 'm in love with Ken . " " Very touching , " he said . " I ca n't live here on the island with you and the children . " " You want a divorce ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was standing very erect , an officer at attention , almost . " I appreciate your concern , " he said . " You know the truth about me , and I do n't deny it . Do n't deny the truth about yourself . " " And that is ? " " You ought to get off this island , Bart ! It 's no good here in the winter , for you or for any of us . " " But you are leaving and you want to take the children ? " " Yes . " " " I could make it dirty in the courts . I 'm the aggrieved party , the innocent one . " Bart twisted his lips into a parody of a smile . " I know . " " I think Todd would like to appear as a witness . He 's been brooding about this for a long time , and it seems to do him good to talk about it . " Sylvia put her hand over her eyes . " That would be fine for the children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If it comes to that , I could prove you 're an alcoholic , " she said in the low tones of despair . " Anyway , you do n't really want to keep the children here on the island yourself . " " It would prove a point . " " Yes . It would prove a point , but you 're not that bad . " " No , " he said . " Thank you for recognizing that . " " Why do n't you come to Florida with us ? " she said miserably . " I do n't want to leave you here alone . " " Really , " he said , assuming an air of detached amusement . " I 've lost money , dear , but I 'm not ready to be kept by Ken Jorgenson 's mistress . Or will it be his wife ? "  | " I do n't know . " " " I imagine you 'll have a fight with that woman , Helen . She 's not as reasonable as I. " " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm still perceptive , dear . She 's got a weapon . Your old Beast wo n't like losing his daughter . " " No . " " I do n't think he 'll ever marry you . " " Perhaps not . " " What I 'm trying to say is , " Bart said , slumping suddenly , as though someone had barked " At easel " " I 'm willing to let bygones be bygones if you care not to reply to this letter . " " No . " " I was afraid of that , " Bart said , his face looking tortured . " Most women do n't want to be forgiven . " " It has nothing to do with that . " " I 'll give you Carla , " he said , his voice flat . " I ca n't take care of her . " " And Johnny ? " " I would like to keep my son . " The tone was final , and not without dignity . " There 's not even a school for him ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll let your friend pay for that . " " How about his summers ? You 're not a fit father , Bart ! Any court would recognize that ! " " And what kind of a mother are you ? Would they want him brought up by Jorgenson 's mistress ? " Sylvia closed her eyes again . " I 'll make you a deal , " Bart said . " Take Carla , leave me Johnny , and I 'll spread no dirty linen in court . " Sylvia shook her head silently . " I ca n't leave you Johnny . " " Why not ? " " You 'd kill him . Remember . . . " Yes . I was drunk . But I 'll tell you this . I 'll send him to boarding school and summer camp . He 'll be here hardly ever . " " Then why do you want him ? " " He 'll still be my son . " " Pride , " she said . " If you wish to call it that . But in all truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Boarding school is best . "  | " That 's true , " Sylvia said hopelessly . " Oh , God , I guess that 's true . " " For Carla there 's no choice  --  she 's too young , " Bart continued soberly . " So you can take her . But John is mine , and I want him to stay mine . " " Can he visit me ? " " What is gone is best forgotten . " " I do n't believe that . " " I do . You 're going to do this my way . " " Let me see him sometimes ! It 's ridiculous to forbid that ! " " No , " he said . " You 'd try to get him back . I do n't want you even to speak to him about this without my being there . We 'll break the news to him together . " Putting her head on her arms , she began to sob . He stood looking down at her , and once he started to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abrupt about-face , his face drawn hard , and strode from the room . 12 " DEAR JOHN , " Molly wrote . " I am in Florida . We have a funny house colored green . The swimming is great , but the surf is much bigger than on the island . They have hurricanes sometimes , but none yet . Mother has been in Buffalo , but she 's coming tomorrow . I ca n't wait to see her face when I show her the Toad Fish I caught in the river . Daddy pickled it for me in a bottle of alcohol and it 's so ugly ! " There were four pages of observations of this kind , and the letter was signed , " Sincerely , Molly . " " Johnny 's getting love letters ! " Carla said . John blushed . " It 's nothing like that , " he replied indignantly . That night he wrote Molly the latest news about a seal that had been seen off the island . It was on a cold day that Barton Hunter , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's room over the garage on Pine  | Island at four-thirty in the afternoon . He found his son lying on the bed reading Tarzan and the Moon Maiden . " John , could you come into our room , please ? " Bart said in his perfectly enunciated tenor voice . " Your mother and I have something important to discuss with you . " " Sure , Dad , " John said . He put the Tarzan book under his pillow , where Carla would not be apt to find it , and followed his father down the hall . In the corner of his parents ' room he found Sylvia sitting in a small armchair . She was wearing a pale-blue dress she had recently made . As John entered , she took a cigarette from a case in her purse and put it in her mouth . When she struck a match it made a surprisingly sharp rasping sound . " We have something important to talk over with you , Son , " she said , and her eyes seemed to be pleading . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest of the twin beds , both of which were covered with white lace spreads he had inherited from his mother . " It 's not very good news , Son , " he said . " What is it ? " John asked . His mother 's perfume pervaded the room , lilac , and the scent of talcum powder . On Sylvia 's mirrored dressing table was a glass vase containing three red maple leaves . " Your mother and I are going to get a divorce , " Barton said . Sylvia struck another match and relit her cigarette . Except for the scraping sound , there was complete silence . " A divorce , " Barton repeated , thinking from John 's reticence that the boy did not understand . " Why ? " John asked . He stood erect near the door and his voice was steady . For a moment a stricken look flickered on Barton 's face , but then his voice acquired a curious tone of falseness . " People marry because they fall in love , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better for them to get unmarried . That is called a divorce . " " You 'll understand when you are older , " Sylvia said , her voice sounding strained . " Yes , " Barton said . Outside the window Hasper 's dog started to bark . " When ? " John asked . " When you get older , " Barton repeated . " No . When are you going to get the divorce ? "  | " Your mother is leaving this afternoon . " " This wo n't affect you much , John dear , " Sylvia said . " You 'll be going to boarding school soon . We 've made arrangements with a very good one . " John said nothing . " Your mother is going to take Carla with her , " Barton said . " I am hoping that you will stay with me when you 're not at school or camp . " John made a sound then , a sudden exhalation of breath , and turned toward his mother . She gave a forced smile . " Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " You 're taking Carla ? " " Yes . " The sudden dizzying thought that his mother had simply chosen the child she liked best swept over John , leaving him speechless . " You must n't take it hard , " Bart said nervously . " You and I will get on just fine together . " " And you can visit me someday , " Sylvia added . " No , " John said , the word barely audible . " What , dear ? " " Never ! " John said , his throat so tight he could barely get the word out . " Johnny ! " Sylvia said , getting up from her chair . " Do n't be like that , please ! " She put her arm around him , her bosom soft against his cheek . The scent of her perfume was overwhelming . Against his will he clung to her a moment , but then he pulled away . " There 's no reason to be sad , " she said . " When you 're older , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John made no sound , but he was crying , and he made a convulsive effort to stop , inhaling sharply , almost as though to suck the tears back . " We 'll have a good time together , you and I , " Barton ventured timidly . John stood mutely looking from one of his parents to the other . Then he whirled and ran down the hall to his room . He heard his mother scream , but kept running and locked his door . In time his tears stopped . There was no moisture in his eyes , and even his mouth and throat were dry . The sweet smell of his mother 's perfume seemed to follow him into his room and to permeate everything there , like the smell of funeral flowers .  | Suddenly he heard his mother 's footsteps and there was a knock on his door . He said nothing . " Johnny , " she said , " let me in . " Clenching his fists , he lay in silence . " Pleaser Sylvia said . A door slammed violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God damn it , leave him alone ! " Outside the window the sound of the surf pounding the cliffs was low and ominous . John turned on his back and lay staring at the ceiling . He was careful to make no sound . Let her think I 'm dead , he thought . Let her think I 'm dead . In the white plaster there was a long crack with many branches , like the map of a river , a river that would be fun to explore . Tarzan and the moon maiden might explore a river like that in a dugout canoe , and John might go with them , shooting the rapids with the black heads of the crocodiles bobbing in the white water , and wildcats screeching ashore . " Hold on , John ! " Tarzan would say . " Let 's go ! " the moon maiden would shout , sounding and looking like Molly . " We 're off to the mountains of the moon ! " Later John was awakened by the sound of an automobile door slamming , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . John was aware that his mother was leaving for the wharf , and the boat . There was the thought that this might not be true , that there would be another knock on his door , and she would be there in her blue dress , with the smell of perfume , but that did not happen . He thought of pursuing her , of running wildly after the car , but his pride stopped him . He lay rigid in bed and finally slept . Later he awakened with a start . The room was pitch black , and someone was pounding on his door . There was a moment of ringing silence , and then his father said , " John ! Let me in ! " John lay motionless , breathing hard , but did not answer . " Please ! " his father said . Still John did not answer . " John ! " Barton said with pleading in his voice . " Are you all right ? " " Yes , " John said . " I want to talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why not ? " There was desperation , not comfort , in Barton 's voice . " Because I want to be by myself , " John said in a monotone .  | " All right ! " his father said with anger , and there was the sound of his footsteps going down the stairs . John remained motionless in his bed in the darkness . The wind was rising outside , sighing through the naked branches of the trees , and the surf pounded . At three in the morning there was another knock on John 's door , followed by a guttural noise , almost an animal sound , the nature of which made John sit bolt upright in bed , trembling . Silence , and then the noise came again , half sob , half whisper , a wounded sound . John jumped to open the door , and his father , still in uniform , half fell into the room , catching himself on the bed , turning and smiling slowly in the dim light from the hall . Barton was crying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John 's breath stopped . He said nothing . " You and I , " Barton gasped , holding himself erect with sudden dignity . " Yes . " " We 're self . . . " There was a pause during which Barton appeared to be meditating deeply . " We 're self ... " he repeated , " we 're self-sufficient . " " Yes , " John said . His father turned and stretched out on his back on the bed . " Do n't need a woman , " he said . " No , " John replied . " No more arguments , " Barton continued . " No fights . No more being a goddamn cuckold . Do you know what that is ? " Barton put his fingers up to his head like a devil 's horns . " No , " John said . " You should n't know . Not at your age . " John said nothing . His father sighed . " Things happen to people , Johnny , " be said . " Even nice people . Someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you hear me ? " " Yes . " " Sylvia used to be a nice woman . I lost the money  --  all the goddamn money . Winner takes all , losers weepers . " " I guess so , " John said . " You ca n't keep a woman like that without money . Poverty is against her nature . She goes to the highest bidder . "  | No reply came from John . " Always plenty of takers for a woman like that , " Barton said . " Odd man out . " " Out , " John repeated without knowing what he was saying . " Shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations , " Bart said . " That 's me . You 're lucky . You can start all over again . " " Yes . " " Start up the ladder , boy . From the bottom up , not the top down . No , sir . Do you understand ? " " Yes , " John repeated . " Good . But that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit up on the bed . " The point is , " he said again , " the point is that you and I do n't have to worry . No worries . That 's absolutely final . " Swinging his legs over the side of the bed , he tried to stand up , but sank back again . " Give me a hand , will you , Son ? " he asked . John gave him a hand . He gripped his father 's arm and found it shockingly thin and weak . Barton struggled to his feet , slack-boned , leaning on his son 's shoulder , and said , " Thanks , Son . Must n't think I 'm a drunk , understand . Unusual circumstances tonight . Very unusual circumstances . Just give me a steer down the hall , and I 'll be all right . " Teetering down the hall with his father leaning upon him , John was astonished at his own strength . Always before he had imagined his father to be big , but now he found he could almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barton staggered toward his bed and , without undressing , collapsed . His face lying on the white lace counterpane was gray with the bones showing clearly through it , almost in the outline of a skull . His cheeks were still wet with tears . John covered him with a blanket , then put out the light and returned quietly to his own room . An hour later he heard his father get up and stumble to the office down the hall where he kept his liquor , but John did n't try to help him . Just before dawn John awoke , shivering violently . The room was very cold , and there was no sound but the steady sighing of the wind , the distant surf , and the whimper of Hasper 's dog . He went to Bart 's room and saw his father lying motionless and uncovered , with both arms flung back , and his mouth open . A quart bottle of whisky lay beside him , leaving the sheet stained where it had spilled . Stricken  | with the fear that his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately to catch the sound of his breath , but there was nothing that could be heard above the sound of the wind and the dog . " Dad ! " he said , flinging himself in panic upon Bart . " Dad ! Wake up ! " Bart remained inert , but he groaned , and grateful for even that sign of life , John gave up trying to arouse him . After covering his father with a quilt , he stood at the foot of his mother 's empty bed , shivering . Of course , he thought , the heater must have gone out , that is why it is so cold . Finding some matches on the bedside table , he tried to light the stove again , but the wick would n't catch . Discovering that the tank was empty , John went outside , pushing the door open against the wind , and got a five-gallon tin of kerosene from the bottom section of the garage . When he came back to his father 's room , he found Bart lying with his position unchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved to see that he was breathing . After getting the stove going , he went back to his room and fell asleep . It was almost noon when John awoke , but the light in the room was dim , and sleet was rattling against the windowpanes . Running to his father 's room , he saw that Bart had turned over in the night , and was now lying on his stomach with his face in the pillow , so that there was no way to tell if he was alive . " Dad ! " he called . " Dad ! It 's time to wake up ! " Bart did n't stir . John seized his shoulders and turned him over . Bart opened his eyes , and his head lolled back weakly . " Let alone , " he said thickly , and groped for the bottle . Finding it was empty , he produced a full one from beneath the covers . John went to the kitchen , where he cooked himself toast and bacon , and drank a glass of milk . He cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he lay on his bed all day reading his Tarzan books . Every hour or so he checked on his father , but Bart had apparently fallen into a coma . Shortly after six o'clock John heard his father groan . Running to his room , he saw that Bart had vomited , and that his eyelids were fluttering oddly . In panic John rushed outside to get Todd Hasper . It was bitter cold , and he clutched the collar of his coat around his neck as he ran . The sleet had left a brittle crust over the snow , which cracked like glass as John ran over it . Smoke was coming from the chimney of  | Hasper 's cottage , he was glad to see  --  he had had a dread that on this day of nightmares even Hasper would be dead or missing . When he pounded on the door there was no answer . He opened it , and suddenly the dog was upon him , knocking him to the ground . Todd Hasper , dressed only in long woolen underwear , appeared simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling , with his collar and coat badly ripped . " Dad 's sick , " he said . " Ha ! " Hasper retorted . " You hurt ? " He chained the dog to a ring in the wall at the far side of the room . " No , but hurry ! " " He 'll still be there , " Hasper said , drawing on his trousers . " He ai n't going no place . " On the way to the garage Hasper refused to run , and they trudged slowly over the splitting ice crust . The odor in Bart 's room was sickening . Hasper leaned over Bart and turned him on his back . Bart opened his eyes , which looked yellow , and made an effort to smile . " Sick , " he said , his voice barely audible . " We 'll get the Coast Guard and send him to the hospital , " Hasper said to John in matter-of-fact tones . " You can stay with me . " " No , " Bart whispered . " Johnny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few inches from his father 's . " Go to your mother , address and money in my office . " " I want to help you ! " " Hospital . Go to Mother . Come back later , when I 'm better . " With Hasper , John drove in the old Ford to the south end of the island . Balancing themselves carefully on the icy ground , they carried two five-gallon cans of kerosene to a finger of rock extending into the bay nearest the mainland . They wet down a space about fifty feet square with the kerosene , and standing back , Todd casually lit a ball of paper with a match and tossed it into the center of the area . There was a flash , and for about five minutes the flames burned brightly . When they went out , Todd stared into the darkness toward the mainland where only a'few dim lights could be seen . Without comment , he went back to the car and got more kerosene . They had to repeat the performance twice before a signal light blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hasper said , and they returned to the garage . Three hours later a Coast Guard picket boat arrived , and two cheerful young bluejackets , their faces full of concern , put Bart on a stretcher and loaded him aboard . John accompanied his father to  | the doors of the hospital . Bart was able to smile when he left and to say , " Do n't worry about me  --  Navy will take care . " From Harvesport John telephoned his mother , reaching her soon after she arrived at the Seaside Motel in Palm River . In rigidly calm , almost formal tones , he told her what had happened . " Oh , Johnny ! " she said . " I 'll come get you ! " " I can come alone ! " " Are you sure ? " " Of course , " he said , and his high boy 's voice was curiously stern . " Johnny , are you all right ? " she asked hoarsely , and he was filled with the sudden horror that he was going to cry there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he were crawling , coming on his belly to his mother who had abandoned him , and he said , " Yes , I 'm all right ! I 'm just coming to you to get money ! " When John got off the plane at Palm River twelve hours later , Sylvia ran to embrace him , but he stood stiffly as a soldier at attention , and he did not kiss her back . " Oh Johnny ! " she said , stroking his cheek with her hand . " Do n't be like that ! " A muscle under the skin of his cheek flickered . " I 'm glad to see you , Mother , " he said , his voice tightly controlled . " I 'm sorry that I have to bother you like this . " Wearily she turned , and gripping his hand tightly , led him to her car , a new Ford Ken had had waiting at the motel for her . When they got in it , she put both hands around John 's neck and tried to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back violently with his eyes blazing and said , " No ! " " You do n't have to hate me , " she said in a soft voice . " That does n't do any good . " " I want to go to boarding school , " he said , his fists clenched . " You can if you want . But there 's a good school here I 'd like you to attend for a while first . " " Have it your way ! " he said , and bending over , averted his face because the tears were beginning to come . He crouched there in the car covering his face with his hands , but when she tried to comfort him he turned on her in agony and said , " Leave me alone ! All I want is to be left alone ! " A stout woman leading a child by the hand peered into the car curiously as she passed . Sylvia started the engine and drove slowly to the Seaside Motel , a small barrackslike building of white stucco on  | the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in . Carrying his suitcase , John followed her . Carla was helping a colored maid to fold newly ironed sheets . When she saw John she ran toward him with her chubby arms out , but he turned away from her , too , this girl whom his mother had preferred to him . " Nice to see you , Carla , " he said , his voice bitter . " How have you been ? " " All right , " she said , letting her arms fall to her sides . " What 's the matter , Johnny ? Are you mad at me ? " " No ! " he said . " Nothing 's the matter ! Nothing , nothing , nothing ! " Tears were starting to come again . Leaving his suitcase in the middle of the room , he bolted out the door . The dry sand near the dunes was soft , and the wind sent it up like puffs of smoke from his feet . Possessed , he ran as fast as he could , zigzagging in crazy pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch them and perhaps rend them as they wheeled past his shoulders . Exhausted , he finally sank down on a log and sat there with his breath rasping out in hot gasps . The wind from the sea was strong , and the breakers curled in endless rows flashing in the sun . He rested for ten minutes and then for the first time stood up and looked around . The Seaside Motel stood alone on the dunes beyond the city boundaries of Palm River . To the south of it , several houses had recently been built a thousand yards up the beach , and beyond them an almost unbroken row of cottages began . In the other direction , the beach and dunes were deserted , all the way to the inlet , which was now barely visible in a blaze of reflected sun . John put his hand to his eyes and it was then he saw a girl walking down the beach toward him , barefoot at the very edge of the sea , a slender girl in blue dungarees rolled up to the knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was leaning forward with her eyes cast down , and she was walking slowly , looking forlorn against the background of the pounding surf . Although they did not recognize each other , there was a feeling inherent in the wind on that barren beach which drew them together as though they had met on a desert , and she changed her direction toward him as he started walking to her . When John got about a hundred feet from her , he realized she was Molly , and he stopped , suddenly confused . " Hello , Molly , " he said . She was hurt because he did not seem more glad to see her , and the memory of the letters they had exchanged suddenly embarrassed her ; perhaps he thought she had been trying to write him love letters ,  | or something . " Hello , " she said in guarded tones . " I heard you were coming . " " Where do you live ? " he asked . She gestured down the beach toward one of the houses which had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wind was whipping her long dark hair , and she brushed it back impatiently . Her face was tan , and so were her arms , her long , coltish legs , and her feet . Suddenly she bent over , darted a hand into the sand , and picked up a dark brown object , shiny as a chestnut , but flatter and larger . " What 's that ? " John asked . " A sea heart , " she said , turning it over in her hand . " I am collecting them . " " May I see it ? " She handed it to him and he inspected it with interest . It was as smooth as though it had been varnished , and was indeed shaped roughly like a heart . " Do they grow in the sea ? " he asked . " No , " she said seriously . " Daddy says they grow in Africa or South America or some place and float over . " The wind blew a strand of dark hair across her lips , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and she polished it on the rolledup sleeve of her shirt . " I collect all kinds of things on the beach , " she said , her voice sounding almost academic . " Coquina shells make good necklaces  --  they come in every shade of every color . There are even striped ones . Look ! " She darted her hand into the sand again , and came up with a palepink shell shaped like a fan . " I do n't know what this one is yet , but I can look it up in a book . " " It 's a nice one , " John said . " I 'd like to learn about shells . " " There are more than shells to find , " she said . " There are sea beans , some brown , some gray . There are things that fall overboard from ships . Daddy heard of somebody once who found a bottle with a message in it . " " It would be fun to find a bottle with a message , " John said enthusiastically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . " My mother says you have to be terribly careful on the beach . " " Why ? " " There are jellyfish and Portuguese men of war which sting . They look like little blue balloons , but they have poison in them , and long  | tentacles which float out all around them , and if you touch one in the water , you might drown . " " I 'll stay away from them , " John said . " Then of course there 's the sun , " she continued , speaking faster , but still looking down . " People die from sunburn sometimes . And there 's the undertow  --  several people are drowned on this beach every year . There are sharks and barracuda in the water , and do n't go near the coral reef , because the Moray eels live there . " " What are they ? " John asked in astonishment . " Big eels with teeth , " she said . " Their bite is poisonous or something . And there are sting rays with poisonous tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " John said . Suddenly Molly glanced up at him and he found himself looking directly into her startlingly light blue eyes . " They always try to scare people about the beach , " she said . " Daddy says that whenever anybody new comes , the old ones try to scare him . We do n't know why . " " I 'm not scared , " John said . Molly smiled . " I 've got to get home now , " she said , and before he could reply she stepped quickly past him and started running along the very edge of the sea toward her house , with the surf reaching up and erasing her footprints behind her , so that she appeared to be skimming six inches above the earth , leaving no trace of her passage . In front of her the sandpipers scattered , and gulls wheeled around her head . John watched her out of sight . Then he glanced down and saw that she had dropped the sea heart at his feet . 13 HELEN JORGENSON , looking thinner than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back which exposed too much of her spine , clearly outlined beneath her tanned skin , walked into the drugstore in the shopping center near her house , and giving the clerk a twentydollar bill , asked to have it broken into quarters and dimes.  | " All of it ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said . " I have to make a long-distance phone call . " Going to a telephone booth , she inserted a dime from her purse , and dialed the operator . " I want to place a long-distance call to Buffalo , New York , " she said , and gave the number . It took ten minutes to get the call through , and the telephone booth was hot with the door shut . Finally she heard a buzzing , and her mother 's voice said , " Hello ? " " Motherl " Helen said . " Helen , dear , is everything all right ? " " It 's about Ken . You know , Mother , you were right . He is having an affair with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that from the beginning , " Margaret snapped . " As soon as you told me he was having her down there , I knew it . " " Well , it 's absolutely fantastic , " Helen said . " I could n't believe it at first . I mean , last summer there was a lot of talk , but you know , he 's never been the type . " " Does he know that you know it ? " " Not yet . " " How did you find out ? " " Well , it was strange/ Last Sunday he told me he was going fishing . He 's been doing that a lot lately , and I thought it was queer , because you know in Buffalo he never did it  --  he never thought of going fishing . Well , he went off with his pole and his bait and all that , the way he always does down here , and Minnie Apton saw them . " " Who 's Minnie Apton ? " " You know , she 's that nice woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club . " " Would she act as a witness ? " " Gosh , I do n't know . I never thought of that . Anyway , she and Jack  --  that 's her husband  --  and their children wanted to go swimming , some place away from the crowds . There 's an awfully trashy element corning in down here now , you know  --  sometimes it 's just disgusting on the beach . Well , anyway , Minnie and Jack decided to go way north , about a mile from here , where they could have some privacy , and she saw Ken . He was with her . They were behind the dunes , mind you , not on the beach . " " What were they doing ? " " Oh , they were just talking . " " Oh . " Margaret 's disappointment was clear .  | " But you know what that means . When he came home , I asked him how the fishing was , and he said he did n't have much luck . I mean , if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie to me ? " " Of course he 's having an affair with herl But to get a divorce , you 've got to catch them doing more than talking . " " He 'd give me a divorce , Mother , if I asked him . I told you that . " " Now do n't start that again . Your father has talked to a lawyer , and we have to be very careful . If it ever appeared that it was you who wanted the divorce , we would n't get half as much , not a third . " " But he never has been bad about money . All right , operator , I do n't care  --  I 've got plenty of change here . " " What 's that , dear ? " Margaret asked . " The operator said the three minutes are up . Now , Mother , I think I should just tell him . I do n't think he 'd even deny it , and then it would be just the same for the lawyers as if we caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Margaret said in exasperation . " I 'm telling you , dear , the lawyer said men act differently in circumstances like these than at any other time . He might deny it , and if you told him you knew , you would be giving him warning , and they 'd be much harder to catch . They might even break off altogether for a long time . " " I suppose that 's true , " Helen said . " Does he still want to  --  you know  --  with you ? " " Nol " Helen said . " He has n't for ages . " " Well , do n't refuse him . The lawyer says you have to be willing to be his wife , to avoid a nasty countersuit . " " Motherl You did n't talk about thatl " Helen sounded aghast . " Why , dear , that 's what lawyers are for . They 're like doctors . " " I 'd be so embarrassed if I met himl " " You have nothing to be embarrassed about . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even talking about itl " " Lawyers hear that sort of thing often . And he said that in Florida that might be grounds for divorce . I mean Ken might be able to get one from you , for refusing for a long time , if it all came out in the courts , and you might not be able to get anything from him . It could be very dirty . And if Molly said she wanted to stay with him , I mean a girl that age , why they even might let herl " There was a brief but pregnant silence .  | " I can see we have to be careful , " Helen said . " But you must n't refuse him any morel I know it sounds terrible , but it 's important/ " " Mother ! " " Well , there 's no way around it . It 's the law . If you 're a man 's wife ... " " Mother ! We do n't have to talk about it , anyway . He never asks me any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , a great deal is at stake here , dear . If you could prove that you 'd been willing ... But , of course , if we could catch them and had a witness , none of that would have to come up . He could bring countersuit , but the lawyer says he would n't have a chance . We 've got to catch them . " " How ? " " Now listen , dear . Your father and I have been talking . How would you like us to come down and help you out ? " " But Daddy 's jobl " " He 's almost ready to retire anyway , and he has a month 's vacation due . We 'd be willing if you want us . " " Of course , I 'd love itl " Helen said . " We could help you . This can be a nasty business : hiring detectives and all that . You need our help . " " Yes , " Helen said . " Mother , you 're a wonder ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " By the way , how 's Molly ? " " She 's still seeing that boy all the time . That 's another fantastic part of this . Ken seems to think I 'm wicked when I try to warn her , or keep her home . " " It 's fantastic , all right , " Margaret replied . " But if we play our cards right , we wo n't have to worry . See you Wednesday , about noon . Will he mind our coming ? " " Oh , I can handle him , " Helen said . They said goodbye with great affection , and Margaret hung up . It took quite a long while to feed the machine enough quarters and dimes.  | 14 PALM RrvER , Florida , was a paradise for bicycle riders . A bankrupt real-estate development called Garden Heights , which had been started in 1927 , stretched through the palmetto jungles , the concrete roads crumbling and split by weeds , but still passable . There were almost eight miles of roads crisscrossing each other in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but few houses , no traffic and no people . The reason was that the Garden Heights Development Corporation had gone broke in 1929 , and had traveled through so many bankruptcy courts , inheritance squabbles , attachments , and other legal entanglements that it was cheaper for laterday real-estate speculators to clear the almost limitless palmetto scrub land with bulldozers and start afresh than to bring to realization the tarnished dreams of their predecessors . These old roads usually began at a fancy gate with an arch of rusting iron proudly proclaiming Hillside Avenue or Oceanview Terrace and they ran through acres of pine and palmetto waste across the flat Florida landscape , where the buzzards perched solemnly in the few tall trees and the quail whistled in the underbrush . Rattlesnakes and an occasional coral snake sunned themselves on the warm concrete , and mourning doves cooed from the crossbars of rotting telephone posts . Down these empty roads with tall , bright-blossomed weeds growing in the cracks , Molly and John at the ages of fourteen and fifteen sped on bicycles as though they were the only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts had had ornate shades of milk glass , but most of these had been broken by boys with slingshots , and presented only jagged edges to the sky . In a clearing choked with high grass they came upon an old mansion built as a sample and abandoned by its owners . Too isolated , too big and too dilapidated to be reconditioned , it had been rotting for years . Feeling that eyes were upon them , they pried open a broken window , crawled in and wandered through the dusty rooms . In a bureau drawer John found an old golf ball with the white cover brittle and cracked , and they marveled at the tightly wound rubber inside , an elastic a thousand miles long , they guessed , if it could only be stretched out without being broken . On a window sill near an old-fashioned mahogany table Molly spied  | a lizard , a perfect alligator in miniature , only sleek and striped with green and brown , crouched to gobble flies caught in spiderwebs . In the cellar they found a tattered pool table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving tracks on the dusty , disintegrating felt . Tiring of this , they fished from the bridges which crossed the inland water route to Miami , in which Palm River formed a link . Negroes in faded blue shirts fished for their dinner beside them . Occasionally there was a loud blare from an air horn , three blasts in succession , and the bridges opened to allow a stately yacht from Detroit or Chicago , New York or Boston to pass . The children and the Negroes on the bridge usually waved at the people on the yachts , and the yachtsmen often waved back . Some of the yachts tied up at the Palm River Municipal Docks , where Molly and John often went . Aboard one shiny houseboat lived a beautiful woman with her hair dyed lavender and a lavender wolfhound to match . She walked her dog along a path beside the river every evening , sometimes accompanied by a fat old man with a yachting cap and a cigar . Molly and John met them several times and accepted them as a matter of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen at the Municipal Docks . There was a man living with his wife and two children aboard a dwarfed four-masted schooner he had built himself in Ohio and had trucked to the nearest water , in hopes of sailing around the world . He started every month on his magnificent voyage but invariably ran aground or broke down before leaving the inland waterway , and had to put back for repairs . There was an old man with a grand piano built into his tiny motor cruiser , taking up the whole cabin , with a bunk on top of it , and storage lockers under it , but just the piano in the cabin , and no room for anything around it . This man lived on top of his piano and under it , and he anchored out in the river alone playing Beethoven sonatas late at night . He said he lived on a dollar a day sent to him by his daughter , and the fish he could catch , and that he had enough cash left over to send his grandchildren Christmas presents every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told them to be sure to learn to play a musical instrument , there was nothing more important in life . John delighted him by playing his piano well . On the beach in downtown Palm River were great hotels with floor shows brought in from New York and kidney-shaped swimming  | pools lying jade in the sun , but John and Molly rarely saw those . They rode their bicycles in the depression-haunted jungles , and they explored the river in an old Barnegat Bay sneakbox that Ken bought to teach his daughter how to sail , because he said he thought that was a skill all children should acquire young . The Oyster was the boat 's name , and they thought her prettier even than the big schooner , the Fairy Queen , aboard which John had first seen Molly . At first Ken and Sylvia were very careful about allowing the children to use the boat . They were permitted to sail only in the narrow part of the river , within sight of the boathouse , and a servant from Molly 's household was posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their competence , however , the watch was relaxed , and they were allowed to go around the bend , where the river offered more room for sailing . There was , as Ken pointed out to Helen , little danger for , outside the dredged channel , Palm River was shallow , and if they capsized , all they would have to do was to hang onto the boat until she drifted to a place where they could crawl through the mud and get ashore . Even this freedom , however , did not satisfy them . There was always another bend in the river which they wanted to see around ; the curiosity of explorers got into them . They had never seen a chart and were only dimly aware that such things existed . The river was as new to them as though it had never been sailed before , and as far as they were concerned , anything could exist beyond the place where they could see . It is conceivable that the trouble might never have happened if Ken had not bought the boat , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife and her parents , been adamant in giving the children permission to go on an all-day exploration and picnic . Old Bruce Carter , who spent most of his days in Florida silently rubbing his car in the driveway of Ken 's house , was convinced that the river was a place of great danger , full of alligators , sharks and God knew what else , including sewage and germs of all kinds , and as he told Ken , he washed his hands of the situation . Margaret , his wife , said that she might be old-fashioned , and she did n't want to be a prying mother-in-law , but in her day , fourteen-year-old girls were n't allowed to spend the day with boys in boats without chaperones . " They 're old enough , " she said several times . " You 've got to remember that they 're old enough to get in all kinds of trouble . " Helen echoed her parents ' sentiments . As far as she could see , Ken was subjecting Molly to a variety of perils that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had always had that mulelike streak in him , and he would n't pay a bit of attention to a word they said . So late in December the permission was given , and the day was set to take advantage of the New Year holiday from school . The trouble might have been less if Ken had not had to go to Paris . That was coincidence , of course  --  a circumstance that could have happened at any time , but that happened then . Bernie Anderson 's plans for a new development corporation were proceeding faster than he had anticipated . He had met businessmen in Paris who were willing to invest money in it as a sideline ; the deal was going to be a spare-time project for everyone concerned except a small staff which was to be hired , and Bernie himself . Some of the prospective investors wanted to take advantage of the long New Year weekend to bring together a lot of busy people from New York who might be interested , and Bernie wanted Ken to fly to Paris for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he should not go , so Ken agreed . Before he left , he told Molly to be careful on the voyage , and to remember all the details so she could tell him when he got back . The Saturday for which the children 's expedition had been planned dawned clear and , for Florida , quite cold . A " norther " was blowing , but in the narrow part of the river near the boathouse its weight was not fully felt . At eight in the morning Molly and John stowed their picnic boxes under the deck , hoisted the sail , and went flying down the channel dead before the wind , with the boat rolling and tossing her boom up in perfect expression of their exhilaration . Within an hour they reached the bend around which they had never . seen . As the familiar landmarks dropped astern , they observed that the river ahead of them became narrower and more crooked . The water was interlaced with small marsh islands , and swampy areas where white herons fished in the tall green grass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red-winged blackbirds scattered like a handful of stones before the boat . Although the wind blew harder as the day wore on , the surface of the river lay black in the confinement of the marsh , and as they rushed along , their wake stretched out astern like a path of suds . At ten in the morning they came upon a drawbridge , and exercising the right of all craft , however small , they bravely blew three blasts on a mouth horn and forced an old man to labor mightily on a huge crank to open it . He stood staring mournfully down at them as they swept majestically  | through , and squirted a brown stream of tobacco juice into their wake . They had planned to turn back at noon , but at eleven-thirty they sailed into a broad estuary , across which land could be only dimly seen . " I think there are big islands over there , " John said . " We ought to start home , " Molly replied . " I 'd just like to sail out enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " she said . On they went with the seas becoming larger as they drew away from the shore . The old sneakbox rolled wildly , and it took an alert eye and both hands on the tiller to prevent her from jibing . When they were about a quarter of the way across the bay , the islands ahead seemed to materialize into a headland , but it was hard to be sure . Plunging down an especially high wave , the sneakbox dug her blunt bow under , and shoveled a bucketful of water into the cockpit . " I think we ought to go back , " Molly said nervously . Her shirt was wet with spray , and she looked cold . " Just a minute , " John said . " I can almost see .. They passed a channel post and noticed that a strong tide was running with the wind . It 's going to be tough to beat back against this , he thought , but was stubborn and held on . Ahead of them stretched more channel posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dredge which had deepened the channel , low and without vegetation . On they rushed until they could see clearly that a big point of land cut across the estuary ahead of them . " I wonder what 's on the other side of that , " John said . " I do n't know , " she replied , glancing worriedly at the sky . " It 's getting cloudy , and I think we ought to start home . " Reluctantly he agreed . They carne about , and immediately found that running before it , they had underestimated the force of the gale . On the wind , the old sneakbox lay pounding heavily . John started the sheet and left the mainsail almost empty . Spray drenched them , and in spite of all they could do , enough water slopped into the cockpit to keep Molly busy with a bucket . She glanced over her shoulder at him , and he saw that her face was pinched with fear . " We 'll be all right , " he said , but as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide was sweeping them sideways , and that they were making little progress . For perhaps an hour they tacked back and forth near the same channel marker , while the sun grew lower  | In the sky and the clouds grew darker . The water became roiled with nnid , and in the worst puffs of wind , the surface of the waves took on a curiously tawny color . The luffing sail made an ominous thundering noise . At about four in the afternoon a gust flattened them , and they capsized , suddenly finding themselves clinging to the overturned boat with the water up to their necks . The old sneakbox floated like a low-lying raft . " Now what do we do ? " Molly asked breathlessly . With the sail in the water it seemed strangely quiet . The waves slopped against the hull , and the water was warmer than the air . " We hang on , " John said grimly . " We must n't try to swim to shore . " " We could n't , " she said , staring around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible . " With this wind and tide well drift fast , " he said . " Are you tired ? " " I can hang on . " " Look at that channel marker , " he said . " You can see we 're moving by it . " He crawled closer to her and put his arm around her thin shoulders to help her hang on . " When it gets dark , they 'll come looking for us , " he said . For about an hour they clung there , their bodies warm in the water , brit their arms and shoulders chilled in the wind . " Are there alligators here ? " she asked . " They do n't bite people . Only crocodiles do , and they 're different . " " Sharks ? " " They do n't come up rivers like this . " Finally they saw that they were drifting down on one of the sand spits cast up by the dredge . Suddenly his feet touched soft mud , barely thicker than the water . " Maybe we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Let 's swim in and rest first . " " No , wait till we drift in . It 's still farther than it looks , and we could n't walk in this stuff . " " Will there be alligators ? " she asked . " They do n't bite people , " he said . Quietly they waited until the boat carne to rest in the soft gray mud . Half swimming and half crawling , they made their way to the sand spit , pulling themselves out on their stomachs as though they themselves were alligators . The place smelled of seaweed and sewage . Above the waterline the sand was firm , and they stood up ,  | shivering in the wind , but delighted to be on their feet . The sand spit was about thirty feet wide , a hundred feet long , and only about two feet above the water in the center . The gray sand was covered with broken white shells . " I 'm freezing , " Molly said . " We could haul the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a tent from the sail . " Caught on the bottom and flooded with water , the boat would not budge , and John realized that it would be impossible to move her even if he could get footing in the mud . Quickly they removed the sails and spars and contrived a rough tent in the very center of the island . Splashing back and forth from the boat , even their heads became covered with mud , but they found their water bottle and a can of corned beef hash . " I wish we could build a fire , " she said . " Me too . " But of course everything was wet , matches included . Huddled in the shelter of their improvised tent , they ate and drank . By that time the sun was setting , and it was very cold . Molly 's teeth were chattering . Only the surface of the sand was warm . " Maybe if we dug a hollow it would be better , " John said . Immediately they set to work , scooping up the broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand still retained the warmth of the sun . John cut his hand on a sharp shell , and sucked the blood . " Let 's get the paddle and dig with that , " Molly said . Emerging from the tent , they saw that the tide was receding , leaving the boat stuck in the mud . The paddle was nowhere in sight , but a loose floor board had drifted in , and they dug with that . In a few minutes they made a long hollow like a shallow grave . Wrapping themselves in the jib , which had partly dried , they lay down together and covered themselves with warm sand . The delivery from the cold was delicious . " I 'm sorry I turned the boat over , " he said . " It was my fault . " " It 's all right , " she said , snugglirrg her thin , mud-soaked body against him drowsily . " They 'll be along to pick us up soon . " " Still cold ? " he asked . " No " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen stalking the mud flats around them , The tide continued to go out , expanding their island to the very edge of the channel . John had n't realized the tide went out so far . I wonder how high it will get  | when it comes in , he thought . The idea struck him that perhaps their tiny island would be awash at high tide ; perhaps it had been only half tide when they arrived . But no , he thought ; the sand would not be so warm if it had not been lying all day in the sun . Maybe , he thought . Why does n't anything grow on this place ? How deep could the water get here at high tide ? We could cling to the boat again , he thought . Help will be here before long . They 'll miss us and go searching . Glancing down , he saw that Molly had gone to sleep , with her cheek resting peacefully against his shoulder . On the distant shore that night the lights of cars could be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and green lights of a bridge glimmered . There was no sound but the lapping of the waves and the occasional screech of a bird . With Molly against him in their gravelike place , it was warm . He put his head down and went to sleep . At about midnight the Coast Guard found them there . They were so exhausted that they did not awake when the searchlight swept by their tent . The first thing they knew , a sailor in rubber boots shook them and said , " Get upl Are you all right ? Good God , you kids sure need a bathl " Sylvia , Helen and Margaret were aboard the Coast Guard picket boat . Sylvia smiled with relief when she saw them , but Helen and Margaret were furious . Margaret grabbed Molly 's shoulder the moment the sailor set her down on the deck and said , " What do you mean , staying out so late ? What have you been doing ? " " We capsized , " Molly said . " You do n't have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , glaring at Sylvia . " Like mother , like son . " " Stop it , " Sylvia said , aghast . " Do n't talk like that to the childrenl " Molly and John stared at each other dully , too exhausted to think , but not to record what they heard to be dimly remembered later . The next day Molly did not show up in front of her house at her usual time . Instead , old Bruce appeared . His skin had not tanned even during hours of polishing his car in the Florida sun , and he had a nervous habit of scratching himself on the seat of the pants . " Come here , " he said to John , in an attempt to sound friendly . " What do you want ? " John asked , immediately suspicious . " I want to talk to you . " Diffidently John went to him . " About yesterday , " Bruce said .  | " What about it ? " " You can tell me , " Bruce said . " We men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " About what ? " " What did you do , you two out on the island ? You 're old enough . " John said nothing . " Her mother has to know , " Bruce said . John ran , and Bruce started after him , but the lithe boy outdistanced him with no difficulty . John returned to the motel , and with sobs bottled in his throat , burst in the front door of his mother 's apartment surprising a colored woman on her knees scrubbing the tiles . " What 's the matter , honey ? " she asked . " Nothing ! " John said . Rushing to his room , he threw himself on his bed and sobbed as though to mourn the end of all innocence . 15 Tim NEXT DAY Molly showed up on the beach in front of her house at dusk . She looked almost as she always did that year , a slender girl , quick to smile and quick to frown , but now her fists were clenched , and on her face was the deathlike look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John when he ran to meet her . " Are you all right ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said and sat down on the sand . He sank down beside her , and the ocean looked black beyond the white line of the crashing breakers which still gleamed in the last rays of the sun . " She wo n't let me see you any more , " Molly said . " Why not ? " Molly shrugged , a quick emphatic gesture that was to become characteristic , but she said nothing . " I 'll see you anyway , " he said . Molly was staring down with her face turned from him . " Mother says that my father and your ... " " What ? "  | " Mother , " she said . " A doctor ... I ca n't ... " ' there was a moment of silence during which they sat stricken by the terrible helplessness of childhood . A kind of shudder went through Molly 's body . At length , without saying anything , she shrugged again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veiled behind streaks of dark clouds . It was about a half hour afterward that they heard , faint in the wind , the voice of someone calling . " What 's that ? " he asked . " Her , " she said . They sat still while the word in the wind grew louder , clearly resolving itself into " Molly , " Helen 's voice full of anxiety and anger . John glanced at Molly and in the dim light from the moon saw she was smiling . " I 've got to go , " she said . " Tell . her you have n't seen me . " Before John could answer , Molly was on her feet , running down the beach away from the voice and her home . John got up to follow her , but she seemed to dissolve into the night , and after a few minutes he stopped and turned around . Way down the beach he saw a flashlight bobbing , and the voice borne on the wind was clear . " Molly , Mollyl " Helen was calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his sides , his body bent forward , stalking , unconsciously stalking , not running , for the first time in his life . " Molly , Molly ! " Helen kept calling . When John was about fifty feet from her , she saw him outlined against the sky , a tall fifteen-year-old boy , broad-shouldered , thick of chest , and already muscular of arm , a shadow in the night . " Who 's that ? " Helen called . He said nothing . " Molly , is that you ? " John walked toward her quietly , his feet making no noise on the rand . Helen shone the flashlight in his face . " Ah , " she said , " it 's yowl 1 should have known ! " " Now you , Mrs. Jorgenson ! " he said , his boy 's voice suddenly shrill in the night , high but commanding , a trumpet note . " What ? " A gasp of astonishment . " Do n't you hurt herl " he said . " Do n't you hurt her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're mad , " she said , turning and running . " A crazy boy from a crazy family ! " He stood , his arms still slack at his sides , looking after her , watching  | the flashlight go bobbing erratically down the beach . Then he turned and walked back to the motel . " Sit down for supper , Johnny , " Sylvia said when he got there . " You 're late . " He sat down in the corner of the dining room of the small apartment and took a spoonful of heavy bean soup . He had half finished it when the young Negro who served as an attendant at the motel came and said something to Sylvia in a low voice . " Tell her I 'll call her back , " Sylvia said . " But she said it was urgent , ma'am . " " All right . " Sylvia left the table . A moment later she came back , looking distraught , moving the fingers of both hands convulsively . " Son , come to my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small living room . As they climbed the stairs to her bedroom , he ran his hand along the railing , trying to think only of the way the cool wrought iron felt against his fingers . They went to her bedroom , and Sylvia shut the door . " Son , " she said , " Mrs. Jorgenson said you threatened her on the beach . Is it true ? " " I told her not to hurt Molly . " " Where is Molly ? " " I do n't know . " " Mrs. Jorgenson says she 's missing . Son , this is very serious . Mrs. Jorgenson has called the police . " The police station in Palm River was a small stucco building , pale yellow in color , with different lavatories for the white and the colored people , but one jail cell for both . It smelled of a drunk who had been sick there the night before , disinfectant , whisky and stale cigar smoke . In a back room there was a desk , an unmade cot and a calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small spaniel against her abnormally inflated breasts . " Lucky Dog , " the caption said . " Now look , " said the chief of police , a mild-appearing little man dressed like a hardware clerk . " This is a serious situation . A girl is missing . She has been absent from her home for more than five hours . And a boy threatened a grown woman on the beach at night . We have to put two and two together . " " You want to watch it , chief , " a lean lawyer with a brown vest said in a low voice at his ear . " You 're dealing with minors , and prominent families at that . "  | " I ai n't said nothing except the facts , " the chief said . John stood erect with his back against the wall . Beside him Sylvia sat on the cot , her head in her hands . Helen stood in the center of the room . " There was murder in his eyes , " she said . Margaret and Bruce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they had been there . " Now let 's play this thing over again , " the chief said in very reasonable tones . " Mrs. Jorgenson , did you do anything to upset the girl recently ? " " Not a thing , " she said . " I just had the doctor give her a physical examination to see if anything happened out on that island . I had to make sure . You can see that " " And the doctor 's report ? " " She was all right , " Helen said . Margaret and Bruce nodded again . " But she seemed upset ? " " Yes , she seemed very upset . She 's always been a difficult child . " " And you confined her to her room ? " " Yes . " " But she was n't there when you went to bring her her lunch . " " No . " " You thought she was hiding in the house to be spiteful , but could n't find her , and finally went looking on the beach . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat Buffalo accent . " And you met the boy and he threatened to kill you .. " " He did , " Helen said . " And you do n't deny this , do you ? " the chief asked , spinning to face John as he had seen detectives in television dramas do . " No . " John 's voice was low . He knew better than to try to explain things to adults . " When did you last see the girl ? " " Yesterday , " John said . " Last night , when we got back from the boat . " " I think you 're lying , " the chief said . " I think you met her on the beach , and I think you ... " " Take it easy , Bob , " the lawyer whispered . The chief sat back in his chair and lit a cigar .. " Nothing to do but wait , I guess , " he said . " We 'll search the beach and dunes . We 'll drag the river . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act so fast , but I do n't like the look of this case . "  | " Let the boy go home , " the lawyer said . " Suggest that he stay in his room . " " Will you keep the boy in his room ? " the chief asked Sylvia . " My son is innocent ! " Sylvia replied . She did n't lift her head . " Will you be responsible for him ? " " Of course ! " That night John stood at the window of his room staring out at the beach and the dunes , where lanterns were circling , tracing out the search . His mother tried to comfort him , but he said he did n't want to talk to her ; he was all right , he maintained stiffly as he had since he arrived in Florida , and needed no help . The surf pounded and the palm trees rustled in the wind . The clouds made a kind of island reaching up for the moon , and three stars could be seen from the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed from gray to white , and it really was n't a bad sort of night . The next day Molly was found wandering in a daze along the highway three miles north of town . For a week she was in the hospital recovering from exhaustion , and then she was confined to her bed . When Ken got home and learned what had happened , he struck Helen for the first time in his life . Helen screamed , and Margaret and Bruce came running . In the heat of anger Margaret said they knew about Sylvia , and Helen shrieked that she wanted a divorce . She could have it any time , Ken said , but he wanted Molly . A fine father he 'd make , Margaret replied . Aside from the question of his morality , had n't his judgment about the boat trip been proved wrong ? They 'd all been against it from the beginning , but Ken had got his way , and now look what had happened . " We have you cold , " Margaret said , lying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is effective . " We have witnesses . " The argument lasted all night , and most of the next day , and the Carters had many hurried telephone conversations with lawyers . The upshot of it all was a suit for divorce . It was agreed that during the proceedings it would be best to send Molly to boarding school . Ken spent a lot of time talking to his daughter , but she was withdrawn and would n't speak to him at A. After Helen got through telling her about Sylvia , she would n't even look at him . Briarwood Manor in Virginia , a school which Miss Summerfield , its headmistress , said was the best in the United States , was selected . The Carters escorted Molly to the train and seemed enraged to find  | Ken there with a large , elaborately wrapped box under his arm . John also came to see Molly off . It was a strained group which assembled around her . Ken gave her the box and told her to open it after the train started . " Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged . John had nothing to give her  --  only a look of naked , despairing love that made the Carters say it was lucky she was leaving . Molly shook hands with him and said she hoped she 'd see him again , but there was an almost deathlike passivity in her voice . She did n't look as though she cared much about seeing anybody again . Before the porter called " All aboard " she turned from her family and insisted on going alone to the compartment Ken had reserved for her . She sat there with the large box on her lap , staring out the window . It was an hour before she unwrapped her gift and found it to be a glossy mink coat , real mink . Bending double , she buried her face in the soft fur , and it was only then that she cried . 16 THERE WAS So MUCH TALK about the divorce that Sylvia decided it would be better to send John off to boarding school too as soon as possible , but it took several days to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon . Meanwhile , she told him , he did n't have to go to the local school  --  he could have it real vacation . Most of it he spent wandering around the Municipal Docks . " Now I want to tell you , sonny , " Captain Shay said . " You sit here long enough , and you can see almost anything come down the Inland Waterway . " John , who looked as lonely as he was , sat with his feet swinging off the edge of the wharf . Captain Shay sat at the wheel of the big auxiliary yawl he was paid to command for an owner too busy to use  | the boat . The captain had plenty of time on his hands , and loved to tell stories . " The things I 've seen ! " he said . " Just this last trip , in Norfolk , a homemade cruiser , just a motorboat , really , came alongside with two retired firemen aboard her . Bound for Florida and never sailed before . They asked if they could follow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Well , these firemen  --  I never did learn their names  --  had grown about a hundred bushels of potatoes in their back yards before they left home , and had stored them all aboard , and they had filled fivegallon oil cans with corn whisky they made themselves . " That 's all they had : potatoes and whisky , and the fish they could catch . Their pension money went for gas and oil . Well , you never saw a happier pair  --  in their seventies at least . They followed me along down the canals , drinking that corn whisky and throwing those five-gallon tins overboard . By the end of the day they were n't steering a very straight course , but all they had to do was stay in my wake . One of them had a banjo , and they 'd sing and drink and eat those potatoes . Helll You never saw a happier pair ! They got to Miami without ever running aground , and I do n't think they were sober a mile of the journey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Lots of nice people , " Captain Shay said . " A good many of the amateurs follow me down every fall , because they know I 'm a pro at the game . Sometimes I feel I 'm driving the engine of a long train . If I ever ran aground , a good many people would be stuck . " He lit his pipe . " I 'd be proud to be followed , " John said . " Hell ! It 's my profession and their play . I 'll tell you a funny one , though . A fellow came aboard in Atlantic City once and asked to follow me down , and I could n't figure it . He had a motor cruiser almost fifty feet long , looked like one of the old rumrunners . Fast . And he was a guy , you could tell , who knew the water . A little man sixty years old , who looked to have been to sea all his life . Why did he want to follow me at eight knots , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John asked . Captain Shay spat over the gleaming mahogany rail of the yacht . " I did n't find out for a few days , " he said . " The guy followed me along , and anchored a few hundred yards from me every night .  | Then one night we were anchored in the Dismal Swamp with a full moon overhead and I heard it . " " Heard what ? " John asked . " Ever heard a madwoman laugh ? " " Nol " " It ai n't pretty . It went on half the night , and I had a good mind to up anchor and get out of there , but I did n't . The next morning he rowed over and told me . " " Told you what ? " " His wife . She was nuts , and he did n't want to put her away . Wherever they lived ashore , the neighbors started to object . So this guy was a commander in the Navy , and he retired and bought a boat and kept her there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the company of another vessel . Sailed in convoy , so to speak . That 's what he told me once . " " Did you ever see her ? " John asked . " Sure . Little old woman sat on the fantail knitting most of the time , looked like anybody . Only sometimes , usually at night , she started to laugh . You 've never heard a sound like that . " " I guess not , " John said . " You sit here long enough and you can see almost anything come down the Inland Waterway , " Captain Shay concluded . 17 IT was obvious that the divorces would take many months to negotiate because there was agreement on so few issues . Barton came out of the Naval Hospital shaken , but he was still determined to maintain legal custody of his son . Sylvia told Ken she would n't be able to sleep on any night she knew John was on the island alone with Bart and Hasper . " Hell , " Ken said , " I think the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholic , if it comes to that , and your position will be much better when we can get married . "  | But of course they could n't get married until the divorce took place , and Sylvia had to be judged as a woman who had left her husband to become another man 's mistress . And Bart was careful to get a long technical report on his condition from the Navy doctors . On paper , he had an excellent record , marred only by one episode of acute alcoholism which had as a contributing factor the strains a man undergoes when he is abandoned by his wife . He was on the wagon now and as long as he did n't drink he had a pretty good case , the lawyers said . His position was , of course , much improved by the fact that the boy apparently did not want to stay with his mother , and displayed a fierce loyalty toward his father . Ken was in a hopelessly weak position when negotiating with Helen . She had all the top cards in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way to dispute her custody of Molly , but she was going a little far , her lawyer admitted , in trying to deny Ken the privilege of having his daughter visit him for at least a few weeks a year . It was lucky , everyone acknowledged , that Molly was at boarding school . The newspapers got hold of the story , and there was nothing pretty about it . Bart was described as a " Socialite War Hero " ; Ken appeared in the tabloids as the " Marfab Man , " and the editors ran old photographs of Sylvia which had reposed in their files since her days as a " community leader . " One difficulty was that Helen could not be convinced that it was wrong for her to talk to newspaper reporters . She loved sympathy , and publicity brought her that in quantity . She had nothing to hide , she said , and if the papers wanted the truth , why let them have it , and Margaret agreed . It gave them both a sense of importance to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were nice young men , really , and were never impolite . The world might as well know what a beast Ken Jorgenson was , Margaret said bitterly to one nice young man and a New York tabloid carried a lighthearted wrap-up story on the whole thing , with several pictures of Sylvia , a take-out on the Marvelous Sale of Marfab , and even a resume of Ken 's football record . When Sylvia took John to her room to explain that she was going to marry Ken as soon as the divorce became final , John said he hoped she 'd be very happy . " This is a hard thing for a boy , " Sylvia said . " Someday you 'll understand . " " I understand now , " John said without raising his voice ; and although  | his muscles were tense , he did not pull away when she kissed him . He just stood there . The day before they took John to the airport in Palm River , where he was to start his journey to Colchester Academy , Sylvia arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divorce was being negotiated , 6 It was , the lawyer had said , desirable for Sylvia and Ken to stay apart , so she did not go , but she told Ken it might be easier on the boy if the two of them got to know each other better . Ken agreed , and chartered a fishing cruiser to take them offshore , where the blue- j fish were running . John said he did n't want to go , but Sylvia begged him . " Look , " she told him , " Ken Jorgenson is a good man , and someday you 've got to learn that . We have to face realities in life , and there 's no point in building up a lot of horrors in your mind . He 's a good man who loves both of us , and you 're going to hurt his feelings , terribly if you refuse to go . " " I 'll go if you want , " John replied quietly . " It 's just that I do n't really like fishing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children of the divorced ; he was developing a poise she could not break through , a courtesy of the sort his father could show strangers when he wished . John always stood when she entered the room now , coming to attention , almost , the way Bart did ; and with that same touch of elegance which his father had even when he was quite drunk , John now was lighting her cigarettes for her and opening doors for her , until she wanted to cry . The day of fishing was not a success . John said , " Thank you , sir , " when Ken handed him a rod , and " No thank you , sir , " when Ken offered to show him how to bait a hook for bluefish . With a touch of arrogance he added , " Sir , I 've been fishing all my life . " With sad eyes Ken watched John move around the boat , admiring the easy grace , the flair for doing small things well which he had always admired in Bart as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis . He liked the easy way the boy handled the fishing equipment , never getting anything snarled , and the quiet assurance with which he braced himself against the roll as the cruiser lunged through the inlet and the going got rough . After they had fished with a good deal of success for a few hours , the captain of the boat asked John to take the helm while he went below to get lunch . The boy stood balanced on his toes , turning the wheel hardly at all , knowing instinctively , apparently , how to meet the boat 's yawing before it started .  | " You 're quite a sailor , are n't you ? " Ken said admiringly . " Thank you , sir , " John replied . " My father taught me , sir . He was the captain of a ship in the war . Did you know that , sir ? " " Yes , " Ken said gravely . " He was a fine Naval officer . That is something of which you ought to be proud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's voice was polite . " No , I was n't , " Ken replied , and felt obliged to add , " They seemed to think us research men should stay home . " " Yes , sir , " John said . At the end of the day Ken put his big hand on the boy 's shoulder and said , " Johnny , could we talk for a few minutes ? " " Certainly , sir . " They sat alone on the flying bridge , while the boat plowed placidly up the Inland Waterway returning home . Ken 's voice was deep and soft . " I just want you to know that we 'll all come through this time of trouble , " he said . " Your father and your mother and I are all decent people , and we 'll solve our difficulties . We all want to help you in any way we can . " " Thank you , sir : " " Someday next year maybe we can all get together on Pine Island , or down here . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can spend some of your vacations with us . " " Maybe , sir . " Ken wanted to grab the boy and say , Do n't be like that ; do n't think that you have to stand alone ; come here and put your head down and cry if you want to , or hit me , or shout , but get it out , damn it ; say it and let 's have it over with ; you 've got to get it out before you can learn it 's not as bad as you think . But that had n't worked with Molly , and he knew it would n't work with John . That night Sylvia disregarded for the first time the advice of her lawyers , who told her she should n't even telephone Ken until the divorce was fuial . From the hotel to which she had moved she called him to ask how the day had gone . " I could n't reach him , " Ken said sadly . " It will take time . " Sylvia sighed . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , " I love you , Ken . I love you for trying . " " I love you . Do n't worry about the kids . They 're going to be all right . " " I hope sol " " We just need time , " Ken said . Part Three DO YOU EVER GET LONELY ?  | 18 COLCHESTER ACADEMY , which stood in an isolated section of the countryside about fifty miles from Hartford , Connecticut , was , as such things are counted , a good school . It catered not only to the children of the divorced , the widowed and the sick , but to those with intellectual or social ambitions unattainable at home . It was an old school , started in 1803 , and many famous men had gone there . Barton Hunter himself was an alumnus of Colchester Academy , and it was his influence which enabled John to enter midterm , in March of 1954 ? The morning John arrived , Mr. Nealy , one of the teachers , met him at the station . Mr. Nealy was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a professor of the classics at Harvard , but he had failed to get his doctor 's degree , and for twenty-one years had been an instructor at Colchester Academy . He had foolishly bought a secondhand car in which to escape to Hartford for weekends , and the payments on it were more than his slender budget could maintain . His wife had told him that morning that the ache in her shoulder was persisting and that she might have to go to the hospital . Mr. Nealy was preoccupied when he met John , and there was n't much warmth in his handshake . The two of them rode silently to the office of Mr. Caulfield , the headmaster , who explained to John that he would have to work hard to make good at Colchester Academy . " I 'll try , sir , " John said .  | Mr. Nealy then took John to his dormitory and introduced him to his roommate , a thin boy named Bill Norris , who was also fifteen years old , and who had a slight stutter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bill said , smiling pleasantly . " I did n't like rooming alone . " " Could you tell me where the post office is ? " John asked after shaking hands . Before unpacking his bag , John crossed the muddy quadrangle of the school without even glancing at the handsome brick buildings which distinguished alumni had given to Colchester Academy because it had done so much for them . Following Bill 's directions , he entered a small room beside the dining hall which was used as a post office . There was a strange smell , a compound of paste , ink and cheap perfume used by the janitor 's wife , who served as postmistress . No one was in sight . John knocked softly on a sliding panel beneath a sign reading sTAmps , and a female voice said , " Yes ? " " My name is John Hunter . Is there any mail for me ? " " No , " the voice said without any hesitation . " You new ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " Wait a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a pause before a withered hand with a large artificial diamond ring placed a small slip of paper at the window . " Box 135 , " the voice said . " There 's your combination . " John read the figures : 18-25-02 . Going to his box , he twirled the dials and opened it once or twice , just for practice . Going back to his room , he sat down at his desk and wrote a letter . " Dear Molly , " he said . " I 'm at a place called Colchester Academy . My roommate 's name is Bill Norris , and he seems like a nice guy . I flew here from Palm River , and some of the people on the plane were sick , but I was n't . I like flying , do n't you ? " It was hard to know what to put in letters . John nibbled the end of his pen , and after staring around his room , decided to describe that for her . " The walls are green , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice view . " He put an airmail stamp on this communication and walked across the quadrangle to put it in the postoffice slot . Molly 's answer came four days later . " Dear Johnny , " she wrote . " Your school sounds like mine ; my walls are exactly the same color . I think that 's marvelous , do n't you ? I hope the food you get is better than ours , though . Frankly , I could n't exist here if we were n't allowed to go to the drugstore to eat . "  | This was the beginning of a steady interchange of letters . Neither John nor Molly ever mentioned their parents . They talked about food and movies they had seen and books they were reading . The meaning of the letters lay in their existence , not in what they said . Quite often during that first period at school , John heard from his mother . Sylvia wrote short , cheerful letters about the fishing in Florida , and about the shells she was beginning to collect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to get married next summer , " she said in one letter , mentioning it casually , along with plans for a trip abroad . John did n't answer that letter . Every month he sent his mother a dutiful postcard , but that was all . Bart wrote irregularly , often enclosing small checks . His letters were rarely more than three or four sentences long . " Dear Son , " he said once , " Hope you 're well ; we 're all well here . " Bart always used the word " we " when he wrote from Pine Island , even when he was living in the big house alone . His letters were always signed , " Hastily yours , " as though he lived an incredibly busy life . As the weeks wore on , Ken , Sylvia and Bart seemed to fade from John 's life ; he did n't think about them much any more . Molly was more real , especially when she sent him a copy of a school photograph she had had taken . It showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair with her hands folded on her lap . " Do n't I look like a gump ? " Molly wrote in her letter , and John replied , " I like your picture very much . " He wanted to add that he thought she looked beautiful , but of course he could n't say that ; he blushed at the very thought of writing such a thing in a letter . A few days later he sent her a picture of himself , feeling embarrassed because he thought it seemed so much better than he really was , yet grateful to the photographer for making it look as though he were n't beginning to get spots on his face . At night when the lights were out , John and Bill Norris talked for hours . Bill 's father had recently died from shrapnel wounds suffered in the war ; he had been bedridden for many years . Bill had a theory , almost a conviction , that another war was coming soon , and that he too would be killed by it . " They 'll be using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said casually . " We 're just the right age . " " I guess so , " John said without alarm , simply trying to be agreeable . It was a matter on which he had no opinion . Bill Norris had a harder time at school than John did , and sometimes he cried at night . There was something about him which made  | the larger boys pick on him . They were forever jostling him in hallways , flicking him with towels in the shower baths , and making him the butt of jokes . He detested athletics , which amounted to heresy at Colchester Academy , for the great rivalry with Hampshire Academy thirty miles away demanded the earnest efforts of all the boys , even the little ones who could only carry buckets of water . Because he spent most of his unsupervised study hours lying on his bed staring at the ceiling , Bill also had trouble with his studies . Goaded to exasperation , Mr. Nealy sometimes picked up the edge of the big table around which the class sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to study , Bill ! " he said . " What do you think you 're here for ? " " I don'ta , don'ta , do n't know , Mr. Nealy , " Bill replied . In his bottom bureau drawer under his sweaters , Bill kept , among other things , an album of pictures his father had taken during the Second World War , which he had found in the attic of his mother 's house in New Rochelle , and bad stolen . It contained cracked and yellowed snapshots of groups of young men in soiled uniforms , big guns in the mud with their barrels tilted skyward , crashed airplanes , and one terrifying picture of a tangled pile of the dead , showing one corpse in the foreground with his mouth open and a hand outstretched . " My father saw that , " Bill said proudly . " He was there . " " My father was the captain of a ship , " John replied with equal pride . Bill also had hidden under his clothes in the bottom bureau drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his most treasured possession . " No firearms shall be kept in the rooms , " the school 's rules said , but the pistol had been given to Bill by his own father shortly before he died ; it was his inheritance , and he smuggled it in . For hours he sat polishing it , and at night quite often John saw him steal from his covers , get the pistol , and take it to bed with him , as younger boys might take a Teddy bear . " You can see , " Bill said many time &,; pointing to a headline in the paper . " They 're getting close to it . " Bill Norris had a second album of pictures hidden away which John stumbled on by mistake while attempting to borrow a pair of socks , a collection of photographs of nude women . They were not pornographic photographs , such as a boy from Florida named Dick Woller surreptitiously invited friends into his room to see ; Bill 's were routine art shots , some of them quite beautiful . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young woman leaning against a Grecian pillar on the steps of a ruined building , with dark braids falling down on each side of her full , perfectly formed breasts . Bill came into the room while John was poring over this collection and furiously grabbed it from him , both boys blushing piteously . " You should n't have taken that ! " Bill said , almost in tears . Bill Norris ' Latin went from bad to worse during the few months John knew him , and John himself had so much trouble making up for his lack of instruction in Latin and algebra on Pine Island that at Mr. Caulfield 's suggestion , he dropped back a year . Mr. Nealy 's temper kept getting shorter . He threw pieces of chalk and blackboard erasers at Bill and John , and in supposedly mock fury picked up a chair once and threatened to let them have it . John had a capacity for hard , driving work , and before long he had his studies under control , but Bill Norris kept lagging farther and farther behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because he lived with him , John shared his agonies , and of all he learned at Colchester Academy , the story of the short , sad education of Bill Norris stuck in his mind longest . Colchester Academy Builds Men , as its brochure proclaimed . Mr. Caulfield , the headmaster , and Mr. Nealy had themselves been built there , but they were n't sure that Bill Norris was " good material . " The curriculum they prescribed for him included a dead and a foreign language , mathematics and English . The boys ' personal lives were not considered to be the school 's business , and some kinds of ignorance were thought to be beyond its province . Many of the students , including Bill Norris , believed that masturbation would drive them insane , that their backbones would turn to liquid , and that hair would grow on the palms of their hands . Horror beyond the imagination of an adult dwelt in their minds . Bill Norris was caught in a toilet booth . Dick Woller spied on him through a crack in the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chairs and stood on them , looking over the wall of the booth , and in unison called , " Hey Bill ! What are you doing ? " He bolted , panic-stricken , holding up his pants , and ran to his room , bursting in upon John , who was trying to translate Caesar . " What 's the matter ? " John said . Bill 's eyes were crazed . From the hall the boys followed him . " Go ahead , Bill , " they said . " Do n't mind us ! " " Well , now , we 'll hear a recitation from Bill Norris , " Mr. Nealy  | said the next day in Latin class . " You , I suppose , Bill , have again got your lesson letter-perfect today ? " Laughter . As in the Congressional Record , laughter had to be noted often in any true report of the doings at Colchester Academy . Bill looked up , his face pale , and said , " I'm-a , I'm-a , I 'm afraid I have n't done my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Nealy retorted with relish . " You mean my star student has come to class unprepared ? " " I'm-a , I 'm afraid so , Mr. Nealy , " Bill said . " Try to translate the first line anyway . Page ninety-two , in case you do n't know . " Laughter . Mr. Nealy was a great comedian . " Caesar , " Bill stammered , " Caesar was merciful to the Gauls . " " Very good , " Mr. Nealy said . " After two years of my expert tutelage you can now translate six simple words of Latin almost right . I guess this is as much of a triumph as we can expect today . Time 's up  --  class dismissed ! " A few weeks later the boys played another prank on Bill Norris . They cut letters from a newspaper to make a headline reading " Bill Norris Found Dead in Bed " ? this , in the atmosphere of Colchester Academy , being an obviously obscene reference . Bill saw it on the bulletin board and blushed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boys waiting to see his reaction . It was John Hunter who took the sign down . " You leave that upl " Dick Weller said . He was a broad-faced , redhaired , freckled boy a year older than John and bigger . John walked toward him slowly , holding the pasted-up newspaper clipping in his hand . " Did you make this ? " he asked quietly . " Who wants to know ? " Quickly , without premeditation , John hit him , a full man 's blow in the mouth . The boy staggered back with blood welling from his lips , and John was all over him , pounding his fists into his face and belly . It took three boys and a mastdr to haul him off . " I hear you started it , " Mr. Caulfield said to John that night . " Yes , sir . " " Why . " John said nothing because the subject was unspeakable . A wall lay between the generations through which one could not talk or see or hear . " Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Twelve demerits for fighting , " Mr. Caulfield said . " Remember , if you get twenty demerits , you 'll be expelled . " " Yes , sir , " John said . John went to the music building and sat for three hours playing the piano that afternoon . There were a few good teachers . One of them , Albert Newfield , tried to tutor Bill Norris every night to help him catch up in his Latin , but Bill did not prove very co-operative . " To tell the truth , Mr. Newfield , I do n't see much point to Latin , " he said . " It 's mental exercise . Learning it will help you to do any kind of intellectual work well . " " Will it ? " " Of course . " " I do n't think I 'm really much of an intellectual , " Bill said . " I mean , I do n't really have many ambitions that way . " With Mr. Newfield , Rill did n't stutter so much . " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " Bill replied . " I guess I just do n't have any . I think there 's going to be a war , and I guess that will take care of that . " " But you need an education to fight in a war , even if one does come . " " Do you ? " " Of course . You want to be an officer , do n't you ? " " No , " Bill Norris said . In late April there was a dance at Colchester Academy , and John asked Molly , but her school would not allow her to come without her parents ' permission and her mother said no . Only about a third of the boys got girls for the dance . On the great night a line of Japanese lanterns was hung from the administration building to the gymnasium , where the orchestra was playing love songs at one end of the basketball court . The lucky boys in white dinner coats walked with the girls to the gymnasium after supper . It was twilight , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening gowns , and John , leaning out of his dormitory window to watch , found it almost impossible to believe that they could be so beautiful , and still walk with the boys from Colchester Academy . Even Dick Woller had a girl , a stout young lady before whom he was painfully shy , but whom he later claimed to have seduced . Dick Woller always carried a condom in his wallet and boastfully showed it to his friends .  | " Foolish not to carry one , " he said in his slow Florida drawl . " After all , they do n't weigh much . " Dick Woller caused John always to hate a Southern accent . During those lonely months John 's face and body , plagued by the difficulties of adolescence , grew more splotchy , and he felt himself to be unclean . Looking at himself in the mirror , he was certain he was growing up to be ugly , hideous beyond redemption , and it did not seem in the least surprising to him in retrospect that his mother had chosen his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love a face like his ? It was nice that he and Molly just exchanged letters , he thought . As the brochure also said , Colchester Academy fits its program to the individual child . Early one Sunday morning a group of the individual children led by Dick Woller stole into the room where Bill Norris was sleeping and ripped the covers from his bed . " Just want to make sure you 're behaving yourself , boyl " Dick Woller said . But the joke did n't work out quite the way Dick Woller expected . Bill Norris in his rumpled pajamas awoke with a start , sat up , his eyes wild , and in his hand was a gun . The evil black pistol emerging suddenly from beneath the white pillow was such an astonishing sight that the boys stood gaping , crowding back against the wall . There was a click as Bill cocked the gun . His hand did not tremble . " You bastards leave me alone , " he said , " or I 'll kill you , every one . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it , soon got to Mr. Caulfield , the headmaster , who was shocked to learn that a Colchester Academy boy would do such a terrible thing , that he should have a gun he had n't registered with Mr. Nealy , who was in charge of the rifle range . Bad stuff . Not in the tradition of Colchester Academy . Not at all . Mr. Caulfield called all the boys who had seen the incident to the administration building . They stood in a semicircle around his desk . " Was the gun loaded ? " Mr. Caulfield asked . " No , " Bill Norris replied . " I did n't put the bullet in it . " " But you have a bullet ? " " Yes . One . " " Where did you get it ? " " I found it in my father 's collar box . " " This is very serious , " Mr. Caulfield said . " He never loads the gun , sir , " John Hunter said , trying to be helpful .  | " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caulfield said . " To think that a Colchester Academy boy kept a gun in his room is bad enough . To think that he threatened other boys with it is intolerable . I will of course have to confiscate the gun . " " No , " Bill Norris replied . " Bring it to me immediately , " Mr. Caulfield thundered . John and the other boys who had been called as witnesses glanced apprehensively at each other . " You will have to leave this school immediately if you do not conform to the rules , " Mr. Caulfield said to Bill Norris . " All right , " Bill replied in a low voice . " That 's better , " Mr. Caulfield replied , sounding relieved . " Just tell us where you 've hidden it , and I 'll ask one of the masters to pick it up . " " I 'll get it myself , " Bill said and walked out of the room , looking as lie always did , a little pale , but not visibly upset . Mr. Caulfield picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . There was a pause . " He just left here to get it for me , " Mr. Caulfield said . 1 think you better stay with him . " Putting the receiver down , Mr. Caulfield turned in his swivel chair and faced the witnesses . " How did this incident start ? " he asked . " We were just teasing him a little , " Dick Woller said . " How were you teasing him ? " " Just fooling around , " Dick Woller replied . " We pulled the covers off his bed . " " You should n't have done that , " Mr. Caulfield said , " but of course it 's no excuse for him to .. . " But you do n't understand , " John said . " Do n't understand ? " One of Mr. Caulfield 's eyebrows went up . He was quite proud of being able to make one go up that way , while the other stayed still . " No , you do n't understand , " John repeated . At that moment there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and saw Mr. Nealy running in the quadrangle , his mouth agape . He arrived , gasping for breath , in Mr. Caulfield 's office and said , " He 's gone ! He 's gone ! " Mr. Nealy was n't very coherent , but finally he was able to explain what had happened . His car had been parked in front of his apartment in the dormitory ; he had left it there because his wife had lilanned to drive to the hospital to continue special treatments for leer shoulder . Bill Norris had stolen it . Coming out of the dormitory  | beside Mr. Nealy with the gun in his hand , Bill had threatened to shoot himself if anyone tried to stop him . He had got into the car , had started it , still holding the gun in one hand , and a half dozen boys , besides Mr. Nealy , had been afraid to stop him because of the look on his face , Mr. Nealy said ; a terrible look . Suddenly Bill had raced the engine , and with a screech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school 's driveway , disappearing in the direction of the state highway . " Sit down , Mr. Healy , " Mr. Caulfield said . " You boys run along and leave us alone now . " But Mr. Nealy could n't wait . " He was going to shoot himself , " he said , and put his face on his knees and wept . " You boys run along and come back here in half an hour , " Mr. Caulfield said , and picked up the telephone . John and the others walked outside . All the masters in the school appeared almost by magic , like the crew of a ship in time of disaster . The superintendent of grounds immediately began to erase the tire marks on the lawn . An elderly football coach walked around the quadrangle saying , " Let 's get up a game , boysl We 'll set up two teams chosen by lot , and I 'll put up a trip to New York for the winnersl " " Tonight we should have a special movie , " a mousy English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where are you going ? " a French instructor asked John . " I thought I 'd take a walk . " " Why do n't you come up to the room with me and have a glass of sherry ? I think you 're old enough . " It was an order , not an invitation . John followed him dutifully , and sat on a couch sipping the cheap sweet wine . Mr. Caulfield did n't like to call the police when the boys ran away from school . It was n't good to give the youngsters even a juvenile record , and it was bad publicity for the school . Usually a quiet telephone call to the home did the trick , or the homes if the son of a broken marriage was the offender , as was so often the case . Some judicious waiting usually produced the boy within twenty-four hours , but this case seemed to Mr. Caulfield to be different . The image of a fifteen-year-old boy careening along the highway with a gun on the seat beside him was appalling . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was given a sedative , Mr. Caulfield called the state police . A trooper caught sight of Bill Norris in Mr. Nealy 's car about  | twenty miles outside of Hartford . He was driving toward New York ii at a normal speed , but when the trooper tried to wave him down , he stepped on the gas . The chase lasted almost an hour , because the trooper was a fifty-year-old man with four children and he did n't want to risk his life unnecessarily chasing some crazy hopped-up kid with a gun . Some of these juvenile delinquents are worse than the hardened criminals , the trooper reflected darkly as he held his speedometer at eighty , and tried to get headquarters on the radio to have a road block set up ahead . I do n't know what the world is coming to , he thought ; for Christ 's sake , a fifteen-year-old kid with a gun , and from a rich family too , coming from a school like that . If he points his goddamn gun at me , I 'll shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his holster . " Yes , " he said , when he finally got contact on his radio . " I 've got him  --  just keeping him in sight . Get the boys in Draytown on the job , will you ? The way he 's going , he 'll roar through there in about ten minutes , so for Christ 's sake get the people off the street . " Bill saw the road block way ahead ; they had put it on a straight stretch of road so he would have plenty of room in which to stop . Two state police cars were parked there with their red lights blinking and their sirens going full blast , and beside the road three men stood with drawn guns . I might kill somebody if I sailed into those police cars , Bill thought , and picked a telegraph pole instead . The car snapped it and ripped a swath two hundred yards long through the earth before it stopped , and by that time it was so crumpled and enveloped in flame that it was hard to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The policemen came running and stood in a semicircle around it calling for fire extinguishers . It was n't necessary for Bill to wait for a hydrogen bomb : the flames in the automobile were quite hot enough . A special meeting was called in the study hall with all boys who knew Bill present . " A very sad thing has happened today , " Mr. Caulfield said . " Bill Norris was killed in an accident . " He paused . " Now it would be very unfair to repeat much about this , " he continued . " Unfair to Bill Norris , and to his mother . " None of the boys said anything . " Poor Bill was probably having trouble at home , and felt he had to get there quickly , " Mr. Caulfield said .  | Still no one said anything . " It is a tragic accident , " Mr. Caulfield said . " A fine boy is dead , and we must all respect his memory . " " Yes suh , " Dick Woller said . His lip trembled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting , " Mr. Caulfield said more briskly . " Classes will of course be held as usual , but anyone who wishes may join the football game out at the gym , and there will be a special movie tonight . " He hesitated , and for a moment he looked confused . " Boys , " he said , " things like this happen sometimes in life , and no one can be blamed . We have to trust in God , I guess . Run along now , and try not to dwell on it too much . " He sank wearily into his chair . The boys filed silently out and joined the others in the quadrangle . " Where did it happen ? " a thin boy asked . " Outside Draytown , " someone said . A crowd of boys gathered around . " Mr. Nealy sure took it hard , " a fat one said . " He 's gone to the hospital . An ambulance came in the back way and got him . " " I thought he was dead , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm talking about Mr. Healy . " " Ted Whitely heard on the radio that the car was completely demolished , " a solemn child about thirteen years old with the puffedout cheeks and mild blue eyes of a cherub said . " It burned him up . " John turned away , nauseated . He walked across the muddy quadrangle into the woods , and leaning against the cold bark of an oak , vomited . Then he started to walk slowly through the woods , aimlessly , his tracks circling widely and crossing , twisting back again , forming a pattern of agony and confusion in the mud . Exhausted , he finally returned to the school . A police car was parked by Mr. Caulfield 's office , and a master was shooing the boys away from that part of the quadrangle . John headed for the dining hall and sat there without eating . Later that afternoon he went to ? his room . Bill 's bed , with a new counterpane , was neatly made up , and looked shockingly empty . The silence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer where Bill kept his collections of photographs , and found it too was empty . John wondered what Mr. Caulfield would think of the collection of faded snapshots of the war , and of the nudes , of the girl with the dark braids leaning against the pillar of the ruin , of her wondrously rich , symmetrical body . Mr. Caulfield would have these things  | burned , probably . Everything , even Bill 's clothes were gone , and the room was lonely as a tomb . Three days afterward Mr. Caulfield told John that Bill Norris ' mother would like to talk to him . " You realize , of course , that were In a rather difficult situation , " Mr. Caulfield said . " Bill 's death was an occident , as you know , but the boy was disturbed  --  there 's no doubt about that . Yet we ca n't say that . Mrs. Norris is herself a highly strung person , and we ca n't do anything that would hurt her " " I 'll try not to , " John said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caulfield 's home , a handsome brick house at the north end of the campus , where a formal tea was held for the students once a month to give the students a little home atmosphere . She was a thin woman who looked shockingly like her son done up for a costume ball , with long hair and a black dress . She leaned forward on the reproduction of a Hitchcock chair , with her hands clasped tightly in her lap . " So you 're Bill 's roommate , " she said . " He wrote so happily about you . " " I liked Bill very much , " John said . " I do n't want to make things difficult for you , " Mrs. Norris continued . " I know this is a hard thing for a young boy . It must be almost as hard on you as it is on me . " Mr. Caulfield , sitting in a gold upholstered easy chair , cleared his throat . John stood in the center of the floor . He was too nervous to sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some things I do hope you 'll tell me , which I 'm sure you 'll understand I have to know . " " Yes , " John said . " Do you know where Bill was going when he left here , and why he stole a car ? " John stared at his feet . " I think he did it on a dare , " Mr. Caulfield said . " He was always such a venturesome boy . Some of the others may have dared him to take the car , and of course he did n't really know how to drive ... " " That 's what I think , " John heard himself saying . " It must have been a dare . " Mrs. Norris sighed . " It 's strange , " she said . " He always seemed to me to be such a timid child . . . " " I think we ought to have a glass of sherry , " Mr. Caulfield said gravely . Colchester Academy used sherry the way the British Navy uses  | rum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat sipping it , trying to think of nice things to say about Bill to his mother . " He was liked by everyone , " he heard himself saying . " He was one of the most popular boys in school . " Fifteen minutes later Mr. Caulfield accompanied John to the door and squeezed his elbow approvingly while saying goodbye . John felt obscurely venal , but what truth could he have told Bill 's mother ? How could he have explained the things that had happened , and who , after all , knew why ? 19 THE NEGOTIATIONS for the divorce dragged on , and Sylvia and Ken did not realize their hopes of getting married quickly . Sylvia remained in Florida throughout that summer of 1954 , walking on the beach with Carla , seeking shells . Ken made many trips to New York , where Bernie Anderson had moved to start their new business . Helen would not let him see Molly , at least until everything was settled , because it upset the poor child too much , she said . Ken wrote Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a pair of white angora mittens which were certainly out of season , but which somehow reminded him of her ; a necklace of cultured pearls , and a light gray , rather adult hat with a cocky little feather which he saw in a store window and thought would look nice on her . In return he got short notes which in rather stilted phrases expressed gratitude for the gifts and nothing else . The year 1954 was hard for everyone concerned . John refused to go to summer camp and stayed with his father on Pine Island . Barton wrote Helen , inviting her and Molly to pay them a visit , but he got a polite refusal . Molly had n't been awfully well lately , Helen wrote , and they were going to keep her home . There were no young people his age on the island that year , and for the first week of his summer vacation John wandered by himself over every inch of the place , exploring the highest mountains , the  | deep ravines and the most deserted sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the inn playing the old piano , teaching himself new songs , but the piano was badly out of tune and it would cost a great deal to have a man come from the mainland to fix it . At the end of a week , John told his father it was stupid to waste time , and he wanted to work . " At what ? " Bart asked . The wharf was badly rotted , John pointed out , and the gardens needed a great deal of attention . " I could trim bushes if Todd would show me how , " he said . " The wharf is a much bigger job . " Hasper had had arthritis badly that winter , and his hands were gnarled as the limbs of old trees . Glowering silently , he gave John a lesson in pruning , and John got to work . His ambition was to put the whole garden in shape , which was impossible for even a grown man to do in one summer , but he worked feverishly , often arising at dawn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the muscles of his back and shoulders were beginning to develop like those of a professional athlete . Bait fell off the wagon frequently that year . He had trouble getting women from Harvesport to stay as housekeepers at the inn , but only a dozen old ladies requested reservations , and there was n't much which Lillian , the cook , could n't handle by herself . On warm summer evenings Bart often stood talking to John while the boy was working . They made an odd sight together . John , wearing only a pair of soiled khaki trousers , wielded the big pruning shears without comment during most of the conversations , while Bart , dressed in a white linen suit , followed him from bush to bush , glass in hand . What Bait talked about most of the time was the war , and the part he had played in it ; he had a compulsion to make his son understand this ; it seemed extremely important that he know , and Bart talked about it almost incessantly , repeating himself over and over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nagged by the feeling that John did n't fully understand . By the end of summer the story was so deeply ingrained in John 's mind that it was almost as much a part of the boy 's personal experience as his father 's . The story began when Bart joined the Naval Reserve at college in the belief that it might increase his skills as a yachtsman . " Naval Science , " as it was called at Harvard , was his only good subject , and when the war broke out , he was able to get an ensign 's commission  | in spite of the fact that he had never graduated . In January of 1942 , he was called to active duty and stationed aboard an old four-stack destroyer which was escorting ships to England . As soon as the ship left Boston Harbor , Bart was , to his great astonishment , hopelessly seasick . All his life he had sailed boats , but the destroyer racing at twenty knots through the winter seas was something entirely different . The convoy she was escorting had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic zigzag pattern . She was changing course constantly , first rolling forty-five degrees , then pitching her bow under green water up to the five-inch gun . The men aboard her were shaken like dried peas in a rattle . But although he was sick , Bart never missed a watch . Often he stood on the wing of the bridge with a bucket hooked over his left arm . He lost twenty pounds and got so weak he had to hang onto a stanchion with both arms , sometimes , just to keep upright , but he braved it out , and after a month the seasickness diminished . Within two months he was allowed to stand a deck watch by himself . The most junior officer was usually given the graveyard watch , as it was called , lasting from midnight to four in the morning . In March of 1942 , on only the third night that he had stood his own watch , a heavy gale was blowing . The convoy consisted of a dozen naval tankers taking gasoline to bases in Britain . Heavy-laden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the convoy speed had to be reduced to four knots . There were no moon and stars that night , and Bart 's ship had not yet been given radar . Depending on eyesight and echo sounding devices alone , Bart 's destroyer and three others tried to keep close to the unlighted vessels without running into them . It was bitter cold , with the spray freezing on deck and on the portholes of the pilothouse . On the port wing of the bridge Bart huddled against the wind , staring with binoculars into the rush of blackness . It was eighteen minutes after two in the morning when a star shell suddenly burst over the convoy , turning the raging sea white . A wolf pack of five black submarines , almost invisible in the night , came charging arrogantly in on the surface with their deck guns stabbing the fat-bellied tankers . It had n't been necessary for the submarines to send up another star shell , for in the few seconds that the first one hung blazing in the sky , a gas tanker exploded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Bart rang up general quarters , and before his commanding officer  | came on deck , changed course to race in the direction of one blurred shape , which he dimly saw through his binoculars . The submarines seemed to be all around them , lying low in the water just beyond the circle of fire made by the tanker , which burned fast . The convoy broke formation and scattered in many directions . The big tankers lumbered along like panicked cows in the night , while the lean destroyers knifed in and out of their ranks , but in the blackness it was almost impossible to tell friend from foe . The shadowy shape toward which Bart had altered course was still indistinct when the captain got to the bridge ; it was low in the water , almost awash , and while they stared at it through their binoculars , there was a flash of a gun on the forward deck . " Open fire , " Bart 's captain said , and it was fortunate that the destroyer had a green crew ; fortunate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate that most of the first barrage missed , for when one shell hit that indistinct shape it blossomed in fire and became not a submarine but a tanker . The gun crews aboard the destroyer realized this even before the order to cease fire came from the bridge ; it became apparent instantaneously to everyone on deck , and a deathly , sickened silence reigned aboard the ship . Astern of them another tanker , hit by a submarine , exploded , spilling yellow fire over the sea . Oh , there was oil on troubled waters that night , Bart said . The gasoline blazed for many miles around when eight of those tankers went down together , and there was oil on troubled waters indeed . Bart 's destroyer wheeled , and at full speed charged right through the blazing sea . It was possible to see now , oh it was possible to see quite clearly , Bait told his son . Exposed in the glare of the destruction they had created , the five submarines lay naked in the night , long , black and obscene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At point-blank range the three destroyers opened up with everything they had , the bull-throated five-inchers , the sharpcracking three-inchers , the chattering machine guns of many different calibers  --  all these exploded in crescendos of fury , and they sank three of those submarines before they had a chance to submerge . Afterward the destroyers prowled the burning seas , searching for the other two . One of the submerged submarines doubled back and lay under the burning oil spilling from a tanker , for that is where Bart 's destroyer followed its echo . The ping of the echoranging gear came through the machines on the bridge of the destroyer  | quite clearly , and the man with the headphones on Bart 's ship chanted in a deep Southern accent , " Bearing zero two one , range two thousand yards and closing rapidly ; bearing zero two five , range fifteen hundred yards ; bearing zero three zero , range one thousand yards ; bearing zero three five , range . . . " Bart stood on the wing of the bridge while all around the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the K-guns of the destroyer tossed the heavy depth charges out on both sides . More depth charges rolled over her stern , and suddenly the burning sea exploded . Geysers of fire shot into the night ; the ocean boiled as the deep-set charges went off , and in the midst of all this more oil from the wounded submarine floated to the surface and ignited . That is what happened , or that , at least , is what Bart told his son on the warm summer evenings in their garden , and John listened understandingly , it seemed , or at least half-understandingly , although most of the time the only sound from him while his father talked was the steady clip , clip , clip of the pruning shears . The other destroyers went looking for the surviving tankers , which had scattered over the horizon , and Bart 's ship returned to the one tanker that was left burning , the one she herself had hit . Smoke was still pouring from her pilothouse and bridge , while on her rolling deck her crew scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serpentine hoses rather than dragging them . The destroyer blinked her signal light at her , and from the bow of the tanker the tiny pinprick of a flashlight answered . The lights talked for ten minutes , after which it was clear that it seemed possible to bring the fire under control , although there was still great danger , because the ship was loaded with gasoline and might explode at any minute . All the officers were dead except the engineering officer , for the shell had hit the bridge . The crew was exhausted from fighting the fire . Bait was standing beside his commanding officer when the signalman gave this information . " Sir , " Bart said , " let me take a boat over . " " Too risky , " the captain replied ; that 's what he really said ; the captain thought it much too risky , Bart told his son . But Bart insisted , and a boat with fifteen volunteers was swung over the side of the destroyer . Bart , who had always been good at sailing small boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea is a precarious business , John learned from his father . The ship rolls the boat into the water at one moment , and before the blocks and tackle can be disengaged , lifts it fifty feet  | into the air the next . Oh , it is a fine art to lower a boat in a raging sea , and a finer art to pull away from the ship before being hurled against her topsides and smashed . But that night Bart did it perfectly ; his timing was exact , and suddenly the boat was free of its murderous mother ship . With the men straining at the oars , the boat sank into a great valley between two mountains of water , while the destroyer shot up to the peaks overhead , and then the boat shot up and the destroyer slid into the valley . But by that time they were a hundred yards apart , with the men grunting at the oars to make the distance grow , and the destroyer 's engines whining in reverse , as she tried to wrench herself away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the boat from capsizing . Ahead of them a small bloom of fire still glowed rose red in the middle of the heavy smoke pouring from the tanker 's bridge . Coming alongside the ship was just as precarious as leaving the destroyer ; it was the same operation in reverse , but again Bart judged it right , and the tanker 's men , almost collapsing in exhaustion , cheered . Bart began to help fight the fire aboard the tanker . Trying to forget the great pool of gasoline under the hot decks beneath his feet , he led a crew of men with hoses to the very base of the flames . The engineering officer , a huge man with a bulging paunch hanging out over his belt , led another group , and within an hour they got the fire out . After examining the damage , they decided they could limp into port unaided , steering from the stern with a jury rig . The destroyer left them ; far to the north the remnants of the convoy needed her help . An escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the winter of 1942 . As the destroyer sped into the darkness , her captain , who had never been friendly with Bart before , signaled with a small red blinker light which could be seen for only a very short distance , a message which Bart never forgot : " Well done , and good luck . " " Well done , and good luck " ; that 's what the skipper of the destroyer said , Bart told his son beneath the lilac trees ; " well done , and good luck . " And Bart kept repeating it . Alone on the raging seas , in command of a ship for the first time in his life , Bart headed for Iceland , the nearest port . The ship had been strained , they soon found , and somewhere gasoline was leaking into the bilges . The smell of gasoline was everywhere . Mr. Redding ,  | the fat engineering officer , found that the pump room was flooded with gasoline , and donning an oxygen mask , he descended into it . Standing in gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rag so it would not make a spark . At the hatch above , Bart and the other men wore rubber boots so the nails in their heels would make no spark , for a spark was all that was needed to blow them up . Listening to this on a warm summer evening , John almost smelled the gasoline fumes , and he jumped when a firefly throbbed a few feet from his nose . But the spark was avoided , and Bart brought the ship to port . As a reward he got the Navy Cross , a thirty-day leave , during which he was drunk most of the time , and later , the command of one of the first destroyer escorts built . " It was supposed to be an honor to get command of a ship so young , " Bart usually concluded , and then he sometimes would start to tell the story all over again , while his son steadily pruned the snowberries and the lilacs and hydrangeas , the big shears going clip , clip , clip . " Sure I understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was impossible to tell from his youthful face whether he really did . Oh , that was a great summer for stories . Not only did Bart tell them incessantly , but Todd Hasper , lurking with his dog behind the bushes , began to strike up conversations with John , coming to squat down beside him morosely , saying once that this was the first time he had ever seen a Hunter work , saying another time that he would n't expect such a boy from such a mother , and finally telling all the stories he knew , bringing them out gradually , giving John first a small glimmer of what he meant , and then confirming it , until in a rage one day late in August John turned on him with the pruning shears upraised and told him he did n't want to hear any more , even if it was the truth . That night John wrote Molly the first emotional letter he had ever written to anyone . He did n't mention his mother , for she had become a subject which he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own problems than he ever had before . " Dear Molly , " he said . " This is a lonely place . To tell you the truth , I 've had a lousy summer . I guess it 's pretty awful to feel sorry for myself , but I hate school too , and I do n't like the idea of going back . Do you ever get lonely or is this just something funny about me ? I do n't know what 's the matter , but it 's been a real lousy summer , and I just had to tell somebody .  | " I wish you were here and we could go sailing together . The next time I promise I wo n't capsize you . A fellow down at the other end of the island has a catamaran , and sometimes he lets me use it . " Well , that 's all for now . I 've been working in the garden all day , and I 'm pretty tired . The garden is beginning to look nice , though . Someday I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sincerely , John . " It seemed to him to be a pretty silly letter , but he felt Molly would understand , and he mailed it . 20 MOLLY WAS SITTING in an armchair near the front door of the Carters ' new house in Buffalo when the postman brought John 's letter . She usually managed to be there for the arrival of the mail , because she hated the expression on her mother 's and grandmother 's faces when either of them handed her a letter from John . The postman , the small , dark-complexioned man whom old Bruce had asked about the neighborhood , smiled at her and gave her John 's letter first , as he almost always did . Molly hurried with it to her room . Her face was serious as she read it . When she was through , she put it with a packet of John 's letters in a cigar box with a rubber band around it , which she kept carefully hidden under some spare blankets on the top shelf in her closet . Taking some new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , she lay on her stomach on her bed , and using a collection of poetry as a desk , she wrote , " Dear John , It 's lonely here too , and I certainly know how you feel . " There was the duty to write something else then , a thing which embarrassed her , but it had to be explained . " You can see by this paper , " she wrote , " that my name has been changed from Jorgenson ' to Carter . ' I do n't like this very much , but Mother and Granny seem to think it 's very important . Mother 's changing her name back to Carter ' too . I guess Jorgenson ' was n't a good name , as Mother says , but it 's a funny feeling to change it like that . Anyway , I guess you  | better address your letters to Molly Carter ' after this , because the mailman has been told about it and everything . " Molly paused . That was the part she had dreaded most to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Rereading it , she added , " This whole divorce business is pretty silly , if you ask me . Mother says we ca n't go to Pine Island again ever , so I guess I wo n't he able to go sailing with you , although I 'd love to see a catamaran . My dictionary has a good picture of one , and it looks as though it would be fun to sail . I 'd also like to see your garden . Is it the one where we looked for goldfish ? I 'm getting quite interested in some tropical fish I keep in an aquarium I have here in my room . I have two neon tetras , two black mollies , two angel fish , and some guppies . Mother says they 're disgusting , but I love to watch them swim around . I put a light over the aquarium , and the neon tetras especially shine beautifully . " Molly added a few more sentences about the fish , and finished with , " Sincerely , Molly . " Putting an airmail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweater and walked down to the mailbox at the corner . Margaret , who at seventy was still unusually spry , was on a stepladder washing windows . She watched Molly go , knowing exactly what had happened . The child always answered that boy 's letters immediately , and whenever she went out for a walk soon after the arrival of the mailman , it meant that she 'd got another one . Still carrying her polishing cloth , Margaret got down and walked to her granddaughter 's room . She did n't hurry , for it always took Molly fifteen minutes to get to the mailbox and back . Going to the closet , Margaret took down the cigar box and with practiced hands slipped off the rubber band . Standing by the window , she took her glasses from her apron pocket , and put them on . Then she read John 's latest letter through twice . When she had first started reading John 's letters , as soon as Molly had returned from boarding school in the spring , Margaret had been surprised at their innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were saying things which were n't apparent . Helen had agreed with her that it was wise to let the letters continue as long as they were carefully watched . Soon , Margaret thought , the children would betray themselves , if they were trying to put something over , which after all , would not be surprising . Things like that happen every day ,  | Margaret knew . You do n't reach the age of seventy for nothing , she often told herself . Now she read this letter from John a third time . The talk about loneliness was dangerous , she thought ; that 's the way men always began . They started by saying how lonely they were , as though all they wanted was companionship , oh sure . The talk about sailing also deserved close scrutiny , Margaret felt . Remembering the last sail John and Molly had taken together , and the way it had ended up , she felt that the reference to boats and the sentence , " Next time I promise I wo n't capsize you , " were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully and put the box back on the closet shelf under the blanket . It was time to stop this foolish correspondence , she was sure . For the last year Margaret had been worried about Molly . Already she was beginning to develop a rather startling figure . Surely it was unnatural for that to begin so young , Margaret thought ; she felt there was something almost obscene about it . Both she and Helen had always had " dainty " figures , by which Margaret meant flat-chested , and no member of the family had ever looked like Molly . It was the Swedish blood that did it , Margaret told Helen ; for although Molly had , luckily enough , inherited dear Helen 's dark hair , she was a Swede at heart , Margaret was sure , and everybody knew how the Swedes are . They walk around naked on the beaches even today , Margaret had heard , and in a magazine article she had read that they have trial marriages , and legalized abortion , which certainly was sensible enough when it was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of things . If anybody doubted that the Swedes were immoral , all they had to do was to follow the careers of the movie stars who came from Sweden , which Margaret did with malignant avidity . Although it had been a struggle , it was lucky that Helen had succeeded in convincing Molly to change her name , Margaret thought . Not only would it be inhuman to force a girl to explain why her name was different from her mother 's every time she was introduced , but it would be wrong to pin the name of an evil man like Jorgenson on an innocent girl , whether a former wife or a daughter . Helen had made a mistake in marrying Jorgenson , but there is such a thing as forgiveness , and there was no point in commemorating a sin with a name . Beyond that , a Swedish name like that for a young  | girl would be an open invitation to seduction , Margaret thought . " Jorgenson " indeed  --  how vulgar it sounded ! In spite of her good marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing poetry , Molly was really stupid , Margaret thought ; she was so slow to realize the practical advantages of a fine name like " Carter " over " Jorgenson . " The girl had insisted on " maintaining her identity , " a ridiculous phrase , for heaven 's sake , something she had picked up in one of the books she was constantly reading . It had been necessary to explain to her in some detail what an evil man Ken really was before she became convinced . All the gossip which Margaret and Helen had heard about Ken and Sylvia had had to be repeated , with all the elaborations they could devise . After reading this latest letter from that woman 's son , for heaven 's sake  --  really , you 'd think that Hunter family would be content with seducing one generation  --  Margaret went to the dining room , where Helen was polishing silver . Quickly they agreed that the time had come for the correspondence to stop . When Molly came home from the mailbox she found her mother and grandmother sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been getting more letters from John Hunter ? " Margaret began directly . " Yes , " Molly said , looking startled . " Well , your mother and I have been awfully worried about it . " " Why ? " " Well , you know , he 's a nice boy , dear , but we ca n't forget the kind of woman his mother is , and his father , you know  --  the drinking and all that . Your mother says that everybody was talking about it at the island that summer . He drinks like a fish , they say , like an absolute fish . " " What 's that got to do with John ? " " There is such a thing as bad blood , dear , " Helen said sadly . " I know it 's difficult to face , but it 's a scientific fact . " " John is n't bad ! " " No , dear , it has n't shown up yet , perhaps , but it will . And anyway , it is n't good form for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a boy . It is n't correct . " " I do n't care . " " Not now , but it 's already hurting you , dear , " Helen said . " You have n't made any friends here this summer . Peggy Talbert next door said her Anne has been quite hurt . " " I do n't like Anne Talbert. "  | " Why not ? " " She belongs to fan clubs . " " What 's the matter with that , dear ? It 's innocent fun . " " It 's goony , " Molly said . " That 's beside the point . What I 'm trying to make you understand is , these letters must stop . You may write him once more and tell him that . " " I wo n't , " Molly said . " Do n't be rude , child , " Margaret interjected . " You must honor your mother . " " You do n't have to tell him if you do n't want to , " Helen said , " but you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , " Molly said . " Are you defying us , dear ? " Helen asked , her eyes narrowing . " There 's nothing wrong in writing letters ! " " There does n't seem to be anything wrong in his letters , " Margaret said , " but if , you examine this last one closely between the lines . . . " Margaret stopped , not greatly embarrassed at having made the slip , but ' annoyed . Molly 's eyes blazed . " Have you been reading my letters ? " " It 's our duty , dear , " Helen said . " A young girl . . . Molly turned , ran to her room and locked the door . Blushing furiously , she took down the box of letters and read every one , trying to make sure there was nothing her mother and grandmother should n't have seen . No , it was only her imagination that they were love letters , but still Molly blushed . Carefully she tore the letters up in minute pieces and walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never again would she keep letters , she thought . For about an hour Molly lay on her bed , staring at the new plaster ceiling . Then she took out her letter paper , and placed it on her volume of poetry . " Dear John , " she wrote . " Mother thinks that we should n't write each other , so until I go back to school you better address me care of general delivery at the post office , and I 'll go downtown to get my mail . Otherwise there will be a stupid fuss every time a letter comes . " She wanted to stop there , but the slender black fountain pen in her hand and the white paper beckoned . A rush of thoughts came to her head , and her hand seemed to be detached from herself as it wrote , " I hate my mother and I hate my father and I hate my  | grandparents . I hate them all , every last one of them , and I hate your mother too . They 're all rotten people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if you want to , and I 'll write you . " She signed it , " Sincerely , Molly , " and knowing that she 'd tear it up if she reread it , she shoved it immediately into an envelope . Her hands shook as she addressed it . Walking through the living room , she said to Margaret , " I 've written him . No more letters will come . " " Good , dear , " Margaret said . " I knew you 'd see reason . " Molly ran down the street to the mailbox , and she clanged the metal door covering the slot defiantly after she had dropped the letter in. 21 KEN AND HELEN 'S DIVORCE soon went through the Florida courts , but it was December 1954 before Sylvia and Bart 's divorce became final . Both Sylvia and Ken won the right to have their children visit them a month a year , but it was a hollow victory , for John never even answered Sylvia 's letters any more , and Molly had stopped answering Ken now too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer saying briefly that Molly was changing her name , Ken got drunk for one of the few times in his life , and Sylvia cried . They both agreed to keep writing their children , even if they never got replies , and they did so regularly once a week , but the letters were difficult to compose . They had not seen their children for so long now , that it was like writing strangers . Children grow so fast , Sylvia said sadly . She did n't know what books to send John for his birthday , and Ken had to quit sending Molly clothes because he knew her size had changed , and anyway a Fifth Avenue shop where he and Sylvia had picked out some dresses for Molly returned his check , because they said the dresses had been sent back , and the person to whom they had been shipped declined to have alterations made or to accept replacements . Well , Sylvia said grimly , we should n't expect this sort of thing to  | be easy ; it can never be . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction that sins have to be paid for in full . He is a just God and an angry God , precisely as the Bible says , and there was proof of that enough for anyone with the wits to look around . But the Bible says there is forgiveness if there is repentance , Ken said angrily , and God knows we 've repented enough . No , Sylvia said bitterly ; perhaps it 's an Old Testament world , not New Testament , and there is only damnation . In that case , the only choice , Ken said , is to be not penitent but defiant , and what was getting into them anyway to have all this solemn talk ? " We 've got our wedding coming up , " he said . " Let us forget the divorces , and if we have to , let us forget our children . We have a life of our own to lead , and a man and woman would have to be extremely foolish to deny themselves happiness after going through so much hell to get it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we ca n't be that rational . Not you and I. Neither of us can be really happy if we know our children are miserable . It 's funny , in a way . When the children were born their happiness was in our hands , and for one reason or another , we have n't done a very good job . Now I ca n't help feeling that the tables have been turned , and in a strange way , our happiness is in their hands . There 's not going to be much for you and me , unless some day we are convinced that the children are all right . " " But that will take time ! " he replied . " Meanwhile , we have to do the best we can ! " So a wedding was planned . Sylvia said flatly that she wanted to be married in a church . She had never been religious before in her life , but now was the time . Her father had been an ardent atheist and her mother Catholic , so it seemed logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to marry them , and said that after a series of talks with her , he would accept her as a member of the church . Rather uneasily , Ken agreed to become a Congregationalist too . His father , whom he hardly remembered , had become a stern Swedenborgian , almost a fanatic , shortly before he died , when Ken was only twelve years old , and religion had terrified him ever since . The question of whom to ask to the wedding was a troublesome one . Sylvia did not like the idea of just having an official witness there ; she wanted to be surrounded by friends and relatives . But her parents were dead , and all their old friends were split into factions  | over the two divorces , and it was hard to know where anyone stood . Since she and Ken had been living together , a lot of people they knew had dropped out of sight . She wanted more than anything to have John attend the wedding ; she wanted him there so much that she telephoned him at Colchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I are getting married , " she said , her voice tight . " We want you to come . " " I have examinations , " he said , without inquiring about the date . Apparently , every contact she had with him worsened matters , because shortly after that she got a brief note from him saying that he had got a music scholarship and would n't need any financial help from her any more . The checks she sent him after that were not cashed . Molly also declined to come to the wedding , but Ken had assumed that Helen would n't let her accept . The only person who seemed happy was Carla , who acted as though a big sister were getting married to an old beau long beloved by the family . She asked if she could be a bridesmaid , and delightedly tried on dress after dress . Ken arranged for his seventy-five-year-old mother , who still lived in Nebraska , to come . Old Mrs. Jorgenson agreed to accept plane fare when he told her it would really mean a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernie Anderson and his wife said they 'd arrive " with bells on , " and sent a case of champagne with which to celebrate . While the preparations were being made Sylvia found herself making comparisons with her first wedding , and the more she remembered about it , the more horrified she became at herself . Her father 's business had not been going well , but on her mother 's insistence he had borrowed a great deal of money to make the wedding " a proper affair . " Oh , it had been proper all right . The invitations had been engraved on the most expensive paper , and the gowns for all the bridesmaids had come from Paris . Sylvia had worn " white for purity , " and Bart had ridiculed her . It had been very sophisticated to assume that no bride was pure , but there had been more to it than that , Sylvia realized : Bart had known perfectly well from the beginning that she did n't love him . He had got hopelessly drunk the day before the wedding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else , if she had ever loved anyone else , and she had said no , thinking that was the truth , almost . Bewildered by her coldness  | toward him , Bart had boasted of his virility . At one time or another , he had slept with every one of the bridesmaids she had picked , he had said , standing before her on the day before the ceremony , so drunk he could hardly stand up . They were all Pine Island girls , and the Hunters always exercised the droit du seigneur , he had claimed , and Sylvia had realized that in a sense he was right ; he probably had slept with most of her bridesmaids , or come close to it . The old rules about not " getting serious " and not " going all the way " had applied only to teen-agers , and the parties on the island had been getting wilder lately . The knowledge of this had made her first wedding a parody ; it had been necessary to be very sophisticated , to smile as she leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile had been hard to maintain as she followed her procession of pretty bridesmaids down the aisle to stand beside Bart at the altar . It had been difficult to look amused when he dropped the ring , obviously because he was drunk , not nervous . In the middle of the night before her second wedding Sylvia covered her face with her hands when she remembered this . Suddenly all Bart 's troubles seemed her fault  --  she had caused his drunkenness , and the misery of the children ; she had put Ken through a special kind of hell ; and she had been evil from start to finish , she thought Smothering her face in her pillow , Sylvia started to cry . But the second wedding on January 31 was much different . Her only bridesmaid was Carla , a chubby young girl in a new white dress ; and instead of leaning on the arm of her debt-worried father , she now had the strong arm of Bernie Anderson , who had gone out and licked the world , but who looked a little like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes . And instead of Bart standing stiffly at attention while he swayed by the altar like a tin soldier too loosely attached to its base , there was Ken , big and relaxed , with a quiet smile upon his face . Except for Bernie 's wife , Rachel , and Ken 's mother , no one was sitting in the church , and the rows of empty pews seemed to extend back to infinity through the shadows ; the darkened ceiling seemed to arch up to the sky itself . Behind the altar there were fourteen candles and a golden cross . On one stained-glass window was a poorly rendered picture of a shepherd and a lamb , and on another was Christ on a cross , his face tortured and compassionate . All this  | appeared beautiful to Sylvia . There was no music , and she felt none was needed . An old minister with a tired face stood on a raised platform near the altar , towering above Ken and Sylvia . Ken 's mother started to weep , emitting tiny snuffling sounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassuring hand on the old lady 's shoulder . " Dearly beloved , " the minister said , reading from a small red prayer book , " We are gathered here in the sight of God , and in the face of this company , to join together this Man and this Woman in Holy Matrimony ; which is an honourable estate , instituted of God .. The ceremony did n't last very long . The minister 's voice was mellifluous but subdued ; outside the church a fire engine whined in the distance . Ken glanced at Sylvia . She was pale . When she said , " I do , " her voice was clear but faint , contrasting strongly with Ken 's basso profundo " I do , " which echoed through the church like an organ note . " Let us pray , " the minister said . After the wedding Sylvia , Ken and Carla went to live in France , where Ken had work to do with Bernie Anderson . A year or two abroad would do them both good , he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time they got back . Sylvia felt bad because she had no source of news concerning John ; he might be terribly sick and she might not hear about it in time to get there , and she was sure he would want her if he fell ill . She had nightmares of his dying and calling for her . Before sailing she had premonitions of disaster so acute that she telephoned Colchester Academy to see if he was all right . The absence of news about his daughter bothered Ken too , and acting on a sudden inspiration , he wrote Mr. Caulfield , and Miss Summerfield , the headmistress of Briarwood Manor , asking to subscribe to the school newspapers , the yearbooks , the literary magazines  --  in short , any publication in which the children 's names or pictures might appear . Soon after they got to their apartment in Paris , a stack of these materials arrived , and more came every month . From the Colchester Academy Arrow they learned , to their surprise , that John , who was then in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boxing team , the pianist and singer for the school band ( " Say , Bing and Frank , move over ! " a campus gossip columnist wrote ) , and that  | he was on the dean 's list , with top marks . Molly was n't mentioned much in her school newspaper , but a copy of the Briarwood Literary Review which arrived in March 1955 , after Ken and Sylvia had been in France three months , carried a small poem by Molly Carter . It read , Ken found to his astonishment , as follows : NO BY MOLLY CARTER Sometimes I do not want the world to know That I exist . I want to see but not be seen Like gulls in mist . I envy arctic things upon the snow , White bear , the fox . In jungles I would like to be pure green And gray on rocks . I know some people want to be admired Or to be kissed , But I find too much heartache is required . Do not insist . " Is n't that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write ? " Ken asked Sylvia . " Do n't forget that she 's almost sixteen now , " Sylvia said . " Were n't you writing love poems in Latin when you were only a little older ? " " Yes , " Ken said bewilderedly , " but they were n't that good , and anyway , I never wrote a poem called No . ' All mine said Yes . " ' Sylvia laughed . " Molly 's a girl , " she said . 22 MOLLY WROTE A LOT of verse that year . It was easier for her to say things she felt deeply in that impersonal way than in letters . At boarding school she was a solitary child and all sorts of things were happening which disturbed her .  | In the first place , there was the matter of popularity . Everyone kept saying how important it was to be popular , especially at the dances the school held once a month in conjunction with Teaberry Academy , a boys ' boarding school in a nearby Virginia town . To Molly these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wallflower , far from it . There was always a procession of boys waiting to cut in on her . It was easy to make friends , but the difficulty was in keeping them , in overcoming her shyness . When dancing , Molly held herself sti 1 y erect in the boy 's arms , and although she learned to make small talk , her voice sounded mechanical . When , as sometimes happened , a boy tried to squeeze her too tight , or allowed his hand to move around to the side of her breast , she had all she could do to keep herself from breaking away in panic . Almost always the boys kept telling her how pretty she was , how beautiful , how absolutely terrific , and she was never sure how to reply . At first she thought modesty demanded denials , and she said , " Oh no , I 'm not , " or , " Oh , go on , " but that sounded silly . " Thank you , " she ended up by saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize how cold she made that sound . Although there were always plenty of new boys to dance with her , they did n't come back many times , and this hurt Molly . There was one earnest boy with glasses who was able to quote A. E. Housman 's poems , which she had been studying , and she liked to talk to him ; but he was one of the ones whose hands kept straying toward her breast when they danced , and conversation with him soon became impossible . Even when they sat out dances together he seemed to be under great emotional stress , and it was n't long before he began avoiding her , the way most of the others did . Once at a dance she heard one boy say to another , " Sure , she 's a knockout , but all ice . " Girls did n't like Molly , either . They thought her stuck-up , because of both her looks and her grades , which usually were the best at the school . She rarely laughed and never joined in dormitory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her paleness , the delicate bone structure of her face , her habit of holding herself so erect , and her almost constant silence made her appear to her classmates to be aristocratic and aloof . As Ken saw in her school yearbook , her nickname was " the Countess , " and as he guessed , it was n't meant to be kind . So Molly stayed by herself , studying , reading far more than her courses required , and pouring out letters to John . When she began writing poetry she sent him a few restrained verses , and his letters of  | appreciation were enthusiastic . Gradually she began mailing him evasything she wrote . The only trouble was it embarrassed her to think of some of the poems which dealt , however mildly , with love . When John wrote her that be would like to hitchhike to Virginia to see her , vicl that he was sure a meeting could be arranged without her mother ding out , she became terrified . She was sure she would blush piteously when she saw him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that he would like her after the first meeting y more than the other boys did . He might go away disappointed , d then their correspondence , the greatest pleasure in her life , indeed , the only one , would stop . Still another danger was that she herself might be disillusioned by John , now that they had both grown older . As things were , she imagined him as tall , handsome and kind , perfect in every respect , and she suspected he might turn out to be something else . She wrote him that the school had very strict rules against male callers ; it was practically a nunnery , she said , and there would be all kinds of trouble if he came . A little later she sent him the poem entitled " No , " which was published in her school literary magazine . John was hurt and puzzled by her refusal to see him , but a little relieved , for though his complexion had cleared up during the past year , it still was n't perfect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him right away . He liked the poem . It sounded almost like a song , he thought , and when he reread it , the beginnings of a melody seemed to be stirring deep down in him , teasing him to try to write it down . John 's interest in music was increasing . He practiced on the piano two hours a day , and played in the school band at all the dances . One small advantage of this was that he did n't have to dance . In spite of his acute sense of rhythm and the inherent elegance of movement which he shared with his father , John , even at sixteen , found that he got so confused when he danced that his feet tangled . The girls ' perfume bothered him ; the very idea of their being so close to him threw him into a panic ; their soft dresses and the feeling of his hand on a girl 's shoulder or back , this was all too much to be borne calmly . Dancing inspired a rush of thoughts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stumblefooted as though he were drunk . But at the piano John was a different person . There he was no longer earthbound ; he could glide and fly and soar . He could make  | love to a girl on the piano , very delicately with the little high notes , and passionately with the pounding basses , and often when he put his head back and sang , the dancers stopped and gathered around to listen . His clear tenor voice was so charged with emotion that it made the tired words of old Tin Pan Alley songs flash into life . His singing appeared effortless , as though all he had to do was just sit there and let the music pour out . Playing at the dances John often forgot his audience entirely . When he looked up after finishing a song and saw the semicircle of faces around him , he sometimes blushed , as though he had been caught naked . The girls from Miss Arden 's Academy in Hartford were always teasing John , trying to get him to dance . They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever found out , because John was too embarrassed to try . For months John had been trying to compose a song . He had sat up half the night in his dormitory after the lights were supposed to be out , holding a flashlight under a blanket , staring at the neatly lined music paper and painstakingly writing down notes . The results were so bad that he had given up , but Molly 's poem , " No , " teased him to try again . For two weeks he worked on his song in every spare moment , and when it was finished it was a long way from great , he was quite aware , but it was n't a bad little tune . The only trouble was that Molly 's words did n't seem to go very well with it  --  it bothered him to sing or to write as though he were Molly ; he wanted to sing about her . Hoping she would n't mind , he changed the words a little . He was n't as good at writing verse as she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her " Sincerely yours , " the words were pretty embarrassing for him to set down ; but in a song he hoped such talk was permissible . This is what he wrote : NO LYRICS BASED ON POEM . BY MOLLY CARTER MUSIC BY JOHN HUNTER My Molly does n't want the world to know Her charms exist . She wants to see but not be seen Like gulls in mist . She envies arctic things upon the snow , White bear , the fox ;  | She envies jungle birds whose hue is green Or gray on rocks . My Molly does n't want to be admired Or to be kissed . Of me I fear she 'll soon get sick and tired For I insist . John blushed painfully when he reread it , and he became enraged when Dick Woller caught him singing it at the piano . For weeks he polished the music , putting off the decision of whether to send it to her , but finally , in March of 1955 , he mailed it . Molly was both embarrassed and pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Sunday morning she crept into the common room at her school when no one was there , and sat down at the piano . She could n't play well , and it took her an hour to pick out the tune with two fingers . After she had caught the melody she ran through it ten or twelve times . Played with two fingers , it had its limitations , but she thought it sounded pretty good . 23 THAT SPRING Helen decided to satisfy a lifelong ambition and buy a Cadillac . There was no reason why she should n't , her mother said . After all , she had n't yet done a thing to celebrate her freedom from Ken , and if anyone had earned a Cadillac , God knew she had . Old Bruce was commissioned to buy the car . He had always prided himself on being able to purchase anything cheaper than anyone else could , especially automobiles , and he began touring every Cadillac garage in the Buffalo area . He and his wife and daughter read all the brochures available , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eldorados and the other models . Helen had a clear idea of what she wanted : the biggest and most impressive limousine made , but she felt she could n't say that . When Bruce drove smaller models up to the house to demonstrate ,  | she said , " Do n't we need more room , Dad ? I mean , some day we might take a long trip . " Finally Bruce found the exactly right car , an immense black limousine which had been used by an undertaker to carry mourners in funeral processions . The undertaker himself had recently died , and the car was only a year old , a much better buy , Bruce said , than a new one , and after all , it had hardly ever been driven at more than twenty miles an hour . Helen and Margaret were ecstatic . Sitting on the soft gray upholstery of its back seat , they felt like duchesses . The car also had a marvelous device , a telephone connecting the rear seat with a small speaker over the driver 's head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found it a joy to sit comfortably back with the telephone at her lips , a great improvement over the old days , when she had had to lean forward and raise her voice when she wanted to berate her husband . Bruce enjoyed the telephone too . The second day they owned the car , he took it back to the garage " for a checkup " and had a switch installed beneath the little speaker . It gave him a wonderful feeling to let Margaret talk for a few minutes and then , with a touch of a finger , to shut her off . When he did n't answer her through the mouthpiece attached to the dashboard in front of him , she spoke loudly enough to be heard without the telephone , but Margaret had long been used to one-way conversations with her husband , and if he just nodded his head a little from time to time , the secret switch protected him from most of her comments . They all loved the car , and decided that as soon as Molly 's summer vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the Grand Canyon and to visit several distant relatives in Wisconsin who might be expected to be properly flabbergasted by their mode of travel . In June they drove to Briarwood to pick up Molly at her school , and immediately set off for the West . Molly spent most of the summer sitting beside her grandfather in the front seat , or standing with dutiful awe before national monuments . Sometimes they covered as much as six hundred miles a day , and as old Bruce often said , it would have been a terrible trip in any car but a Cadillac . John started that summer as an unpaid counselor at Camp Mantawana in Maine . Bart 's drinking habits had not improved , and his conscience bothered him less when his son was not around . Camp Mantawana was run by Mr. Newfield , the teacher at Colchester Academy who had befriended Bill Norris . Some of the boys at the  | camp were the sons of parents in large cities who worked hard to help their children to escape the heat , but others had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the youngsters at Mantawana simply shuttled from summer camp to boarding school and back again , seeing one divorced parent or another only for an occasional weekend , or for Christmas . Through long experience , Mr. Newfield and Dora , his sweet-faced wife , recognized these lonely youngsters at a glance , and treated them with special kindness . When a boy was discovered crying at night , Mr. Newfield often took him into his own cottage , and Dora would quickly slip on her bathrobe to prepare hot chocolate . It was surprising what Dora could do with a cup of hot chocolate and her soft , understanding eyes . In search of the rare talents he needed , Mr. Newfield picked his counselors carefully , and kept a sharp eye on them . Before the end of July he promoted John to Senior Counselor , with a small salary , and asked him to help with some of the more difficult cases . There was , for instance , the son of a famous actress , a boy named Teddy , who at ten was painfully fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have rubber sheets . If the others had found out about the rubber sheets , Teddy would have been unmercifully ridiculed , so it fell to John to change the sheets secretly , slipping them quickly into a canvas bag . To facilitate this operation , John moved Teddy 's cot into a corner suitably screened from the others by a large chest of drawers . One of Teddy 's difficulties was that no one wanted him for a partner when the boys were divided into mutually protective pairs for swimming . Feeling hurt , Teddy refused to swim at all , and on even the hottest days , remained sweating on the shore . It was John 's job to try to sound convincing when he invited Teddy to go swimming with him on the pretext that he himself did n't want to go swimming alone . John was so successful with Teddy that , before long , the boy was following him around like a large , mournful puppy . Mr. Newfield congratulated John and put him unofficially in charge of a whole group of misfits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of fourteen , a frantic little bully who got into fights almost every day , a stutterer , and a child suffering from a mild form of kleptomania . Finding that exhaustion appeared to be at least a temporary help to everyone 's problems , John often took his charges on long hikes over mountain trails and country roads . They made up an  | oddly bedraggled little army as they trudged along in their green uniforms , with their canteens wagging at their belts and their knapsacks bobbing on their backs . They liked to sing , John found , and there was curious pathos in their cracking voices as they piped , " Over hill , over dale , we will hit the dusty trail ... " Late in August Teddy 's mother arrived in a red sports car to visit her son and to introduce a new father , his third . A striking blonde who looked almost as good as her photographs , she seemed markedly ill at ease as she strolled with Teddy under the tall pine trees which ringed the camp . Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her husband , a small man who was beginning to get bald , took John aside . " We 're very grateful for what you 've done for the boy , " he said nervously , and slipped a hundred-dollar bill into John 's hand . Then he got in his sports car with his wife , adjusted a plaid cap on his bald spot , and they drove off with the engine roaring . That night it was necessary to give Teddy several cups of hot chocolate . " You show unusual sensitivity in dealing with troubled children , " Mr. Newfield said to John gravely a week later . " Have you ever thought of going into teaching ? " " I have n't really made up my mind what I want to do , " John replied to avoid hurting Mr. Newfield 's feelings , but he knew he did n't want to be a teacher . The loneliness of his charges increased his own until sometimes be grew so restless that he could n't stand still . The desire to escape the oppressive atmosphere of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cot to take a stroll in the woods . His walk soon turned into a run , until he was zigzagging through the trees like a wild thing in full flight , with the branches whipping his face , and his breath coming hot . Finally he tired himself out and walked back in the moonlight to take a shower and try to sleep . John could n't write Molly often that summer because her address was constantly changing . The communications he received from her were briefer than usual , because Molly had to share motel rooms with her mother , and had scant privacy in which to write . Often she sent postcards which she had hastily scrawled in lavatories . Wherever her family stayed more than a night , Molly insisted upon being allowed to take a walk alone , and sitting in some secluded spot with a pad , she wrote John descriptions of the sights she had seen . One long letter was devoted almost entirely to Bruce 's switch on the telephone , which Molly had observed without betraying the secret . She  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight face while Margaret droned criticisms of Bruce 's driving into the mouthpiece , and the old man sat at the wheel with a happy smile . From time to time he reached up and turned the speaker on for a few moments just to have the pleasure of flicking it off . Other than this , the tone of Molly 's letters was somber . " I try to think about the old settlers who crossed this country in oxcarts , and how brave they were , " she wrote once . " I wish I could be like them . " On the first of September Helen returned with her family to Buffalo , and John was able to resume his half of the correspondence . His first missive was as close to a love letter as he had ever come . " Dear Molly , " he wrote , " I ca n't stand this business of not seeing you much longer . I 'll be through here at camp next Monday , and Dad would never know the difference if I took a few days off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't I come up to Buffalo to see you ? I have a little money now and would like to make the trip . If we had to , we could meet some place away from your home . I hope more than anything that we can arrange something like that . It 's been more than a year now ! Please try to think of some place we can meet , and I 'll be there any time you say . " He signed it , " Sincerely , John , " and addressed it " General Delivery , Buffalo , N.Y. , " as she had asked him to do . When Molly read this letter she was not surprised . In spite of her fears , she had been hoping that he would ask to see her again , and on the long drive across the continent , she had enjoyed thinking about what she would do if he did . Locking herself in her room , she took out her paper and without hesitation wrote , " Dear Johnny , I certainly would like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long trip . " She paused and tried to think of a good place to meet . Delaware Park would be nice , but what would happen if it rained ? She had a vision of standing there in a pouring rain waiting for him , and that would n't be good at all . A movie house ? It would be awkward to wait in the lobby with people walking by , any one of whom she might know . Suddenly she had an idea . Outside a small Catholic church which she had often passed on her way to the post office was a sign giving the schedule of Sunday services with the notice , " Always open to the public for meditation and for prayer . " Molly , who had been told by her mother and grandparents that Catholicism was wrong , had once been driven by curiosity to go there . Surprised to find that the interior did not look entirely unlike  | that of the Methodist church her mother attended , she had sat there for a half hour in the dim light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the flicker of candles . Now the idea occurred to her that this church would be a good place to meet John . It appealed to her esthetically , and had the further advantage , she thought wryly , of being the least likely place to run into any of her mother 's friends . " St. Mark 's Church on Cottonwood Avenue is open all the time , " she wrote John . " I 'll meet you in the right-hand pew nearest the door as soon as you arrive . Just let me know the day and time . " By return mail John replied that he could get there by the following Tuesday , and that his train reached Buffalo early in the morning . " I 'll have breakfast at the station , " he said , " and if it 's all right , I 'll meet you at the church at nine o'clock . " Molly told Helen and Margaret that the Halseys , whose daughter , Susan , also went to Briarwood Manor , had asked her to join them for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge old mansion on Delaware Avenue , and Margaret had been hoping that Molly would get an invitation from them . " That 's the advantage of a place like Briarwood , " Margaret told Helen . " By going there , she 'll meet the best people here . " Neither Margaret nor Helen made any objection when Molly said the Halseys were sending a taxi for her at a quarter of nine in the morning . The hour and the use of a taxi seemed a little peculiar , but who were they to question what people like the Halseys did ? Molly awoke at seven that Tuesday and was glad she had chosen the church as a meeting place , for although it was not yet raining , it was cold and gray . She put on a blue dress which she had chosen carefully the night before , and sat brushing her hair for a half hour . She was n't at all hungry , but she forced herself to drink a glass of milk . Twenty minutes before the taxi which she had called arrived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lap . When Helen and Margaret come downstairs with Bruce for breakfast , they noticed that Molly looked a little nervous , but who would n't be , with the prospect of a day with the Halseys ahead ? " You look very nice , dear , " Helen said . " You never will have to worry about your appearance in any company . " " Thank you , Mother , " Molly replied . When the taxi finally drew up in front of the house , Molly threw on her coat and dashed to it , only to find before getting in that she  | had forgotten her handbag . After returning for that , she entered the cab and sat back with relief . There was no fear that her mother would check with the Halseys , because Helen did n't know them , and would be too ill at ease to call them in any but the most dire emergency . Molly sighed , and took from her handbag a lipstick . Staring into a small mirror , she applied it with the utmost concentration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the church , and she was dismayed to find that a funeral was in progress . A hearse was drawn up nearby , and a knot of men in formal clothes stood near the door . Molly paid the taxi-driver , turned and hesitated . Then she saw a young man dressed in a tan trench coat without a hat come across the sidewalk toward her , and recognized him as John  --  the angular features , the way he walked , yes , it was John , who looked frighteningly sophisticated to her now , and older . He hurried up and stood two feet away from her with his arms held tensely at his sides , and all he said was , " Molly . " " Hello , " she replied . A tired-appearing man in a swallow-tailed coat and striped trousers came toward them with a grave look and said , " Are you members of the family ? " " No , " John said . " I 'm sorry . " He touched Molly 's arm , and they started walking down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funeral there , " Molly said to him , her own voice sounding unaccountably strange to her . " I do n't mind funerals , " he replied . That sounded peculiar , and he added , " I mean when they 're somebody else 's . " That sounded worse . " I mean they do n't upset me when somebody I do n't know is being buried , " he concluded lamely . " I feel that way too , " she replied . They walked for another minute before they realized they had not the slightest idea where they were going . It was too cold for the park , and at that hour in the morning , it would be hard to find a movie open . " Would you like a Coke ? " he asked suddenly . " Sure , " she said . " There 's a drugstore just down the block . " They sat across the table from each other in a booth and she took off her coat . He did not say he thought she was beautiful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cola from large glasses , and suddenly she heard herself chattering about the Grand Canyon ,  | and Old Faithful , and the bears which came right up to the car and ate sandwiches out of her hand . After an hour and two Coca Colas they felt self-conscious about remaining in the drugstore so long , and moved on to another one . In all , they visited four such establishments that morning and as an admittance fee purchased more Coca Cola than they could drink . At noon he took her to a good restaurant . It seemed important to him to order a festive meal . Somewhere he had read the phrase , " pheasant under glass , " and trying to sound matter-of-fact , he asked the waiter if it were available . Finding it was not , he ordered huge steaks which neither of them felt like eating . Sitting across the table from each other , they suffered a curious reversal of roles . John , who had always been voluble , found it almost impossible to talk , and when he tried , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements into nonsense . In spite of the photographs they had exchanged , it was difficult for him to believe she looked the way she did . What seemed to him to be her astonishing maturity and her intense beauty brought him small delight . Instead , these qualities caused his heart to sink , for they made her seem distant to him and unattainable . He imagined her being besieged by platoons of men who looked like movie stars . Already he had a clear picture in his mind of Molly in a formal wedding gown standing at a church door beside some enormous paragon of a man . Girls usually get married much younger than men do , and she would never wait for him , he was convinced . Yes , she would be lost to him , and it would be wise to start getting used to that idea now . And what does one do when one is sitting across the table from a girl like that ? One can not stare at her , and one can not look at one 's plate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly , who at school and home was habitually reticent , responded by talking constantly . The thought of a moment of silence terrified her . After she had told John about her trip , she found herself prattling about the Buffalo weather , which was caused by warm air from the Middle Western plain meeting cold air from the Great Lakes and Canada , creating a cloud belt , she said seriously , or at least , that 's what somebody had told her , and there had to be some explanation for the scarcity of bright days , did n't he think ? When the meal arrived , she heard herself say , " That certainly looks marvelous , does n't it ? I 'm glad you like rare steaks too . I wonder where they get steaks like this ? They 're Black Angus , I guess . In Texas they have mostly  | Longhorns , or at least they used to . I think cattle are an interesting subject , do n't you ? I 'd like to learn more about them . " Yes , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was grateful when she plunged on , saying she would like to live on a farm some day , but cities are nice too . After luncheon they continued to walk the streets . A cold drizzle began and they turned into the first movie theater they came to . The first half of the double feature was about a collie dog which was smarter than all the people , and the second film was about a debonair detective who never showed the slightest fear , even when in a dark house full of murderers . They observed this without comment . When they came out of the theater it was only three-thirty and it was raining quite hard , so they decided to go to another double feature . It was dark and still raining when they emerged from that . Standing under the marquee , they looked at the lights reflected on the black streets . A taxi drew up in front of them . " Cab ? " the driver asked . " I guess so , " John replied . " I can leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station . " On the way to her house the silence was such that even Molly could n't break it . Everything she thought of saying sounded absurd , and she ached to have the visit end on a proper note . Remembering the way she had prattled , she blushed in the darkness . " Molly , " he blurted out as the cab approached her house , " can I see you again ? " " School starts next week , " she said , having worked all this out in her mind during the day . " I change trains in New York . Sometimes I have a couple of hours ... " So it was arranged . The cab stopped before her house , and just before she got out , he squeezed her hand . " Thank you ! " he said , knowing that did n't sound right , but repeating it anyway . " Thank you very much ! " Her reply , which also sounded wrong , was , " I 'm sorry ! " meaning I 'm sorry the day did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , I 'm sorry I ca n't ask you to my house . " I 'm sorry you had to come so far , " she added , jumped quickly from the cab , and fled . They saw each other three times during the next few months , once when she was on her way to school later in September , and both before and after her Christmas vacation . The meetings continued to be strained , for they never had enough time together to recover fully from the strangeness of meeting after long absence . They had luncheon  | in the Pennsylvania Station . They inspected the giant Christmas tree and the skating at Rockefeller Plaza ; they listened to a choir sing hymns in Grand Central Terminal , and they sat in the wailing room talking earnestly there till it was time for her train to go . Nothing was said between them which either of them remembered . The important things could not be talked about . They never mentioned their parents , nor long-range plans about the future . A casual onlooker might have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously frustrating to experience , and although they were difficult and expensive for John to arrange , they were a great pleasure to remember and to anticipate . If it were n't for Susan Halsey , they doubtless would have continued . Susan , a scrawny girl with a pinched , lonely face , developed an attachment for Molly , and wanted to travel with her on the way to and from school . It proved impossible to keep from her the fact that Molly was meeting John between trains in New York . Susan was touchingly eager to co-operate when she found out about it . Molly seemed to her to be a figure of romance , and she liked to think about her having a passionate love affair . The whole situation seemed wonderful to her , much too wonderful to keep from her friends . She told only her best friends , of course , or girls she hoped would become friends , for Susan had been unpopular , but as she always said before repealing the story , she never told it to anyone who could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news that Molly Carter regularly met a very handsome boy between trains in New York was common gossip throughout the school . Some of the older girls added elaborations about night clubs and hotels . At sixteen Molly had a figure which seemed to make a platonic love affair implausible , and her reticence among the other girls struck many as secretiveness . Still waters run deep , a tall senior a year older than Molly observed , and confided to Molly that she herself had n't been a virgin for three years . It was n't long before the story of . Molly 's great romance reached the ears of Miss Summerfield , the headmistress . Usually she let such gossip die a natural death , but this rumor kept mounting until she felt she had to do something about it . Although Miss Summerfield had in one of her more earthy moments observed to a colleague that running a girls ' boarding school was worse than trying to run herd on an entire pack of bitches in heat , she displayed small humor to the girls and their parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perfectly willing to believe in her innocence , it was not good form for a young lady to meet a young man alone in New York , and that she would have to take the matter up with her mother if it did n't stop . " And I 'll know , dear , if it does n't stop , " Miss Summerfield concluded . " You 'll find that in actual life , secrets are very difficult to keep . " Perhaps not in actual life , Molly observed to herself , but certainly she had no hope of keeping secrets at Briarwood Manor . Most of the student body went through the New York stations before and after vacations , and speculation about Molly 's trysts had reached such a point that she felt herself to have no more privacy than a Golden Plover surrounded by bird watchers . All this embarrassed Molly greatly , and the letter she wrote to John about it was awkward . Certainly she could n't repeat to him the nature of the rumors which had been circulating , and it was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Summerfield notified her . Molly did n't know what her mother and grandmother would do in such an eventuality , but she was sure it would be ghastly . She shrank almost physically from the prospect of discussing John with Helen and Margaret . Such a conversation would be punishment enough . Furthermore , she was quite sure that if her mother heard she had been seeing John , new steps would be taken to make it harder to see or even hear from him again . In March of 1956 , Molly wrote John that they could n't meet in New York before or after their Easter vacation , and her explanation did n't sound convincing to him . The gossip of silly girls and the fear of the reprisals of old women would n't dissuade Molly if she really wanted to see me , he thought , and the fear came rushing up in him that she was tiring of him , that her excuses would continue now whenever he wanted to see her , that the kind-as-possible letdown he had so long expected was beginning . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychology of women , oh , he was realistic about it , and did n't fool himself at all . The boys at Colchester Academy talked a great deal about this subject , and it was widely known that a woman will do anything for a man she loves , and any display of caution is proof of a lack of passion . John imagined many reasons why Molly did n't want him to come to New York to see her any more . His love for her had betrayed him , he was sure  --  he probably had been so obvious , it had undoubtedly shown in his eyes and in the tone of his voice , and Dick Woller might be at least partly  | right when he said that no woman really respects a man who loves her , that most women want a man to be casual , a little rough or even cruel . John had been too awkward and stumble-tongued , he felt , and the last time he had seen Molly , he had been having a little trouble with his complexion again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that girls were contemptuous of men who did n't make passes at them , and maybe Molly thought he was too timid . But then again he had held her hand awfully tight in the movies the last time , and maybe she thought he was getting too fresh . Worst of all , she probably had met another man , someone at college , probably , with a car of his own , who could run up to Virginia and bring her to football weekends and dances , who would n't expect her to sit around in waiting rooms of railroad stations with him , or to endure one double feature after another . Soon she would probably marry someone like that , John thought in despair , someone who was n't afraid to try to kiss her . Women really are just animals , Dick Woller had said ; and although that scarcely seemed plausible with respect to Molly , maybe Dick was at least a little right . What really affects a woman is not kindness nor steadiness nor intelligence nor even a man 's looks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sex appeal , and some guys have it and some guys do n't . Muscles are n't at all sexy to a woman  --  it 's just a certain something , Dick Woller had concluded , and he had smirked . John was n't at all sure what that certain something was , but he was quite sure he did n't have it . At any rate , he felt Molly could n't think of him as he thought of her , or she would n't have cut off the meetings . Probably he had bored her , and she had just been trying to be nice . In despair he sat down and wrote her a note held short by pride saying he had received her letter about not meeting in New York , and that he understood . In the stern resolve not to press himself upon Molly , John did not suggest any more meetings . When summer came , he went back to Mr. Newfield 's camp in Maine as a Senior Counselor . Often she wrote him from Buffalo , but she did not ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of knowing that she was afraid he no longer wanted to come .  | 24 KEN AND SYLVIA returned from Europe in October of 1956 . Ken wrote Molly a letter which was different from his weekly bulletins to her about books and plays he had enjoyed . He wrote : DEAR MOLLY , Sylvia and I have bought a small house in Redding , Connecticut , and I would like you to visit us there , or in Florida . I can easily understand how these divorces have been hard on you children , and a certain amount of bitterness is inevitable , but I frankly think that two years of this foolishness about your refusing to answer my letters is about enough . Judging from your verse in your school 's literary review , which I 've subscribed to , and from all I know about you , you 're a remarkably mature and sensitive young lady . After all , you 're almost seventeen years old now . You 're growing up , and do you propose to avoid your father for the rest of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book who did that ? Would n't she appear cruel and a little smug to you , not just righteous ? Sometimes it helps to think of yourself in the third person , to pretend you 're a character in a story . Now , I ask you , do you think a real heroine would be so hurt by her father divorcing her mother that she would refuse to see him ever ? A child , yes , but an adult , no , and you 're becoming an adult . Sylvia is writing about the same thing as this to John , who 's being just as difficult as you , and I propose that the four of us get together during your Christmas or spring vacation , or any other time you choose . I am suggesting two weeks of lying in the sun and getting back to normal . We 've all had enough hating lately , and it 's time to relax . How about it , baby ? Are you your old man 's daughter or not ? All my love , DAD The letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casualness whether she were going to Florida for Christmas , she said she would . The plans were all made when Margaret Carter had her accident . On November second the postman delivered a package to the Carter  | house from a shop in Buffalo that framed pictures . It contained a framed scroll Molly had received from her school as a poetry prize . If Molly had known her mother would have it framed , she would never have sent it to her . As it was , Molly had hesitated , but any printed honor meant so much to Helen and Margaret that it would have been cruel to refuse , and anyway , they had made fun of her locking herself in her room to write poetry for so long that there were aspects of vindictiveness and practical self-defense in mailing them her pay , the fancy , illuminated scroll . Maybe it would cause them to let her alone . When she unwrapped the frame scroll , old Margaret stood looking around the house , wondering where she should hang it . The living room seemed best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble with her studies at the local high school , and Peggy Talbert , her snooty mother , would die when she saw it . Ordinarily Margaret would have waited until Bruce came home , for he did all small chores like hanging pictures , but he was at the wrestling matches . Since his retirement , he did little but attend prize fights and wrestling matches ; it was almost impossible to keep him in the house . Helen was at a meeting of the Daughters of the American Revolution , and Peggy Talbert was there too . Margaret suspected that Helen would ask Peggy in for a cup of tea when she drove her home ; Peggy had been only too glad to accept the invitation to ride in Helen 's Cadillac , and why not , Margaret thought ; that old Plymouth of the Talbert ? was nothing in which to ride to a meeting of the Daughters of the American Revolution . Anyway , Helen would probably ask Peggy in for tea when they got home , and Margaret wanted that scroll Molly had won to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a good conversation piece . In the new house Ken had bought her there was a molding around the top of each wall from which to hang pictures . Margaret got the stepladder from the utility room and balancing herself precariously , climbed up there to hang Molly 's scroll . As she put her fingers on the top of the molding , she made a horrifying discovery : the thin strip of wood , which was about three inches from the ceiling , was covered with dust and dirt . The thought that the four walls of each of the twelve rooms in the house had such moldings , all of them concealing filth , was dizzying to Margaret . She was tired and vertigo had been bothering her a lot lately , but she was scared by the possibility that Peggy Talbert might find out about that dirt  --  that she might  | climb up there to run her finger along the molding when no one was in the room , and then tell everyone about it  --  this would be unthinkable disgrace . Margaret had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of great difficulty . Tying a bandanna around her hair , she prepared herself for action , and unlimbered her vacuum cleaner . Four walls in twelve rooms contained many hundred feet of molding , and the stepladder was heavy for an old woman . The suction pipe of the vacuum cleaner was awkward to lift up to the ceiling ; the hose was too short , and the wire kept getting twisted as Margaret tried to pull the machine along the floor . She leaned out as far as she could from the top of the stepladder to clean as much space as possible before having to climb down and move all her equipment farther along the wall . It was a desperate battle , but in her lust to get at the dirt , Margaret had superhuman energy . She might have got the molding , in the living room at least , completely clean , if the hose of the vacuum cleaner had not wound around her legs like a snake . She fell from the top of the stepladder with her arms outstretched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal cylinder of the vacuum cleaner on the floor . The machine kept purring , and when Helen came in two hours later , it was keening over her as though she were dead . But she was n't . She was only hopelessly injured at the age of seventy-two  --  with a badly fractured skull and three broken ribs and a triple-broken leg . An ambulance took her to the hospital , where she lay unconscious for three days . When she came to , she insisted upon being taken home . The doctors said it was inadvisable for a person so ill to go home , but the fact that the nurses and attendants did n't pay much attention to her , except to attend to her bodily needs , infuriated her , and she raised so much hell that the doctors decided she might as well die at home as anywhere else . Margaret was established in state in her big bedroom , with a radio and a television set and an air conditioner and a large dinner bell which she was supposed to use if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone waited on Margaret because the doctors said that she would live only a few weeks at most and her last days on earth should be made as pleasant as possible , poor dear ; anyone could see that . Only she did n't die quickly ; weeks went by , and she was still there , loudly clanging her dinner bell . Helen began to hope ( certainly the word was not " fear " ) that she was eternal , that she would  | recover , in spite of what the doctors said , and lie there forever complaining that no one cared about a poor dying old woman , no one cared at all , not even her husband , who still spent most of his time at athletic events ; oh , he was a great sportsman , Bruce was , Margaret said . It was a great comfort to have her mother home , Helen told her friends ; having her with them in her last days meant a great deal . Of course , one difficulty was that Margaret abused the nurses so much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to give her mother the sponge baths and all the rest of it , but it was a great joy to tend her mother herself , Helen said . Molly put off her visit to Florida until spring , and John , upon hearing about it , spent Christmas with Bart to preclude the possibility of Bart 's demanding that he spend the spring vacation with him . Throughout the Christmas vacation Molly was pressed into service as a nurse . She was taught how to give her grandmother sponge baths , and it was evil of her to think that the withered old body with the ribs showing through the yellowed skin and the nipples without breasts were ugly . Oh , it was proof of the evil within her that she was sickened to the point of nausea , she told herself . Margaret was her poor , kind old granny whom she should love dearly , and the old lady had never done a wicked thing , not in her whole life , and it was cruel of Molly to get to the point where the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before she opened the door . That was not a gay holiday season for Molly . The usual topic of conversation at the breakfast table was Margaret 's weight . Because of her broken bones , she could n't be placed on the scales , but she was obviously getting thinner at an alarming pace . By New Year 's Day , her head was like a skull , but sometimes she seemed to be gaining ; that was the puzzling thing . Sometimes she looked healthier , and Helen would say , " I think the poor dear has put on a few pounds , " and Bruce would agree before excusing himself to watch an early morning movie before the start of the wrestling matches . Obviously Molly could n't be spared to return to school , Poor Margaret might go at any time , her mother said . Miss Summerfield , the headmistress of the school , said Molly was so far advanced in her studies that it would n't hurt her to miss a few weeks , and the child could stay home as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret could last so long . In January the doctors were mildly  | surprised that she was still alive , and by February they were astonished . The woman certainly has an enormous will to live , one tired young physician said as he heard the clang of her dinner bell while he was walking down the stairs from her room ; she must have led a rich life . At the end of February , Margaret was still alive ; emaciated grotesquely and unable to lift the heavy bell now , but living , with her cold eyes glittering brightly . Helen thought that probably Molly should n't go back to school that year because she was needed so much at home , but to everyone 's astonishment , old Margaret drew the line there . In a faint voice she said her granddaughter should go along ; a young girl should n't be prevented from graduating from school by someone else 's sickness . On March second , Molly returned to Briarwood Manor , surprised to find herself almost loving the place , but only a week later Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a beautiful funeral , all Helen 's friends said . The casket cost four thousand dollars and was guaranteed to last forever . The undertaker fixed Margaret up so she looked so natural , all her friends said ; just like her old self . The inside of the casket was lined with cream-colored satin done up in flounces which old Bruce could n't look at because it was just like the counterpanes on the beds in an establishment he had visited every year in Buffalo when he got his Christmas bonus . Helen and Margaret had never found out about his Christmas bonus , and in good years it had lasted several nights . The combination of the satin flounces and the Christmas decorations on the streets made old Bruce extremely nervous , never mind some other details , like the rouge on poor dead Margaret 's cheeks , she , who had never worn rouge in her life . It was n't appropriate for Bruce to go to wrestling matches the week his wife died . He would have got drunk if liquor did n't upset his stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and watched the wrestling on television , his small eyes blazing with pleasure as one man jumped high in the air and landed on the belly of another . Poor Helen delayed the burial of Margaret ; she hated to see her go , she said . For three days the old lady lay in state in the undertaker 's parlor , while the family took turns standing watch over her . The purpose of this was to allow all her friends to pay their final respects , and counting the membership of the entire D.A.R. , quite  | a few came . Much of the time , however , no one was in the small room where the casket lay , and Molly found it disturbing to sit there on a straight-backed chair waiting for callers . Finally Margaret was laid to rest in the cemetery and a high marble tower representing the aspirations of humanity or something similar was placed over her . It was far taller than any of the other tombstones nearby , thus achieving for Margaret a final victory over her neighbors . Helen went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Helen had everything but their underwear dyed black . It had never really seemed possible to Helen that her mother would die , and now she was gone , abject fear came as well as relief . She looked closely at Bruce , and saw that he did n't look well . At seventy-three , there was a pallor upon him ; he was still pear-shaped , but he appeared to be gradually deflating , like a balloon with a slow leak . Soon he would die , Helen thought , and someday Molly would get married , and then she would be alone . Never in her life had Helen been alone . Her mother had had sitters for her up till the time she got married because " a young girl should not be left alone in the house . " The prospect of living alone in the big house Ken had bought for her parents terrified Helen , and the vast amount of crying she did that week was not only for her dead mother . Tearfully she made Molly promise that if she ever got married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered having Molly drop out of Briarwood instead of returning , but she had only three months to go before graduating , and no one in Helen 's block had ever graduated from such a place before . On March 15 , Molly returned to her school . She was so numbed that she found it difficult to think of spending her spring vacation with her father and with John . Two whole weeks with John would determine whether he really liked her or not , she thought , and with panic pictured herself trying to talk steadily the entire time . That would be the end of the relationship , she suspected , and soon there would not even be his letters to look forward to . Overcome by exhaustion , Molly felt almost constantly as though she were about to cry .  | 25 HELEN WAS TERRIFIED by the thought of Molly spending two weeks with Ken . For a long while Helen had been exaggerating all of Ken 's faults , real and imagined , and he came back to her in memory as an ogre , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adulterer , and although she tried not to think about it , Helen rather imagined that he and that woman he had married lay around all day doing nothing but make love . As if it were n't bad enough to send a pure young girl into an atmosphere like that , there was the appalling fact that that woman had a son who would probably be there too , under the very same roof with Molly , and heaven knew what that woman and Ken would let the young people do , or even encourage . Helen 's mind boggled at the possibilities her imagination conjured up . What she could n't understand was why the law actually permitted Molly to visit her father , even after all the facts had been examined by the court . More than that , the judge insisted that Molly be allowed to stay with her father a month a year if she wished , and Helen 's lawyer told her that if she tried to block it , Ken might stop his alimony payments . Helen felt almost as though all the policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing her to commit her innocent daughter to a brothel . As the time for the visit grew close , Helen could n't sleep . Old Bruce , her aging father , coughed a lot , and as she lay awake at night listening to him , she half hoped he would get so sick that Molly would have to come home again and be a nurse . Certainly the court could n't object to the dear girl coming home in an emergency , with her grandfather sick , dying , perhaps , of a broken heart caused by the death of his beloved wife . While waiting to go to Florida , Sylvia had a premonition that something would prevent the visit , or that if not , it would somehow turn out disastrously . She had a clear feeling that her punishment was not completed yet , that she would not be absolved of her sins until something terrible occurred . There was a temptation for her to go around apologizing to everyone in an attempt to ward off the blow . At midnight she once wrote Bart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him without loving him and that she realized  | now that many of the troubles they had had were her own fault . The next morning she tore it up , but she could n't tear the recurrent apologies from her mind . One of her nightmares was of John and Molly drowning together while in Florida . They would go off in a boat , the way they had long ago as children , only this time they would never come back . From this dream Sylvia woke up crying . It took Ken a long while to soothe her , and he was shocked when she admitted that she half hoped the children would n't come for Easter vacation , because she feared for them so . Early in March Ken and Sylvia left the small farm they had bought in Connecticut and opened their house in Florida . Driving past the old motel Ken had bought for her , Sylvia averted her eyes , and she was glad he had decided to sell it . The place was closed now , and looked somehow sinister . Remembering some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , Sylvia felt as though she had been the keeper of a bawdy house , and this increased her forebodings of disaster . Despite her premonitions , Sylvia worked hard to prepare for the coming of the children . A week before they were to arrive , Molly 's room upstairs and John 's downstairs were spotlessly clean , with new blankets and counterpanes on the beds , and new curtains at the windows . The visit should be a fresh start for everyone , Sylvia told herself , and it seemed suitable to renew everything : the rugs on the floor , the towels , the linen . Molly was expected to arrive on April 3 , with John coming four days later when his vacation started . From the twenty-fifth of March on , Sylvia worked in the kitchen , helping the cook to prepare a feast to be stored in the deep freezer . She made eight cherry pies , which had always been John 's favorite , and a dozen chocolate layer cakes , which Ken said Molly liked , and she bought ducks , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ken said smilingly , to last them all a year . Sylvia also laid in stores of Coca Cola and ginger ale before reflecting that after all , John had just turned eighteen , and Molly was seventeen : perhaps they 'd rather have beer , or stronger fare . This thought bothered her , and she asked Ken whether he thought they ought to serve the children liquor . " If they ask for it , " he said . " I do n't think I 'd volunteer it . We 'll just have to play this thing by ear . " On the day before Molly was expected , Sylvia made arrangements to have flowers delivered for almost every room in the house . She ordered calla lilies , roses and spring blossoms of all descriptions .  | When Ken smilingly said , " Whom are you planning to bury ? " she whirled on him and replied , " Do n't say that ! Please ! Knock on wood ! " During the last days of their waiting Sylvia worried a lot about whether a real reconciliation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to turn out to be just a frozen courtesy visit . In the back of Sylvia 's mind was the dread that Todd Hasper had talked to John ; no , it was more than a dread , it was a certainty , it was logical , taking into account the kind of man Hasper was . At night when she thought of this she covered her face with her hands , the gesture now becoming habitual ; she often went to sleep that way . I have to remember that even youngsters are merciful , she thought ; at least I have to pray for that . How strange that she could never even imagine talking to John about the things Hasper probably had told him . Such matters could not be talked about by a mother and son ; the understanding and the forgiveness , if there were to be any , could not spring from explanation , and after all , Sylvia thought , even if she could discuss such matters , what was there to be said ? She worried about Ken 's meeting Molly almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big man was like a child looking forward to Christmas , she thought ; he seemed to assume his daughter would come running immediately to his arms , that their separation had been merely geographical . " You do n't want to get your hopes up , " she said to him . " You might be in for a disappointment . " " Why do you say that ? " " I do n't know , I have a feeling . . . " Her heart jumped when the telephone rang at eleven o'clock on the evening of March 30 , and before she picked up the receiver she knew something had gone wrong , that the visit was imperiled . She was not surprised when the operator said there was a long-distance call from Buffalo for Mr. Kenneth Jorgenson , but the look on his face when he picked up the receiver was odd . " Hello ? " Ken said , " Who is it ? " That was the first time Sylvia had ever heard that deep voice sound frightened . " It 's me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own daring , her own sudden midnight decision . " Helen ! What 's the matter ? " " It 's Dad ! Poor Dad . "  | " Is he dead ? " " No , but he 's so sick , and I 'm afraid Molly wo n't be able to go South . We need her here . " " Now look ! " Ken said , his deep voice suddenly rumbling louder , sounding as though it could easily carry to Buffalo without the aid of a telephone . " Do n't try to pull that ! " " Why , I do n't know what you mean ! He 's got bronchitis , and a terrible cough , and the doctor said , a man his age ... " " Get a nurse . " " Why , he might die when she was away , and she 'd never forgive herself . " There was a pause while Ken clenched and unclenched his free hand . " What 's his temperature ? " he said suddenly . " The truth now , because I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the temperature , it 's his poor lungs , at his age . . . " " Helen , you listen here ! You stop this foolishness and let Molly come down here , or I 'll cause you more trouble than you 've ever dreamed of . You wo n't get another cent out of me until this thing is straightened out . I 'll get every lawyer in New York on your tail . " " It 's an emergency . . . " Helen said weakly . " You better have a doctor 's sworn testimony to prove it ! " " Molly could come some other time ... " " I want her here now . " " She does n't really want to come . I ca n't force the child . " " Is she there ? " " No . She 's at school . I just talked to her . " " I 'll call her myself in the morning . " Ken slept hardly at all that night . At ten the next morning he telephoned Briarwood Manor . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello ? " Molly said suddenly , her voice sounding timid and far away . " Molly , baby , I 'm going to be terribly disappointed if you ca n't get down here for your vacation , " Ken said , and the note of pleading in his voice shocked Sylvia . If Molly does n't come , I bet John wo n't , she thought  --  he 's really coming to see her , not us . There would be no visit after all , Sylvia thought as she listened to Ken 's sad voice , and she was caught in a collision of disappointment and relief . " Do you want to come ? " Ken kept saying to Molly . " Do you want  | to ? " There was a silence before he said , " Do n't cry ! Do n't cry ! Oh , please come down here ! We need each other ! " There was a pause before he put the receiver down . His face was glistening with sweat when he said , " She is coming . " Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would be better , far better , if everything were postponed . You should n't have begged her , she wanted to say , but that would have hurt him too much . The rest of the day Sylvia hoped for the telephone to ring again , but it did n't . Molly 's plane was due at five the next afternoon . Carla had not seemed overjoyed at the prospect of " a new big sister " arriving and went off to spend the day with friends . Ken insisted on leaving the house at four , although it was only a ten-minute drive to the airport . Sometimes the planes got in early , he said , especially with a tail wind , and anybody could see that the wind was blowing hard from the north . In the waiting room , he paced back and forth restlessly , dressed in his best linen suit , with his handkerchief neatly folded in his breast pocket , and a new necktie of the pale blue Molly liked . Sylvia sat with her hands folded in her lap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane was announced , she had to run to keep up with Ken as he strode to the gate . Behind a rope barrier he stood in the midst of a knot of people , watching intently as the door of the plane was opened . The stairway on wheels was rolled up , and out stepped a girl , but it was the stewardess . Next there was a fat man with a briefcase , and a woman holding a child . A seemingly endless procession of people came out ; one would never have thought the plane could hold so many . Last of all came Molly . " There she is ! " Ken shouted , a deep bellow that carried all the way to the plane , and bursting from the knot of people , he vaulted the rope barrier , and ran toward her . She stood on the platform high up , by the plane door , a slender girl in a blue coat with the wind whipping the skirts about her legs , holding her hat on her head with one hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came bounding up the steps , and crushed her in his arms . Oh no , he should n't have done that , Sylvia thought ; these things have to go slow and easy , but it was too late to say that . Ken came toward her , so wrapped up in his own joy at seeing his daughter that he did n't notice the strained look on Molly 's face , the frightened , puzzled  | eyes . " Here she is ! " he said jubilantly to Sylvia , " Has n't she grown up to be beautiful ? " " Hello , dear , " Sylvia said in a low voice , and held out her hand , because she was suddenly afraid Molly would flinch if she kissed her . My God , maybe she knows all about me too , Sylvia thought with horror , and was about to let her hand drop when Molly clasped it shyly , and said , " Hello . . . " Molly stopped suddenly , because she had almost added " Mrs. Hunter , " and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " Mother , " and " Sylvia " sounded wrong too , as though she were trying to get chummy with her or something . The three of them walked to the car , and Ken drove them home , talking enthusiastically about all the wonderful things they were going to do , now they were all getting together again . " John is coming Thursday , " Ken said , his voice a little roguish . " That 's nice , " Molly replied , attempting a casual tone of politeness , but sounding completely uninterested instead . Ken glanced at her sharply , and for the first time noticed how pale she was , how tense . " Are you feeling all right , honey ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said . When they went into the living room , Molly stood in front of a mirror by a vase of calla lilies and slowly took off her hat . " If you 'll excuse me , I think I 'd like to take a little rest before dinner , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little rough . " " Of course ! " Ken and Sylvia said in unison . After she had gone upstairs , Ken strode restlessly back and forth in the living room . " It 's perfectly natural for her to be shy at first , " he said . " Let 's have a cocktail , Sylvia  --  I feel Iike one tonight . " Sylvia stirred up some Martinis . When Molly came down she glanced at the pitcher on the table and said , " Do you mind if I have one ? " " Sure , " Ken said . He got up and poured it . As Molly took the glass he noticed that there was a barely perceptible nervous tremor in her hand . " It 's good to have you home again ! " he said too heartily . " You do n't know how I 've been looking forward to this ! " Molly took a sip of the Martini and put the glass down . " Thank you , " she replied , obviously trying her best to respond . Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also want to thank you for the beautiful flowers in my room . " " That 's all right , dear , " Sylvia replied , and reaching for the  | pitcher of Martinis , was shocked at a sudden urge she felt to get drunk . Without pouring herself a drink , she put the pitcher down . " I think it 's about time for dinner to be served , " she said . At breakfast on the morning of the day John was to arrive , Molly said she was going to take a long walk on the beach , looking for shells down by the inlet . She asked Ken not to wait for her if she was n't back in time to go to the airport . " Try to make it , " Ken said , sounding puzzled . " I think poor John would be hurt if you were n't there . You used to be such good friends . " " I 'll try , " Molly said , but there was that in her tone which forbade urging , a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had finished her coffee , she changed into her bathing suit , and putting on a beach coat to protect herself from the sun , she set out , walking slowly , with her head bent down , but not looking for shells . It was necessary to forget the pages of poetry she had sent him , she told herself . Probably he had forgotten it himself , and anyway , it was n't really important whether he liked her or not ; she could survive . It was silly to depend so much on his letters anyway . Houses had been built all along the row of dunes since Molly had been in Florida , but she was too preoccupied to see them . Children ran past her throwing sand . A hairy man in swimming trunks whistled at her as she walked by , but she did n't hear him . Instinctively her feet took her north , where there was privacy , for when the hurricanes came bursting through there in the fall , the seas raged high on the beach on both sides of the inlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter mile away . Climbing to the crest of the dunes nearest the inlet , she sat with a piece of salty grass between her lips , and stared out to sea . An hour before John 's plane was due , Sylvia changed into her best white dress and combed her hair . Glancing into the mirror , she saw that insomnia and the strain of the past few days had made her appear haggard . Well , she thought grimly , if Hasper has talked to him , I look the part . One little drink before going to the airport would n't hurt , she thought , and took two . The important thing is not to have a lot of preconceptions of what he will be like now , she thought . He is older , he will be going to  | 26 " JOHNNY 'S GOT A GIRL FRIEND ! " Carla , who was then twelve years old ; said four days later . " Yes , " John said . " I have . " He was in his bathing trunks now with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splotch which embarrassed him unbearably . " I can see why you 're on the boxing team , " Ken said . " You 've got quite a set of shoulders there . " " Actually , I do n't like boxing very much , " John replied . He left them as soon as he could and ran swiftly to the beach , where Molly was awaiting him . It embarrassed them less to leave the house individually , and to meet in private . Wearing her blue bathing suit , she was sitting just above the reach of the tide . " Hello ! " he called exuberantly as he ran . " Sorry I 'm late ! " He was all of three minutes late . She stood up , smiling , with the wind blowing her hair across her face . " I have n't been waiting long , " she said . They started walking down the beach together , their hands automatically locking , the wind at their backs . Near the inlet at the end of the beach they paused . Three shrimp boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar and the rush of the incoming tide . A flock of gulls hovered like a great wheel turning over them . Farther up the inlet was a hollow created in the sand by the surf  | during the last hurricane . Semi-surrounded by high banks which were covered with tall grass and stunted palmetto trees , it offered at least a measure of privacy . John wanted to take Molly there , but the fear mounted in him that she would refuse , that in all probability she was willing to hold his hand simply as an act of friendship , far different in its implications from accompanying him to a lonely spot . If he did ask her to go there with him , he thought , or if he simply headed in that direction , she might refuse , saying , perhaps , " Why do you want to go there , Johnny ? " She might even feel indignant , shocked , angry , disgusted , jerking her hand from his forever because he had misinterpreted a comradely gesture , and then , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologies , and the sky would fall , all dreams would shatter and come crashing down like broken glass around his feet . Torn by his desire to be alone with her , away from the eyes of the swimmers and , picnickers and gatherers of shells , and by the fear of ruining what was already a kind of perfection , he stood tongue-tied . Then , with the feeling that he was taking an immense gamble , risking everything on one sentence , he said , " Let 's go in there where we can sit sheltered from the wind . " " All right , " she said . They walked into an amphitheater of broken dunes . Beneath their feet the sand , shading from tan to gray to white , was still stippled by the action of the waves . When they found themselves shielded from passers-by , they sat down awkwardly , with their backs against the steep slope of the dune , their legs stretched straight out in front of them , their hands still clasped , their faces tense , almost agonized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull her toward him ; he wanted to touch her shoulder , but again the fear rose within him , redoubled . Maybe , indeed probably , she had come there with him just to get out of the wind . " Johnny ! " she might say if he touched her , " Johnny Hunter , you stop that ! Why , the ideal Johnny , you should be ashamed of yourself ! " She might slap him , she might go screaming down the beach calling for help , she might tell her father , the police ; and worst of all , he might find that he inspired in her only disgust , that she did n't love him , that no woman could ever love him at all . If he tried to kiss her she might recoil in horror , as though touched by the snout of a pig , and then he would know , as he had always suspected , that there was something repugnant about him , and that he was condemned to loneliness . He would have to walk back  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon him for someone else ; that she had been kind , but that no one could in the last analysis be kind enough to overlook the fact that he was too repellent to be loved . After sitting frozen by these thoughts for a minute , John moved toward her a little , cautiously enough to make it look like an accident if she recoiled , ready to pull back and say with elaborate casualness , " Sorry ! " His muscles were so tight that his arms ached . She let go of his hand suddenly , perhaps in alarm . He put his arm back in a tortuous , cramped position , not touching her , but then she leaned toward him , and he let his arm down on her shoulders . Thus the incredible came to pass , he played Russian roulette and won , or at least she allowed him to place his arm around her shoulders , and did not scream or run . They sat in a very cramped position , their bodies rigid , he leaning forward with his arm around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was afraid to speak , afraid to move a quarter of an inch for fear she would pull away from him . A strand of her hair blew across his lips ; he bent his head down ; the fragrance of her hair and skin seemed to grow more and more intense until he took her by both shoulders and turned her to him , thinking now she will run , now I have betrayed myself , but I can not help it , and he kissed her on the lips , finding them soft , inquiring , maybe responding , maybe not . Terrified that she would pull away , he kissed her again , and he was not sure of her consent until he felt her place her hand on the back of his head , caressing him softly . Then a shudder went through him , and feeling that the greatest of all imaginable crises had passed , he looked up and found her smiling at him . In slow motion he reached out his hand and touched her gently on the cheek , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " they both said . He stretched out on the sand beside her . " You are , " he said , saying something he had been aching to say for the past four years , something he had been afraid to say , " you are more beautiful than I can believe . " " I 'm glad , " she said . " It 's nice to know you like the way I look . " There was a pause , and then she added , " Johnny , you are n't fooling me , are you ? " " I love you so much you make me tremble , " he said . He held his hand out to her , and it was true , at that moment he was trembling ,  | as though just rescued from the face of a cliff . She caught his hand and held it tightly against her cheek . " I was scared to death you did n't really like me , " she said . " Me too . I was afraid that if I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he kissed her again , burying his face in her neck , tasting the saltness of her skin . Then the laughter stopped , and there was the incredible softness and warmth , beauty beyond old dreams , so long forbidden . " No , Johnny , " she finally said , pulling away from him . " Are you angry ? " he asked in panic . " No , but I am afraid . " " I want to marry you , " he said . " We ca n't , Not for years . " " We could run away together , " he said . " It would be silly , Johnny . You 've got to go to college , and the army , and all the rest . " " That will be six or seven years ! " he said in horror . " We can still see each other . Often . " " But we have to go back to school in a week , " he said , astonished to find that this prospect remained even on these days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer ? " she asked . " Pine Island . Could you visit us there ? " " I 'm afraid Mother is going to keep me in Buffalo again , " she said miserably . " Maybe we could get together in the fall , " he said . " I start at Harvard in September and girls often come for weekends . " " Mother would never let me . " The thought of the lonesome months ahead sobered them . They kissed more deeply than before , and he found it difficult to stop . " I do n't want to scare you , " he groaned . " I 'll take you home now if you want . " She said nothing . " Oh , Molly ! " he said , and she did not pull away from his kiss . For Molly there was fear , counterbalanced by the knowledge that the word " no " struck him like a stone in the face . There was the vision of his stalking away as so many boys had after dancing with her , his need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kisses . . . . There was the moment of panic , the pain , in which a thousand hideous voices seemed to scream . There were the fears  | upon fears mounting and echoing against each other ; there was the feeling of being imprisoned , of being unable to escape ; there was the vision of her father crying . She seemed to be in a circle of mocking faces chanting shame ! The thin , horrified scream of her mother ululated constantly in the back of her mind . There was the vision of her dead grandmother shaking a finger at her , telling her that monstrous things would happen if this were not forbidden . There was the incongruous stink of sweat , the sharp hot breaths , the animal sounds , the sudden image of a lamb being eaten by a lion ? terror . At one time she tried to pull away from him , but he held her in a grip of iron . And then the bad part was over , and she found herself not with a beast of prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dumb with adoration , he was suddenly as gentle as a father with a child , and she knew finally that he belonged to her , that she had paid a great price , but that he was hers , and that she could not deny him when he begged forgiveness . There was also joy . Since childhood she had thought of her body as something that had to be hidden , not only because of the unimaginable things , the wickedness , the sin , but also because she thought clothes were a necessary deception to hide some mysterious , fundamental ugliness of flesh . But on that day Molly found that in the eyes of one person at least she was , astonishingly enough , perfect ; that she had nothing to hide ; and that she could cause delight . It was an incredible luxury to stretch proudly there on the sand before him , bearing him gifts in the sun . There was the absence of all defenses , the easy communication between them , the fringe benefits of love . Afterward there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever talked to anyone , really , which is to say , the first time they had ever talked about anything which mattered . He told Molly all about Bill Norris , about how it had been to wake up at night and see that empty cot , perfectly made up , in that lonely room . He went on , the words rushing out in an orgy of truth , telling how the boys had jerked the covers off Bill , how Bill had lived for two years in the midst of cruelty and jeers , how the headmaster had covered up , how even he himself had ended by finding it impossible to tell Bill 's mother what had happened to her son . He told her also about the lonely summer he had spent at camp . She in turn told him in detail about her troubles at school , about why she had had to stop meeting  | him in New York , and about Margaret 's death . The fact that it is occasionally possible to talk about things next to the heart was an extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in a desert world bereft of people , and for the first time met a human being ; it was as though they had been deaf and dumb from birth and just found the power of speech ; it was astonishing , this discovery that conversation can go beyond ordinary communication , that language when combined with love can conquer the separateness of people . He remembered the letters they had written each other , the funny mincing phrases , the sense that there was nothing to write about , except in poems or songs , and he said , " Why have n't we ever been able to talk before ? " " Because we were afraid , " she said , stretching like a cat in the sun , fragile and delicate . After about an hour they got dressed and started toward the house , walking slowly along the beach , pausing often , John still talking rapidly , gesticulating with his arms , laughing , picking her up in a torrent of words , explaining his whole life . She listened gravely . He told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's departure and the night , and was understood . As they approached their house John did not feel oppressed by the necessity to keep a secret . There was not the slightest temptation to tell anyone , neither to boast nor to confess . He walked into the living room of his mother 's home without seeing the people around him . When Molly went upstairs to her room , Sylvia started asking John questions about his school , and more to avoid an irritating interruption of his thoughts than anything else , he sat down at the piano and played his mother every song he knew , saving only the one he had written himself . Sylvia was astonished to find he could play so well . But for Molly it was different . When she left John and started climbing the stairs to her room , she experienced a sudden dizziness so strong that she almost fell . At the head of the stairs Ken , who had heard her footsteps , emerged from his bedroom smiling , and said , " Hi , baby . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , her voice tight , tears almost coming , and hurried to her room as fast as she could without running . Totally confused , Ken stood mutely looking after her , wondering what he had done wrong . That night Molly sat across from John at the middle of a long  | table with her father at one end and Sylvia at the other while an aged Negress served a festive dinner . Molly had a terrifying compulsion then to speak out , to tell the truth . " Dad , " she would say , and her father would glance up , his big alert face looking tired , as it had lately . " Dad , " she would say , " Johnny took me out in the dunes today , and I think I may be going to have a baby . " She imagined her father turning on John then in a rage . The waitress took away a dish of pea soup , one of the favorite dishes which Molly had barely touched , and replaced it with a platter of rare roast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She glanced away from it , and she had another vision then , a horrifying one , of herself saying , " Dad , do you know what I did today ? " and following that question with every obscenity she had ever seen chalked on lavatory walls , the short hideous words spewing from her mouth like vomit . Then her father would arise and smite her , perhaps kill her , she imagined . " Molly , are n't you hungry ? " Sylvia asked . " Oh yes , I 'm going to eat , " Molly replied . Eating was extremely difficult , but she felt it necessary to give the impression that she was feeling perfectly well . John was looking at her worriedly , and she smiled timorously at him . After dinner she went to her room , saying she wanted to read . Her head throbbed ; there was a feeling that the top of it was going to blow off . Holding both hands pressed to her ears , she threw herself down on her bed . That night she had dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her flail her arms , knocking over a lamp on the bedside table , causing her father to rush in crying , " What 's the matter ? " With scared eyes she blinked at the big man in the blue bathrobe at the foot of her bed . " I guess I must have had a nightmare , " she said . In the morning Molly arose with a profound sense of disaster . After forcing down her breakfast , she put on her bathing suit , went to the beach and sat huddled on the sand , a forlorn and dejected figure in the bright morning sun . John soon appeared in swimming trunks , buoyant and selfconfident , and threw himself down beside her in the sand , a young athlete astride the world . He took her hand and touched her wrist , a gesture of infinite tenderness , and he said , " I hope you 're feeling better . "  | " We ca n't hold hands here , " she said . " Someone might see . " " Is there a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good taste ! " " All right , " he said , and let her hand go . An old man in short trousers who was walking without shoes at the water 's edge looked at them curiously . " Let 's get out of here , Johnny , " Molly said . " Let 's take a walk . " Striding along the beach , John asked her about her school , and she described it , finding him easy to talk to , but oddly enough , their new ease of communication did not include her fear , her terror , her guilt ? that was a dark island within her , unapproachable even to him . Two old women with big straw hats were casting from the beach into the inlet . Wearing faded cotton dresses almost to their ankles , they shouted gaily to each other , and ran up and down the beach whooping with glee like children whenever one of them caught a fish . To escape their curious stares Molly led the way to the secret place in the dunes , and almost immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ! " she said desperately . He stopped immediately , taken aback . " Why ? " " Because I 'm still afraid . " That , the understatement of the year . " Of having a baby ? " " Yes . That and other things I ca n't explain . " " If you did find out you were going to have one , we could get married right away . " " No ! " she said . " Would n't you like to get married ? " " No . Not now . Not that way . " " I know you 're right , and that we should be sensible and wait and all that , " John said in a monotone . " Yes , " she said with great earnestness . " We 've got to be good . " " I do n't know what it means to be good , " he said miserably . " Are you bad , Johnny ? " she asked , shocked . " Do you do this with other girls ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the word means , the word good : Will it be good ' to see each other hardly at all for the next four or five years ? Is loneliness good ' ? " " That 's not what I mean , " she said . " I think your shoulders are good , " he said . " I give these tendons in your foot a mark of excellent . "  | " No , Johnny ! Please ! " " Ca n't I even hold your hand ? " " Of course , but you do n't stop . " " I just want to hold your hand , " he said . The wind rustled the grass on the dunes , making the palmetto leaves whisper , and she started suddenly , believing someone was there . It would be bad to be seen in such a secluded spot , she thought , even if they were only holding hands . Behind the sandbanks anyone might be lurking  --  small boys , vagrants , bird watchers , Peeping Toms , her father taking a morning walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky , seemed full of scowling faces with eyes . She sat rigid with fear , and she said , " Johnny , we should n't be seen here . Let 's take a walk . " " All right , " he said . " If that 's what you want . " " How about a swim ? " " I hate swimming , " he said . " The water looks cold . " " I 'm asking you to go swimming with me . Then you 're coming home with me and you 're going to chat with Dad and your mother . It 's important that we be very normal . " " Sure , " he said . " How would you like to rent some bicycles ? I have n't ridden a bike in ages . " " That would be fun , " he said , brightening . " Let 's go , " she said . " I 'll race you into the water . " In a blur of motion she was off in front of him , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water 's edge he caught up with her , and they plunged into the sea together , emerging from the first comber breathless , but shouting like Indians in battle . 27 Timovcxour THE VACATION the atmosphere in Ken 's house became more and more tense . Molly 's shyness and reserve increased . She did n't seem capable of sitting and talking with either Sylvia or Ken ,  | and when they addressed her , she had a habit of averting her eyes . Sylvia became convinced that Molly must have heard such terrible things about Ken and herself that it was torture for the poor child to be polite , as she was obviously trying to be . John played the piano almost every minute he was n't off somewhere with Molly , and on the few occasions Sylvia tried to engage him in conversation , he was courteous but evasive . There was a troubled look in his eyes , and in the music he played there was a wild mixture of elation and despair . Molly was obviously the cause of the elation , Sylvia thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother . Her only consolation was that some day both Molly and John would grow old enough to forgive . All children go through a stage of despising their parents , she told herself grimly ; divorce just makes matters a little worse . On the last afternoon of Molly 's vacation John and she sat on the beach in the place the hurricane had made crashing through the dunes , but it was not secret enough . " Anyone could come along , " Molly said . No place to go . " Molly , " he said suddenly , " the place where I used to live , the old motel  --  it 's closed , locked up and for sale . " " Oh , no , Johnny ! " she said . " Not an empty house . The very thought gives me the creeps . " " No one could find us there . " " No , " she said . " I know that place . There 's a loose window in the cellar . I could get in . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep worrying about people seeing us , " he said . " I thought ... " " Please , Johnny , for the last time , I beg you . No . " " All right , " he said . " I do n't want to scare you . I keep telling myself that " He put his hand out and touched her ankle with such infinite longing that she was moved . " Poor Johnny , " she said . " I know I 'm wrong about this , " he said . " Anybody would say so . " " Do n't worry . " He stroked her foot . " Did you ever look at a foot ? " " Yes , " she said , laughing . " I mean , really look at it . " " Sure . " " It 's very beautiful . The way it 's made . This arch , like a steel  | spring . The marvelous things like steel cords just under the skin . It 's a miracle . " " There are lots of miracles around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here . " " Yes , " he said . " I would like to understand more about miracles . " " Want to be a doctor ? " " No . I would hate to take a foot apart . " He encircled her ankle with his fingers . " I like it as it is . " " Kiss me , Johnny . " " No . I would only end by making myself even more miserable , or scaring you . It 's no good because it 's one-sided . I 've just realized that . " " It 's not one-sided ! " she said , shocked . " This part is . " " Johnny , it 's not that I do n't love you ! It 's just that I 'm so terribly scared ! " " I know . " He stretched out on his back on the sand , deeply tanned now , and lithe , but curiously in the attitude of a corpse . His eyes were closed against the sun , and his chest seemed hardly to move for breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking down at him . " I love you , Johnny , " she said . He smiled without opening his eyes . " That will be good to think about . " " It 's true . " " I know it is . I love you back . " She sat staring down at him , feeling oddly as though she had killed him , the tableau complete , the murderess sitting by her victim 's side . He seemed utterly relaxed , his face serene , the voice friendly , no forced melancholy , but indefinably dead . " We 'll write often , Johnny , " she said . " Every day . " " And sometimes twice . " " I 'm sorry Mother wo n't let me visit you . Maybe I can make her change her mind . " " Maybe . " " Next summer maybe I can talk her into letting me go to Pine Island . " " That would be wonderful . " " Mother might change her mind about your visiting me at school , and you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , facing her , and said , " We 've got to face facts , Molly . Your mother is going to make it just as tough on us as she possibly can . She wants to break us up , and maybe she 'll succeed , at least for a long while . " " We can stick it out , " Molly said . " I 've been lying here trying to imagine what it 's going to be like . With no fooling , Molly . Sunday when I start back to school . My old room . It 's a thing I 'm trying to get used to . " " Me too . I do n't look forward to it , either . " " I know , " he said . " We play volley ball every day at three . I hate volley ball . " He laughed . " We also play field hockey , " she said . " There is an enormous girl who keeps rushing down on me . I just get out of her way , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute her , " he said . " I want no broken bones . " " We have to carry books on our head to learn to stand straight , " she said . " There 's a teacher there by the name of Miss Wriggly . Honest . And she wriggles when she walks , in a kind of horrible way . " Molly got to her feet , turning , to John 's astonishment , into an expert mimic . " Miss Wriggly says , Now , girls , you must realize how important it is to know how to enter a room . You should pause at the door , and you should imagine that all eyes are upon you . It does n't make a bit of difference whether it 's true . You should feel it . You should carry yourself like a queen . ' Then , " Molly concluded , " she comes wriggling in . Like this . " She gave a convincing demonstration of a stilted , mincing gait . " Do queens walk like that ? " John asked , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Miss Wriggly has , either . " " I love the way you walk , " John said . " Do n't let Miss Wriggly change it . " " She would n't like to hear you say that , " Molly said . " She says , Molly Carter , what am I going to do ? You wo n't learn how to enter a room and you wo n't learn how to sit : " " To sit ? " John asked in astonishment . " Yes . We 're supposed to sit like this . " Folding her hands neatly in front of her , Molly sank in a highly circumspect manner to the sand . " I love the way you sit , " John said . " Do n't let her change it . "  | " School 's not going to be so bad after this , Johnny , " she said softly . " Nothing 's going to be so bad . You 've done me good . " " Come on , " he said briskly , sitting up . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hotel tonight . Want to go ? " " Johnny , " she said , catching him by the hand . " Kiss me once . " " No ! " he said brusquely . " There 's no point in making this any tougher . " " Is a kiss tough ? " " Oh , Molly . Stopping after one is . I 'm trying my best to do what you want . " " Right now , I want a kiss . " He gave her one . When it was over she said , " I 'll go with you tonight . Wherever you want . " " Do n't offer that , " he said bluntly . " I do n't have the strength to refuse . " " I would n't offer if I wanted you to refuse . " " Oh , Molly ! " he said , pulling her to him and burying his face in her hair . " I do n't want to do awful things to you . " " They 're not awful things . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love you , Johnny , " she said . " Do n't ever forget that . " " I 'm going to ask you to go into the motel first and make sure everything 's all right , " Molly said very reasonably while they were walking back along the beach . " I 'll tell Dad we 're going to the movies . That will give us plenty of time . " " All right , " John said . " Down at the Bijou they 're showing King Kong again . I saw that ages ago at school , so if they ask me questions about it , I 'll know the answers . " " Good , " John said . " Molly , if you do n't want to do this , for God 's sake , do n't . " " Hush . Have you seen King Kong ? " " No . " " Well , you better know about it in case they ask you how you liked the movie . It 's a real old one they keep reviving . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prehistoric age . He carries this girl , Fay Wray , I think it is , off in the palm of his hand . " " Oh , Molly , " he said . " I 'm beginning to feel awful . " " Why ? "  | " I 'm making you do something you do n't want to do . " " I never do things I do n't want to do , " she said . " Ask Miss Wriggly . " " You 're sure about this ? All these plans make it so sort of coldblooded . " " We have to be practical , " she said . " Now listen about King Kong , because Dad might get suspicious , and he might ask you questions , and Johnny . . . " " Yes ? " " Johnny , " she said with dreadful earnestness . " I do n't want to be caught . You said there was a way not to have a baby . " " Yes . " " Can you do that ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why does it have to be so horrible ? " " I do n't know , " he said in real confusion . " The horrible part  --  I do n't know . " " Is it worth it , Johnny ? " " No . " The word sounded false . " It 's not worth it to you , " he added . " It is to me if it is to you . " " No , Molly , " he said . " The hell with it . I 'll take you to that dance and tomorrow I 'll get on the train , and that will be that . We 'll write letters . " " It 's worth it to you , " she said conclusively . " Yes , " he said . " I ca n't lie about it . I do n't know why , but yes . I do n't care much about consequences . I know that sounds horrible . Maybe I 'm horrible . I do n't know . " " All right , Johnny , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's that important to me . " They continued walking down the beach . " About King Kong , " she said . " In case anybody asks you . In the end , this big gorilla , or whatever it is , climbs the Empire State Building , and these airplanes come and kill him . He bats at them like flies , but they kill him . It 's kind of sad . " " Sounds terrible , " John said . " If anybody asks you , just talk about the end , " Molly said . " That 's the part that everybody remembers . " He left her at the house , got a flashlight , and went to reconnoiter the old motel . By that time it was almost dark . The cellar window of the motel was as loose as he remembered it . He opened it easily , and lowered himself into a small storage room .  | Pitch blackness . He turned on the flashlight . The room was piled high with terrace furniture covered with dust . He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashlight so that it could not be seen from outside , the beam making his fingers glow red and satanic in the dark . The old familiar kitchen , the hall . The little lobby was ghostly with sheet-shrouded furniture , and there was the smell of mothballs . Then he came to the curved staircase with the cool wrought-iron railing he had run his hand along so many times before . He hurried up it and went to his old room . There it was , with the bed on which he had cried so often . Two chairs were piled on top of it , a box of books , and a desk . The whole pyramid was covered by sheets . He took the sheets off , put the furniture in the old places , and dusted the room with one of the sheets . In the bottom drawer of the bureau he found a silk-covered comforter packed with moth flakes . He shook it out and covered the mattress on the bed . On the way out he glanced at his mother 's old room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar hall , and opened it . In the corner was the empty armchair where his mother had often sat . Now it was covered by a sheet . Dead silence . Still keeping his hand over the light to allow only a faint glow , he walked back to his own room . The smell of moth flakes was overpowering . The catch on the window opened easily , and he slid up the sash . Fresh air . Outside , the surf pounded with the old familiar roar , and a half moon was just climbing out of the sea . The wind bent the faded muslin curtains into the shape of wings . He went downstairs to a side door , which was bolted from the inside , as it always had been , and went out , leaving it so it could be opened from the outside . He walked six blocks to the drugstore . A tall old man with bushy eyebrows stood behind the counter . Steeling himself , John whispered to him . " Young man , " the druggist said quite loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no one else in the store . " Twentyone , " he said in a low voice . " Young man , I doubt it . I have four children of my own and eight grandchildren . I see no reason why the fact that I 'm a pharmacist should place me under an obligation to contribute to the . . . John walked out . He was trembling . Looking at his watch , he saw it was almost eight , when he had said he would meet Molly . The wizened colored maid let him in the front door . Ken was  | sitting in the living room reading a newspaper . " Hello , " he said , smiling and looking up . " I suppose you want Molly . " " Yes , " John said . " We 're going to the movies . King Kong . " " She 's upstairs , " Ken said . " She 'll be down in a minute . " John got a copy of the Saturday Evening Post with a picture of a little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy chair and started to read a story about a cowboy and a pretty schoolteacher . Then there was a footstep . He looked up . Molly was standing before him in a dress that was yellow , almost the color of gold , quite formal . She had put a white magnolia blossom in her hair . " Come on , Johnny , " she said . " Let 's go . " " Kind of dressed up for the movies , are n't you ? " Ken asked . " We might stop in at the dance afterward , " Molly said . They walked out the front door and down the driveway . " We ca n't go , " John said . " The druggist would n't sell me one . Maybe I can get a taxi and try somewhere else . " His voice sounded tortured . " Poor Johnny , " she said . " It must have been horrible . " " It was . " " We 'll just have to be careful , " she said . " No . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to ? " " No ! " " Is the motel all right ? " " Yes ! Why does this have to be so terrible ? " " It does n't , " she said . The side door opened at his touch , and they climbed the dusty stairs silently together , his hand glowing over the flashlight beam . When he opened the door to his room , he saw that moonlight was streaming through the window , and he put the flashlight out . The wind from the sea was fresh . She stood in the center of the room with the moonlight glinting on her golden dress . " Oh , Molly , " he said . " I 'll never forget ... "  | 28 ALL TEAT EVENING Ken was restless . At eleven-thirty he gave up trying to read and went to his bedroom , where Sylvia had already retired . No light was on when he opened the door , but he knew she was awake and having an asthma attack . The rasping of her breath was torturous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . As his eyes got used to the darkness , he saw that she was sitting up in bed . " I 'm afraid so , " she replied wryly . " Have you used the nebulizer ? " " Not yet . The darn stuff keeps me awake . " He undressed , slipped on his pajamas and got into bed . Sleep did not come . It seemed like a long while before she said , " Ken , what time is it ? " Snapping on the light on the bedside table , he glanced at his wrist watch and said , " Quarter after twelve . " 11 " Should n't the children be home from the movies by now ? " " They said they might go on to the dance at the hotel afterward . " " Oh . " There was a sound of a match striking and a sudden glare as Sylvia lit a cigarette . " I wish you would n't smoke in bed , " he said . " I 'll be careful . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You should n't do it . " " I said I 'd be careful ! " Her voice was sharp . " I 'm sorry . " He closed his eyes and tried to concentrate on mathematical problems , a procedure which had always worked better for him than counting sheep . Through the open window came the distant music of a radio turned too loud , and the growl of a truck 's 11 gears on the state highway . It seemed to Ken that hours passed . It was hot . " Ken , " Sylvia whispered . " Are you still awake ? " " Yes . " " What time is it ? " He put the light on again . " Almost one o'clock . " " When is the dance over ? " " One , I think . "  | " They ought to be home pretty soon . " " Now do n't lie there worrying about them ! " he said impatiently . " I ca n't help it . " " There 's nothing to worry about ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly in love . Surely you ca n't miss seeing that . " " Of course . " " It is n't easy at that age . They 're both so intense ! " " That 's natural , is n't it ? " " Yes , but I 've been lying here thinking that we should talk to them . Do you think we should ? " " What about ? " He kept his voice deliberately noncommittal . " I do n't know . It seems as though we ought to be able to help them . We went through so nearly the same thing ourselves . " " Do n't make the mistake of ascribing our experiences to them . They 're different people . " " I know , but ... " " What do you think we should say to them ? " " I do n't know . That they should take it a little easy , I guess . " " Do you think that would help ? " " Poor Johnny 's been hurt so much ! I do n't want anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for heaven 's sake ! " " Not on purpose . But sometimes I wonder if she knows what she 's doing . A girl that age . . . Beauty is such a terrible power . " " Molly is n't like that ! " " Oh , I know , " Sylvia said in confusion . " But they 're both so young ! " " They 're going to be all right , " Ken replied . " What time is it ? " " Quarter after one . " " They ought to be home pretty soon . " But at two Molly and John were not home , and they were still out at three . " Darn it , I will have a talk with that boy , " Ken said angrily . " He 's got to learn to be more responsible ! " " Do n't put all the blame on him . I imagine Molly has something to do with it . " " I 'll have a talk with her too , " Ken said grimly . Lying in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door closing or of footsteps on the stairs , Ken was shocked at the series of thoughts to  | which his worried imagination was subjecting him . There was , grotesque in its ugliness , the image of John making love to Molly , of his hand on her breast , of . . . That is ridiculous , Ken told himself . The old are always attributing their own guilty memories to the young . They are innocent , both of them ; they are little more than children ; there is something especially hideous in the concept of the worried father conjuring up such fantasies about his daughter . But damn it , he thought , there 's something that I do n't trust about that boy  --  that unnatural courtesy ; he is a Hunter after all ; he 's more Bart than Sylvia , he 's Bart all over again . Ken remembered with strange acuteness then the sensation of seeing Bart kiss Sylvia in the old days , his own helpless longing , the mute jealousy ... . Jealousy , he thought , turning over violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous all over again , and that 's really ugly , the father jealous of his daughter 's suitor . Johnny 's not really like Bart ; I suppose I would n't like any boy with Molly . It 's not fair to damn Johnny because of his father . Nevertheless , Ken found his fists doubling up at the very thought of the name " Hunter . " The way the boy looked at Molly , the quick response in her eyes , the manner in which she got up immediately and followed when John left the room , without any conversation being necessary , the hours during which the two of them disappeared together , walking down the beach  --  suddenly these fresh memories seemed sinister to Ken and infuriating . I will not let him take advantage of her , he thought ; I shall have a talk with her ; I shall warn her . It is the duty of a father to teach his daughter the ways of the world . At half past four in the morning , while these thoughts were still revolving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly and footsteps on the stairs . He got out of bed . " Ken ! " Sylvia said . " Where are you going ? " " They 're here . I 'm going to have a talk with them ! " " Wait ! Do it in the morning when we 're all calmed down ! " " I 'm going to do it now ! " " No ! You 'll only say things you 'll regret . Wait till everybody 's rested . " Disregarding her , Ken opened the bedroom door and walked into the hall . In the dim light he saw Molly and John standing halfway up the stairs , Molly a step above John , leaning over and embracing  | him , with John almost lifting her . " I love you , " Ken heard her say before his heavy tread startled them and they broke apart , their faces white , staring up at him . Instinctively Ken retreated into his room and shut his door , and he had no way of knowing how distraught and how angry his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance at the head of the stairs had been . A moment later he heard the sound of hurrying footsteps as Molly ran through the hall to her room . Leaning against his closed bedroom door , Ken pressed his forehead against the cool wood . He felt dizzy . " Ken , are you all right ? " Sylvia asked . " Yes . " " What 's the matter ? " " I guess you 're right . I should wait till morning . " " Of course . Come to bed now , darling . They 're home and there 's nothing to worry about any more . " Back in bed , Ken lay trying to formulate the talk he was going to deliver to Molly in the morning . You must wait , the gist of it was ; you must not give yourself too easily . You must be practical . You must realize that passions , once aroused , are not easily controlled . You must be sure that a boy like John is honest in his affections . It is hard for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many young men standing in washrooms boasting of their conquests , describing each whisper of love as a personal victory . " Boy , what a night ! " I 've heard them boast , and I 've seen the evil grins upon their faces . It sounds ridiculous to you I know , he thought of himself saying , but it would be more normal for John to be like that at his age than not . You must learn to be master of your emotions , he thought he would say . Do not let a boy like John take advantage of you . It will be years before you can be married . Meanwhile , it is better for you to be careful , to permit a good-night kiss perhaps , but only a circumspect one . Be chaste , he thought he would say . Oh , for your own sake , be chaste ! Be conventional . It is not right for a girl your age to be out with a boy till dawn . Be home by midnight after this , and no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . . . All this developed in his mind into such a puritanical lecture that finally his sense of irony was aroused . What a great moralist I in my middle age have become , he thought ; how stern I am about the morals of others !  | Remembering his old longings for Sylvia when she had been Molly 's age , remembering his dreams of going to a far land where seventeen-year-old girls could be married in the fullness of their beauty instead of wasting their youth away , he smiled wryly at himself . I should not be surprised , he thought , to find that what I want for my daughter is exactly opposite to what I wanted for myself . Outside his window the first light of dawn turned the bedroom gray . I must be realistic when I speak to Molly , he thought ; God knows I 'm old enough and I 've been through enough to have something sensible to say . I can not tell my daughter to welcome passion , to be proud of her beauty , to take joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be a nice idyl , but it is hardly the sort of advice which would be best for her now . He had , he recalled , heard of " modern " parents who gave their children complete license and who even provided them with contraceptives , but that thought was so hideous that he could not stomach it . That could happen only in a debauched family , he thought ; that would not be encouraging love at all , that would be destroying it . Such a thing could only be the final degradation for everyone concerned . So , he asked himself , what is my advice to my daughter ? Kiss a little , but not too much . Do not allow a boy to make love to you , but do not be too angry if he tries , do not freeze yourself . Do not be too chaste nor not chaste enough at seventeen . Be a half virgin , for that is the rule of your world , and such rules can not be trespassed against . We do not live in Samoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allow yourself to be fondled , to be half had in the back seats of cars if you must , but always draw back in time ; restrain yourself ; give no final fulfillment either to yourself or to the man you love . And if you can not be half chaste , be the complete , eternal virgin like Helen and old Margaret ; be shocked by sex ; be sterile . Or accomplish if you can the ideal of your world : withhold yourself completely before marriage and give yourself completely afterward . Be a quickchange artist . How ridiculous it all is , Ken thought : there simply is no honest advice on this subject which can be passed between the generations . Shall we all maintain a frightened silence ? Look , Molly , he thought of himself as saying a little desperately . People with healthy emotional lives can love without having to find  | physical expression right away . Your love will be greater if you can save it . The economic capacity for parenthood is a necessary preliminary to love in this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YMCA counselor I begin to sound ; how big the words get when the truth is left behind ! " The economic capacity for parenthood is a necessary preliminary to love " indeed ! Poor Molly , he thought ; after all Helen and I have put her through , I expect her to be perfectly sensible . Do not be starved , I want to say to her ; do not be hungry ; wait patiently for love , wait until it is convenient . My daughter , he thought ; that is the trouble ; she is my daughter and oh , she 's seen love run hot and cold , she has . A father has no right to be horrified at seeing his child turn out to be the image of himself . I , the great moralist , did not have such a patient youth ; no , in the grove of pines with Sylvia that night , I read no moral lectures , no exhortations to virtue , and I have never really been sorry . Do not be like me : that is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And do not be like Helen , and do not be as Sylvia was at your age ; do not withhold and do not give ; just wait ; youth should be a time of suspended animation , and I have almost forgotten the loneliness and the hunger , the impatience , and the waste , and that is good , for if I remembered those too clearly I could give no fatherly advice . " Ken , " Sylvia said , " are you still awake ? " " Yes . " " What are you thinking about ? " " I 'm trying to figure out what we should say to the children . " " I wish I could talk to John , but I ca n't , " Sylvia said . " I 'm afraid he would think me an utter hypocrite . " " Molly will probably think that of me too . God knows what Helen has told her about us . " Ken finally fell into a fitful sleep . Awaking at nine , he dressed quickly and went down to breakfast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven Ken went upstairs and with sudden timidity knocked on Molly 's door . " Who is it ? " she asked sharply . " Me , " Ken said in his deep bass . " If you 're awake , I 'd like to talk to you a minute . "  | " Come in , " she said , her voice tight . He opened the door . Molly was half sifting with the bedclothes pulled modestly up to her chin . It was immediately apparent to Ken that she knew what he had come to talk about and that she was both scared and defiant . He sat down on the foot of her bed . " What do you want ? " she asked , and her stare was so direct that he found himself momentarily tongue-tied . " I just wanted to caution you a little . . . " he began . " About what ? " " You and Johnny . . . " " I 'm in love with him , " she said , barely above a whisper . He answered before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're too young ! " he said . " You 've got to be sensible ! " He did not mean to make his voice sound angry . He saw her expression change ; it was almost as though she had slipped a mask over her face , and he knew suddenly and with despair that there would be no more confidences between them . " We will be sensible , " she said , her voice flat and ironic . " I mean . . . " he began again , but he did not really know what he meant . For a moment they stared at each other wordlessly . " I just want to help , " he said finally . " I do n't want to see you get yourself into a mess . " " I know , " Molly said , dropping her eyes . " If you do n't mind , I 'd like to get dressed now . " " All right ! " he said gruffly . He got up clumsily and kissed her on the forehead . Feeling completely helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he met John . Not wanting to face him at that moment , Ken said " Good morning ! " rather brusquely , and brushed by him to the front door . John saw him smash his fist into the palm of his hand with exasperation , and the noise seemed almost as loud as a clap of thunder .  | 29 " I 'M GLAD TO SEE that you are entering into more of the school 's activities , " Mr. Caulfield said in May , six weeks after Easter vacation . " Yes , sir , " John replied . " Of course , your record here has been an extraordinary one , but in my report to the admissions officer at Harvard I did feel obligated to say you were an oddly solitary boy . It was the only mark against you . " Yes , sir . " " " Of course you got the scholarship anyway , but I think I will send in an addendum to my report , saying that we have helped you to become more gregarious . " " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , it will look very good on your record , as a counterbalance to your academic and athletic distinctions , " Mr. Caulfield continued . " The well-rounded boy  --  it 's what all the colleges want . I think perhaps you might apply for a bigger scholarship . " " Thank you , sir . " " They have a few which cover room and board . I 'll see what I can do for you , " Mr. Caulfield concluded . The school band , a nine-piece affair , practiced in the gymnasium every Friday night . Ted Farlough was good on the trumpet , and Fred Cohn was terrific on the drums , and the others struggled along as best they could : John walked to the gymnasium now to practice with them . Ted and the others were already warming up . " Come on , Johnny , " they said . " Get on the mike . " The band swung into an old one , " East of the Sun and West of the Moon . " John let them run through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he sang , " and west of the moon , we 'll build a dream house for two , dear , east of the sun in the day and west of the moon at night . . . " " Man , that 's wonderful ! " Art Bradshaw said . " You 're wasting your time with Latin , boy . " " Thanks , " John said , embarrassed . " To tell you the truth , I never liked that song . What else have we got ? " It was that evening that Mr. Nealy , newly returned to the school  | after a long absence , knocked on the door of John 's room . " Telephone call for you , " he said . " Long distance . " John hurried to the booth on the bottom floor of his dormitory . " Johnny ? " Molly said , her voice taut . " Yes ! Are you all right ? " " Oh , Johnny ! " the words were followed by an agonized silence . " Molly , what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a deep intake of breath . " It 's happened , " she said finally . " Are you sure ? " " Almost . " " Where are you ? Where are you now ? " " Drugstore , " she said . " Near school . Had to tell you . " " Have you told anyone else ? " " The doctor ! " The words were a gasp of agony . " I went out of town to see one ! " " Do n't cry ! " he said . " Please do n't ! We 'll figure this out . " " How ? Can you come here ? I need you so much , Johnny ! " " Of course I 'll come . " " When ? " " Tonight . I 'll start tonight . " " Oh , thank you , Johnny ! I had imagined awful things . " Immeasurable relief was in her voice . " I was afraid you 'd say it was no business of yours , " she said . " Molly ! We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose this is terrible to say , but I 'm glad . " " Oh , Johnny ! " " Except for hurting you . " " What will we do ? " " Get married ! " " How ? " " We 'll figure a way . " " I feel so ashamed ! " Agony again . " Nuts ! " he said , the word coming out like a crack of a whip . " Do n't talk like that , Molly ! Cut that stuff out ! We 're going to handle this together , and everything will be all right , but you 've got to quit being ashamed . " " I 'll try , " she said .  | " If anybody should be ashamed , I should . Let me be ashamed for both of us . It 's easier on me . " " All right . " Her voice was meek . " Now listen . Dry your eyes and go back to school and wait for me . We ought to keep this secret till we figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long it will take me to get there , but I 'll make it as soon as I possibly can . We need a chance to talk and figure things out . When I come , pretend I 'm your brother or something . " " They know I do n't have a brother . " " O.K. So I 'm asking you out on a date . Does that school let you have dates ? " " Just on weekends . On weekdays you can call on us in the common room . " " Tomorrow 's Thursday , " he said . " I 'll be in the common room as soon as I can . " " But what are we going to do ? " she asked . " Give me a chance to think , but I know we can figure it out . O.K. ? " " O.K. , " she said . " I 'll be there as soon as I possibly can . Goodbye , darling . " " Goodbye , " she said , and before the click of her hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He had been calm up till then , but upon leaving the telephone booth he felt suddenly confused . He had to get permission to leave the school  --  if he just ran away , they would look for him , and that would add another complication . He needed money immediately . How much did a train ticket cost to Virginia ? He had no idea . Could he get a plane ? Again no idea . Money  --  that was the first thing . He ought to get a hundred dollars , and he wished he had n't torn up the checks Sylvia had sent him . In his school bank account , he had only seven dollars left from his Easter vacation . No money . Nobody to borrow a hundred dollars from at Colchester Academy . The masters would ask questions , arid the boys would n't have it to give . No money . Panic took him . Maybe it would be simply impossible for him to go immediately . Of course not . He could hitchhike if necessary . Make it almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headmaster . Say there was a family emergency . Father sick . Have to make some excuse like that anyway  | to get permission to go . No point in having Caulfield set the cops searching for him . But if there was a real emergency like that , would n't the family wire money ? Old Caulfield would get suspicious if John not only wanted to leave without official word from the family , but also asked to borrow money . And if he got suspicious , he might prevent John even from hitchhiking  --  he might keep an eye on him or something , and even lock him in his room if he were caught slipping out with a suitcase . And then he would n't be able to go at all . No . This has to be done right , John at the age of eighteen thought . No mistakes . And immediately a plan formed itself , a lie based on the truth . " Mr. Caulfield , " John said to the headmaster fifteen minutes later . " I 've just received some pretty bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear that , " Mr. Caulfield replied , his voice full of concern . " What is it ? " " It 's kind of embarrassing , sir . " " You can tell me , son ! " Mr. Caulfield always thought himself a very understanding person . The boys could bring him all their problems , he said . " Well , it 's my father , sir . He , well , sometimes he drinks too much . " " I 'm sorry to hear that , " Mr. Caulfield said , although he had heard it before from other sources . He always kept a thorough record on " the home situation . " " I guess he 's been drinking too much lately , especially too much , I mean , and he 's sick . The woman who worked for him quit two days ago , he was so hard to get along with . This woman , old Martha Hulbert , started driving to Florida to look for work , but in Virginia she got worried about Dad . Said her conscience bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me up . Said she thought I should take a visit home , maybe put Dad in the hospital . I just got this long-distance call from Virginia . " " I 'm sorry to hear that , " Mr. Caulfield said . " Do n't you have any relatives you can call on ? " " Well , you know Dad and Mother are divorced . " " It 's a hard job for a young boy , " Mr. Caulfield said . " Putting his father in the hospital . Especially in this sort of situation . Is n't there anyone who could help ? " " Yes , sir , " John said . " All kinds of friends are on the mainland . If
