Since fencing is the most exciting participant game in which two persons may indulge , it would seem to me that a small fortune might await someone who could devise a method of teaching it that would be less tedious than the existing curriculum and would take a year or two off the time it takes to learn how to skewer your opponent properly while yourself remaining unharmed. // For the art has everything to recommend it to the passionate competitor or the tired businessman in need of exercise and relaxation . It is cheap ; it is convenient in that it may be conducted in any fair-sized room or hallway , on a terrace , lawn or in a cellar . Salles devoted to it are conveniently located in big cities . It is not time consuming ; an hour and a half between five-thirty in the afternoon and seven is sufficient , including shower and changing . Three times a week is enough to keep a man fit , entertained and happy . // And it is enthrallingly exciting " and absorbing . In the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a man may master another ? if you exclude boxing , which is , of course , only a game for hopeless adolescents willing to have their brains addled and features warped to prove not very much . // LEARNING TAKES PATIENCE // Unfortunately , it takes time to learn fencing 's unnatural posture and simplest maneuvers , to train the legs , the eyes and , above all , the hand . It takes even more time to become sufficiently experienced in combat to enjoy to the full the delights of making a monkey out of a fellow citizen ? or citizeness , since one of the three weapons , the foil , may be practiced in mixed company . // The fencer never stops taking lessons to the end of his days . And those days are long for , unlike other sportsmen , the fencer may continue to compete and enjoy himself through the sixties and into the seventies . One of the toughest old boys in the Epee Club of London , who still fights and places regularly in club fixtures , is 74. // Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't work with fencing . It takes the beginner six months before he gets his legs sorted out and another month before his hand responds automatically to stimuli . After two years he can begin to fight in earnest . But all the time he is learning he is getting exercise employing limb and wind , doing hard , sweat-producing work , disciplining himself and acquiring the rudiments of a fascinating skill which will never leave him . // To begin with a few definitions , there are three standard international weapons available : the foil , the epee and the saber . They are different in size , shape and weight and each has its own set of rules . // The foil is a light , whippy , four-sided blade with a button on the end . Its target is the torso only . // The epee is a stiff , three-sided dueling sword , an adaptation of the rapier , with a large bell , or guard . Its target encompasses the entire body from mask to shoe tip , including hands and arms , its pseudo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly . In many tournaments one touch settles the issue , for it is assumed that if one were hit anywhere by this weapon , one would be unable to continue . It is symbolically deadly and hence most interesting . // The saber is both a cutting and a thrusting weapon ; the whole upper part of the body is vulnerable , including head and arms , and the rules of attack , parry and riposte are such that experienced sabreurs communicate with one another in phrases in the manner of people engaged in performing a duet on instruments . Indeed , the French word " phrase " is a part of saber language and denotes a series of questions and replies via the blades , so that their clashing sings a recognizable song . The cutting and slashing movements appeal to ? well , cutters and slashers. // EVERYWHERE I ROAM // I started fencing when I was 36 . Today , 20 years later , I can hold my own in good company ; I compete on club teams in New York , London and Paris , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. and British Nationals , take lessons regularly , keep my weight down and never travel without jacket , shoes and glove . Mask and weapons I can borrow wherever I happen to be , for fencing is a brotherhood as well as a sport . // Thus I have fenced in Istanbul , Athens , Paris , Tel Aviv , Marseilles , Rome , Florence , Milan and Venice , London and The Hague . I fence crossing the Atlantic on the Queen Elizabeth , the Queen Mary and the Ile de France . Upon arriving in a strange city at home or abroad , I commission the hotel porter or concierge to ferret out a fencing club or fencing master . A couple of hours later I am on the strip , with the local boys queuing up to take a crack at the visiting fireman . // My specialty is the epee , or dueling sword . My second weapon is the foil . Today , at 56 , I have begun taking saber lessons ? left-handed . Five years from now I will be a fair saber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure enough , the legs have gone and the reactions have slowed down , but the guile increases . I ca n't catch the youngsters any more , but if a kid wants to hit me he 's got to come close enough to touch . That 's all I ask . Youth is served , but fencing really is a game for the middle-aged and the mature . Captain Charles De Beaumont recently won back the British epee championship at the age of 52 . It is great for the ego when , aging but knowledgeable , you flummox some flaming and impetuous youth and coax him to impale himself on your point . // In boxing you feint with foot , head or hand . You do the same in fencing . In a fight you take the initiative , moving in with leads or back-pedal and wait for a chance to counter . The same holds for a sword fight . With gloves you try to block an opponent 's lead or jab . With a weapon this is called a parry . And in the ring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you try to knock his head off with a timed counterpunch . Fencers call the same thing a riposte . And the purpose of both games is to hit without being hit in return . // But whereas boxing is brutal , inflicting pain and eventually serious injury to brain or optic nerve , the fencer is protected by canvas jacket , wire mask and glove . Injury is the result of accident rather than design . The fencer 's aim is to establish an intellectual as well as a physical superiority over an opponent . To do so , he uses an adaptation of the same steel weapon with which men once disputed in terms of life and death . // One of the chief charms of fencing is that it is never quite possible to divorce the sport in one 's own mind from its romantic and lethal background . And in spite of precautions , accidents do happen from time to time . In epee fighting the three-pronged , needle-sharp pointes d'arret fastened to the tip of the weapon to aid in registering hits by catching in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in material or seam and slit open a segment of epidermis , which bleeds most satisfactorily . Sabers can leave a handsome welt . A broken foil can become instantaneously dangerous and deadly . // Steel is a man 's weapon . It has always been the great equalizer . Little men have brought big men crashing like storm-stricken oaks by sliding six inches of it gently into their bodies . Speed and guile offset brawn and size ; trickery can take the measure of knowledge . The men who fought with the sword risked everything , for to carry death to an opponent they had perforce to expose themselves . In this age , defeat is the penalty instead of death . But when you go into a bout , the old ghosts seem to rise up beside you and whisper , " Careful ? do n't let him come too close ? he may be going to try the Italian trick* ? keep your point menacing his eyes ? a man is afraid for his eyes ? do n't believe that opening where his sword arm has dropped ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believed that once , and look ? I am dead ! " // One of the most fascinating sides to fencing is its revelation of a man 's character . By his point ye shall know him . His style and comportment give him away . A few minutes with a man on the strip and you will know whether he is timid , aggressive , honest , dishonest , trusting , deceitful , tricky , guileless , decisive or indecisive , stubborn or easily swayed , impetuous or craftily patient . You read him like a book and you yourself are not able to conceal from him for long what kind of human being you are . // Personally , I find the stiff , triangular-bladed dueling rapier known as the epee the most satisfying of the three weapons , possibly because of the three sharp points affixed to the tip which achieve an actual penetration into some part of the opponent 's clothing , for penetration is the swordsman 's aim and satisfaction even if , in fencing 's civilized adaptation , it is no more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang and sometimes even draw a small quantity of blood . I do not particularly enjoy bashing a man on the nose with my fist and seeing him drip gore , but to prick an opponent with my steel and see his jacket stain a little pink at wrist or elbow is , for me , a thrill . // Oddly , it is just as enjoyable to suffer a slight wound in this game and later sport the cicatrice . I once had some five inches of forearm ploughed open when the epee prongs entered a defective seam in the leather-and-canvas glove . My opponent made profuse apologies and did his best to look concerned , but found it difficult to conceal his delight , particularly when examination revealed that the cut , though long , was superficial . About this time I began to feel noble and gallant myself , the wounded warrior . Epee points always leave scars ; mine proclaims that I am a sword fighter and I will exhibit it at very slight provocation . // Epee matches are the only kind which may be scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords whose points depress a small spring that makes a connection to ring a bell and light a light when a hit is scored . The fighting of this weapon affords the deepest psychological satisfaction , for it eliminates all human error as well as human vanity . The **26;33;TOOLONG fencer is at the mercy of this loaded sword that rings out its own victory and illuminates the victim . Menaced with it , you fence as carefully and tensely as though your life depended on it , straining to avoid its viper bite and the public humiliation resulting when your opponent slips beneath your guard or otherwise diddles you to light your light and ring your bell . // The rules and punctilio of fencing ? the salute with the weapon , the repetition of this gesture and the handshake at the end of the match , the gentlemanly restraint , the immediate and unswerving acknowledgment of a hit when there are no arbiters present ? are modern and artificial adjuncts to a game which , when conducted for business or political purposes a half a millennium ago , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play bore little or no resemblance to modern bouts with foil , epee or saber . // As a matter of fact , no two ancient weapons were alike , as each bravo purchased his sword or had it made to suit his own measurements or heft ? long , short , whippy , stiff-bladed , hilt-or point-heavy ? and the only rule when steel was unsheathed was kill and kill quickly , if necessary by foul means , such as throwing a handful of dirt into your opponent 's eyes . // The origin of the development of " seconds " in duels had a most practical basis and came about when the challenged party to a duel in the bois , foolish enough to arrive alone for the encounter , found himself set upon by friends of the challenger who held him while the challenger ran him through and then went off to take bows . Eventually the news leaked out and the boys took to showing up with friends of their own , which often led to a free-for-all on the spot and later to the punctilio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later still to the purely representative function of the second . // You might believe that fencing calls for a certain kind of excitable foreign temperament , and one tends to think of the sport mostly in connection with fiery Europeans with moustaches . But the fact is that fencing has a temperament , a life and behavior all its own which it grafts onto Anglo-Saxons , Americans , Swedes , Englishmen , Danes or what not , for they all shout and yell on the strip and carry on like maniacs . I have seen some very cold British fish in action , including doctors , Q.C . ' s , businessmen and a Sea Lord , and it moves them all alike . Only the week before writing this I was in a competition at the Lansdowne Club in London ; there were ten of us , nine Englishmen and one American , and there we were shouting , hollering and running at one another , stamping our feet and bellowing " Ho ! " and " Ha ! " and " He la ! , " cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un-British . Temperament was all over the place . // TIMIDITY WILL GET YOU NOWHERE // You bellow or shout at your opponent for two reasons . One is to panic , frighten or at least disconcert him , a perfectly legitimate and permissible maneuver in what is otherwise a gentleman 's game . The other reason is that , during a long mental duel which frequently precedes the physical clash ? a period of lightninglike feints , probes , shiftings of feet , head , hands , changes of distance , maneuvers for range and balance ? the tension becomes so unbearable that release brings explosion . Once the die is cast and the attack is launched , bringing on the fury of crashing blades , cries are torn from the contestants that they are unable to control . // Fencing , more than any other sport I know , is a game of will power and spirit . There is no quicker way to get licked than to take the strip timidly , in awe of an opponent . On the other hand , there are few games where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset and impose his will upon the other long before swords or bodies have clashed . I once met , fenced and beat an Olympic champion before I knew who he was . I missed the name . To me he was just another Joe with anepee in his hand and I set out to take him . Later , when I found out who he was and we fenced again , he murdered me. // In fencing , there are periods where two opponents are in contact with another through the medium of two thin shafts of steel . These are very like antennae down whose length messages of strength , weakness , anticipation , nerves , tensions , plan and counterplan are broadcast . Each pressure on the blade , each beat , each probing for the weak and strong of the weapon has its separate meaning to both fencers . It is as though , while the intellect is occupied moving feet and bodies for advantageous positions , the swords were holding an independent conversation , most of which is wool-over-the-eyes , shameless deceit , a blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fencer does the expected is when he has managed to make it wholly unexpected to do so . The element of surprise is vital and a crafty fighter will spend minutes building up premises of false security in his opponent 's mind , deluding , seducing and lulling him . // Again , a wary opponent will suddenly realize that his nervous and quivering blade is telling too much and not only giving him away but affording his opponent the opportunity to take command of it . Then he will disengage himself and his steel from all contact . With communication broken , the men become like two wary fighting cocks , for now it has become a pure guessing game but one which can instantaneously explode into violent action as each attempts to lead the other into mistakes . // It is a creative game , since one is constantly improvising . Yet there is little in fencing for the spectator and in particular the layman , for this is an affair of feeling as well as participating or seeing . It is a highly emotional sport , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observers usually high and dry , with only an occasional visibly pretty hit to applaud . // $50 AND YOU 'RE IN BUSINESS // And now , should you find yourself interested in joining our company of the romantically bemused , here is a quick rundown on what is needed . Since all fencing begins with lessons in the classic fleuret or foil , acquire a pair of these , costing four or five dollars apiece , a mask , glove and jacket . Slacks and ordinary sneakers will do for the beginner . The whole outfit wo n't cost more than fifty dollars and will last for years . // You can find a fencing master and take private lessons but it is better to join a fencing club and become steeped in the curious and appealing atmosphere of fencers and fencing . The club professional will give you lessons and the older members and club hot-shots will give you tips and fence with you occasionally and keep you from forming bad habits before your good ones are set . The first year or so it is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home and lunge at it every day . Makes for accuracy and teaches you to aim and keep your point in line . It is a good idea to start kids when they are 14 or 15 , but you can begin at any age and become a good performer if you are not in too much of a hurry . // One thing I can promise you : you 'll thank me someday if I have managed to get you started . You can take the word of one who has had a crack at most games played by two or more people . For sheer fun and excitement , fencing beats them all . // * In the 15th century , an Italian master , Achilles Gazaio , came to Paris and grew wealthy teaching the bravos one trick ? passing the blade of the sword through the legs of the opponent , then drawing it back quickly and cutting the tendon back of the knee . Once brought to earth , the victim could be finished off at leisure .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
