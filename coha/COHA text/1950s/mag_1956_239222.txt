Onstage , dancers pranced about in the guise of poets , unicorns and gorgons . In the pit , a chorus sang words as the dancers gestured in silent mime . On the end seat of a row up front , Composer Gian Carlo Menotti ( Saint of Bleecker Street , Amahl and the Night Visitors ) nervously twisted a piece of paper in his hands and silently moved his lips , for no composer in modern times had tried a musical brew quite like the strange goings-on in that Washington auditorium last week . It was Composer Menotti 's latest opus , The Unicorn , the Gorgon , and the Manticore , + or The Three Sundays of a Poet , " a madrigal fable for chorus , ten dancers and nine instruments . " <P> Remembered Beasts . The work was almost not performed at all . Commissioned last year by the Library of Congress to compose something for the twelfth chamber-music festival of the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation , Menotti remembered the story-telling madrigal cycles of Orazio ( L'Amfiparnaso ) Vecchi , a 16th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote after reading The Book of Beasts , began to plot a work that is part masque , part ballet , part chamber music . But Menotti never puts notes on paper till the last minute , was sending madrigals to Choreographer John Butler as he finished them , did not complete the final one until a week before the premiere . The ballet 's first run-through came only four days before the public was to see it . At the last minute Conductor Thomas Schippers announced he could not conduct because , as Menotti admitted , " he has to conduct at the Met next week , and still has half of my work to learn . " Paul Callaway , organist of Washington Cathedral , had to be drafted on short notice to conduct the premire before a tough audience of top-rank musicians , critics and composers . <P> Chained Fancies . In twelve madrigals , six orchestral interludes and a march , Menotti tells a pointed tale of a poet who lives in a castle , yawns at town meetings , and goes neither to church nor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Sunday leading a unicorn by a silver chain , he is mocked , but soon the entire town is parading unicorns as pets . The next Sunday he is parading a gorgon , says he has " peppered and grilled " the unicorn , and soon all the pet unicorns have been killed , and gorgons are the rage . On the third Sunday the poet appears with a manticore , says the gorgon has died " of murder , " which brings the same fate to the town 's other gorgons , and manticores become the latest craze . When the poet appears no more , the townsfolk are infuriated , march on his castle to torture and kill him for his " crimes . " They find him dying , surrounded by his unicorn , gorgon and manticore , symbolizing the poet 's youth , manhood and old age . In elaborate and haunting four-voice counterpoint , the chorus , speaking for the miming poet , asks , " How could I destroy the pain-wrought children of my fancy ? " The sprightly , gay , 43-minute work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sings almost liturgically , as if each voice were a pipe in an organ . <P> Oh , foolish people <P> Who feign to feel <P> What other men have suffered , <P> You , not I , are the indifferent killers <P> Of the poet 's dreams .
