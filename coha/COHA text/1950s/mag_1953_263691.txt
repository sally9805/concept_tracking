With these traditional words , U.S. lawyers respectfully catch the ears of the learned judges hearing their appeals . Briggs v. Elliott , Case No. 2 of the five segregation cases heard last week by the Supreme Court , pitted together two of the legal profession 's great advocates : <P> <P> JOHN WILLIAM DAVIS , 80 , a white-maned , majestic figure in immaculate morning attire who looks type-cast for the part , has argued more cases ( 140 ) before the Supreme Court of the U.S. than any other lawyer living or dead . His first , Pickens v. Roy , came on in 1902-when the present Chief Justice of the U.S. was eleven . Big Steel paid John W. Davis more than $100,000 last year to win the historic Steel Seizure case ( Youngstown Sheet &; Tube v. Sawyer ) . Davis ' fee for taking segregation 's side last week was more modest : a silver tea service , gift of the South Carolina legislature . <P> As senior partner of the 104-year-old Wall Street firm of Davis Polk Wardwell Sunderland &; Kiendl ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &T.,; Standard Oil Co . ( N.J. ) , Guaranty Trust Co. of New York , International Paper Co. , et al . He did not need another client , and he already owned a tea service . Davis took the segregation case partly because an old friend , South Carolina 's Governor James F. Byrnes , asked him to , partly as a matter of constitutional ( states ' rights ) and social conviction ( " Race is a fact , like sex " ) . Some of his other friends were sorry to hear him , at twilight , singing segregation 's old unsweet song . But the popularity of a cause rarely cuts any ice with John W. Davis . One of his permanent heroes is Chrtien Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes , who ( at 71 ) defied popular opinion by defending Louis XVI before a French revolutionary tribunal . Advocate Malesherbes lost his case , his royal client 's neck , and his own , but not his place in legal history ; Advocate Davis knows his own standing is equally secure . <P> No Trimmings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John W. Davis took another memorably unpopular position . In 1924 , after a steppingstone career as a law professor at Virginia 's Washington &; Lee , West Virginia state legislator , member of Congress , Solicitor General of the U.S. and Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , Davis was being talked about as presidential material . A supporter urged him to drop J. P. Morgan as a client so that he would be more palatable to the Bryan Democrats , to whom Wall Street was a dirty word . Davis refused : " Any lawyer who trims his professional course to fit the gusts of popular opinion . . . degrades the great profession . . . " <P> Davis was nominated anyway-as a compromise candidate , on the 16th day and 103rd ballot , by a sweltering , weary , deadlocked Democratic convention . ( Vicepresidential candidate : Charles W. Bryan , brother of William Jennings Bryan . ) The predictable happened : W. J. Bryan deserted , La Follette started a third party , the Hearst press excoriated Davis as THE MORGAN LAWYER ( Columnist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be " The Star-Spangled Banker " ) , and Cal Coolidge won going away . The Democratic candidate polled 8,386,000 votes-only 29%.
