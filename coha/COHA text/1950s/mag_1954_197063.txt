Old Russian Habit Old Russian Habit Sir : Long before ace reporters were ever born to cover the Geneva Conference , William Shakespeare knew the Russian tactics and types of talk bandied by them ( Love 's Labour 's Lost ) : We jour , indeed , confronted were with four In Russian habit : here they stay 'd an hour , And talk 'd apace ; and in that hour , my lord , They did not bless us with one happy word . <P> MIREILLE DE FISSE Marseille , France <P> Added Shakespeare : <P> . . . Frozen Muscovits . . . <P> Will they not , think you , hang themselves . . . ? - ED . <P> <P> The Heroes of Dienbienphu <P> Sir : Your reporting on " The Fall of Dienbien phu " TIME , May 17 was a masterful exhibition of journalism . <P> CLARENCE CURRY JR . Omaha <P> Sir : <P> . . . This tragic fight at Dienbienphu , instead of splitting French opinion , brings unanimity and greater courage for the ever-increasing majority of French non-Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French government for being lousy ; they should try to improve their own . . . <P> FRANOIS BALLANDE Boulogne-Billancourt , France <P> Sir : <P> . . . Was it necessary to say so bluntly May 10 that " the U.S. had counted postwar France as a great power , and in agonizing reappraisal , the U.S. now knew that this had been a great mistake " ? . . . Surely the defense of Dienbienphu was in the highest tradition of French arms . . . <P> CHARLES H. RUSSELL New York City <P> Sir : <P> . . . Why do we try to play ball with the decadent French nation , which is eroded by Communism , De Gaullism , money-bagism , and political frustration ? Apparently it will not . . . face up to the necessities of unity , discipline and responsibility . . . Let 's have the " agonizing reappraisal " and shape a policy of action that will omit France from any plans as a key factor for defense of the free world . <P> MARGARET M. KELLY Long Branch , N.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many thanks for all your enlightening news on Chou En-lai TIME , May 10 - the kind of information so badly needed . You handled the deadliest weapon against the threatening Communistic . . . systems in the widespread publication of the naked truth on the personalities of these Red gods and the crimson trails of their careers ... I have no doubt that the terrible truth of such consistent information will have greater effect than the now flourishing hate campaigns launched by the Russian press . . . <P> R. DOORMAN Lagos , Nigeria British West Africa <P> Sir : During the days of the united front in China ( 1938-39 ) before the Stalin-Matsu-oka pact , my husband George Fitch went to Yenan from Chungking with Chou Enlai . <P> The truck on which they traveled was so overcrowded that they rode atop the driver 's cab . At that time , Chou-as well as the other Chinese Communist leaders-wore peasant garb and espoused poverty . Chou was very friendly ; Mao Tse-tung even asked my husband to come back and organize a Y.M.C.A. in Yenan . Both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese Communist Party . . . <P> In 1946 my husband was regional director for UNRRA in Honan , where a stupendous project for land reclamation was being implemented by the Nationalist government . . .
