txt Karl R. Bendetsen. assistant secretary of the army , said the Defense Department 's request for $6,500 million to build new military facilities is only " one instalment " of a huge program . Appearing on a radio forum , he said the sum asked for the coming 24 months would not supply the armed forces " with what would be required in the event of a full-scale war . " " We need not mislead ourselves that it is , " he said . - We will come back with further instalments and re-evaluate the program from time to time . " Base for " Dynamic Expansion " Mr. Bendetsen said the requested sum is part of a building program designed to create " a mobilization base which ought to be capable of dynamic expansion in the event a full-scale war is forced upon us . " " This is a program designed to avoid such a war , " he added . The construction plans call for expansion of existing military bases and erection of new ones in this country and In many places throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases , some of them reportedly in Europe , on the Mediterranean and in North AfricaMuch of the proposed work is so secret it is not specifically mentioned in the legislation . A total of $1,500 million is for unlisted projects . The $6,500 million instalment already has passed its first congressional hurdle with little actual money chopped out , although there will be a paper saving this year of $2 billion . The House Armed Services Committee , which is considering the request , claims it has reduced global Army and Navy building plans by close to $1 billion . It . says it intends to knock out another billion or more from Air Force projects on which it starts work today . Actually , members conceded privately , real cuts made so far total a mere .7.25 million and slashes proposed for the Air Force are nothing but lipOkkeeping reductions . Conflictiing Figures ' The conflicting figures are explained by the committee 's policy of authorizing for each project only the sum for which money is to be appropriated during the present fiscal year that began July 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take two or more years to complete , this means most of them have been trimmed substantially  --  on paper . This is contrary to normal practice . Congress usually authorizes a big construction job in full although it may ? take years to build . appropriating the necessary money for the various stages of work from year to year . Some committee members contend delaying part of the authorization does not save anything , in fact may result in higher costs in the long run . They argue that if you are going to approve a 10-story building , it doesn'tcut the cost to contract for only five stories at a time . Finletter Asks Fuel Authorizations Air Force Secretary Thomas K. Finletter pleaded with the commitee Friday not to fellow the one-year-at-a-time policy on Air Force projects . He said the full projec should be authorized , both to save time and to head off any impressjpn that Congress is cutting down because of the Korean truce situation . Rep. Overton Brooks ( D. , La. ) , top-ranking committee Democrat , defended the committee 's policy because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy of the country can only take so much strain . " Appearing on the same program with Mr. Bendetsen , he said the Defense Department should go ahead with the long-range plans , but Congress should legislate from year to year to hold waste to a minimum . Mr. Bendetsen said the new building program should be under way this fall " within a month " after Congress provides the money . In many cases , he said , the money will be used " to build longer and stronger runways to accommodate the pressure of jet aircraft . to provide facilities to accommodate the new groups and the shore part of naval air , and in the Army for construction of numerous warehouses . " Explaining the warehouse plan , he said the Defense Department Is trying to set up production lines to produce the arms that would be required for full-scale war , without actually turning out the arms now . " We are not trying , to produce all that would be required for a full-scale war , but just enough to tide us over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put it and protect it for an indefinite period , " he explained . Expansion of Installations He said the building program also involves sonic expansion of troop and training Installations . including plans for eight " railhead facilities " that will be stripped down to the bone with underground utilities provided . a few storm houses and overhead utilities so that in time of war our units could move right in and be accommodated . " We are building the skeleton with firm bones . " he added . Four real cuts have been made by the committee in considering the construction program so far , two for the Army and two for the Navy . They are : Army : Boston , Mass . Staging Ai ea. for land . utilities , general construction , cut from $4,281,000 to $4,181,000 ; Fort Eustis , Va. , troop housing , land , utilities . cut from $45 , - 903.000 to $45.440,500 . Navy : Jacksonville . Fla .. supply depot , $17,919,800 , deleted : unlisted secret work , cut from $126,362,500 to $119,392,780 . All other projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full . in effect , although on paper most of them have been cut substantially .
