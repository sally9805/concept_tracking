go into action . Every morning after he had worked his two hours on the ship models , he would bathe in the sea and dress up in his costume . Then , swinging his walking stick and stroking his mustache he would saunter onto the main street of Puerto del Sol . He was like a fairy-tale character , setting out to seek his fortune and with every likelihood of being eaten by wolves instead . I could sense the tension in his manner . He was hungry and lunchtime was nearing . I could almost see his impalpable feelers probing , extending , withdrawing  --  sensitive to detect the opportunity which could be made to yield the food he needed and , if possible , a cocktail beforehand and a bit of flattery to boot . Russ depended upon a number of standardized routines to attract and trap tourists . His provocative appearance , of course , was good bait . So were his ships . Ladies often stopped to pat the dog , Biscuit . But if all else failed he used to seat himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers , would steal a cigarette lighter , a pen , or a pair of sunglasses from his neighbor 's table or reticule . A few moments later he would pretend to have found the stolen object and an introduction was gracefully effected . He had devised any number of believable ways of being called away before the check cause , after inviting some tourist to a drink or to tea . But his commonest routine  --  and the one which yielded the best results  --  was to meet the local bus each evening . Whenever he overheard some descending passenger speaking English , he would amble up and ask with a worried look , " Excuse me , sir . I wonder if you noticed a tall lady with gray hair , an , Englishwoman , on the bus . My aunt was supposed to arrive and I seem to have missed her . " The lonely tourist , already frazzled after a long day 's hassle with Spanish impracticality , would give a start of utter delight . Before long Russ was in his confidence , ordering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a hotel . Meanwhile the tourist was congratulating himself on having stumbled upon such a charming impromptu host . I T DID N'T matter which hotel Russ suggested . He got a straight 10 per cent from all of them for any guest he brought in . His ingenuity was taxed only if the tourist had thoughtlessly made a previous reservation . Then Russ , with the quick use of innuendo , had to make the tourist change his mind . If the tourist were an average one , he stayed for a fortnight , during which Russ could count on a minimum of a cup of coffee and a drink or two each day . In addition , particularly if Captain Russ arranged it , there would be a couple of picnic lunches and maybe a farewell dinner . If the tourist had any spare money he wanted souvenirs . Captain Russ told him where to buy the best and got 10 per cent from the shop . It must not be supposed that Captain Russ ever asked for money , or even cadged a drink . His dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a friendly superior toward a likable , though insignificant , inferior . Some of the tourists saw through his somewhat pathetic bravado after a few days , but they did n't seem to mind being ? put upon . Perhaps they did n't want to hurt his feelings . Some of them , I 'm sure , pretended to believe in him in order not to lose his company . There was something about Russ ' fraudulency which enchanted the tired office workers , the little clerks and shop owners who came to Puerto del Sol for their vacations . I used to see them following him with thirsty eyes as he walked along the quay . They even fought over him sometimes . He was a catch . He was romance in a gentle-manly form . Russ was snobbish in his choice of victims , favoring those who went well with his masquerade , those who added tone . Anyone with a bogus title , anyone who had published or painted attracted him almost as much as he attracted them . But the finest prey of all for Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred them attractive , pensioned , and disillusioned . During his first summer I witnessed Russ ' squiring of at least three such ladies . The first was an American widow who had taken to drink after her husband died in a plane accident . She was determined to go dramatically to pieces and Russ aided her in every way . The affair ended when a brother or cousin arrived and took her forcibly home . The second was a Swedish painter , a woman who had " exhibited " in Paris . She had come to the port after her children grew up and her husband took a mistress . She was n't exactly sad , but there was a doggedness in her insistence upon having her share of fun , even though a little late in life . I believe she left when her money ran out , but not until the whole town had participated in any number of heart-wrenching farewells . The third was English , also middle-aged , also lonely . The pattern was fairly well established , and when she too left for some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vantage point . on the veranda of the Hotel Bella Vista , took the tragedy as one of those predictable things . The ladies who became attached to Russ were rarely what one would expect , but ran to mousiness and shyness . Usually , when they discovered themselves being courted by a story-book outcast such as Russ they blushed and trembled and went to great lengths to disguise the trend of the affair . Soon the town would notice that the lady had discreetly rented a house  --  preferably a little way out of town where there were fewer observers . Soon Russ would appear in newer clothes . A curious domesticity shrouded each affair . The ladies would cook and dust for Russ , buy materials for his ship models . And he would begin to call them , each in her turn , Mummy . I often suspected that he called them all Mummy to spare himself the possible crisis of confusing names . There is no telling how many Mummies Russ sent back to their children and grandchildren , chastened perhaps , but happier . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time . Some of them even tried to get jobs for him , but he always rejected such offers . The small checks were enough to carry him over the lean times , and Russ instinctively knew , I think , that in a city office he would lose his glamor like a beach pebble taken out of the water . Captain Russ ' lean time , he freely confessed to us , was the winter . Tourists were scarce and chilly , and when the weather was rainy even the few foreign colony members in Puerto del Sol remained snug at home in front of their fireplaces . During these unproductive months Russ could sometimes be seen hunched on the pier , a fishing pole in his hands and an expression of patient disgust on his face . To keep alive he had taught himself where to find edible mushrooms , palm hearts , wild asparagus . He was sometimes reduced to rifling the cabbage and artichoke fields  --  a crime he considered beneath him . He took only the frayed and diseased vegetables , which probably would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thievery . He always carried a few grains of corn in his pocket in case he happened upon a strayed chicken . If he could entice the chicken to follow him home , his meals were assured for two or three days . But Russ abhorred demeaning himself in these ways . And if the tourist season werefruitful , he usually managed to stretch his credit through the winter . Last winter , though , Russ fared better than usual . Luck . came in the form of a lady whom we called the Countess . I remember her entrance well . When she stepped out of the taxi in front of the Bella Vista the quay-side loungers gasped . We were not used to fine feathers , nor to glamorous women . The Countess , though forty-five years old , had a rich , bedecked figure , glowing skin , and large , restless eyes . I wondered how she ever came to Puerto del Sol in the first place . The tranquil quay , peopled with fishermen mending their nets , with nuns on their way to mass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evident anxiety to leave . I overheard her saying to the waiter , " What does this place have  --  besides sunsets ? " She would certainly have gone the next day if she had n't spied Captain Russ that evening as he sauntered in for the mail . I saw her start and nudge a tourist who sat nearby . " Who is that tragic man ? " she said . Russ sized up the Countess according to the standards he applied to all his victims . He saw that she was well-heeled , alone , and that she was n't averse to a taste of adventure . Russ ' plans for her , I suppose , included his usual itinerary for lively tourist ladies  --  fete-a-tete boating , a little dancing , mild flirtation , and a nostalgic good-by at the end of the fortnight . It 's almost certain that he had nothing more permanent in mind . The Countess was n't the Mummy type . Russ was instinctively leery of aggressive women . He was haunted by the dread that one of them would actually fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpowering creatures who would muss up his tidy exile by financing and sharing it . The Countess , however , was used to having her own way . Within two weeks , she broadcast herself in love . Her wooing took place under our eyes , yet neither my husband nor I worried about the outcome . We had seen too many ladies infatuated with the slippery Russ . The Countess , too , would eventually come to her tearful farewell scene , for she was n't the sort to put up with life in Puerto del Sol . Unlike the other ladies whom Russ had known , the Countess had no intention of reforming him . She fostered his fondness for gin and his ship-carving . They gave him character , she said . And Russ never dared call her Mummy . He was humble in her presence . Often there was an expression of simple wonder on his face , a kind of insurgent reappraisal of himself in a better light . I think he was touched that a woman like the Countess , " of a certain age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be so concerned about him . " It 's my last chance for a peaceful old age on Berkeley Square , " he would say to us when the Countess was n't around . " If I do n't take it , I 'm washed up . I 'll be an old rumdum sifting the garbage . " Neither of us believed Russ for a moment . But before we realized how far things had gone the Countess began referring to Russ as her fiance . One day she announced that the Captain was sick of his backwoods life and was returning to Paris with her . He was going , to work on his ship models in earnest ; she would arrange salon exhibitions . She set a date for the departure , and when my husband , sorry that we were losing our only touch of local color , mentioned the date to Russ , he shrugged . " it 's not in the cards , old chap . Not in the cards , " he said . The night before the scheduled departure day Russ came alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , accepting a cognac graciously and with his usual gesture of deference as if he were accepting the drink only for politeness ' sake . " When are you going ? " my husband asked . " Going ? " Russ appeared surprised . " I ca n't leave my models , old man . They have n't been sold yet , and I have n't a bean . " Oh ? " " l-ler ladyship is popping off . Back to London , you know . A matter of some stock-exchange negotiations . Then to Paris . " " Oh ? " " We shall perhaps meet in Capri . Christmas . I 'll fly over and back . A bit of a lark . " " Have you told the Countess ? " 1 asked . " Well , " he smiled wearily , " you know women . Must wait for the moment . " The next morning at ten when the taxi was to leave , my husband and . I found reasons to he at the Bella Vista . There sat the taxi in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing out tips . And , shockingly enough , tied to the top of the taxi were the four Spanish galleons . " For the exhibition , " said the Countess , interrupting for a moment her effusive good-bys . We wondered whether Russ had disappeared or whether he had brazened it out with her . Her face gave no hint . But suddenly , just as she turned to step into the taxi , she called out , " Tarle ton I " We had never known Russ ' first name , so her call did n't strike us as the knell it was . From the interior shadows of the hotel lobby , he emerged , cowed and quiet . He was wearing an impeccable flannel suit which the Countess must have purchased for him somewhere . His slim , pointed calf shoes were shiny as mirrors and a neat lawn handkerthief peeped from his breast pocket . Somehow he looked all wrong . He looked like a callow cousin of himself and made us feel sad and futile . My first urge  --  to laugh or deride him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russ nodded to us and stepped into the taxi . The Countess waved , dewy-eyed , as the taxi drove oft . Tied to the roof , the four full-bellied galleons tipped and swayed and threatened to fly off on their own . But they did n't . The Countess had secured them firmly . My husband and I looked at each other , and then , with the same thought , we turned to stare out over the quiet quay with the dirty water lapping its edges and the scrubby boats tied to its palings . Everything appeared drab . " He was n't really true after all , " 1 said . " Poor son of a bitch , " said my husband . " He just got scared , that 's all . He got the lonesome , middle-aged creeps , and she finished hint off . " We turned silently toward home , wondering , for the first time , just what would become of Russ . The second of two articles by IAN STEVENSON , M. D. SCHIZOPHRENIA : What we are finding out about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrible night of mental disorganization. " is a symptom , not a disease . . . a combination of both psychic and somatic factors . E HAVE no greater medical burden than schizophrenia . This disorder affects close to half a million persons in hospitals and perhaps live or ten times that many who remain at home . Yet these figures convey little of the magnitude of the problem . Consider , for example , the disorder 's usual long duration . A patient with pneumonia often returns to work within two months ; a particularly fortunate patient with schizophrenia may return to work in two years . Many patients remain ill until death releases them . Indeed , at one time the German psychiatrist Kraepelin , to whom we owc the first and still best descriptions of schizophrenia , believed that patients never recovered from it . If he happened to see a patient who had apparently recovered he changed his original diagnosis . We know that he was wrong in this , but his conviction exemplifies the gravity of the illness . Moreover , during all the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as can so many other chronically ill patients , such as those with diabetes or bronchial asthma . And even these statistics tell nothing of the terrible suffering of these persons whose sickness cuts them off from happy contact with other people . This severance of affectionate relations , as I shall show later , forms both a cause and a result of theillness . Yet , despite the enormous obstacles , we have slowly made progress against schizophrenia , and our efforts promise more for the future . This progress justifies a review of the present position and current directions of advance . The psychopathology of schizophrenia includes several abnormalities of which we can not clearly say which comes first and is therefore the most important . In full efflorescence , a disorganization of thoughts characterizes and dominates the patient 's mental life . To explain how this happens I need to say something first about normal thought processes . Ordinarily our thoughts /ink to each other through associations of similarity or contiguity . The associations of each person arise from his experiences and are as unique for him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over our thoughts which enables us to guide them toward the goals of our thinking . These two capacities for orderly association and for concentrated thinking we all possess in varying degrees , although some of us have greater powers than others . In sleep we all temporarily lose the glue which sticks our thoughts to each other , so that in our dreams incongruous ideas appear together . Usually these present themselves not as words , but as a succession of visual images . A story full of important meanings may unfold in a dream , but no verbal or abstract thought occurs . In ordinary waking life most thinking sustains a very low level of attention , and thoughts stream along without aiming at or reaching any goal . However , even the woolliest daydreamer preserves some capacity to direct his thoughts should the need arise . As I shall note later , however , the person who has slackened the tension of his thoughts by excessive daydreaming makes himself vulnerable to a total disorganization . Thoughts mediate our adjustment to the changing circumstances of our environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require a change of behavior . These stimuli signal the need for responses of varying quality and urgency . So the flow of thought becomes influenced by a hierarchy of present problems requiring solution , as well as by the associational pathways which previous experiences have established . When a particular problem has a high value it takes priority and temporarily excludes other thoughts from the field of consciousness . A person so occupied mentally may say then that he can not get something off his mind . The thoughts which attempt to solve such an , important problem carry with them strong feelings which we call emotions . Emotions in mild amounts impel us usefully toward constructive behavior . Fear warns us of danger and anger equips us to deal with it , at least in one way . But just as fever which combats infection may harm when it becomes excessive , so emotions , if too strong and too enduring , can bring disorder rather than adaptation . For all emotions influence the train of thoughts by tending to suck in other thoughts of the same quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries he had believed long since forgotten but which the present anger stirs into his awareness . An angry or a frightened person thus exhibits what we call emotional thinking . The thoughts run in a groove cut by the dominant emotion . They pre-empt the field of consciousness ; if other thoughts gain ascendancy for a moment , the more powerful emotional thoughts quickly obtrude again . As these continue they become less and less representative of the external situation , and since they misrepresent the environment they no longer provide accurate guides to action . Behavior ceases to adapt the person appropriately to the environment . Other persons become offended and act to protect their own interests , often aggressively . Their responses then augment the original fears . Thus far I have described nothing outside the experience of nearly everyone . Nearly everyone should therefore understand schizophrenia . For as Spinoza pointed out two hundred years ago a rage or a panic are temporary insanities . Fortunately most rages and panics subside within a few hours or days . And as they do the correspond-ing disorganization of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the patient we call schizophrenic , the disorganization of thought accompanying strong emotions becomes more marked and lasts longer . In fact , thoughts can become disorganized enough to bring severe abnormalities of perception ( hallucinations ) and evaluation ( delusions ) . HOW THE MIND SPLITS I N THE ordinary angry man the emotions seem quite out of line with the situation and with the man 's own thoughts . The emotions are seemingly inappropriate , like the flames which burst from green sticks on which someone has secretly poured gasoline . The same divergence of thoughts and emotions reaches a more extreme degree in schizophrenic reactions . The ordinary angry person notices that his angry thoughts crowd out other topics to which he would like to attend . They break into his ordinary train of association . In the schizophrenic patient this interruption progresses until the associations become so thoroughly loosened that the patient can not pursue any line of thought before another interrupts it . And the thoughts , perhaps because they change so rapidly , fail to carry their usual emotional tone . Thus the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinarily bring sorrow . The cardinal significance of this gap between thoughts and feelings led the Swiss psychiatrist Paul Eugen Bleuler to name the disorder schizophrenia , which means " split mind . " This quality alone makes the patient difficult to understand , for himself as well as others , But as his fear mounts and his thoughts become more disorganized , his ability to communicate falls off markedly . He may end by talking only allusively , telegraphically , and metaphorically . He uses a private symbolism and speaks only the literal , non-abstract language of dreams . ( The great English neurologist , Hughlings Jackson , told us in the last century that to understand insanity we should study dreams . ) These devices of altered communication partially protect the patient from further injury , but they also limit the help he can receive . In the end his speech may become as incomprehensible as Swahili or Bantu is to the ordinary man , although still full of meaning for him  --  and also for the psychotherapist who gets to know him . Worst of all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despaired of ever understanding or being understood helpfully .
