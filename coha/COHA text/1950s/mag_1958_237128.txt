The Salk vaccine against paralytic polio may be even more effective than the statistics have shown . Since wide-scale vaccination began in 1955 , there have been hundreds of reported cases of paralysis among people who had had one or two shots ( only a handful among those who had had three ) . But in last week 's A.M.A. Journal , a University of Pittsburgh team headed by Dr. William McD . Hammon <P> ( TIME , Nov. 3 , 1952 ) reported evidence that casts doubt on these figures . <P> Difficulty is that the poliomyelitis virus belongs to a family of at least three enteroviruses ( so called because they can multiply in the gut ) that sometimes cause no detectable illness , but at other times attack the nervous system . Doctors used to think that the only one of the three capable of causing paralysis was the virus of polio itself . This may not be so , say Hammon and colleagues . After studying six patients who were immunized against polio with gamma globulin in prevaccine days and then developed a paralytic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the guilty viruses were of the Coxsackie group ( named for the Hudson Valley town where the first one was isolated ) or the ECHO group ( named for enteric cytopathogenic human orphan ) . Concludes the A.M.A. : Viruses probably also have been responsible for some post-vaccination cases of paralysis , which therefore were not polio at all .
