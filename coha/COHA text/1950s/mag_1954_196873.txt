For a change , radio &; TV were talking loudly about something besides the sponsor 's product . The subject was the same one that engaged many another citizen : Senator Joe McCarthy . A few of radio &; TV 's pundits-notably Fulton Lewis Jr . and Walter Winchell-were loud in Mc Carthy 's defense . Some held a middle view , as did Bishop Fulton J. Sheen , who , by implication , praised Joe 's works while decrying his ways . The bishop 's parable : " It may very well be in any home that a man may set a rat trap with Gorgonzola cheese . . . Many in the home are dissatisfied with the Gorgonzola because it smells up the place . They should prefer to see Swiss cheese . . . put into the trap . But let no one confuse a process with a crime , and if the Gorgonzola is smelling up the house , then change the cheese , but , in God 's name , do not forget that the house has to get rid of its dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John Vandercook-took after McCarthy with verbal scalpels . <P> But the strongest voice was that of CBS 's Edward R. Murrow ( Person to Person and See It Now ) , who is something more than just another commentator on the news . Murrow decided that " this is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy 's methods to keep silent , " and began preparing his See It Now ( Tues. 10:30 p.m. , CBS ) program on the subject of McCarthy in action . When it went on the air , its impact was heightened by the course of events . While it was being prepared , McCarthy had successively locked in combat with the U.S. Army , Secretary Stevens , Adlai Stevenson , Senator Flanders and the White House . He had also fought a secondary action with the radio &; TV networks themselves over his right to reply to Stevenson . In this supercharged atmosphere , Murrow 's hard-hitting attack made a bang such as television had rarely registered . <P> Keeping his comment to a minimum , Murrow made his show largely from newsreel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee bench-a contrived but effective record of arrogance and assumed martyrdom , of half-stifled belches and heavy-handed humor . Radio &; TV men spent the next day congratulating each other that the networks had , for once , shaken off their habitual timidity . <P> Last week Murrow returned to the fray . After announcing that McCarthy had accepted a bid to appear on See It Now in his own defense on April 6 , Murrow devoted most of his show to a film report of the appearance of Annie Lee Moss before the McCarthy committee . It was nearly as devastating an indictment as the previous show , especially since it pictured McCarthy decamping from an unfavorable situation and leaving his harried counsel , Roy Cohn , to deal ineptly with the aroused Democratic members of the committee , who clearly felt that the accused witness was getting a raw deal ( TIME , March 22 ) .
