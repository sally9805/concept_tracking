As cartoonist for Lord Beaverbrook 's Tory London Evening Standard , David Low was often called the world 's best political cartoonist . Socialist Low throve on cartooning for a Tory paper , at times sharply caricatured both his boss , . the Beaver , and the Conservative government . Three years ago , Low moved his cartoons to a paper closer to his own political views . He switched from the Standard to the dull , doctrinaire Daily Herald , official organ of the Labor party . Instead of pepping up the Herald as he was supposed to do , the Herald-and the fact that Labor was in power-seemed to dull down Low . <P> The answer seemed to be that Low , like other cartoonists , is at his best when he is against something . Last week Low announced he would go to a job where he would feel more against things . Beginning Feb. i , he is moving over from the Daily Herald to the liberal ( but not Labor ) Manchester Guardian . Explained Low : " I have no quarrels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I just feel it will be a relief ... to go back to a public more appreciative of the fine points , and one should move along every few years . "
