L the whole complex business of putting together a big modern television show , probably no one person has a more demanding , yet less widely appreciated job than the head writer . To begin with , it is he who lays out  --  or " routines " ? the sequence of dialogue , songs , specialty acts and commercials on the program . In addition to this , he must be a master gag writer himself and must he capable of guiding a staff of assistant jokcsmiths through the intricacies of styling their material to the personalities of the star and guest stars . Perhaps most important of all , it is up to him to persuade the actors who have to tell the jokes that these arc really very funny jokes indeed and are sure to get big laughs . Thus , a head writer must possess the combined talents of an editor , a gag writer and a diplomat . It is very difficult to find such a combination of traits in a single individual , and there are probably no more than twenty skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 443:01 ) a week . At the top of his profession  --  with to week  --  is a gentleman named Goodman Ace , who head-writes the Perry Como television show . As a good deal of the Como show consists of songs by Como or guest singers , the actual dialogue does not average more than 2500 words per week , and a lot of people think that Ace has the softest touch in television . At times , Ace gets upset about being regarded as a sort of literary swindler . He recently remarked , " I 'm introduced to somebody at a party and they say , ' What do you do for a living , Mr. Goodman ? ' ? by the way , I 'm always being called Goodman by strangers . So I say , ? I write the Perry Como show . ' So they look at me suspiciously and say , But what do you do ? How much time could it take to write that program ? ' The trouble is we work like dogs to make the Como show look free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in front of the cameras and said anything that came into their heads . You think it 's easy to write simple , tight dialogue without obvious jokes or heavy slapstick ? Perry does not like big jokes on the program . He cuts them out usually . " Ace wishes that he could write for Como the kind of jokes he used to write for Milton Berle . Ace was Milton Berle 's head writer from Lorg ! to ! Drift . He created an eerie little female character , named Maxie , who was Berle 's secretary and was passionately in love with him . It was Maxie who once told about a boy friend 's taking her to the Louvre and showing her the statue of the Venus de Milo . " I said , " said Maxie , " that t wished I looked like that  --  and he started breaking off both my arms . " In defending his creative labors , Ace points out that , for one thing , people do n't realize that even the nonspeaking jokes on the program are invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ace racked his brains fora week trying to concoct a hilarious three-anda-half-minute sketch between Como and Douglas . Then he had a flash of inspiration . He remembered that Douglas still had the heard he had grown for the role of Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life . He telephoned Douglas in Beverly Hills and told him to leave the beard on . Then he arranged for Perry Como , an ex-barber from Canonsburg , Pennsylvania , to give Douglas a haircut and shave right on television . It may not have been high comedy , but it was plenty funny , and what was funny was the idea . not the words ( Continued on Page 138 ) On the question of words , Ace goes along is ith Pascal , the French philosopher . who said he was writing a friend a king letter because he did n't have the time to write a short Idler . The more compact the dialogue , the more difficult it is to compose . Ace likes to cite an experience he had while head-writing The Rig Show , on NBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the guest . Ace had no trouble writing a straight speech for Tallulah . It went : " George . I envy you . You have so many talents . You arc a movie actor , a stage actor ; you sing , you play the piano and you compose music ; you paint ; I understand you own a factory which turns out lamp shades that you design . and I 've just heard you 've invented a camera which the Army is considering buying . How do you do all these things ? " Now a comical answer by Sanders was required . Ace and four other writers beat out their brains all day long in a vain effort to come up with a good joke . That night , while Ace was showenng , mot Piste came to him . When Tallulah said , " How do you do all these things ? " Sanders would suavely reply , " Superbly ! " It was only one word , but it was the perfect word  --  amusing and in character . Yet it took about ten hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing in a two-room office at 38 East 57th Street . To a superficial observer it might seem that Ace and his colleagues arc just killing time all day long in the office . Mrs. Ace told me . " I do n't see how they really get any work done there . All they do is play gin rummy , eat sandwiches , drink coffee and argue about baseball , " There is only one desk and one typewriter . Ace always occupies the desk and mans the typewriter . Jay Burton , George Foster and Mort Green , the other Como writers , lounge around on the leather sofa or chairs . There arc no volumes of old jokes or indexed files crammed with buns snots . Acc says , " In the time it takes to look up an old joke in a gag tile and then switch it to tit Perry Como , 1 can make up use new jokes . " The four writers just sit around and talk , and whenever anybody says anything funny , Ace types it out . For instance last June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Sid Caesar program had been canceled by NBC . This gave Ace an idea for an opening . I watched the four gag writers at work . ACE ( peering owlishly through thick , green-runnrcif spectacles ) : Let 's write the opening spot , fellas . I think we should open with Ed Wynn . Fosti 14 : Why should we open with Ed Wynn ? Act : I got an idea . 4Ln:tonne u cigar . ) Wynn comes in wearing a toga and he 's got sandals on , see ? He 's got like a wreath on his head . You get the picture ? BURTON : Yeah . AC1 : Well , he tells Perry he wants to do a scene from Shakespeare . He starts out with " Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend me your ears . " And Como tells him he ca n't do it . I le says Shakespeare is out . He cuts him right off . And then Wynn says , " It seems like Caesar ca n't get anywhere on this network . " GKIIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be funnier if we have Wynn say , " Friends , Romans , patsanos ? " Act Iptillttag on cigar ) : The joke would be too obvious . Fostiat : I do n't think it 's Julius Caesar who says that friends , Romans , countrymen bit . I think it 's Mark Antony . BURTON ( finishing u turkey sandwich with Russian dre.ssing ) : So who 'll know the difference ? The discussion over the opening spot raged for about three hours , and finally the spot was finished . At rehearsal , however , it was cut out because the program was running too long . The Rockefeller of writers is a slender fellow with a world-weary face and a sharp crew-cut , " I am , " he informed mc , " live foot twelve inches tall . I have blue eyes with twenty-twenty vision . I can sec twenty inches in front of me at all times . I weigh a hundred and seventy-five pounds , mostly in the stomach . My name is really Ace . My father 's name was Ace . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both girls . I was born in Kansas City , Missouri , on January 15 , 1899 . Like Harry Truman , my father was a Kansas City haberdasher . I have a lot of trouble getting into the Stork Club , It 's not that I 'm barred from the Stork Club . I just ca n't get in . This is depressing to my ego . " The trouble is , Ace just does not look like a celebrity or even a rich head writer . Once , after he and his wife had been unable to get past the rope at the Stork Club . Ace complained to columnist Leonard Lyons . Lyons reported the indignity to owner Sherman Billingsley . Billingsley sent Acc four red bow ties as a peace offering and a now " When the dinner bell rings , come to the Stork Club . We think we have the best air-conditioned room in town and you 're always welcome here . " Ace replied : " Dear S. B .. I know you have the best air-conditioned room in town because I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other night . " Another time , Ace had a luncheon appointment with Jack Benny at a leading Ncw York restaurant . Ace says , " I did n't want to meet Jack there because I was sure I would n't be able to get in , but Jack promised he would meet me outside the door . Well . I got over there , but Jack Was n't outside , and as I walk in , there 's this guy with the round haircut who greets you there , if you can call it greeting , and he looks at me like I 'm collecting gar ? bage , and he says , ' What can I do for you ? ' and I say , ' I 'd like to sec a suit of clothes , ' and he says , ' What do you mean by that remark ? ' and I say , ' Well , what would l be coming in here for anyhow ? This is a public restaurant , is n't it ? You sell food here , do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But perhaps the best illustration of Ace 's inability to cope successfully with restaurant situations is the Case of the Scrambled Eggs . This unfolded at a show . business rendezvous to which the Acts had repaired for supper one night . Mrs. Ace ordered scrambled eggs . When they arrived , she said , " These eggs do n't look good to me . " Ace politely requested the wailer to take the eggs back to the kitchen and bring a new order of eggs . " Why ? " asked the waiter . Acc murmured , " My wife says these eggs do n't look so good . " " Yeah ? " the waiter snarled . " The eggs look better than you do . " Mrs. Ace started storming at the waiter but her husband interrupted her . " Now , Jane , " he said , " maybe he 's right . I really have n't been looking so good lately . " Ace is always convinced that he is coming down with one disease or another . He told me , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Years  --  and Still Am . " Among Ace 's symptoms are heart palpitations , choking , loss of breath and stabbing pains in the chest and stomach . The attacks may come at any timee . When he goes to the theater , he gets SAO on the aisle so ( Continued on Page 140 ) // ( Continued from l'oge IA he can make a fast getaway . Nor is his luck any better at Yankee Stadium , where I he Aces have long had a season box . Irving Mansfield , television producer and a former friend of Ace 's , says , " 1 used to go to the stadium with Goody all the time . By the third or fourth inning , he would get one of his so-called heart attacks and we all had to get up and go . I slopped going with him because I never saw the end of a ball game . " Ace loves horse racing as much as baseball , " When we used to do Easy Aces on radio . " Mrs. Ace told me , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday  --  and we went to the track the other three days , in between . On Sundays we read the Sunday papers . We 'd even travel out to Pimlico or Arlington Park just for the day , if the horses were running there . We always rented a house right next to the track during the Saratoga season . " It was Ace who once quipped , " The warm-weather months arc May , June , July and Saratoga . " An incurable gambler , he has lost tens of thousands of dollars on the horses . He once remarked , " I have the horses just where they want me . " Discussing a long shot on which he had risked 5500 , he sadly observed . " I got a tip this horse would walk in . I must say the horse tried it , " Ace goes through life with a wildly offbeat attitude toward everything around him . If someone greets him with the cliche " What 's new ? " Ace replies seriously , " The Sammy Kayes have their friends worried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure he has heard correctly . " And restaurateur Frank Mancuso and songstress Martha Wright know it 's spring . " At this , utterly baffled , the person usually goes away quickly . Many years ago , Ace read the abase items in Walter Winchell 's column , memorized them and has been quoting them ever since . The only person who Ace will concede is more lunatic in his daily living than himself is Groucho Marx , a great and good friend of the master head writer . Once , Ace was a house guest at Groucho 's Beverly Hills estate . The first morning Ace came down for breakfast there was a small glass of fresh orange juice at his place , Ace drank the juice . He then asked for a second glass of juice . " Hold on there ! " Groucho cried , glaring . " Oranges do n't grow on trees , you know ! " Ace 's eccentricities include a somewhat whimsical attitude toward money . Recently , an automobile firm offered him 57500 to write a sixty-minute script for a musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . They raised the ante to $10,000 and then 515,000 . He kept saying " No . " Finally his agent , lien Gricfer , of the William Morris office , telephoned in great excitement . " They 've raised their offer again , " he said . " I 'm not interested , " Ace said . " Hut they 're now offering you twenty thousand  --  and an automobile ! " " Well , Ben , you just tell them I have each of those , " Ace replied crisp 's .. And he does too . He has , in fact , a limousine and a chauffeur . Despite these adjuncts to gracious motoring , however , the Aces seldom journey far from their home in the Ritz Tosser , on 57th Street . When I asked him how he was spending the summer , he replied , " Oh , we go north  --  to Yankees . Stadium . " They no longer go to far-distant tracks , If the horses are n't running at Belmont , Aqueduct or Monmouth Park , Ace bets with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . From the time he started making big money , back in 1933 , he has invested most of his earnings in common stocks . Some of his friends say he has over a million dollars . Ace would not confirm this , but a gag writer who has worked under him remarks , " Before money was even invented , Goody Ace already had eight dollars in the bank , " Yet he is an exceedingly generous man , always buying gifts for his friends and even casual acquaintances , and never allowing anybody to pick up a restaurant check . He wanted to buy me a custom-made 5250 suit when I accompanied him to his tailor 's one afternoon . When I explained that it would be unethical of to accept his gift , he seemed genuinely puzzled . After all , he pointed out , the fact that television pays him rather handsomely does n't prevent him from speaking his mind about the industry . " I like everything about television but the programs . " he once said . " Television is home movies  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recently he gave a front-page interview to the New York World-Telegram in which he lashed out at the lack of creative danng in television . " Television is mired in the muck of mediocrity , " was his alliterative summation of the situation . In 1946 , he was appointed Supervisor of Comedy Programs for CBS and given a big office on the eighteenth floor . 1 only took the job because I needed office space , " he cracked . He was to be in charge of developing new radio programs . Each day he suggested ideas , but he never got any action . Among his ideas was a quiz program with Groucho Marx as quizmaster . He was told it was impractical . One day during a conference , he said , " If an atom bomb ever fell on New York , the safest place would be on the eighteenth floor of CBS . " " Why ? " he was asked . " Because there 's no radioactivity up here . " The morning after the premiere of a new situation comedy , an executive vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of the new show . l 'm putting my secretary on . Give her your honest opinion . " Ace snarled , " If it 's my honest opinion you want , you 'd better put a man on the phone . " Ace feels an equally strong contempt for television critics . " They 're always criticizing in great detail some play that was given on Kraft Theatre or Studio One , " he says . " What they 're really saying is , Do n't watch the show that was on last night . " Jack Gould , the New York Times cntic , once remarked of Ace 's jokes on The Big Show , " The comedy is predictable . " Acc invited him to come over to his office . " I told hint he could save us seven days of hard work if he would predict the comedy we were going to write for the following week . He did n't show up . " In 1955 , Simon &; Schuster published a collection of Ace 's vitriolic essays on radio and television . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted pippin ( " If you 're such a good writer , Why do n't you write a book ? " ) this book could have been more possible . April 19. 1958 The jacket blurb  --  written by 0 . Ace , of course  --  says : The Book of Little Knowledge is Goodman Ace 's second hook . His first , compiled after some twenty-odd years writing and acting in a radio program known as Easy Aces , was , ta bankbook , published by Central Hanover , 60th Street brunch , New York City . " The Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company  --  now The Hanover Bank  --  has received several inquiries from persons wanting to know what year it published the Goodman Ace Bankbook and whether it is still in print . This sardonic approach to life has been a part of Ace as far back as he can recall . " I remember as a boy , " he recalls , " sitting on the fire escape of our apartment and looking out at Kansas City  --  we lived on the north side  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrace , with its rail , and it 's just an overgrown fire escape , and I look out at New York and I still feel unhappy about life . I wonder what the whole point of everything is . " At Kansas City Junior College he wrote a cynical column for the paper , called , typically enough , The Dyspeptic . His bitterness became sharpened when in 1919 , at the tender age of twenty , he became drama , movie and vaudeville critic of the Kansas City Post . The first show he reviewed was Come Along , advertised as a lavish and beautiful musical extravaganza . Ace started his critique : " Come Along is certainly an expensive and lavish production . The settings were beautiful  --  both of them . " The next morning , the producer of Come Along stormed into the office and demanded : a retraction . Instead , Harry Tammen , co-publisher of the Post , gave Ace a five-dollar raise . Reviewing a comedian named Harry Fox , Ace wrote : " You ca n't hear him past the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row when you go to see the new bill at the Empress . " In 1929 , he reviewed Milton Berle , who was doing a single at the RKO on Main Street . " Milton Berle , " wrote Ace , " a young comedian with old jokes . held down the next-to-closing position . It was Mr. Berle who said , ' A funny thing happened on my way to the theater ? ' but if it did , it did n't happen on the stage . It must cost a lot of money for material , so here come some newics for Mr. Berle which he can have free of charge . " Then there followed an entire column of original jokes . Twenty-five years later , during a script conference , Berle suddenly stood up , whistled for attention and took out the tattered clipping from the Kansas City Post . " Goody , " he said , " I think we can use some of these jokes right now , " During the ' 20 's Ace 's reviews began to earn him a reputation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as master of ceremonies at the Palace on Broadway , wired Acc for an opening joke . Ace looked up the advance Palace bill in Variety and saw that the opening act was Long Tack Sam , a Chinese magician . He wired Jack Benny the joke which he used . After Long Tack Sam 's exit , Benny came on and drawled , " Vaudeville has certainly changed . I can remember when it took Japs or better to open . " Benny sent Ace a check for fifty dollars for the one-liner . Since this was as much as Ace was making in a whole week at the newspaper , he began thinking there was a real future in joke writing , but he , lacked enough confidence to cut loose from a steady job and seek his fortune on Broadway . In 1928 , he got on the radio , reading the comics over Station KMBC on Sun day morning . He got ten dollars a broadcast . Ile had just got married to Jane Epstein , a local beauty whom he had been courting for ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started a nightly lifteen-minute program over K MBC , Where 's u Good Show ? One night the program following Ace , a network show from New York , did not get through , and Ace was asked to ad-lib another fifteen minutes . Mrs. Acc happened to be waiting for her husband in the studio . Ace pulled her to the mike and said , " I 'd like you to meet my roommate , She 's a marvelous bridge player .... Are n't you , honey ? How would you like to shoot a game of auction bridge tonight ? " This last line got screams in Kansas City because two days earlier a society woman had shot her husband during a quarrel over his bridge technique . " It was too had about that man , " continued Ace . " The funeral is tomorrow , He 's going to be buried with simple honors . " That was the beginning of Easy Aces  --  a program which lasted un radio seventeen years . It brought Goodman Ace 141 from Kansas City In Chicago to Ncw York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years Easy Aces centered around the bridge table , with Ace playing a sardonic , long-suffering husband , and Jane , an exuberant , ungrammatical and lovable wife . Mrs. Ace played the " cumbersome " system of bridge . Her malapropisms were quoted everywhere : " We 're insufferable friends . " " Familiarity breeds attempt . " " I work my head to the bone . " Ace produced , wrote and directed every show . After 1931 , Easy Aces progressed from bridge problems to T II E SATURDAY EVENIND 1 ' 011 other dilemmas of married life , such as love , inlidelits. money , budgets and relatives , Ace pioneered the husband-aridwife family-siimilion comedy formula , which became baste in radio comedy and is still popular in toles twit . " The reason for the success of this formula , " dead-pans Ace , - Is that it this unisersal appeal because every Amenean home has at least OM family . " In le45 Ace decided to insert musical bridges from one scene to the nest . The sponsor , Anacin , told him to cut nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uaggish letter , " I do n't like the new cardboard buses of AI1.1011 . I like the tin better . Cut out the cardboard . " Ace says , " It took them four weeks to think up IL clever answer to my letter . It was ' You 're tired ! " ' And so it happened that , at the age of forty-six , Ace became a head wrier , at 53500 weekly , for the Danny ISaye program . After twenty-six weeks , Kaye moved the program to Hollywood . Ace resigned . " I had heard . " he explains . " that it was three hours earlier out there , and I did n't want to get up three hours earlier . " The virtuoso head writer states that his biggest problems with comedy performers are I I I their insatiable craving to get all the laughs and 12 ) their morbid fear of trying a new approach or trying jokes which arc original . On the first script he wrote for Tallulah Bankhead , she objected because guest star Ethel Merman had 50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In radio , Tallulah , " Ace explained patiently . " the star does not have all the jokes . Jack Benny does not have all the jokes on his program . " " But if Ethel sings all the songs , should have all the jokes , " La Hankhead replied , " We solved that one , " Ace recalls , " by letting Tallulah sing songs like Bye Bye Blackbird . even though she has a ' voice like the mating call of a crow . " Besides wanting all the laughs , comedians also resist novelty , Ace claims . Yea novelty  --  either of form or of content  --  a absolutely essential for a television comedian , because constant weekly exposure begins to bore the audience . Ace fah that comedians like Berle and Jackie Gleason would still be on television if they were not so stubborn about changing . " I had two experiences that point this up , " Ace says . " When Joan Davis guested with Tallulah , sse wrote her what we thought was a smart , sophisticated monologue . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' You have n't cap . tured the real me , ' she said . I got real nasty and said , ' Who wants the real yo0. ? I 'm giving you a better script than you ever had before . ' So she says , ' But there arc no soggy-bread jokes in the script : This was a new one on me . I said , ' What 's that ? ' ' Well , ' she says , ' it 's a joke , like I say I just came over on the Lusitania , and the straight line is , " But the Lusitania went down thirty-five years ago , " and I say . " No wonder the bread was so soggy ! " See , jokes like that . ' I told her if she wanted to be on The Big Show she would have to be satisfied with dry-bread jokes . " Then we have comedians  --  and I 've written for all of them  --  who , when you give them a joke , also want you to gist them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use in case the ongmal joke does n't get a laugh . It might be a line like , know you 're out there  --  I can hear you breathing . ' I once wrote for one comedian who was so neurotic he wanted a protection line for the protection line  --  in case the first protection line did n't get a laugh . " I started writing for Berk in 1952 and it was my first experience in television . He read the first script and said , ' This is n't lappy enough . You 've got to make it lappy . ' Well , I had heard the phrase ' lap dissolve ' used in motion picture and I figured ' hippy ' was some kind of television-cutting technique , but 1 found out that Berle meant ' lay it in their laps : A lappy joke is a sure-fire joke . So any time we came up with a joke that was different , offbeat , satiric , Berle would say at was n't kppy enough . I finally decided that I was n't lapisy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry Como , a man of infinite . amiability and happy-go-lucky casualness . Ace has no problems of either egomania or joke anxiety . Como calls Ace " the gray one " and regards him as some strange , not-quite-human species . Ace finds the torpid baritone a real pleasure to work with , " Como , " he says , " will actually cut out a page of his own jokes so he can give Vaughn Monroe , say , time to sing an extra song . He does n't worry whether the joke arc happy or soggy . Some people even think he has a good sense of comedy delisery . Not long ago , Jack Benny telephoned me from the Coast and said , ' Como is a good comic . He 's got a good sense of timing. ? And Ace , a man who can not resist a sarcastic statement esen when he is speaking of somebody he likes , replied ..
