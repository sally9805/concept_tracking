Everyone knows of India 's Jawaharlal Nehru and of Madame Pandit , his handsome sister . Few know , however , of " the other Nehru sister , " comely Krishna Nehru Hutheesing , who is 17 years younger than Jawaharlal , seven years younger than Madame Pandit . In the January Ladies ' Home Journal , Mrs. Hutheesing has produced a charming portrait of herself and her distinguished family . But she is also clear-eyed about what power has done to her brother . <P> " I have always adored Jawahar , " she writes . But " thirty years of struggle and sacrifice have left their mark . Each year has taken away something of the warmth , gaiety and outgoing charm . . . The brown eyes that were ever ready to sparkle at some witty sally often hold an expression now of hard defiance or weary frustration . His face is that of a tired man who seems to be driven by some internal force which never relents , never lets go . His smile today is the smile of a self-possessed man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defying any criticism . . . <P> " How un-Indian the greatest Indian leader and first Prime Minister is , " reflects his sister , telling of his upbringing amid a wealthy family that sent to England for its clothes ( Nehru wore European suits until his micros ) ; of Nehru 's longstanding passion for chocolate cake , pies and ice-cream sundaes ; and of his continuing preference for English friends ( like Lord and Lady Mountbatten ) . " It was Gandhi who once jokingly said , ' When Jawahar talks in his sleep , he speaks in English . ' " <P> Anonymous Confession . Mrs. Hutheesing quotes revealingly from an article Nehru wrote anonymously about himself in 1937 . Disguising himself in the third person . Nehru wrote : " The most effective pose is one in which there seems to be the least of posing , and Jawahar had learned well to act without the paint and powder of an actor . . . What is behind that mask of his ? . . . what will to power ? . . . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or great injury . . . Men like <P> Jawahar , with all their capacity for great and good work , are unsafe in a democracy .
