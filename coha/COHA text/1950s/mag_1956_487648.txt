FOR A TIME this autumn , college football seemed to be caught in one of the waves of public morality which have been advancing for a decade or so . It is hard to argue with a good , loud vow to be pure , but carried into college football this sort of thing could have been tragic , at least to those of us who like football skillful , fast and exciting . Drive out the tramp athletes , as a California athletic official promised in September , or stop recruiting farmhands , as a Midwestern educator pledged in October , and what have you got left to play football ? ROGER KAHN is sports editor of Newsweek and a free-lance writer . You 've got students , that 's what , and once you 've seen one student play , you 've seen them all . Fortunately for us spectators , by now it has become clear as a golden autumn afternoon that the colleges did not intend to drive the halfbacks out of their admission offices , after all . They were only pretending out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan . For after such phrases as " dual morality must be eliminated " echoed into silence early in the season , students once again were confined to classrooms and the distinction between football players at ambitious colleges and the professionals in the National Football League remained small : the collegeplayers would never accept checks . Occasionally someone suggests that it is not proper to be flippant with a problem which has moved half the big colleges in America to cheat , connive and break rules . Occasionally someone suggests that there is nothing wrong with subsidizing college athletes . Well , it seems to me that there is a great deal wrong with paying muscular " C " students to go to college , and as for flippancy  --  the idea of a college president rounding up prospects as eagerly as a boxing promoter is as flip as anything that comes to mind . ' From a great professional football player out of Texas comes a story , only slightly atypical , which shows anti ' thew ? recruiters ? ? re , pre-sally willing to go . Several scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the oil country of Texas , the pro star reports , and the best they saw was the son of a man who owns A few dozen wells . They made an introductory offer of room , board , books , tuition and $40 a month expenses , but the boy laughed them off . " My daddy can afford to send me to college , " the boy said , " and he wants me to go to Texas . " " Can you think of something you 'd really like to have ? " one of the scouts asked . " Nope , " the boy said , gesturing shyly toward six derricks in the dis-tatick , ** , " Say , " the second scout said in a flash of inspiration . " You got any teal close friends on your high-school team ? " " Sure , " the boy said . " My two best buddies . " " Tell you what , " the scout said . " You come on up to play at Okla-home and we 'll give your two buddies scholarships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you say ? " Ultimately , this boy said no , but Oklahoma scouts usually , hear yes , which in part explains why the Oklahoma football team has not been defeated in four years . COLLEGES first branched into the sideline of professional football during the 1920s and the reason put forth most often concerns mortgages . After World War I , it appears , countless colleges erected stadiums as memorials without fully realizing what they were getting into . Long after the last eulogy had been delivered , there remained sizeable bank notes to be paid . Track , soccer and girl 's field hockey drew few spectators to the expensive stadiums , but football meant cash customers . Since good football teams drew more fans and more money than ordinary ones , it was only a question of time before the colleges were doing all they could to attract the best football players alive . Meanwhile , universities which had neglected to build memorial stadiums gazed in wonder at football construction - at ? the-first. thaw . Ever since , colleges have not attempted to stop attracting good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would make such a policy gibe with a philosophy of education . With potential income running over a million dollars a year for a good team , competition has been rough . Some schools , such as N.Y.U. and Fordham , which tried and failed to compete at a reasonable profit , have dropped football altogether . Others , such as Notre Dame , succeeded at the cost of developing a Hamlet 's Mother Complex . Invariably , they protest too much ; ask an innocent question about the way a Notre Dame fullback runs and you are told immediately what a whiz he is at organic chemistry . VIRTUALLY every college currently involved in football is a member of a sprawling supervisory organization called the National Collegiate Athletic Association , which successfully worked out the limited television contract that is in operation but has : been less successful in policing its recruiting " sanity code . " Actually , the teams in the NCAA fall into more specific categories and each has been sotnewhat ' different In ite reaction to the morality waye . The Ivy League : These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their football players are literate , this year banded into a formal league after fifty years of consistent but informal competition . Yale , beaten only by Colgate , a non-league member , won the championship rather handily . All the Ivies have agreed to prohibit athletic scholarships and in practice good athletes get only a slightly disproportionate number of their academic grants . Harvard , Princeton and the rest do not have to make lavish offers . Bright high school athletes seldom miss the significance of an Ivy League diploma , and the point is stressed by many alumni who offer post-graduate jobs as lure . The caliber of football is only fair , but the Ivies are a happy , stuffy world unto themselves . The Big Ten : Over the last twenty years , this group of large Midwestern colleges has played the best football in the country . Concerned about recruiting getting so far out of hand that two decades of sharp practice might come to light , the Big Ten investigated itself for most of this year . In October the investigating committee reported a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs depend on winning , constantly evaded the rules on recruiting and financial aid to athletes . But , the committee conceded , the rules were not as clear as they should be . Aid , for example , is to be based on need and , citing " need , " Michigan was giving $560 a year for pocket money out of a scholarship fund to a star end who was a " C-minus " student . 2 . One school spent $13,600 to entertain football prospects last year . This year at least 500 prospective student athletes will visit each Big Ten school at the school 's expense . 3 . " Make-work " jobs have increased four-fold in ten years  --  and there were quite a few around ten years ago . 4 . Despite a rule that athletic departments must file statements on financial aid to athletes , one college rite Kama had no statement in the file for the past five years . Good Big Ten athletes have gotten room , board , books , tuition , tickets and subsistence . The report is an admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , board , etc . The South and Southwest : Whether these teams are grouped in leagues is meaningless because their league rules are so loose Traditionally , anything the NCAA ca n't prove goes . Notre Dame : This school 's poorest season since 1933 was only a terrible accident . Notre Dame will de-emphasize its football about the same time the New York Yankees decide to de-emphasize baseball . Athletes at Notre Dame must maintain a 77 average , but getting first crack at nearly every Roman Catholic high school in the country , Notre Dame has little trouble finding recruits who are bright as well as strong . The Pacific Coast Conference : Here morality hit home hardest . For a while , in fact , Governor Goodwin Knight was urging the California schools to form their own private league . Practices similar to those of the Big Ten flourished here , but somewhat more openly and somewhat less smoothly . Colleges swiped athletes from one another , jealousies grew fierce and last year the schools eagerly began to blow whistles on each other . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference and an ambitious , serious lawyer , found himself hip-deep in evidence embarrassing to everybody . When Schmidt tried to investigate the athletic programs of U.C.L.A. and Washington at first hand , the two colleges refused to hold still . He then banned U.C.L.A. from the Rose Bowl for three years and Washington for two , moves that could cost each university almost $100,000 . When he turned on California and Southern California , both admitted over-active recruiting . He fined California $25,000 and banned U.S.C. from the Ro'se Bowl for three years , in addition to fining that school $10,000 . Already there is talk in coast athletic circles that Schmidt wants to become a governor . " He 'll get tired , of playing cop , " a friend from U.S.C. has been telling me bitterly . More than twenty-five years ago , John Kieran proposed a sotution to college football 's numerous emphasis problems . " Stop charging admission , " Kieran urged . It is significant that in the last twenty-five years both prices and emphasis have been stepped up . I 'm not a destructionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see no end to large-scale commercial college football . Pending that development , I intend to go on enjoying the gardes  --  without bothering to find out whether the ' quarterback is driving a Cadillac or a bicycle . I do n't approve of intercollegiate hypocrisy , but it is senseless to begrudge the quarterback his living .
