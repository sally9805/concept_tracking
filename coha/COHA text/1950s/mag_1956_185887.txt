MIRAGE ( 726 pp. ) - Ruth McKenney - Farrar , Straus &; Cudahy ( $4.95 ) . <P> <P> This huge historical novel gives the impression of having been written by two different authors-one whose job it was to put plenty of sex on every other page ; the other a Francophile intent on cramming in as much esoteric knowledge as possible about Napoleon , Egypt , archaeology , physics , intrigue and strategy . Fortunately , both writers are combined in Humorist Ruth ( My Sister Eileen ) McKenney , so that sex is more often ridiculous than salacious , and the historical asides often get a witty assist over the dusty pit of pedantry . <P> During the French Revolution , Rmi Saint-Victor and the Marquise Corinne de Theuriet narrowly missed appointments with the guillotine . Now , after four years ' imprisonment , Remi is back at the Polytechnic Institute where he had been Lavoisier 's prize pupil ; the marquise is the wife of complaisant General Rouvroy and the mistress of scoundrelly Jardinier , a British spy , black-marketeer and confidant of the great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Josephine , the eyes of Rmi and Corinne meet across a crowded room : " He saw her catch her breath . The chocolate dropped from her fingers . Her hand went to the base of her lovely white throat ; her brilliant eyes burned , a promise to Rmi , a beckoning . He bowed , smiling . " Within ten pages they are busily engaged in rumpling the sofa of Rmi 's bachelor flat while Jardinier is bound for Amsterdam in his carriage with only a Russian Grand Duchess to tousle . <P> <P> These boudoir conquests are succeeded by Napoleon 's conquest of Egypt . ( Rmi is one of a corps of French savants whom Napoleon takes along to bring civilization to the benighted Arabs . ) Author McKenney handles battles with as much relish as bundling . The rout of the Mamelukes at the Pyramids is closely followed by the annihilation of the French fleet at Aboukir Bay , and Napoleon and his army of 25,000 settle down for their strange three-year sojourn in Egypt . The impact of the French Age of Enlightenment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her best pages . <P> Rmi takes an Egyptian child bride as a favor to Napoleon , who dreams of founding a new dynasty and a new race in the Middle East . But the French are halted at Acre , plague decimates their ranks , the fellahin reject Enlightenment for the savage joys of Holy War against the Christian dogs . Napoleon is defeated by fate , and Rmi by Corinne . Author McKenney , who has spent nearly four years in writing Mirage , tells her complicated story in an elliptic , literary shorthand that conveys much information quickly but will be the despair of some readers . Nearly every page is scattered with the confetti of French , Latin and Italian phrases , and , occasionally , the dialogue is so polished as to remain forever obscure . Still , the world she describes , if not the authentic 18th century , is nevertheless an authentic world of the imagination . Her Paris is as gay as a dream of Paris , her Egypt as eerily strange as all lands that lie below the horizon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own-more life , in fact , than they are likely to have in the three-hour movie that will certainly be made from Mirage.
