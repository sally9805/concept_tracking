The lady in the picture had good looks and a title : Lady Georgiana Gordon . Moreover , she was by the respected hand of 18th Century British Portraitist John Hoppner . But she was in poor condition , her complexion sallowed by a thick coat of yellow varnish . When the Brooklyn Museum got her as a gift in 1934 , officials dismissed Lady Georgiana as an inferior Hoppner , sent her to the basement . Recently , Brooklyn assigned Restorer Sheldon Keck to give her a thorough face lifting . <P> Keck gave the portrait a good going-over with a magnifying glass , then with X-ray photographs . Sure enough , under the pretty features lay another shadowy face . For three months , Keck worked painstakingly with a solvent mixture , cotton swabs and a delicate scalpel , removed the varnish and the top layer of paint . As he worked , a totally different young lady appeared . Writes Keck in the current museum Bulletin : " The mouth was wider and less luscious ; the nose was longer and definitely hooked . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid . The entire shape of the face was subtly different and more mouselike , receding especially at the chin . " <P> Who had given the mousy lady her later look ? Most probably , says Keck , some unknown craftsman of 50 years ago or so who wanted to pretty her up for prospective buyers . In reworking the face , the painter might even have tried for a faithful likeness of Lady Georgiana Gordon : the top picture bore some resemblance to a contemporary drawing of her . But who was the restored lady ? Brooklyn has n't solved that problem yet . <P> Stripped of her glamour and pedigree , however , the plain-faced miss struck museum officials as an all-round better piece of art . Last week she was upstairs , entitled simply A Lady . <P> George Washington also turned up in the art news again-this time as a rather foxy-faced gentleman in a braided blue jacket . A picture portraying him in such fashion , long mistitled A Naval Officer , now hangs in Sulgrave Manor , ancestral Northamptonshire home of the Washington family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on commission from Washington 's distant kinsman , the eleventh Earl of Buchan . The earl 's fancy : to have a picture of his revolutionary relation as first President of the U.S. Supposedly mislaid , the picture was found hanging in the hall of the 15th earl in 1939 , identified as Robertson 's Washington . Last May , the earl sent it off to Sulgrave Manor ( since 1914 a Washington shrine ) . Not especially publicity conscious , Sulgrave Manor just got around to announcing the acquisition last week .
