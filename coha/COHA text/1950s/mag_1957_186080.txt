Kickacks <P> Although Supreme Court rulings , i.e. , the ban on bus segregation in Montgomery , Ala. , have made " every segregation act or law of any state as dead as a doornail , " declared U.S. District Judge Dozier DeVane in Tallahassee , Fla. last week , " every state has a right to litigate these matters . " <P> Judge DeVane , at that moment , was about as deep in litigation as he could get . Three days before , Tallahassee Negroes broke their own seven-month bus boycott and began a concerted ride-the-bus on a first-come , first-served-basis campaign . Cities Transit Inc. did not object ( Negroes made up 60% of its passengers before the boycott ) . Tallahassee 's city commission objected furiously , suspended the company 's franchise for not enforcing segregation . The company responded with a plea for an injunction preventing interference with its operations until the court decided whether Florida 's bus-segregation law is still valid . Judge DeVane granted the injunction , but it was , as his ruling implied , just the beginning of prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South last week , the anti-bus-segregation drive-and reaction to it by white extremists-went far beyond litigation . In Birmingham , Ala. the Rev. Mr. Fred L. Shuttlesworth , 34 , antisegregation leader and pastor of a local Negro Baptist church , told the city commission to end bus segregation by the day after Christmas , or " we will take whatever action is necessary . " Late Christmas night six or more dynamite sticks blasted the Shuttlesworth house . Miraculously , Shuttlesworth and his family escaped serious hurt . Shuttlesworth next day led some 150 of his followers in broad-scale , nonsegregated bus riding , later was persuaded to call off the drive after 22 Negroes were arrested for Jim Crow violations . <P> In Montgomery , where Negroes and whites rode together peacefully in the first days after integration , Christmas week brought the first big kickbacks from lunatic-fringe groups . In three nights snipers fired on and struck four buses , wounding a 22-year-old Negro laundry worker in both legs . The city commission , declaring that " an emergency exists , " ordered all nighttime bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snipers was arrested . Said a city detective : " We have no leads-nothing to work on .
