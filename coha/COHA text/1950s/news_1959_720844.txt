txt Raising a " clear and vigorous " voice in behalf of the smaller nations in the North Atlantic alliance , Paul-Henri Spaak , secretary general of the treaty organization , calls for full consultation of all the allies and not just the big ones in formulating a European policy for the projected EastWest summit meeting in the interest of Western unity . There have been many previous requests of that kind , and numerous efforts have been made both to improve the consultative machinery and to expand the scope of the alliance , with indifferent results . Now M. Spaak renews the call with some urgency and finds a sympathetic response not only among the smaller but also among most of the bigger allies . The reasons are obvious . With all the projects for summit meetings , first between the Western Big Four , then between the Western Big Three and Premier Khrushchev , with more to follow , the smaller and some not so small allies such as Italy begin to fear that they are being crowded into the background and are being reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already harping on this theme to split the alliance . Beyond that , the smaller allies feel that their fate is just as much involved in a European settlement as that of the bigger ones . And both the smaller and the bigger European allies , including France and Germany , feel that such a settlement should not be determined primarily by such extra-European powers as the United States and Britain , but should be based on a common policy to which the Europeans themselves have contributed . The United States has always emphasized that the North Atlantic alliance consists of equal and independent partners and has promoted the greatest possible consultation among them . But with crucial East-West meetings in the offing , M. Spaak would elevate the consultations by means of a top-level meeting of all the allies to coincide with the Westeri summit meeting , and that proposal deserves sympathetic consideration . There is , however , another side to that picture . Though equal in status , the allies are not , of course , equal in their contribution to the alliance because of their varying size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested a weighted majority vote in the alliance instead of the principle of unanimity . But it goes without saying that the right of consultation should carry with it the duty on the part of all allies to make the greatest possible contribution to the common cause in proportion to their capacity . The European allies might well search their collective conscience as to whether they have lived up to that requirement . Due to American economic aid , Western Europe is now enjoying unprecedented prosperity and is beginning to requite the United States by eliminating discriminations against dollar imports . But the chief burden of Western defense , even in Europe , still falls on the United States and Britain , which not only provide the bulk of the Western defense expenditures but also the key troops , with a service term of twenty-four months , while most of the Continental allies have cut the service terms to between eighteen and twelve months . The people of Western Europe can do better than that .                @ @ @ @ @
