The patients suffered from a variety of mental disorders . Some had anxiety neuroses , others fought against irrational fears , morbid thoughts , hallucinations , a few had drifted into suicidal depression . But for all of them the treatment was the same . Strapped to an operating table , they got three quick jolts of electricity-enough to start violent , involuntary convulsions before they lapsed into anesthetic coma . Next a thin , icepick-like leucotome was inserted under each eyelid , hammered home through the eye socket and into the brain . Carefully manipulating the two icepicks , the doctor severed the connection between thalamus and frontal lobes in the patient 's brain . The entire operation took only ten minutes . <P> By the time he finished his experiments with patients in West Virginia mental hospitals last month , Washington Neurologist Walter Freeman had supervised or performed more than 200 of these transor-bital lobotomies ( TIME , May 28 , 1951 ) in two weeks . He already had more than 1 , 000 other lobotomies to his credit . Many doctors still doubt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " explained one psychiatrist last week , " is an operation of deduction rather than addition . " It does irreparable damage to that part of the brain which is believed to control reason and judgment . It should only be used as a last resort , in desperate cases when all else has failed . But Dr. Freeman , who once said , " I wo n't touch them unless they are faced with disability or suicide , " now believes that " it is safer to operate than to wait . " Lobotomy , he insists , " should be considered in a mental patient who fails to improve after six months of conservative therapy . " <P> Many psychiatrists also hesitate before the uncertain results of lobotomy . Completely successful , the operation may relieve a patient 's tensions . It can also eliminate fear of pain . Dr. Freeman estimates that within six months , 100 of his West Virginia patients will have improved enough to leave the hospital . And getting people out of mental hospitals is his main objective . <P> But for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hospital , the operation may be too " successful . ' " Free from anxiety , they may become , instead , irresponsible , tactless , indolent . They will probably have trouble making up their minds , and may hear voices or echoes . Worse than that , some may regress into placid animals , helpless for the rest of their lives . <P> By last week Dr. Freeman had these statistics from his West Virginia experiment : of 228 patients , 86 have been discharged from the hospital ; five have already returned . There are 36 more ready to go home as soon as their families can take them . Another 29 have shown some improvement but still need hospital care . Of the 77 remaining , 73 have shown no improvement ; four have died .
