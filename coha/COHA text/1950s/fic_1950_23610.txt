Drawings by Andy Warhol oNDER. what their children will be like ? " My Aunt Molly Bloom had no more than dragged her lace veil through the church door before Mrs. Oliver ( of the Fat Olivers ) bulldozed through the crowd and asked my grandmother . " Wonder what their children will be like ? " " Like rabbits , probably . " Grandmother did not try to hide her feelings about her new son-in-law . " If I know Mr. W. R. Goatt . " Perhaps a more prophetic statement was never shouted in the South Side Baptist Church . During the next five years Aunt Molly Bloom and Mr. Goatt had five children : Matthew , Mark , Luke , John  --  and Little Acts who became known as " Mutt " because Matthew was the first word he tried to say and " Mutt " was what it sounded like . They tell the story about Mutt two ways in our town . Some say he was a most unusual baby , raising their eyebrows all over the place , but then people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally occurs . They even quote Nurse Emmie Davis , who everybody knows is so nearsighted she has n't even seen her own mirror in years , that Mutt as a baby was a sight . Well , you ca n't tell this long afterwards . Maybe he was . But then there are the other people , friends largely of the family , who say he was like any baby and child in the world until he met Mrs , Ludie Shaggs . Mrs. Shaggs , to tell the truth , was a striking blonde creature  --  double-breasted if ever a woman was . She carried herself like a pouter-pigeon and all the children in the neighborhood bet that she had to sleep on her back to keep from feeling like she was sleeping uphill . They had visions of her , lying there prone , like a board on a seesaw , with sometimes her head stuck into the air and at other times her feet . Probably neither did , but that 's what all the children reckoned . No one knew much about Mr. Shaggs except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derby hats and was liable to keep any football that landed in his flower-bed  --  which Grandmother later put a dreadful curse on . And sure enough , it has withered and died . ( But then so , for that matter , has Grandmother . ) A NYWAY , it was there the afternoon B.B , Nelson punted a ball over his back fence into the Shaggs garden . Although Mr. Shaggs had never been known to speak to a child in the neighborhood , it was under-stood that any boy caught alive in that backyard would n't live to remember it . Both teams went over to the wooden fence and peeped through the cracks at the football where it lay side by side with a purple dahlia almost as large . Even children could see that the flower was a prize-winner . They did n't say as much . They merely said , " Uh oh , " and Sissy Burton remembered that his mother wanted him that minute . If Sissy had n't run out the driveway they probably would have thrown him over the fence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was they stood back , stared angrily at each other , and then at B.B. who had punted the ball . B.B. searched the ground and then the back steps where little Mutt Goatt sat , mouth open , whittling with a butcher knife . Mutt was only five , not quite six , at the time and did n't know anything about the Shaggs . Or maybe he did know and just did n't care . You could n't tell about Mutt . They watched him whittling and decided he was the one to send . Mr. Skaggs might have mercy on such a little boy ' and if he did n't  --  too bad . It was argued that Mutt 's bite was worse than Mable 's , a bulldog that was tied to the lunch stand after school each day . Unfortunately no person they knew of had ever been bitten by both , so the argument was purely theoretical . Nevertheless , a rope was tied around Mutt 's waist , and B.B. and his brother , sitting on the fence rail , lowered Mutt into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peony bush , just as he had been coached to do , and tried to untie the rope . ball . Well meet you out front . " MAGAZINE The boys ran halfway round the block and stood in float of the Shaggs ' house to wait for Mutt to come running , rope trailing , out the drive , with the football that cost , they remembered now , eighty-nine cents , almost a dollar . Five minutes passed and they were still waiting . Thirty minutes later seven of the boys were sitting on the stone wall in front of the Shaggs ' , looking up the lawn at the old house . On the other side four of the boys were seated on the wooden fence staring moodily down into the garden where little Mutt had last been seen . The football was gone : but so was the beheaded dahlia . Ten more minutes passed and the boys on the back fence began seeing signs of what must have been a struggle in the garden . At about the same time it came to all the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tossed him in the coal hopper . They joined forces at the corner , marched up the street , . and bravely up the drive to the basement window . B.B. Nelson was ready to punt the glass in when they heard the clink of a spoon above . There tapping on the pane with an ice cream spoon was Mutt . Before him was a water goblet half full of lime sherbert and behind him in full bloom was Mrs. Shaggs . T AJTE that afternoon , long after he had tossed the football from the Shaggs ' porch to the waiting boys , Mutt came sauntering up the street , carrying the purple dahlia on the up-raised palms of his hands . He kept the flower before his plate during supper , and his breathing which was always heavy was a rumbling sigh tonight . " Do n't breathe like that ! " Aunt Molly Bloom said . " Ca n't help it , " Mutt said , still gazing at the gaudy purple flower which he was touching lightly with his fingertips . " We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle W.R. said . " My what ! " Mutt glanced up in alarm . " Adenoids . " Uncle W.R. explained what and where and why about the adenoids . " Oh , " Mutt said . He took the flower to bed with him that night and used it as a pillow . He lay on his back , hands joined under his head , the flower under his hands . About two o'clock an autumn storm churned through town and Aunt Molly went in to see if Mutt was covered up . He was still lying there , eyes wide , staring at the ceiling . " Did the storm wake you ? " she asked . " What storm ? " he said . After that it was a fresh flower every day  --  huge dahlias : purple , dark red , white , and yellow , but mostly purple . Mutt tried to press them between the pages of his Gulliver book but the flowers were too large and fat for that , so he kept them in a wheelbarrow under the house . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be kept from running off to the Shaggs ' . " Does Mr. Shaggs know you 're picking his prettiest flowers ? " Aunt Molly asked . " Who gives them to you ? " " Ludie , " Mutt said casually . He smiled at the flower in hand . " Who is Ludie ? " " Her , " Mutt said . " Mrs. Shaggs . " " Ludie ! We 'll have a little more respect out of you , young man . Now do n't let me hear you say Ludie again . " Mutt laughed at the flower , tossed it into the air , and caught it . He was out the door and down the street to the Shaggs ' before Aunt Molly could warn him again . It was two days later that he came home smelling of smoke . He had already been to the pantry and eaten peanut butter , but he still smelled of tobacco and smoke . " Have you been smoking ? " Uncle W.R. asked at supper . " No , " Mutt said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of his head and at his ears . " You most certainly have . " she said , " or else you 've been mighty close to somebody who has . " " Lu . . , " Mutt began . " Mrs. Shaggs kissed me good-by . " " Oh , " Aunt Molly sighed with relief . Uncle W.R. chuckled . " Does Mr. Skaggs know you kiss his wife good-by ? " " Oh hell no ! " Mutt said , red as the flower before his plate . " Probably just as well , " my uncle said . It was n't until the next morning that Aunt Molly realized Mutt had said a cuss word , and whipped him for it . He was furious . He stalked out of the house and did not return until dark . He had eaten , he said , both lunch and dinner ( not dinner and supper , mind you ) at the Shaggs ' . He would n't eat anything even before he went to bed , but at three o'clock that morning they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look very happy . Aunt Molly and her husband stood there in the door and watched him . " Are you sick ? " Aunt Molly asked . " No . " Mutt rubbed his chin as though to see if he needed a shave . " Just could n't sleep . " " W.R. , something 's got to be done , " my aunt said . " For instance ? " her husband asked . " Well , for one thing , he 's got to stay away from that Shaggs woman . " " Promise your mother you 'll stay away from Ludie Shaggs , " my uncle said . " I wo n't . " " You wo n't what ? " " I wo n't promise . " " Ca n't say as I blame you . " Mr. Goatt winked , clicked his tongue , and went back to bed . " What either of you see in that blonde hussy ! " Aunt Molly was saying as she followed my uncle down the dark hall . " Poor fools . " T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shut and locked the next morning and Mutt was promised a whipping if he went out of the yard or even so much as touched the gate or the iron-spike pickets of the front fence . He was allowed to play on the wooden fence enclosing the backyard but warned that if he had any ideas about falling , he 'd better commence planning immediately to fall in his own yard , and preferably on his feet . That week he played in the yard , Aunt he was happy : he ate well , he slept well , lie laughed , and he was learning to whistle . As the autumn days grew shorter , colder , more full of falling leaves , Mutt became more restless . He wandered about the front yard , cheeks puffed out , lips puckered , whistling the strangest whistle you ever heard , more like the piping of a broken kettle than anything , at times scarcely hearable , at times shrill . When a woman would pass down the street , Mutt would head for the gate and with fingers between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact that Preacher Clement stopped to ask if the young man in the yard would not he more happily occupied if allowed to play with other children his own age . Of course Aunt Molly could not explain MAGAZINE to the preacher why Mutt was being kept in ; or at least she thought she could n't , not knowing it was a public secret . " Then at least , " Preacher Clement pleaded , " can he be prevailed upon to refrain from this whistling after women . My wife has become so haunted by it she 's taken to going to town by Mulberry Street , two whole blocks out of the way . " Then he added painfully , " Through my instructions . " He mumbled , Aunt Molly still believes , something to the effect that his wife was all he had and that he was n't the only husband who was worried about the recent behavior of several of the ladies who had to pass this way . Whatever he meant , Aunt Molly was touched by his tone and manner . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when later in the afternoon she saw Mrs. Ludie Shaggs talking to him at the front fence and even reaching through to pat him on the head ( right there in open daylight , before God and all the neighbors , if you can imagine ) she was so upset she almost changed her mind . 1 T WOULD N'T have made any difference what she decided because the next morn- ing Mutt did not come down to break-fast . He was not in his bed , his room , the house , or yard . About four o'clock Mr. Shaggs phoned and said with no more ceremony than a banker : " Where 's my wife ? " Aunt Molly declared she did n't know . " She damn well better be home before dark ! " He slammed down the receiver before she could ask him if he 'd seen Mutt . At dark , my uncle answered the telephone . " Where 's my wife ? " the angry voice said . " Where 's my son ? " Mr. Goatt said , equally as angry because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . But I do know where he 'll he if he sets foot in my house again . Or if another of my dahlias is missing ! " He slammed down the receiver . " I think that man is unhappy , " my uncle said . " You think he meant that threat ? " " Certainly . I tell you he 's unhappy . " " The frost will probably take care of the flowers soon anyhow , " Aunt Molly said hopefully . " Frost wo n't take care of Mutt though . It 's time he 's taught to be discreet , if nothing else . " Fortunately he was asleep when Mutt crept in after midnight . No one knows yet how Mr. Goatt intended teaching his son to be discreet , but the beginning did seem to he inspired simplicity . Some people say my uncle picked up the idea while he was training horses in the horse cavalry , but it does n't make much difference now . What he did was this : he stretched a wire , strong as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house to a tree near the wood fence . On this he hitched a chain leash , and to the leash a collar , and in the collar Mutt . He locked it with a little lock and took the key with him because Aunt Molly was already crying at the sight of her son on a leash . Every time little Mutt ran , the chain rattled and Aunt Molly had to cover her ears or dry her eyes . Finally she put cotton in her ears and stayed on the other side of the house . Just before dinner , however ( she had worked her way to the upstairs , where she had begun making the beds ) , it occurred to her , she does n't know why , to look out the window . Sure enough , two backyards away , in the dahlia garden , Mrs. Shaggs in a red and white flowered kimono , was cutting a huge blossom . She held it first in her hair and from the upstairs window it looked like a flop-hat . She must have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her low neckline , between her mighty bosoms . She must have been delighted with the effect because she pinned it there , then tossed her blonde hair back over her shoulder in one quick lift of her chin . Ten minutes later when Aunt Molly stuck her head out the window to tell Mutt to come to the back steps for his dinner , he was gone . Mrs. Shaggs was gone too . The broken leash was hanging empty from the wire . Aunt Molly went straightway to the phone and called her husband : ' ' W.R. , she 's got him . Came right into the yard and took him . " " That kid ! " Uncle W.R. said proudly . " What ? " Aunt Molly Bloom was shouting . " Real sex appeal . " " Mrs. Shaggs ? " " The kid . " " Oh . " Aunt Molly sounded relieved . Then : " What are we going to do ? " " Just wait . He 'll come back when he gets tired . " They waited all night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Maybe lie 's not going to get tired . " " Quit leering and finish your coffee . " Aunt Molly was already taking dishes from the table . I T was then that the phone rang . Mr. Shaggs was dead . The children were already chanting the news in the street . " Dead in the bed with a bullet in his head . " All afternoon a crowd fringed the Shaggs house , peeping in at the shade-drawn windows , searching the garage , and rambling curiously in the flower garden . His car , everyone knew , was gone ; his wife and her clothes , some said , were gone ; and even though Aunt Molly tried to keep it a secret , someone , then everyone , knew that Mutt was gone . The death was explained in the only four possible ways : Mr. Shaggs had killed himself upon discovering his wife 's elopement ; Mrs. Shaggs had killed him to escape ; Mutt had accidentally killed him ; Mutt had killed him intentionally . To complicate matters , Sissy Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be thrown over the fence that autumn day to get the football . He confessed in the frontyard that he had done the killing . Everyone thought he was bragging and so ignored him . Then he got to feeling so guilty he was afraid they would believe him and went around declaring that he had not done the killing . Somehow it was very casual . " After all , " Preacher Clement said , " you ca n't take the actions of a six-year-old boy seriously . " He glanced about the crowd , nervously searching for his wife in the gathering dusk . " I do hope , " she was saying with a sparkling gleam in her eye , " that they find that boy before Ludic Shaggs goes very far with him . " " If you ask me , " Uncle W.R. began , " she 's already . .. " " Nobody did . So shut up . " Aunt Molly could not keep him from praising Mutt 's accomplishments and persistence . That night they left the door open and the coffeepot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restless night for the entire neighborhood . Lights in every house flashed on , burned brightly for a while , then as suddenly went off . Toward dawn , which was cold and gray , Ludie Shaggs drove up to her house , blew her horn to wake the two policemen who were keeping watch in the patrol car , and then went with them down to the jail . She claimed she did not know her husband was dead when she left town with Mutt . She had packed her clothes that afternoon , left Mutt in the house bathing while she went down to have the car checked . It was during that half-hour that her husband must have come home and found Mutt in the tub . According to Mrs. Skaggs , Mutt said there had been an argument through the locked bathroom door in which Mr. Shaggs threatened to kill him if he ever came in the house again . Mutt , looking for a towel , found the pistol in the bathroom linen closet , opened the door , and walked into the bedroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaggs said , sitting down on the bed . Mutt , in his simple way , walked up to him and let him have it , right in the head . " He was as calm as I 'd ever seen him , " Mrs. Shaggs was sobbing when Uncle W.R. appeared at the police station . " Was waiting for me on the back steps . Had dragged my suitcase out into the yard . The house is all locked , ' he told me . I tried the back door and it was locked . I did n't know Mr. Shaggs had already come home . We left in a hurry because it was almost time for him . " " Where did you last see the boy ? " Uncle W.R. asked . - At a tavern on the other side of Atlanta , Georgia . Drinking beer with two college girls in a convertible . I 'd gone to see about a cabin and when I got back there he was with these two bi ... biddies . " She sobbed . " I said , ' Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , Pipe down , Grandma . ' I went to the cabin and watched him from the window . The way he was carrying on with those two girls ! Right there before my eyes . And them squealing and acting so damned coy . They had the radio going and that 's how he knew the police were already after us . He came in and told me what I 've done told you . I said , ' Let 's get out of here . Florida maybe . ' I was scared . ' Beat it , ' he said , ' I 'm stickingwith them . ' He jerked his thumb over his shoulder at the convertible outside . I could tell by watching him as he got back in the car that he was already far gone with one of the girls  --  the hloncle . I started out after him . I chased them a good fifteen miles before they lost me . " T HE more they checked the more the police believed Mrs. Shaggs ' story . The fingerprints on the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , testified that Mrs. Shaggs was with him during that half-hour in which neighbors remembered hearing the shot . When he married Ludie a year later half the town wanted to reopen the case , but the other half wanted fervently to forget the whole affair , and more specially to forget Mutt . As happens with the memory of most ruggedly defined and active men , a cloud of rumor sprang up around the memory of Mutt to soften the ruggedness and hide the spectacular differences . He was never heard from directly again . A tabloid claimed he was smuggled across the Mexican border in a baby carriage by a silent-movie vampire . Other people said she took him to Hollywood where he would n't be noticed . Some claimed it was to New York where he would be appreciated . Others claimed he was forced by a Chicago gangster to take a vow of silence and withdraw from society . Just before the war a psychologist settled in the town and put forward the theory that Mutt never really existed , that he was merely the six-year-o/d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's knowing myth . A good many people began believing the psychologist but when he went off to the war , Preacher Clement , who had objected violently to the theory , put forward the notion that perhaps the psychologist had never really existed  --  an idea that many people found just as attractive . Anyway , all I know is that I 'm glad Mrs. Ludie Shaggs had courage enough to come back and live , knowing that people were pointing her out and talking about her , as they did and do , even to this very day .
