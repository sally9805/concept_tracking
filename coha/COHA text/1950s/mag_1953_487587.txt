IN THE concluding lines of the funeral oration delivered over Robert Marion La Follette , Sr , in the rotunda of the Wisconsin state capitol on June 22 , 1925 , Dr. A. E. - Haydon of the University of Chicago Divinity School said , " The old enemies against which he fought still are in the field . the causes which he championed still call for battling , heroic hearts . The future democracy of which he dreamed still is to win . . . . And here , here in his presence still , we may with bowed heads and ( inlet courage dedicate ourselves to that sublime and splendid task . " Dr. Haydon 's words point up the chief impression one carries away from this tremendously valuable biography of a man whose dramatic life story it tells for the first time in- a comprehensive way . The two-volume work is the result of more than a quarter of a century of painstaking preparation on the part of his wife , Belle Case La Follette , and his daughter Fola . Mrs. La Follette wrote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1910 . There the narrative is taken up by Fola . One can not relive the turbulent and courageous life of this great champion of American democracy without realizing that we must make much the same fight today , when once again the massive evil of special privilege has gained the citadel of government and Is assaulting the American heritage with its weapons of hysteria and intolerance . The life of La Follette is a superb study of how fear and bigotry were used to mask the plundering and profiteering against which he fought . Then the charge was " radicalism , " " socialism , " and " proGermanism . " Today it is " communism , " used in the same way by the forces of McCarthyism to distract attention from the colossal swindle of the tidelands-oil deal and the other raids upon the public domain now preparing ' in Washington . One wonders how La Follette would fare in the present struggle to give democracy greater vitality and purpose . Certainly , one can not come away from this biography without a deep respect for his ability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political power ever achieved so much . He lived to see most of the planks of the minority platforms his . Wisconsin delegations presented at the national conventions only to have them rejected as " socialism " ? become the law of the land . In Wisconsin , where he wielded a power he never had nationally , he wrought reforms which gained the state the reputatiOn of being the- " ideal commonwealth . " These were not battles easily won . Mrs. La Follette recounts his fight to achieve justice in railroad rates The railroads accused him of telling only part of the story in the examples he used to expose their methods His answer was to prepare a study of the rates chdrged by the two principal railroads in the state , listing every station in Wisconsin and comparing the rates between them and their markets with corresponding sates in Iciwa and Illinois . At a special session of the legislature he presented an incontrovertible argument based on this study that made a book of 181 pages This was typical of his thoroughness in getting the facts to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today when the hucksters of TV and radio give a man like Richard Nixon complete laundry service with the frothy suds of soap opera , and when representatives of the big New York public-relations firms take over the White House prior to a Presidential report to the nation ? LA FOLLETTE never lost his faith in facts and in the ability of people to understand them . The biography deals in detail with the proceedings on bill after bill in the Senate in which he took part . Because he came with the facts and insisted that opposing Senators do the same , they feared and hated him . Wisconsin 's most recent contribution to legislative debate is the exposition of how a Senator can exploit the immunity bestowed by his office to slander his fellow-citizens . Before the atmosphere of hate and resentment in the Senate , La Follette never flinched , He used all his great talents as a debater against the plundering of the big-business interests which dominated his party . And when the session was over , he hit the hot , dusty Chautauqua trail to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators , some of whom did not return to Washington thereafter . He would never allow the rules of senatorial courtesy to draw him into a conspiracy against the interests of the people , as was the case with so many Senators . When he made a " speech in another state he often discomfited some fellow-Senator who out of courtesy and a desire- to appear before one of his crowds had introduced him . THE HOSTILITY built up in these years came to a climax in the ordeal that he suffered in World War I. American history may never record another instance in which one man became the target of so much abuse and slander . In the hysteria engendered by the super-patriots of the day his oldest and dearest friends left him and joined in the cries of " disloyalty " and " treason . " Men who owed their positions to him , including many faculty members of the University of WiscOnsin whose interests he had always chathpioned , used their prestige and power to blacken his name . The legislature branded him disloyal . The newspapers lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to correct a report of his speech in St. Paul ? in which he was quoted as having said that " we had no grieVances against Germany , " when , as the A. P. later acknowledged , he had actually said we did have grievances . This misquotation was an important part of the charges brought to expel him from the Senate . La Follette had supported and sponsored some sixty measures to back the war effort once the nation was - involved , but this was never mentioned by those who vilified him as a traitor . Against the raging storm of hysteria he fought his battle during the day and at night went home to keep vigil at the bedside of Bob , Jr. , who was close to death with a serious illness . The illness of his son sapped his income , and only through the help of . a few loyal friends was a mortgage foreclosure on his beloved farm home at Madison avoided . It is one of the proudest memories of my life that as a member of the Wisconsin Assembly I led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time when he stood almost alone in defense of the democratic ideals for which we were presumed to be fighting . La Follette won his vindication after the hysteria had abated . In 1922 he was ' reelected by the biggest ceived Up to that time by in Wisconsin . And after home from Washington for the last time , the legislature , the board of regents of the university , the alumni association , December-19 , 1953 and many other groups passed resolutions honoring his great service to the state and nation . The present biography is not concerned simply with his public life In a tender and moving narrative it depicts the warm human qualities of the mama man who could f , : ind time at a particularly critical monient in the affairs of the Senate to write to a Madison veterinary to plead with him to save one of his beloved horses which had become ill But most notable is the picture of his deep and everlasting devotion to his family . One wonders how he ever found the time to write the letters he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own handwriting , full of love and humor . SINCE THIS remarkable biography was written by members of his family , the historian may approach it with some reservations about its objectivity . But there is much evidence to show that no effort has been made to represent him as infallible . The material , taken from newspapers , books , magazines , Congressional and legislative records , personal interviews , and letters , gives the case against him as well as for him . His unusual and rather shameful personal attack on Senator Kellogg , one of those who led the expulsion movement against him , is set forth with the notation that Mrs. La Follette was critical of his conduct in that instance . Commenting on her husband 's failure to support Lieutenant Governor Davidson for governor against Irvine Lenroot , Mrs. La Follette wrote , " Bob is perhaps justly criticized for having encouraged Davidson to run for lieutenant governor if he questioned his capacity to lead the Wisconsin movement independently . I would not claim that in meeting the exigencies of politics Bob was always consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , the La Follette biography has a beauty and warmth it might not . otherwise have had . This is illustrated in the letter of - Fola to a friend describing the old Senator 's death " He went to sleep , " she wrote , " and we shall not hear his voice again  --  strangely that was the thought that came to each one of us when dear Dr. Marbury looked up and signed to us that all our yearning and love could do no more for him . The transition was so gentle and un troubled that ' , though he had his hand on Daddy 's pulse , Dr. Marbury could not be certain it had come until he listened with the stethoscope . We kissed his brow in silence and turned to Mother  --  and she gave us of her strength , speaking of how Daddy had loved life and found it good . And from this thought it seemed as if everything flowed . Through all the hours and days that followed each             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
