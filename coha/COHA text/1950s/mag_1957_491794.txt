ous . " So perhaps the tide should be How Not to Be Funny . It just goes to show you what a difference a little altitude makes , since Mr. Watts works for a tabloid-size daily on the lowerend of Manhattan , and Mr. Atkinson toils for a high-IQ journal somewhat farther uptown . The truth is , there are days when I do n't know what I am . When I came to New York from my native Copenhagen I was worried by those magazine spreads which proclaimed : " They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano . " I thought this meant I had a formidable rival in my field , and this man obviously had a great press agent because this same full-page publicity was in all the magazines . When I learned English and realized this was only an advertisement for a music correspondence school , I could see that if people laughed when this man sat down at the piano he had obviously goofed , and would wind up as a social outcast . All this was very confusing because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano . If they did not laugh I would have to go back to Carnegie Hall , although , of course , I had not been there yet . On the other hand . there really is humor which can be more painful than hilarious . Not long ago I was offered a guest shot on a television program . They call it that because often the star show that I have recently broken a lot of box-office records . " You 've grossed more than a million dollars in a year , " he will say glumly , " and what have you done with it ? " My agent , Harry Squires , is on the phone asking me if I want to go into the Cotton Bowl in Texas . " Who are we playing ? " I ask . " The Government ? " My five children are outside yelling like Indians , so I ca n't hear his reply . But if he books me , I 'll go . Matter of fact , I did go there last October . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham on wry , " and he was probably thinking I would go anywhere and do anything to get the lettuce . My pretty wife , Sanna , who is known to many as " The Dragon " because she is usually a fire-breathing guard outside my dressing room , is reminiscing in the den . She is playing an old recording of a radio interview I had with Irving Berlin years ago , and snatches of the dialogue drift through the hall . " Victor , I beg of you ... stick to the classics , " " But , Irving , every time I play Mozart I hear a little voice that whispers : ' Do n't play it , ... Do n't play it . ' " " You recognize the little voice ? " " Yes , Irving . It 's Mozart 's . " Sanna is obviously not overwhelmed by this repartee , and I expect her to call out : " Mr. B. , " ? that 's what she calls me ? " that was pretty bad . " But she says nothing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pond outside the house is an enormous bullfrog , the same one that keeps me awake every night , and he sounds as though he is blowing a threeba , which is a sort of oversized tuba . He is croaking to the other frogs , and I am reminded of an evening with Benny Goodman , during one of our exchanges on the Mobilgas show , We were talking about biographical movies , and I said , " Benny , if you were going to make a picture about a famous musician , whom would you choose ? " Benny pointed his clarinet like a gun and said , " James C. Petrillo . You 're not getting me in a jam with the union . " In the meadow on the other side of the pond is a flock of Australian sheep I bought from the Bing Crosby Enterprises , and they have been bleating off-key all day . The sheep wander out of sight over a hill , and the children have moved to another play spot . There is a sudden uncomfortable silence and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I play a chord . It sounds terrible because the piano is out of tune , The day is all shot anyway . So is the medley . I 'd better think about the story . I like the word " medley . " Webster says a medley is " a composition of passages or scraps .. detached from several different pieces . " The story I have to tell is probably not a story , but a medley . Passages and scraps . The passages will be pretty melodies , detached from the several different pieces of an exciting life , a life so crammed with good luck that sometimes it frightens me . The scraps will only go a round or two , perhaps with velvet gloves . I shall be talking about my so-called " feud " with Rudy Vallee , and whether I am as ungrateful as he says . There will be some friendly shadowboxing about Ed Sullivan , and who did or did not " discover " me . There will be a flurry here and there about music critics , and certain die-hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of the great composers . But no matter what I choose  --  a passage or a scrap-1 hope you wit . ' find it fun . Remember that simple little melody , Dear Hearts and Gentle People ? It reminds me of a recent trip to the Mayflower Hotel in Washington , D.C. , where I did a sell-out benefit for the Heart Fund . Afterward I turned over all the receipts from this one show in the form of a check made payable to President Eisenhower as chairman of the fund . Several days later I received a registered letter on pale green stationery from the White House . It read : Dear Mr. Barge : Thank you for your letter expressing such kind and encouraging sentiments . I are likewise grateful that through your efforts there has been raised such a substantial sum for the Heart Fend . Because the processing of your check through my hands would cause complications for my tax accountants , could you please withdraw this check and make it out instead to the Washington Heart Association ? With best wishes , Sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was tempted to say : " Dear Mr. President : I am glad that you also have complications with your tax accountants . Why do n't we citizens get together and do something about it ? " I did n't write any such letter , of course . And I 'm only fooling , Mr. President . I am so grateful that I can have the American privilege of making enough money to pay taxes and that I , who came here as an unknown only sixteen years ago , can get a personal letter of any kind from the President of the United Slates . Mr. Eisenhower , I know , would understand my impulse to joke about the matter . You see , 1 have not 86 THE SATURDAY E VE N INC P 0 ST forgotten the last time I kidded the ruler of an important nation , a man named Adolf Hitler . He issued orders to have me shot . If his men could catch me , that is . Thank God they never did . I can turn to another section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Chopin 's Waltz in C Sharp Minor . For a good many years this charming work , along with Chopin 's Polonaise in A Flat , has been what you might call a standard part of any pianist 's repertoire . But I used to say : " Frederic Chopin , or Fritz. as he is known here , wrote this waltz , Mr. Chopin is dead . He 'd better be  --  they buried him a hundred years ago  --  hut before 1847 this waltz had not been written  --  so Chopin wrote it because he wanted to hear what it would sound like , but when he first played it he did n't recognize it because he had never heard it before . " This patter was a lot of nonsense , of course , as a few stuffy music lovers have said bitterly . Sometimes I played the first few bars . 1 never liked playing bars because they 're so noisy . Sometimes 1 played excerpts , or did n't . Sometimes I did n't finish the waltz and occasionally I strangled it , or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nonsense , not the butchering . Anyway , there came a letter one day from a friend in Washington named Prentiss Coonley , inviting me to his home for a late dinner . I had a miserable cold that week , but decided to go anyway . I sniffled my way through my weekly television show , caught a plane at LaGuardia Airport and flev. to Washington . I was late getting to the Coonley home . and was the last guest to arrive , and so we started for the dining room without any of the customary predinner chit-chat . My eyes were blurred , and my head felt as though it had been stuffed into a space helmet . " Victor , " Prentiss said , " I 'm going to put you at the far end of the table , right next to the President . " " What President ? " I asked . " There 's only one , you nitwit , " he laughed . " President Truman , of course . " Now , I am not easily flustered . Ed Sullivan once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience ever frightened me , including a crowd of 95,000 we entertained at Soldier Field in Chicago . Essentially this is true . I have deep respect for an audience . I feel I am their guardian for an hour or two , and they trust me to give them what they came for . And I do it . But never with fear or even uncertainty . But I admit I was uneasy at the prospect of sitting beside Harry Truman , with those ubiquitous Secret Service men hovering around and perhaps touching their holsters every time I lifted my fork , For a number of years I had been doing a bit in which I would say : " My next number will be a classic by Beethoven  --  the Deep-Freeze Concerto , by Harry S. Beethoven . " I would pause a moment , and would then say : " You will recognize the beat  --  Vaughan-two , Vaughan-two . " It fractured people , I do n't know why , but it did . It still breaks up an audience . I knew that President Truman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion  --  that will be another story in my medley  --  and I had been told he laughed as loudly as the rest . But there he sat , with his napkin practically in my lap , and I waited for some mild reproof . But he never mentioned the spoofing , and soon we were talking music . He had a remarkable knowledge of music and composers , and my admiration could n't have been more profound . We gathered around the piano after dinner , and after clowning for a few minuses , I asked him what he would like to hear . " I love Chopin , " he said . So I played what I knew was his favorite  --  the Waltz in C Sharp Minor . I looked up as I touched the keys , and I saw Chief Justice Vinson , Attorney General Tom Clark and other Cabinet officers gathered around the President , and for the first time in months I played the waltz through to the last delicate note . When it was over , the President walked up to me , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . His eyes were wet and shining behind the glasses , and he said , " I have heard them all , but I have never heard a more beautiful touch . " I am not a politician and I avoid political arguments , but one thing I know . Harry Truman has music in his heart . There are other tones in my medley , and each of them has a part in the making of an American citizen . There are the thousands of miles I traveled by bus , car , plane , boat , train , tractor , bicycle and on foot , playing theaters , auditoriums and schools in the forty-eight states . I have flown through snowstorms , hurricanes and dust in small chartered planes to make a date on time , and have had some near misses that may account for the distinguished-looking gray in my hair . Only last August 1 was in an Air Force C-47 , flying over France en route to do some shows for American troops at Evreux . The plane was struck by lightning and after bouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we got down with our skins intact . I got out after we landed , raised my hand and said , " I hereby swear I 'll never tell another joke about Debussy . Not in France , anyway . " I have cut , pinched , torn and broken my fingers-1 never should have bought those do-it-yourself kits  --  and I played at least one performance with my thumb in a cast . The critics , alas , thought the bandage was a new gag and suggested 1 could do without it . I have composed music , including a symphony for eighty-six saxophones and a drum . I call it Holiday for Strings . Among my newfound friends , just to name three or four , is Tallulah Bankhead . The last time I was on a network program with her , she refused to speak to me . " I never saw this man before , " she said . " I never recognize anyone who steals my show . " I remember the day I almost did n't get my American citizenship because I lent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made him suspicious . There was the wartime day when I was arrested in Hollywood as a German-spy suspect , and with my accent at the time they could have stood me up against a wall . There was the morning I first drove into Jacksonville , Florida , and saw a group of men fishing from a bridge . " What are you fishing for ? " I asked , like a friendly tourist . The first man did n't even look up . " Meatballs , " he said . That man was a free thinker , and I 've had a warm feeling for Jacksonville ever since . There was an evening in Victoriille , California  --  which town was not named after me , by the way  --  when a car shot across the road and smashed head-on into mine . I was in the hospital for weeks and thought I would never play again . I remember being hungry in Wheeling . West Virginia  --  we could n't seem to find an open restaurant  --  and going into a delicatessen to invent the famous Borge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slices of meat , and I must say the butchers and meat packers are happy whenever I mention it , I recall disguising myself as a ferryboat deck hand so I could sneak into Denmark to see my dying mother for the last time , and waiting for the dreaded moment  --  it had happened to some of my friends  --  when the Gestapo would suddenly close in and you disappeared forever . I remember my first Christmas Eve in New York , when I stepped out on the hotel fire escape , thinking it was like the hotel balconies we had in Europe . I fell through the staircase opening and was saved only by a desperation clutch at the iron rail . There was an evening in New York , only a few weeks after I got off the boat with my skimpy vocabulary of fifty English words , when I failed miserably in my first Broadway appearance . For one despairing moment I thought of ending my life , but affectionate advice from an old Danish friend made me change my mind . And there was another evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Columbia Broadcasting System man handed me a check for 5175,000 for doing a one-hour television show . They tell me it was the highest fee ever paid one man for sixty minutes on stage , even though the Variety editors still think the figure was much less . But it would have been full circle for me at almost any price . Where does a man start the medley of his life ? I do n't know , But there is one major theme which has a persistent and irritating clamor , and which will not wait . It has been charged  --  if that is the word  --  that I have no respect for the immortals of music . They say Borge ridicules the great composers and makes fun of their works . There have been a number of these complaints , especially from elderly ladies who sit on the board of directors of a great symphony orchestra and piously appoint themselves defenders of the musical faith . They imply that they were impersonal friends of Richard Wagner , for instance , and indeed some of them may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear these matriarchs mumbling about the dignity of the classics , my memory goes . back to Copenhagen , when l was perhaps ten or twelve years old . I was often asked lo ! play at musical teas or salons or in private homes , and sometimes I would say : " My ' next selection will be the Beethoven Sonata No. 112 . " Afterward  --  and this happened many times  --  some of these musical experts would embrace me and exclaim , " My dear boy , I never heard Beethoven played more beautifully . " I never had the heart to tell them that they had not heard Beethoven at all . I had simply improvised every note , and they did n't know the difference . Arthur Godfrey , among others , had similar experiences when he made up stories about the great composers . When he . first began spinning records , for instance , he told his audience the " little-known fact " that Beethoven wrote his Sonata Pathetique while riding down the Rhine in a canoe given to him by a descendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so Arthur concluded , erroneously , of course , that nobody was listening to him . if anybody asks me about it , I tell them the canoe sank with all hands , and that was really pathetique . Let me put it this way : I do n't make fun of good music . I make fun with it . Were I able to resurrect Mozart , Brahms , Bach and other composers lust for a day , they would probably look awful . But I 'm sure they would be cheer leaders for my audiences . They were brilliant men , but any student of music knows they also had a great sense of humor , and much of that gaiety is shown in their works . t have never been able to understand why today 's concerts must be such a deadly serious business . You walk on to a stage and you look down at the audience . People are sitting there like pallbearers , almost daring you to make a mistake . Most of them do n't know a sonata from a tomata , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result , they lose the real enjoyment of the music . I know I have shocked a lot of people with some of my opening lines . I come on stage in white tie and tails , and l look as solemn as a lawyer reading a will to expectant heirs . I sit down at the piano and they expect a pretty ripple of notes . I pause , carefully place my hands on the keyboard , then turn back to the audience and say , " This piano was built to resemble a famous swimming pool . Now , many people have asked me this quesLion : ' Why are there three pedals on a piano ? ' Well , ladies and gentlemen , the pedal in the middle is there to separate the other two . That might be bad news for people with three feet  --  or more for that matter , but that is optional . " This , of course , is the truth , at least for people who do n't know better , and for those who do know better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . I was only about six when I left my first teacher and began taking lessons with Olivo Krause , of the Royal Danish Conservatory , and I liked him at once . He was bald-headed , and so were many of the musicians in the Royal Danish Orchestra , in which my father had been playing for many years . It was perfectly natural , therefore , for me to assume that the best musicians were those without any hair . I rushed home from school one day , snipped off all my hair and hurried to my lesson with the certainty that now I could be another Paderewski , even though my name was spelled differently . There may be amateur analysts who would interpret this act as a subconscious rebellion against so-called " longhair " music and musicians , but this is simply not so , I was scolded by my mother , naturally , and ridiculed by the neighborhood children . But 1 never applied the scissors to my hair again , and there was still enough left not so long ago for columnist Earl Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hair . " In the years since that childhood incident I have learned that my most sincere admirers  --  those who laugh because they know exactly what 1 am trying to do and say  --  are the professional musicians themselves . I was playing a Buffalo hotel sapper room once some years ago when 1 looked out over the clattering tables and saw Jascha Heifetz . He was having hysterics , doubling up like a man with a cramp and dabbing at his streaming eyes with a large silk handkerchief . After the performance he came backstage to tell me how much he enjoyed the evening . He was going to play with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra the following day , as I knew , with Steinberg conducting . He had chosen the Beethoven violin concerto and 1 was aching to go , even though I knew my schedule was tight and I would probably miss the first ten minutes . He asked me if I was coming to the concert . " I doubt it , " I said . " By the time I got there you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I start the concerto right after the intermission . I 'll have a seat at the box office for you . Please try to make it . " I said I would rush to the auditorium the moment my first show was over , and Heifetz said he would look for me . The next evening 1 virtually jumped from the stage into a waiting taxi and zipped down to the concert hall . The audience was seated when I got there , and the orchestra was poised . The instant I sat down , Heifetz came from the wings and began playing that sublime instrument of his . I found out later that he had stretched the intermission ten minutes , and did not come onstage , even though the audience was fidgeting , until he peeked out and saw that I was in my seat . It was one of the most heart-warming tributes of my life . I should add , I think , that I am not above joshing these titans of music when circumstances seem to call for it . On one occasion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , before I went on , the management announced from the stage that he had had an overflow audience the night before . l went down into the aisles , clutched the first unattached young man 1 saw , and led him to a chair in front of my piano . " Here is my overflow , " I said . Another time I appeared at the Municipal Auditorium in New Orleans in the wake of a memorable performance by Vladimir Horowitz , the great concert pianist . " Barge may be amusing , " one critic wrote the next day , " but he 's no Horowitz . " I did n't really mind , because I had the last word , That everting I read the review aloud from the stage and said , " I am sure this news will come as a relief to the parents of Mr. Horowitz . " On second thought , perhaps I should n't have said it . The auditorium had an open skylight , and I had just turned back to the piano when the skies exploded in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ceiling and nearly drowned half the audience , I guess Mr. Horowitz has powerful connections I did n't know about . One thing I do know . I am famous . A Manhattan restaurant has created a Victor Borgc. , Sandwich , and the fact that it is a turkey sandwich does not mean my show was a flop . I have had a baby named after me , and that seems reasonable , considering that I am its father . There is a gentleman in Highland Park , New Jersey , a Dr. Alfred Bloch , who says he is my double . His wife thinks he is better looking than I am , which is no trick at all , and he agrees with her . There is even a man named Victor Borges. 1 have never met him , but at one point we were both guests at the Waldorf in New York . This was extremely awkward because he kept getting my bills and my telephone calls . All F got from his letters were checks 1 could n't cash , unless , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final s . Yes , I am very well known . I see by the papers that I am Will Rogers Plus a Piano , Beatrice Lillie With Pants , the Noel Coward of Copenhagen , and the former summer replacement for Fibber McGee . Comedy in Music , my one-man show , broke the Broadway record for this type of show with 849 performances and , as a result , 1 get barrels of fan mail addressed to Victor Borga , Borgese , Borgne , Borgo and Borgha , Actually my full name was Robert Charles Arthur Victor Borge , but 1 dropped the first three . I got tired of being called RCA-Victor . Now there is a new one . I have a mean letter this morning addressed to Mr. Victor Borgia . This proves only that in this business you can easily be one man 's meat and another man 's poison .
