On the parade grounds at Washington 's Fort McNair last week , with ruffles &; flourishes , a 17-gun salute and a review of the troops , the U.S. Army marked the retirement of General James Alward Van Fleet , But Old Soldier Van Fleet 61 , on the inactive list after 38 years of service including 22 months as Eighth Army commander in Korea , was not yet ready to fade away . The morning after the ceremonies , he went back to the Capitol Hill firing line and expanded on his earlier testimony ( TIME , March 16 et seg. ) about the Eighth Army 's " serious shortage of ammunition . " <P> Operation Stopped . Disturbed by Van Fleet 's revelations last month , the Senate Armed Services Committee formed a special five-member subcommittee , headed by Maine 's able Margaret Chase Smith , to spotlight " the officials and conditions responsible for the shortages . " At the subcommittee 's first hearing last week , Van Fleet told the Senators that in June ' 1951 he " recommended to General Ridgway , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our May counteroffensive with an amphibious landing on the east coast , and had such an operation well prepared for execution . And that operation was stopped . " <P> Senator Harry Byrd : Who stopped it ? <P> Van Fleet : As far as I know , General Ridgway . <P> Byrd : You do n't know where his orders came from ? <P> Van Fleet : No , sir . <P> Byrd : And you believed at that time that you could have secured a rather decisive victory had you been permitted to continue your offensive ? <P> Van Fleet : Yes , sir . <P> This exchange made the hearing 's only headlines . Most of Van Fleet 's testimony was a reprise of things he had said before . He stuck to his guns , insisting that shortages of ammunition-especially of mortar and 155-mm. howitzer shells- had made it impossible to " plan adequate defensive fire , harassing , interdiction and counterbattery , to keep the enemy from launching an attack . " Asked whether he had enough ammunition to halt a Chinese offensive , Van Fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not maintain an offensive for more than a few weeks . They do not know how . " Van Fleet got strong supporting fire from the subcommittee 's only other witness of the week : Lieut . General Edward M. Almond ( ret. ) , commander of the X Corps under MacArthur , then Ridgway , then Van Fleet . Almond called the testimony of his ex-boss " sound and complete , " said that delays caused by ammunition shortages had " interfered with aggressive operations calculated to defeat the enemy . " <P> Counterattack Readied . After listening to Van Fleet and Almond , subcommittee members were surer than ever that some types of ammunition had been in chronically short supply in Korea . <P> From the Pentagon floated rumors that high Army brass was sharpening long knives for a counterattack on Van Fleet . The brass would find that he was well entrenched on Capitol Hill . One Senator wrote to Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens asking that Van Fleet be kept on active duty " because the country needs him . " And Styles Bridges was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as military advisor to his Appropriations committee . Van Fleet promised to think it over .
