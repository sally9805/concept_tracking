" You will come to your end either upon the gallows or of a venereal disease , " William Gladstone was said to have cried to his great political rival . Retorted Britain 's Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli : " I should say , Mr. Gladstone , that depends on whether I embrace your principles or your mistress . " <P> That the once-proud art of political invective in Britain has sadly sagged was demonstrated last week . Taking dinner with the New York Herald Tribune 's European Columnist Art Buchwald , Labor Party Leader Hugh Gaitskell relieved himself of a few mild pokes at Prime Minister Harold Macmillan : " I personally do n't trust Mr. Macmillan . My own personal opinion is that Mr. Macmillan is an actor , and I think all this publicity is dragging British politics to its lowest level . " Buchwald 's column quoting Gaitskell was printed in the Herald Tribune 's European edition , but not in the U.S. <P> As it developed , the outraged party was not Macmillan , but Gaitskell himself . Cried he : " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain to him-not , I fear , with much success-how our party system differed from the American . " After some coaching by his editors , Buchwald grudgingly apologized : " I am sorry that anything I have written should have given offense to Gaitskell , for whom I formed a high regard . I was writing as a columnist and not as a political commentator . I did not think for one moment that anyone would take the article literally . " But to inquiring press colleagues , he insisted : " I stand by my interview . " And on the basis of that insistence , the Herald Tribune made tentative plans to run the offending column in the U.S. this week .
