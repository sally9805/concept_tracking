The Mob ( Columbia ) rates a B-plus for its efforts with a B-picture plot : the old one about the detective who bores from within a big-city racket to get the goods on the mystery man at the top . It is full of sluggings , shootings and characters with fake identities ; the mastermind is the last anyone would suspect , and , at a venerably crucial moment in the final reel , the hero 's girl falls into the villain 's clutches . <P> Director Robert Parrish serves this rehash expertly , pointing up the tart flavor and inventive trimmings of William Bowers ' script . In his detective 's masquerade as an out-of-town hoodlum roughing his way into the favor of waterfront racketeers . Academy Award Winner Broderick ( All the King 's Men ) Crawford plays a tough guy 's tough guy with engagingly sardonic humor . <P> Come Fill the Cup ( Warner ) begins as the story of a crack newspaperman ( James Cagney ) who cracks up as an alcoholic . Out of a job , too wedded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) who wants to marry him , <P> Cagney becomes a ragged , drink-wheedling bum . Only his fright after a narrow brush with death under the wheels of a truck , and a night in the alcoholic ward , make him want to stop drinking . With the help of a reformed lush ( James Gleason ) , he painfully succeeds , though he never loses the craving for the one drink that he knows will start him skidding downhill again . <P> For the first third of the film , sharp dialogue , a good Cagney performance and the dramatized lore of alcoholism give Come Fill the Cup some of the kick of The Lost Weekend . But the rest is watered down with flat melodramatics . <P> The sober Cagney , having risen to city editor , is drafted by Publishing Tycoon Raymond Massey to reform his drunken nephew ( Gig Young ) , now the husband of Cagney 's old girl friend . The job proves mostly a matter of getting the nephew out of gangsters ' clutches . The film 's crude mixture of social problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug-ugly points a gun at Cagney and orders him to take a slug of bourbon . <P> Texas Carnival ( MGM ) turns Red Skelton and Esther Williams loose in a familiar but cheerful Technicolored antic . They play a carnival sideshow team mistaken for a pair of multimillionaires at a grandiose Texas resort hotel . <P> The picture balances one straight romance ( Actress Williams and Singer Howard Keel ) against one comic romance ( Comedian Skelton and Dancer Ann Miller ) , but it is dominated by Skelton 's buffoonery , which looks like a one-man history of low comedy - good , bad and indifferent . When he is good ( e.g. , gulping jelly beans at a poker game , only to learn he has devoured $5,000 worth of substitute chips ) , he is as funny as anyone on the screen . When he is bad ( e.g. , making cross-eyes ) , he is as tiresome as a small boy imitating Ben Turpin . <P> More consistent , and the freshest thing in the film , is Keenan Wynn 's performance as a cantankerous oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who puts his fist reverently to his heart when . anyone utters the sacred name of Texas .
