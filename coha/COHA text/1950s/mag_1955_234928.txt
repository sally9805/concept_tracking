Ever since the battle of Narva and Pskov in 1918 , * when the Bolsheviks won their first military victory , Feb. 23 has been Red Army Day in the U.S.S.R. Last week the Red army celebrated its 37th anniversary with the customary pomp but with special significance : for the first time since Narva and Pskov , its top officers hold highest political jobs . <P> Wherever there were Red army units ( and that was almost everywhere in the U.S.S.R. and a dozen other countries ) there were solemn festivals . In the huge Central Theater of the Red army in Moscow , the stage was loaded with military notables , their chesty uniforms stiffened with buckram to carry the weight of glittering decorations . Center of attention was Marshal Nikolai Bulganin , new Premier of the U.S.S.R. and longtime top military commissar . The speech of the day was made by the new Defense Minister Marshal Georgy Zhukov , who has a better right than Bulganin to call himself a soldier . <P> In the glare of klieg lights and television cameras , stocky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist prose , threatening the world ( and especially the U.S. ) with the might of the Red army . Lined up with Zhukov were Marshals Alexander Vasilevsky and Vasily Sokolovsky , present army chief of staff , while Stalin 's old buddy , white-whiskered Marshal Budenny , was on hand to give a cavalry dash to the gathering . Among the diamond-studded , gold-starred military uniforms , Party Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was a small , undistinguished figure in civilian clothes , but to remind the audience where the power lay , a huge banner had been hung across the stage : " Under the banner of Marx , Engels , Lenin , Stalin , under the leadership of the Communist Party-forward to the victory of Communism . " <P> Fighting Marshal . Beneath all the bombast the marshals had a message for the Soviet people . In its most pointed form it was delivered by egg-bald Marshal Ivan Konev , a figure of growing significance in the shifting Soviet scene . Pravda last week gave special prominence to an article by him . Konev was a Bolshevik before he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has earned his decorations the hard way and has the respect of the Russian people . <P> In World War II Konev commanded the north flank of Zhukov 's famous counterattack which thrust the Germans back from Moscow in December 1941 . Assigned to the Kursk front , he commanded the Second Ukrainian Army , which breached the German defenses and liberated Belgorod and Kharkov . In 1944 he won his greatest victory at Korsun-Shevchenkovsky , where in mud and blizzard his Soviet force encircled and destroyed ten German divisions . From there he went on to force the Dnieper , the Bug and the Dniester , and after liberating North Moldavia , his troops crossed Poland and became the first Russians to reach the Elbe , where his 58th Guards Division linked up with the U.S. 69th Division . Here Konev met General Bradley , presented him with a Cossack charger ( the name Konev is derived from kon , a stallion ) .
