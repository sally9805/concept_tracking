txt // AT ITS BEST , MILK IS OUR MOST VALUABLE AS WELL as our most expensive " protective food . " Potentially , it could raise the nutritional and health status of the American people to so high a level that the burdens of the physician , the public health officer , and the taxpayer would thereby be enormously lightened . In practice , shockingly little of milk 's magnificent nutritional and health-building potential has ever been used by this richest and most wasteful country in the world . The qualitative and quantitative wastes and losses of milk occur at every stage of the **46;807;TOOLONG sequence . They involve every dimension of the feeding problem , from the complex chemistry and biology of the soil to the equally labyrinthine complexities of pressure politics . None of these wastes and losses is inevitable ; none of the problems is insoluble . At some time , in some place , virtually every one of the wastes has been eliminated , every one of the problems has been solved . Which means that if we put our minds to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least in the not-distant future . Let us attempt to break this vital nutritional problem into its elements . Production In quantity of milk , and to some extent in its quality , especially with respect to vitamins A and D , the cow gives back at the udder loo // what is given to her in terms of feed and forage . Pastoral tribes have known this since the days of Abraham . As we saw in Chapter 7 , some of them time human conception and birth so that the stamina of mothers and babes may benefit by the strength the cow crops from the spring pastures . Winter milk is " thin , " and you accept this as one of the inevitable hardships of the season . You do n't know , because the milkman does n't tell you , that it would be entirely practicable to raise the vitamin A value of winter milk 50 per cent by feeding legume forages , and that this could probably be done without greatly increasing the cost of milk production . That goes for winter butter too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units per pound , but which could readily be raised to at least the present mean annual potency of 15,000 units per pound . One of the most shocking wastes that occurs in the handling of our milk production is the 200 million pounds of colostrum milk that are thrown away annually . Colostrum is the milk secreted by the cow immediately after she has had a calf . It contains approximately ten times as much vitamin A , three times as much vitamin D and riboflavin , and twice as much ascorbic acid as normal cow 's milk . This milk , so precious to the nutrition of the newborn animal , we have traditionally considered unfit for human consumption , although the Swedes and the Scotch make a pudding of it which they consider a delicacy . In studies extending over a period of fifteen years , Dr. Weston A. Price analyzed 20,000 samples of dairy products obtained from all over the world . He found the vitamin content lowest in the samples from the eastern and far western states , where the soil had been tilled the longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where soil and pasturage are highly mineralized . He also found a suggestive correlation with health department statistics ? the mortality from heart disease and pneumonia was lowest when the vitamin content of the dairy products was highest . In clinical experiments Dr. West found that high-vitamin butter containing both vitamin A and " Activator X " were effective in arresting the progress of tooth decay . Processing A quart of fresh unpasteurized milk contains a third of the adult // requirement of vitamin C. Pasteurization robs us every year of as much ascorbic acid as is contained in the entire citrus crop of the United States . It also robs us of some calcium , which pasteurization converts to unassimilable forms . Are these losses any longer necessary in order to ensure that milk may not serve as a carrier of such diseases as bovine tuberculosis , septic sore throat , scarlet fever , typhoid , diphtheria , and undulant fever ? Scarcely . Ideally , it should be possible to raise the standards of dairy sanitation and inspection sufficiently to make unpasteurized " certified " milk equally safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a section of the British medical profession is stoutly opposed to it . Assuming , however , that sanitary or economic considerations weigh in favor of pasteurizing all milk , certified or uncertified , this being the position of the U. S. Public Health Service , can present methods be improved so that more ascorbic acid is retained ? Dr. G. C. Supplee , Director of Research for the Borden Company , says " Yes . " Dr. Supplee told the National Nutrition Conference for Defense that the technological principles for conserving ascorbic acid during pasteurization are known ; it is merely a question of whether it pays to apply them . In addition to improving pasteurization , it will be necessary to de-aerate milk before it is shipped to the pasteurizing plant ? thereby saving from 25 to 40 per cent of the ascorbic acid that is now lost en route . It will also be necessary to use brown , nonactinic bottles because your milk as now bottled can lose one third of its riboflavin and one half of its ascorbic acid by exposure to sunlight ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark-covered box for the milkman . Dehydration of skim milk will doubtless play an increasing role in the release of the great nutritional potential of milk . Eighteen billion quarts of the American milk supply is used for butter . Because the expense of shipping skim milk is at present too high to be profitable , two thirds of the skim milk product of butter making is fed to domestic animals . It would be better , in the opinion of many nutritionists , if a considerable proportion of this skim milk reached human beings directly . Dr. A. J. Carlson , Professor of Physiology at the University of Chicago , says : The common view that the main value of milk is in the butter fat is an error . The other components ( proteins , salts , vitamins ) // found in the skim milk are at least as important for human nutrition as the milk fat ( cream and butter ) . . . The consumption by man in the form of fresh whole milk or condensed whole milk of all or nearly all the milk our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of better nutrition on a national scale . The total or partial dehydration of whole milk also promises major nutritional gains . Seemingly , the technical problems of conserving flavor and vitamins will soon be solved . Distribution Every day , from ten to thirty milk trucks roll down the typical American Main Street . That is one reason why 22 cents out of the consumer 's milk dollar must be charged to delivery . Another is the resistance of the milk drivers ' union to the introduction of two- , three- , and four-quart containers , which save consumers two to three cents a quart . Rural milk collection is also wasteful . In Colebrook , New Hampshire , 54 trucks , never loaded even at their peak season to more than two thirds of their capacity , collected milk from 314 farmers and delivered it to three dealers . Saybrook , Connecticut , had 16 milk dealers and actually needed only one . During the war , Milwaukee attempted with some success to streamline this absurdly wasteful system of milk distribution . Britain did much more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel by some 40,000,000 miles . If what interests us is getting good , cheap fresh milk to the consumer , there-is no more sense in plural milk collection and delivery routes than there is in plural telephone systems . Government experts think this , but do n't say it . It would help if consumer organizations said it more often and more loudly than they do . Theoretically , the fixing of milk prices to the producer and to the consumer is justified on the ground that such price-fixing by states and the Federal government is necessary to maintain adequate supplies of good milk . But as the work of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has shown , it does n't always work that way , the actual effect being to keep milk out of reach of the lowincome mothers and children who need it most , and to narrow the // market of the dairy farmer . A score of states now fix prices to both producer and consumer , and in most of them consumer organizations are complaining that the prices are too high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about the chronic butter-margarine controversy is simply : Is margarine , fortified with 9,000 units of vitamin A and selling for only a little more than half the price , a complete nutritional substitute for butter ? Part of the answer is still in the field of scientific controversy , but this much may safely be said : If fortified margarine does n't have everything that butter has , as it probably does n't , it still has-enough value nutritionally , and because of its relatively low cost , to deserve a more important place in our diet than it has hitherto had . This being the case , the public interest is not served by taxing margarine off the market , which is what the organized dairy interest has been trying to do , with more or less success , for the past century . As to the yowling catfight over which group of producers should have the right to color its product yellow , the proper answer , delivered by the consumer as he slams the window down and goes back to sleep , is a loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way from deep yellow in spring to pale cream in winter , with a roughly corresponding variation in its content of vitamin A. Theoretically and practically , the right answer would be to make both products stand and sell on their own natural colors and their own fully labeled nutritional content . The result would be that the quality of both butter and margarine would improve , with corresponding nutritional and health gains to the public . Certainly , if the state and federal margarine taxes are scrapped , the consumption of margarine will increase . But need the housewife who buys oleo instead of butter deprive her family of the nutritive elements , known or unknown , that butter contains and oleo does n't ? Not if she is careful at the same time to consume more whole milk in its various fresh , evaporated , and dehydrated forms , especially as technological advance reduces the nutritive losses in processing . // Nor will increased sale of margarine destroy the dairy industry ? not if the industry puts its own house in order , steps up the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic wastes and losses . // BETWEEN 1939 AND 1944 THE ANNUAL RETAIL DOLlar volume of the vitamin business mushroomed up from a million to over $250,000,000 ? an increase in five years of nearly 2,000 per cent . Of this amount , $200,000,000 worth was sold over drug and grocery store counters and by mail order houses in the form of capsules , pills , syrups , and elixirs . The armed services and the Red Cross bought $18,000,000 worth , mostly in the form of pills . The millers and bakers invested about $12,000,000 in the materials of the enrichment formula , and the margarine manufacturers paid $2,000 , - 000 for vitamin A. The remainder was purchased by animal-feed suppliers , and by miscellaneous manufacture ' of beer , breakfast foods , frankfurters , jams , jellies , candy , and what not . Seemingly the reductio ad absurdum of the fortification mania was achieved when a soft drink manufacturer announced a fizz water spiked with thiamin so that alcoholics might guzzle simultaneously their deficiency-creating liquor and its antidote . This practice seemed quite reasonable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face against the pane behind which the millers and bakers were exploiting the government-publicized flour and bread enrichment program . In 1943 a prominent sugar magnate suggested with bland smoking-car logic that sugar did n't io6 // need to worry about its lack of vitamins , since obviously the public was getting them elsewhere in the form of pills . But was there any assurance that the public was getting its money 's worth in health out of the quarter of a billion dollars it spent for pills , potions , and the vitamins that were being needled into staple foods ? One might suppose that somebody would have brought that up in the beginning . But , as noted in Chapter io , the flour and bread enrichment program had been promulgated almost without any preliminary foundation in the form of scientific investigation or " pilot plant " tryouts . And as for the vitamin manufacturers , they were counting their profits in millions long before the question had been adequately posed even to a jury of laboratory rats , let alone subjected to verification by human clinical experiments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By that time the camel of the synthetic vitamin business was thoroughly at home inside the tent of the American food economy , while nutritional science stood outside wringing its hands and viewing with alarm other hungry invaders such as the amino acid business that was already pawing at the tent ropes . There was good reason for hand wringing . In August 1943 two British physicians , Jenkins and Yudkin , reported their study of 178 eleven- and twelve-year-old school children . For a year , half this group were given daily A , B1 , C , and D vitamins , the control group receiving dummy pills . Examination at the end of the test period showed no difference between the two groups in respect to resting pulse rate , vital capacity , breath holding , and endurance . Physicians Jenkins and Yudkin note that because of improved nutrition British health during the war was better than ever before , and that " insistence on an adequate diet is better than supplementing a poor one with vitamin preparations , as these can never furnish all the factors needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported similar findings when 200 Duke University medical students and technicians were given vitamin , liver extract , and yeast tablets , the controls getting dummy pills containing inert materials . No essential difference was observed among the various groups in regard to appetite , energy , " pep , " general health , or weight . 1o8 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH AMERICAN FOOD ? In interpreting these findings , the authors of the experiment remark that while no one would question the employment of vitamin therapy in frank deficiency diseases or even in suspected deficiency states , still one wonders if the indiscriminate use of vitamins , sold over the counter to people who have no obvious disease , is justified . A year later , by which time the vitamin camel had added almost another hundred million dollars to its stature , the Council on Foods and Nutrition of the American Medical Association expressed a similar caution , although the Council in 1939 had cordially invited the camel inside the tent by approving the general principle of restoration and fortification with synthetics . Said the Council , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foods : ... A recognition of the importance of natural foods of both plant and animal origin in the maintenance of high standards of nutrition is paramount . It is necessary that the vast bulk of our diets in the way of carbohydrates , fats , and proteins must come from products of this type . While certain nutrients found in these foods may be prepared synthetically , nutritional knowledge is incomplete and unknown food factors undoubtedly exist which can be obtained only from natural food products . To say at this writing that nutritional knowledge is incomplete is almost to err on the side of understatement . It might well be added that if the lay public understood just how incomplete this knowledge is , how murky with unknowns , it would be more than a little terrified at the brash applications of the science to which it has already been subjected . For example , most nutritionists believe that although most of the quarter of a billion dollars we spent for vitamins in 1944 was wasted money , it did us little physical harm . But they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes clearer with every passing month of research , is that it is easier to overdose with vitamins than was originally supposed , and that in venturing off the safe ground of natural foods into the terra incognita of miscellaneous restoration , fortification , enrichment , and pill consumption of synthetic concentrates , we can rather easily develop serious dietary imbalances . In the treatment of acute deficiency diseases ? beri-beri , pellagra , scurvy ? the synthetic vitamins , used often in massive doses , have // fully demonstrated their usefulness . But even when prescribed by highly skilled and experienced clinicians , they are sometimes ineffective for a number of reasons . There are many more nutrients in natural foods than the synthesizers have synthesized , and the deficiency may arise from the lack of one or more of these natural unknowns . Usually , if not always , the patient is suffering not from one deficiency , but from several ; and always what is involved is a complex interrelationship of vitamins and minerals with a multiple number of other nutrient factors in which an overdose of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physiological behavior of the patient , conditioned by illness or perhaps a life-long addiction to devitalized processed foods , must be taken into consideration . This being the highly complex situation with which the physician has to deal , what chance has the average layman to prescribe successfully for himself ? In 1939 Dr. W. H. Sebrell , nutritionist of the United States Public Health Service , in condemning proposals to reinforce staple foods with vitamins as not only wasteful but possibly harmful , declared that , " we should not dismiss too lightly the possibility of harm from overdoses of vitamins . " Dr. Sebrell 's warning was fully justified at the time by the evidence that had already been accumulated by Spies , Brehm , and others , showing damage to the circulatory system and the kidneys caused by overdoses of vitamin D. Later research has confirmed these findings . Steinbock , the discoverer of the method by which a form of vitamin D is produced synthetically through the irradiation of viosterol , yeast , and milk , was the first to announce that irradiated viosterol is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter , incidentally , have been shown to differ greatly in their content of vitamin D , and damage through overdosage is easily possible even when the natural sources of vitamin D ( sunlight and the fish liver oils ) are used . The situation is further complicated by the role of vitamin D with respect to the calciumphosphorus balance . The toxic effect of too much vitamin A was shown by Takahashi as far back as 1922 . In 1934 Collaza and Rodriquez found that rats fed too much vitamin A exhibited the same symptoms as those fed too little , namely , inflamed eyes , decreased growth , and multiple spontaneous bone fractures . Later studies showed that hyper110 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH AMERICAN FOOD ? vitaminosis A occurred only in animals who were getting too little of vitamins B and C ? demonstrating the inescapable interrelation that exists between vitamins . It was long believed that prompt elimination of excess thiamin by the kidneys prevented any damage from excess dosage of this vitamin . In 1941 , however , Dr. Clarence A. Mills , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects produced by large overdoses of synthetic thiamin taken by workers in the tropical climate of Panama . About the same time Dr. Agnes Fay Morgan fed dogs on synthetic B vitamins in various quantities and combinations . Her findings indicated clearly the importance of the inter-relationship of the B-complex vitamins . In summarizing these findings Dr. Morgan emphasized that : Attention should be given to the possible danger of the administration of large amounts of certain vitamins such as nicotinic acid to persons subsisting on diets having multiple deficiencies . Fortification of foods with those vitamins such as thiamin or nicotinic acid which are available in large quantities may precipitate conditions worse than the subacute deficiency state produced by the usual diet balanced in its inadequacies . Improvement in all directions equally is essential . The daily thiamin requirement of the rat is 50 gamma , according to Barnet Sure . But when Dr. Sure doubled this supply he produced sterility in the second generation of his female rats . Again doubling the dose produced toxic effects in lactation in the third generation , and a daily dose of 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Few facts in nutrition are more securely established than that the sum of the known constituents of the vitamin B complex , when administered in synthetic form , do not produce anything like as good feeding results as the natural complex . In reporting in 1939 an experiment of this kind with chicks , Elvehjem noted that some improvement in growth was obtained with each added synthetic , but that normal growth was not achieved until a fair amount of the B vitamins obtained from natural foods such as liver , kidney , or yeast was added . He concludes that " synthetic vitamins should be used with caution in order to prevent the development of deficiencies more serious than the deficiency we set out to control . " // Not only must we allow for still unknown food factors each with a role still to be determined . There is also the crucial matter of the vital interrelationships between all these known and unknown food factors in the total nutritional process . If , in treatment , the synthetic vitamin does n't produce the same effect as the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or derived from a natural source , the clinician is usually safe in concluding either that some such vital interrelationship is involved or that the deficiency is caused by the lack of some new factor that has not yet been isolated and identified . This conclusion was strikingly demonstrated in the case of vitamin C , or ascorbic acid , which regularly fails to produce as good results in the treatment of scurvy as does lemon juice . Deciding that some other element must be involved , the famous Hungarian biochemist Szent Gyoergyi found it to be citrin , or vitamin P , which occurs in lemon juice and also in Hungarian pepper . Similar examples could be multiplied many times . The most that a restoration or " enrichment " program can achieve is a haphazard , approximate restoration of certain known deficiencies , always in ignorance of the role played by the still unknown nutrients , present in natural foods , which have been removed or destroyed from natural food during processing . Restoration or enrichment has no chance of re-creating the natural food patterns on which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every scientific test . No matter how conservatively the attempt at restoration or enrichment is conducted , it must run the risk of creating the kind of artificial imbalances to which Dr. Morgan and others have called attention . Once the principle of restoration or enrichment is accepted , then the nutritionist 's objection to the devitalization of processed foods is thereby weakened at the same time that vested commercial interests in synthetic restoration are created . It then becomes difficult to stop short of a complete commercially planned and dominated dietary in which synthetic vitamins , minerals , and perhaps amino acids , play an increasing role . Profit motivations then intensify the biologic wreckage already wrought by soil exhaustion . But not even the " biologic engineers " are ready for that , as they are uneasily aware . Thus far , nutritionists recognize that it is the complex , half-understood patterns of the natural foods that alone provide dependable norms for adequate or optimum nutrition , both in rats // and in humans . The very purity of the synthetics is itself a danger since no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word vitamin , is authority for the statement that they are less effective and more toxic than those occurring in natural food . Many other competent investigators subscribe to this opinion . The alternative to restoration is the retention in our staple foods of all the nutrients that nature put in them . That should in fact be our ultimate program if we wish to achieve optimum nutrition and obtain from food its maximum contribution to the public health at low cost . Anything short of this is makeshift and compromise , justifiable only if it is labeled as such . True , the achievement of this objective will take time , since it involves the unraveling and reorganization of much of our present food economy , together with corresponding changes in a whole complex of acquired food habits . These difficulties can easily be exaggerated , however , and the food processors who exaggerate them do so frequently , for interested reasons . The point to emphasize is that the nutritionists who have demanded the return to natural foods are neither food faddists nor radicals . Theirs is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritional policy must base itself cautiously on what is known and what can readily be proved , rather than on the whimsical , and too often selfish , direction of the food processors , who inadvertently kicked the bottom out of the national diet , to again make the American people the guinea pigs of a brash experiment of synthetic food fortification or " biological engineering . " This could easily worsen our condition rather than improve it . The danger would be considerably lessened if the lay public would put aside its reverence for the multiplying priesthood of nutritional science long enough to realize how recently it all started and how much it still has to learn . Hippocrates , the founder of medical science , believed that all food was alike , that there was a single " universal ailment " ; and this belief was expressed by American scientists as late as the early nineteenth century . Then , about a hundred years ago , modern analytical science started applying to food its characteristic method of taking the jigsaw puzzle apart , determining the composition and function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , the parts were defined as sugar , fat , and protein . Then , about // the middle of the last century , the list became protein , fat , carbohydrates , ash , and water ; and it was upon the basis of those classifications that Atwater in the eighteen-eighties recorded his classical analyses for the United States Department of Agriculture . Atwater 's measure of the value of the foods he analyzed was the calorie , and his estimate that an average person needs about three thousand of these host units a day is still accepted . It is only one of the measures , however , because the more the scientists worked on the jigsaw puzzle , the more its parts crumbled into smaller and smaller pieces , with more and more complex interrelationships . If one could visualize a speeded-up history of the science , it would be a little like sitting in a planetarium and watching the various universes picked out one by one and star by star in the electrical firmament above . The microcosm of the vitamins began emerging about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funk in England , Pekelharing , Eijkman , Grijns , and McCarrison in the Orient , and Osborne , Mendel , McCollum , Goldberger , and many others in this country . Vitamin B , first conceived as the single food entity whose lack caused beri-beri , turned out to be a whole microcosm of at least thirteen members , with more , almost certainly , to come . Williams ' brilliant feat of synthesizing vitamin Bl as thiamin placed a valuable weapon in the hands of clinical nutritionists ? and a dubious one in the hands of the food fortifiers . For thiamin is n't the sole and sufficient answer to clinical beri-beri or its subclinical manifestations of polyneuritis and lowered morale . Similarly , as Spies and others have shown , nicotinic acid ( niacin ) is not the sole and sufficient answer to pellagra . When it is remembered that we have been tinkering with the jigsaw puzzle of nutrition ? which means the basic puzzle of how organic life maintains itself ? for less than fifty years , is it so surprising that we have n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell Wilder has said , " We do not know how to improve on nature " ? After all , the operator of the planetarium attempts only to exhibit that part of the celestial mechanics which he understands , or thinks he understands . He knows and acknowledges that he does n't understand it all . And he certainly would n't attempt , in the absence of the cosmic regulator , to operate in new and improved ways the actual universe , for which his collection of electrical gadgets provides only a crude and partial simulacrum. // Similarly , we are a long way from being able to construct a complete synthetic diet even for rats , let along human beings , whose physiologies and nutritive requirements have been shown to be quite different in many respects . Fortunately , we do n't have to . The national diet can and should be founded on natural foods . When and if nature needs help , it should be given at the source : the culture of the soil , the plant , and the animal whence man derives his sustenance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RESTORATION CAN ONLY MARGINALLY RESTORE the original and fortification represents a foolhardy attempt to bet-ter nature , these devices would be highly dubious even if one were to regard our bad food habits and the vested commercial interests that pander to and perpetuate them as twin absolutes to which any nutritional program must be adapted . They are scarcely that . Even if one grants J. C. Drummond ? s observation that " earlier than the Odyssey there is a strong stream of perversion in man , " one must immediately add that there is also a strong strain of commercialism . Bad food habits are not immacu lately conceived as a kind of Original Anthropological Sin . They are a form of conditioned individual and group social behavior , as a result of which a lot of very poor people get beri-beri and pellagra and a few quite rich people make a lot of money . " The taste of the Proletariat , " remarks Lord Bledisloe , however nocuous , be-comes reflected in large scale industrial enterprise . " It has been competently estimated that three fifths or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods which are totally or seriously deficient in vitamins , minerals , and other essential nu trients . Are we really that perverse ? Given a free choice , no ani-115 // mal in the field or in the laboratory would deliberately select such a faulty diet . Are human beings uniquely deficient with respect to the self-regulatory functions of taste and selection that ensure the survival of animals ? How , then , has the human race survived ? For , as a distinguished student of animal psychology has pointed out : That we must have essentially the same ability as animals to make beneficial dietary selections is attested by our very existence . Certainly in the wild state , when man was dependent for his food on selections made from a great variety of nutritious , harmless and poisonous substances , he did not have the guiding hand of the modern nutritionist to help him select his diet . Appetite trust have been his chief guide then , and today appetite must still play a far more important role than many nutritionists seem willing to admit . Today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers on one of the most important frontiers of nutritional science . How can a food perversion or addiction , once established , be prevented from institutionalizing itself in the food culture and in the economy of food production and distribution ? How , in a producer-dominated and producer-oriented democracy , can a degenerative food culture be transformed and redirected in the interest of the biological survival of the individual and of the society ? Not until these questions are answered will we have really come to grips with the tremendous problem of establishing and maintaining a sound food policy for this country and for the world . For some years the rats in the laboratory of the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic of the Johns Hopkins Hospital at Baltimore have been proving their ability to choose a balanced diet without the help of national nutrition programs , advertising copywriters , home economists , dieticians , or nutritionists . True , the rats , unlike their human contemporaries , did not have to solve the economic dimension of the problem . They did not have to buy their rations . Nor were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high pressure salesmanship , by the competing attractions of a good diet and a new radio . On top of these advantages , however , they exhibited remarkable skill in selecting what they needed , in order to grow and reproduce , and in compensating for the various handicaps // which Dr. Curt P. Richter and his associates imposed upon them . When a group of rats were given a chance to select their own food from a collection of eleven substances constituting an adequate diet , they grew just as fast on fewer calories of food than the control group that was fed a stock diet . When deprived of the yeast that had supplied their B vitamins , they promptly compensated for this deprivation by increasing their consumption of fat and decreasing their consumption of carbohydrate and protein . Then , as the members of the vitamin B complex were restored one by one , they made appropriate adaptations of their fat , carbohydrate , and protein consumption . When pregnant or lactating , they sensibly increased their consumption of needed minerals : salt , sodium phosphate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fat , promptly eating much less when their babies were weaned . Their offspring were in fact produced much more efficiently than those of the rats on the stock diet , because in order to get enough minerals the latter had to eat larger quantities of food that otherwise would not have been needed . The conditioned behavior of abnormal rats confirms these findings . Deprived of his adrenal cortex , which regulates the sodium content of the blood , the rat will eat large quantities of salt , thereby keeping himself alive . Similarly , when his water balance is disturbed by the removal of the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland , the rat will compensate by drinking large amounts of water . Deprived of his pancreas , the rat eats and drinks hugely , to compensate for his inability to use carbohydrates . Diabetic rats need no diet schedules , but of their own volition choose large amounts of fat , and almost no carbohydrate . Wheat grown on the selenium-bearing soils of South Dakota has made human beings sick ? but not rats , or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat , one normal and the other containing the poisonous trace-element , they soon learn to reject the latter and will go hungry rather than touch it . Just as the physiologist can sometimes determine the function of a given gland by watching the behavior of a rat after its removal , so domestic animals can be used to detect soil deficiencies . Says Dr. William A. Albrecht of the Missouri College of Agriculture : Animals will recognize soil treatment effects too small to be recorded as weight differences , as well as improvements in the // crop quality lasting long after the soil treatment may have been forgotten . In Johnson County , Missouri , a farmer was startled to observe that when he turned his hogs loose in a cornfield , they carefully selected the corn on the limed section of the field , disdaining that growing on the unlimed section . By accident , another Missouri farmer drilled an extra dosage of superphosphate into a corner of his barley pasture . When the cattle were let into the field , they grazed the heavily phosphated section first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily and less heavily fertilized parts of the field was clearly marked . Even when grazing on virgin prairie , cattle will return to a small limed area , rather than graze the larger , more accessible , but less fertile prairie . In New South Wales , sheep were observed to cure themselves of anemia by eating the earth in certain paddocks . On analysis , the earth from those natural lick holes proved to be unusually rich in iron . In Victoria , Australia , horses supplement the deficiencies of their pasture by eating the bark of " grey-box " trees , which contain 53.7 per cent of lime as against only 2.7 per cent in the native grasses . Babies ca n't read or understand the radio commercials and have no social or religious prejudices . All of which seems to help in making them much better nutritionists than the average mother . Experiments by Dr. Clara M. Davis and Dr. Curt Richter have shown that when given a wide choice of foods and allowed to eat whatever they like , they balance their diets admirably over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on brief meat , egg , or sugar " jags . " One three-year-old child consumed nearly a pound of lamb at one sitting . But these excesses have no unfor-tunate consequences . The babies do n't have stomachache or con-stipation , and they invariably grow well . They even cure them-selves of rickets by feeding themselves phenomenal amounts of cod-liver oil . Dr. Richter found that almost all of his five-year-olds liked cod-liver oil , but that only 30 per cent of his fourteen-year-olds shared this appetite , this reduction corresponding to the diminished need of the body for vitamin D. Like the surgically conditioned rats of Dr. Richter 's laboratory , children and even adults exhibit a considerable ability to compenOUR // sate for organic defects . Children with parathyroid deficiency show a craving for chalk , plaster , and other substances with high calcium content . A **25;855;TOOLONG child with an adrenal tumor kept himself alive for two years by eating huge quantities of salt ? until his removal to the hospital , where the normal hospital diet promptly killed him . People with a seemingly abnormal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensating for a tendency to pernicious anemia . Diabetic patients automatically assist their impaired physiological balance by drinking large quantities of water . Poor whites in the South eat clay to cure their anemia . Pregnant Negro women with low hemoglobin levels travel long distances to gather " stump dirt " ? this being a kind of iron-bearing clay found where a large tree blows over and brings the subsoil to the surface . The lengths to which many primitive tribes go in the attempt to obtain needed food substances have been described in Chapter 4 . In these primitive food habits , we find the self-regulatory mechanisms of the individual physiology embodied in the custom and taboo of the tribe ; the food pattern of the group reinforces the uncorrupted animal instinct of the individual . Not , however , among all primitive tribes , for it must be remembered that on his travels Dr. Price encountered some primitives with bad food habits as well as many with extraordinarily good ones . In general , it may be said , however , that it is chiefly among civilized peoples ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " discretion " ? that the self-regulating mechanisms of natural appetite fail to function and that perverted food habits become institutionalized in the culture . Which comes first ? Is a whole pattern of food production , processing , and distribution built up to satisfy the perverted appetites of individuals in whom the self-regulating mechanisms of the good animal have become atrophied ? Or does the individual eat what the social and economic environment in one way or another persuades or forces him to eat ? until eventually he develops physiological perversions , aversions , and addictions that support and extend these pressures ? Actually , of course , what we see is a two-way process : a complex interaction of forces in which poverty and long-continued malnutrition , emulative social influences , the inertias of an established technological and distributive machinery , and the pressures of com120 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH AMERICAN FOOD ? mercial interests , implemented by advertising , all play important roles . The more complex the civilization , the easier it is for a food culture to go wrong . Being close to the soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate in terms of a longterm biological accountancy . Yet these centuries-old , bio-assayed food cultures have often been quickly destroyed by the impact of the technological continuum of western civilization , the latter being regulated by a short-term pecuniary accountancy . War , by accelerating the diffusion of cultures , may result either in an improvement or deterioration of food habits , depending in some degree upon the policy adopted by the military authorities . For example , in World War II , the armed forces of nearly every country at war , regardless of the prevailing civilian consumption habits , quickly adopted whole wheat or long extraction flour ? with the exception of our own Army and Navy . Instead of seizing the opportunity to recondition the more or less impaired appetite mechanism of the i i , 000,000 members of the armed forces , our military authorities continued their traditional use of white flour , being slow even to accept the enrichment program adopted for the civilian population . The result was that the Army not only weakened its own food front , but bedeviled the feeding problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the attraction of the G.I. 's white bread , and demanded it from UNRRA . Among the many admirable studies initiated by the Committee on Food Habits of the National Research Council , one of the most interesting was conducted in the Kips Bay-Yorkville area of New York City . Lectures , a food information center for the distribution of propaganda , a mobile kitchen , and nutrition luncheons given by neighborhood women for their friends ? all were tried in the effort to improve the food habits of the **27;882;TOOLONG German , Italian , Irish , Hungarian , and other **27;911;TOOLONG immigrant families living in the slum areas of the district . Yet the results were depressingly meager . On the whole , and for reasons that seemed to them sufficient , the Yorkville **26;940;TOOLONG immigrant families rather preferred malnutrition . " We came to America to better ourselves , " said one slum mother . " Why should we go back to eating only vegetables and dark bread ? We had that when we were poor in Europe . " // Another tenement dweller , when her attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogan : " You must eat these 5 foods for health , " declared indignantly : My mother raised her family ? I have five children and they are all healthy , and I raised them the way my mother taught me . Why should I change ? Do these people know more than my mother ? Not only did the government nutritionists have to fight the ignorance and inertia of simple people . Even more important , as the record clearly shows , was the fact that the whole food economy of the Yorkville area was organized against them . Over half the women who were asked why they did not use the food information center replied that they were getting their information from the grocer , the chain store , the newspaper , or the radio . And much of the time , of course , all these educational agencies had a considerable vested interest in the bad food habits that the nutritionists were trying to change . But good food habits can also be made to yield a profit to the food advertiser and his allies , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations that depend upon his advertising . Within certain limits it is entirely practicable to create new food habits both good and bad . For example , shortly before World War I the California and Florida citrus growers , in order to dispose of burdensome surpluses , started to convert the American people to the orange juice-for-breakfast habit . By World War II they had expended tens of millions in advertising ? and expanded the citrus market by 300 per cent . Fortunately , the orange juice habit , contributing as it did a much needed addition of vitamin C to the American diet , is a good habit . But if it had been a bad habit , would the orange growers and their advertising allies have stayed their hands ? The cola and other soft drink habits , by adding deleterious quantities of caffein and sugar to the diet , contribute appreciably to our national malnutrition . During the years 1939-43 , one company alone spent $22,000,000 for magazine , newspaper , and radio advertising , thereby providing these commercial instruments of social communication with a vested interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by every reputable nutritionist . Among the most extraordinary triumphs of American business // are the breakfast food empires created toward the end of the last century out of emasculated cereals , air , water , cellophane , and advertising . Establishment of these empires involved the approximate liquidation of our grandmothers ' nutritionally sound habit of buying oatmeal ? as oatmeal ? by the pound or the barrel from the grocer and whole corn grits or wheat from the local water mill . This cost the American people a good deal of health , as well as a good deal of money , and will continue to do so , especially now that the application of the enrichment program to prepared breakfast cereals has given them a new lease on life . In any sane food culture , the elders of the tribe would force every food to pay off in terms of both price and nutritional content ? and slap a taboo on it if it did n't . No amount of needling with synthetic vitamins , minerals ? and perhaps next amino acids ? will make the fantastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the Food Habits Committee of the National Research Council has failed to investigate the origin , nature and modus operandi of these and other contemporary achievements in what might be called creative anthropology . This is unfortunate because even a superficial survey would seemingly yield much enlightenment to the social scientists and to the public administrators and statesmen whom they serve . For example : although the machinery of public education is supported by public funds , the producer interest in food has come to regard this machinery too as its property . Hence , when in the nineteen-thirties the milling and baking industries found that a score of elementary school texts in physiology contained favorable references to whole wheat bread , they were horrified . Steps were taken to suppress this heresy and to provide without charge , for the use of teachers and home economists , suitable pamphlets , charts , and other educational material setting forth the industry-approved doctrine . Since school budgets are chronically inadequate and since the business men who serve on school boards may ordinarily be relied upon to take a sympathetic view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in recent years come to provide much of the content of the nutritional education furnished by elementary school teachers and home economists . Producer co-operatives , food processors , and kitchen appliance manufacturers all provide educational pamphlets , charts , graphic aids , // and the like , for use in schools . There is scarcely a major food corporation in America that does not attempt to use the school system to promote its products . In December 1942 the Grade Teacher , a reputable professional publication serving the elementary school teachers of America , undertook to further the National Nutrition Program of the Office of Defense Health and Welfare Services . To this end it listed " 46 tools with which to fashion better food habits in America 's youth , " most of which were offered to teachers free for the asking . Significantly , of these " 46 tools , " consisting of pamphlets , charts , and graphic aids , only twelve were issued by government bureaus such as the Department of Agriculture or Public Health , the Children 's Bureau , and the Federal Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by food and kitchen appliance manufacturers or producer co-operatives . A total of 454,840 pieces of this educational literature were ordered by the teachers , for use in their classrooms . Of this number only 19,384 pieces were government material . A single pamphlet issued by the National Association of Grocers and Manufacturers scored 150,733 requests . Requests were received for 146,026 copies of the Kellogg Company 's Health from Day to Day and for 82,371 copies of Swift and Company 's Meat Makes the Meal . Although some of this commercially sponsored " education " is dubious or definitely damaging , most of it is factually accurate as far as it goes and all of it is printed and illustrated much more attractively than the government literature ? which is probably one of the reasons why the teachers prefer it . Obviously , there is something wrong with this picture , what is most wrong being its uncritical acceptance by the average educator , home economist , and nutritionist . What has happened is that by permitting the use of commercially sponsored food propaganda in the schools we have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commercial interests that are concerned primarily not with improving the national diet , but with advancing the sales of their products and with influencing food habits to that end . And since the even more important instruments of social communication ? the press and radio ? are similarly controlled , we are scarcely in a position to implement a sane national food policy even if we had one . // If an anthropological expedition encountered this situation in the South Seas or among some blubber-eating Arctic tribe , it would be labeled a " cultural configuration , " and once safely pigeonholed , the anthropologists would have no trouble whatever in perceiving that the mores of the unfortunate savages were in a bad way . Since when has it become biologically safe for a people to delegate the control of its food culture to profit-seekers who assume no responsibility whatever for the survival of the tribe ? Moses knew better than that four thousand years ago , and so does many a statesmanlike and responsible Polynesian medicine man today . Did the Jewish patriarch permit any " educational " trifling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or advertisers ? Not Moses . The food God of the chosen people was a jealous God . In matters involving the survival or extinction of the tribe , Moses was willing to trust neither the selfregulating appetite mechanisms of the food consumer , nor the honesty of the food dealer . The Mosaic law is not perfect from the point of view of the modern sanitarian and nutritionist : neither are many other primitive food cultures , ancient and modern . They were and are good enough , however , to ensure the health and survival of the tribe . And their great merit is that they are set above the pecuniary accountancy of the market place and bulwarked by the highest social and religious sanctions . Compared to these enlightened primitives , we exhibit , in the codeless and planless chaos of our food economy and culture , a very special kind of civilized lunacy for which we have already paid heavily in biologic terms , and for which , in the nature of the case , we shall not find it easy to substitute order and sanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE MIDDLE NINETEEN-THIRTIES , THE need for synthesis of the nutritional , agricultural , technological , and economic dimensions of the food problem had become apparent to leading specialists in all of these fields . Such a synthesis was attempted by the establishment of the United States Plant , Soil , and Nutrition Laboratory at Cornell University , announced in a rather colorless release dated November 5 , 1939 as a research project , designed to discover ways and means of increasing the nutritional value of foodstuffs produced on American farms through studies of soil and crop management , soil types , and plant and animal nutrition , has been undertaken by the Department of Agriculture in cooperation with several research agencies . The investigations will center at Cornell University , Ithaca , New York , but they will extend throughout the United States . Later , after some thirty scientists had been assembled under the leadership of Dr. L. A. Maynard , a nutritionist of international reputation , the Laboratory , in an official memorandum , became somewhat more explicit about what it was up to . Our natural food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) soil which has become poorer through repeated cropping without the restoration of fertility , through erosion , and other factors ; ( 2 ) manufacturing , preserving , cooking , and other 127 // processes which have robbed our natural food supply of many of its important dietary constituents . The development of the " protective food " industry to meet the deficiencies in our modern diet has not kept in mind the nutritional goal . The protective foods are grown more for market quality , for increased yield , and for their keeping qualities rather than for their nutritional quality . The U. S. Nutrition Laboratory will give particular attention to the mineral and vitamin content of our food supply . It will map the areas of mineral deficiency throughout the United States as indicated by deficiencies in the soil , deficiencies in the plants , and the occurrence of nutritional disease in man and animals . It will strive by various cultural methods , including breeding practices , to step up the nutritive values of our food crops . Since the thirteen minerals required in human and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but one of the many vitamins which are required are plant products , the importance of the proposed program of this Laboratory is obvious . Obvious , indeed , one would have thought . Perhaps the dangers to vested food-producing and - processing interests , inherent in any such streamlined soil-to-consumer investigation , were in fact ' oo obvious to the " information industry " that is dependent upon these interests for its support . For neither at its inception nor later , as more and more significant findings accumulated , did the Laboratory receive anything like the attention that it merited . The result was that a kind of revolution in progress ? or in potential ? has for years lived a kind of underground life in the laboratories of our food scientists , and in the pages of their technical journals . The principal storm center of challenge and discovery lies in the misty mid-region where nutrition and soil chemistry meet . Leaders of the revolution are plant physiologists , agronomists , geologists , nutritionists , food technicians , soil chemists , plant breeders , and geneticists ? not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small fraction of the vast program of soil , plant , and nutrition research now under way is being done at the Laboratory . Almost every agricultural experiment station in the country is busy on some aspect of it . The 1934 ? 44 report of the Office of Experiment Stations of the USDA lists nearly a thousand separate projects , many of which are related directly or indirectly to the same ultimate objective as that of the Laboratory , which is the // functionalization of our whole food economy , all the way from the farm to the kitchen . In addition , most of our universities are occupied with similar research , some of it supported by grants from food processors and from the Nutrition Foundation , Inc . In effect , what is happening is that at the initiative and under the direction of government and with the help and co-operation of food processors whose businesses are continuously threatened by their findings , the food scientists of the nation are valiantly tugging at the bootstraps of our whole food economy and culture . The research starts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visitor is shown a remarkably unattractive , melancholy , and embittered white rabbit . " Here , Bowie , " calls the young , blonde , and strictly scientific laboratory assistant . Sniffing distrustfully , the martyr to science rises on his incredibly bowed legs and peers pathetically through his bleared eyes . " Is n't he wonderful ? " exclaims his custodian . " He 's probably the only pure manganese-deficient rabbit in the world . It takes a lot of trouble to develop a reliable measuring stick like that . " The Laboratory is manufacturing many such measuring sticks , both animal and plant . Directly and indirectly , they are being used to appraise the primary factor of our whole food economy , which is the soil . A geological happenstance to begin with , our American soils have been considerably modified by the human use and abuse to which they have been subjected . Hence , many if not most American soils exhibit deficiencies that affect the growth and nutritional value of the crops planted on them . In turn , the animals supported by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastures and the babies that drink the milk from these cows ? may be affected adversely by these deficiencies . Fourteen elements are definitely known to be required for normal plant development . They are : carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , phosphorus , potassium , calcium , magnesium , sulphur , iron , manganese , boron , copper , and zinc . Animals require all of the above elements except boron , and in addition they have been shown to need varying quantities of sodium , chlorine , iodine , and cobalt . There are seven mineral undesirables ; selenium , thallium , 1 30 THE TOOLS OF LIBERATION fluorine , chromium , lead , and arsenic . Under certain conditions of soil and climate , microscopic quantities of these elements may bring about the poisoning of both animals and man . The crossword puzzle of the soil would be difficult enough if it were merely a matter of adding and subtracting these factors . But it is far more complicated than that . A soil may contain an actual surplus of a given element ? phosphorus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to use . A surplus of available phosphorus in wet weather may become a deficiency during a drought . Excessive liming or unbalanced fertilization may create a deficiency where none existed before , by bringing about undesired chemical reactions and fixing a needed element in unavailable forms . Some of the trace elements like boron seem to be essential in microscopic quantities . But raise the boron content just a little higher ? to a few parts to a million in most soils , and much less than that in the sandy coastal plain soils ? and this mineral Dr. Jekyll becomes a poisonous Mr. Hyde . We discovered that as far back as World War I , when a shipment of fertilizer high in borax destroyed a whole potato crop . There are special mineral-plant affinities , too , which strain both the patience of the investigator and the credulity of the layman . The poison vetch , the weedy aster , and the Russian thistle all absorb large quantities of selenium and thrive on it , whereas most of the grasses will have none of it . Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical to go into , it is the Laboratory 's job , under the direction of Dr. Kenneth Beeson , to conduct a census of our American soils ? or to put it in the more realistic and practical terms that have been dictated by the size of the task , a census of our soil troubles . That 's where Bowie , the manganese-deficient rabbit , comes in . He 's a made-to-order census taker ? one of the many artificially sickened animals which Dr. S. E. Smith , animal physiologist , and Dr. G. H. Ellis , biochemist , are producing so that , among other uses , they may be employed in locating sick soils . In this scientific G-man hunt , the photographs of the unfortunate Bowie and his shortened and crippled legs are published in technical publications and bulletins along with photographs of mineral-deficient plants . Such " pilot " animal and plant photographs play a role somewhat similar to the photographs of criminals and their finger prints that // are tacked up on the bulletin boards of crossroad post offices . Somewhere a county agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study these exhibits and see a great light . That rabbit ? does n't he look a good deal like the bowlegged litter Joe Lobelia 's kid has been trying to raise ? Those stunted , yellow-leaved tomato plants ? are n't they just like the ones that so dismally failed to fruit on that ten-acre tract of leached , sandy soil Joe plowed up last year ? Now we come to the payoff . Because the county agent is now in a position to diagnose Joe 's trouble promptly and accurately , he is able to treat it successfully . Next year Joe will add to the fertilizer that goes on his land 50 pounds to the acre of manganese sulphate . As a result Joe will get a crop and start paying off the mortgage . But that is only a beginning . Observing Joe 's experience , other truck growers in the area will be able to correct this and other deficiencies in their soil . They may even take to reading a remarkable technical symposium entitled Hunger Signs in Crops , published jointly by the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes and illustrates in color a dozen major deficiency symptoms exhibited by cereals , cotton , tobacco , citrus and deciduous fruits , and staple truck crops . By applying what they learn in this book , a lot of dirt farmers have saved themselves a lot of grief and a lot of money . They 've learned how to prevent ? with a few pounds of boron per acre ? the internal core of apples , the top rot of tobacco , the cracked stem of celery , the heart rot and dry rot of beets . Minute quantities of zinc will prevent citrus mottled leaf and pecan rosette . Small additions of magnesium to the fertilizer have enabled the potato farmers of Maine and Long Island and South Jersey to prevent chlorosis of the leaf and thereby to raise bigger and more dependable annual crops . The correction of magnesium deficiency has also prevented the " sand drown " of tobacco . Sometimes the symptoms of a deficiency appear to by-pass the plant and affect only the animal that eats the plant . An outstanding example of this phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layman knows only that it is mined somewhere in Canada and is used in making paint . The cobalt story starts a century or two ago , when a dairyman of Dartmoor , England , reported that his cows pined and sickened when pastured in a certain field , but recovered when moved to an // adjoining pasture . Subsequently this mysterious " pining sickness " was reported in New Zealand , where it was called " Morton Mains " disease , from the district where it was prevalent ; in West and South Australia and near-by islands , where it was called " Coast disease " or " Coastiness . " Sheep suffering from this malady died by the hundreds and could be saved only by being driven inland to new pastures . In Scotland and in Kenya Colony , Africa , cattle and sheep growers reported a disease they called " Nakuritis . " Animals suffering from this ailment became listless and lost weight ; their tongues and noses became pale ; they gnawed at fence rails and ate dirt . Reading accounts of this malady in British scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cows in Michigan 's northern counties acted similarly ; also cattle grazing the scant pasture of certain gray sand districts in Florida , where the disease was called " salt sickness " and is described in the earliest agricultural records . Fifty years ago the Florida Agricultural Experiment Station started a systematic investigation of this condition . The Florida scientists were not alone , however , for by this time the hunt was out all over the world . In 1930 two teams of New Zealand soil chemists , Filmer and Underwood , Marston and Lines , working independently , put the finger on cobalt deficiency as the probable cause of the disease that was costing sheep and cattle growers thousands of dollars annually . Today , cobalt deficiency is no longer a problem , once it is identified . A " pining " sheep will recover completely if administered a daily dose of a tenth of a milligram of cobaltous sulfate ? about enough to put on the head of a pin . A cobalt-deficient pasture can be made to support healthy stock if it is given only 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identification of the disease still is n't too easy . Both in Florida and in parts of Australia , cobalt deficiency appears to be associated with copper and iron deficiencies , so that supplements of all three may be necessary for a cure . In Florida there appear to be different kinds of " salt sickness , " each due to a different set of soil deficiencies . Cobalt is an essential animal food ? at least for cattle and sheep . Selenium , on the other hand , acts as a poison in quantities no greater than two parts in a million . The selenium story goes back to the days when General Custer // was fighting the Sioux warriors in the Bad Lands of South Dakota and near-by areas of Montana and Wyoming . In 1857 Dr. T. C. Madison in a report on sickness and mortality in the army , described a " very serious disease " which afflicted the cavalry horses at Fort Randall , in what was then the Nebraska territory . When grazed in certain areas , the horses ' manes and tails became mangy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trouble , thought Dr. Madison , was due to the pasturage . The army doctor was right , but it took a long time to prove it . For a while most of the investigators suspected that the disease was caused by alkali in the water . Not until 1928 did the South Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station prove ? by feeding rats on wheat grown in the affected area ? that the disease was caused by what the horses and cattle ate . When the wheat that poisoned the rats was analyzed , it proved to contain 10 to 12 parts of selenium to the million , whereas nontoxic wheat from Maryland and Virginia contained almost none . During the past decade a series of surveys has revealed that the selenium problem is more serious than was at first supposed . Toxic areas have been located in several counties of Montana . A recent study has disclosed the existence of an enormous area of seleniferous soil in Canada . In Mexico , selenium was established as the cause of a Zoo-year-old disease of cattle and horses that occurs near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vegetables bought in the public market of Irapuato were found to contain up to 7o parts per million of selenium , undoubtedly a contributing cause of the ill health suffered by the people in the area . One of the principal long-term projects in which the Laboratory is engaged is an attempt to step up our intake of Vitamin Bl . The Laboratory has its own long-term approach to the problem of strengthening our staff of life . Its idea is to go back of the baker and the miller ? in fact , all the way back to the chromosomes of the wheat seed and the soil and climate in which it is grown . Wheat and other cereals vary almost as much in their essential nutritive constituents as do the " protective " fruits and vegetables . Recently Dr. K. C. Hamner of the Laboratory staff , working in collaboration with Dr. H. H. Love , specialist in plant breeding at the Cornell College of Agriculture , analyzed three thousand samples of wheat , gathered from nearly every wheat-producing area in America // and Canada , and representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this study : first , that all the varieties of wheat proved to be high in thiamin when grown in some areas and low in others ; second , that a high thiamin variety is relatively high no matter where it is grown . The eventual application of such studies is apparent . Why bother to enrich white flour and white bread with synthetics when by starting with a wheat high in thiamin , protein , and other essential nutrients , and using a " long extraction " process that will still yield an acceptably white or creamy flour , we can achieve our nutritional objective more completely , more dependably , and less expensively ? It should be remembered , too , that Dr. Love and other plant breeders have n't yet contributed their quota to this objective . On the basis of Dr. Hamner 's findings , wheat breeders everywhere will soon be selecting high thiamin wheats as " parents " for future breeding . And judging from past experience , it wo n't be long before new wheat hybrids , considerably higher in thiamin than the best existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other agricultural experiment stations . Similar improvements may be expected with respect to oats , corn , and other cereals ; also the major vegetable and fruit crops of commerce . As a matter of fact , we could , if we liked , step up the vitamin and mineral intake of the nation very considerably without waiting for the plant breeders . All we would have to do is to increase the production and consumption of existing high vitamin and high mineral varieties . For example , a Northern Spy apple contains five times as much vitamin C as a Mackintosh , although the latter is the more popular variety . Different varieties of onions , cabbage , tomatoes , and many other vegetables exhibit differences of vitamin C content ranging over a hundred per cent ; they exhibit almost equally wide differences in their content of other vitamins . Variations in the mineral content of cereals , fruits , and vegetables depend upon the soil . Wheat grown on the phosphatic limestone soils of Deaf Smith County , Texas , contains four to six times as much phosphorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray sand of certain districts in Florida ? the same districts where graze the " salt-sick " cattle already described ? are deficient in iron . The children who eat these greens are deficient in iron , too , as // Dr. Ouida D. Abbott of the Florida Experiment Station proved in a much-quoted study . Climate is the third factor that the Cornell scientists are studying . In 1943 Drs . Lyon , Beeson , and Ellis grew turnip plants in a control room under accurately regulated quantities of fluorescent light . Normal summer sunlight provides light of about 5,000 footcandle power . Plants given this amount of light in the greenhouse produced leaves which , when analyzed , yielded 233.5 milligrams of ascorbic acid per hundred grams . When provided with light of only 800 foot-candles the ascorbic acid promptly dropped to 84 milligrams per hundred grams ? about a fifth as much . These findings were corroborated by the discovery that tomato plants grown in the greenhouse in the fall and winter produced fruit with one half as much ascorbic acid as that contained in plants grown outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow our tomatoes only under conditions of maximum sunlight ? Yes , until such time as the plant breeders succeed in producing a variety of tomato that yields a maximum of ascorbic acid , whether grown under high or relatively low light intensities . Meanwhile , Dr. Maynard , in reviewing these and other experiments , has suggested that standard specifications for our daily vitamin C requirement , expressed in terms of tomatoes , had better specify whether summer- or winter-grown tomatoes are meant . The net of all this is quite simple : healthy soils and favorable climates grow healthy plants , which produce healthy domestic animals and healthy people . And vice versa . Especially vice versa , since after two centuries of soil mining and resultant water and wind erosion in this country , our super-soils are few and our deficient soils are many . How many ? Nobody knows . There are some 2,000 recognized soil types in the United States , distributed over 375 million acres of arable land . We know a good deal about certain deficiencies in a few areas . We know very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many other areas . We know almost nothing about millions of acres from which comes a substantial part of the foodstuffs eaten by our people . About the relation between sick soils and sick people we know least of all . Our scientists know enough , however , to answer the question // most likely to be asked by the readers of this chapter , which is : " Do these soil deficiencies and soil poisons have any serious bearing on my health or that of my family ? " The answer , in the judgment of those most qualified to speak , is a sobering " Yes . " It is entirely probable writes Dr. Beeson that the value of a minimum diet of protective foods may be reduced significantly below the minimum requirement through the use of inferior foods ... The problem is intensified because of the location of our large cities and of our truck farms that supply these cities with food . Most of our large cities are located on the well-leached podsols and podsolic soils that are acid in reaction and low in the bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities on the same soils and large quantities of truck crops and fruits are shipped to these cities from localities where nutritional disorders due to mineral deficiencies in the soils have been noted in both humans and animals . It certainly remains the duty of the agriculturist concludes Dr. Beeson to supply for at least the protective portion of the diet a food of the highest nutritional quality . That , in brief , is the assignment as the scientists stationed at the U. S. Plant , Soil , and Nutrition Laboratory and the Cornell School of Nutrition see it . At once breathtaking in scope and wholly practicable as to methods and objectives , the work of the Laboratory has cost the taxpayer , in the three years of its existence , approximately $300,000 . That is almost as much as Hollywood spends in getting ready to shoot a bigtime musical . // AND EVANGELISTS AGRICULTURE , LIKE MEDICINE , IS A SCIENCE TROUbled by schisms and heresies . Although history teaches us that the " charlatans " of yesterday are sometimes , as in the case of Pasteur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never take kindly to these annoying people ; even though their very errors , by stimulating the adrenals of the more judicious , may bring rebuttals and so indirectly serve the cause of truth . Naturally a journalist and a physician can not presume to judge for the reader the merits or demerits of the current disturbers of the academic peace of the agricultural experiment stations . It seemed desirable , however , to include in this book some account of their heresies , because they have captured the popular interest and imagination of a considerable number of earnest workers . It would be unfair to deny them a hearing . It is perhaps significant that all three of the contemporary agricultural heretics sketched in this chapter are synthesizers who proclaim the unity of the natural order ; for whom the enemy is the inertia of our thinking , the fragmentation of the scientific disciplines , and the unequal development of the natural and social sciences which constitute by general admission the central problem of our era . X37 // For all these heretics our rigidly institutionalized segregation of soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural economics from health economics ? all these habitgrooved divisions ? are artificial and defeating . For them the building of health is a single , positive science that starts with the soil ; ' that includes all the sciences and technologies having to do with the growing , processing , and distribution of food ; that points toward newer and wiser adaptations by man to the natural environment he has done so much to disturb and deplete . This , more especially , is the central thesis of Sir Albert Howard , by all odds the best-equipped and most formidable of the agricultural innovators here considered . Although it is true that orthodox agricultural science , like orthodox medical science , does not oppose this synthesis , it is perhaps also true that neither has sufficiently emphasized its present importance to the world . The Faulknerian Heresy In the summer of 1939 , while Hitler was preparing the catastrophe that was to destroy the soil , crops , and populations of Europe , a disaffected Middle Western county farm agent suddenly leaped from the furrow of his official servitude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which for years he and all the other county agents in America had been teaching their clients , were dead wrong . Getting himself a precarious economic stance as an insurance agent , the heretic undertook in his free time some experimental gardening designed to test this suspicion . During the next four years he accumulated enough field evidence to warrant the publication in 1943 of a thin but explosive volume entitled Plowman 's Folly . Time hailed Edward H. Faulkner 's contribution as " one of the most revolutionary ideas in agricultural history . " With an almost equal lack of reservation , many of the leading agronomists of America called it , in effect , " bunk . " It took nearly a year to establish the truth of the matter , which runs approximately as follows : It is true that the moldboard plow has been misused and overused , especially on certain types of soil . Hugh H. Bennett , chief of the Soil Conservation Science of the U. S. Department of Agriculture , had been saying as much for years . // It may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , fertilized solely by disking in cover crops with a disk harrow . Mack Gowder , a dirt farmer of Hall County , Georgia , was doing the same thing long before Plowman 's Folly was published , using not the disk harrow , but a soil-scratching device of his own contriving called the " bull tongue scooter . " For years Gowder 's yields of corn and wheat averaged twice those of his neighbors . It is most improbable , however , that the general application of Faulkner 's methods would multiply the present volume of agricultural production by five , or ten , as he suggested in his book . On the contrary , experiments at the Wisconsin Experiment Station showed from 16 to 32 per cent greater yields of corn and wheat with plowing than with surface tillage . For many years the American people have been told that a thin rind of surface soil , nearly half of which has already been destroyed by the erosion of wind and water , is all that stands between us and starvation . Our annual losses of essential minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons , to which must be added another twenty million tons removed by grazing and the harvesting of crops . Faulkner 's essential heresy consists in saying , " So what ? " to this frightening fact . Soil , insists Faulkner , can be remade in a few seasons without the help of artificial fertilizers , upon the residual subsoil of acres that have been considered hopelessly eroded and wornout . All that is necessary is to stop turning the soil upside down with the moldboard plow , thereby causing it to erode . Instead , we need only to mix cover crops into the soil surface . When this is done by all farmers , according to the Faulkner formula The pastures of the land will be greener , literally . Crops will grow in better fashion , with immeasurably less attention than they have customarily been given in the past ; the vitamins and minerals our foods used to contain in abundance will again be present in similar measure ; and in consequence we shall undoubtedly be healthier ; some of the tensions of civilization will be relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pleasant picture , and on the whole we may be grateful to Mr. Faulkner for painting it . Thereby he has not only furthered his own fortunes but raised the blood pressure of orthodox agronomists , a perhaps not undesirable thing ; more important , he has as140 THE TOOLS OF LIBERATION sembled large popular audiences which have heard not only the Faulknerian heresy but its refutation from the lips of more experienced if less lyric students of the soil . These critics agree that the plow has its faults but doubt that its abandonment would open up the high road to plenty toward which the ecstatic Faulkner beckons us . The judgment of these more earth-bound critics is best summed up by Professor Emil Truog , head of the soils department of the Wisconsin College of Agriculture : What is needed writes Dr. Truog is not a will-o ' - the- wisp formula for crop production , but proper education based on the great fund of sound practical and scientific information now at hand . By properly applying this information as interpreted by our crop production specialities , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time follow systems of soil management which will conserve our soils indefinitely for future generations . There need never be a famine here even though the population doubles in numbers . Back to Goethe If the plow is not the devil , then perhaps the compost heap is God ? Dr. Steiner thought so , and Dr. Steiner was a great man of a sort , as was assuredly his master , Goethe . Thus it follows that Dr. Steiner 's disciples , for two generations in Europe and America , have been successfully , if rather expensively , raising cereals and vegetables of high quality with compost fertilization alone , disdaining the chemical fertilizers which seemingly they consider tainted by the technological breath of the Evil One . Like Faulkner , the " biodynamic " farmers have done a good deal to raise the blood pressure of the chemical fertilizer industry . But because they have been at it longer and attracted to their movement some genuinely accomplished farmers and agricultural scientists , they have explored much more thoroughly and serviceably than has Faulkner that part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be saved a good deal of embarrassment if only it could be proved that there never was any such person as Dr. Rudolph Steiner ; or , lacking that , if he could be neatly labeled as a mystical charlatan and forgotten . Unhappily , neither method of disposal is in the least feasible . The record shows , beyond question , that Rudolph Steiner was born in 1861 , the precocious child of the railway station agent in an AusHERETICS // trian village close to the border of Hungary and Yugoslavia . He was an accomplished geometrician at eight and at thirteen had mastered Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason . After attending the Technical High School in Vienna , he took his doctor 's degree in natural sciences at the University of Vienna . Beginning in 1890 he spent seven years in editing the scientific writings of Goethe . At the age of 36 he briefly became head of the German branch of the Theosophical Society and editor of Magazin fur Litteratur . At this point , even though in 1907 he broke with the Theosophists and founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible hand had firmly and completely removed Dr. Steiner and his works from the subsequent knowledge of men . Thereafter , until the day of his death in 1925 , his career was at once obscure and notorious , public and isolated ; illumined by a genial and effortless integrity of mind and spirit , and clouded by the inadequacies of followers who frequently appeared to have understood neither themselves , nor Steiner , nor the dazzling synthesis of science and religion which he strove during thirty years of incredible industry to construct . The catalogue of Steiner 's published works is alone enough to fill a considerable volume . He wrote endlessly and apparently simultaneously in the fields of the natural and social sciences , politics , religion , art , and the humanities . At intervals he would pause and give sudden birth to whole new systems ; a new dance form , eurythmy , a new style of architecture , new theories of music and optics and education , not to mention new mystical cosmologies . The latter always contained a strain of original thinking , thereby differing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take over as a suite . Not even the drama escaped the all-embracing reach of his genius , at once pedestrian and inspired . At one period he wrote four blank verse Mystery Plays ; they are as inept and naive as so many Sunday School tracts . At his death , Kenneth D. MacKensie wrote in the English Contemporary Review : The work he has done is so immense that it is really very hard to grasp its extent ; nobody could keep up with him . He was at least a hundred years ahead of his time , a fate from which other philosophers have suffered ; hence the isolation in which he worked . . . // From Goethe , Steiner derived the conviction that organic life does not spring from the inorganic , as Darwinism would have it , but rather the reverse . Seemingly , Steiner 's contributions to agricultural science stem from this early conviction . As in every other field that he touched , Steiner 's work in agriculture was at once completely unorthodox and quite literally stimulating . The numbered plant extracts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biodynamic farmers use to hasten the ripening of their compost heaps , to stimulate plant growth , and to reduce insect infestation ? are all made from directions left by Dr. Steiner . Orthodox teachers of agronomy snort at the idea that such witches ' brews can have any effect , and refuse to examine the considerable evidence that they do , which has been amassed by adepts of the movement . Both the theory and the practice of biodynamic farming bring it extraordinarily close , as we shall see , to the system developed by the wholly un-mystical Sir Albert Howard ; so much so that in this country the two groups have shown a considerable tendency to fraternize . In Europe , before the war , the educational and research activities of the movement were centered at Dornach , near Basle in Switzerland , where the followers of Steiner , numbering many thousands in over nineteen countries , erected during his lifetime a building designed by Steiner himself and called the Goetheanum . In 1922 this building was burned , and is being rebuilt . An admirably clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ehrenfried Pfeiffer , director of the Bio-chemical Research Laboratory at the Goetheanum . As presented by Dr. Pfeiffer , the biodynamic theory and practice provide at once a method of farming and a broad critique of our industrial civilization , especially of industrialized farming . Pivotal conceptions are those of biological equilibrium and maximum productive load , the " biological resistance point " of the soil . For the biodynamic farmer , the farm , consisting of a properly balanced provision of arable land , equipment , and livestock , is the unit . But in order to become either biologically stable or economically sound , the biodynamic controls must be extended to the region and ultimately to the total human culture of which the permanently producing farm is the focal point . // A single abandoned farm in a well-cultivated region points out Dr. Pfeiffer means widespread damage to the environment , for example , the spread of weed seeds by the wind and the change in the quality of the soil . The presence of many such farms together in the same section can lead to the devastation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sort are known ; in ancient times , Mesopotamia , and recently the dust storms in North America . . . Economic thinking in agriculture can only be justified when it includes the life process in its calculations . If the biological unity of the agricultural enterprise is made the basis of calculation , then the following statement will apply : What is biologically right is at the same time the most economically profitable . To illustrate the italicised principle , Pfeiffer cites figures showing that whereas in Europe the average use of nitrogen fertilizer per acre doubled between 1912 and 1935 , the average yield of summer barley steadily declined . Similar figures for the United States are cited by Ralph Borsodi , leader of the School of Living at Suffern , N. Y. , where biodynamic farming is practiced . To the increasing costs of artificial fertilizers the farmer must add increasing expenditures for the labor and materials used in spraying . The final result of all this concludes Pfeiffer is that crop costs are higher today without any higher crop yield than was the case 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for the regeneration of the farm can be found only in a comprehensive view of the earth as an " organism , " as a living entity . It is clear that the methods of so-called scientific agriculture , with its striving for ever increasing yields and its continued use of ever more mechanical help , have led to an impasse . An important feature of biodynamic market gardening is the utilization by the farmer of the ecological relationships of various vegetables . For example : biodynamic farmers assert that radishes are best in flavor when grown with garden cress as border plants , that kohlrabi and tomatoes are bad for each other , and that tomatoes grow best when fertilized with their own composted vines . Incidentally , Dr. Steiner is himself responsible for many of these observations . How much value attaches to these relationships has never been established , for the reason that biodynamic farming as a // whole has been considered outside the pale of scientific investigation by orthodox agriculturists . Is it true , as Dr. Steiner insisted , that the planting of nasturtium between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is it true that tomatoes and wormwood , planted between cabbage plants , will repel the flea beetle ? Is it true , finally , that grain and vegetables grown by biodynamic methods are higher in nutritive value so that rats invariably prefer them to those grown with artificial fertilizers ? These and many other claims , most of which are made with equal positiveness by the followers of Sir Albert Howard , are important , if true . They could readily be verified by controlled tests in field and laboratory , but at this writing no adequate experiments of this sort have been conducted . Britain 's Agricultural Rebel Like Faulkner , Sir Albert Howard was once a member in good standing of the official priesthood of agricultural research and teaching . There are important differences , however . In the first place , Howard 's revelation is much earlier ? almost as old as the fecund and closely related insights of the extraordinary Dr. Steiner . In the second place , Howard 's rebellion was a good deal more than that of an obscure county farm agent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tight fraternity of official British agricultural research , he had achieved a solid reputation as one of the leading agricultural scientists of the British Empire . After graduating in 1898 with first-class honors from Cambridge , he served successively as research mycologist , studying the diseases of sugar cane in the West Indies , and as botanist to the Southeastern Agricultural College at Wye , England . For nearly twenty years , from 1905 to 1924 , he was Imperial Economic Botanist to the Government of India , and for the next seven years served as Director of the Institute of Plant Industry at Indore and Agricultural Adviser to States in Central India and Rajputana . It is obvious from this record that Sir Albert Howard is one of the ablest and most widely experienced agricultural scientists of his generation . His An Agricultural Testament , published in 194o by the Oxford University Press , is one of the seminal books of our time . A temperate but robust controversialist , Sir Albert has made himself the leader of a world-wide movement with a flourishing press in EngHERETICS // land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly growing number of followers among practical farmers and agronomists as well as amateur gardeners . During his career in India , Howard was impressed by the work of Sir Robert McCarrison . Many years later both men were to ally themselves with the small but distinguished group of British provincial physicians , members of the panel committee of the County Palatine of Cheshire , which in April 1939 issued the challenging Medical Testament . American physicians and other health professionals are somewhat bewildered when , on asking what the Cheshire panel committee did to follow up its ground-breaking pronunciamento , they are handed a small , economically printed quarterly entitled News Letter on Compost : Soil Fertility as the Basis of Public Health . " What , " they are likely to exclaim , " has the technique of making compost out of animal manure and vegetable wastes ? what has this got to do with the practice of medicine ? " " Everything , " answers Sir Albert , his friends , and his disciples , among whom are included some of the most successful farmers and planters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as understood and interpreted by Sir Albert and his followers , is not just a set of tricks for curing sick people , supplemented by another set of tricks for curing sick domestic animals and sick soils . It is a revolutionary way of life . It is a critique of our technological civilization . Can that much importance attach to the use or non-use of compost heaps and other organic methods of soil fertilization and renewal ? One can answer only that some of the best minds in England think so . About a year before the Cheshire doctors issued their Testament , the physicians and biologists in charge of the Pioneer Health Center at Peckham , England , issued their first report , entitled Biologists in Search of Material , which gained them recognition both in England and in this country as representing one of the most fundamental and productive investigations thus far launched into the nature of health and the conditions of its production and maintenance in human individuals and human societies . When the Peckham scientists sought to bring the families in their charge up to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtainable in the marketplace utterly inadequate for this purpose . In the end they were obliged to grow their own fruits and vegetables . And the methods they adopted were the methods of organic farming recommended by Sir Albert Howard . These methods center around the manufacture of compost according to the methods developed by Sir Albert Howard during his period of service as Director of the Institute of Plant Industry at Indore , India . The chief steps are ( 1 ) the admixture of vegetable and animal wastes and earth , with a base for neutralizing acidity , if indicated , and ( 2 ) the management of the mass so that the microorganisms which do the work can function in the most effective manner . Straw , leaves , stalks , weeds , clippings , and twigs of all kinds are mixed with animal urine and dung , kitchen waste including bones , dried blood , powdered hoof and horn and other slaughterhouse refuse , and fish manure . As the neutralizing base , Sir Albert recommends either wood ashes or ground limestone . In his opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this the " biodynamic " farmers agree , adding that the fermentative process is best accelerated by the use of the numbered plant extracts that they supply . Water and air and the proper temperature are also necessary to the process , so the contents of the humus pit or pile must be carefully watered and turned at regular intervals . Organic farming is necessarily mixed farming . On this point Howard says categorically : No permanent or effective system of agriculture has been devised without the animal . Many attempts have been made , but sooner or later they break down . The replacement of live stock by artificials is always followed by disease the moment the original store of soil fertility is exhausted . To maintain and restore soil fertility , Howard relies primarily upon the use of humus , preferably manufactured in compost heaps and spread on the soil ; or by the sheet composting of pastures in which the droppings of animals are mixed with plowed-in turf or green manure . In addition , Howard lays much stress on the use of deep-rooting plants , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing new supplies of minerals up to the topsoil where they can be utilized by the plant . But what about soils which by reason of an early geological happenstance or later erosion are deficient in minerals essential to the // growing crops ? What about the research of the Cornell investigators designed to map these deficient areas , identify and measure the deficiencies including deficiencies of essential trace minerals , and provide for their correction through the use of mineral supplements ? To these questions , posed in a letter by the writers , Sir Albert answered : The NPK mentality dies hard and its devotees clutch at any scrap of science which promises to keep them afloat a little longer ; but all these trace elements like copper , boron , cobalt , etc. , exist aplenty in the subsoil or in the sea . When therefore we use a subsoiler and the deep rooting plants in the ley and also plenty of muck ( humus ) we restore the circulation of the soil and all deficiencies vanish . When seaweed is used in composting we add a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements occur in the sea and so find their way into the seaweed . This answer scarcely takes account of the known facts . It has been proved beyond question that soils may be inherently deficient in certain mineral elements , or their chemical composition may be such as to render certain mineral nutrients unavailable to the plants . Thus , cobalt has often been found to be virtually nonexistent in soils developed from granites . We have many granitic soils in the interior of this country . To make them arable , must we limit ourselves to transporting seaweed from the east or west coasts ? In the West we have thousands of acres of land on which forage deficient in phosphorus grows , and yet phosphorus is plentiful in these soils . It is true that application of organic matter to these soils would free the phosphates , but the manuring of range land in the West would be a considerable undertaking ; whereas many experiments show that treating the soil with superphosphate makes for both healthier forage and healthier cattle . Orthodox agronomists are rather ready to applaud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denying that it originated with either Steiner or Sir Albert Howard . If they do not always advocate this ideal , they point out , it is because the amount of hand labor involved makes it economically impractical . What is more , most orthodox agronomists both in this country and in England believe that soil fertility can not be maintained on highly mechanized farms with compost and manure alone , without unbal148 THE TOOLS OF LIBERATION ancing the system by keeping a disproportionate number of animals on the farm . In February 1944 the followers of Sir Albert Howard , including many titled land owners , staged a vain attempt in the House of Lords to instruct the Royal Commission , appointed to study population trends , to study also the condition of British soils in relation to the health of man , animal , and plant . The reply of the government was that the Ministry of Health " had no evidence of ill-health in the community due to the use of artificial fertilizers in food production , and also that the scientific evidence available pointed to no antagonism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the beneficial results of both in their proper place . . . " This in essence is the official view in this country as well . Whether it is the correct one only time , and the accumulation of experimental evidence , will tell . What may well happen is that official agricultural science , under the prodding of the heretics and the evangelists , will overcome the fragmentation of its specialized disciplines , from which it admittedly suffers , assert its fundamental responsibility to the public health , and demand that it be permitted to fulfill this responsibility up to the limits of our present knowledge . // FOOD PRODUCTION SHORTLY BEFORE THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR II , the German geographer Penck calculated that by the efficient utilization of the world 's soil resources , at the prewar technological level , it would have been possible to feed adequately thirteen and a half billion people , or six times the present population of the globe . For the world , therefore , plenty of food for everybody is a clear potential , a legitimate aspiration , Malthus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already we have more than enough ? if we could use it . For America , the prospect of postwar food surpluses is a practical certainty , just as after the last war . Then , too , our farmers produced plenty , relative to the market , and some of them almost starved to death doing it . This time the menace of too much food is even more alarming to farmers , food processors , and distributors alike . In 1943 we produced 29 per cent more food than the annual prewar average in the years 1935-39 . True , our farmers had good weather on the whole . But hundreds of thousands of their sons were in the services . It was a depleted labor force , consisting of older men , new and inexperienced hands , women and children , that 149 // piled up this tremendous increase , and they did it despite shortages of virtually everything : new machinery , repair parts , building materials , containers , supplies . How much of this increase came out of soil capital ? out of reserves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastures ? Did we destroy our soil in order that we might be able to destroy our enemies ? Yes , but only in minor degree . We committed no such rape of the land as occurred during World War I. Although we have been depleting these reserves to a certain extent says the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the USDA there are no indications that wartime changes in farming have caused large scale permanent injury to soil resources . Some shifting of land from intertilled crops to hay and pasture crops will be desirable after the war , but in many areas this shift does not necessarily mean a decreased output of farm products . On the contrary , a huge increase of food production during the postwar years is in prospect . To this increase a dozen major factors will contribute . During the decade between 1984 and 1943 , we more than doubled our use of commercial fertilizers . This stimulus ? whether or not it caused ultimate damage to the soil and increased plant and animal diseases , as the organic farmers contend ? undoubtedly was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our staple crops , which by 1944 had risen to an estimated 128 per cent of the 1923 ? 32 average . With the postwar conversion of government munitions plants , we can expect ? barring obstruction by the commercial fertilizer industry ? cheaper fertilizers and still greater use of them with consequent further increase of per acre yields . On some soils a ton of ground limestone and 18o pounds of triple superphosphate has increased forage production 57 per cent and its protein content 40 per cent . Fifty thousand test-demonstration farms using TVA superphosphate have increased their production one third . If this " Pilot Plant " demonstration is extended to the whole nation , as proposed by the Farm Bureau Program described in Chapter 21 , there is every reason to expect a general increase of per acre productivity of about the same proportions . An even more important factor in the steady increase of per acre yields was the progressive application of agrobiologic achievements led by Henry A. Wallace 's marvelously productive hybrid seed // corn , of which we shall hear a great deal more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new corn hybrids has been largely confined to the Corn Belt , where it has stepped up per acre yields about 20 per cent . in the near future other corn hybrids will probably extend a similar gain all over the country . New varieties of soybean , wheat , oats , barley , and flax are now available and their general adoption is expected to increase per acre yields as much or more than the corn hybrids . New varieties of alfalfa , lespedeza , kudzu , ladino clover , and improved grasses are expected to increase the per acre production of forage by at least 25 per cent , with a resultant increase of livestock production ? chiefly beef , lamb , and poultry . To this , crossbreeding , artificial insemination , and more effective disease control will add a further increase . The projection of present trends will give us by 1950 two million fewer horses and mules on our farms than there are now , and nearly a half million more tractors , thereby releasing another eight to ten million acres of land for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable that mechanization will proceed at a much faster rate . In addition to improved tractors and tractor rigs , there will be available many new machines including the mechanical cotton picker , the improved cotton stripper , rice combines , flame cultivators , and manure loaders . All these will rapidly increase the man-hour productivity of labor on the land . Sherman E. Johnson of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics estimates that during this postwar period it will be possible to increase the production of farm products 50 per cent above the 1935 ? 39 average , or 20 per cent higher than the peak of our wartime production ? if a market can be found for such an increase . That , of course , is the hitch , as our government experts are quite aware . Hence , in attempting to provide its constituency with a flexible blueprint of the future , the Bureau of Agricultural Economics is obliged to estimate what the market for food will be under each of three possible postwar conditions : full employment , intermediate employment ( 7,000,000 unemployed ) , and serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full employment it is estimated that , taking the 1935 ? 39 average as loo , per capita food consumption would rise only to 118 , while agricultural production would rise to 135 . And since agricultural production is relatively inflexible , our farmers would still be producing // 25 per cent more than in 1935-39 , even in a serious depression . In short , heavy food surpluses are in the cards whatever else happens to our postwar economy . These surpluses can be plowed under , burned , or dumped abroad in exchange for useless gold or even more worthless and embarrassing paper . Conceivably , they might even be eaten by our own people , many of whom have never had enough to eat , either before or during the war . It is important that we take a somewhat critical look at the technological millennium for agriculture which appears to be in prospect . What we are after is not simply cheap food but health , and health is indivisible , affecting the individual and the society , the plant and the domestic animal , the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food as well as its consumer , the economy and the culture . No crude pecuniary cost accounting will serve to compass these vital biological and sociological wholes , whose unit , today and tomorrow , is not the county , nor the state , nor the nation , but the world . Assuming that an uncritical surrender to the technological continuum as applied to agriculture would give us abundant and cheap food , as it might , it is important to realize that such a surrender might also give us : a . A collection of unbalanced quantitative food surpluses that we would n't know what to do with ; b . A tangle of qualitative question marks through which the producers , processors , and consumers of food would have to thread their way with little effective guidance from such regulatory agencies as the Food and Drug Administration , barring the expansion of its authority by new legislation ; c . The accelerated destruction of the family-type American farm , with all the human biological and social values which it incontestably has yielded in the past and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; d . The creation , or rather , the expansion of a modern plebs frumentarium on the land , consisting of hordes of landless and intermittently jobless migratory workers , supported by overt or concealed state subsidies as in the case of the " stoop labor " that helps to provide us with too much sugar , thus furnishing highly mobile foci of epidemic disease and of racial strife . These , however , are all dangers to which we shall succumb only if we are careless and uncritical . They do not invalidate the appliWE CAN DOUBLE FOOD PRODUCTION cation of technology to agriculture ? if the application is n within the framework of a sound nutritional and agricult policy . Before we attempt to consider what the elements of such apt might be , it will be best to add the factors of food processing food distribution to our equation . Certainly a comprehensive , fled approach to the problem of releasing and ensuring nutritic plenty and quality is difficult ; but no other approach is in the 1 valid or useful . // FOOD PROCESSING THERE ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food scarcity and malnutrition can be and indeed are being broken . One is the United States Department of Agriculture and its . far-flung apparatus of land grant colleges and experiment stations , representing unquestionably one of the greatest research and development organizations in the world . The other is represented by the equally magnificent research and development resources of our great food-processing and distributing companies . To attempt to forecast the role of the processor in our postwar food economy is like trying to sculpture futuristic images out of quicksilver . Dehydration , the frozen food locker , the airplane , the synthesizing of new foods and food converters , and the fortification of nutritionally impoverished old foods with synthetic vitamins ? each of these war-nourished or war-deferred developments represents in itself a major revolutionary potential . Combine the best in them and cross-fertilize them with the actual and prospective success of the soil chemist and the plant breeder in stepping up the nutritional content of the crops the farmer delivers to the processor or the dis-154 // tributor , and what you get is an increment of quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impounded and doled out through the channels of an obsolete food economy based on dated and unreal conceptions of scarcity . With the release of war priorities we have already seen a huge expansion of food refrigeration in all its several branches . As a result we may expect not only a substantial improvement in the nutritional status of all classes of the American people , but in addition some highly significant economic and social emancipations affecting both the farmer and the urban housewife . The weapons that will win us these new freedoms are the quick freezer , the community locker plant , the big freezing unit for the farm , and the small one for the city apartment . Supporting this four-pronged offensive of the quick freezers and the refrigerator manufacturers is the growing public appetite for cheap electric power which the TVA and the REA have whetted and which the release of our war-expanded power resources may in some degree satisfy , pending further expansion by such contemplated government enterprises as the Missouri Valley Authority and similar projects . In 1930 there were only 30 quick freezers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 400 plants , including a good many canners and dehydrators that have hedged their investment by adding to their operations quick-freezing food departments . Production costs have been reduced and retail prices have also dropped , although not as much as they should and probably will when postwar competition brings them into line . The average nutritional quality of quick-frozen foods has been advanced both by the selection of superior , high-vitamin varieties , grown under optimum conditions of soil and climate , and by the improvement of quick-freezing technology . Starting with fish , the quick freezers have learned how to process successfully nearly every food in the vegetable and animal kingdoms . Among the most promising of the new products developed during World War II is a frozen fruit puree called Velva Fruit , developed by the USDA Regional Research Laboratory at California . It utilizes off-size and off-shape fruit , looks and tastes like ice cream , and is nutritionally excellent . The Grange League Federation Co-operative serving New York State and parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey has demonstrated the practicability 1 56 THE TOOLS OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an important contribution by developing the model for the river barges that , with auxiliary processing barges in tow , are now successfully quick-freezing all sorts of hitherto little-known fish , including carp , buffalo , drum , and spoonbill sturgeon . At a trading post on Hudson Bay a new plant is freezing and storing whitefish , northern pike , and golden muskellunge . In Chicago and Los Angeles , upper-class homes are being supplied with frozen French fried potatoes , soup , chicken A la king , and other dishes prepared by famous restaurants . In New York a large concern is soon to serve frozen , pre-cooked meals to patients in municipal hospitals . The chief bottleneck of the quick-freezing expansion has been the lagging production and distribution of home freezing units . Within a few years , however , it is expected that they will be as common as electric refrigerators and washing machines are now . The minimum size unit will be from four to five cubic feet and will cost around a hundred dollars . Distribution of these units will be pushed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of these operators plan truck delivery direct to the consumer , on a weekly schedule , which will keep the housewife 's freezing unit stocked with frozen foods . This unit may be either in the apartment , or in the basement of the apartment house . In the suburbs , if the housewife has wisely chosen to maintain her suburban victory garden , she may prefer to freeze her own vegetables and fruit , or to have them frozen and stored for her by the nearest locker plant . The preparation of fresh vegetables and fruits for freezing , for which the Department of Agriculture provides detailed instructions , involves less trouble than an ordinary home canning operation , and the frozen product is superior both in flavor and in nutritive content . Even after six months of storage , frozen foods show little loss of nutritive value . On the farm , the freezing unit ? in the farm size of from 17 to 20 cubic feet , costing around $3oo ? not only emancipates the farmer 's wife from the burden of canning , meat-curing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption or later sale , much fresh produce that might otherwise be wasted . Eventually , it is expected that every prosperous farmer will have his own unit , as well as rented space in the nearest locker plant . The locker plant , in all probability , represents the most imporREVOLUTION // tant contribution to the American food economy since the invention of electric refrigeration . By the end of 1944 , over 5,500 of these plants were in operation and the War Production Board had applications for many more . The minimum expectation of the industry was 15,000 locker plants by 1950 . This figure seems rather modest since by 1943 Iowa alone had 571 locker plants . Theoretically , a completely equipped locker plant is capable of making a given community , with its tributary producing area , almost wholly independent of outside food supplies . Some of the larger plants have in fact come fairly close to this objective . In addition to refrigerated storage , many locker plants provide complete facilities for blanching , processing , and packaging fruits and vegetables ; slaughtering and dressing livestock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering lard and making sausage . If the locker renter buys his food at wholesale prices through the locker plant , he saves from 25 to 40 per cent of his food dollar ; if he brings his own hogs , fruit , and vegetables to the locker plant , he benefits even more . Local self-sufficiency with respect to food will emphasize , of course , the importance of local soil and climate factors . The fewer the sources from which food is obtained , the less protection of the law of averages . Nobody has tried to estimate how much local waste and spoilage of food is eliminated when a locker plant is established in a community , but the amount must be very considerable . There are also important gains in sanitation , brought about by the elimination of much food handling ; even greater gains may be obtained as the use of the ultraviolet ray steri-lamp in processing and wrapping rooms becomes general , although this ray does adversely affect some foods , notably milk . What makes the locker plant seemingly unbeatable is that it eliminates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission merchant , packer , wholesaler , and retailer ? who hitherto have taken 61 cents of the consumer 's food dollar . The only thing left is to make the locker plant the jointly owned and directed service agency of a consumer 's co-operative on the one hand and a farmer 's marketing co-operative on the other ? and precisely this consummation is already in prospect , as will appear in Chapter 25 . In 1939 there were fewer than 6o companies engaged in any phase // of dehydration . By the fourth year of the war , over 600 dehydrators were producing over 2,000,000,000 pounds of dehydrated products . How much of this huge war-born industry will survive the peace ? Perhaps io per cent , in the opinion of the experts . Although it is an exaggeration to speak of dehydration as " the graveyard of vitamins , " it is true that at this writing the dehydrators have on the whole failed to solve their basic problem , which is the retention of both vitamins and flavor . Dehydration got a bad name in the Army in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailing GI view was expressed by the parachutist who said , " The guy who invented dehydration of potatoes , milk , and eggs should also have invented cooks who know what to do with dehydrated foods , or soldiers who would like them . " Dr. Clive M. McCay , nutritionist for the Navy , did not invent dehydration . But he did find a good cook with an imagination . As a result , he had a big contingent of Seabees standing in line for dehydrated foods . Apparently , therefore , the obstacle of consumer resistance will not be insuperable , when the food technologists have licked some of their current problems . Admittedly , however , the future contributions of dehydration to our food economy are still in the laboratory . General Mills has announced a five-year research program in dehydration . Many other food processors are investing large sums in dehydration research , most of it concentrated on the thus far unsolved problem of preserving the vitamin C content of foods . Because of its role in building resistance to disease , many nutritionists believe most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement of vitamin C given in the Food and Nutrition Board 's official " yardstick . " Fresh fruit and vegetable sources of vitamin C are relatively expensive , however , and most processing destroys it ? the pasteurization of milk alone destroys more vitamin C every year than is contained in our entire annual citrus crop . Consequently , studies of low-income diets frequently show alarming deficiencies of this vitamin which could be offset by eating raw onions , cabbage , and other leafy vegetables . Dehydration has already solved the problem in the laboratory , and at least two of the solutions are rapidly moving into the pilot plant stage . One of them is a hugely magnified , belt-line adaptation of the " sublimation " process by which blood plasma is conREVOLUTION // centrated through successive stages of freezing , centrifuging , and dehydration in vacuum at low temperatures . This process can be used to dehydrate vegetable and fruit juices of all kinds , including sugar cane juice , which in its natural state is well endowed with both vitamins and minerals . Another promising sugar process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experiment Station and the American Cyanamide Company . Among the devices adopted for conserving vitamin C are the use of infrared lamps , radio frequency energy , and dehydration in inert gases and in vacuum . One of the most promising candidates is the mega-therm process developed by the Federal Telephone and Radio Corporation . This process heats inside and outside simultaneously and removes 99 per cent of the moisture . Already it has been used successfully to advance the subzero revolution by supplying a practical defroster . One of the most important food developments of the war is the increased use of mixtures in which vegetable proteins serve as a supplemental or partial substitute for the more expensive and less plentiful animal proteins . In 1935 German nutritionists devised the first of these mixtures ? the famous " bratling " ? as a part of Hitler 's preparations for World War Il . Bratling powder is essentially a food supplement rather than a food . As prepared by the quartermaster department of the Reichswehr , it consisted of a balanced mixture of dehydrated soybeans , whole grain , and milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used both as an emergency field ration and to enhance complementally the protein content of sausages and soup . In 1936 our own Bureau of Home Economics devised a somewhat similar mixture for use after the Mississippi flood in feeding refugee families camped on the levees . This mixture was composed of one-third dry skim milk , one-third rice polishings , and onethird corn meal . It found considerable acceptance and was later used by the FERA in its early distribution of surplus foods to relief families . Systematic experiments with cereal food mixtures were conducted over a period of years by Dr. Robert S. Harris of the Nutrition Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The Harris mixtures consisted of various combinations of whole cereals
