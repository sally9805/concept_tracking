Day dreams of escape spark men 's hearts the world over . Wherever discontent and fear and fancied oppression lurk-and that in some measure is always everywhere-men yearn to escape and are stopped by the ugly question : Where ? For those behind the world 's iron curtains , the urge is stronger . Their fears are seldom without foundation and their path of escape is clear : it lies just over the border . <P> Last week , on one day alone , a total of 21 Iron Curtain refugees made the desperate dash to freedom . They came from various levels and followed divergent paths . One was a teen-age girl , a refugee from child-labor gangs in Hungary 's Communist coal mines . One-Yugoslav airline Chief Pilot Milivoje Arsenijevic-had left a good job and a comfortable apartment in Belgrade . Some were driven by despair , some by disillusion , some by disgust . Some merely saw a chance and grabbed it . All had a goal in common . They gave it no name , but it lay just across the border .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
