The Rose Tattoo ( by Tennessee Williams ; produced by Cheryl Crawford ) is laid , like most Tennessee Williams plays , in the South-in a village on the Gulf Coast . But its characters are rowdy Sicilian immigrants , and its tenor is life-loving and affirmative . Playwright Williams has cast off unnaturalism for primitivism , neurosis for fulfillment , the genteel nymphomaniac for the savage one-man woman . But though he has reversed his basic theme , introduced some livelier and trashier tunes , trilled a bit less and banged more , Williams has never seemed so blatantly himself . <P> The Rose Tattoo is about Serafina Delle Rose , whose husband-a lusty man with a rose tattooed on his chest-is killed smuggling narcotics on a banana truck . After his death , Serafina wildly exalts him into a legend , lives devotedly with his ashes , cuts off all outside life . Then , slowly and agonizingly , she is forced to recognize that her husband was unfaithful to her . Through another banana-truck driver , " with my husband 's body and the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and set free to love . <P> Williams began The Rose Tattoo in Rome , so carried away by Italian " vitality ... and love of life " that he jumped from one extreme to another . Perhaps the knowledge that he had been repeating himself counted for as much as the atmosphere of Rome . In any case , at both extremes he displays the same excess : the same romanticism , sensationalism , violence . Now he writes of a woman who , when baffled , shatters her household possessions instead of her sanity-a woman who has to be rescued from a mausoleum instead of sent to a madhouse . <P> Moreover , the play 's tone , if affirmative at the end , is badly mixed before that . After building up a good deal of emotional intensity , Williams snaps the whole mood by turning Serafina 's first meeting with the truck driver into low comedy . <P> The best of The Rose Tattoo is effective theater . David Diamond 's incidental music is pleasant , and Boris Aronson 's set appealing . Maureen Stapleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often the play itself is lush , garish , operatic , decadently primitive , a salt breeze in a swamp , a Banana Truck Named Desire .
