Mercy is a Lonely Business On the night of November ' 2 , 195+ , the 1696 nonvoting inmates of Sing Sing Prison were granted the special privilege of being allowed to listen to election returns by radio earphones after ten P.M. Warden Wilfred L. Denno knew the prisoners had a great interest in who was to be the next governor  --  the man who could commute the sentence of every one of them , including the ten men in the condemned cells . I was elected , and in the three years I have been governor of New York I have learned much about this strange and absolute power most of my fellow governors and I possess . In twenty-eight states the governor has the power of reprieve , commutation and pardon . In many states he has advisory boards , but the basic decision is the governor 's . He can not be overruled and can usually act in all cases except treason or his own impeachment .. I think it makes sense to give the governor such broad powers , but some disagree . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in that they try to secure a pardon rather than reform ; that it snakes the courts careless in imposing sentences or enables judges to impose heavy penalties at a time of public frenzy and later recommend clemency ; and that it is a deviceby which criminals who have political influence can escape a just penalty . It is true that a few politicians have misused their authority . Of the ten governors who have been impeached and convicted since the founding of the Republic , only one , Gov . John C. Walton , of Oklahoma , was accused of pardon abuses . He freed 693 prisoners in eleven months , signing some pardons even before the judges aronounced sentence . Walton was tried and convicted  --  not of freeing the prisoners . but for getting paid to do it . As governor of Texas , Mrs. Miriam ( Ma ) Ferguson pardoned 35(x) persons in 1925-26. - Such abuses have led to public movements to limit the governor 's clemency power . In the past twenty-five years , several states , including Oklahoma and Texas , have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to elected or appointed pardon and parole boards . But the National Probation and Parole Association , possibly the best judge of the matter , urges that the clemency function should not be taken from the governor . There are strong arguments in favor of leaving such decisions in the hands of a governor . Our system of law is one of the highest accomplishments of western civilization , but it is sometimes accompanied by an inilexibility that borders on the inhuman . And there are , occasionally , gross miscarriages of justice . I can think immediately of two cases in New York where only the governor 's pardoning power saved innocent men from electrocution . In 1915 , when I was twenty-three . Gov . Charles S. Whitman appointed me to my first public office as a State Fair Commissioner . Soon after , the governor was embroiled in a controversy that was set off when he took action in a murder case in Orleans County . Charles Sticlow , a farm hand , had been tried and convicted of murdering his employer . The evidence was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stielow 's gun and there was a " voluntary " confession made by Sticlow . Later he repudiated it and said it had been forced from him under duress . But all of Orleans County seemed convinced of Sticlow 's guilt , and with each court stay the local editorials grew angrier at the postponement of the execution . After a hearing , Governor Whitman commuted Sticlow 's death sentence to life imprisonment and noted " there was a possibility , perhaps even more than a possibility , that the defendant was not guilty . " He asked the Legislature for $25,000 to finance a special investigation . This brought out that Stielow 's gun had not 82 been tired , that the confession had been extorted from him and that a certain itinerant peddler was really the killer . An obdurate Orleans County grand jury refused to indict the peddler . To them and the rest of the county Sticlow was still guilty . Governor Whitman ordered Stielow released as an innocent man  --  after three years of imprisonment and untold agony . Incredibly enough , the peddler who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary case the clemency power of three governors  --  Alfred E. Smith , Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herbert H. Lehman  --  was needed to bring freedom to an innocent man , Edward Larkman . He had been convicted and sentenced to death in l926 for the murder of a paymaster in Buffalo . Governor Smith doubted that the man was guilty and commuted his sentence to life imprisonment . In 1929 another man made a deathbed confession of the murder . Governor Roosevelt called for a special investigation . A new trial was recommended , but the time limitation then governing new trials prevented it . Governor Lehman resolved the dilemma by pardoning Larkman . " What a terrible thing it would have been , " Al Smith said later , " if , through carelessness , indifference or lack of intuition , I had let this man go to the chair . " Years after getting his pardon , Lark-man was tried and convicted of receiving stolen property , a crime that had nothing to do with the original murder charge . He is now serving a sentence in Auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man has been tried by a jury ( you can not plead guilty to first-degree murder in New York ) , convicted and sentenced to death . By law , the state 's highest court , the Court of Appeals , is required to review every case involving a death penalty . When this court rules against a condemned man , there is a final appeal for clemency to the governor . Since 1890 , when the electric chair was introduced in New York State , a total of 668 men and I I women have died by electrocution . Of these , eighteen men were executed since I took office in January , 1955 . Two men have had their sentences commuted by me to life imprisonment . When a governor has such power he may find a conflict between his SATURDAY CYCNINO polo . personal feelings and the responsibilities of his office . Oklahoma 's second governor , Lee Crucc , a banker , did not believe in capital punishment . Between 1911 and 1915 he automatically commuted every death sentence  --  twenty-two in all  --  to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but acknowledged that it had no way of curbing the governor 's power to commute . As an individual , Governor Crucc had every right to oppose capital punishment , but as the state 's highest executive I think he was perverting his power of clemency . It is for the people of the state to decide  --  through their legislators  --  if capital punishment is to exist in their state . In my own state , capital punishment is accepted as a deterrent to crime and as governor of New York I must accept that condition . There have been some governors , I have been told , who worried and fretted with the problem of commutation right up to the evening of execution . They would ask the opinions of everyone in their office , their chauffeurs and household help and , of course , their families . One Southern governor who granted commutations freely listened to his wife . " I could deny Carrie nothing , " he told friends , " and she could refuse nothing to anyone else . " Ido not discuss these cases with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subtle method of shifting or sharing responsibility . If I do not commute a sentence  --  and I will not do so unless there are some special circumstances why it should be set aside  --  the decision must be mine alone . " It is , " Al Smith once said , " the governor 's DINT private Gethsemane . " Having made a definite decision considerably in advance of the execution , I try to keep it out of my mind , but inevitably there arc reminders that on this night a man will be executed at Sing Sing at eleven p.m . On the traditional Thursday of execution my calendar is arranged in advance so that I will not be out of the state that day and evening . 1 am always available . On the appointed Thursday morning , the warden at Sing Sing is alerted if there is the remotest possibility of a reprieve . Then , at three P.M. , one of the assistants of my counsel , Judge Daniel Gutman , will phone the warden again to give him March Si , wag two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that evening . The warden always telephones in at ten o'clock to see if any last-minute reprieve is corning . Just as I am always available by telephone on the night of an execution , so does Judge Gutman make sure that he is in his office that night , along with at least one of his assistants . The assistant taki. , all of the last-minute phone calls coming from friends and family of the condemned man , so that the two lines are never tied up . Governor Smith went even further . He set up a secret code with the warden so that no one could successfully mimic their voices in order to delay an eaccution . And Governor Lehman made it a rule that the warden must personally call him no more than fifteen minutes before an execution , to establish that no new evidence had turned up . On January 12. , 1955 , less than two weeks after I assumed office , I held my first clemency hearing . An eighteen-year-old college freshman , Norman Lee Horton , had stabbed his father to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of May 23 , 1953 , the boy left Hobart College and hitchhiked some sixty miles to his home in Elmira . He remained hidden outside the house until the lights were out , broke in and got a kitchen knife . He then crept stealthily into his parents ' bedroom and stabbed his sleeping father . While his mother still slept he stole out and returned to his college dormitory by six A.M. A few days later he confessed . He was tried , found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to death . The Court of Appeals had rejected his plea by a &-1; vote . He was to be executed during the week of January seventeenth . The psychiatrists agreed that he was not normal , but were divided on the question of his sanity . Most United States courts follow the line of reasoning laid down by a British court in 1843 . The rule , since known as the " right-and-wrong " test , has long been considered inadequate by most psychiatrists , who hold that a man might be insane even though he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eight-member commission of legal and psychiatric experts to study the definition of criminal insanity used in New York In studying the Horton case I was impressed by the fact that this deeply troubled boy had given many clear signs that he required psychiatric attention long before the terrible crime . He had committed pointless thefts from classmates . There was a personality deterioration . In his last two years in high school his grades declined sharply and his I.Q. fell from 108 to 81 . By tradition , not by law . I am called upon to hold a clemency hearing before the execution . In bygone ages miserable wretches were brought before the absolute monarchs with whom they pleaded to be saved from the gallows . In New York the condemned man never attends the hearing . The presence of the prisoner would convert what should be an impersonal relationship into an all-too-personal one . But in this case my counsel , Judge Gutman , felt that he should interview the boy before the clemency hearing . It was the first time in fifty years that a prisoner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard he was ushered into Dan Gutman 's office . Before the clemency hearing got under way Dan gave me his summation : the boy was definitely " in a fog . " After the hearing 1 decided to commute the boy 's sentence to life imprisonmeat . " I do not condone this horrible crime , " I stated , " but 1 can not permit the life to be taken of one whose mind undoubtedly is befogged , although he is legally considered sane .... " The case presents clearly the conflict between the legal definition of insanity and the medical and psychiatric concepts . On the one hand we have a criminal who was obviously aware of the nature and quality of his act , of what he was doing and the fact that it was wrong . On the other hand we have a confused boy , beset by terrible guilt feelings resulting from physical and mental abnormalities which he himself is and was unable to explain and which impelled him to the commission of this crime . " The only other murderer whose death sentence 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and required no searching consideration . He was Concepcion Estrada Correa , a seventeenyear-old . He was the youngest person in state history ever to incur that ultimate penalty . He and two others were convicted of killing an eighty-four-year-old grandmother during a ninety-five-dollar robbery . He acted as lookout and did not participate in the actual killing . But under New York State law all those taking part in a felony that results in murder are guilty of murder in the first degree . The district attorney offered to let the boy plead guilty to a lesser crime , manslaughter . But , intimidated by the two older criminals , the lad refused the offer . Correa was tried and sentenced . Since the jury did not recommend mercy , the death sentence was mandatory . Both the judge and the district attorney asked me to extend clemency . The pressures for commutation of death sentences are more intense , but the efforts to get life sentences reduced are , understandably , more persistent . Convicts sentenced to " natural-life " terms are not eligible for parole . In August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in Buffalo , shot and killed his fianc &,; after a quarrel . He then turned the revolver on himself , but the bullet passed through his hat and he suffered only powder burns . There was a suicide note in his pocket . He was sentenced to be executed , but Governor Roosevelt , impressed by leniency recommendations from jurors and hundreds of Buffalo cit'Lens , commuted his sentence to life imprisonment . When I considered Harris ' clemency application in 1956 , I noted that four similar pleas had been turned down by Governor Dewey , even though the Board of Parole had been recommending favorable action since 1945 . In considering Harris ' application anew I was impressed by the fact that his twenty-seven-year prison record was excellent and that he had no previous criminal record . I felt that Milton Harris deserved clemency . He was released late in 1956 under regular parole supervision . in another recent case I commuted the ten-to-eleven-year manslaughter sentence of a seventy-three-year-old man , Edward Nelson , who owned a small rooming house in Brooklyn . Nelson , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some tar on the ground floor to make some necessary roof repairs that had been called to his attention by a building inspector . The tar boiled over , the old building caught fire quickly and two people lost their lives . Nelson had already served three and a half years of his sentence . Accompanying his clemency application was a note from the district attorney urging favorable consideration . In addition , the Board of Parole felt that commutation was justified in this case . When I lightened Nelson 's sentence I felt that this old man had been punished enough for his fatal carelessness . He will be under parole supervision until 1964 . The power of clemency has tremendous responsibilities , great pressures . 1 can understand why some governors would just as soon not have this power . For one thing , it can call for a wholly disproportionate amount of the governor 's time . One of my predecessors was only half joking when he said the state ought to have two governors : one to handle clemency matters and the other to lake care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have an efficient and experienced staff to aid me in my clemency functions . Dan Gutman , my counsel , is helped by Herbert B. Evans , assistant counsel , who spends half his time on clemency matters . He is backstopped by the Executive Clemency Bureau in the Division of Parole , There , Thornton F. Blaaubocr , an experienced parole officer , has two parole investigators who check diligently every clemency application that has surface merit . Each investigation takes four days , even though the men have the resources and records of every state agency open to them . Their reports are models of perceptiveness and their detailed biographies help me greatly in assessing the applicant 's real character , why he committed the crime and what his future prospects are if he is released . I carefully go over every clemency application in death cases , but it would he almost physically impossible for me or any governor to review in all details each of the thousands of applications that reach me every year . So I must depend to some extent on my counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether consideration of clemency is warranted . My background is that of a businessman and government official which , I hope , gives me a practical and commonsense approach to clemency . The fact that Dan Gutman is a lawyer and has been a prosecutor , legislator and judge naturally influencsm , his approach to clemency . These differences in background are helpful in bringing out all the aspects of the case and arriving at what 1 hope are 04 sound decisions . Dan Gutman 's role is , of course , that of ads iser ; the responsibility for the linal decisions is mine . More than seventy years ago , Gov . George Floadly. of Ohio , told of the pressures brought to hear on him for pardons : ' ' As the work is now dime , the pardoning business is carried on mainly by ear-wigging . At the governor 's office , at his residence , on the streets , in the cars , tit the theater , m church  --  everywhere the work of solicitation proceeds . " Things have changed greatly since then  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I have ever been approached personally for clemency . By mail , of course , the applications come in at the rate of some 2500 letters a year , but they are the normal means of bringing a plea for clemency to my attention . One incident has , I think . reduced enormously the pressure that I might otherwise get from public officials appealing for clemency on behalf of a prisoner or his family . In 1953 , Paul L. Troast , the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey , wrote Governor Dewey of New York requesting clemency for a notorious labor racketeer , Joseph S. Fay . then serving time in Sing Sing for extortion . Fay did not get clemency , but the disclosure of Troast 's interest in the racketeer is considered by many to have been so damaging that it caused him to lose the election . As a result , many legislators now think a long lime before asking me for clemency in behalf of a prisoner . In addition , I have let it be known that I do not consider such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The worst thing in the world any governor can do is to let the idea get around that political pressure is the way to get a release . From then on , the pressure will be unrelenting , In New York we base made it as easy as possible for a prisoner to apply for clemency . A lawyer 's help is not necessary . In at least one state , Pennsylvania , an application for clemency must be accompanied by a fifteen-dollar fee and the application itself must be written on forms which cost two dollars per set . In seventeen other states the applicant must pay for achertisements in several newspapers to announce his petition . These restrictive measures arc probably intended to keep down the clemency applications  --  a remote heritage , I suspect , of the days when absolute rulers in Rome and Persia , fearing their own weakness , ruled that it was a capital offense just to ask for a pardon . Our only restriction is that ordinarily I will not even consider a clemency application for investigation until the convict has served at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York State application there are twenty-three questions the convict must answer . The first is : " What is the special reason for making this application at this time ? " The reasons are sometimes touching , often imaganatis c  --  at least once a year a lifer or a condemned man oilers to exchange the " real secret " of Judge Crater 's disappearance for his freedom  --  but more often the reason is that " the sentence was excessis e . " Other likely reasons are that the prisoner has helped justice by helping convict other men with his testimony or by revealing a planned prison break . About 1730. a pardon was offered to a condemned English prisoner if he would allow the great surgeon , William Cheselden , to perforate his eardrum to sec how it affected his hearing . Since then thousands of prisoners have volunteered for all kinds of medical experimentation in hopes of lightening their sentences . In February , 1957 , an airliner headed for Miami crashed on Bikers Island a few minutes after it took off from LaGuardia Airport . Immediately after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island w Licked as a team to rescue and treat the survivors of the burning plane . Most of the inmates were in for narcotics usage or for misdemeanors . I commuted or shortened the sentences of eleven of them who were under state jurisdiction , and the New York City Parole Commission reduced the sentences of forty-six others as a reward for their heroism . In several states mayors arc empowered to remit penalties for siolators of municipal ordinances . What happens to prisoners who arc " commuted to the street " by executive clemeney ? Recently I asked the Division of Parole to check on the seventy-eight men and women who had their sentences reduced by clemency in New York since January , 1943 . Murderers are much the best risk . Only one of the twenty-three murderers on the list had a parole violation : he missed a date with a parole officer . One of the five burglars who received clemency went back to his trade , was caught and given a long sentence . He was the only one of the seventy-eight who has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parole experience in other states . On the average , nearly four out of every ten parolees violate their parole in some minor or major fashion . Parole 's higher risk factor is understandable . The objective of parole is to encourage the maximum number of offenders to return to normal life , under supervision , as useful members of society . Parole violators can be returned to prison quickly , but a United States governor can not rescind a pardon even if he finds it was granted on false evidence or perjured testimony . When Gov . Charles Foster , of Ohio , was told by prison physicians that Isaac Knapp , serving a life term for murder , was dying of t.b. , he pardoned him . A few months later the governor tried to rescind his pardon after learning that Knapp had feigned his symptoms by eating soap , The state 's highest court ruled against the governor . But soon after , Knapp died  --  of eating too much soap in prison . Every year I get hundreds of appeals for partial pardons from ex-convicts . Full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced . I have had no such cases as yet . In 1945 , New York instituted the use of good-conduct certificates for men who had been out of prison for live years or had finished their parole periods . These certificates restore civil rights , such as voting , and enable the holders to apply for a license to practice certain trades and professions . But the certificate has its limitations . It is not recognized in other states . Additionally , a former lifer , now out of prison , is " civilly dead " and requires a partial pardon to restore his civil rights . Under the McCarran Act an unnaturalized alien who commits two or more crimes in the United States is deportable . Deportation is mandatory unless I issue a partial pardon covering one of the two crimsn . Each case of this nature is weighed carefully . Compassion and the man 's family situation must be balanced against his criminal record and the efforts he has made to adjust since his last offense . Since taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and denied many more . A century ago nearly 50 per cent of all United States prisoners could expect to be pardoned before the expiration of their sentences . Today , commutations of jail sentences by all governors amount to less than 2 per cent of the total number or prisoners . Of the 168,596 prisoners in state institutions in 1956 , only 3021 had their sentences commuted . Of course , enlightened parole systems , probation and the use of indeterminate sentences for first offenders have made it less necessary for the governor to intervene . What does remain impressive is the steadily declining use of the power by governors today . Wholesale releases are still in vogue elsewhere . In 1953 , the Italian Chamber of Deputies passed a mass amnesty bill that freed more than 23,000 of Italy 's 50,000 prison inmates . More recently , the Japanese Government , celebrating its admission to the U.N. , voted to free 73,500 minor offenders . Both these mass unlockings were in December , a favorite month for nearly all United States governors and the President too . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the unconditional pardon granted by President Andrew Johnson on Christmas Day , 1868 , to " all and every person who directly or indirectly participated in the insurrection or rebellion . " During my first year in office my counsel and I took a very cautious approach to " Yuletide clemencies , " Thcrc were no commutations . " Customs may not be as wise as laws , " Disraeli once said , - but they are always more popular . " And so it was with the custom of Christmas clemency , Thomas J. McHugh , New York States able Commissioner of Correction , emphasized how valuable , as a morale factor , holiday clemency is to the men in the state 's prisons . Several wardens told me that even a few Christmas commutations serve to encourage good behavior and keep hopes alive for all lung-term prisoners . My staff starts combing out cases in November , and early in December Dan Gutman and I go over about forty cases considered " most deserving . " From these it is not difficult to select those really worthy of clemency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century old in the United States . A few centuries before Christ the Jews maintained a custom of pardons during Passover Week . In the Roman era and later , in the Middle Ages in Europe , strange pardoning customs developed . In parts of Germany , for example , a wife or sweetheart of the condemned man could obtain his release if she ran around the prison three timts  --  tn the nude . Such peculiarities of pardon disappeared with the coalescing of power in the hands of absolute monarchs from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century . The kings became the sole source of clemency for offenders . When royal treasuries were low , many monarchs sold pardons freely . The kings also gave the power of clemency to the royal governors , their representatives in the New World . After the American Revolution , the Constitution provided the President with this power over Federal prisoners , and nearly all state constitutions initially gave the governor clemency power . What does this power do to a gov-ernor ? " Most men grow in public office , " Al Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influences on a governor could be measured , it would be found that the power of reprieve , commutation and pardon adds , as the Bible says , the most cubits to his stature . " I do n't know that I have added any cubits , but the Cxercise of clemency has brought me a deepened sense of mercy and compassion . It has also made me aware of just how backward our system of correction still is . We have made much progress , but we still have a very long road ahead of us . We need more minimum-security prisons and more indeterminate sentences , fixed not by the judge but by a sentencing board assigned to the prison where the convict is held . We also need more forestry camps where youngsters who have made their first misstep can be rehabilitated . in some utopian age every punishment will tit every crime perfectly . Until then , the power of clemency will be needed to set aside the extreme penalty where the law is inflexible and to weigh factors that the judge and jury could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am convinced that mercy is no job for a committee . Sitting alone in his office with the ancient , awesome power of clemency , the governor must take on the most difficult task of all : he must become the conscience of the people of his state .
