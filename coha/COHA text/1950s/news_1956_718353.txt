txt CITY IS PREPARING LOANS ON HOUSING FOR MIDDLE GROUP $75,000,000 Available for Limited-Profit Concerns Under 1955 Statute 6,000 UNITS SUGGESTED New Plan Will Take Up Slack in Financing Caused by Loss of Proposition , 2 Inv CHARLES GRUTZNER The city is getting ready to make loans to limited-profit companies for construction of apartments for middle-income families . These direct loans at low interest will take up the slack in housing financing caused by the defeat last Tuesday of Proposition 2 on the state ballot . The proposition sought to authorize an issue of state bonds up to $100,000,000 for lending to companies that would build housing to rent at about $20 a room monthly . If it had passed , the State Division of Housing would have lent $50,000,000 in this city and $50,000,000 upstate . State Housing Commissioner Joseph P. would have bad to make the selection of projects from loan requests from all over the state totaling more than $300,000,000 . Developers Hope for Loans Many of the deyelopers whose hopes for state loans for construction in this city were dashed last week are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There appears to be foundation for their hope . Such loans can be made by the city , without referendum or further legislative authorization , under the Mitchell-Lama Act passed at Albany in 1955 and made workable by amendment this year . Its sponsors were Senator Mitchell , Republican of Manhattan , and Assemblyman Alfred A. Lama , Democrat of Brooklyn . No loans have been made yet under the Mitchell-Lama Act , but Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa has a special unit working out details in his office for administration of the act and supervision of projects built under such loans . An announcement from Mr. Gerosa that such loans will be made is expected soon . Robbins Tells of Fund Ira S. Robbins , executive vice president of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council , said yesterday there was a balance of $75,000,000 to $100,000,000 available in the fund from which such loans to limited-profit companies would be made . Mr. Robbins estimated that apartments so financed could be built to rent from $20 to $22 a room . The cost might be slightly above that planned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rental estimate was based on partial tax abatement of local taxes , as had been planned // also for state-financed projects . The city loans to builders would come out of a fund authorized as long ago as 1938 to cover aid to public housing . The Mitchell-Lama Act made it possible to issue such money also for loans to limited-profit housing builders . Loans of 90 per cent of the project cost may be made . Mr. Robbins discussed the applicability of the Mitchell-Lama Act in an interview at his office , 20 West Fortieth Street . He said he believed the city could issue at this time loans to make possible construction in this city of 6.000 to 7,500 middle-income apartments . Under Proposition 2 , about 4,000 units could have been built here and 4,000 upstate . The state loans would have been in addition to the program now being administered by Commissioner under the $50,000,000 bond issue authorized by the voters in 1955 . This program , under which construction began recently , will provide 2,000 units here and 2,000 upstate . " While we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Robbins , " we find encouragement , in the fact that even greater amount of middle-income housing can be built with city loans . The state loans would have been strictly a one-shot affair but the city loan fund is a revolving fund . As soon as a housing project gets on a selfliquidating basis after one year of operation , the ' city can make additional loans for new projects . " The direct city loans are seen as a major aid to the construction of apartments at rents within the means of policemen , firemen and other civil servants and middle-income families . This view has been expressed by builders , city and state officials and by citizen groups . The feature of partial tax exemption has been opposed by some real estate boards , taxpayer organizations and by some elected officials . Builders and others are looking also to other ways of taking up the slack caused by defeat of Proposition 2 . Paul Tishman , general contractor who has built some of the largest public and private housing developments , suggested that local business concerns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-income families institutions to take the initiative from leaving the city in great ' numbers . " I believe , " said Mr. Tishman , " that it is necessary for these and form a housing investment ' corporation which could provide substantial initial capital . It would be a small sum compared to the huge investment they would be protecting in keeping middle-income families within the fold . "
