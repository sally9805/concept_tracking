Man 's explanations of the aurora borealis over the centuries have been as colorful as the spectacle itself . When great luminous curtains seemed to swish and crackle in the sky , Norsemen knew that Valkyries were riding abroad . Midwestern Indians looked up and thought they saw the fires of northern medicine men making stew of their enemies . Today 's Eskimos watch the polar pyrotechnics and mumble about the spirits of the dead . Modern science has still another theory . <P> Millions of miles away in space , says Harvard 's Astronomer Donald H. Menzel , the sun revolves like a tremendous lawn sprinkler . From its seething corona dense clouds of hydrogen squirt out at speeds up to 600 miles a second . Every so often one of those clouds hits the earth and bathes the planet in a shower of solar gas . But earthlings are protected by bumpers of magnetic force-invisible bars that stretch from pole to pole . <P> Heavy enough hydrogen clouds , however , manage to bend the magnetic lines of force into a gigantic funnel . Then sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms near the earth 's surface begin to glow and sparkle when struck by the speeding hydrogen . All through the " magnetic funnel " the luminous oxygen shimmers and shines in crimson and yellow and green streamers , which are the waving rainbow of the northern lights . <P> Much of the world 's weather is manufactured in those frigid air masses where the aurora brightens the long polar nights . Dr. Menzel believes that as much energy goes into the display as the earth normally absorbs from the heat and light of a day in the sun . If further observations prove him correct , even meteorologists in latitudes far from the pole will be checking on the faraway fireworks of the aurora borealis before they make their forecasts .
