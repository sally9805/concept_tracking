After almost a month of excited baying , the dogs of war subsided into a growl - still ominous but less noisy . <P> At midweek , from President Eisenhower 's vacation residence in Newport , R.I. , U.S. Secretary of State Dulles read off his - stern warning to Red China ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . In Moscow the Soviet press blustered that , if the U.S. and Red China came to blows , Russia would help Peking " with everything at its disposal . " Peking itself , in a move clearly designed to lend color to future charges of " aggression " by the U.S. , proclaimed that henceforth the limit of its territorial waters would be not three but twelve miles . This would mean , if the Reds could make it stick , that all of Quemoy and Matsu would be in Red China 's waters . <P> Already the Communists had established something close to a blockade of Quemoy . When the Chinese Nationalist navy early in the week tried to reinforce and supply the island , small , fast Communist craft drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and U.S. newsmen who succeeded in getting to Quemoy ( see below ) reported that no significant shipping had reached it since the Communists opened up their artillery assault three weeks ago . Five days later , in response to the Communist blockade , two U.S. heavy cruisers and six U.S. destroyers escorted a pair of Nationalist supply ships to Quemoy 's three-mile limit in broad daylight . Said Nationalist Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek : " Now the problem of keeping the sea lanes open in the Formosa Strait is up to the Seventh Fleet . " <P> <P> Alarm &; Excursion . As the screw tightened , governments around the world registered concern . Overnight , Philippine President Carlos Garcia created a National Security Council that expressed support for the U.S. position on Formosa ; but the President added that the Philippine Republic itself would go to war only " if the U.S. bases in the Philippines are attacked . " Canada 's Prime Minister John Diefenbaker suggested that the U.N . take up the dispute-thereby playing into the hands of Peking , which has been fighting for years for acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that during his imminent visit to the U.S. he would try to win some degree of control over Far East operations of U.S. forces based in Japan . Snapped India 's Nehru : " There is no doubt these islands will have to go to China , and this fact should be recognized and acted upon peacefully . " The British government , moved by its fisheries " war " with Iceland ( see below ) to take a stern stand against Peking 's new claim to a twelve-mile limit , publicly announced that it " fully shared " U.S. concern over events in the Formosa Strait . But in private , British Foreign Office spokesmen made no bones of their lack of enthusiasm at the prospect of active U.S. participation in defense of the offshore islands .
