POINTS OF VIEW ( 284 pp. ) -W . Somerset Maugham-Doubleday ( $4.50 ) . <P> What happens to very old writers when they stop writing ? In the case of W. Somerset Maugham , now 85 , he just goes right on writing . Over the past ten years he has regularly announced his retirement , and now he once more informs the world that his new book , Points of View , is " absolutely my last . " A few critics will hope he means it ; in longhair circles the old storyteller has almost never been ranked above a sound literary carpenter . Yet few professional writers can honestly say that they do not envy his easy style , his civilized yarner 's gift that makes most current fiction seem drear plodding . <P> Sixth Sense . More than 80 novels , plays and volumes of short stories have made Maugham one of the most widely read writers in the world-and one of the richest . He makes no bones about money and the pleasures it buys : a villa on the Riviera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he once put it : " I had no intention of living on a crust in a garret if I could help it . I had found out that money was like a sixth sense without which you could not make the most of the other five . " Maugham 's senses are well satisfied , and in this latest last book he allows himself that ultimate luxury : the writing of essays for pleasure alone . <P> Points of View is no potboiler . There are five essays on subjects not precisely calculated to appeal to the old master 's usual fans . He writes about the short story , the novels of Goethe , a Hindu swami he once met , three French writers who kept personal and controversial journals , and about the life and writings of Dr. Tillotson , a 17th century Archbishop of Canterbury . A doubtful lot , on the face of it , but Maugham has the easy knack of wringing interest out of all of them . Virtually all of his information is from other books ( which he freely admits ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect is that of a good conversationalist quietly voicing some private enthusiasms over some very good , very old brandy . His trick is to talk mostly about people and not too much about his advertised subject . The novels of Germany 's Goethe make an occasion to discuss a man of genius who found it hard to keep away from a pretty woman . After a lucid introduction to Hindu religion , he describes the life of a swami who found the secret of existence in a boyhood flash of illumination and pursued a course of sainthood to his death . And by the simple process of digging up the diaries of three French writers , he makes old gossip seem as juicily Gallic as a Paris headline scandal . Points of View is , in fact , as bland a job of literary borrowing and cool transformation as has been seen in some time .
