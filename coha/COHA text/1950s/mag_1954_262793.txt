Canada 's Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent , flying around the world on a 42-day good-will tour , arrived in New Delhi last week for a visit with his old friend , India 's Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru . Nehru welcomed St. Laurent at New Delhi 's Palam Airport , then scheduled a dozen public and private meetings with him during the next four days . <P> At a press conference , St. Laurent told newsmen that Nehru had informed him in advance of his plan for an immediate cease-fire in Indo-China ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . Then St. Laurent declared , in what appeared to be a friendly , off-the-cuff gesture , that the plan had his complete approval . He would back Nehru 's suggestion " without any hesitation or reservation whatsoever . " <P> His stand was surprising because , for three days , St. Laurent had stoutly defended all the West 's collective-security measures against Communism and the U.S. 's leadership in the world struggle . After listening politely from the visitors ' gallery to a Nehru speech roundly denouncing U.S. military aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joint session of the two houses of the Indian Parliament : " On the question of policies most apt to promote international security there is a difference between your attitude and ours . " Canada , he said , believes in such collective-security pacts as the NATO alliance " to deter possible aggression , " and he added : " We . . . know from our long experience that the U.S. has no other ambition than to live and let others live in mutually helpful international intercourse.
