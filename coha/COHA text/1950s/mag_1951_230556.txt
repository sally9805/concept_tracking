In the ' 80s , Albert Coombs Barnes came out of his South Philadelphia corner fighting. * A poor boy , he worked his way through high school , paid his way through the University of Pennsylvania medical school by playing semi-pro baseball , helped pay for graduate work at the University of Heidelberg by singing in a German beer garden . <P> At 35 , Dr. Barnes was a millionaire , thanks to his development of a bland antiseptic which he named Argyrol . Albert Barnes thereupon went looking for something else worth fighting for . <P> He found it in modern art . A frustrated artist himself ( after 106 canvases , he gave up painting in his 20s " to escape further self-deception " ) , he thought he saw glimmers of greatness in the ridiculed works of the French postimpressionists . In 1912 he sent Artist William Glackens , an old high-school chum and baseball teammate , to Paris to buy up the best examples he could find . The $20,000-worth that Glackens brought back made the beginning of the finest private collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picasso . Barnes followed Glackens to Paris , nosed around junk shops , Montparnasse cafs and studios , haggled with dealers , developed an unerring eye for a bargain . His first Picasso cost him $20 , his first Matisse $50 ; both pictures are now valued at about $20,000 . He found a $40,000 Henri Rousseau in a Paris jewelry shop , paid $10 for it . Other of his treasures came higher . In 1942 , after 29 years of coveting it , he paid $175,000 for Renoir 's magnificent Mussel Fishers at Berneval . At that time , with a collection of some 200 Renoirs , 100 Cezannes , 75 Matisses and more than 1,000 other hand-picked masterpieces , ancient and modern , valued at from $20 to $50 million , Barnes declared that there were only nine more privately owned pictures in the world that he was still interested in buying . <P> Unlike many wealthy collectors , Barnes not only bought pictures , he studied them . In 1925 he published his scholarly Art in Painting , now long accepted as an art text in U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his favorite artists , Czanne , Renoir and Matisse . <P> Quacks &; Cheats . Although Barnes boasted the finest private collection of modern art in the world , few can boast of having seen it . In 1921 , Barnes extended his fight for modern art into a war against all art fanciers and cognoscenti . That year , he lent 25 paintings to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts . Conservative Philadelphians scorned his moderns as " quack practitioners " and " cheats . " Quick-tempered Alfred Barnes took his paintings back from the academy , locked up his collection in a $500,000 limestone museum on his Main Line estate at Merion , Pa . At the same time , he set up the Barnes Foundation to offer free art training to a limited number of carefully selected students a year . Since then , few besides foundation students and personal friends ( including John Dewey , Katharine Cornell , Charles Laughton , Albert Einstein , Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts ) have seen any of his pictures .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
