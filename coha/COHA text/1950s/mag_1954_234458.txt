Since coming to power in 1949 , Chancellor Konrad Adenauer has kept his people 's eyes turned firmly westward . He sold them on the theory that Germany 's future depends on the building of a strong Western Europe . " Europe is coming , " Der Alte promised week after week . Last week , as it became increasingly plain that Europe is not coming , Adenauer faced outspoken rumbles among his own supporters . <P> The first murmurs began after the failure of the Berlin Conference to agree to a united Germany . Dr. Thomas Dehler , chairman of the Free Democrats , No. 2 party in the Adenauer coalition , asked pointedly : " Is it not necessary to enter into conversations with the rulers in Moscow and Peking ? " Adenauer shushed him by calling such talk appeasement . But after target dates for EDC ratification by the French came &; went without action , and the French government tottered feebly , the mutters in Germany increased . The German Chancellor 's policy , said the critics , had gotten his nation nothing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines overflowing , lusted for Eastern outlets . <P> Dsseldorf Talk . Last week the debate came out in the open . Two influential voices expressed their misgivings publicly . Before Dsseldorf 's Rhein-Ruhr Club , Heinrich Bruning , last democratic Chancellor of the Weimar Republic ( 1930-32 ) and now a professor at Cologne University , warned that Adenauer 's policy was inflexible and unrealistic . Germany , he said , must return to its traditional Rapallo-Locarno policy of friendship with both East and West . Through the Treaties of Rapallo ( allying Germany with Russia in 1922 ) and Locarno ( allying her with the West in 1925 ) , Germany had risen from the ashes of World War I. A new Rapallo-Locarno policy would again enable Germany to play the two power blocs off against each other , and reap rewards from both . Adenauer was " too dogmatic " and he was also too dependent on the U.S. , which Herr Professor Brning said gloomily , is headed for an economic slump. * Then up stood old Hans Luther , another pre-Hitler Chancellor ( 1925-26 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through an aroma of fragrant cigars , West Germany 's bankers and businessmen nodded slowly . <P> The Rhein-Ruhr Club is the managerial backbone of German industry . Adenauer could not afford to lose such support . <P> " It is regrettable , " Der Alte cried , " that men of such excellent reputation are making remarks which might be harmful . " He asserted that the Russians had deliberately exaggerated Germany 's potential market in the U.S.S.R. He hit Brning 's " seesaw policy " as unsuitable , and as tending to create " distrust in Germany 's reliability . " Bruning hastily said that he had not meant his remarks to be publicized . <P> Moscow Hint . The Russians did not let the debate die . Pravda quoted Premier Malenkov as promising that the Kremlin would " treat favorably " any West German approach . Dr. Dehler , boss of the Free Democrats , spoke up again last week : " Direct diplomatic relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union are absolutely necessary . " A third party in Adenauer 's coalition , the German Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for Germany .
