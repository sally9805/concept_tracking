TIME OF HOPE  --  AND WHEEZING // Autumn , splendid autumn , was here again  --  in 1957 it was a season of falling leaves and rising temperatures . Though doctors punctured the bared arms of thousands and Macy 's filled flu serum prescriptions ( a package good for five shots : $3.98 ) over the counter , Asian influenza  --  or something disconcertingly like it  --  settled in the bones , bellies and bronchial apparatus of innumerable citizens and made them hate themselves and the bright and lovely world . Professional football teams seemed curiously proof against the bugs , but high school games were canceled last week from Butte , Mont . to Port Chester , N.Y. , the available manpower of college teams fluctuated wildly from day to day ( although perhaps not quite as wildly as their coaches implied ) and distracted bettors sought the latest intelligence from campus infirmaries . // The halt and the wheezing were , however , in a minority and most of them recovered soon ; millions of Americans were able to draw in a feeling of hope and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and West , woodland color ( see SPECTACLE ) astounded the eye , and tree worshipers on double-laned Highway 41 outside Milwaukee caused a truly monumental traffic jam . There was still trout fishing in New Hampshire and the Rockies , still sailing on both coasts , still golf everywhere . Ducks were flying south and 200,000 hunters took to blinds in California alone one rainy day last week . It snowed the same day in Utah 's Wasatch Mountains and a dedicated vanguard of Salt Lake City skiers hurried to the heights . Wisconsin hunters bobbled cardboard deer through the brush on wires and blazed away at them to sharpen their reflexes for November 's venison ; in Omaha a man named Robin Hood , proprietor of a window-washing service , swore to get a deer this year with bow and arrow . // To the young on college campuses , in high schools and prep schools , autumn ( much more than January 1 ) meant the beginning of a new year , of new attitudes , new fads , new enthusiasms . Northeastern college males refer to girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency toward viewing football players with a sardonic eye has spread to  --  of all places  --  Texas ( where 541,000 fans have already paid to see college football games this year ) . At SMU , athletes are known simply as the " animals " and the athletic dormitory is called the " zoo . " The first recorded panty raid of the season took place at the University of South Carolina , but it was half-hearted ; the old rite seemed on the wane although there was still student exuberance  --  the Theta Chis at the University of Nebraska stripped one of their freshmen , tied him in a sack and hung the sack on the doorknob of the Tri Delt house . The " Ivy League " buckle  --  on caps , on shoes , on pants ( which is scratching up varnished school desks something terrible ) is being worn from coast to coast ; and even at Arizona State , Levis , traditional western campus garb , were being supplanted by nonpleated slacks. // Meanwhile , in Baltimore , just before 6:05 o'clock one morning last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roofs , breathed deeply of the fresh air and partook of an absolutely new fall sport : Sputnik spotting . That evening a Baltimore disc jockey announced his favorite 1957 fall song : Shine on , Harvest Moons . // DESPERATION AT WALDEN // Walden Pond is doubtless one of the loveliest , as well as the smallest ( 64 acres ) , of the world 's famous bodies of water . The trees which border it are as bright , this autumn , as they were in the fall of 1845 , when Henry David Thoreau , having moved two miles from Concord , Mass. , was preparing for his first winter there in a 10- by 15-foot hut , and mulling the philosophical thought which was to make his name and that of Walden imperishable . Not all the trees remain , however  --  a stretch of eastern shore has been bulldozed to baldness , affording , from mid-pond , a clear view of " Walden Breezes , " a trailer camp , and nearby hot dog stands . Walden , as a result , is now a battleground. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not only been a sort of shrine for generations , but has always been used , locally , for swimming . When three Concord families ( the Emersons , the Forbeses and the Hey-woods ) deeded the land around the lake to the commonwealth as a public reservation in 1922 , and later when simple bathhouses and swimming piers were built , there were no objections . But last summer , after the Middlesex County commissioners agreed ( at the request of the Red Cross , which runs the beach ) to make improvements , and wangled $50,000 from the legislature for that purpose , the tumult and the shouting rose . // Members of the Thoreau Society ( not only in Concord , but in London , New York and other faraway cities ) were horrified at news of bulldozers and talk of a paved road to the water 's edge . They were more incensed at plans for a concrete bathhouse ( " Just like the Maginot Line " ) . When they heard that one of the commissioners suggested cleaning up " that old pile of rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut on which the devoted have reverently placed stones since 1872  --  their indignation grew unbearable . // The Thoreau Society hurried into court and got a temporary injunction halting the work . The Board of Commissioners seemed astounded and with some reason , since some of the very people who had asked for improvements were now protesting . " I think it 's a great pond and I like to go out and walk through the woods myself , " said Commissioner Thomas Bonaventure Brennan last week . " All we ever tried to do was help the Red Cross . I think these people just do n't want anyone else to enjoy the pond . " So , pending final action in the courts , the matter stood . It was difficult to guess what Thoreau might have thought of it all , but it was hard to feel that he would have been surprised . " The mass of men , " he wrote , " lead lives of quiet desperation . " // JUMPER OF THE YEAR // New York 's Belmont Park belongs to the Arcaros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the racing year but in October , before the horses are vanned off to Jamaica , the United Hunts Association moves in and puts a steeplechase cap on the whole show . // For two days last week Tyrolean hats with saucy feathers burst forth like chrysanthemums . The Turf and Field Club , haunted by emptiness most of the season , became muddied with mink . The hunt set arrived in tweedy clumps and occupied the land of the runner . // Salutations spilled over the lawns , clipped and questioning . " Hello there , George . How goes it ? Have n't seen you since the Garden . Or was it Montclair ? We must get together one of these days . " But all the conversations eventually got around to Neji , who for two years has been the darling of the jump set wherever it gathers , in Middleburg or Malvern or Oxmoor . This time Neji was trying to win his second Temple Gwathmey  --  two and a half miles and 13 jumps  --  under the highest burden , 173 pounds , ever imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambled delicately in the walking ring , his rich chestnut color ricocheting sunlight . As he walked past his owner , Mrs. Ogden Phipps , words of praise came in murmurs : " Do n't ever remember him being in better shape . " On Neji 's back was a six-foot Irish boy named Pat Smithwick , who had boosted his weight from 140 to 145 pounds so that as much of Neji 's 173 pounds as possible would be " live " weight and not dead . A rubber band circled around the left sleeve of Smithwick , holding fast a stick of Beech-Nut gum . // When the 12 horses got onto the course Smithwick unwrapped the gum and popped it into his mouth . The other horses wiggled through two false starts , but Neji stood stoically still . // The tape sprung , and Neji started slowly . At the eighth fence he was sixth but starting to strike . By the 10th he was third , moving like a roll of drums . He went by his stablemate , the 1956 Gwathmey winner Ancestor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in doubt . He sprang away by seven lengths , breaking his own track record by almost three seconds . When he came back to the winner 's circle the people were comparing him to Battleship , the only American horse ever to win England 's Grand National . // By the time Jamaica opened the next afternoon the hunt set had left . The flat racers took over again , and the seasonal argument was taken up again : who should be Horse of the Year  --  Round Table or Gallant Man ? Few words were spoken of Neji . But maybe he is. // WHISH-WHOOSH // Anybody who wants one can now buy a long-playing phonograph record which will give him , in meticulous high fidelity , 40 minutes of the assorted noises made by sports car engines . Sports Cars in Hi-Fi is the product of Riverside Records , a small but lively organization whose president , producer , engineer , sales manager and art director are all young men in their 30s and all sports car owners . The company started out recording music , plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1956 Grand Prix of Endurance at Sebring , President Gill Grauer taped the sounds of voices and engines as he heard them along the circuit and in the pits . // " Just to see what would happen , " says Grauer , " we put some of it on a record and called it Sounds of Sebring . It sold like mad . " // So now there is also Pit Stop ( made at the Nassau Trophy Races in December 1956 ) and Sports Cars in Hi-Fi made at Watkins Glen ) . The latter album has a program note for each car : notice the valve surge on the PBX : whish-whoosh , whish-whoosh. // The market for all this sound and fury is as precisely limited as the market for surgical instruments . Hi-fi purists buy the records because the deep roar of the engines is ideal for showing off their equipment , and sports car owners buy them because , as Grauer explains it , " They are a well-heeled lot and they all like to own every scrap of material that concerns their sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Riverside Records decided to try plain talk as well and so issued a series of almost sloppily relaxed conversations with top racing drivers . Each man is allotted an entire LP record on which to speak his thoughts about himself and his profession . The Marquis de Portago , musing about death on the race course , said , " Every driver believes it can never happen to him . I know it wo n't happen to me . " ( A few months after he made the recording , Portago was killed in the Mille Miglia in Italy. ) // Carroll Shelby , speaking with affection of the old striped overalls he likes to wear in competition , says , " They 've been in something over 100 races now and won about 88 of them . " Stirling Moss admits that for touring , he would settle for " a Lincoln or a Caddy with air conditioning and reclining seats and a radio . " // Only the sports car fans seem to care for the talking records . The hi-fi bug sticks to the engine sounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hear a wide-open Maserati come screaming up from the turn , plunge through his living room , and fade away down the stretch . // A ROCK FOR ROCKY AND THE REF // The most boring fight of the year was inflicted on a Madison Square Garden crowd and a network of U.S. living rooms Friday night when Rocky Castellani alternately clutched and backpedaled for 10 rounds in an effort to escape the fists of Rory Calhoun , No. 5 middleweight contender in the National Boxing Association rankings . If rankings mean anything in matchmaking , there was no good reason for the fight , presented by the International Boxing Club ( James D. Norris , president ) , since Castellani is so rank as to be unranked and unlikely to be ranked . // Referee Harry Kessler made a noisy effort to persuade Rocky to fight , but got nowhere . " Come on , Rocky , " he pleaded , loud enough for ringsiders to hear , " let 's make a fight of it . " Castellani ignored him . // He might not have ignored him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pre-TV referees have exercised . He could have threatened to stop the bout and award it to Calhoun and he could have carried out the threat if Castellani persisted in his preposterous retreat . // But Kessler did nothing of the sort , of course , though some of the spectators were walking out on the silly affair . This is the TV era of boxing , with the IBC in command , and that 's the way it 's going to be until a competitive situation is established in boxing . // VINDICATION FOR MUGGSY // In Philadelphia , the City of Brotherly Love , there 's this Muggsy Taylor . Now Muggsy 's not the First Citizen of Philadelphia , but neither is he the first citizen Philadelphians would like to ride out of town on a rail . // Muggsy is not really a complex character , but he is a man with sides . One is the less gainly side he himself revealed from the witness chair in 1950 when the Kefauver crime committee was playing an engagement in Philadelphia . He was a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underworld characters as Frankie Carbo , boxing 's most sinister behind-the-scenes figure , Al ( Scarface ) Capone , Charlie ( Lucky ) Luciano , Frank Costello , Charley Fischetti , Rocco Fischetti , Jake ( Greasy Thumb ) Guzik , Meyer ( Slats ) Lansky , Little Augie Pisano , Mickey Cohen , Longy Zwillman and Murray ( The Camel ) Humphreys . To which may be added Harry ( Nig Rosen ) Stromberg , recently indicted in New York as head of a multimillion-dollar narcotics ring . // But then there is the blindingly virtuous side that was revealed for the first time recently when Philadelphia Mayor Richardson Dilworth , District Attorney Victor Blanc , City Council President James H. J. Tate , Municipal Court Judge Emanuel W. Beloff , Commissioner Bert Bell of the National Football League , and Frank Weiner , former chairman of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission , stepped to another chair in an inquiry into Muggsy 's general worth and allowed with right hands raised as how Herman Taylor ( Muggsy 's square moniker ) is one of the most valuable and trustworthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metropolis . // The occasion for the revelation arose when doubt had been cast on Muggsy 's essential fitness to hold a license to promote prizefights in the State of Pennsylvania , and it came in the nick of time , for a former fight manager and a once up-and-coming middleweight fighter gave testimony before the Pennsylvania boxing commission that Muggsy was anything but the righteous promoter he was being cracked up to be . The fight manager was Donald E. Rettman , 57 , a former Trenton , N.J. department store personnel director . The fighter , George Johnson , 27 , once had belonged to Rettman , though not for long . For , they testified , Muggsy had snatehed Johnson from Rettman and became his manager-in-fact though , as a promoter , it was illegal for him to manage fighters . He operated , they said , behind a front in the person of Archie Pirolli , Muggsy 's press agent , who became Johnson 's manager of record . Rettman was testifying , he said , even though he and his family had been threatened by New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The threat had worked once , when the commission was forced to abandon an action against Muggsy because Rettman did not appear to testify and could not be subpoenaed out of New Jersey . Muggsy just let his promoter 's license lapse on December 31 , 1955 and waited until last April , a more propitious time , he felt , to apply for a new one . But in the meantime Rettman and Johnson had come to SPORTS ILLUSTRATED with their story , and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED had properly referred them and their evidence to the Pennsylvania commission . // Muggsy 's lawyer  --  a Philadelphia lawyer , natch  --  was Morton Witkin , alternately badgering and gracious , and always loquacious . In the end it turned out that Witkin could have sat serenely silent , like a TV drama lawyer , and said nothing more than " No questions , your honor , " throughout the proceedings . For it developed that the commission had to grant the license anyhow , or believed it did , because the evidence against Muggsy , who denied everything , referred to events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Pennsylvania Athletic Code came into being . Under a recent decision of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County , the commission can not punish a licensee , or refuse a license to an applicant , because of acts committed before the code became law . So the commission felt " impelled " to grant Muggsy his license . // What this means , apparently , is that brotherly love also will be extended even to Frankie Carbo , onetime gun slinger for Murder , Inc. , if Frankie should apply for a license in Pennsylvania and no one could prove that he had done wrung since 1955 . But the chances are Frankie does n't want a license . His old friend Muggsy has one , and brotherly love to spare .
