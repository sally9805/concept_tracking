Somebody Loves Me ( Paramount ) is a humdrum musical that strings 20 songs , including Way Down Yonder in New Orleans , On San Francisco Bay and Wang Wang Blues , on a story line " suggested " by the show-business careers of Husband &; Wife Team Benny Fields and Blossom Seeley . According to the picture , popular Songstress Blossom ( Betty Hutton ) marries unknown Vaudevillian Benny ( Ralph Meeker ) . But Benny resents being " Mr. Blossom Seeley , " and insists on making good on his own before he does a duet with Blossom . With his wife 's help , he finally makes the grade in the big time , and they exit triumphantly together singing the title tune . <P> Still active Benny Fields and his now-retired wife , who served as technical advisers on Somebody Loves Me , contend that the picture is " 99% true . " As written and played on the screen , their story comes out as the sort of life they might have led if Technicolor cameras had been looking on . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of growing up for twelve-year-old Bibi Bonnard ( Bobby Driscoll ) in the Ottawa of the ' 20s . The picturesque Bonnard family , headed by a kind , understanding papa ( Charles Boyer ) and strait-laced maman ( Marsha Hunt ) , includes lovable , lecherous old grand-pre ( Marcel Dalio ) , who chases after widows , Uncle Louis ( Kurt Kasznar ) , who drinks vast quantities of white wine from a water cooler , and Uncle Desmonde ( Louis Jourdan ) , a traveling salesman who collects ladies ' garters . <P> When shapely Mignonette ( Linda Christian ) comes to work for the Bonnards as a maid , Bibi feels the first stirrings of sex . He steals a kiss from Mignonette while she is asleep . He is also falsely accused of drawing a suggestive picture at school . But all ends happily , with Mignonette and Uncle Desmonde in love , grand-pre getting out of his sickbed to continue his adventures , and Bibi putting on his first pair of long pants and kissing the little girl next door . <P> Adapted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit play of the same name , The Happy Time comes to the screen as a sort of Andy Hardy family of Canada . It substitutes slick film-making for the real wonder , strangeness and nostalgia of childhood , and a rather heavy-handed coyness for the lightheartedness of the original . The most genuinely human touch in the picture is provided by Charles Boyer 's warm performance as papa , and his impassioned delivery of a lecture about the facts of life &; love to wide-eyed Bibi . <P> Big Jim McLain ( Wayne-Fellows ; Warner ) starts off with a documentary sequence of the House Un-American Activities Committee in session in Washington , D.C. From there , the picture goes on to some wildly fanciful movie melodrama . Big Jim McLain ( John Wayne ) and his partner ( James Arness ) are committee investigators assigned to dig up evidence about a Communist spy ring in Hawaii .
