P %MT FIVE FTER Captain Kim had so happily given me the word that the United Nations forces were routed and about to be kicked oil ' the Korean penirululn in mid-January , 1951 , I stayed all night and the MXt day in an office near Sunan . I expected to be taken on south to Seoul , but my gum , was wild . This was the beginning of my worst year ? n year of two houses , two caves ' , many flies , malaria , a ! succession of odd guards , bad news and terrific boredom  --  all within a three-mile radius . This was the year when the North Koreans appeared to forget about Dean entirely and when I had difficultymyself in remembering who or where I was , and in maintaining any sort of sanity . The fine house was not far from the office . Again we walked through the cold , and I succeeded in completing the trip under my own steam mainly because a guard exchanged his straw shoes for my undersized GI shoes , which provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual small kitchen plus one room about eight by twelve feet , rind this eventually was partitioned so that I had a section eight by four feet , or slightly narrower , with a door always open to the larger room , but no light except what filtered through a paper window or came over the top of the sixty-six-inch-high partition . Behind this wall I slept , bootlegged some calisthenics  --  beingcareful not to raise my arms ao they could be seen over it  --  and kept a secret calendar scratched in the mud under my sleeping mat . But I had nothing to read and neither pencil nor paper to use if there had been light enough . I still was not permitted to stand or be down between early morning and ten P.M. Part of the time , I was allowed ten or fifteen minutes ' daily exercise in my own room  --  and managed to gel in 2500 yards of walking one day by taking four steps in one direction , then four in the other . Otherwise I had nothing whatever to do . My days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the guard could see me , or behind the partition , so that wandering Chinese troops could not . My food was brought to me , usually twice a day , and almost always it was a mixture of rice and barley , with garlic tops , seaweed or other greens . U Eun Chur still was in charge early in the year . He continued to waver in his attitude , worrying terribly when I was sick  --  perhaps more because of his responsibility than because of any sympathetic interest  --  and in virtually the next breath restricting my activities even further . New Regulation : No Silent Counting ! T HE lop in restrictions came one day when he caught me counting to myself . My hands were swollen from demon so I had worked out a cross-finger exercise which consisted of pressing thumb and forefinger together five times , then the thumb and second finger , and so on across both hands . I did this with my hand at my side ? by then knowing better than to let the guards see me do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw my lips moving . Immediately , he said in Korean , " What are you doing ? " and made me understand by mimicking my lip movements . I said , " Counting  --  if , ee , whet , oak oh . " ( In Korean , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . ) He scowled , and there was no mistaking his negative . I must not , he indicated , count without permission . I 'm still of two minds about this man . He was a nuisance , enforcing every restrictive rule to the Miter and making up new ones of his own . But he had been one of the guards during my interrogation in September , 1950. and I 'm sure he took his cue from the " lovable " Colonel Kim . But 17 also was a fine soldier and scrupulously fair . I ndreired the way he drilled his squad and divided the work . However , my final experience with him was on the ludicrous side . In this communist army , soldiers stealing from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always indoors while we were at this house , and my summer clothes hung in the end of my small room . So , when a guard acquired some small treasure , he often would hide it in my suit-coat pocket . Sometimes two or three guards had things hidden there simultaneously  --  but for some reason never in the same pocket . Only U had never done it . But on May sixth the guards had a pnrty , the first I 'd known them to have , complete with special food and nuke , and a great dent of talk rind laughter . in the middle of the festivities , U staggered into my room . He was aware that I did n't smoke . He lifted the bock corner of my mat and under it dropped a package of almost a hundred rigerettes , smoothing the mat down carefully over them . The party continued without interruption . Now , one of U 's special tricks was to institute a thorough search of my belongings without warning . On one such , he had found the only scrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a bomb . On May eleventh he came in for another ) ( mock-down , drag-out search . I did n't have n thing to be found except one little handkerchief which I 'd hemstitched for myself , with a borrowed needle and small skill , but this became an issue , although he finally let me keep it . Then he lifted the mat  --  and really did jump up and down and go into a lather . This , obviously , was going to be a super performance  --  until I begun to laugh I could n't help myself . All I could do was to point at him and repeat " Tong sun " ( you ) . He might have been able to paaa it off . But another guard was helping in the search and saw it all  --  and of course know ( CAnaloned on Past . 135 ) MY THREE YEARS AS A DEAD MAN ( Continued fmm Page 30 ) I did n't smoke . U apparently had been given those cigarettes for all the men at the party , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently forgot all about them when he sobered up . Now , the only thing he could do was to make an equal distribution . It wage trivial thing , but one of the high moments of my year . The next day U came to say good-by , and was wearing the shoulder boards of a second lieutenant . Before I left Korea , I felt like a prep school for officer 's ' training . More than half my guards had gone on to commissions . In early 1951 , my own spirits grew steadily lower ; and for what . it 's worth , I had two obsessions of clairvoyance : I was sure both Lt. Gen. Walton Welker I and Col. Henry LHankl Hampton , a close personal friend , had been killed . I even had a date  --  early ? anuary  --  for General Walker 's death and was positive it had happened while he was visiting the front . I 'm sure no one bad even mentioned those names to me for months . But in midsummer I learned I had been right about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circumstances . And after I was released , I also learned Colonel Hampton had indeed been killed . I have no explanation . There was nothing to raise my spirits . Chinese troops poured through toward the south and used this area as a staging point to familiarize troops with American weapons . Day after day I heard the distinctive sounds of M-1 rifles and EIAR'e as one man after another was given a chance to fire a few rounds . Chinese mule-drawn vehicles were common and sometimes I could hear the doh-dit-doh of radio coming from the wagons . The Chinese , however , worried the guards even more than me . Night after night , the Koreans had to repel Chinese attempts to share my house . Obviously , the Chinese were accustomed to billeting where they wished . The Koreans , under orders that no one was to see me and very much afraid the Chinese would grab me if they learned my rank , were determined that no one should get in . This produced long nightly arguments ; and finally , my guard was increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , in addition to the one watching me . Even so , there was trouble , and one night a general alarm of some sort took the whole guard out , with weapons at the ready . I thought this might be just what I was looking for , so got dressed and waited for the shooting to start ? at which time 1 would take to the tall timber  --  but it never did . In March I came back into official notice . This notice consisted of a visit by three officers , a four-star colonel who did n't take off his boots when he entered the house  --  a serious insult in the Orient  --  a major and an officer-interpreter without rank insignia . These people again told me our forces were being driven south and were surrounded . So what did I think ? I said I thought we must not be doing too badly , because I 'd been told we were surrounded two months earlier ; so , if 7 we still were fighting , that was quite a record . The colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and single women but they raped married women , pregnant women and little children , and it was sanctioned by your officers . " I said f his was an outright lie  --  American officers do not sanction rape . I myself had rip-proved the extreme penalty in rape cases . But suddenly , the interpreter spoke up on his own . " That 's not . true , " he said . " I know you 've had rapes . I worked for your Criminal Intelligence Division and I know you had troops at Inchon who raped and did n't get the death penally when found guilty . " I 've never been able to learn who this particular turncoat was . The colonel also wanted me to remember my place . " You 've lost all your dignity , " he said . " You must quit trying to act like a general . Here you are , a prisoner , but even the guard coin-plains that you try to act like a general . You 're no better than a dog . Stop trying to act superior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Why did I think the Chinese " volunteers " had come in and were light ing us ? I said , " Because their master told them to . Because Stalin told them to . " This made them all chat ter . The interpreter finally said , " If the Soviet had wanted to attack , they would have attacked when your troops went to the very border of the Soviet Union , but not a Soviet soldier entered the fray . Therefore , the Soviet would not order anyone else to fight . The reason the Chinese came in is the some reason that you would take action if there were a burglar in your neighborhood . Our Chinese brothers saw robbers in their neighbor 's house , and that is wiry they came to our assistance . " Well , it was n't much fun , but at least I had learned about the United Nations eastern stab to the Yalu River , which NW news to me . The visit also gave me an opportunity to do some beefing of my own . I demanded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencils , to be allowed to stand up , trt get more exercise and to get outdoors . Previously , I 'd made such requests just ns requests , but this time I was irritable and made demands . Not that they did any good . The only answer I got was that these matters would be taken up with " higher authority . " Then my vi  --  itors trooped out , but I wile mildly amused to notice that the word about my attempt to kill Kim must have spread . These cookies kept two special guards with submachine guns at Lhe doors rill the time they were in the house . Except for this visit , our little routine went right along with no major changes . Dee Soon Yur , left in Maitre walked 150 miles to rejoin us in late January . A new guard , Pak  --  the Manpo Pack had gone to officers ' school  --  worried about another guard 's watch lucking a crystal . So he found an old electric-light hull , and went to work with a pocketknife blade , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad a watch crystal . ( Try it some time if this does n't sound difficult to you . ) I was shoved , with a straightedge razor which a guard also used to trim his toenails , on an average of every seventeen days , and got haircuts at the sauna time . I oleo learned that in Korea you do n't darn socks but patch them . These guards patched their own and I learned to do it myself , until patches were on top of patches and surrounded by patches . But I never tried what I saw  --  one guard patching another 's socks while they were still on the feet . That looked hazardous to me . In March I had my first sick spell . I had severe pains on my right side , my temperature climbed and I could n't cot . Finally a doctor visited me , but 136. about the only reaulta were a few tiny cubes of meat in my food for a day or BO . And I was allowed to slay in bed . This Ica-day illness made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been huidiending my strength for the epring , when l was sure there would be a United Nations counterattack and perhaps an opportunity to escape . My guess-clay had been March fifteenth , lint perhaps it 's as well that the attack did n't approach us . I was too sick to have run a block , let alone slip through the lines . My morale continued to sink , and finally I realized I had to do something about it ? get something to think about . So I started working simple algebraic problems in my head and playing mental anagrams  --  how many different words can he made out of the letters in SACRAMENTO ? Having no paper , I kept score in my head and obtained simply fantastic totals , from Sacramento , Washington , San Fra.ncieco and other polysyllabic localities . Someday I want to sit down with a dictionary and check my totals , but I have n't had time yet . Then one day I began working on squares and square roots , and really got interested . I memorized the squares of numbers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems of repairing . For example , the squares of numbers between 10 and 211 have the some right-hand digits as those between 611 and 70 , and the relationship follows through . So the square of 40 is 1600 ; the square of 41 is 11561 and the square of 42 is 1764 , and the square of 90 is 81110 , the EigkIlire of 91 la 171281 , and so on . If you 're not interested in muthe'unties , this sort of thing may drive you to beating your head age inei a wall . but believe me , it kept me from beating my head against one . I finally rationed myself ? I could square 500 numbers:3day , but no more . So I had something to work on every day . Dee Soon Yur became head guard when U Eun Chur left , but my eituaLion improved less than I 'd hoped . I still was n't allowed to titand , and got no exercise except for a few minutes each morning . But the local situation changed for the worse . Planets came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof off . Thieve were light propeller-driven hem liena and they harassed this valley continually . The guards built an air-raid trench with one and inside the kitchen , so I could reach it without being seen outdoors . Time after titre ) I was ordered to crouch in this dank hole while the homlieni worked . There seemed to he no heavy antiaircraft tire , hut . everybody fired something  --  rifles , burp guns , machine guns . I thought . casualties from all that flying lead mutst be larger than from the horn he . I objected to this trench on various grounds . among them the fact that it interfered with my newest game  --  killing fliee . I 'd done a little strictly amateur fly-killing in 1 he previous autumn , but now I got serious about it . In April , 1951 , the first of the licaeon 's crop appeared and I started batting at them with my palm and keeping track of strikes and hits . I figured that if I could hat .300 with my hare hand , I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to keep track mentally , and I ended May with an even 300 flies killed and a batting average just over .300 . In the first half of June , my average was better , but total hits were the same  --  an even 300 . Than Dee presented me with a fly swatter made from a willow branch and the half sole of n shoe . My average immediately took a terrific jump to February 20 , Pat .760 . I was studying flies and think I eventually could have hit .850 . The trick is never to swat a fly when he 'll standing still . Wait until he starts walking or lifts his front . feet to wady . Then you hunt him , because he ca n't ' take off without shifting position first . ' The guards were interested now , but insisted that . I could n't count my seem unless I produced the corpus delicti , I carefully saved each deceased fly due ing the day ; then crawled over to I present them at night ? this really was a dignified procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down my total and batting average for the day . My June total  --  half the time with the swatter  --  was 2866 . I 'd already figured this in my head , so when the time came for official scoring , I merely put down the blows struck and totals without adding the columns . This fascinated one guard , who immediately checked my columns and claimed to have found an error . I rapidly added it then , and got my original answer , hut I heed ! insisted I was wrong . We argued loudly in two languages , and then I foolishly became provoked , tore up the paper score and told them to keep their Mies , damn them . Both Dee and the other guard were angry , and I kicked myself for indiscretion  --  I was afraid they might take my swatter ? but nothing happened except that I no longer counted total stroked , ellust to keep the vitally important record straight , my top day in 1951 was 492 kills , but my all-time best , in 1q53 , was a 522-fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1952 , but in 1953 lost interest and murdered only 4180 , or a grand total of - 10,716 . Anyone who wants to challenge my three-year swatting record will have to show me the Hies . ) Our routine was broken once when Dee 's wife walked sixty miles from Haeju to see him and he took a night nil ' in celebration  --  the first night I 'd known any of the men to get a pare . Chong-gun , the Korean chess game , was resumed as a regular thing , but I still could n't play . Kong . one of the older guards , became very ill , was taken to a hoapital and returned three weeks later with a drain still in an ugly wound in his side . I thought he had been operated on after an appendix had burst , hut , he went hack on limited guard duty . In April I also had n second sick spell myself ? hepatitis , I think  --  which further put off any escape plane Even when I went down to the kitchen , en route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a couple of times , I passed out completely while trying to walk . I still was allowed to wash once a day , theoretically , but often the guards forgot or neglected it  --  and the surest way to get a negnLive answer Was to ask to wash . This was especially iennoying after I started killing flies , because each well-aimed blow also raised a cloud of dust , and I 'd he filthy at the end of the day . But my campaign did some good . By midsummer , off-duty guards were always coming into my little room to sleep , because there were n't so many flies there . But the mosquitoes remained terrible , no matter how many we killed or how often fire WWI built in the onder to smoke them out . The only real result was to get the floor so hot that we slept in pooh , ' of perspiration . The air-raid trench filled . with water , and mosquitoes bred in it , actually inside the house . Many stood on their heads  --  sure sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I And on July fifth , I had another visitor : Major Kim , of the Susan intarrogating team , with an interpreter . I Kim said he had just come to ate how I was getting eking , and did I think the war could ho ended by negotiation ? I said I doubted it .. AN I remember , I stated it : " I do n't think there would be a chance in the world . The United States never starts wars , but when we do fight them , we fight to win . And we do win . " Kim said , " I did n't come to argue , but I feel the only way that the war can be ended so there is a permanent peace is by negotiation . " All during July , I noticed that the men were gone during their off-duty hours in daylight , and on July seventeenth , Dee announced with obvious pleasure that we were moving to a " trenchee . " I He had picked up the word from my designation of the air-raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went about 200 recta up a steep bill just behind the house . Here we entered a covered trench dug across the side of the hill . Thia was six feet wide , about fourteen feet long and barely high enough for a man to stand between the rafters supporting the dirt roof . It was entered through a right angle at one end , and the floor was three feet below the doorsill . A five-foot bunk for a guard was on either side of the main tunnel , and at the far end , a bay had been dug beck into the hill . This five-by-sixfoot haven was all for me , and three and a half feet of the width were occupied by a wooden bench , my sleeping couch at night , my sitting room by day . The cave , Dee assured me , would protect ua against pohengt-gt ? airplanes  --  and flies . But it was also dank , full of mosquitoes , chilly and completely airless . I put on my heavy underwear and winter clothing to keep warm . Three guards moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house below . Dee had assured me I would get aunhaths and walks at the cave , but I got neither . Rain started immediately and kept up for days  --  rain such as I 've never seen outside of Korea . On the chilliest days , the guard would bring in an hibachi ( Japanese charcoal burner ) , which raised the temperature a couple of degrees , but also filled the cave with charcoal fumes . The roof leaked and guards dug ditches to drain water off the floor . On about July twenty-fourth-1i red-letter clay that I should remember more exactly ? a guard came home wit b a loaf of bread . I felt like putting my torn-off chunk of it up somewhere just to look at , but wonder gave way to hunger ; so I merely told the guard to forget . about any other food that day . I did n't want anything else to spoil the taste of that wonderful bread . I learned later that Dee , worried about my inability to eat as many red . hot garlic beads as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters had increased my food allowance to 800 ton a day , compared to 500 allowed for each guard  --  and to the sergeant 's basic poly of 1250 ton a month . The bread represented the first of the ration increase  --  and it was also the find I 'd seen since early September , 1951 ) . The rain continued , and the drains would n't work . Sometime after midnight on July thorty  --  first . a guard shook me awake . I put on my clothes and stepped down into waist-deep water which already had covered the guards ' bunks . In pouring rain we sloshed back to our village castle . Three sleeping guards were routed out of my four-by-eight special section , and an old woman and a child sleeping in the main room were ousted the next day . On August . fourth I began to run a fever in a typical malarial cycle which Jeft me sleepless and half out of my head , gradually going insane from the sound of a wall clock ? I swear it said " dih-dub " rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main room where I could n't eve It  --  so I beat my brains nut trying to figure out the tim from the ticking . Of course , I could n't get enough water to drink and was becoming delirious . Finally I wrote a note : " Quinine or Atabrine. " and Dee went off to see ti owiah ? doctor who I hoped would somehow get the note translated . To my delight , Dee came back in a few hours , with five big yellow A ta brine 138 tablets , which gave me almost immediate relief . In Tokyo much later , American doctors told me this may have saved me , as Atabrine is their treatment for dysentery as well us When I began to feel better . I thought again /shout escape . Summer was full . brush was leafed out and the fields were full of corn and other vegetables . If I ever was going to get through , this was the time . Fortunately , we were get ling a little dried fish with our rice at ( his time , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to leave some bones for the guards and cook to eye , but wrapped the rest in hits of paper and hid it in the pockets of those trousers hanging on the wall . The guards hiding treasures always used the coat pockets . On August fifteenth , Major Kim came again , and this time I found nut , after much muddled translation , that he wanted information about Robert A. Lovett. and was quite disappointed when the only thing I could tell him was that I did n't know the Secretary of Defense . Once more Kim visited me  --  this time nn September fifteenth  --  when he brought a captain , Oh Bong Soo. as interpreter . This man finally explained to me that the dale was the Korean Thanksgiving Day , on which gifts were exchanged and social calls made . Kim brought me two dozen apples as a gift , also some more questions , just to pass the time of day : How in the world did I think we Could ever win I he war by fighting ; what political party did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacArthur , Marshall and Bradley ? Then suddenly he neked , " Did you know that General MacArthur has been dismissed ' . " I told him that was a great shock to me. but could get no more details from him . By September twentieth I had a lot of dried fish saved , and thought that all I needed was an opportunity to escape . But the guaidm had been tanking ii ... ing about going back to that rebuilt trench and I knew I 'd have to get away before we moved or not at all . From the inside room of a cave escape is too difficult to think about . But again , I lost my opportunity . A day or so later my malaria came back and once more I was flat on my back . But this time I called for medicine after the second day , and again five Atabrine pills pulled me out of it  --  on October first . But that day we went back to a new and enlarged cave , NO I gave up my escape plan and ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , Well , weir probably had general mobilization , and they were n't able to get el full-sealc attack ready , but it 'll come March fifteenth of next year . On March fifteenth , Dean , you'ee got to be in shape to get away and meet them on the beaches . But on October twenty-ninth we moved again . I thought we might be going north and that another United Nations drive might he shaping up , but we went only about three miles , by twisting roads , to a new house built especially for me by the guards , and set into the side of a hill . This was a line concrete structure , the cleanest I 'd seen in North Korea , and although it wile just seven and a half feet by twelve feet , over all , I had a **28;4510;TOOLONG room and even two tiny windows , not big enough to slick my head through , but with real glass . There were even concrete Room with orator flues in them , and I had a bench three feet wide on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing apace in my room was a two-foot aisle . 1 still was n't allowed to stand , but could see out the windows from my bunk . Here we were away from Chinese conceal rations , obviously an important fact , and Dee allowed me a few forty-five-minute suiffieths behind a screen of branches by the house . But a young Korean officer inspecting the place caught me seated on my bench taking calisthenics , and thereafter they were prohibited without special perm Minim . But suddenly on December nineteenth . Dean 's whole prises life changed . The tine indication was mother visit from Major Kim and Captain Oh , who arrived in a lather about ten P.M. and for once did n't pose new questions about the course of the war . Instead , Kim said , " Would n't you like to write u letter to your wife ? You do n't want your family to worry . Do n't you want to write and tell them you 're all right " " I fell something strange in the air , but 1 said only that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given it to Choe . Both at them then Raid , " Oh , we did n't know about that . " But they in-misted that I should write another . anyhow ? and write it that night . Kim provided pen and paper , and seated me at a wobbly little table in the main room . That house was wired for electricity , but the bombers had been busy on the transmission lines , so we had only an oil can with n wick in it for light . Alen , I had been without any sort of pen or pencil in my bandit , except to make el fen* figures , for sixteen months , SO I had trouble . I was horrified . My , N " s looked like M 's , and my M 's like nothing legible . When I struggled through a letter to Mildred and tried to rend it , I could n't even make it out myself , so I rewrote it twice more . Then Oh read it aloud in Korean , but it would n't do because I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . I have just been told that I can have a pencil and that I can write to you ? " That pert about a pencil would n't do , Kim said . So I did the letter over ? foolimhly , without insisting that they read the whole of it first . So the next version also was turned down  --  this time because in the text I hail written : " I have n't seen a fellow American since July , 1950 . " Version No. 5 finally was O.K. 'd well after midnight . But Kim then said , " Who else do you want to write to ? " EVENING POST I said , " I do n't want to write to anyone else tonight . write tom orra w . " But he said , " Oh . no . It must he tonight . " So finally I wrote another letter , this to my daughter , and dated it the twentieth . And that time I had only to /nuke two copies to get one legible . When I said I simply was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally left , carrying my letters , also some photos taken at Pyongyang shortly after my capture , and which I had signed that night . In January , when I got my first mail , I learned what all the rush had been ; those two letters of mine were turned over to United Nations repreiientatives ern the lust letters in the original exchange of prisoner mail , on December twenty-fourth . ) But I slept very little that night . I was excited about having a pencil ; and in the morning I had another visitor . This was ii major general , no less , named Lee . And with him was my old chum , Lieutenant Colonel Choe . This gave me an opportunity for which I 'd been waiting , and I let Chat- have it . One of the first things I said was , " Thin id the man who told me 1 could wash twice a day , and I 've never been permitted to do it , Why ? " II was getting adept at thee-Own type of phraseology . I I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take up with higher authority my request to go to a POW camp . All right , what does higher authority say about it ? This is the man who gave orders that I was n't to play f ' hong-gun . Why ? " The general was making a big act . out of being friendly , so I really poured it on Choe . But he wiggled . He said , " Oh , I did n't any you could n't play Chonggun . ' ' I said , " Then why was I stopped immediately after you visited me on the third of December last year ? As soon am you left , the guards said they had orders  --  what is that ? " Choe said , " That must have been Colonel Kim who gave those orders . " The general still was friendly , but answered few questions , uml said nothing to my other demands : for exercise , for sunbathe , for something to read . I never learned what , if anything , he did to Choe , but he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having permitted such orders to stand and for my general treatment .

February 20 , MI But this day everything was jest dandy . The general did n't like the this pad on my bed , so it was replaced by one much thicker . He ordered a sheet for me , so an aide brought in a strip g cotton about twenty inches wide and seven and a half feet long . I never figured out what to do with it . Then to replace my summer-weight suit , the aide produced a pin-stripe woolen made in Eastern Germany , also a new shirt , but this was so small that could n't fasten the collar , and the alcoves caught me at about the elbows . So that was taken away , but t hey forgot to bring another . Finally , Lee suggested that I mull have a drink with him . The aide brought in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devilfish , black fish eggs and sake . We eat down , and the general began to ask questions : What did I think about the war ? Did I think we had any chance at an ? Then he launched into a mtaternent , the gist of which was that we could n't possibly win . We had n't been able to beat them when they were at their lowest point , so we never could . They had solved their main problem , transportation , end how they were getting stronger all the time . No matter what we did , we could never make it es bed as it already had  --  been . There was only one ultimate victor : the Korean People 's Army . I did n't do much talking because I Was too busy eating . The butter was delicious and this with the first sliced bread I 'd seen . The lieh eggs and devil . fish also were wonderful .
