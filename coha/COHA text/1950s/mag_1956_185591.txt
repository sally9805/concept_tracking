Even for Texas , the fight was savage . Governor Allan Shivers , unbeaten and still packing a wallop after two decades in politics , was the official champ . Senator Lyndon Johnson , fast and clever , and seconded by implacable old House Speaker Sam Rayburn , was the challenger . The prize : control of the Texas Democratic Party , including its 56-vote delegation to the national convention . Last week , at more than 5,000 precinct meetings in 254 counties , Lyndon Johnson gave Allan Shivers a merciless drubbing , then added a couple of sharp kicks to make certain he would not get up . <P> Sam Rayburn had been setting Shivers up for the kill ever since 1952 , when Shivers bolted his party and led Texas into the Eisenhower column . Picking his instrument of revenge . Mistuh Sam threw his vast party influence behind his longtime protege , Johnson , and labored mightily to build Johnson 's prestige . Rayburn 's plans were almost wrecked when Johnson suffered a heart attack last year . But Allan Shivers was in trouble too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state that likes its governors to retire gracefully after two ; his administration was rocked by land and insurance scandals ( TIME , Aug. 8 ) . <P> Last March Rayburn moved fast : he proposed that Texas go to the national convention with Johnson in the dual role of favorite-son candidate and delegation chairman . Governor Shivers , anxious for a truce , agreed to the favorite-son proposition-but he was bound and determined that , come what may , he would himself head the delegation . And he made it clear that he would feel free to throw Texas to the Republicans again if the Democrats nominated someone , e.g. , Adlai Stevenson , who was not to his liking . Shivers turned down Rayburn 's proposal , attacked Johnson personally-and the fight was on . <P> It centered on last week 's precinct meetings , where victory would give control of the county and state conventions . Shivers campaigned wildly , nailing about on all sides . Johnson , he cried , was " vain , ambitious and vicious , " and was " playing footsie " with left-wingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become one " of errand boys bound body and soul in advance to deliver the Texas votes whenever and where Mr. Sam decrees . " <P> <P> Brownell 's Puppet ? Lyndon Johnson , relaxed , affable , appearing to enjoy the brawl , moved tirelessly around the state on handshaking tours , cracking at Shivers as a " Little Lord Fauntleroy with no place to go . " Learning that Republican Attorney General Herbert Brownell had gone secretly to Woodville for a conference with Shivers last month , Johnson cried : " Allan Shivers is nothing but a puppet in Brownell 's hands . " Blasting away even more lustily was angry Sam Rayburn , who described the Shivers campaign as " rat alley politics " and called Shivers himself a " frustrated , unhappy , desperate man who knows he 's going down for the last time . " <P> <P> On the day of the precinct meetings , Lyndon Johnson showed up at his Johnson City caucus in khaki shirt and trousers , was promptly elected chairman . The first returns , from rural areas , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as centers of overwhelming Shivers strength , were still to be heard from . The city results were stunning : Shivers barely held Dallas , while Fort Worth , Houston and El Paso went to Johnson . The rout was complete .
