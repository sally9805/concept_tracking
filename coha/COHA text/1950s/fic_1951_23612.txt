Cyclists ' Raid A Story by Frank Rooney Drawings by David Berger j OEL Bleeker , owner and operator of the Pendleton Hotel , was adjusting the old redwood clock in the lobby when he heard the sound of the motors . At first he thought it might be one of those four-engine planes on the flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco which occasionally got far enough off course to be heard in the valley . And for a moment , braced against the steadily approaching vibrations of the sound , he had the fantastic notion that the plane was going to strike the hotel . He even glanced at his daughter , Cathy , standing a few feet to his right and staring curiously at the street . Then with his fingers still on the hour hand of the clock he realized that the sound was not something coming down from the air but the high , sputtering racket of many vehicles moving along the ground . Cathy and Bret Timmons , who owned one of the two drugstores in the town , went out onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad watch he pulled from his vest pocket and moving the hour hand on the clock forward a minute and a half . He stepped back deliberately , shut the glass case and looked at the huge brass numbers and the two ornate brass pointers . It was eight minutes after seven , approximately twenty-two minutes until sundown . He put the railroadwatch back in his pocket and walked slowly and incuriously through the open doors of the lobby . He was methodical and orderly and the small things he did every day  --  like setting the clock  --  were important to him . He was not to be hurried  --  especially by something as elusively irritating as a sound , however unusual . HERE were only three people on the veranda when Bleeker came out of the lobby  --  his daughter Cathy , Timmons , and Francis LaSalle , co-owner of LaSalle and Fleet , Hardware . They stood together quietly , looking , without appearing to stare , at a long stern column of red motorcycles coming from the south , filling the single main street of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crackling of exhaust pipes . They could see now that the column was led by a single white motorcycle which when it came abreast of the hotel turned abruptly right and stopped . They saw too that the column without seeming to slow down or to execute any elaborate movement had divided itself into two single files . At the approximate second , having received a signal from their leader , they also turned right and stopped . The whole flanking action , singularly neat and quite like the various vehicular forma-tions he remembered in the Army , was distasteful to Bleeker . It recalled a little too readily his tenure as a lieutenant colonel overseas in England , France , and finally Germany . " Mr. Bleeker ? " Bleeker realized the whole troop  --  no one in the town either then or after that night was ever agreed on the exact number of men in the troop  --  had dismounted and that the leader was addressing him . " I 'm Bleeker . " Although he had n't intended to , he stepped forward when he spoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he commanded a battalion . " I 'm Gar Simpson and this is Troop B of the Angeleno Motorcycle Club , " the leader said . He was a tall , spare man and his voice was coldly courteous to the point of mockery . " We expect to bivouac outside your town tonight and we wondered if we might use the facilities of your hotel . Of course , sir , we 'll pay . " " There 's a washroom downstairs . If you can put up with that ? " " That will be fine , sir . Is the dining room still open ? " " It is . " " Could you take care of twenty men ? ' " What about the others ? " They can be accommodated elsewhere , sir . " Simpson saluted casually and , turning to the men assembled stiffly in front of the hotel , issued a few quiet orders . Quickly and efficiently , the men in the troop parked their motorcycles at the curb . About a third of the group detached itself and came deferentially but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself maneuvered aside and went into the lobby . As they passed him , Bleeker could see the slight converted movement of their faces  --  though not their eyes , which were covered by large green goggles  --  toward his daughter Cathy . Bleeker frowned after them but before he could think of anything to say , Simpson , standing now at his left , touched his arm . " I 've divided the others into two groups , " he said quietly . " One group will eat at the diner and the other at the Desert Hotel . " " Very good , " Bleeker said . " You evidently know the town like a book . The people too . Have you ever been here before ? " " We have a map of all the towns in this part of California , sir . And of course we know the names of all the principal hotels and their proprietors . Personally , I could use a drink . Would you join me ? " " After you , " Bleeker said . He stood watching Simpson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bar . Then he turned to Cathy , seeing Timmons and LaSalle lounging on the railing behind her , their faces already indistinct in the plummeting California twilight . " You go help in the kitchen , Cathy , " Bleeker said . " I think it 'd be better if you did n't wait on tables . " " I wonder what they look like behind those goggles , " Cathy said . " Like anybody else , " Timmons said . He was about thirty , somewhat coarse and intolerant and a little embarrassed at being in love with a girl as young as Cathy . " Where did you think they came from ? Mars ? " " What did they say the name of their club was ? " Cathy said . " Angeleno , " LaSalle said . " They must be from Los Angeles . Heigh-ho . Shall I wear my very best gingham , citizen colonel ? " " Remember now  --  you stay in the kitchen , " Bleeker said . He watched her walk into the lobby , a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of the brittle independence of her mother . Bleeker remembered suddenly , although he tried not to , the way her mother had walked away from him that frosty January morning two years ago saying , " I 'm going for a ride . " And then the two-day search in the mountains after the horse had come back alone and the finding of her body ? the neck broken  --  in the stream at the foot of the cliff . During the war he had never really believed that he would live to get back to Cathy 's mother and after the war he had n't really believed he would be separated from her  --  not again  --  not twice in so short a time . S MAKING his head  --  as if by that motion he could shed his memories as easily as a clog sheds water  --  Bleeker went in to join Gar Simpson who was sitting at a table in the barroom . Simpson stood politely when Bleeker took the opposite chair . " How long do you fellows plan to stay ? " Bleeker asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up , and stared at Simpson . - Tonight and tomorrow morning , " Simpson said . Like all the others he was dressed in a brown windbreaker , khaki shirt , khaki pants , and as Bleeker had previously observed wore dark calf-length boots . A cloth and leather helmet lay on the table beside Simpson 's drink , but he had n't removed his fiat green goggles , an accouterment giving him and the men in his troop the appearance of some tropical tribe with enormous semi-precious eyes , lidless and immovable . That was Bleeker 's first impression and , absurd as it was , it did n't seem an exaggeration of fancy but of truth . " Where do you go after this ? " " North . " Simpson took a rolled map from a binocular case slung over his shoulder and spread it on the table . " Roughly we 're following the arc of an ellipse with its southern tip based on Los Angeles and its northern end touching Fresno . " " Pretty ambitious for a motorcycle club . " " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our first week but we 're in no hurry and we 're out to see plenty of country . " " What are you interested in mainly ? " " Roads . Naturally , being a motorcycle club  - -  - you 'd be surprised at the rate we 're expanding  --  we 'd like to have as much of California as possible opened up to us . " " I see. - " Keeps the boys fit too . The youth of America . Our hope for the future . " Simpson pulled sternly at his drink and Bleeker had the impression that Simpson was repressing , openly , and with pride , a vast sparkling ecstasy . B LEEKER sat and watched the young men in the troop file upstairs from the public washroom and stroll casually but nevertheless with discipline into the dining room . They had removed their helmets and strapped them to their belts , each helmet in a prescribed position to the left of the belt-buckle but  --  like Simpson  --  they had retained their goggles . Bleeker wondered if they ever removed the goggles long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh under them looked like . " I think I 'd better help out at the tables . " Bleeker said . He stood up and Simpson stood with him . " You say you 're from Troop 13 ? Is that right ? " " Correct . We 're forming Troop G now . Someday ? " " You 'll be up to Z , " Bleeker said . " And not only in California . " " Where else for instance ? " " Nevada  --  Arizona  --  Colorado -- Wyoming . " Simpson smiled and Bleeker , turning away from him abruptly , went into the dining room where he began to help the two waitresses at the tables . He filled water glasses , set out extra forks , and brought steins of beer from the bar . As he served the troop , their polite thank yous , ornate and insincere , irritated him . It reminded him of tricks taught to animals , the animals only being allowed to perform under certain obvious conditions of security . And he did n't like the cool way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixtures in the town and then leaned their heads together as if every individual thought had to be pooled and divided equally among them . He admitted , after some covert study , that the twenty men were really only variations of one , the variations , with few exceptions , being too subtle for him to recognize and differentiate . It was the goggles , he decided , covering that part of the face which is most noteworthy and most needful for identification  --  the eyes and the mask around the eyes . Bleeker went into the kitchen , pretending to help but really to be near Cathy . The protective father , he thought ironically , watching his daughter cut pie and lay the various colored wedges on the white blue-bordered plates . " Well , Daddy , what 's the verdict ? " Cathy looked extremely grave but he could see that she was amused . " They 're a fine body of men . " " Uh-huh . Have you called the police yet ? " He laughed . " It 's a good thing you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She slid the last piece of blueberry pie on a plate . " I saw you through the door . You looked like you were ready to crack the Siegfried line  --  single-handed . " " That man Simpson . " " What about him ? " " Why do n't you go upstairs and read a book or something ? " " Now , Daddy  --  you 're the only professional here . They 're just acting like little tin soldiers out on a spree . " " I wish to God they were made of tin . " " All right . I 'll keep away from them . I promise . " She made a gesture of crossing her throat with the thin edge of a knife . He leaned over and kissed her forehead , his hand feeling awkward and stern on her back . After dinner the troop went into the bar , moving with a strange co-ordinated fluency that was both casual and military and sat jealously together in one corner of the room . Bleeker served them pitchers of beer and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center , their voices guarded and urgent as if they possessed information which could n't be disseminated safely among the public . Bleeker left them after a while and went upstairs to his daughter 's room . He was n't used to being severe with Cathy and he was a little embarrassed by what he had said to her in the kitchen . She was turning the collars of some of his old shirts , using a portable sewing machine he had bought her as a present on her last birthday . As he came in she held one of the shirts comically to the floor lamp and he could see how thin and transparent the material was . Her mother 's economy in small things , almost absurd when compared to her limitless generosity in matters of importance , had been one of the family jokes . It gave him an extraordinary sense of pleasure , so pure it was like a sudden inhalation of oxygen , to see that his daughter had not only inherited this tradition but had considered it meaningful enough to carry on . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further to her . Cathy was what he himself was in terms which could mean absolutely nothing to anyone else . H E IIAD been in his room for perhaps an hour , working on the hotel accounts and thinking obliquely of the man Simpson , when he heard , faintly and apparently coming from no one direction , the sound of singing . He got up and walked to the windows overlooking the street . Standing there , he thought he could fix the sound farther up the block toward Cunningham 's bar . Except for something harsh and mature in the voices it was the kind of singing that might be heard around a Boy Scout campfire , more rhythmic than melodic and more stirring than tuneful . And then he could hear it almost under his feet , coming out of the hotel lobby and making three or four people on the street turn and smile foolishly toward the doors of the veranda . Oppressed by something sternly joyous in the voices . Bleeker went downstairs to the bar , hearing as he approached the singing become louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the troop there were only three townsmen  --  including LaSalle  --  in the bar . Simpson , seeing Bleeker in the door , got up and walked over to him , moving him out into the lobby where they could talk . " I hope the boys are n't disturbing you , " he said . " It 's early , " Bleeker said . " In an organization as large and selective as ours it 's absolutely necessary to insist on a measure of discipline . And it 's equally necessary to allow a certain amount of relaxation . " " The key word is selective , I suppose . " " We have our standards , " Simpson said primly . " May I ask just what the hell your standards are ? " Simpson smiled . " I do n't quite understand your irritation , Mr. Bleeker . " " This is an all-year-round thing , is n't it ? This club of yours ? " " Yes . " " And you have an all-year-round job with the club ? " " Of course . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply stated , what you 're running is a privatearmy . " Bleeker tapped the case slung over Simpson 's shoulder . " Complete with maps , all sorts of local information , and of course a lobby in Sacramento . " " For a man who has traveled as widely as you have , Mr. Bleeker , you display an uncommon talent for exaggeration . " " As long as you behave yourselves I do n't care what you do . This is a small town and we do n't have many means of entertainment . We go to bed at a decent hour and I suggest you take that into consideration . However , have your fun . Nobody here has any objections to that . " " And of course we spend our money . " " Yes , " Bleeker said . " You spend your money . " He walked away from Simpson and went out onto the veranda . The singing was now both in front and in back of him . Bleeker stood for a moment on the top steps of the veranda looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminous pennant in the sky . He was embarrassed by his outburst to Simpson and he could n't think why he had said such things . Private army . Perhaps , as Simpson had said , he was exaggerating . He was a small-town man and he had always hated the way men surrendered their individuality to attain perfection as a unit . It had been necessary during the war but it was n't necessary now . Kid stuff  --  with an element of growing pains . H E WALKED down the steps and went up the sidewalk toward Cunningham 's bar . They were singing there too and he stood outside the big plate-glass window peering in at them and listening to the harsh , pounding voices colored here and there with the sentimentalism of strong beer . ' Without thinking further he went into the bar . It was dim and cool and alien to his eyes and at first he did n't notice the boy sitting by himself in a booth near the front . When he did , he was surprised  --  more than surprised , shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goggles but had placed them on the table by a bottle of Coca-Cola . Impulsively , he walked over to the booth and sat across from the boy . " This seat taken ? " He had to shout over the noise of the singing . The boy leaned forward over the table and smiled . CYCLISTS ' RAID " Hope we 're not disturbing you . " Bleeker caught the word " disturbing " and shook his head negatively . He pointed to his mouth , then to the boy and to the rest of the group . The boy too shook his head . Blecker could see that he was young , possibly twenty-five , and that he had dark straight hair cut short and parted neatly at the side . The face was square but delicate , the nose short , the mouth wide . The best thing about the boy , Bleeker decided , were his eyes , brown perhaps or dark gray , set in two distorted ovals of white flesh which contrasted sharply with the heavily tanned skin on the cheeks , forehead and jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest . Without them he was a pleasant young man , altogether human and approachable . Bleeker pointed to the Coca-Cola bottle . " You 're not drinking . " " Beer makes me sick . " Bleeker got the word " beer " and the humorous ulping motion the boy made . They sat exchanging words and sometimes phrases , illustrated always with a series of clumsy , groping gestures until the singing became less coherent and spirited and ended finally in a few isolated coughs . The men in the troop were moving about individually now , some leaning over the bar and talking in hoarse whispers to the bartender , others walking unsteadily from group to group and detaching themselves immediately to go over to another group , the groups usually two or three men constantly edging away from themselves and colliding with and being held briefly by others . Some simply stood in the center of the room and brayed dolorously at the ceiling . Several of the troop walked out of the bar and Bleeker could see them standing on the wide sidewalk looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's company as they had been glad of it earlier . Or not so much contemptuous as unwilling to be coerced too easily by any authority outside themselves . Bleeker smiled as he thought of Simpson and the man 's talk of discipline . " They 're looking for women , " the boy said . Bleeker had forgotten the boy temporarily and the sudden words spoken in a normal voice startled and confused him . He thought quickly of Cathy  --  but then Cathy was safe in her room  --  probably in bed . He took the watch from his vest pocket and looked at it carefully . " Five minutes after ten , " he said . " Why do they do that ? " the boy demanded . " Why do they have to be so damned indecent about things like that ? Thcy have n't got the nerve to do anything but stare at waitresses . And then they get a few beers in them and go around pinching and slapping  --  they --  " Bleeker shivered with embarrassment . He was looking directly into the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jerky pinching movement of the lids as against something injurious and baleful . It was an emotion too rawly infantile to be seen without being hurt by it and he felt both pity and contempt for a man who would allow himself to display such a feeling  --  without any provocation  --  so nakedly to a stranger . " Sorry , " the boy said . He picked up the green goggles and fitted them awkwardly over his eyes . Bleeker stood up and looked toward the center of the room . Several of the men turned their eyes and then moved their heads away without seeming to notice the boy in the booth . Bleeker understood them . This was the one who could be approached . The reason for that was clear too . He did n't belong . Why and wherefore he would probably never know . H E WALKED out of the bar and started down the street toward the hotel . The night was clear and cool and smelled faintly of the desert , of sand , of heated rock , of the sweetly-sour plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself into the earth and never completely withdrew . There were only a few townsmen on the sidewalk wandering up and down , lured by the presence of something unusual in the town and masking , Bleeker thought , a ruthless and menacing curiosity behind a tolerant grin . He shrugged his shoulders distastefully . He was like a cat staring into a shadow the shape of its fears . He was no more than a hundred feet from the hotel when he heard  --  or thought he heard ? the sound of automatic firing . It was a well-remembered sound but always new and frightening . Then he saw the motorcycle moving down the middle of the street , the exhaust sputtering loudly against the human resonance of laughter , catcalls , and epithets . He exhaled gently , the pain in his lungs subsiding with his breath . Another motorcycle speeded after the first and he could see four or five machines being wheeled out and the figures of their riders leaping into the air and bringing their weight down on the starting pedals . He was aware too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street had turned and were speeding back to the hotel . He had the sensation of moving  --  even when he stood still  --  in relation to the objects heading toward each other . He heard the high unendurable sound of metal squeezing metal and saw the front wheel of a motorcycle twist and wobble and its rider roll along the asphalt toward the gutter where he sat up finally and moved his goggled head feebly from side to side . As Bleeker looked around him he saw the third group of men which had divided earlier from the other two coining out of a bar across the street from Cunningham 's , waving their arms in recognizable motions of cheering . The boy who had been thrown from the motorcycle vomited quietly into the gutter . Bleeker walked very fast toward the hotel . When he reached the top step of the veranda , he was caught and jostled by some five or six cyclists running out of the lobby , one of whom fell and was kicked rudely down the steps . Sleeker staggered against one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for a moment , fighting his temper , and then went into the lobby . A table had been overthrown and lay on its top , the wooden legs stiffly and foolishly exposed , its magazines scattered around it , some with their pages spread face down so that the bindings rose along the back . He stepped on glass and realized one of the panes in the lobby door had been smashed . One of the troop walked stupidly out of the bar , his body sagging against the impetus propelling him forward until without actually falling he lay stretched on the floor , beer gushing from his mouth and nose and making a green and yellow pool before it sank into the carpet . As Bleeker walked toward the bar , thinking of Simpson and of what he could say to him , he saw two men going up the stairs toward the second floor . He ran over to intercept them . Recognizing the authority in his voice , they came obediently down the stairs and walked across the lobby to the veranda , one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay  --  keep your lid on . " The smile they exchanged enraged him . After they were out of sight he ran swiftly up the stairs , panting a little , and along the haIl to his daughter 's room . It was quiet and there was no strip of light beneath the door . He stood listening for a moment with his ear to the panels and then turned back toward the stairs . A man or boy , any of twenty or forty or sixty identical figures , goggled and in khaki , came around the corner of the second-floor corridor and put his hand on the knob of the door nearest the stairs . He squeezed the knob gently and then moved on to the next door , apparently unaware of Bleeker . Bleeker , remembering not to run or shout or knock the man down , walked over to him , took his arm and led him down the stairs , the arm unresisting , even flaccid , in his grip . Sleeker stood indecisively at the foot of the stairs , watching the man walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back upstairs and search the hall . And he thought too he had to reach Simpson . Over the noise of the motorcycles moving rapidly up and clown the street he heard a crash in the bar , a series of drunken elongated curses , ending abruptly in a small sound like a man 's hand laid flatly and sharply on a table . His head was beginning to ache badly and his stomach to sour under the impact of a slow and steady anger . He walked into the bar and stood staring at Francis LaSalle ? LaSalle and Fleet , Hardware  --  who lay sprawled on the floor , his shoulders touching the brass rail under the bar and his head turned so that his cheek rubbed the black polished wood above the rail . The bartender had his hands below the top of the bar and he was watching Simpson and a half a dozen men arranged in a loose semi-circle above and beyond LaSalle . Bleeker lifted LaSalle , who was a little dazed but not really hurt , and set him on a chair . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Simpson . " Get your men together , " he said . " And get them out of here . " Simpson took out a long yellow wallet folded like a book and laid some money on the bar . " That should take care of the damages , " he said . His tongue was a little thick and his mouth did n't quite shut after the words were spoken but Bleeker did n't think he was drunk . Bleeker saw too  --  or thought he saw  --  the little cold eyes behind the glasses as bright and as sterile as a painted floor . Bleeker raised his arm slightly and lifted his heels off the floor but Simpson turned abruptly and walked away from him , the men in the troop swaying at his heels like a pack of lolling hounds . Bleeker stood looking foolishly after them . He had expected a fight and his body was still poised for one . He grunted heavily . " Who hit him ? " Bleeker motioned toward LaSalle . " Damned if I know , " the bartender said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was true of course . He went back into the lobby , hearing LaSalle say , weakly and tearfully , " Goddam them  --  the bastards . " He met Campbell , the deputy sheriff , a tall man with the arms and shoulders of a child beneath a foggy , bloated face . " Can you do anything ? " Bleeker asked . The motorcycles were racing up and down the street , alternately whining and backfiring and one had jumped the curb and was cruising on the sidewalk . " What do you want me to do ? " Campbell demanded . " Put ' em all in jail ? " The motorcycle on the sidewalk speeded up and skidded obliquely into a plate-glass window , the front wheel bucking and climbing the brick base beneath the window . A single large section of glass slipped edge-down to the sidewalk and fell slowly toward the cyclist who , with his feet spread and kicking at the cement , backed clumsily away from it . Bleeker could feel the crash in his teeth . ow there were other motorcycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car at the edge of the walk . The rider standing astride his machine beat the window out of the car with his gloved fists . Campbell started down the steps toward him but was driven back by a motorcycle coming from his left . Bleeker could hear the squeal of the tires against the wooden riser at the base of the steps . Campbell 's hand was on his gun when Bleeker reached him . " That 's no good , " he yelled . " Get the state police . Ask for a half dozen squad cars . " Campbell , angry but somewhat relieved , went up the steps and into the lobby . Bleeker could n't know how long he stood on the veranda watching the mounting devastation on the street  --  the cyclist racing past store windows and hurling , presumably , beer bottles at the glass fronts ; the two , working as a team , knocking down weighing machines and the signs in front of the motion picture theater ; the innumerable mounted men running the angry townspeople , alerted and aroused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their suddenly lighted homes again or up the steps of his hotel or into niches along the main street , into doorways , and occasionally into the ledges and bays of glassless windows . He saw Simpson  --  or rather a figure on the white motorcycle , helmeted and goggled  --  stationed calmly in the middle of the street under a hanging lamp . Presumably , lie had been there for some time but Bleeker had n't seen him , the many rapid movements on the street making any static object unimportant and even , in a sense , invisible . Bleeker saw him now and he felt again that spasm of anger which was like another life inside his body . He could have strangled Simpson then , slowly and with infinite pride . He knew without any effort of reason that Simpson was making no attempt to control his men but waiting rather for that moment when their minds , subdued but never actually helpless , would again take possession of their bodies . Bleeker turned suddenly and went back into the lobby as if by that gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , hereafter , would be responsible for them . He walked over the desk where Timmons and Campbell , the deputy , were talking . " You 've got the authority , " Timmons was saying angrily . " Fire over their heads . And if that does n't stop them ? " Campbell looked uneasily at Bleeker . " Maybe if we could get their leader ? " " Did you get the police ? " Bleeker asked . " They 're on their way , " Campbell said . He avoided looking at Timmons and continned to stare hopefully and miserably at Bleeker . " You 've had your say , " Timmons said abruptly . " Now I 'll have mine . " He started for the lobby doors but Campbell , suddenly incensed , grabbed his arm . " You leave this to me , " he said . " You start firing a gun ? " Campbell 's month dropped and Bleeker , turning his head , saw the two motorcycles coming through the lobby doors . They circled leisurely around for a moment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goggled rider looming enormously above the wide handlebars . They scattered , Bleeker diving behind a pillar and Campbell and Timmons jumping behind the desk . The noise of the two machines assaulted them with as much effect as the sight of the speeding metal itself . Bleeker did n't know why in course of watching the two riders he looked into the hall toward the foot of the stairway . Nor did it seem at all unreasonable that when he looked he should see Cathy standing there . Deeply , underneath the outward preoccupation of his mind , he must have been thinking of her . Now there she was . She wore the familiar green robe , belted and pulled in at the waist and beneath its hem he could see the white slippers and the pink edge of her nightgown . Her hair was down and he had the impression her eyes were not quite open although , obviously , they were . She looked , he thought , as if she had waked , frowned at the clock , and come downstairs to scold him for staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . He saw  --  and of course Cathy saw  --  the motorcycle speeding toward her . He was aware that he screamed at her too . She did take a slight backward step and raise her arms in a pathetic warding gesture toward the inhuman figure on the motorcycle but neither could have changed  --  in that dwarfed period of time and in that short , unmaneuverable space  --  the course of their actions . She lay finally across the lower steps , her body clinging to and equally arching away from the base of the newel post . And there was the sudden , shocking exposure of her flesh , the robe and the gown torn away from the leg as if pushed aside by the blood welling from her thigh . When he reached her there was blood in her hair too and someone  --  not Cathy  --  was screaming into his ears . AFT ER a while the doctor came and Cathy , her head bandaged and her leg in splints , could be carried into his office and laid on the couch . Bleeker sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathy 's , watching the still white face whose eyes were closed and would not , he knew , open again . The doctor , after his first examination , had looked up quickly and since Bleeker too had been bent over Cathy , their heads had been very close together for a moment . The doctor had assumed , almost immediately , his expression of professional austerity but Bleeker had seen him in that moment when he had been thinking as a man , fortified of course by a doctor 's knowledge , and Bleeker had known then that Cathy would die but that there would be also this interval of time . Bleeker turned from watching Cathy and saw Timmons standing across the room . The man was  --  or had been  --  crying but his face was n't set for it and the tears , points of colorless , sparkling water on his jaws , were unexpectedly delicate against the coarse texture of his skin . Timmons waved a bandaged hand awkwardly and Bleeker remembered , abruptly and jarringly , seeing Timmons diving for the motorcycle which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the lobby . There was no sound now either from the street or the lobby . It was incredible , thinking of the racket a moment ago , that there should be this utter quietude , not only the lack of noise but the lack of the vibration of movement . The doctor came and went , coming to bend over Cathy and then going away again . Timmons stayed . Beyond shifting his feet occasionally he did n't move at all but stood patiently across the room , his face toward Cathy and Bleeker - but not , Bleeker thought once when he looked up , actually seeing them . " The police , " Bleeker said sometime later . " They 're gone , " Timmons said in a hoarse whisper . And then after a while , " They 'll get ' em  --  do n't worry . " Bleeker saw that the man blushed helplessly and looked away from him . The police were no good . They would catch Simpson . Simpson would pay damages . And that would be the end of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor Timmons nor Campbell . They were all alike . They were standardized figurines , seeking in each other a willful loss of identity , dividing themselves equally among one another until there was only a single mythical figure , unspeakably sterile and furnishing the norm for hundreds of others . He could not accuse something which did n't actually exist . He was n't sure of the exact moment when Cathy died . It might have been when he heard the motorcycle , unbelievably solitary in the quiet night , approaching the town . He knew only that the doctor came for the last time and that there was now a coarse , heavy blanket laid mercifully over Cathy . He stood looking down at the blanket for a moment , whatever he was feeling repressed and delayed inside him , and then went back to the lobby and out onto the veranda . There were a dozen men standing there looking up the street toward the sound of the motorcycle , steadily but slowly coming nearer . He saw that when they glanced at each other their faces were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were respectful and a little abashed . B LEEKER could see from the veranda a number of people moving among the smashed store-fronts , moving , stopping , bending over and then straightening up to move somewhere else , all dressed somewhat extemporaneously and therefore seeming without purpose . What they picked up they put down . What they put down they stared at grimly and then picked up again . They were like a dispossessed minority brutally but /awfully discriminated against . When the motorcycle appeared at the north end of the street they looked at it and then looked away again , dully and seemingly without resentment . It was only after some moments that they looked up again , this time purposefully , and began to move slowly toward the hotel where the motorcycle had now stopped , the rider standing on the sidewalk , his face raised to the veranda . No one on the veranda moved until Bleeker , after a visible effort , walked down the steps and stood facing the rider . It was the boy Bleeker had talked to in the bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could n't stand it any longer , " the boy said . " I had to come back . " He looked at Bleeker as if he did n't dare look anywhere else . His face was adolescently shiny and damp , the marks , Bleeker thought , of a proud and articulate fear . He should have been heroic in his willingness to come back to the town after what had been done to it but to Bleeker he was only a dirty little boy returning to a back fence his friends had defaced with pornographic writing and calling attention to the fact that he was afraid to erase the writing but was determined nevertheless to do it , Bleeker was revoked . He hated the boy far more than he could have hated Simpson for bringing this to his attention when he did not want to think of anything or anyone but Cathy . " I was n't one of them , " the boy said . " You remember , Mr. Bleeker . I was n't drinking . " This declaration of innocence  --  this willingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  enraged Bleeker . " You were one of them , " he said . " Yes . But after tonight ? " " Why did n't you stop them ? " Bleeker demanded loudly . He felt the murmur of the townspeople at his back and someone breathed harshly on his neck . " You were one of them . You could have done something . Why in God 's name did n't you do it ? " " What could I do ? " the boy said . He spread his hands and stepped back as if to appeal to the men beyond Bleeker . Bleeker could n't remember , either shortly after or much later , exactly what he did then . If the boy had n't stepped back like that  --  if he had n't raised his hand . . Bleeker was in the middle of a group of bodies and he was striking with his fists and being struck . And then he was kneeling on the sidewalk , holding the boy 's head in his lap and trying to protect him from the heavy shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protesting , exhorting , and after a time the men moved away from him and someone helped him carry the boy up the steps and lay him on the veranda . When he looked up finally only Timmons and the doctor were there . Up and down the street there were now only shadows and the diminishing sounds of invisible bodies . The night was still again as abruptly as it had been confounded with noise . S OME time later Timmons and the doctor carried the boy , alive but terribly hurt , into the hotel . Bleeker sat on the top step of the veranda , staring at the moon which had shifted in the sky and was now nearer the mountains in the west . It was not in any sense romantic or inflamed but coldly clear and sane . And the light it sent was cold and sane and lit in himself what he would have liked to hide . He could have said that having lost Cathy he was not afraid any longer of losing himself . No one would blame him . Cathy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the sidewalk , and stamping on him as he had never believed he could leave stamped on any living thing . No one would say he should have lost Cathy lightly ? without anger and without that appalling desire to avenge her . It was utterly natural  --  as natural as a man drinking a few beers and riding a ' motorcycle insanely through a town like this . Bleeker shuddered . It might have been all right for a man like Timmons who was and would always be incapable of thinking what he  --  Joel Bleeker  --  was thinking . It was not  --  and would never be  --  all right for him . Bleeker got up and stood for a moment on the top step of the veranda . He wanted , abruptly and madly , to scream his agony into the night with no more restraint than that of an animal seeing his guts beneath him on the ground . He wanted to smash something  --  anything  --  glass , wood , stone  --  his own body . He could feel his fists going into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living thing on the sidewalk and himself stooping over to shield it . After a while , aware that he was leaning against one of the wooden pillars supporting the porch and aware too that his flesh was numb from being pressed against it , he straightened up slowly and turned to go back into the hotel . There would always be time to make his peace with the dead . There was little if any time to make his peace with the living .
