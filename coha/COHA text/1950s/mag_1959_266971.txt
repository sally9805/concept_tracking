A thin , small , birdlike man , peering through heavy horn-rimmed glasses , was presented to reporters in West Berlin last week as the biggest spy catch in years . His name : Siegfried Dombrowski . His former job : deputy chief of East Germany 's military espionage organization , innocently called " Administration for Coordination . " Dombrowski , 42 , told newsmen he had defected " several months ago , " and brought with him long lists of agents and dispatches that he had turned over to the " proper Western authorities . " The total East German apparatus , he declared , involved control of 60,000 agents , with 13,000 of his own agents working undercover in Britain , France , Spain , Italy , West Germany , and in the U.S. installations in Europe . <P> Why had he fled to West Berlin ? To save his skin , for he feared that his superiors were going to " fry " him because one of his aides had been discovered to be a double agent , and also because a relative had recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nazi concentration camps , " said Dombrowski candidly . " I did not want another dose of it . " <P> Dombrowski 's defection was welcomed not only for the information he brought , but as a badly needed shot in the arm for Western " spook " organizations , which are one of Berlin 's major industries . They have had a bad year . The chief of a West Berlin refugee camp for Russian and Polish defectors last month was arrested and reportedly confessed that he had been working for the Communists since spring . The potent Investigating Committee of Free Jurists , whose network of spies in East Germany helps make life miserable for the Red rulers of that unhappy state , suffered a series of body blows : one of its top officials was exposed by the East Germans as a former Nazi youth leader ; another was captured by the Reds when he went for a sail alone on the Wannsee ; a third confessed he had been working for the Reds from the moment he joined the Jurists in May 1956 . <P> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue trading lefts and rights in Berlin , the climate around them is changing . While applauding the Western underground 's previous services against the Reds-which include everything from smuggling out scientists to sending anonymous warnings to East German authorities that their misdeeds are being recorded - Berlin officials and newspapers have begun to suggest that some of the spook groups are overdoing it . <P> West Berlin 's Mayor Willy Brandt , who regards much of the underground activities as " grownups playing cowboy and Indian . " wants the Berlin senate to examine how to get " rid of certain undesirable activities in the twilight zone of political propaganda . " The spook business is causing dissatisfaction in East Germany , too , but of a different sort . Dombrowski 's boss , Major General Karl Linke , has reportedly been given the boot for letting Dombrowski get away .
