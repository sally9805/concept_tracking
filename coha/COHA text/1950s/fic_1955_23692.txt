The Medicine Men A Story by William Eastlake Drawings by John Groth I - URT HEINITZ was in absolute command of the third foreign-car rally of the Southwest . As he watched the gaudy cars pull into the rendezvous point at La Ventana he did not approve of anything at all . Kurt Heinitz had begun his career with Rommel , achieved full command under Von Modell before lie was switched to Guderian for the big push to Moscow . That the genius of Heinitz , Von Modell , Guderian , and Von Reicheilau had failed was a monument to the insanity of a corporal trying to run things from Berlin . Heinitz had to remind himself occasionally that that was why he was playing with these toy bright cars that were streaming into La Ventana now instead of something real , and he blamed it all on insanity in a politician . But it was not insanity that annoyed him with the Van Esters and the Johnsons , the Jag and the Porsche that were closest to him now . It was plain stupidity which , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Americans . After the war Heinitz had tossed a coin to decide on Russia or America . The coin fell in favor of New Mexico , where he had something important and secret to do even after the American scientist , Oppenheimer , had been denied access to classified material . This amused Kurt Heinitz . Heinitz was still missing nine cars . A slick , temperamental purple Gordini pulled in from ' Socorro . Heinitz was missing eight . The Germans in New Mexico seemed fascinated that Heinitz had ordinanced the punch at Moscow from Yasnaya Polyana . It seemed some writer had lived there once . Sometimes the Germans were as hopeless as the Amer-icans but no one was as hopeless as the John-sons . Heinitz advanced toward them . The Johnsons in the canary yellow and red Jaguar with blown-up fenders looked splendid in identical pink-and-white checked caps with purple pompons , Red Ryder shirts , blue jeans , and cowboy boots , and they were both worried about the same thing  --  Kurt Heinitz . Mrs. Johnson preferred to be known as Helen Hooyar and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that went on when everyone went to bed . The Platter Parade King of the Southwest , Lonesome Johnson . Mrs. Johnson thought that her maiden name should not be allowed to die , that it kept her from being thought of as a housewife . She had records of her singing pressed in Albuquerque under the name of Helen Hooyar ; her husband played them and she had a feeling they were beginning to catch on . Her husband was kind and never showed her the mail . She was kind and did n't tell him she was having an affair with his biggest account . Everyone was kind except Kurt Hcinitz . Why did n't he pick on the Van Esters ? Heinitz hesitated between the two cars and walked toward the Van Esters . Mrs. Van Ester had a thin long face that never relaxed from that set , tight **27;1319;TOOLONG look ? " Is n't this fun !

They were again accoutered in those identical checkered and pomponed caps that seemed to be the thing . But they did not affect the cowboy getup of the Lonesome Johnsons but ran to Tattersall vests and jodhpurs and King Alfonso boots , mail-ordered from the Country Store at Aspen . R AOUL VAN EsrER was an engineer and hated it and was practicing the cello and did not think he was very good . His wife encouraged him and they planned a pilgrimage to Casals in Prades . Last year they had gone to the Mexican Pan American road races instead , and when a Porsche won it they decided to get rid of the Volkswagen because it had a crash box transmission and anyway did not have a sunshine top . The Porsche did n't have a sunshine top either but it did n't have a crash box transmission . Pablo Casals .4 , would have to wait indefinitely . They subscribed to Furioso , Zero , and Botteghe Oscure and , until they folded , Horizon , transition , and Avant . They had all the latest hi-fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , the whole works including the diamond pickup and five-dimensional sound , including the bathroom , eleven hundred and forty bucks . Who could resist ? They were proud that they never joined anything . They went to the Great Books discussion but they were careful never to join . The leader , who had been trained in Chicago and had talked to Dr. Hutchins personally , handled them with kid gloves , but had subjected them to eight-millimeter cultural films which lie had taken with his own hands and which the Van Esters knew were against the rules . The Van Esters had a tape recorder with them this very minute in the car and were going to record cultural Indian chants and play them at the next meeting in their home town of Truth or Consequences . When a public-relations man for a soap company had wanted to pin that name on Hot Springs to boost a TV show , the Van Esters went along for the gag and now they were ashamed . But right now they were afraid ; they were afraid of Heinitz who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their car so they could compete for the Concour d'EMgance prize for cars with over 60,000 miles , and they were afraid of Heinitz . Heinitz came over and touched the scooped door of the Porsche , gentle and relaxed . He wore a nondescript American suit on his long frame that made anything hang with a military assurance . He had emerged from a large , standard American car that was the color of dirt . When Heinitz selected a car he wanted to be inside when he was inside and outside when he was outside and no " Is n't this fun ! " foreign-car nonsense . " Are you enjoying yourselves ? " Heinitz said , quietly . looking down on the Van Esters ' purple pompons . " Swell ! Exciting first pass , " Mr. Van Ester said eagerly , his round face dancing up at Heinitz . " Yes , " Heinitz said slowly , hitting the door a quick bop with his palm and moving away . " By God , I know when I 'm being patronized , Skeets , " Mrs. Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly Truth or Consequences . I grew up with a set in Santa Fe and I know when I 'm being patronized , Skeets . " Mr. Van Ester clasped the purple wheel tightly , looking straight ahead out through the tinted windscreen and over the yellow bonnet . " You 're imagining things , Bullet , " he said toward his wife . " We 're out to have fun . Do n't ruin everything by imagining things . " " Imagining things , Skeets ? Swell ! Exciting first pass ! Jesus must you grovel every time that Kraut shows ? I mean let 's face it , Skeets , we 're people . " " Yes , we 're people , Bullet , " Mr. Van Ester said uncertainly , adjusting his pompon and wiggling his King Alfonso boots nervously . " We 're people , Bullet . " H . EINITZ had placed his hands in back of him and walked up to the Johnsons ' Jaguar as though he were thinking of something far away . The Johnsons seemed to scrunch a little closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been thinking , " Heinitz said without any preliminaries to the Lonesome Johnsons , " how could the Van Esters have put 60,000 miles on their car in so short a time ? I thought from the air scoop it was a ' 53 . Still I could be wrong . " " I remember it was a ' 53 , " Lonesome Johnson said , excited . " November ' 53 . They drove it up to our house nonchalant , as though they still had the Volkswagen , as though nothing had happened , said they wanted to borrow a Miracle Cloth , pretending that 's what they came for , as though nothing had happened . So I gave them the Miracle Cloth and pretended that 's what they came for as though nothing had happened . They got sore . " " Thank you , " Heinitz said , thumping the car before moving away . " Poor show , Loney , " Helen Hooyar said without looking at her husband . - Did you have to squeal on those chaps ? I think it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson said . " And do n't forget we 're interested in that thing ourselves . How do you pronounce it ? " " Concour d'EMgance , " his wife said . " And all the more reason it was a poor show . We 've all heard of a little noblesse oblige and it would be inverted snobbery to pretend we had n't . " IIelen Hooyar removed something from her nose with her pinkie finger . " A bloody , lousy show , Loney . Nothing resembling cricket at all . " " Bull , " Lonesome Johnson said . " That 's what I mean by inverted snobbery , Loney . If you ca n't see it , ca n't you feel it ? " Lonesome Johnson said one word preceded by " oh . " The word , was short and obscene and the Navahocade moved off from an abrupt command by Heinitz , and Helen Hooyar laid down her long cigarette holder on her Apache snakeskin , bag and dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief . " It 's Heinitz , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's making us into brutes . " The Navahocade was headed for an allotment or checkerboard area known as Tonatai because that was what the spot had always been called where the trader had his post . The Aspencade to Jernez had been brilliant under Heinitz ' leadership , and so had the Atomcade to Los Alamos . No one could organize like Heinitz . And Heinitz enjoyed himself . It allowed him to keep his hand in . Tonatai was selected because it was not just a big hole like Grand Canyon or Carlsbad where the tourists and tract-dwellers came by the thousands to gawk and erect platitudes . Nor that some of the Foreign car sportifs were not living in tracts , but it was a temporary thing until something happened that was sure to happen and they could move into that adobe casa in Taos with candles and the right wine . Until then everything was temporary ; they had the plans to prove it . They worked at the plans late at night and they used to argue , moving the right wing over to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But some of the wives were beginning to suspect deep within their secret selves that nothing was going to happen . They began to plant permanent things along the rug of lawn and have expensive children . And when the plans were redrawn again late at night they did n't argue . AN OTHER nice reason for having the Nava-hocadc at Tonatai was that there were no roads . Kurt Heinitz had two MGs working the point , scouting about two miles ahead . The MGs had army-surplus walkie-talkies installed and their tall whip antennas were in touch with Heinitz . Heinitz brought up the rear of the main bode ) , of cars and he was using two Siatas to cover the flank . When the MGs spotted any trouble or difficulty in the terrain they were to contact Heinitz . Heinitz got a message now that the trail had ended at an arroyo and he answered back that he was coming forward on the double . The long string of garish cars parted for Heinitz as he moved forward with his hand on the horn . Some did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the ditch , but there were no complaints . They realized that they had been quite stupid and were turning the Navahocade into a very poor show . When Heinitz arrived at the front his scouts were alongside their pink and chartreuse MGs looking vacantly into a thirty by thirty flood erosion , and making perfect targets , Heinitz thought absently . The wife in the pink MG whose husband had a black eye-patch , herself wore a pink snood and plaid-rimmed very dark glasses which  --  along with her posture in the bucket seat , and despite the fact that she was straddling a case of Schweppes  --  gave her the appearance of a holy woman being patient at Benares . Heinitz assessed the situation immediately and sent the chartreuse to scout the left and the eye-patch to scout down the right bank and contact him when they discovered a crossing . The sky over the Indian country reminded him of no sky he had ever seen before , a sea of almost green shot with orange and long strokes of black . What kind of people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean after the water had been removed ? H EINFIZ received a message now that chartreuse had made contact and he threw his car forward toward the scout . When he reached the chartreuse , an Indian was destroying a crude log bridge across a low point in the arroyo and damned if chartreuse was n't arguing with him . Heinitz grabbed a wrench with quickness of mind and hit the Indian across the skull just in time to save the Navahocade from an embarrassing wait . The Indian had been trying to explain in Navaho that his farm on the other side was just planted to winter rye . He had also tried to explain to the Moving People in his small Spanish , but the Moving People did not seem to speak any language at all . Fortunately Heinitz had arrived just in time to save the situation and Mr. Van Ester wondered aloud where the hell the club would be without Heinitz and Mrs. Van Ester had said , " But a spanner , Skeets ! It 's not quite playing the game to hit one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then in a low voice that was more her own , " We 're not animals , Skeets . " Mr. Van Ester scented to think about this a minute before he said profoundly , " Biologically I suppose we are , Bullet . Yes , and by the by , who 's got the tonic ? " " I do n't want to play any more , " his wife said in a tired voice . " I do n't want to play any more with all this rich man 's junk . I hate quinine tonic and I hate jodhpurs and hoots and I hate open foreign cars and I hate Heinitz and I feel sorry for that poor damn Indian who got hit with a wrench . " Her husband said , reaching down and chucking her under the chin , " We 've got to carry on , old girl , - and then when he got no response but a sob he grabbed the wheel and said in his own voice , " Jesus , I guess we have to go through with it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrench had fallen down into the bottom of the arroyo . There was a dead , black and white fcist dog at the bottom of the arroyo and the body of the Indian rolled until it almost touched the dead feist dog . The side of the arroyo was too steep for them to get to the Indian with succor , so they fixed the bridge and watched while three Indians came down the arroyo with one other Indian leading a spare mount . They watched while the Indians hung the body on the spare mount and one of the Indians who had not helped with the loading held the body on , leading both horses , as they went up the far bank and toward the log trading post they could all see in the distance . The Indians did not look at them once . F ELIX MOUNT ROYAL , Lord Rundle , and Rabbit Stockings had discovered the body , and with the help of Tom-Dick-and-Harry , who was out chasing sheep with a spare mount , they lugged the body up to the post of the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of sheep hides and brilliant with the blankets of their wives . The trader put some white man 's medicine on the head of Coyotes-Love-Me and the Indian ? opened his soft dark eyes on the blankets that hung down too bright and turned his head until his soft eyes lighted on the hides that stank . " Why realty , he will be fine , he is better . Why really , everything will be all right . " The Indians did not believe or disbelieve this that they told the trader but the  --  wanted him to feel good about his religion , about his magic . The Indians always allowed the trader to try his magic first because after all these years they had grown to respect him and this was one of the ways they showed their appreciation . Sometimes it even did some good and they did not have to have a sing , did not have to use their own religion . But for Coyotes-Love-Me they all knew that tonight they would have a chant . It was a terrible wallop . The white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's blow ; it would take serious medicine . The white trader 's name was George Bowman and he knew the Indians were being polite . He knew they thought it would take serious medicine not only for the head of Coyotes-Love-Me but against the spirit of the man who had done it . T 11E white trader motioned them all into the front room and sat down on a small Victorian stool covered with perfect velvet . There was something regal about it , sitting there surrounded by all the turquoise and silver jewelry The People had pawned , against the flour and tobacco you could not see . It had an effect . " Why really , " the white trader began in their own language . " Why really , the jails of Gallup arc full of The People who war on the white man . I have some medicine to use against this man , this manand his spirit , if you will permit me . " " Why really , no , " Lord Rundle said quickly , raising his fiery jeweled hand to a brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red cotton band across his forehead . He was dressed in the Levis and boots of the others . Some velvet-clad squaws came in watch the talk and sat on the floor Pepsi and Royal Crown Colas . " Why really , no , " Lord Rundle repeated . " With this man we deal in our own custom . " There was a silence with the trader saying nothing , tipping a silver and turquoise pawn in front of him . " Oh but really , it is true , " Felix Mount Royal said . " The Gallup jails are full of us . " Felix Mount Royal 's squaw congratulated him with her eyes and switched her cold bottle of Royal Crown Cola to her other hand . " Why really , maybe I will listen to your plans , Sansi , ' ' Lord Rundle said . " Ha-ko-shee . Thank you , " the white trader said . " My plan is to make him lose face . That is complicated to explain but excellent for permanent cure if I have luck . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the squaws banged their Pepsi and Royal Crown Colas on the floor in agreement and approval and to make a noise which they liked too . Tom-Dick-and-Harry , a short , white-appearing Indian with bandy legs and a clean scar under his right eye , came in now from the back room and gave them permission to put the hurt Coyotes-Love-Me in his hogan , as was his custom . It was not only that Tom-Dick-and-Harry was not convinced of the truth of the Navaho belief that the bad spirits would return to haunt a hogan in which one of The People died : it was also that he was certain that he had all the bad luck there was in this world right now and that no spirit could add much more to what was coming his way in the future . Lord Acton , **28;1348;TOOLONG , Felix Mount Royal , and the Marquis of Steyne carried out the body of CoyotesLove-Me with Tom-Dick-and-Harry leading the way and Rabbit Stockings bringing up the rear carrying a large economy-sized box of cornflakes and a pint of Sloan 's liniment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The squaws are not moved easily to excitement  --  which is probably good , the trader felt , because they carry the entire wealth of The People around their necks and waists in the form of coral , silver , and turquoise jewelry of expensive and good taste , and it costs nothing to giggle , but with excitement you never know . They would pawn the jewelry with the trader when the winter was . deep and win it back when they sold the sheep . The jewelry was shown off well against billowing bright skirts of calico and velvet , cut in the manner of the American Army officers ' wives at the stockade of Fort Sumner where all The People were imprisoned from 1864 to 1868 . T HE white trader put the velvet stool away on its shelf back of the counter where his father had kept it and put the piece of jewelry back in the case , beneath the books of his father , Ivanhoe , Burke 's Peerage , The Lady of the Lake , and others his father had used to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long for the ledger , like **28;1378;TOOLONG - in - the - Stomach - by - a - Deer - on - **30;1408;TOOLONG . The trader had of course inherited the post from his father , who was killed in the Low Countries in the war of 1914-18 . Along with the post had come the responsibilities of the Indians , the jewelry , the wool , and the velvet stool . The Indians trusted and respected the trader , even to the myth they had built up that his father as a boy had been stolen by the Utes from The People and finally had escaped back to them . The trader let it go at that but he spoke the language and knew the customs . A mission had made a short and dull stand in the vicinity before it disappeared , to have immortality only in a sign which read : " Tradition is the Enemy of Progress . " When the sign was completed the missionary had asked the trader to come and have a look , and the trader had said that if the missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless the trader was sorry when the mission folded . They had brought food and clothing in the winter . And if they were rude enough to insist their religion was superior to The People 's religion , they knew not what they did . But the trader was concerned now about the invasion of the Moving People . Maybe this too was some form of Progress . The trader was not a romantic who was opposed to the word , hut , although he believed it was inevitable , he did not believe it could not be selective . Although great parts of Progress were certain , this would never be : the destruction of the rye and the winter wheat , the busting of The People on the head with wrenches . The trader had decided to make his stand here at the store . Later he might use The People , but first he would meet the leader of the Moving People here alone . T HE trader had been tipped off to the invasion by an engineer from Albuquerque who had come up to check on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the checkerboard area . The white trader had told him to lay off because the Indians had most of the flat areas planted to rye and winter wheat and it would be impossible to stay off it . The engineer said it was his duty to report possible scenic rally points to the club and if Kurt Heinitz decided on this area there was nothing he could do , or anyone else for that matter . And if the trader and the population were going to be difficult and the terrain impossible , well that was what Heinitz was looking for  --  enjoyed . The engineer would get a brush on the back from Heinitz instead of a slap on the car and Heinitz did not give his favors lightly or often . He told the trader the date . The trader had then gone into the vast back room to direct the sorting of the hides and think . When he had thought of something acceptable he wrote a message out on his father 's desk and gave it to the sorter of the hides , Lord Acton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Ventana . Then he had drained the gasoline from his own Sears gravity feed tank on stilts into his tractor and given the last remaining two gallons to the medicine man , Paracelsus , to use for bright fires . He had then busied the remaining interval of time until today with the organization of treating the Indians ' sheep against blue-tongue . As he looked out the window now he saw the advance scouting pink and yellow MGs pull up . They circled the post three times , each time in a smaller circle until they finally stopped . One of the women got out and walked toward the post and the others remained behind to contact the main force over the radio . The woman in chartreuse with the huge chartreuse alligator bag walked up to thc post and looked in the window ; then she went to the door and opened it and looked in to see if what she had seen through the window was true . Then she closed the door and hollered to the others . " My God ! The boy in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " T , HE others looked up from their sending equipment in surprise as she opened the door again and went in . She entered a room lined with silver and turquoise and food under a ceiling draped with saddles and boots , lanterns and harness , so that she had to move among them carefully until she reached the counter laden with pawns . She pretended an interest in this but all the while she was staring at the trader who was writing something , and working her way up the counter toward him , and now she was at the elbow of his heavy leather jacket . " I do n't like to be rude , but did anyone ever tell you you looked exactly like Ghengis Khan ? " The trader put down his pen and looked at her carefully . " No , Ma'am , they never did . " " No but seriously , T do n't say these things , " she said . " You do look exactly like Genghis Khan . " Helen Hooyar came in now and the lady in chartreuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Genghis Khan ? " Helen Hooyar was fiddling with the edge of one of the blankets and staring out at them between two saddles that hung down . " By God , I think he looks noble , " Helen Hooyar said . " I never met Genghis Khan but if he looks noble then he looks like Genghis Khan . He 's a teal man , not one of these city creeps . Living out here alone develops the soul , and something else too . I bet I could write poetry if I lived out here . " Lonesome Johnson and Mr. Van Ester came in now and Lonesome Johnson noticed the squaws lined along the counter on the floor sipping their drinks with the decorum of any DAR chapter . " Pepsi and Royal Crown Cola , " Lonesome Johnson said . " The Coca-Cola people have readied a climax market with the small bottle . They 'll never make vast inroads into the consumer dollar of the lower-income groups until they come out with the twelve-ounce unit . The general public does n't know it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to happen . On a more competitive market all the larger firms I am associated with are taking a heightened interest in the lower-income dollar . In this case , ten cents , " Lonesome Johnson said , dropping his voice , realizing everyone was ignoring him . But in his business Lonesome Johnson was used to being ignored which was offset somewhat by the large corporations he had the pleasure of being associated with . Lonesome Johnson wandered down the shelves now until he found a certain brand of soap . Putting this on his shoulder he walked up to the trader . 4 6 . OES this do anything to you ? " he said . D " Strike any bell at all ? No ? Twelve o'clock every night , Channel 4 , I merchandise this product . Still , way out here you 're out of touch , kind of , with reality . You probably do n't even have a TV set . " " No , " the trader said . " I certainly could use a character like you just to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You would n't consider it ? " Lonesome Johnson said . " No , " the trader said . " You know , you 're right , " Lonesome Johnson said and turned to the others . " No , but he 's right . By God , I wish I could live out here myself . The air ! Notice the air , " Lonesome Johnson said , taking a deep breath of sheep hides . " By God , this country makes a man of you . I might chuck everything some day and come out here and start again . I could paint pictures . " Skeets Van Ester was looking through the window out at the . SOOn she would wander around to have a look at the latest thing in hogans . " It 's spectacular , " Skeets Van Ester said , still staring through the window . " It 's like something- out of Cecil B. De Mille . It makes you feel close to God . Imagine what a man like Kurt Heinitz could do with a place like this . Why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . All these beautiful possibilities wasting away waiting for a man like Kurt Heinitz . " " Everybody outside . " Kurt Heinitz was standing just inside the door waiting for them to file out . They filed out . Kurt Heinitz closed the door gently and walked quickly toward the trader , pausing to examine a piece of jewelry on the way . " You have fine workmen , " he said , putting the concha belt down . The trader did n't say anything . " I 've also come to apologize for that accident to one of your men . " The trader still did n't say anything but he took the concha belt and put it under the counter before he went back to his figures . " We want to be correct , " Kurt Heinitz said . " We are not a mob . We are very well organized and I am the leader . We want to be correct if you will simply tell me what .

" Perhaps we can make a deal , ' ' Heinitz said quietly , picking up the edge of a blanket , " No deal . No gasoline , " the trader said . " But I told them , " Heinitz said , his voice loosening , dropping the edge of the blanket . " 1 told them when there was no gas in La Ventana that they need not go on to Cuba and waste their time . I told them there was gas here . I had it on good authority . If we had to walk out of here they would think me a fool . " The trader dropped his pen and looked at Kurt Heinitz for the first time . " We will see what we can do to get you out of here . I gave the medicine man two gallons of fuel for bright magic . Maybe you can talk him out of it . It will take you to Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Good , " Heinitz said , confidently . " I 'm kind of a medicine man myself . Have you ever seen my rockets over Alamogordo ?

" " There is an interpreter outside the door . It has been arranged . " - Thank you very much , " Heinitz said , turning . " You have nothing to thank me for , " the trader said . " You Americans are all alike , " Heinitz said , going out the door and smiling . " All alike . " T HE trader appeared to go back to the figures in the sheep ledger with his pen but actually he wrote across all the vertical lines on the ledger page in a clear hand and then he drew a line and wrote something else . Now he tapped the pen against his nose in thought before he reached down and crossed part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . The odd cars of the Moving People looked strange against the hogans . Tom-Dick-and-Harry was outside . He was a mission Indian and he spoke a little of everything . Tom-Dick-and-Harry was kind of a mess . He did n't fit in with the whites and now he did n't fit in with The People . Tom-Dickand-Harry did n't believe anything any more . But he would he a good interpreter . The medicine man that the trader 's father had named Paracelsus was dressed like the other Indians except that the quality of the clothes was better , his hogan was bigger , and his horses were fatter  --  just like most doctors on the outside except that here the payoff was in sheep  --  but he had knives and herbs and such that go with the business . And besides all this , the medicine man had sings , he was part of the religion , he treated the whole person . He had a lot of luck . Was Heinitz going to get the gas ? " Why really , of course , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few things he must do for a cure . Heinitz was desperate and willing and he tried to make some sand painting while the medicine man corrected him and the Moving People laughed . Now the medicine man explained the whole thing very carefully to Heinitz through Tom-Dick-andHarry in one-syllable words . But Heinitz was still all thumbs and his Moving People laughed . He jumped on hot rocks while the Moving People laughed and he made signs to the sun while the Moving People laughed again , But nobody laughed at the next medicine . Heinitz did n't have to do anything , The People took care of everything , and nobody laughed . No one laughed at all . T HE trader was busy putting up saddles when Rabbit Stockings came in and got some matches . The trader had some bad thoughts about it at first but then consoled himself with the guess that they were probably for Lady Blessington 's pipe . She smoked a home-made mixture put together by Paracelsus which was marvelous except that it was noncombustible . Sometimes it took two boxes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had smoked a pipe long before cancer became a fad , but she smoked it for her health and , not counting TB and a few other things she had in her own right , it seemed to work . The trader smelled gasoline . He could he wrong but the wind was right and he thought he smelled gasoline . The trader put down the saddle . 46 o MORE medicine , " the trader said , ' cutting the ropes . " Why really , " the medicine man said , " I was right in the middle of an operation . " " You certainly were , " the trader said , taking the rope from around Heinitz ' shoulders . Heinitz ' face was perfectly white . " Why really , he is not cured , " the medicine man said . " I promise you he is cured , " the trader said . " Thank you , Sansi , " Paracelsus said . " 1 do the best I can with the little I have . " " Is there any gas left ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . " We had to use it all in the medicine , Sansi . But you did n't think we were going to burn him ? " " It was just a scare , " the trader said . " That 's right , Sansi . Just a scare . " " Well , you scared me , " the trader said . " Sometime it is necessary to treat everyone , " Paracelsus said . " Evil is that kind of sickness . " But this was only the beginning of the sing . As the strangers sweated to gel their cars back across the arroyo , as the trader said they must , they could hear the thin , high wail of an alone singer re-echoing back off the dark mountains . Now the singer was joined by all of The People and it became a deep low-cadenced chant like a part of the wind noise coming through the mountains , part of the bright-banded cliffs and the mushroomed mesas , the big flat lands and the arroyos enormous with nothing . Perhaps , too , tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things that must always be forgotten  --  the Navaho Nation was once the greatest of all the Moving People .
