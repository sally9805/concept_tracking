The back lawn of a country house about an hour and a half by train from New York . It is a late mid-September afternoon in some year of the not-remote future . One corner of the house is visible at the extreme left of the stage , revealing it as one of those monumental but clumsily-planned piles that were popular in America in the eighties . A porch runs around both sides , heavily screened by vines , with a short flight of steps that leads down to the lawn from the side that faces the audience , in such a way that it is seen sideways from the front of the stage . Above the porch , on the second floor , on the side that fills the left side of the stage , is a bow-window that swells out in a lump from the yellow wooden surface of the house . At the right of the stage , a wall , too high for passersby to see over , against which China roses are blooming , shuts the garden in from the street . High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the middle of the lawn are four chairs and a little round table , all made of forged iron and painted white : two of the chairs are the upright kind and the others low lounging-chairs with wheels on the back legs . They are arranged around the table , the upright chairs facing the audience and the other two drawn up on either side . A gardener , old and stooping and with longish hair , is standing , with his back to the audience , trimming a rambler vine on the side of the porch that faces it . A woman comes out from the porch and starts down the steps but stops half-way . She is a handsome brunette , in her early thirties , but got up in such a way as not to bring out her feminine attractiveness . She wears a kind of brown business suit with a buttoned jacket , and her hair , parted straight in the middle , has been tightly stretched back and done up in a bun . She is tense , with an habitual tensity that never completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be beautiful when they bloomed the second time , those roses . The rose bugs messed them up in the summer , and I 'd been hoping they 'd be perfect this fall  --  but they 're obviously going to pieces without ever having amounted to anything . They 're stunted ! I do n't want to go near them Nothing I have is ever right ! Why ca n't I have flowers like other people ? p. 3 THE GARDENER ( presenting himself readily and speaking eagerly , a little overacting his part ) . Dey 're not in de fulla bloom , signora . JUDITH ( looking around ) . Are n't they ? THE GARDENER ( coming forward ) . You wait  --  you will see : in a day or two , they will be molto belle , bellissime !  --  Come and look . ( She comes down the steps and follows him over to the rose-bushes . ) See : de leetla mossa rose , she just begin to open wide . JUDITH You 're sure they 're really going to pan out ? THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letta me showa you de Golden Dawn . JUDITH That name is so mushy ! THE GARDENER ( exhibiting a rose ) . Eccola , graziosa signora : just lika de morning sky before de sun showa himself : all yellow wit ' just a pale pinka flush . JUDITH ( looking at another blossom above it ) . There 's something the matter with this one . THE GARDENER ( nipping it off with his shears ) . You know what maka dat , signora ? A leetla spider  --  so small you can hardly see him . He eata up all de juice of de rose , and by-and-by she turna brown . p. 4 JUDITH ( as if to herself ) . I do n't like to hear about things like that .  --  I knew there was something wrong . ( She looks at the roses with distaste and apprehension . ) THE GARDENER Dat 's de only one dat hava dat .  --  You wanta me to picka you some ? JUDITH It 's not too soon ? Suppose they just die when I get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be afraid , signora . ( He begins clipping them off . ) For dem it is right now de besta moment . ( Showing her one ) Ecco . It is for de roses just lika for de udder tings : if you tasta de besta moment , it lasta you all de life  --  if you do n't tasta , de moment never come ! JUDITH I have to have things absolutely perfect  --  otherwise I ca n't enjoy them . THE GARDENER Corpo di Bacco , signora ! Nutting in all de world is absolutely perfect by itself . We must not expecta God to give us de perfect tings ready made to enjoy , to admire , to love . We must maka de life perfect by bringing to it de love and de art . JUDITH But if they 've got spiders in them , they 'll just turn brown and horrible , anyway . p. 5 THE GARDENER ( holding up a flower ) . Look here : dissa rose is notta perfect  --  but if you wear it lika dis ( holding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will maka de perfect rose . ( He offers it to her . ) JUDITH ( refusing to take it ) . No , I do n't want it : it 's blemished . THE GARDENER Ah , porco Iddio , signora ! to maka de beauty from de tings date are damaged , dat is de greatest triumph for de man . JUDITH ( taking the roses from him ) . I 'll just take the good ones  --  thank you .  --  You might paint the chairs and things now that we do n't use them so much . They look terrible . And I must get some cushions for the big ones ! They 're not comfortable a bit like that . They 've been making me absolutely miserable ! THE GARDENER Ah , signora , it 's not de cushions dat cura de misery  --  it 's de happiness dat maka de comfort . JUDITH You ought to write those moralizings down . THE GARDENER Grazie , signora . JUDITH They might n't sound so sententious on paper . p. 6 THE GARDENER Scusi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman appears . He is a man in his early forties , pasty and partly bald , dressed dandiacally but in rather bad taste . He wears a light gray suit , with spats , a dark green Homburg hat , a violet tie on a lighter purple shirt and a handkerchief to match sticking out of his breast-pocket . He carries a light cane . GANDERSHEIM ( taking off his hat ) . Please pardon me for coming in like this . Is this Mrs. Brock ? JUDITH Yes . GANDERSHEIM Well , I 'm the person you 're renting this house from . JUDITH The agent ? GANDERSHEIM No : the owner . JUDITH M. S. Ferguson ? GANDERSHEIM Yes . ( Shaking hands with self-conscious urbanity ) It 's nice to meet you at last . The Gardener , who has watched his entrance , now turns to go back to his work and as he does so faces the audience . THE GARDENER ( winking at the audience and dropping his Italian accent ) . Just a few old platitudes ! He returns to trimming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 GANDERSHEIM ( going on to Judith ) . I hope you do n't mind my appearing by the back way like this . It 's so natural for me and it 's shorter from the station . JUDITH I thought you were in Europe . GANDERSHEIM I was , but I suddenly found I could n't stick it and I hopped a plane and came back . JUDITH Wo n't you sit down ? I 'm afraid that these chairs are inexcusably uncomfortable  --  they 're supposed to have cushions . GANDERSHEIM ( sitting down in the upright chair at the left and putting his hat on the table ) . They 're delightful ! How well you 've kept things up ! JUDITH ( sitting down in the other straight chair ) . I 've had the garden attended to . It was in very bad shape when we came . GANDERSHEIM Really ? JUDITH Yes : absolutely a jungle . Your caretaker had n't done anything about it  --  so we got a regular gardener . GANDERSHEIM Oh , dear : really ? Did he neglect the pigeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came by the stable . JUDITH They had some kind of disease , and most of them died . p. 8 GANDERSHEIM How heartbreaking ! I wanted to keep them . They were a part of the old stable and made it still seem alive . I hope you have n't minded my insisting that it should n't be used as a garage . JUDITH We did what you suggested : we rented the garage across the road . GANDERSHEIM I was sure they 'd let you have it  --  that place has been empty , too .  --  You do n't keep horses ? JUDITH No ; but we 've had the stable repainted . GANDERSHEIM Just a shade too bright , perhaps . JUDITH We tried to get the same color . In a year or so it wo n't look so glaring . GANDERSHEIM It had a quality , I always thought . You have n't cleaned out the stalls ? ( Smiling with a shade of deprecation ) I liked to have some oats in the mangers . JUDITH We have n't touched it , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm finding fault . Everything that I 've seen looks splendidly . One never knows what to expect of one 's tenants , and I 'd never even met you , you know . JUDITH So you came out to check . GANDERSHEIM I just wanted to meet you and see the place and find out how you were getting along . p. 9 JUDITH My husband 's reading proofs . In a few minutes . I 'll let him know you 're here . GANDERSHEIM Do n't disturb him ! I just dropped in . JUDITH Do tell me about Europe . Is the situation really worse ? GANDERSHEIM Not exactly worse , perhaps , but you get to feel it more if you stay there a long time . JUDITH There 's still not much food or coal ? GANDERSHEIM Oh , there 's plenty of food in the good hotels , and they manage to heat them more or less . It 's the atmosphere  --  the whole state of mind . JUDITH Pretty tense ? GANDERSHEIM Not only tense but inhuman , in a very disconcerting way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were becoming dehumanized  --  with all the offices and factories and subways  --  but now in Europe , in a different way , they 're losing their individuality . You remember how they used always to be fighting for their various national cultures ? The Frenchman wanted to be a Frenchman ; the Czech wanted to be a Czech ; the inhabitants of every little province wanted to keep their own traditions , if it merely meant putting on some old peasant dress and celebrating a local feastday . Well , the only thing they struggle for now is to perpetuate some system of slavery that is going to make them all alike . One feels that they 're just clustering like iron filings on these big concentrations of power . p. 10 JUDITH In the countries we dominate , too ? GANDERSHEIM ( smiling ironically ) . In the countries the United States dominates , we 've gotten ourselves into the position of backing reactionary movements that are using all the methods of fascism . I 'm a conservative , but the kind of thing we 're doing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reds , but we do n't realize that their enemies are just as undesirable as they are . We 've never understood Europe  --  at least our worthy presidents never do  --  and the result is that we 're now being swept along by the hideous subhuman power that 's wreaking havoc all over the world . JUDITH What power do you mean ? GANDERSHEIM ( as if his answer were more or less self-evident and revealing a touch of madness which makes Judith look around at him ) . Why , the demiurge that 's running amuck , devouring civilization . JUDITH Do you identify him with anything in particular ? GANDERSHEIM I identify him with almost everything ! JUDITH Oh . ( After a moment 's pause ) Has your demiurge got a name ? GANDERSHEIM He 's got a thousand names  --  you 've heard them : Belial , Moloch , Kali  --  call him Nobodaddy , like Blake  --  call it the Second Coming , like Yeats , with a wild beast instead of a savior  --  call him Shidnats Slyme , the Monster God . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GANDERSHEIM Well , not precisely an addict  --  though I know his work pretty well . JUDITH If you can read him at all , you 're an addict . I 'm one of the people that ca n't read him , but my husband is crazy about him . GANDERSHEIM I suppose I must make a confession so that we sha n't go on talking on a false assumption . I am Gandersheim . JUDITH You 're not really ? I knew it was a pseudonym , but you 're not like the descriptions of him . GANDERSHEIM ( grinning slyly ) . That 's just our publicity  --  a mystification ! JUDITH The photographs are hoaxes , too ? GANDERSHEIM A friend of mine posed for them all . JUDITH ( looking over to study him ) . But I see that you are like him in some ways . Are those the violet eyes that sometimes fade to the invisible color of ultra-violet rays ? GANDERSHEIM ( rather pleased ) . Perhaps . JUDITH And you 're wearing a violet tie . GANDERSHEIM There are certain points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . p. 12 JUDITH But where 's the Brazilian butterfly that you 're supposed to wear in your buttonhole ? and the mystic rings of priceless old jade ? He holds out his left hand , on one finger of which is a large jade ring . GANDERSHEIM And I do happen to know something about butterflies . JUDITH Is it true that you drink nothing but Armagnac from the cellar of the Comte de Germain ? Frank Brock comes down the steps from the porch . He is a loose rangy man of forty-three , dressed in a business suit of something less than the best urban cut and with shaggy undisciplined hair . He wears spectacles with dark rims and a wide razzle-dazzle tie . He is carrying the afternoon paper . GANDERSHEIM That 's mythical , I 'm afraid  --  but I have had some rather choice Armagnac . It has a flavor of violets , you see  --  violet and beyond , again . JUDITH Here 's my husband . Gandersheim gets up . JUDITH ( to Frank ) . Who do you think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he looks at Gandersheim ) . I have n't the slightest idea . ( He has a thickly Middle-Western voice and an emphatic Middle-Western way of talking. ) p. 13 JUDITH Gansvoort von Gandersheim . FRANK ( after a moment of sizing up Gandersheim and deciding it is not a joke ) . No ! ( Coming over and shaking hands ) Say , I 'm a fan of yours ! JUDITH Frank used to subscribe to Gruesome Tales just to read the Shidnats Slyme stories . FRANK And now the goddam Metropolitan  --  which is otherwise a lousy magazine ! GANDERSHEIM I 'm also , under my other name , the person that you 're renting this house from . FRANK The hell you are ! GANDERSHEIM I just dropped in to see how you were getting on . FRANK Sit down ! ( He throws himself into the lounging-chair on the left , as Gandersheim resumes his seat . ) Well , for goodness ' sake !  --  and I never knew about it ! GANDERSHEIM ( pleased ) . I always use my real family name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , tell me : what happened to that chemistry professor when he finally got hold of the formula so that he could summon up Shidnats at will ? Was he so scared by what happened the first time that he never tried it again , or did he turn all the demons loose on that academic cabal that was trying to block his promotion ? p. 14 GANDERSHEIM Ah , that story has n't been written , and I 'm not sure that I can give you an answer . FRANK I do n't want to ask indiscreet questions  --   --  GANDERSHEIM ( smiling ) . Oh , it is n't a question of that . My contract with Metropolitan 's running out , and I 'm not sure they want any more stories  --  so I really have n't thought about what happened next . FRANK I do n't know how I can bear it if you do n't go on . I want to know whether the Shidnats adepts were able to utilize his power without blowing out their fuses . GANDERSHEIM It is rather risky , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JUDITH Mr. Gandersheim thinks that his demiurge is the dominating influence in Europe . FRANK I should n't wonder if you were right at that . GANDERSHEIM You know there have been some rather odd coincidences between certain incidents in the stories and some of the things that have been happening lately . FRANK What 's an example ? GANDERSHEIM Did you happen to see one of my tales called The Octagon Building Conspiracy ? p. 15 FRANK ( nodding ) . About the Shidnats cult in the war . GANDERSHEIM That came out before the spy revelations . FRANK Yes , by God , it did ! GANDERSHEIM I sometimes have a queer kind of insight . It came to me almost like a vision . I had no private information , but one day I conceived the idea of young scientists and government officials  --  absolutely the conscientious type , the kind of people one would never suspect  --  falling under some sinister influence and betraying their country to a foreign power . It was incredible , and yet it happened . And my stories usually pass for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting , it 's actually easier to swallow your goblins than a lot of the real stuff that 's going on . That 's the reason you go over the way you do : you feed people horror in homeopathic doses so that they 're able to face the things that are happening , and that they ca n't seem to do anything about or even begin to grasp . Your shudder stories deal more or less with the same elements of murder and espionage , but the reader can get through one in three-quarters of an hour and everything is perfectly logical , and the wind-up gives him some sort of satisfaction . GANDERSHEIM It 's gratifying to hear you say that . I 've always felt my work was modern . p. 16 JUDITH With a good allowance of old-fashioned Gothic . GANDERSHEIM Alas , for the Gothic ! It 's done for , I 'm afraid . One misses it in post-war Europe . There are more ruins , of course , than ever , and one ca n't say they are n't sometimes grisly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Germany today is a limbo , full of beings that have never been really born  --  they 're such gibbering specters themselves that they make the Wild Huntsmen and the Lenore bridegrooms seem as solid in retrospect as the old beer and pumpernickel . JUDITH But Italy 's still romantic ? GANDERSHEIM The landscape but not the life . There 's plenty of crime , to be sure  --  sometimes ferocious enough  --  but it 's mostly quite wholesale and sordid : just a routine slaughter of hostages . Nothing could be more remote from the magnificent outrages of the Borgias and the gamier days of the Papacy . In England , the big country houses that have always been so marvelously haunted have been confiscated by the wretched Labourites and turned into administrative centers . Last summer I went to Glen Murtagh Castle , the Earl of Medard 's place  --  which I 've always wanted to see : it 's supposed to have had a Man in Armor , a charming Woman in White and a recurrent hereditary monster  --  and what did I find but a rationing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was told by a horrid little clerk  --  obviously lower middle class  --  that it had been sent by the Earl to the United States to get it away from the Blitz and that " we "  --  meaning the Labour people  --  had decided not to bring it back . p. 17 JUDITH How pathetic to be robbed of one 's monsters ! GANDERSHEIM Oh , there are monsters enough  --  and the new thing , of course , has its own kind of beauty . There is a real thrill in destruction  --  and destruction has never been achieved on such a gigantic scale and so completely without inhibitions . The godlike irresponsibility of it !  --  you 're sitting up there in the clouds and ( illustrating by snapping his fingers ) you just go click , click , click ! and you pulverize whole cities  --  men and women and children are crushed or roasted to death , and palaces and public buildings  --  the big shells that they put up for show , the pedestals to make themselves important  --  they 're all flapped away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's hov and the shop that sells fish and chips  --  while the bomber sails along overhead as nonchalant and unremorseful as if he 'd just lit up an autumn bonfire . And ( smiling ) there were some wonderful touches !  --  the tigers and snakes and apes that were let loose when the zoos were bombed and went wandering about the streets ! ( Judith gives him a sharp look . ) But when one comes to it a few years later , the results do seem rather bleak . A house that 's been shattered by bombing shows nothing but naked plaster  --  the rooms do n't preserve their bad memories as a rugged old castle can do  --  unless , of course , it happens to be a room where people have been shot against the wall or a torture chamber stained with blood . But even with a place of that sort it would take at least fifty years to make it glamorous with a patina of legend , and in the meantime it may be rebuilt  --  or destroyed by another bombing . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GANDERSHEIM It 's quite creepy enough in other ways . I was quite unnerved when I left . One day I started talking to a man on the train  --  I could n't make out his nationality : he spoke English with some sort of accent  --  and he turned out to have read my books . I thought he knew them a little too well  --  as if he might just have got the subject up . It occurred to me that he might be a spy  --   --  FRANK Why would anybody want to spy on you ? GANDERSHEIM I 'd been telling people how I felt about what was going on in Europe ; and it made me a little nervous when it turned out we were stopping at the same hotel  --  so , instead of getting off at Genoa , I went right on through to Florence , and there , lo and behold ! in my pension I found myself sitting at table with another mysterious creature  --  a woman with an obvious wig  --  who talked to me about my writings  --   --  FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . It 's what I tell you : a lot of people have read you because they 've got the same jitters you have . GANDERSHEIM Well , in any case , Europe was getting me down  --  I had a night of abject panic , and then I jumped on a plane for home . And very happy I am to be back , I can tell you ! p. 19 FRANK How long have you been away ? GANDERSHEIM I went over the second spring after the end of the war . FRANK Well , I hate to hand you a wet blanket the moment you get off the boat , but you do n't want to have any illusions about the kind of U.S.A. you 've come back to ! GANDERSHEIM You sound frightening . What do you mean ? It 's true I 'm rather out of touch . FRANK Do n't imagine that we have n't got plenty of spies ! GANDERSHEIM Hardly on the same scale , surely ! FRANK I do n't know : it seems to me nowadays that every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  GANDERSHEIM But what is it they 're agents of ? FRANK Why , of all these damn pressure groups !  --  the same thing you have in Europe , only not operating quite so openly . GANDERSHEIM How disquieting ! FRANK It 's gotten to the point where I can hardly get my magazine out . I 'm constantly pursued and persecuted by the lobbyists of all these groups , these various political and religious organizations , and more than half the time they 're under cover . p. 20 GANDERSHEIM I did n't realize that Spotlight dealt with controversial subjects . FRANK Hell , fifteen years ago it would n't have been called controversial , but today , good . God ! it takes all a man 's strength to stand up for an independent factual article that does n't even try to draw conclusions ! GANDERSHEIM But how can that be ? FRANK It can be because what used to be everybody 's privilege , that Americans took for granted  --  free press and free speech  --  has now gotten to be nothing short of a heroic individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order , is n't it ? FRANK It 's still in the Constitution , but everybody wants to ignore it . GANDERSHEIM The radicals and the reactionaries , you mean ? FRANK That line-up is obsolete now . GANDERSHEIM I do wish you 'd fill me in . I 'm quite ignorant about what 's been happening . I could n't make anything of the political news when I read it in the Paris Herald . FRANK It certainly is n't the politics you knew , if you left as long ago as that , and you may have some pretty severe shocks in store for you . The most important fact of the last ten years  --  that you 'll have to begin by grasping  --  is the virtual disappearance of the old two-party system . What happened first of all was that , beginning with the New Deal , the Democrats swallowed everything ; but by that time the Democratic Party was a collection of special interests that were competing with one another like hell  --  so that it got to be simply a question of which kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally came down to was a scrimmage between a whole lot of organized groups , each trying to get control of the government and resorting to every kind of skulduggery  --  bribery , blackmail , violence  --  to get themselves into office . p. 21 GANDERSHEIM But what are they ?  --  the Reds , I suppose  --  but what other groups have we here ? FRANK Well , I 'll give you the political picture  --  reading from Right to Left . First of all , you have the Reds  --  they 're the extreme Right : they want to institute state slavery , abolish civil rights altogether and have the country run by an oligarchy . Then you have the New Federalists  --  they want to restrict the vote to big employers of labor and incomes in the upper brackets . Next come the Constitutionalists , who are the nearest thing we 've got to a Left : they want to keep the Constitution . All of these have political programs  --  they 're the only big groups that do . But that does n't tell the whole story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without programs but work for their group interests . The strongest one now is Labor . The politicos try to exploit it , but usually it exploits them . Then there are the Children of Peter , with their religious organization behind them . Actually the objectives of the Peters are just about the same as the Reds ' , and their methods are about the same . The only difference is that the Peters are directed from Madrid instead of from Belgrade , and that they make use of father confessors instead of third-degree police . But both the Reds and the Children of Peter want to put the brakes on education and to keep the working class down . They both organize their own unions as an obstruction to the legitimate unions that are fighting for the interests of Labor . Last and most disgusting perhaps is the new group of Yankee Elitists , our indigenous variety of fascists . They 're mostly just small-time snobs with the usual careerist aspirations , who go along with the Big Business party  --  though , if they think they can gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to turn into Reds overnight . They 've combined with the Southern Dixiecrats , who want to keep the Negro disfranchised in the interests of old-time Southern chivalry . A young man appears from the house and comes over toward the group . p. 22 GANDERSHEIM You appal me : I came back from Europe , really warm about the Statue of Liberty , and you tell me we 're caught in the same trap ! FRANK Well , it 's not quite so bad , even so , as what 's happened to the rest of the world . There are still a few Americans left who do n't want to take dictation from these mass-produced power-units . ( Getting up and raising his voice in his earnestness ) The main stimulus to the founding of the American Republic was disobedience to the King of England , and the mainspring of American vitality has always been our refusal to let anybody tell us what to do . The thing that can save us today is the thing that has made us great . We 've got to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ideas ! GANDERSHEIM Hear , hear ! How splendidly you say it ! It quite rouses my Revolutionary blood ! I date from the Mayflower , you know . ( Judith looks at him , and he adds smiling . ) No , but I really do ! The young man has stopped modestly at Frank 's left , so as not to intrude on the group . He is Frank 's secretary Ellis , an erect clean-cut fellow of twenty-six , a product of the best education , quiet and well-bred but with a perceptible tone of conscious superiority . FRANK ( turning to Ellis ) . Did you get rid of them ? p. 23 ELLIS They 've left , but they 're sure to be back . They insist they 've got to see you personally . FRANK Oh , God ! What 's biting them now ? ( To Gandersheim ) This is just what I was telling you about ! It 's the Reds who have got some squawk . ( To Ellis ) Go ahead and tell me : I want him to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say that our running it puts us in a class with the worst type of Yankee Elitists . FRANK How do they figure that out ? ELLIS Their point is that maraschino cherries are an article of upper-class luxury  --   --  FRANK What 's behind it ? ELLIS What 's evidently behind it is that the pickers belong to a union that 's been fighting the Red infiltration . FRANK So what ? ELLIS That links us with the Elitists . They serve manhattans at the Elitist banquets . FRANK So what ? ELLIS They 'll denounce us as Elitists and ruin our circulation among the small-income groups . FRANK Unless what ? p. 24 ELLIS They 've left us an article setting forth the Red point of view on the crisis in the fruit-pickers ' union  --  and they say they expect us to run it . FRANK ( to Gandersheim ) . There you are ! That 's what I 'm up against ! JUDITH You might introduce Ellis ! FRANK I 'm sorry . ( To Gandersheim ) This is Ellis , my trouble-shooter . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , really ? The visitor gets up and shakes hands , with a slightly Mephistophelean smile in character with his Gandersheim role . JUDITH Mr. Ferguson . GANDERSHEIM Oh , I do n't mind  --  though of course it 's a ridiculous name  --  a mixture of German and Knicker-bocker Dutch . I made it up when I was just a kid , and I signed it to the first story I ever sold . ELLIS I see . JUDITH Do n't you want to sit down , Ellis ? He poises on the left arm of the other lounging-chair . Gandersheim and Frank resume their seats . GANDERSHEIM ( to Frank ) . That first story was written right here , and the name was somehow a product of the atmosphere of this queer old house .  --  I was rather surprised by the way , that an active man of affairs like yourself should have chosen such an old-fashioned place  --  and so far away from New York , in such a deserted neighborhood . p. 25 FRANK It was just exactly the kind of thing I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  out of reach of these goddam propagandists . GANDERSHEIM But you do n't direct your magazine from here ? FRANK I do , by God ! I have an office in town , of course , where they handle the business end , but most of the editorial work is done right here in this house  --  done by us three ! GANDERSHEIM Really ? I 'd imagined something on a bigger scale . During the speeches of Frank that follow , Ellis and Judith , who have evidently heard all this before , talk to one another , smiling , like young people relaxing from their elders . FRANK Hell , you do n't need a big staff if you know exactly what you want and have the self-confidence to make your own decisions . All these ( underlining the words with irony ) editorial conferences and rewrite men and enormous research departments are just ways that editors have to try to make themselves feel important because they have n't got any ideas . They try to find out what the readers ' ideas are  --  they 're always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've worked out the formula for a standardized machine-made product that their readers will always take  --  they sit down and try to figure out how they can appeal to a still lower grade of readers without losing the original lot . The result in the long run is just the same as in radio and television : they 're creating an artificial market for a mechanical mass-culture that depends on reducing the public to a lowest common denominator . You get something just as lifeless and boring as the movies were before they went bankrupt . The old yellow journalism was bad enough , but it at least had a certain vulgar gaudiness , and competition kept it lively . Today you get a processed commodity so completely devoid of flavor or of any emotion or meaning whatsoever that the only way you can force it on the customers is by killing the better grades of goods . p. 26 GANDERSHEIM But Spotlight has not been eliminated ! FRANK American journalism today has gotten to be just like the horsemeat that they put up in cans for dogs !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sealyham has to eat it just the same as the mutt . GANDERSHEIM But you give them something better . FRANK I do  --  and I 've definitely proved that there still exist a whole lot of Americans who are n't satisfied with this goddam kennel food . I go on the opposite theory : I do n't worry about the reader . I assume that any article that interests me  --  on any subject whatever  --  will interest a lot of other people . And I 'm right !  --  by God , I 'm right ! I started out with Spotlight on a shoestring  --  it was practically a little magazine  --  and in four years and a half I 've scared up a circulation of almost three hundred thousand . I 've always maintained , and I 've proved it , that there are still plenty of people in this country who like to read decent writing , who are actually famished for edible print  --  and I believe there are lots of people who do n't want their thinking done for them  --  especially by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! GANDERSHEIM It 's heartening to hear you say so . But what is Spotlight 's own point of view ?  --  simply that of independent critic ? p. 27 FRANK What 's our point of view , Ellis ? ELLIS Liberalism , I suppose . FRANK ( going on to Gandersheim ) . It 's not exactly what you might think of as liberalism , though  --  it 's something older than that . My idea is simply the old-fashioned one that everybody 's got a right to look at the world from the corner he 's sitting in  --  and to yell about anything he does n't like . GANDERSHEIM So you 're always treading on people 's toes ? FRANK So the various pressure publicists are always raising a howl against me  --  and I 'm also beginning to worry the big circulation boys . It 's driving them crazy to realize that there 's somebody who still has the self-assurance to print whatever he pleases and who can actually make it pay . I 've even swiped some of their writers , because I let them sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what I find so annoying with the Metropolitan people : they want to rewrite all my prose . FRANK And what prose they put out , huh ? It 's like some kind of cheap cold cream ! GANDERSHEIM But you never take sides about anything ? FRANK I never plug a political point of view , like the liberals in the twenties did . My contention is that the abuses of the world  --  at least , the majority of them  --  have no more to do with political systems than the big acts of disinterested virtue . They 're just special cases of human weakness . Take these exposs by Percy Gilman . He 's doing the undertakers now . Did you ever realize how the undertakers make a practice of exploiting people 's grief to induce them to buy fancy coffins and all kinds of unnecessary fixings ? p. 28 GANDERSHEIM ( smiling ) . How scandalous ! And that , of course , has no political implications . FRANK It 's not part of an organized system ! It 's simply a petty swindle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been petty swindles since the days of Ananias and Sapphira . JUDITH I do n't agree with Frank about this . The Gardener appears from the porch . THE GARDENER ( to Frank ) . Bertha aska me to tell you de Archbishop want to speak to you on de phone . FRANK ( to Ellis ) . What have we had about the Peters lately ? ELLIS I do n't think we 've had anything for months . FRANK Well , see what he wants , will you ? ( Ellis starts toward the house . ) Tell him I 'm out of town ! FRANK ( to Gandersheim ) . You can be sure he 's got some gripe about something ! THE GARDENER ( to Judith ) . You wanta me to mova de hydrangeas ? JUDITH ( to Gandershmeim ) . I really ought to consult you about this . p. 29 GANDERSHEIM You thought of doing something with the hydrangeas ? JUDITH I 'd thought of moving them back near the stable . Frank looks at the first page of his paper . FRANK Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated attention , presently turning the pages to get at the continuation . ) GANDERSHEIM You do n't like them on the front drive ? JUDITH They 're so badly discolored . If they 're meant to be blue , I 'm afraid they 've degenerated . They 're all sort of greenish and spotty . GANDERSHEIM Oh , you have to put iron in the soil . They used to be very handsome . JUDITH I do n't know what to do about them . GANDERSHEIM But your man here does , I 'm sure . ( To the Gardener ) Sei italiano ? THE GARDENER Parlo italiano , signore . GANDERSHEIM ( to Judith ) . You 're fortunate . They make marvelous gardeners . ( To the Gardener ) Di dove vieni ? Da che paese ? THE GARDENER Da un paese antichissimo , signore. p. 30 GANDERSHEIM Ma da quale ?  --  dimmi . Conosco I'Italia bene . THE GARDENER Non propriamente in Italia . GANDERSHEIM Dove dunque ? THE GARDENER Non lo so pi nemmeno io , signore . GANDERSHEIM ( to Judith ) I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent . He does n't want to tell me where he comes from . JUDITH But about the hydrangeas  --   --  GANDERSHEIM Yes ? JUDITH Would you mind if I moved them back ? GANDERSHEIM Why not try to revive the color ? They 're very much out of fashion , I know , and some people consider them ugly , but I assure you they can be perfectly magnificent . In my mother 's time , they were one of our glories : great rich round fleshy clusters that varied from blue to violet or from pink to a flushed kind of purple  --  and the petals had fine little veins that made them look like  --  like Albrecht Drer 's drawings . JUDITH We could work on them after we 'd moved them . GANDERSHEIM But the approach to the house is quite fine in its way  --  I hope you appreciate it ! Hortensias. umbrella-trees , elephant ears  --  all those ornamental plants of the McKinley period !  --  and the big silver ball in the middle . p. 31 JUDITH We had to put the ball away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stained and tarnished . GANDERSHEIM Well , one ca n't expect everybody to care for such things  --  ( nodding toward the Gardener ) I 'm sure he understands they belong here . ( Addressing him directly ) This place has its style , non vero ? though of course it 's not the Boboli Gardens . THE GARDENER You can see dat somebody here once has tried to make a leettle pattern . GANDERSHEIM Of course there 's a pattern ! My mother designed it , and I do n't like to see it spoiled . ( To Judith ) It 's wonderful the instinct they have about everything connected with aesthetics ! JUDITH ( to the Gardener ) . I 'll let you know later . THE GARDENER Bene , signora . In ogni modo , we could not transplanta dem dis afternoon . For de flowers it is lika for de people . You performa de operation de very first ting in de morning : den de patient have all de day to recover . Judith gives him a long-suffering ironic look . p. 32 GANDERSHEIM ( fruitily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding to the Gardener ) . That 's enough earthy wisdom today . THE GARDENER ( retiring ) . Bene , benissimo . FRANK ( to Judith , holding up the paper ) . Look at this : another goddam political crime ! Cardinal Keenan 's been murdered . She takes the paper from him and quickly glances through the story . GANDERSHEIM Political murders , too ? In the old days , we shot only the presidents ! THE GARDENER ( turning away toward the audience and walking back to the house ) . Il trionfo della morte ! Avanti Savoia ! FRANK ( to Judith ) . That looks like a Red job . ( To Gandersheim ) . The mystery is how they did it . He was burned to death in some way . GANDERSHEIM Where did they find his body ? FRANK He was sitting at his desk in his study . It was almost as if he 'd been electrocuted . GANDERSHEIM It 's strange that electrocution has n't been more used for murders . You can electrocute a person , you know , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an equipment that you can carry in a cigar-box . Were the electrical fixtures examined ? Ellis appears from the house and comes over toward the group . p. 33 FRANK He 'd just been talking on the phone  --  the receiver was still in his hand , but the telephone seemed perfectly normal  --  the insulation was all right . JUDITH What about the burnt-out flashlight ? FRANK That was the other side of the room  --  and electrocution does n't singe the skin . The whole upper part of his body was blackened  --  though his clothes were only burned from the inside . JUDITH But you 've only got the reports of the Peters . They had a chance to set the stage . I 'll bet they did it themselves , just to create a martyr ! FRANK I do n't think they 'd go that far . After all , the Reds in Europe have supplied them with more martyrs than they need . JUDITH They have n't any over here . I would n't put it past them . FRANK It would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slumped . Since the bombings and the concentration camps and the Stalingrad holocaust , nobody but a few old cranks cares a damn about human life . Our emotional thermometer 's blown its top : we do n't react to those things any more . My guess is that for some special reason the Reds wanted to get rid of the Cardinal and counted on its passing as a natural death . ( To Ellis ) What was the call about ? p. 34 ELLIS Just what you 're talking about . FRANK The Archbishop , by God ! I forgot . ELLIS They 've arrested Percy Gilman . FRANK Why ? ELLIS He 's supposed to have been the last person who 'd been in Keenan 's study . FRANK What had Percy gone to see him about ? ELLIS It seems that the Sons of Peter have funeral parlors of their own , and Gilman had gone to the Cardinal to find out whether he knew about their racket . FRANK Well , what , in Heaven 's name , is supposed to have happened ? Is he supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke and fell dead ? ELLIS They accuse him of carbonizing the Cardinal with some kind of canned lightning . JUDITH That flashlight ? ELLIS It does seem suspicious . They ca n't make out how it worked . FRANK They 're just trying to get back at me ! Why would Percy want to kill the Cardinal ? ELLIS They 've dug up that he once lost his job in one of the public schools for saying that Jefferson and Franklin were skeptics about religion . It seems he wrote some articles then against the Peteristic influence on education . p. 35 FRANK That was way back in the forties ! ELLIS They 're making the most of the fact that he once had a nervous breakdown and was sent to a sanitarium . They say he 's a fanatic , a madman . FRANK What did the Archbishop want ? ELLIS He wants you to testify that Gilman was unstable and a religious crank . FRANK The hell I will ! He 's mild as a lamb . JUDITH You have n't known him long . FRANK I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical New Deal hack : conscientious and low-keyed to a fault ! He was sent me by that Teniakis Agency , and they 're always absolutely reliable .  --  And what the hell does the Archbishop mean by telling me what to testify ?  --  What 's their blackmail ? ELLIS They 'll get us suppressed . FRANK Incitement to violence ? ELLIS Yes : they say that we 've always attacked them . FRANK Hell ! did n't we run that article about that big Peter priest who plays basket ball ? THE GARDENER ( to Frank ) . Signore . FRANK ( apprehensively ) . What is it now ? p. 36 THE GARDENER A phone call for you , signore . FRANK Who is it ? THE GARDENER A newspaper reporter . He says he work for de Standard . FRANK Tell him I 've gone out to the West Coast . THE GARDENER Bene , signore . ELLIS Do n't you think it might be worth while to find out what the reporter knows ? JUDITH I 'd talk to him ! The Gardener stops to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Frank begins making a speech , and disappears into the house . FRANK Nowadays they never know anything ! You ca n't find out anything from reading the papers . ( He goes on holding forth to Gandersheim , while Ellis takes the newspaper from Judith and sits down in the lounging-chair to read it . ) The audacious American journalist who dashes to the center of tension and uncovers something that was n't known is just as obsolete today as the cracker-barrel editorial-writer who thinks up his own comments . They both subsist entirely on handouts from the various publicity departments , and the only people who really know what 's happening are the top inner committees of these anti-democratic groups . I 've been a journalist all my life  --  I spent ten years as a city editor  --  but lately I 've had to admit that I have n't got the slightest idea about who 's doing what to whom  --  and there are times when I 'm not sure that I care ! p. 37 JUDITH I hope you 're not going to capitulate this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? Gandersheim , not to seem to pay attention to a conversation that shows signs of acerbity , takes the paper from Ellis , who has laid it on his knee and looked around . JUDITH Well , the Yankee Elitists persuaded you to pretty much retract your statement about F. Bulfinch Boudinot . FRANK I 'm not going to sell Percy out , and I 'm not going to get suppressed . JUDITH What do you propose to do ? ELLIS Had n't I better get in touch with your lawyer ? FRANK More lawyers : my God ! JUDITH They certainly let you down the last time . FRANK Do n't be so defeatist . JUDITH I 'm not defeatist : I think you ought to fight . FRANK Of course I 'm going to fight . I 'm going to take the offensive . I 'm going to find out for myself for once exactly what 's happened and why . JUDITH Who will you get to do it ? You 're not planning to investigate yourself ? FRANK ( ironically ) . That would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about that little man who did the expos of the Trotter poll ? FRANK ( to Gandersheim ) . That 's something you ought to know about ! It turns out that when they take these polls , they do n't actually make a bona fide effort to find out what people think : they 're paid by various interests to manufacture public opinion by producing the right kind of predictions . GANDERSHEIM ( putting down the paper ) . It 's strange that no one heard any noise . There were several other people in the house . One can only imagine something like an enormous oxy-acetylene blow-torch . FRANK ( to Ellis , announcing a sudden idea ) . Do you know who 's going after this story ? ELLIS Have you got an inspiration ? FRANK You are ! ELLIS I 'm afraid I ca n't quite see that . FRANK ( springing to his feet again ) . You 're just the ideal person ! ELLIS But would n't it be better to get somebody who is n't connected with the magazine ? FRANK That does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that nobody will take you seriously . Do n't misunderstand me , but they 'll think you 're a perfect ninny . You 'll be obviously out of your element , and they 'll think you 're nave and diffident  --  those professional foxes and weasels wo n't pay any attention to you . But the fact is  --  you know and I know  --  that you 're a hell of an astute guy . You 're the sharpest checker of copy and the deftest brusher-off of visitors that I 've ever had working for me  --  and what 's more , you have the qualification that your father was an Episcopal minister and that you worked for the Federated Churches  --   --  p. 39 ELLIS I was just Father 's secretary . FRANK But you got to know the leaders in the religious world . ELLIS I do n't exactly like to exploit the connections I made through Father . FRANK He 's dead now , is n't he ? ELLIS But even so . GANDERSHEIM ( embarrassed by the conversation , in a low voice to Judith ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They go over to the wall together , and he comments on the various bushes , but she keeps an ear out for the others and sometimes glances in their direction . FRANK Well , you 've lost your religious faith , you told me , and I hope you 've got some faith in Spotlight . This is a goddam critical situation : the whole issue of a free press is at stake  --  and it may mean saving an innocent man . With the power that the Peters have now , they might be able to railroad Percy to the chair . ELLIS I ca n't imagine that I 'm the right person ; but if you really think I could be any use  --   --  FRANK You can if you start right away and get around before they 've framed their case . Go to people in the other churches and find out where Keenan stood and who would have had an interest in killing him  --   --  p. 40 ELLIS I used to know Bishop Fay pretty well . FRANK If possible , get something on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back . ELLIS I should n't like to betray people 's confidence . FRANK Do n't worry : they would n't hesitate . The whole Peter business is a confidence game . I 've always said they ought to be hauled into court under the Blue Sky Law . They take money for priorities in Purgatory . ELLIS ( smiling ) . I 'm not sure I can be that hardboiled . FRANK It 's a matter of defending the decencies against gangs that do n't give a damn for them .  --  Now go and grab your suitcase and catch the 5.40 ! ( He takes out his watch and looks quickly at it . ) You 've only got twenty minutes . JUDITH ( coming back with Gandersheim ) . Are you actually going , Ellis ? ELLIS ( grinning self-consciously , but with a certain boyish enjoyment ) . I feel like a character in a spy story . GANDERSHEIM A Galahad ! FRANK ( to Ellis ) . Now scram . I 'll brief you on the way to the train . Ellis strides off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm absolutely thrilled by this , you know ! You 're a real man of action , are n't you ? FRANK And I 've got another brilliant idea ! You 're going to write for Spotlight ! GANDERSHEIM I 'm afraid I do n't have any talent for exposs and that kind of thing . FRANK It 's your stories I want , for God 's sake ! I 've never run any fiction , but your stories are something special . If your contract with Metropolitan is running out and they 're harassing you the way you say , why not let me publish your stuff ? Whatever they 've been paying you , I 'll better it . GANDERSHEIM I 'm not happy with Metropolitan , it 's true : not only are they ruining my prose , they 've been sticking me over in the back among the body-odor ads  --  and at the same time breaking up my stories with the most impossible illustrations of athletic-looking young men and women that contradict my whole uncanny atmosphere . FRANK Do n't worry about illustrations  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathing-suits or wooden brazeers.  --  We 'll have dinner in a minute or two . and we can talk about terms afterwards . GANDERSHEIM Oh , I wo n't stay to dinner !  --  I just dropped in. p. 42 FRANK Yes , you will  --  we 'll be eating right away . GANDERSHEIM ( looking toward Judith , as she does nothing to second the invitation ) . It ca n't be convenient for you to have me on such short notice . I 'll take the train with the young man . FRANK ( to Judith ) . Tell him to stay . JUDITH Yes : do stay . GANDERSHEIM I 'd be charmed if it 's really not too much trouble . JUDITH I 'll tell Bertha . ( She goes into the house . ) GANDERSHEIM ( to Frank ) . Since you 're kind enough to be interested in the Shidnats myth , you might like to know that it was first conceived right here in this very house . FRANK You do n't say ! GANDERSHEIM ( nodding toward the second floor ) . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to Gandersheim . The original series of stories , you know , were told in the first person . FRANK You mean the window where the landscape would change and be transformed into something unearthly ? p. 43 GANDERSHEIM Yes : the runes are carved above it . Did you notice them ? FRANK I 'll be damned  --  so that 's what that is ! GANDERSHEIM They 're not really carved , of course . I cut them out with my jigsaw when I was just a kid . That 's when the whole thing got started . FRANK Sit down . Frank drops back into his lounging-chair ; Gandersheim takes a seat in the straight chair at the right . It is beginning to get darker . GANDERSHEIM I had rather a lonely childhood  --  to explain how the whole thing came about . We lived out here with very few neighbors that we particularly cared to know  --  this locality had already ceased to be fashionable  --  and I was an only child . In the summers when I was not going to school , I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on the window-seat and imagine that if I looked out the window at just the right moment of twilight , I 'd suddenly see something different from the same old trees and fields  --  something exciting and troubling . Every summer we planned to travel , but we never got off on a decent trip . My mother was a professional invalid , and when the time for departure approached , she 'd always turn out to be ill . I see now that she was a hopeless neurotic , so the whole thing could have been predicted  --  but every time it was the same disappointment  --  I used just to collapse with despair when I was first told we could n't go  --  and then I 'd resign myself , try not to get too depressed but to keep myself keyed down to our stagnant life . I had to conjure up a new country that I could get to without leaving home  --  and that 's how Shidnats Slyme began : Shidnats was the god of that country . Ellis has come out of the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summer straw-hat with a striped blue-and-black band . Judith follows behind him . p. 44 ELLIS Well , I 'm off . ( To Frank ) I 'll need some money . FRANK ( pulling out his pocketbook ) . I 'll arrange for you to draw in town . ( Finding only ten dollars in his pocketbook ) Wait a minute ! ( He brings a checkbook out of the pocket of his coat and , taking a fountain-pen from his breast-pocket , sits down at the table and writes out a check . ) GANDERSHEIM ( to Ellis ) . Do I see a St. Matthew 's band ? ELLIS Yes . It 's high time I got a fall hat . GANDERSHEIM I went to St. Matthew 's . ELLIS Did you ? GANDERSHEIM I did n't finish , but I 'm proud of having been there , and it 's cheering to see that band . With so much vulgarity rampant and the ground quaking under one 's feet , it 's somehow reassuring to know that the old school still endures.  --  Were you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we heard a lot about him . GANDERSHEIM I had a warm admiration for him . He was a really imaginative person . He had the good taste not to fire me when I was caught reading a book on the Black Mass. p. 45 ELLIS You 're not Froggy Ferguson ? GANDERSHEIM I am . ELLIS By my time you 'd become a legend . Did you really hold rites in the lumber-room and offer up a Second-Form boy as a human sacrifice ? GANDERSHEIM ( rather pleased ) . No , of course not  --  that 's all nonsense . The worst thing we did up there was to burn a few bad-smelling chemicals . FRANK ( handing Ellis the ten-dollar bill and the check ) . Here you are . Cash this at your club . ELLIS Thanks . FRANK ( looking at his watch again ) . Now , let 's get started . ELLIS O.K. ( To Gandersheim , quickly shaking hands ) Nice to have seen you . ( Saluting Judith ) Wish me luck . JUDITH I do . He and Frank go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and beginning at once to instruct him . GANDERSHEIM ( to Judith ) . A splendid young chap , is n't he ?  --  and so plucky to go off in that way ! ( She is brooding and does not reply . ) St. Matthew 's does turn out gentlemen . I 'm sorry I did n't graduate . The old doctor did n't want to expel me  --  he did n't take my Satanism seriously ; but he punished me in a crushing way that ruined my whole spring term , and my mother was so indignant that she would n't let me go back the next fall  --  so I had only two years . I found myself stuck out here again . It was horrible , all wrong  --  I was too old to be at home . I really got to hate poor Mother . She had a noose around everyone 's neck  --  and when Father died and she was here alone , I knew that it was out of the question for me to think of going to college .  --  ( As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detachedly ) Please forgive all this reminiscence ! Coming out here has brought it back . p. 46 JUDITH When did you get off to Europe ? She sits down in the straight chair on the right . GANDERSHEIM Not till I was seventeen  --  but it probably saved me from going mad . I made Mother take me abroad and we lived two years in Florence . Then we came back to the States , so that Mother could get better medical attention , and , to everybody 's surprise , she died . I 'm afraid that my father had bored her to death  --  with his stuffy old business in Worth Street and his interest in the Civil War . He did get through the Crash , though . unscathed . He left me a small steady income  --  and , after my parents died , I had no real ties in this country , and my great friend was living in Florence , so I went back there and stayed  --  till the war began making things intolerable . I 'd always kept up this house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I never wanted to see it again , but I found when I came back to the States that it was the only place I really belonged . JUDITH I 'm sorry about the pigeons . GANDERSHEIM Well , of course , one ca n't hope to save everything  --  especially when one is n't here . I 'm delighted  --  quite thrilled  --  as a matter of fact , at finding you people so simpatico . I always have a certain sinking , a sensation almost like panic , when I first get back to this house . It 's the world of my adolescence  --  irresistible and yet repellent  --  and the horror of Shidnats Slyme always seems to be lurking for me here . He appeared to me first in this house . and ( with a deprecatory smile ) I still expect to find him in residence . He embodies himself sometimes in people , pretends to be a human being , but I always recognize his presence . I was telling you about my experience in Europe  --  my horrible qualms in that pension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was coming out here to see you . After all , what did I know about your husband ! The editor of a popular magazine  --  that might mean the Monster God ! I could n't imagine why such a man should bury himself in such a place unless he were an adept of the cult  --  or even an incarnation  --  Frank comes back through the gate . p. 47 GANDERSHEIM I was just telling your wife that this house has a peculiar emotional effect on me : I ca n't get over the notion that Shidnats is somewhere around . FRANK Well , I have n't seen that noisome green liquid oozing out from under any of the doors  --  though we 've had some serious trouble with the plumbing . GANDERSHEIM You keep him away ! You 're the power that works against him  --  the power that works for good . I was just telling your wife how happy I was to find a man like you in possession : an unterrified champion of all the things that Americans have got to keep if they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fighting my battles ! FRANK ( not displeased but cutting him short ) . Everybody 's got to fight !  --  Do you want to wash before dinner ? GANDERSHEIM If I might . FRANK There 's a bathroom at the left , right inside that door . GANDERSHEIM ( smiling ) . I know where the bathrooms are . FRANK ( grinning ) . Sorry : this business has distracted my mind . I forgot that you were in your own house . GANDERSHEIM I have a peculiar reason for remembering that first-floor bathroom ! p. 48 FRANK Was it a hideout for Shidnats Slyme ? Gandersheim gives a coy and eerie laugh and goes up the steps to the house . FRANK ( to Judith ) . By God , I 'm inspired today ! There was a moment when I thought it was getting me down , but then I made a big comeback ! JUDITH I think you 're making a mistake . FRANK About sending Ellis ? JUDITH Yes  --  about that Gandersheim , too . FRANK I know you do n't like his stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on just now in a perfectly loony way . He 's got delusions of persecution . FRANK He 's eccentric  --  nothing worse , I 'd say . JUDITH You 'll alienate your serious readers by printing that rubbish of his . You might just as well run a comicstrip ! FRANK If I like it , why should n't they ? I consider him a top-notch asset . His following 's been growing steadily . There 's no question about it : at the present time , he 's America 's Number One bugaboo-monger . JUDITH And Ellis is n't going to be able to do what you want him to do  --  even if he does n't get murdered . p. 49 FRANK I 've got a lot of confidence in him . JUDITH But he just is n't brash enough to walk in where he 's not wanted , and he 's too reserved himself to make people tell him things . FRANK He 's all steamed up about it  --  he 's just boyish enough to enjoy it . His innocence is his great advantage . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a general conspiracy not to see . JUDITH In the meantime , I suppose you realize that I 'll have to interview all the people and take all the telephone calls . FRANK I 'll get somebody out from the office . JUDITH No , you wo n't : you 'll decide as usual that there 's nobody there that can handle it . FRANK Do n't worry : you wo n't have to do it . JUDITH I think it would be a lot better if you 'd attend to some of those things yourself . FRANK Where would I get the time ? JUDITH After all , you do n't have to read proof  --  and it makes a bad impression on people never to be willing to see them . You seem to yourself so courageous , but you 're getting the reputation of always evading and hiding  --  and I do n't feel that I can take it again to be the person you hide behind . p. 50 FRANK You wo n't have to : you can go on gardening . JUDITH You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man does it all  --  and our friend here has done nothing but complain that things are n't the way they ought to be . FRANK Well , you wo n't have to do Ellis 's work . That 's that ! JUDITH Not that I 've got anything better to do . I 'm sure I do n't know what you think there is in this kind of life for me  --  I can tell you there is n't much . FRANK What 's the matter ? This sounds like last winter . I thought you 'd been liking it here lately . JUDITH I was . FRANK Well , what 's wrong now ? Tell me . JUDITH It 's just that you 're so completely inconsiderate when you begin throwing your weight around . FRANK How many times do you want me to tell you that I 'm going to get another secretary ? JUDITH It is n't only that . I was just getting everything organized , and now you 've sent Ellis away and spoiled it . FRANK It is n't as if he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . p. 51 FRANK Well , what 's to prevent your having it ? JUDITH I counted on Ellis for tennis . FRANK I 'll play , what the hell ! JUDITH No : you 're terrible . Nobody wants to play doubles with you . FRANK ( morosely , an idea dawning ) . You 're going to miss Ellis a lot ? JUDITH Of course I am . FRANK I see . The dinner gong is sounded . She starts for the house . FRANK ( following her ) . I did n't know you liked him that much . You were telling me he was too conventional . JUDITH I 've gotten to like him very much . FRANK Oh , God : another crush ! JUDITH You know that I like Ellis , and you sent him away on purpose . FRANK I swear I never gave it a thought ! JUDITH It 's your absolutely psychopathic jealousy  --  you do n't want me to have any friends ! They go up the steps , she first . FRANK Oh , do n't start that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off from everybody I like . FRANK We 'll talk about this later . JUDITH No , we wo n't ! She goes into the house , and he follows. @x Mid-October : half-past five in the afternoon . The work-room on the second floor of Gandersheim 's house , in which Frank and Judith are living . This was formerly an upstairs library but has been converted into a sort of editorial office ( Frank has his own study on the floor below ) , and now contains an incongruous mixture of the original library furniture with modern office equipment . The walls are paneled in dark stained oak in the style of the early nineteen hundreds . On the right , toward the front of the stage , the big bow-window , which was seen from the outside in Act I , makes a recess with a wide cushioned window-seat , and the audience have a glimpse of the panes , with the frieze of jigsaw " runes " above them , but they can not see out the window . In the middle of the back wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stands a clock surmounted by a small bronze figure and above which hangs a large steel engraving : the well-known nineteenth century group called Shakespeare and His Friends . On either side of the fireplace are bookcases that rise somewhat higher , in which the old leather-bound sets have partly been replaced by up-to-date reference books . One bookcase is ornamented with a large stuffed owl , the other with a terrestrial globe . There is a morris-chair , with a floor lamp beside it , in the corner to the right of the fireplace . In the left-hand corner , against the left wall , is an old mahogany desk , with a flap that comes down on hinges . It is open : there is a typewriter on it and a highbacked chair in front of it . Further forward along this left wall are a row of steel filing-cases and above them a bulletin board on which are tacked up schedules for coming issues of Spotlight , lists of articles or ideas for articles , etc . Further forward , there is a d that leads into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the audience can see the doorway as soon as the door is opened . Stretching across the middle of the room , parallel with the back wall and further back than the bow-window , stands a long plain unfinished table , on which are papers , pencils , pen and ink , ash-trays and cigarettes , newspapers and magazines and two green-shaded student-lamps , and around which are grouped several chairs . One of these , at the right-hand end , is the mate to the highbacked chair at the desk : the others are miscellaneous  --  some of them old-fashioned , with cushioned seats , others office furniture , hard and stiff . Judith , in harlequin glasses , a plain but smart working suit and a man 's shirt with a necktie and a buttoned-down collar , is sitting in the highbacked chair , at the end of the long table . editing a manuscript with an evidently ruthless hand . Ellis opens the door and comes in , leaving the door half open . He is carrying a brief-case , which he lays on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her glasses. ) p. 54 ELLIS You stood me up again . JUDITH I 'm sorry . I missed the nine forty-five , because Frank had taken the car  --  as usual , without telling me  --  and then I could n't get anybody to wait on me in that new Park Avenue place where they have those men 's clothes for women  --  the sales girls are getting so snooty that they do n't want to sell you anything  --  and then the taxi-driver took me West instead of East before I noticed where we were going  --  it may have been my fault : he said I told him West but I was sure I told him East . When I got to the Tally-Ho , you 'd gone . ELLIS I could n't wait : I had an appointment with the head of the Constitutionalist Committee . JUDITH I called you up , but you were n't there  --  then I did n't want to call from here . ELLIS Why ? On account of Frank ? JUDITH I 'd told him I was lunching with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JUDITH Have you seen him ? ELLIS Just for a minute . He said he was busy . JUDITH Was he nasty ? ELLIS The same as usual . p. 55 JUDITH He 's never very gracious , is he ? ELLIS He 's all right . They tell me that newspaper men are all more or less like that . JUDITH He 's really full of hate . ELLIS Why ? JUDITH Because he never was the newspaper man he wanted to be . He does n't know he 's frustrated , though , because he 's too extraverted . He does n't even know he 's extraverted . ELLIS Is n't that all right for a journalist ?  --  to submerge himself in public events ? JUDITH Frank does n't submerge himself  --  he 's always hiding away . He always makes somebody else grapple with the actual problems  --  you , for instance . ELLIS And I 've been no good at all . He sits down in a chair near the middle of the table , on the side that faces the audience . JUDITH But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have anything to do with that . It was all done by the Teniakis Bureau  --  that super-employment agency that Gilman was recommended by . They made the Cardinal 's secretary testify that he 'd been there through the whole interview and that the explosion or whatever it was did n't happen till after he 'd gone . p. 56 JUDITH But they accused him of laying the flashlight . ELLIS The secretary says that Gilman had nothing to do with the flashlight . So the whole thing is just as mysterious as ever . In the meantime , all the anti-Constitutionalist groups have been so much scared by the prospect of the Constitutionalists ' winning the elections that they 've all been working together to beat them , and you ca n't get them to talk about the murder or any delicate matter of that kind . It 's really the most amazing thing how well-disciplined these movements are . Even the high-school children : if you mention any public issue , they 'll reel off their latest directive , as if it were Boyle 's law of gases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , you have n't . Frank was just saying that for the first time you 'd made him " see the picture , " as he calls it . ELLIS He gave me a bawling-out on the phone the other day . JUDITH Do n't take it from him . Just snap back at him , and you 'll find he 'll always recoil . ELLIS I 'm not quite in a position to do that .  --  How 's Gandersheim working out as secretary ? JUDITH Frank thinks he 's wonderful , but I think he 's dreadful . ELLIS A little on the spooky side . p. 57 JUDITH What I really ca n't stand is that he 's making this place a headquarters for his nauseating brotherhood . He has hundreds of fans , it seems . He writes to them on paper with a phony crest , and they come out here to talk poltergeists with him . The truth is that Gandersheim 's myth is a literary power cult  --  for arm-chair romantics and second-rate pansies . ELLIS I 'd imagined that Shidnats Slyme was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him is ambivalent . ELLIS I have n't heard that word for ages . In my childhood people used it all the time . JUDITH It was indispensable then , because it gave a certain dignity to trying to have things both ways . ELLIS It could even be pronounced " ambilavent . " JUDITH And they would talk about " having a block . " Are you old enough to remember that ? To talk about " having a block " was a way of giving scientific standing to some humiliating deficiency  --  like not being able to spell  --  or a failure to keep some promise that you did n't want to keep . ELLIS That was what happened to you yesterday when you missed the train and all that . JUDITH I was really afraid of Frank . p. 58 ELLIS You do n't use that technique you were just recommending ? JUDITH I did n't want a quarrel . ELLIS Some other day maybe ? JUDITH Maybe . ELLIS How do Gandersheim 's followers go down with Frank ? JUDITH He stands for them because Gandersheim adores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickening . But Frank thinks it 's perfectly natural that people should be his abject slaves . ELLIS He 's not taken in , though , by people , beyond a certain point . JUDITH I 've never seen him gag at flattery . ELLIS Well , he 's got a great deal more shrewdness  --  and a great deal more independence  --  than most of those mugs I 've been seeing in town . All they want is to be yessed by their underlings , and then they yes their higher-ups . I have a real admiration for Frank . JUDITH Then you ought n't to ask me to lunch . ELLIS I miss you a lot . JUDITH You do n't . ELLIS I 've realized how much you 've meant to me since I 've been staying up there in town . p. 59 JUDITH Oh , no , I haven't.  --  What have I meant ? ELLIS You 're the only girl I ever knew who had the same kind of brains as a man and yet at the same time was perfectly beautiful . JUDITH New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen the latest crop of career girls . ELLIS You 're not a career girl . JUDITH How do you know ? ELLIS If you were , you would n't be out here . JUDITH But I do n't like being out here . This is n't really my role . Now that you 're away and with Gandersheim here , this place is getting me down . I 'm absolutely stuffy and stale . ELLIS Then meet me for a drink some day . You wo n't have to explain about it . JUDITH It 's too serious when you do n't explain . ELLIS Not necessarily , is it ? JUDITH It seems to work out that way . ELLIS Not that I 'm not prepared to be serious . JUDITH It 's better the way it is . What we have is a " joking relationship . " Did you ever study anthropology ? They talk about " joking relationships . " When a Navaho Indian , for example , meets one of his aunts on his father 's side , they 're supposed to exchange badinage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband 's secretary ought to do the same kind of thing . p. 60 ELLIS I should n't think that would always be a good idea . It would produce too many bad jokes . JUDITH Thank you ! ELLIS I did n't mean you . You 're brilliant . JUDITH I 'm not : I 'm getting so stupid that I could n't amuse a baby  --  though actually I do n't like babies , I never know what to do about them . ELLIS You do n't care for children . JUDITH No : not other people 's ! I would n't mind having some boys of my own  --  but I would n't like them when they were little . ELLIS ( after a brief pause , during which he has been asking himself whether he ought to go on with the subject ) . Maybe children are what you need . JUDITH I do n't know : I do n't want them now .  --  It may be too late for me to have them . ELLIS Not necessarily , is it ? JUDITH Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject ? Let 's drop it ! ELLIS You 're not sure you want to stay with Frank ? JUDITH I suppose that 's really it  --  though I usually give other reasons . I 'm fond of Frank , of course , but it 's not really right between us . He 's so much older than I am . I began by being his secretary , and I still ca n't help feeling like a secretary  --  a secretary who occasionally sleeps with the boss . p. 61 ELLIS But you married him . JUDITH It makes it easier if you 're living together in the country . Gandersheim has appeared in the doorway and stands listening to the conversation , concealed from Judith and Ellis by the partially closed door . ELLIS I thought that there was quite a lot more than that between you and Frank . JUDITH Oh , there was , I suppose , but  --  oh , I do n't know !  --  I guess maybe it 's just that nowadays I do n't even have a woman-friend to get together with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since you left . ELLIS ( getting up and coming over to her ) . I need somebody to confide in , too  --  so why do n't you meet me in town for a drink ?  --  and be sure to make it this time ! JUDITH I 've been having awful migraines lately  --  and when they hit me , I ca n't do anything . ELLIS ( smiling ) . Psychosomatic , no doubt ? JUDITH That 's another great comforting word . ELLIS Like " that blessed word Mesopotamia " that the old woman found in the Bible . p. 62 JUDITH Yes : of course " psychosomatic " is a mystical idea , is n't it ?  --  Something like the Incarnation . ELLIS You 're the brightest girl I ever knew . JUDITH Girl ? I 'm getting middle-aged . ELLIS Next Saturday ? JUDITH All right . She looks up at him , and he leans down and kisses her . They remain for a moment in silence , her mouth pressed against his . ELLIS ( straightening up ) . How about five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it earlier than that  --  I 'd have to get back well before dinner . ELLIS Four o'clock then ? JUDITH All right . Gandersheim quietly enters and closes the door behind him . He has a handful of unfolded letters . Ellis looks around and sees him . ELLIS ( to Gandersheim ) . Have you been having an awful time with all that ? GANDERSHEIM Oh , no : it comes quite easily . ( He goes over to the desk with the typewriter . ) ELLIS You 're wonderful at the brush-off , I understand . p. 63 GANDERSHEIM A touch of mystification helps . JUDITH ( whose feelings of guilt and of fear lest they may have been overheard leads her to propitiate Gandersheim ) . He 's the master of the evasive answer . He does n't just tell them that Frank is busy . He tells them something so utterly confusing that they 're frightened and go away . ELLIS ( to Gandersheim ) . How would you handle a specific case ? JUDITH Tell him how you disposed of the Elitist . GANDERSHEIM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was trying to pump me about Frank 's politics , and I explained to him that Spotlight 's position was that of a floating platform stabilized in interstellar space , and that Frank 's point of view was that of a celestial engineer whose problem was to keep it in place by maintaining a delicate balance between the different gravitational pulls . ELLIS Nice work . How did he take it ? GANDERSHEIM He asked me starkly which candidate Frank would support , and I replied that the function of Spotlight was not to support but to scrutinize . ELLIS Masterly ! I envy your resourcefulness. p. 64 JUDITH Tell him about the currency crank . GANDERSHEIM Oh , that was quite fantastic . A wild-eyed fellow appeared who had one of those panaceas for curing our economic ills . It was a perfectly simple device : you would issue some paper money that had double denominations  --  that is , there would be bills , for example , that had five dollars printed on one side and ten on the other side  --  and anybody who could certify that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the larger amount . ELLIS What was your flabbergasting answer ? GANDERSHEIM I told him that , from our point of view , all value was already relative , and that to issue a two-sided currency would only make things more complicated . ELLIS I 'm full of admiration . I never really had the right knack in dealing with the lunatic fringe . Frank comes in . FRANK We 're scooped ! ELLIS What ? FRANK That murder 's been pinned on the Reds . ELLIS ( getting up ) . Where did you hear that ? FRANK On the radio . It seems that the Teniakis Bureau has been working on the case , and they 've gotten the murderer 's sister to talk .  --  You 're a hell of an investigator ! p. 65 ELLIS Who is he ? FRANK That laboratory worker who 'd been to see the Cardinal that afternoon , just before Percy Gilman was there . You 'll remember he 'd once been a Red and then claimed to be converted to Peterism , and had come to talk to the Cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter papers . GANDERSHEIM How did he manage the murder ? FRANK They have n't gotten him to tell yet , but he 'd been working with inflammable gases . ELLIS Has he actually confessed to the crime ? FRANK He does n't need to : this sister has produced a letter he wrote her that shows he was still a Red long after he was supposed to have been converted . He and she had fallen out , because he 'd gone over to Belgrade when she still stuck to the Kremlin  --  and that 's the reason she 's decided , to expose him . I told you to go after their families . ELLIS I do n't like pumping people 's families . FRANK Hell  --  It 's a question of public peril ! ELLIS Well , I 'm glad I did n't have anything to do with making that woman talk  --   --  FRANK She was evidently crazy to talk . p. 66 ELLIS  --  And I doubt the value of her evidence . FRANK That would come better from you if  --   --  ELLIS ( asserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you disapprove of the methods these groups are using , but one of the worst features of it is the way they work on people systematically to destroy normal human relationships . There 's getting to be a premium on treachery  --   --  A knock on the door interrupts him . FRANK Yes ? The Gardener opens the door and , holding his old slouch hat , comes a short way into the room . THE GARDENER ( to Judith , with an Irish brogue ) . I 'm sorry to disturb you , ma'am , but did you want me to transplant the hydrangeas the first thing tomorrow morning ? I 've just done trimmin ' them back . JUDITH Oh , yes ! ( To Gandersheim ) I hope you approve of this . You do n't mind our moving them , do you ?  --  moving the hydrangeas to the stable ? GANDERSHEIM Well , I do , rather . I think it would be better , as I told you when you first brought the question up , to cultivate the original color . You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUDITH Could n't we move them back there for a while and feed them whatever they need till they 're blue ? GANDERSHEIM I should miss them  --  I should n't feel comfortable . I know that a hydrangea border is as out-of-date now as a boa , but , after all , the whole place is " period . " JUDITH I was going to plant a border of tulips . They 'd light up all that rather bleak approach to the house . GANDERSHEIM Oh , I should n't like that at all ! I 'm afraid I really could n't face tulips . I 've seen them at their most brilliant in Holland , and I must say they absolutely repel me  --  just a regiment of brash little prongs sticking up like pins in a map . I like my flowers a little less  --  bouncing . THE GARDENER Sure , you 've no need to worry about that , sir ; the missus has ordered some breeds that are speckled and striped like salamanders . They 're as unwholesome as anything you could wish . JUDITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrangeas are just sickly and sloppy now . Come down and look things over for once . You 've never really faced it . GANDERSHEIM I 'm afraid I must do these letters . FRANK Go on , Gandy  --  there 's no hurry about those . Let 's get this gardening crisis settled . It 's absolutely wearing me down , and the flowers have been looking lousy  --  I think they 're suffering from a sense of insecurity . p. 68 JUDITH ( to Ellis , sarcastically ) . That 's another favorite phrase from the forties ! Ellis gives her a brief grin , which registers his resentment of Frank . FRANK It 's been a permanent condition since then !  --  Now , go on  --  go and feed your hydrangeas ! Judith moves toward the door , and Gandersheim and the Gardener follow . JUDITH ( to Gandersheim ) . It seems that they spray them now instead of merely putting stuff in the soil . GANDERSHEIM I do think he 's right , you know : flowers should never be frightened . They go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the table nearest the audience ; Ellis remains standing . ELLIS I 'm sorry you think I 've fallen down  --  but I told you I was n't the man for that job . FRANK You ought to have seen that woman . ELLIS I admit that I 've been a failure , and I was just going to tell you that I want to quit . FRANK Now do n't get excited  --  I do n't want you to quit . ELLIS I 'm no good to you as a detective . p. 69 FRANK You 're new at it , that 's all . But do n't worry . We can drop our own investigation . I need you here now . ELLIS I meant , quit the job entirely . FRANK Leave the magazine , you mean ? ELLIS Yes : you 've got Gandersheim , and you do n't really need me now . FRANK He ca n't do everything : he 's got to write his stories . ELLIS I understand he has an irresistible magic for exorcising unwelcome visitors . FRANK To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been getting a little too four-dimensional since Gandersheim has been handling things . I like to have everything in black and white , and I miss your clear-cut methods . ELLIS You can easily get somebody else who 'll copy out the letters in a big round hand . FRANK It 's the point of view I ca n't get . You have the Spotlight point of view . ELLIS But what is the Spotlight point of view ? It 's having no point of view at all . FRANK I thought you were sympathetic with what I 'm trying to do . ELLIS I am , I suppose  --  but good Lord , I ca n't see that you make much impression on the tendencies you 're trying to check . You could n't even get Gilman out of jail . It took that employment bureau . p. 70 FRANK Yes : you have to hand it to Teniakis . He certainly looks after his people . Gandersheim comes into the room . GANDERSHEIM ( to Frank ) . If you 'll pardon me just a moment , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to have an old one here . FRANK Go ahead  --  all your books are still there . Gandersheim goes over to the bookcase at the right of the fireplace . ELLIS ( to Frank , picking up the brief-case ) . I 'll just take care of this stuff I brought out . May I go down to your room , where it 's quicker ? FRANK ( morosely ) . Go ahead . GANDERSHEIM ( taking down a volume ) . I suppose this is quite out of date . Judith says they spray them now . FRANK This is a hell of a note ! Ellis has just announced he 's quitting . GANDERSHEIM I 'm not entirely surprised . FRANK What do you mean ? GANDERSHEIM Well , I hesitate to mention the matter  --  and anything I say , you understand , is said in the strictest confidence . p. 71 FRANK Go ahead . GANDERSHEIM Well , I believe that Ellis  --  who is a very well-brought-up young man  --  has a very strong sense of honor . FRANK So he was telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing  --  I do n't mean about the sister . FRANK What do you mean ? GANDERSHEIM Well , I do n't really think that he 'd want to stay on with Spotlight , if  --  if  --  well , if he was in a position in which he felt he was abusing your confidence . FRANK You mean he 's gone over to the Reds ? GANDERSHEIM No , no : I meant something more personal . A pause : Frank stands frowning and brooding . Gandersheim finds the place in the book . FRANK You do n't mean Judith ? GANDERSHEIM ( looking up for a moment , then examining the encyclopedia article ) . On his side a little , perhaps . FRANK What gives you that idea ? GANDERSHEIM Well , one notices certain things  --  and quite without design on my part , I overheard a conversation just now  --   --  Judith comes in. p. 72 JUDITH ( to Gandersheim ) . You got away from me before I was done with you . GANDERSHEIM I just came up here to look up the hydrangeas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to take it up with the gardener . JUDITH I wanted you to go all over the place with me , but you slipped away into the pergola , and when we looked there , you 'd disappeared . GANDERSHEIM ( flustered by Judith 's appearance ) . I 'm entirely at your service . JUDITH Do n't be scared : I 'm not going to try to put anything more over on you . ( To Frank ) He did give in about the tulips . GANDERSHEIM So very few things nowadays are allowed to remain the same . FRANK Go on and thrash it out with the gardener , Gandy  --  I want to talk to Judith . JUDITH ( to Frank ) . If he succeeds in escaping me now , I 'm afraid I 'll never get him again ! GANDERSHEIM I do n't see that you really need me , since you 've quite made up your mind about everything . FRANK ( to Judith ) . Let him alone  --  let him talk to the gardener : he 'll get along better without you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes out with a piqued air of dignity . Frank pretends to look at a manuscript till Gandersheim has left the room . p. 73 JUDITH ( hardly waiting for the door to close ) . I hope you do n't think it 's a treat for me to have the landlord living here with us and interfering with all my arrangements . FRANK He 's certainly been a godsend to me . JUDITH I do n't think you ought to let him do so much  --  especially answering letters . You 've already got the reputation of being an eccentric and a crank , and now people will say you 're crazy . FRANK It at least means that you do n't have to attend to them . You were complaining that you 'd have to do everything . In some ways he 's the most satisfactory person that I 've ever had in that job . JUDITH That 's just because he turns cartwheels for you whenever you open your mouth . He 's absolutely infatuated with you . FRANK I 'm glad somebody is . JUDITH It I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing I find embarrassing is having you be rude to Gandy  --  and openly hostile to me . JUDITH I 'm sorry , Frank , but this whole situation has become absolutely impossible . I was just going to tell you : I want to get a job in town . p. 74 FRANK What 's the matter now ? JUDITH I ca n't go on like this . I 've got nothing to do out here . FRANK I thought that you were just telling me that housekeeping was giving you so much to do that you had n't any time for anything else ! JUDITH The trouble is I 'm not a housewife . I 've tried it , and I know I 'm no good at it . FRANK Yes , you are . JUDITH No , I 'm not . I do n't have any chance at all to do the kind of thing I can do . FRANK You 've been wonderful with the magazine . JUDITH You want to be the whole thing yourself  --  you do n't even really want my suggestions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary  --   --  JUDITH I 've decided that the moment for a break has come . I 'm losing all my resiliency out here . Jane Hunter was saying the other day that I 'd become so suburban and wholesome that she could hardly believe I was the same girl who 'd made the Dean cry at college . FRANK You 're in better shape now than you ever were ! It 's the first time you 've ever been tanned . JUDITH I 'm not the type that ought to be tanned . I wanted to try this tennis-playing life , but now that I 've had it , it bores me . I ca n't be a young country club matron  --  especially when you wo n't go near the club  --  and even the club out here is second-rate. p. 75 FRANK Sit down and let 's talk about it . JUDITH I do n't want to sit down and talk about it . We 've talked about it enough . FRANK What 's the matter lately ? JUDITH Nothing 's the matter except that I 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine time to walk out on me . Did you know that Ellis was quitting ? JUDITH Did you fire him ? FRANK No , of course I did n't fire him . He 's gotten his feelings hurt . JUDITH I do n't wonder , the way you 've been treating him . FRANK What do you mean , the way I 've been treating him ? JUDITH You were insulting to him just now . FRANK No , I was n't . JUDITH Of course you were . You 're such a born bully that you 're not even able to realize that you 're habitually insulting to people . FRANK On the contrary , you bully me : you 've got me afraid to open my mouth .  --  ( Expostulating and waving his arms ) Listen , Judy : when you and I work together , we 're wonderful  --  we can stand up to anything . But when we break loose against one another , we simply use up all our energies and do n't accomplish anything . p. 76 JUDITH That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be independent . FRANK ( coming over to her and taking both her hands ) . Listen , darling : you know that I ca n't live without you . JUDITH Those nostalgic clichs of yours ! I wish you could get along without them when you 're making your big scenes . FRANK You sound like one of those heroines from the " live-your-own-life " period . JUDITH Yes , of course : the whole thing is old hat  --  this is the kind of perfectly obvious situation that there 's no point in making a fuss about . FRANK Now , look here  --  ( he puts his arm around her and leads her over to the head of the table ) I want you to sit down a minute and listen to me talk  --   --  JUDITH I 've been doing that for years . FRANK Not many . JUDITH Four . FRANK All right , but this is not a mere oration . Sit down here . He makes her sit down in the first chair at the right behind the table and takes his place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUDITH You 're going to tell me that you divorced your wife to marry me , and that I prevent you from seeing your daughter . FRANK No , I 'm not . JUDITH You usually do at this point . FRANK First of all , what I want to say is that you ought to know it 's actually true when I tell you that I ca n't get along without you . It 's not a clich , it 's the literal fact . You 've been the mainspring of Spotlight  --  you inspired it in the first place . Everything I 've done since I 've known you has been done on account of you . Though I 'd been a fair success before , I 'd only been a glorified hack . I was an old-style newspaper man , well on the way to obsolescence  --  and the big turning-point in my life was that night when I lectured at your college and you came up to ask me questions , with your hair done up in a bun and your panther eyes flashing out challenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. R. had the virtues of a tactful hostess ?  --  that he knew how to diminish friction and prevent disagreeable incidents , but had no real ideas of his own ? Do you remember how you said that ? JUDITH ( pleased as always at praise but not wanting to acknowledge it ) . No . FRANK Well , it made a sensational impression on me . I was jolted and shocked at first , but then I was released , delighted . It was just what I 'd been thinking myself but would n't have had the nerve to say or would n't have been able to say that well . I thought that you were the brightest girl I 'd ever seen . I had n't known such girls existed  --  and I do n't believe they ever did before . What 's always been miraculous to me and what 's given me such guts as I 've had lately has been just exactly that fact : that an obstinate old-timer like me , a journalist who still takes journalism seriously , an American who still believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of civilization  --  that a person like me had made contact , an actual vital contact , with one of the most gifted young people of your nineteen-forty crop that grew up without any illusions . The thing that I was proudest of was your telling me that you had more respect for me than for the boys of your own generation . Do you remember telling me that ? p. 78 JUDITH ( in a tone which implies that she remembers but is no longer interested in it ) . Yes . FRANK I do n't want to hand myself bouquets , but I think I did give you something . You kids were born into a world where the money had all blown up and nobody knew where they were at . The first batch consoled themselves with Communism , but then , when Soviet Russia went bad , they did n't know where the hell to turn . The next batch were shipped off to war , which they were n't enthusiastic about , and the later ones who 'd missed the war found themselves shunted off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war about , which they were even less enthusiastic . Now , I 'd had the luck to grow up in a small-sized Western city , where my dad ran an independent paper and where he 'd somehow managed to survive as a ring-tailed gyascutus of Populism from the heroic Bryan period  --   --  JUDITH I 've heard all this before , you know . FRANK Not so eloquently expressed , have you ?  --  What I wanted to say was simply that you gave me the spark that ignited me  --  that made me flame up again when I might well have smouldered out  --   --  JUDITH Oh , Frank , your old moth-eaten metaphors ! FRANK ( going on even more ardently , since he knows that , in spite of her mockery , she is gratified by his admiration ) . " Flame up " is the only way to say it  --  it is n't even a metaphor . At that time you were a burning brand , but you were just being reckless and negative  --  your audacity had no real object  --   --  p. 79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's more like a pilot-light on one of those gas-ranges , and if I do n't have a new cylinder put in , there 's just going to be a faint bad smell and you 'll know that the gas has gone out . FRANK And is Ellis your new cylinder ?  --  ( with sarcasm ) to carry on with your up-to-date imagery . JUDITH I knew that was coming ! FRANK Well ? ( She does not reply : he gets up . ) You have n't answered my question . JUDITH There 's nothing between Ellis and me . FRANK You were complaining that you missed him so much . JUDITH Why should n't I ? He 's closer to me than you are , because he 's nearer my age . We can understand one another with just a look  --  just an inflection  --  we do n't have to have all these long arguments and historical recapitulations . FRANK And that 's why you want to go to town , is n't it ? JUDITH Is what why I want to go to town ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think he had any idea of it when I saw him before he came upstairs . You 'd talked to him in between . p. 80 JUDITH He did n't say a word to me about his job . FRANK You influenced him to throw it up . JUDITH You influenced him yourself by being so nasty to him . FRANK I do n't think he 's sore at me . The trouble is he 's interested in you , and he thinks he 's being disloyal . JUDITH ( getting up ) . I wo n't stand for this any more ! If there were no other reason for getting away , these continual scenes of jealousy would be enough . FRANK So you walk out on me at the worst possible moment ! Just because you were deserted yourself , you try to revenge yourself by walking out on other people ! JUDITH No one ever walked out on me ! FRANK But your parents died before you were six  --  and you 've never gotten over it . JUDITH This psychoanalytic routine of yours is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRANK You ca n't help being bitter , maybe  --  but I think you ought to keep it well in mind what you 're really being bitter about . It 's not me  --  it 's not anything I 've done to you  --   --  p. 81 JUDITH You promised me not to talk about that . FRANK ( determined , in desperation , to make some impression on her ) . You ought to be reminded of it when you 're trying to blame somebody else for the fact that your parents  --   --  JUDITH ( resisting in real alarm ) . Now , do n't ! FRANK  --  For the fact that your parents were victims of the damned frauds and swindles of Wall Street  --   --  JUDITH You promised . If you break your promise , I 'll never have any more respect for you ! FRANK That your father was ruined in the Crash , and that he shot your mother and then shot himself when you were in the next room . ( She becomes pale and rigid , can not speak . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  because I think you ought to face it . You 're making a big mistake when you try to shut it out of your mind : that only gets you all confused . It makes you think that I 'm your father , so that you work up a grudge against me  --  a completely irrational grudge . I 'm not your father  --  I 'm your husband . I love you  --  I love you , darling  --  and it 's a hell of a raw deal for me to have to be identified with him  --   --  p. 82 JUDITH ( screaming ) . Oh , how can you ? How can you ? You promised me you never would ! How can you , you great horrible lout ! ( She throws a magazine from the table at him . ) You pretentious small-time tyrant ! FRANK ( coming over to her ) . Do n't  --   --  I 'm sorry  --  JUDITH ( hysterical , grasping his hand 's , as he tries to put his arms around her ) . Do n't hit me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to kill me ! ( Shrieking ) Help ! Gandersheim opens the door and enters ; the Gardener hangs behind in the doorway . GANDERSHEIM I 'm sorry . I hope I 'm not interrupting . Judith leaves the room , weeping . FRANK Judy is in one of her states . It 's not so bad as it sounds . GANDERSHEIM Is there anything I can do ? FRANK No , thanks . She 'll be all right . GANDERSHEIM I was just bringing the gardener in to show him the encyclopedia. p. 83 FRANK Go ahead . He hurries out . GANDERSHEIM ( to the Gardener ) . Come in . I 'll just read you what it says . He picks up the volume from the table and finds the place again . The room is already half dark , and he carries the book over to the window-seat . He is agitated but tries to hide it and sits down behind the table to consult the book . During the conversation that follows , the room is growing dark . GANDERSHEIM You know , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the flowers are actually sexless and sterile : they do n't have either stamens or pistil . But they certainly make a brave showing !  --  that is , when they 're properly nourished  --  and that 's our problem now : to get them back to their brilliant blue . They do look rather livid now  --  as if the dye were all running out of them . They ought to be a brilliant rather frightening blue  --  I 've always found blue rather frightening  --  and the color does have its significance in connection with my life in this house . My mother had piercing blue eyes , but it is n't only my mother 's eyes . It 's got something to do with the blues  --  I do n't mean the musical blues , but what I used to call le cafard blafard  --  that 's a French phrase I made up once . I thought I could n't stand it here at first when she would n't send me back to school , but I managed to settle down to it and somehow nourished myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as we hope our hortensias will  --  that 's a much more beautiful name for them , I think  --  and I got to like the old blue border , because it represented my mood .  --  ( Looking up from the book ) Tell me , do you believe in dreams ? I see now that you 're really an Irishman  --  and all you Irish are great dreamers , are n't you ? p. 84 THE GARDENER Sure , I 've had some quare dreams in my time , and the worst of them always came true . GANDERSHEIM Prophetic , eh ? THE GARDENER I 'm a bit on the prophetic side maybe . It 's necessary , of course , to interpret them . GANDERSHEIM I wish you 'd interpret this dream of mine . I 've had it again and again just since I 've been back in this house  --  and , for some reason I do n't understand , it 's indescribably dreadful . THE GARDENER If you tell me what it is , I 'll be glad to try . GANDERSHEIM Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly normal street . The sun is out , and everything is cheerful  --  the people are all going about their business . I come to a house and I knock at the door . No one answers : I go in . The house is completely empty and perfectly commonplace . But there 's a thing waiting for me in there  --  quietly waiting for me : I have to come to it . I walk through the rooms and the hallway and out through the backdoor  --  and there in the backyard , just hanging in the air above my head , is the paralyzing unspeakable thing . It makes my blood run cold just to think of it , and I have n't even had the courage to put it into one of my stories ! It 's just a little spark of blue light that might be made by crossed electric wires  --  but I know that I ca n't resist it , that it 's certainly going to get me . I always wake up at that point , but even then I ca n't shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sunk in the mosthideous despair  --  and I do n't know why it should be  --  I ca n't make out where the image comes from . It 's just a quiet little point of light , but it 's pitiless , it 's infinitely cruel ! p. 85 THE GARDENER Would ye care to say what 's frightened ye most in your life ? GANDERSHEIM Oh , it would be hard to say . I 've always been subject to panics of the kind that are called irrational  --  as if something were going to pounce on me , to take possession of me . I had a touch of it just now outside when she was bullying me about the hydrangeas  --  and then when we walked in on that scene , I was suddenly all unnerved ! THE GARDENER Would it maybe be the piercing blue eye that you say your mother had  --  that little blue light you 're scared of ? GANDERSHEIM Oh , please ! I 've been all through Freud . THE GARDENER And did you not learn anything from it ? GANDERSHEIM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plots  --  and even more with some of my friends who fancied themselves as Freudian characters . THE GARDENER Sure , it 's true that the case-histories have turned into myths and that people feel they have to act them out . But there 's some truth in all great myths . They can teach us what to expect . GANDERSHEIM What a knowledgeable old chap you are ! My childhood does come back on me rather here , with everything that was nastiest about it . But I do n't know where else to go . p. 86 THE GARDENER I 'm in the same situation meself . GANDERSHEIM You 've never thought of going back to the old country ? THE GARDENER To Ireland ? Faith , Ireland today is as bad as the rest of the world ! GANDERSHEIM The Irish have at least won their freedom . THE GARDENER They 've won their freedom the same way as the Russians . They 've lost all their men of vision . When they were victims of a monarchical tyranny , they had rebels , and the rebels had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when the people came into their own , they were content to be tyrannized over by police captains and politicians , paperwork-men and priests . So I 'm better off here than there . There 's still some hope in a house like this . GANDERSHEIM Do you think so ? It 's rather been getting me down . THE GARDENER Do n't be scared of the lady , sir . GANDERSHEIM My mother ? THE GARDENER That , too . GANDERSHEIM You mean Judith ? THE GARDENER She 's far more scared than you . GANDERSHEIM You surprise me ! p. 87 THE GARDENER Sure , she 's frightened of her own shadow , for she thinks it must cast a contagion on everything it falls upon . GANDERSHEIM On account of that dreadful thing , you mean ?  --  her father shooting her mother ? THE GARDENER It 's both grievance and guilt she feels , and nothing can make up the loss . GANDERSHEIM One could pity her a little more easily if she were n't so extremely aggressive . I really ca n't take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now  --  when she made me sacrifice those hydrangeas  --  I could n't resist my little revenge  --  though it may have been rather unfair  --  it did upset me when I heard her screaming . Not that she would have hesitated a moment to take advantage of me . She 's one of these modern women who want to have equality for the sexes , but they do n't have the same sense of honor as men , and you ca n't always meekly submit to being made a ninny of . There are moments in modern life when you have to fight a bitch in the same spirit . THE GARDENER ( interrupting him ) . Sure , you ca n't see to read by that light . ( He turns on one of the student-lamps and moves it up to illuminate the book . ) Now what has the encyclopedia to tell us about the hydrangeas ? p. 88 GANDERSHEIM Thank you . Oh , yes : let me see . Here it is : you can put iron or alum in the soil .  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could really revive the hydrangeas , if we could get them to blaze a splendiferous blue , it might make that blue light burn a little bit dimmer . Do you think so ?  --  I 'm just talking nonsense  --  it 's only poetical nonsense . One does n't have to explain poetry to an Irishman . THE GARDENER ( reading over his shoulder ) . " Late in autumn , after frost , when the leaves have fallen , the plants may be moved to a frost-proof cellar and kept rather dry till spring , They may then be repotted with new soil . " GANDERSHEIM I do hope they wo n't die in the meantime ! p. 89 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT II : SCENE 2 The same room . Early December : eleven o'clock in the morning . Frank and Gandersheim are sitting at the table  --  Frank in the highbacked chair , Gandersheim about four feet away from him , on the opposite side from the audience . Gandersheim has lying before him a neat pile of manuscripts , on the top page of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper for the editors to write their comments on ; Frank is sorting out a more disorderly lot . He picks up a typewritten list . FRANK Well , here 's the contents of the first January issue . First : A Slap-Happy New Year . That 's an editorial by me . My idea is that the American people have taken such a beating in the last election that such of them as are rejoicing over it are actually goofy with punishment . ( He hands the manuscript to Gandersheim , who laughs appreciatively as he lays it face down beside him . ) The Washington Iron Curtain . " Iron Curtain " is a hell of an old phrase now  --  and what I 'd really like to call it is The United States : Top Secret  --  but I wanted to write a leader : Is the Human Race Top Secret ? GANDERSHEIM That 's brilliant . Why do n't you save it then ? FRANK That 's what I think I will . All right : let the Iron Curtain go . ( He hands the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Maybe we 'll think of something better later . The next is The Mechanical Brain and the Gettysburg Address . p. 90 GANDERSHEIM I have n't seen that . FRANK It 's a hell of a good article ! ( He hands it to Gandersheim , who glances through it . ) It shows that this so-called machine that thinks may be able to play chess and translate and correct examination papers , but it could n't produce a Gettysburg Address  --  that is to say , if you set it for the occasion and place and for a certain number of words , the best it could possibly do would be to string a lot of cliches together .  --  Twentieth Floor Express : An Elevator-Man Looks at Life . You 've got that . Did you fix it up ? GANDERSHEIM ( taking it out of his pile and putting it with the others ) . I did the best I could . FRANK It 's interesting , though , do n't you think ? That impulse he has in the lunch-hour to drop the elevator with everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRANK Next : Pressure Personalities , Five ( handing it to Gandersheim , who looks to see the rest of the title before adding it to the pile as before ) . This one is Luke Teniakis . GANDERSHEIM I do n't think I know about him . FRANK He 's the fellow who runs that Bureau that sent us Percy Gilman  --  and got him exonerated . He 's not an important figure , but he 's a hell of an admirable guy , and I wanted to have him in . Here 's a little Greek delicatessen dealer who comes over here without a cent and who builds up something unique : an employment agency that sticks by its clients  --  just because he remembered his own hard times .  --  Then here 's a nostalgic piece : When We Skated in Rockefeller Plaza : A Glimpse of Old New York . ( Gandersheim finds it . ) O.K. Here 's the first of a new series : My Moment of Supreme Indifference . ( He finds the manuscript and hands it to Gandersheim . ) That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a couple of series like that in other magazines : one on . The Happiest Moment of My Life and one on My Proudest Day . Well , I thought it would be a good idea to have people write up the moments when they felt the most complete indifference about the things that they were supposed to take seriously . p. 91 GANDERSHEIM I did n't know about that either . Was it your idea ? FRANK No : Judy 's . GANDERSHEIM Oh ! FRANK This first one 's maybe a bit obvious : When I Missed the Train for my Wedding . GANDERSHEIM ( smiling on one side of his mouth ) . That will offend people , wo n't it ? FRANK Just scandalize them a little . The others strike more of a heroic note  --  about people who felt perfect indifference when they thought they were falling to their deaths in planes or missing out on their Hollywood options .  --  Then here 's the second political : Did the Election Lose Us Our Liberties ?  --  And special American problems : Can the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manuscript . ) GANDERSHEIM Do you want those two question-titles ? FRANK Right you are . ( He rewrites one of them . ) The Twilight of the Apache . All right . ( He hands Gandersheim the articles. )  --  When the Rue de la Paix Moved to Seventh Avenue . That 's the only article for women this month  --  but it 'll have to be enough . ( He looks for the manuscript. ) p. 92 GANDERSHEIM I do n't think we ought to cater to them . That 's the trouble with American magazines . They 're all just as feminine as Harper 's Brazeer . FRANK That 's always been my idea . Goddam it , the very sports departments are written for women now . You 've got that one , have n't you ? ( Gandersheim looks in his pile. )  --  Next number : Pretzel-Bending : A Vanishing Skill . You 've got that one , too . GANDERSHEIM ( taking them out ) . You do n't think we 're overdoing the nostalgic note just a tiny bit this month ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me we 're saying farewell to such a lot of things : we 're kissing the Apaches goodby  --  and pretzels and our political liberties and skating in Rockerfeller Plaza , all in the same issue . FRANK ( studying the list ) . By God , I believe you 're right . GANDERSHEIM I suggest taking out the pretzels and putting in The Slot-Machine Swindle  --  we 've had it around for a year . FRANK I ca n't seem to bring myself to run that damn thing . It makes our exposes look so picayune . The slot-machine is n't always working , so the customer loses his nickel or does n't get his gum  --  so what ? But all right : put it in . Let 's get it over with !  --  Now we come ( with his ironical emphasis ) to your monsterpiece , which has n't materialized yet : The Horror at the North Window : The Professor Faces Shidnats. p. 93 GANDERSHEIM I 'll have it ready by the end of the week . I 'm finding it more difficult than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's never been described directly  --   --  FRANK He 'd better be sensationally horrible after the build-up you 've been giving him for years . GANDERSHEIM It will take a little doing . I 'm not really sure how he looks  --  whether he 's frightening in an obvious way or something that seems innocent in itself  --  something like a little blue light . FRANK I thought he was a hideous monster . GANDERSHEIM The other thing has great possibilities  --  a terrible little blue light  --   --  FRANK That 's too abstract : your readers would feel they were n't getting their money 's worth . GANDERSHEIM That 's why I must get it exactly right . FRANK What you 've made people expect is a hair-raising demon . GANDERSHEIM That 's just why the other would be more of a surprise . The Professor is looking out the window , and he sees what he takes at first for a star that he does n't recognize  --  but then he becomes aware that it 's hanging right over the garden  --  then it seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pane . ( He turns toward the bay-window and gestures ; Frank looks toward the window , too . ) The next time , it 's there in the room  --  even though the lights are on : does n't that give you a queer twinge ?  --  quietly and steadily shining , but with devilish deadly intensity  --  with a ray like an old-fashioned hatpin that will stick you right-through the brain  --   --  p. 94 FRANK Well , that 's an unpleasant thought , but it seems to me a little too special . As a Gandersheim fan , I 'll be bitterly disappointed if I do n't get a bang-up bugaboo with a definite personality . GANDERSHEIM I 'm not sure that Shidnats Slyme has anything so human as a personality . He takes possession of other people 's personalities . In his non-incarnate state , he 's simply a force that blights and kills , the cruellest thing that exists  --   --  FRANK You would n't gather that from the name ?  --  Where did you get that name , by the way ? GANDERSHEIM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories , but a few of my readers have guessed . Do you know what my initials stand for ?  --  the initials of my real name ? FRANK M. S. ? No : what ? GANDERSHEIM Myles Standish . ( He pauses expectantly . ) FRANK I do n't get it . GANDERSHEIM Spell Myles Standish backwards . FRANK ( grinning ) . I see ! But why treat a good name like that ? GANDERSHEIM It 's a real desecration , I know . I was named after Myles Standish , because he was an ancestor of mine . But it was something I cooked up as a boy . Actually , I was awfully proud of coming of Mayflower stock . All the people around here were much richer than we  --  they were all manufacturers and suchlike . My father was a business man , too , but I liked to think that we were different , because he was a linen importer , and the firm was very old , with a distinguished brass plate on the building . But what I was proudest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the right to despise all these people we were living among out here  --  people , who made hardware and baking-powder  --  because they were parvenus  --  however much they might be rolling in money and however much they might beat me at tennis . p. 95 FRANK Then why pervert your Mayflower name ? GANDERSHEIM My fantasy was that I was Standish  --  that Standish was among them and they did n't know it , were n't able to appreciate him . They thought I was just a sissy , just a hateful little brat , but all the time I was one of the giants , the leader of the Plymouth Colony , an instrument chosen by a jealous God to make His will prevail . And yet , while Big Business prevailed , I had to work underground , I had to assume a disguise  --  so I turned my name around to make it sound as unpleasant and outlandish as I thought they must think I was  --   --  FRANK That would be a story in itself  --  you ought to write it someday  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on The Horror at the North Window ? Thursday 's your deadline , remember . ( He goes on reading his list . ) Well , here 's the sporting piece : Muskallonge-Fishing in Michigan . ( Finding it and picking it up ) We 've got to get a better title . GANDERSHEIM Unmasking the Muskallonge ? FRANK I do n't see the point to that . GANDERSHEIM Well , it says that  --   --  FRANK Misleading the Muskallonge  --  that 's no good either . Outsmarting the Muskallonge !  --  that 'll do . ( He changes the title with pencil . ) Outsmarting the Muskallonge.  --  And finally , Judy 's nightlife  --  it has n't appeared , I suppose ? p. 96 GANDERSHEIM ( smugly ) . Not to my knowledge . FRANK Jesus , I wish she 'd at least call me up ! She wanted to catch the opening of Pinky 's Place , but that was two nights ago . It 's a hell of a damn nuisance having your wife as a regular contributor ! GANDERSHEIM Her articles are making a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price I pay for them ! She stays away practically the whole week . The household is going to pieces , and if I want to see anything of her , I have to go up to town and spend an evening in some ghastly dive . GANDERSHEIM I do n't know whether you know that she was mentioned the other day in connection with Pappadapoulos , the man who runs Pinky 's Place . FRANK ( disregarding this ) . I do n't see what people get out of those places ! Have you been to a night-club lately ? They 're mass propositions now , just like everything else . They remind you of the old-fashioned beer-gardens , except that they have none of the things that used to make beer-gardens comfortable . GANDERSHEIM Judy seems to find them worth while . FRANK The kids of her age never knew a time when anything was any good . p. 97 GANDERSHEIM No : of course , they 've never known  --  but we know .  --  We have many things in common , Frank . I feel sometimes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! FRANK ( not much liking this ) . I do n't see that entirely . GANDERSHEIM ( slightly hurt ) . Oh , I do n't mean we are n't very different in a great many obvious ways . Of course I 'm an Easterner , an aesthete , what 's usually called a dreamer  --  ( Frank picks up a pile of mail and begins going through it rapidly , tearing the envelopes open , glancing at the enclosures and throwing them aside . ) I 've travelled , become cosmopolitan ; while you 're very much the Westerner and the rugged practical man : you stick by the country and its mores . And yet both of us represent the same old American thing : an individualistic idealism . We 're two faces of the same coin  --  and it was written that we should land up here , in this silly old house of mine , working on the same brave project . Deep down , we 're inseparable , inextricable . Nobody who had n't been bred in the American tradition of The Rights of Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I can say that no one who did n't have Melville and Poe in his blood could ever have  --   --  p. 98 FRANK ( staring at a letter he has opened ) . Well , I 'm a son of a bitch ! GANDERSHEIM What is it ? FRANK A threat , by God ! An anonymous letter ! GANDERSHEIM Let me see it . ( He takes the letter . ) How curious ! It 's not illiterate , as so many anonymous letters are . FRANK ( getting up and standing behind him ) . Look at the way it 's written ! It 's as pompous as an official communication ! ( Reading ) " Frank Brock is hereby notified that , as from date of receipt of this letter , he must discontinue at once the publication of his scheduled series , Pressure Portraits . The consequence of failing to comply with this order will be prompt incapacitation through violence , in the fullest and most definitive physical meaning of the phrase . This warning is not the production of an unbalanced individual but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with improved equipment for the implementation of its policies . " GANDERSHEIM " Incapacitation through violence in the fullest sense of the phrase "  --  do you think that means they 're threatening to kill you ? What a very peculiar way of putting it ! p. 99 FRANK It 's simply damn badly written , in this typical bureaucratic jargon that 's been rampant ever since the war . If I knew their goddam address , I 'd put it into decent English and send it back . GANDERSHEIM ( still looking at the letter ) . You 'd better think right away about getting police protection . I wonder what they 're threatening to do . You know , I 'm convinced that there 's some new kind of weapon that nobody 's got on to yet . We still do n't know how Cardinal Keenan was murdered  --  and then there was that postmaster in New Rochelle who was found burned to death the other day  --  the papers did n't pay much attention to it , but it was queer and it has n't been explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuisance I 'd hoped to avoid  --  and to hell with it !  --  I 'm not going to do a thing . I 'll just go on running the series as scheduled . GANDERSHEIM You 've got more nerve , Frank , than anybody I 've ever known , and I 'm right by your side all the time . If they should get you  --   --  FRANK Is that Judy ? ( He listens intently for her step . ) GANDERSHEIM ( finishing a little lamely ) .  --  They 'd get me , too . Judith enters . She is very smartly dressed ; has changed her way of doing her hair and has evidently been given the works at a beauty parlor . She has entirely dropped the magazine editor and is blooming in a new role : that of fascinating woman-about-town . Throughout the scene that follows , she puts on a great show of knowingness , self-assurance and conscious attractiveness , patronizing Frank in a way that would quickly exasperate him if it were not for the seriousness of the situation and the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the door to meet her . Gandersheim nods to her curtly and pretends to busy himself at the other end of the room , then reclines on the window-seat , with his back against the wall opposite the audience , examining manuscripts . p. 100 FRANK I hope you 've got your copy with you ! JUDITH I have n't quite finished it yet . I was going to type it out now . FRANK You better get to work right away . It ought to go out by the one o'clock messenger . But before you do anything else , please find out what 's wrong in the kitchen . We got a rotten breakfast this morning , and I 'm not sure we 're going to get any lunch . JUDITH I 've seen Bertha . She says you 've been barking at her . FRANK Of course I 've been barking at her . She brought me coffee that was stone cold . JUDITH She says that you made a long telephone call after it was brought in . FRANK It was cold when it first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving us breakfast at all . JUDITH You ca n't expect her to revel in it if you 're so disagreeable to her . FRANK If you were here , that would n't happen  --  and if you 're going to stay away , you might at least get your copy in on time ! JUDITH I wanted to wait for the opening of the Only Yesterday Club  --  and it turned out to be the only one that was interesting . They sang old surrealist songs from the Lean Thirties that I could sometimes just remember from my childhood . It 's incredible how they liked to talk gibberish then  --  it was evidently an outlet for them : " Oh , Mairzy Doats and Dozy DoatsAnd little Lamzy Divy "  --  p. 101 FRANK ( interrupting ) . I 've just received an interesting specimen of a different variety of gibberish . Read that . He hands her the letter and watches her while she reads it , not without a certain satisfaction , since he expects her to be upset . JUDITH ( handing it back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were you , I 'd stop the series . FRANK You 'd have me just lay down and take it ? JUDITH If my guess is right about what this is . The next article 's Luke Teniakis , is n't it ? FRANK One of the least offensive . JUDITH That 's where you 're wrong . Teniakis is the biggest shot of all . FRANK Teniakis is a smart young Greek , but he is n't a big shot ! JUDITH Yes , he is . You just do n't know about it . FRANK What do you mean ? JUDITH It 'll take quite a lot of explaining . ( She sits down on the farther side of the table toward the left , and lights a cigarette . ) But you certainly ought to know . FRANK Go on . He sits down opposite her , toward the right . p. 102 JUDITH Well , I suppose you 've got it in your article how he fought in the Liberation movement that was trying to give Greece a new deal and that was put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUDITH Well , as a result of that , he lost faith in the Allied pretentions , but at the same time he was too independent to want to work for the Reds . He came over here to America and set up his Mediterranean Relief Bureau to feed and find jobs for political refugees and politically-minded D.P. 's  --  but he soon learned American political methods  --  the kind that do n't have anything to do with philosophies or general principles  --  and he rapidly built up a machine that controlled an immense number of jobs in all kinds of businesses and institutions  --   --  FRANK I know all that , too . JUDITH What you evidently do n't know , though , is that the Teniakis organization is now the biggest thing in the country . All the other movements are past their prime , they 've been getting corrupt and porous , and Teniakis has been able to permeate them  --   --  FRANK ( resentful at being told all this by Judith ) . Permeate them with what ? JUDITH Why , just with Teniakisites . He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups in order to get his people placed ; but with his brain for intrigue  --  in his way , he 's brilliant  --  he gradually brought pressure to bear on them to give his clients more and more power . He 's got his key-men in the pressure groups and in every department of the government . It was Luke Teniakis who arranged the truce between the anti-Constitutionalist groups and made it possible for them to win the election , and to all intents and purposes it 's Teniakis who 's now in the White House . p. 103 FRANK And why has nobody had any inkling of this ? JUDITH You have n't had any inkling of it , because you hide yourself away out here and do n't have any idea of what 's going on . I began hearing about it before I 'd been in New York a week . But there has n't been anything in the papers , because Teniakis does n't want publicity . He wants to be known as just the head of a relief bureau . That 's why he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a damn smart idea : a movement with no publicity ! JUDITH The age of propaganda is finished . The old groups have been making more noise just because they 're losing their grip . They know that they 've got nothing more to offer . FRANK But what 's the idea behind this movement ? JUDITH There is n't any idea . You liberals always imagine that there has to be an idea behind things . What was the idea behind Genghis Khan or Alexander the Great ? The old groups have n't got any real ideas . The Reds have n't believed in their Communism since sometime in the early thirties . The so-called faith of the Children of Peter is something that no decently educated person  --  with the exception of a few panicky poets  --  has been able to take seriously since the seventeenth century . And as for the Yankee Elitists , with all their talk about the Founding Fathers  --  if even John Adams turned up today , they 'd denounce him as a dangerous demagogue. p. 104 FRANK I have n't heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JUDITH Well , your irony is out of place . I 'm simply trying to tell you the score . It may be rather hard for you to grasp it , but you know you 've always said yourself that all any of them wanted was power , and what Teniakis has been doing is simply concentrating on power without bothering about ideas or policies . He says he had enough of ideologies when he saw how the Greek politicians sat around in cafes talking while the fighters were put in jail . But he believes in free speech  --   --  FRANK So long as nobody mentions him . JUDITH Yes : the British left the press free in Greece , and he saw that if people were at liberty to discuss their problems in print , they were less likely to make real trouble . He says that  --   --  FRANK You 've met him ? JUDITH Just once . FRANK What kind of a guy is he ? JUDITH He 's a quiet little man  --  well-dressed . You would n't be likely to notice him unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does is so definite  --   --  FRANK He made an impression on you ? p. 105 JUDITH Yes  --  in a way , yes . He 's so perfectly matter-of-fact . The point is that he gives people permanent jobs  --  which is , after all , what they most want . They 've been over-drugged with lurid lies . FRANK No inspirational hokum , eh ? JUDITH All they seem to have is their slogan  --  that 's been passed around by word of mouth , but that 's supposed to have never been printed : Rule by the Uncommon Man in the Interest of the Common Man . From the moment that anybody whatever  --  no matter how mediocre his abilities are  --  holds one of Teniakis ' jobs , he has the status of Uncommon Man and is entitled to regard other people as common men . They say , though , that , as a matter of fact , there 's a pretty high level of ability among the Teniakis appointees . FRANK That has a familiar sound . JUDITH It 's different from fascism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is n't patriotic . FRANK You ca n't tell me he does it all without any kind of personal cult ! JUDITH Well , they sometimes call him the greatest Greek since Pericles  --  but he does n't encourage that . FRANK And you think I ought to knuckle under to the greatest Greek since Spyros Skouras without even putting up a fight ? p. 106 JUDITH I do n't see what else you can do . FRANK Hell , I ca n't refuse a challenge like that ! If what you 're telling me 's true , it 's the greatest story of all time . Not to break it would be journalistic suicide . JUDITH If you try to break it now , it 'll be actual suicide . FRANK Why should they go to such lengths ? JUDITH Right now is the critical time . If the rank and file of the Peters and the Reds and all the rest of the ideological groups were to find out that their top leaders did n't take the groups ' doctrines seriously but were really Teniakisites , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to set off the bomb ! JUDITH It would mean putting an end to my articles , but of course you do n't care about that ! There 's no other magazine that I could write in the way I do in Spotlight , but you never consider me ! FRANK Well , I 'm not going to suspend publication , and I do n't want to get murdered . But there 's a high wall around this place , and there 's no reason I ca n't barricade myself . I 'll take it up at once with the Chief of Police . JUDITH He may be one of Teniakis ' men . p. 107 FRANK Out here ? JUDITH Why not ? He has them everywhere . FRANK I can always get people I trust . JUDITH You 've made Bertha so sore at you now that I would n't trust her not to betray you . FRANK She 's all right : I 'll charm her again . JUDITH Your charm ! Do you think you can depend on it ? FRANK Yes . And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring out the window , now suddenly jumps up from the window-seat and speaks in great excitement . GANDERSHEIM The gardener !  --  here he comes now . Listen , Frank : I see the whole thing ! I 've really been expecting all this  --  I 've had the sense of it ever since I came here . Teniakis is the Monster God , and he 's been lurking here all the time . He 's here with us in the shape of the gardener ! He 's coming to us from over there ! ( Pointing at the window ) Look : the landscape has changed ! FRANK ( going over to the window ) . What do you mean , it 's changed ? GANDERSHEIM Those horrible little houses !  --  that 's where he 's got his own people . They 'll creep in on us from there  --  they 'll close in on us ! p. 108 FRANK That 's just a real estate development  --  it 's been there all along . GANDERSHEIM I 'm sure I 've never seen it before . JUDITH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't see it on account of the trees . It 's just that the leaves have fallen . GANDERSHEIM But look at that old man !  --  do you see him ? He 's coming across the fields from there , and there 's something unheimlich about him . Have n't you noticed how strange he is ? JUDITH I do think he 's a little bit odd , but he 's not really one of your goblins . GANDERSHEIM One ca n't tell who or what he is  --  even his nationality . I thought he was an Italian at first , and he certainly talked Italian  --  but then , when I spoke to him later , he seemed to have an Irish brogue . FRANK I , noticed that , too . GANDERSHEIM He spoke to me here one day in the queerest , most impudent way , and somehow he got me to talk to him about all kinds of personal things . JUDITH He 's been impudent with me , too . GANDERSHEIM It 's Shidnats  --  Shidnats is real ? When spoke about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . He meant that he controlled the switch ! p. 109 FRANK He might be a Teniakis agent . ( To Gandersheim ) Go down and get him in , Gandy . He 's on his way to the stable . GANDERSHEIM There 's something wrong with the stable : all those pigeons dying ! FRANK Take it easy : you ought to be writing that story instead of acting it out . GANDERSHEIM You think I 'm crazy , I know , but I definitely feel he 's not human . I would n't venture into the stable with him . FRANK Just ask Bertha to ring for him and tell him I want to see him . GANDERSHEIM All right , Frank : I may be silly , but you ought to be careful with him ! He goes out , controlling his agitation . JUDITH ( when Gandersheim has left ) . I do n't see how you can have him around . FRANK I could n't do without him now . JUDITH Do n't you think it 's rather alarming to have him fly off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and he 's been thinking about his next story .  --  Tell me : who put you in touch with the Teniakis organization ? Where did you get your information ? p. 110 JUDITH I got it from several sources . FRANK If you 've met Teniakis himself , you must know some of his agents . JUDITH Pinky who runs Pinky 's Place is one of his principal henchmen . FRANK You must have known him pretty well for him to tell you all that . JUDITH I do know him pretty well . FRANK I knew that those nightlife articles were just a pretext to go on the loose ! JUDITH It seems to me I 've done pretty well by you . If I had n't been getting around , you would n't have known a thing . You did n't even realize that Percy Gilman was the Teniakis man on our staff . FRANK What harm did Percy do us ? JUDITH He was using you as a screen when he went to kill that Cardinal . FRANK I do n't believe he had anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and Keenan 's secretary were both Teniakis ' agents . Teniakis had the Cardinal killed because Keenan had gotten on to the fact that the Bureau was infiltrating the Church , and had been putting up a very tough fight . FRANK How was the murder worked ? p. 111 JUDITH It was the flashlight . It 's a new lethal weapon . GANDERSHEIM An electrocution device ? JUDITH Yes , but it 's a product of brain research . It 's something entirely new . Up to a few years ago , it seems , the brain research people had only been able to study cats and dogs or patients under anesthetics who were having brain operations . But lately , in some jail in Europe that was crammed with political prisoners , they began just exposing their brains and testing pain reactions . They 'd found out how to use the emotions to generate electric charges , and they went the Nazis one better . Instead of just making soap and lampshades out of human fat and skin , they amused themselves by rigging up the cells with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their purely subjective feelings . They 'd threaten them or disappoint them , and the apparatus would do the rest . The principle of it is something like radar . FRANK What did they do ?  --  get the Cardinal overexcited ? JUDITH Yes : the gun only works for emotions like hatred and fear and grief . They have n't got the hang of the pleasant ones , and the unpleasant feelings are the only kind that they always know how to produce The secretary set the gun , and Percy Gilman made the Cardinal furious by accusing the Church of corruption . Then he left him , and the gun went off . p. 112 FRANK It seems unnecessarily complicated . JUDITH Well , the man who made it just loves gadgets and he 's an incorrigible practical joker . It was invented by a Teniakis guerrilla , who 'd been in jail and had seen those experiments . It does have the advantage that the killer does n't have to be there at all , and that when people find the apparatus , they do n't understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Gardener , who is this time without his hat and looks sober and dignified . FRANK ( to the Gardener ) . Oh , come on in.  --  Well , how are you getting along ? The Gardener advances in front of the table and , as Frank resumes the highbacked chair , he turns a chair around to face him and sits down near the other end . Judith takes a seat behind the table , between the Gardener and Frank , leaving a chair between Frank and herself . Gandersheim remains in the background . THE GARDENER ( with a Scotch accent ) . Weel enough . FRANK The work is too heavy for you alone . THE GARDENER Ah 'm no owerwirket : Ah dinna complain . FRANK You ought to have somebody to help you , and I 've got to get somebody to drive the car , now that Mrs. Brock is so much in town . I thought you might have a friend who could qualify . p. 113 THE GARDENER Ah 've no monny acquentances aboot here . FRANK How did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it through an employment agency ? THE GARDENER Ah 've never subjected mysel ' to the indeegnity o ' the auction block . FRANK You simply turned up here , huh ? How did you know we needed a gardener ? THE GARDENER Ah 'd heard that ye 'd moved in here , and Ah cam ' on the offchance . Ah 'm condemned to such places noo . JUDITH ( sharply ) . What kind of places do you mean ? THE GARDENER Lonesome places wi ' folk like you . GANDERSHEIM But why are you condemned to such places ? THE GARDENER Ah canna leeve in the great cities noo  --  and it seems that Ah 've still monny mair years to sairve . GANDERSHEIM How old are you , may one ask ? THE GARDENER How auld would ye think ? GANDERSHEIM Why  --  I 'd say in your late sixties . THE GARDENER You 'd be a long way short o ' the mark . FRANK This is getting away from the subject . ( To the Gardener ) Do you happen to know anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairsonal experience . Ah 've heard of it . FRANK You 're a naturalized citizen , I take it . THE GARDENER Ay . FRANK What is your nationality ? THE GARDENER Technically speaking , Ah 'm just an American  --  if that 's a nationality . GANDERSHEIM ( coming over to Frank and speaking in a low voice ) . He 's got a Scotch accent now . ( He sits down in the chair between Judith and Frank . ) FRANK Sometimes you sound like an Italian  --  sometimes you sound like an Irishman  --  right now you 've got a burr like a Scotchman . THE GARDENER Ah 'd leeved for conseederable periods in a variety o ' deefferent countries before Ah cam ' to the United States , and noo that Ah 'm auld , Ah meex them up . FRANK Where were you born ?  --  in Europe ? THE GARDENER Eh , mon , Ah hardly ken . ' T was somewhere near the Mediterranean , but Ah canna te ' ye where . Mah faither was an eeteenirant cobbler , an ' mah family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've heard about the Teniakis Bureau . Would it be a good place , do you think , to get a reliable man ? p. 115 THE GARDENER Ah 'm sairtain that anyone they sent ye would be verra unreliable for you . FRANK Why ? THE GARDENER Wi ' your cendependent magazine and your ambeetion to stick by your preenciples , they 'll do ye whatever meeschief they 're able . FRANK What do you mean ? THE GARDENER Eh , ye maun ken what Ah mean , seence ye 've ca'ed me in here to question me . FRANK How do you come to know so much about it ? THE GARDENER Ah 've a special knack o ' kennin ' such matters . FRANK That 's what I thought .  --  Listen here : you might just as well tell me right now  --  because otherwise I 'll find out for myself : What kind of an agent are you ? THE GARDENER Ah 'm not an agent in your sense o ' the worrd . If Ah 'm an agent , Ah 'm God 's agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you the agent of ? THE GARDENER Not your God , Meester Gandersheim  --  for he 's nothing more nor less than the auld Presbyterian Devil  --  ye got them meexed up in your childhood . In this country , ye began with the Puritan God  --  the hateful auld jealous Jehovah that folk had read about in the Bible . Ah believed in him once mysel ' , but later Ah cam ' to tak ' account that ye need not make God a tyrant to maintain a streect regard for your duties . An ' when God is a hanging judge , wi ' the Devil to ply the gallows , there 's like to be hardly a pin to choose between the judge and his hangman . Tak ' my word for it : the fear of a cruel God will mak ' ye as cruel as the God ye fear . p. 116 GANDERSHEIM Please mind your own business ! THE GARDENER Dinna fash yersel '  --   --  FRANK ( to the Gardener ) . Never mind : I did n't get you in here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice about hiring another man . THE GARDENER Ah 'll help you , sir , in any way Ah can . Ye can count on my loyalty at a ' times , if that 's what ye want to make sure of . FRANK I can , eh ? ( He looks at him searchingly , impressed by his tone of sincerity . ) THE GARDENER Ay , why should ye not ? Ah 'm on the same side o ' the struggle as you . FRANK What struggle ? THE GARDENER Ay , what , indeed ! It 's no verra easy to say . We can hardly talk noo aboot Recht an ' Wrong , for it 's that that 's made our hanging judges , an ' put the whole world at their maircy , till there 's been nothing but hanging judges wi ' no releegion behind them . FRANK What the hell ? have n't we got to believe that the things we want to do are right ? I hope you think that this tough Greek is wrong ! THE GARDENER Ay , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious o ' representing forces that Teniakis doesna ken , and that we hope he 's meescalculated and that what we represent will prevail . p. 117 FRANK What forces do you mean exactly ? THE GARDENER Why , the forces alive in this house . The godlike imagination that recreates life through art  --  Meester Gandersheim has his share of it , though the quality is puir today  --  and the weell to comprehend and to speak the truth  --  deteriorated though that is  --  that ye 've tried to poot across in Spotlight . JUDITH I suppose I do n't contribute anything ! THE GARDENER You 've something to contreebute , if ye will . You 've the spirit of a fighter , if ye 'd fight for a cause , instead of just wi ' eendividuals . ' T was women like you that won the vote and that took your sex out of the keetchen to use their brains for themselves  --  but today you 'll neither carry children nor carry the banner of freedom . JUDITH I am free . THE GARDENER Free for how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the wairld enslaved ? JUDITH ( to Frank ) . You see what a self-righteous old bore he is ? FRANK After all , we more or less asked for it . ( To the Gardener ) All right : thank you . THE GARDENER Dinna distrust me  --  dinna be feared to call on me . Ye might care to know Ah 've never yet died  --  so , presumably , Ah canna be keelled . He goes out . They watch him to the door . p. 118 GANDERSHEIM ( still rather nervous ) . What did he mean by that ? JUDITH He 's obviously cracked . FRANK I do n't know . JUDITH He 's most obnoxious , in any case . FRANK He may be some kind of religious fanatic , but I do n't see that he 's necessarily crazier than anybody else out here . Gandy has got us surrounded with the demons of Shidnats Slyme ! You come and tell me I 'm caught in the toils of a super-dictatorship that 's super-secret and super-sly , so that it 's hopeless even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a product of your imagination ? JUDITH Thank you for your opinion of my judgment ! You see that your friend the gardener knows about Teniakis . In the meantime , you 're confronted with that letter . FRANK I 'm going to give it to the police right away . JUDITH If I were you , I 'd hold out that article . FRANK I hate like hell to yield to threats ! There 's something in what the old man says : we 've got to hope we 're stronger than they are . JUDITH But in this case we 're definitely not  --  and you 're putting me in danger , too . They might kidnap me and hold me as a hostage . p. 119 FRANK Yes : you better stay down here . JUDITH And both of us get killed together ? FRANK Well , I ca n't just weakly submit . You 've never wanted me to in the past . JUDITH It 's never been a case of life or death . FRANK Or of your brilliant journalistic activities . JUDITH It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it a question of my vanity when I 'm actually in serious danger ! FRANK Well !  --  ( He picks out the article from the pile and throws it on the table . ) I wo n't send it down by this messenger . I 'll hold it out for the present and take the matter under consideration . ( He picks up the manuscripts . ) But do n't tell me later on that I have n't got any guts . She makes no reply . He hurries out . GANDERSHEIM ( to Judith , with bitterness ) . You want to destroy his manhood ! JUDITH That 's something you 'd sympathize with , is n't it ? ( She lights a cigarette . ) GANDERSHEIM I certainly sympathize with Frank for everything you 've been trying to do to him  --  to humiliate him and break down his confidence . p. 120 JUDITH Do you want him to be actually killed ? GANDERSHEIM ( agitatedly getting together his manuscripts ) . I 've got my own suspicions about all this ! JUDITH What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know so much  --  and you 're a friend of Teniakis it seems . JUDITH I suppose you think you 're going to tell Frank that I 'm in on the conspiracy to shut him up . If you do , I 'll tell Frank a few things about you that I heard at the Punchinello Club . GANDERSHEIM ( getting up from the table , with his papers ) . Frank is a very broadminded and understanding person ! JUDITH His broadmindedness has limitations . GANDERSHEIM ( escaping from the room ) . Well , we 'll see who wins out ! She looks after him with a malevolent smile. @x The workroom in the late afternoon of the day before Christmas . On the window-seat is a " gift-wrapped " Christmas package . On the table , a tray with a bottle of Scotch , a bowl of cracked ice , highball glasses and a bottle of soda-water . Frank has pulled out the morris-chair so that it stands in front of the table on the right , and he is sitting in it , reading what looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is growing darker , and he has turned on one of the student-lamps . He looks up quickly and apprehensively , as he hears a step on the stairs , then stands up , drops the leaflet on the table and covers it with some other papers and , putting his right hand in the pocket of his coat , points a revolver through the pocket toward the door , at which he gazes impassively but intently . Judith comes in . She is now cultivating a different style , that of intriguing femme fatale : pale and handsome , hair done up on the top of her head , eyebrows completely plucked and false ones drawn on as supercilious arches , a close-fitting dark suit . She carries in her left hand , her arm dropped down at her side , a Christmas wreath tied with a large red ribbon . FRANK Hello . JUDITH Hello . FRANK I did n't expect you . JUDITH I said I was coming for Christmas . p. 122 FRANK It 's a week since I 've heard anything from you . JUDITH I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could come . FRANK I have n't done anything about Christmas dinner . JUDITH I thought you were going to ask the What's-Their-Names and those other people for tomorrow afternoon . She goes over to the mantelpiece and sets the wreath up in front of the clock . FRANK I had n't heard anything from you . JUDITH I told you I was coming . FRANK ( watching her with the wreath ) . That 's cockeyed . Get the ribbon on the bottom . JUDITH Why not at the top ? FRANK Well , get it in the middle , anyway ! ( She arranges it with the bow at the bottom . ) That still is n't straight . JUDITH ( turning around and coming over to get a cigarette from the table ) . You ca n't make it stand straight if you have the bow underneath . FRANK The What's-Their-Names have asked us to their house for dinner tomorrow night . JUDITH I have to go back tomorrow night . I 'm going to dinner in town . p. 123 FRANK I told them I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of fact , did you think it was worth while to come at all ? JUDITH It was n't if you 're going to behave like this . FRANK This is a hell of a merry Christmas ! If I 'd known you were n't going to take it seriously , I 'd have arranged to spend it with Francie . JUDITH Why did n't you ? FRANK You left it up in the air . You said you 'd call me , then never did , and I 've had enough of calling you and being told , that you 're not there . Do you realize that you 've succeeded in preventing me from seeing my own daughter on Christmas Day every Christmas for the last three years ? JUDITH I told you I 'd be glad to have her here . FRANK The Christmas she spent with us was a nightmare ! JUDITH I 'll go right back to town ! FRANK Sit down and have a drink , now that you 're here . She goes over and stands in front of the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pours in a dose of whiskey . FRANK You do n't Like soda-water , but I did n't know you were coming . p. 124 JUDITH This is a delightful reception . You have n't even got a fire in the fireplace . FRANK ( moving toward the door ) . I 'll get Bertha to bring some regular water . JUDITH Never mind : I 'll drink it straight . FRANK Sure you want it that way ? JUDITH It 's all right . He hands it to her and pours a drink for himself . FRANK The truth is you ca n't take Christmas . It always gets you down  --   --  JUDITH No , it does n't . FRANK I do n't think you 've ever gotten over those perfectly grisly Christmases that you used to spend at your aunt 's after your parents died  --  when you had to go to church in East Orange , and you said that about the only present you got was the popcorn they gave you in Sunday School . JUDITH You never hesitate to remind me of the unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind me of them yourself  --  but by all means let 's forget about them . ( Going over to the window-seat ) I got you a present . I hope you 'll like it , because it 's something you said you wanted . p. 125 JUDITH ( looking toward the package , her childish curiosity and greediness rising to the bait ) . What is it ? ( As he brings it over to her , resuming her former attitude ) You should n't give me a present : I did n't expect you to . FRANK Why not ? JUDITH Our relations have deteriorated so . ( She unties the ribbon , opens the box and takes out the object inside . ) FRANK Not fundamentally , perhaps . JUDITH ( unwrapping a large jewelled comb of the kind that is supposed to be worn in Spain ) . It 's too big : I 'd look ridiculous . FRANK It 's just exactly what you said you wanted . JUDITH It 's too flashy for my present style . FRANK Those are real emeralds . JUDITH Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JUDITH You should have kept it till tomorrow morning . This is only Christmas Eve . FRANK ( giving up ) . Well , you ca n't win : it 's hopeless ! It 's what I told you  --  though you do n't like to hear it : when you were little you never had a decent Christmas  --  so you always have to be disappointed ! p. 126 JUDITH It 's just that , under the circumstances , I do n't like to have you giving me presents . She lays the comb back in the box and puts it on the table . FRANK But why , for God 's sake ?  --  What circumstances ? JUDITH Oh , you know . FRANK You mean you 've been cheating on me ? JUDITH What you agreed to when I went to New York was really a separation . FRANK That was n't my understanding !  --  Well , who 's the boy-friend : Ellis ? JUDITH I do n't see Ellis any more . FRANK ( snatching at this ) . I could n't imagine you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , as if to herself ) . He has his points , though . FRANK ( losing his temper ) . Oh , what the hell do I care ? Sleep with a different man every night ! You do n't need to come out here at all ! You 'd better keep away from me , anyway , if you want to go to any more night-clubs . JUDITH Is that a threat ? FRANK No , it 's not a threat : it 's a statement of the simple truth ! I 'm just about to break the story on Luke Teniakis. p. 127 JUDITH Right away ? FRANK Yes . JUDITH In the next number ? FRANK January 14 . JUDITH You have n't advertised it , have you ? FRANK Of course not . It is n't even listed in the contents . JUDITH I think you 're crazy . He wo n't let it get on the stands . FRANK He wo n't find out about it . JUDITH He must have a spy at the press . FRANK It has n't been set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ? FRANK I 've set it up out here with my own hands . I learned typesetting as a kid , you know , and I got hold of an old hand-press that they were keeping as a curiosity in the local newspaper office . I bought it and set it up here in the stable . I 've printed the article myself , and I 'm going to drive into town with it , and Gandy and I are going to work all night putting the pages in every copy . JUDITH He 'll stop it right away on the newsstands . FRANK He wo n't be able to do anything about it before a lot of people have seen it . It will have gone out to all the subscribers . p. 128 JUDITH And how will you dodge the rap ? FRANK ( exalted by desperation and by the stimulus of his drink ) . I 'll go up to town and live at the Plaza  --   --  JUDITH You better not take a room too high up ! FRANK  --  I 'll damn well make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , and I 'll just wait for the blow to fall  --  if they 've really got the nerve to kill me . I 'll go to nightclubs and shows every night  --  and I 'm going to get a girl to go with me who 'll say thank-you for Christmas presents ! If they get me , maybe somebody will write on my tomb : He died for American journalism ! JUDITH How did you get your facts ? FRANK That I 'm not telling anybody . But there 's a damsight more dissatisfaction with Teniakis and his conspiratorial methods than you seem to realize . JUDITH It 'll be the end of my articles ! Even if Spotlight goes on , they 'd never let me into the night-clubs . Half the nightlife in New York now is controlled by Teniakis . Gandersheim enters . GANDERSHEIM ( to Judith , with perceptible condescension ) . Oh hello ! ( To Frank ) The printers are on the phone . p. 129 FRANK ( nervous ) . What do they want ? GANDERSHEIM I do n't know : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gandersheim walks over to Frank 's end of the table and starts checking up on the papers to make sure that nothing dangerous has been left there . GANDERSHEIM ( to Judith ) . It 's nice that you could get out . We were n't certain you were coming . JUDITH ( observing his anxiety ) . Do n't worry about the article : Frank 's just told me about it . GANDERSHEIM Oh ? ( Looking up at her ) We 're in your hands , then . JUDITH Do n't worry . GANDERSHEIM I 'm not . ( Attempting to propitiate her ) You 'll look stunning with that Spanish comb . JUDITH Poor Frank ! He has no taste about such things . She goes over and takes it out of the box , examining it again , to find out whether it is really expensive , and wondering whether she can wear it . Gandersheim , hearing the back-gate click , looks nervously out the window , sees something that arrests his attention and leans across the window-seat . p. 130 JUDITH What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghoul 's Row ? GANDERSHEIM It 's Ellis . JUDITH No ! ( She comes over quickly , with the comb in her hand , and looks out at Gandersheim 's right . ) Please do n't tell him I 'm here : I do n't want to see him ! GANDERSHEIM Frank will tell him . JUDITH Well , you need n't . She goes out hastily , still carrying the comb , to shut herself up in her bedroom . Gandersheim looks after her a moment , then , coming in front of the table , moves toward the middle of the room . GANDERSHEIM ( soliloquizing ) . She 's played him some dirty trick  --  or maybe he 's found her out . He would n't be able to stand for her long . Such a nice clean good-looking young chap !  --  he had such a fine sense of decency that he would n't go on working for Frank when he was having a love-affair with her . That 's something that 's so very rare nowadays : an old-fashioned sense of honor ! Our good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ! Old Dr. Parkes at Morning Prayers and the poetry he used to read : Say not the struggle naught availeth ; Play up , play up and play the game ! ; Amici usque ad aras : one always knows where one is with a person from one 's own background . I had a moment of terror just now when I thought it was some stranger coming  --  but , thank goodness , it 's only Ellis . I hope he 's not still after Judy ! If it 's his loyalty to Frank that has brought him back , what a help he could be to us now ! Ellis appears at the door , immediately followed by Frank . Ellis has left his hat downstairs but has brought up his briefcase with him . Frank leaves the door partway open . p. 131 ELLIS Hello , Gandersheim . Gandersheim , smiling , shakes hands . GANDERSHEIM It seemed so delightfully natural to see you coming through the back-gate with your briefcase ! ELLIS ( to Frank ) . This is n't really a social call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Sit down . What 's on your mind ? He sits down at the head of the table , and Ellis takes one of the chairs on the side that is nearer the audience , standing his briefcase on the table in front of him . ELLIS I 'd like to talk to you alone , if you do n't mind . FRANK Gandy sits in on all my conferences . ELLIS I 'd rather see you entirely alone . FRANK That would have been all right when you were confidential secretary here  --  but now you 're just a complainer or a favor-asker , like any other visitor .  --  Which are you ? ELLIS Both . FRANK Shoot Gandersheim retires to the window-seat . ELLIS First of all , I 'll have to explain that I 'm representing an organization that I do n't think you knew I was connected with : the Luke Teniakis Relief Bureau . p. 132 FRANK I wondered what you were doing . ELLIS What I came to see you about is the article on the Bureau that you 're planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've cancelled it . ELLIS I mean the other article  --  the one you want to bring out in this issue . ( He unfastens the briefcase , opens it and takes out a copy of the insert , leaving the briefcase , open , on the table . ) FRANK There is n't any other article . ELLIS ( grinning ) . I mean the one you set up in the stable  --  this one . ( Holding it up ) FRANK I 've been seriously disappointed in you , Ellis , but I did n't expect to see you turn spy ! ELLIS ( smiling ) . I 'm not in the Intelligence Department . Have n't you been rather furtive yourself ? FRANK There 's nothing in the laws of the United States that says a man ca n't set up his own newspaper ! ELLIS We think that a public-spirited citizen wo n't want to do anything on his own account that 's not in the public interest . p. 133 FRANK Who the hell is " we " ? Who says what is or is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more right to judge that than any racketeering delicatessen-dealer . ELLIS There 's no racketeering in the Bureau . Teniakis is strict about that . The main thing , however , is that we want you to hold out the article . FRANK If I wo n't , what does your ( ironical ) organization propose to do about it ? ELLIS What we propose to do is to explain the situation more fully , in the hope that you 'll see it our way . FRANK ( turning around toward Gandersheim ) . I 'll be damned : he 's coming out here to high-pressure me ! ELLIS I knew you were going to say that , Frank  --  but this is not the same thing at all as the propaganda groups who 've been after you . What we 're after is n't publicity but for the press to take no notice at all of us , so that Luke can go quietly on building up the essential services . And seriously , Frank , I can tell you that the Relief Bureau is getting things done . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say . FRANK I seem to have heard that before . I suppose you 'll be telling me next that the Long Island Railroad is running on time ! p. 134 ELLIS So it is . Did n't you know ?  --  But there 's one thing that 's running damn badly , and it 's something that we 'd like to get your help with . FRANK Now comes the bribe ! Go on : I 'm fascinated ! ELLIS The fact is the matter came up before anybody knew about your article . The situation is that Dopesheet  --  you know Dopesheet , the racing journal  --  has got into an awful mess . McGonegal is resigning . FRANK Why ? ELLIS I wo n't go into that now . FRANK I see ! ELLIS Well , the paper is n't exactly , of course , on the very highest level of journalism , but it 's always been a little more than just a racing sheet . It 's always stood up for the Common Man  --   --  FRANK And encouraged him to throw away his money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of this ! ELLIS It has real possibilities , Frank  --  and Luke himself has had the idea that you 'd be just the man to remake it  --  ( As Frank seems about , to explode ) Do n't answer till you 've thought about it . It 's more interesting than you  --   --  FRANK Listen , Ellis : what interests me is to know how a guy like you who 's been brought up as a perfect gentleman can be hypnotized into falling for this mug . I 'm not exactly surprised , because you ca n't be surprised by anything nowadays  --   --  p. 135 GANDERSHEIM I am : I 'm absolutely shocked ! FRANK  --  But I feel a certain curiosity as to precisely how the feat was accomplished . GANDERSHEIM The man is an illiterate gangster ! ELLIS We call him the greatest Greek since Pericles and the greatest American since Andrew Jackson . FRANK Why Andrew Jackson , for goodness ' sake ? Judith appears in the doorway and stands listening behind the door . ELLIS Jackson was an early example of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interests of the Common Man . GANDERSHEIM What would Dr. Parkes have said if he 'd heard you compare Teniakis with Pericles ? ELLIS Something very stuffy , no doubt . You have an exaggerated respect for St. Matthew 's , Gandersheim  --  perhaps because you did n't finish there . If you 'd been through the whole mill as I was , with Princeton and Oxford on top of it , it would n't have very much glamor for you . I do n't doubt that those places meant something in the fairly remote past , when they trained what were known as " the better people . " Even as late as my father 's day , it was possible to cherish the illusion that there still existed a world in which social distinction and scholarship and the practice of the more serious professions had some kind of real importance . But by the time I went to St. Matthew 's , the headmaster was merely a money-raiser who had memorized a few lines from Wordsworth , and the fathers of most of the boys were nothing much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rich but who 'd been driven to desperation by the Government 's inroads into business . When the parents  --  who were invariably divorced  --  came up to see the boys for weekends , they were usually as jumpy as Mexican beans from having had to skip an evening 's drinking . p. 136 GANDERSHEIM There is still such a thing as a gentleman ! ELLIS Where ? There 's no class of gentlemen now that counts . The ideal of public service that was a part of the upper-class tradition is only kept alive today by the fruitdealer Teniakis , who was trained in the Greek Resistance  --  and if somebody like me who 's been trained in those obsolete schools of conformity can help to make Luke 's contacts smoother by a little St. Matthew 's suavity , I 'll consider that my education has not been entirely wasted . ( To Frank ) Does that answer your question ? FRANK It answers my question , old bean , with a frankness I 'd hardly expected . And now I 'm going to ask you another : What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be won by your suavity ? ELLIS I 'll answer that question frankly , too : the article wo n't be distributed . FRANK ( springing up from his chair ) . By God , they ca n't prevent me from talking , if it 's the last thing I ever do ! ELLIS Do n't kid yourself , Frank  --  and do n't do anything foolish . I 've come as a friend , believe it or  --   --  FRANK I anticipated something like this , and I know what to do about it . Go back and tell that smart Greek louse who 's taken you on as " an errand-boy that your mission was completely fruitless . Judith comes in from behind the door , but walks around the end of the table , so as to pass on the opposite side from Ellis . p. 137 ELLIS Do n't you think that your language is rather strong for the weakness of your position ? We 've taken our precautions , too  --   --  JUDITH Hello , Ellis : what an exciting surprise ! Is this a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but greeting her rather stiffly ) . Hello : I did n't know you were here . He shakes hands with her across the table , and while this is going on , Judith , with her free left hand , quickly picks up the unfastened briefcase and , stepping back from the table and holding the briefcase away to the right , pulls out of it a large flashlight . ELLIS ( rising and putting out his hand ) . Please do n't fool with that : it 's broken . She whisks it away and darts over between Frank and the window-seat . ELLIS ( moving toward her end of the table ) . Look out : it may give you a shock ! JUDITH ( to Frank ) . Do n't let him get it back  --  it 's the thing they kill people with ! Frank pulls out his revolver and , stepping behind the table , stops Ellis at about half-way its length . Gandersheim has jumped to his feet and stands behind Frank . Judith gets as far away as possible , at the extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ellis . p. 138 ELLIS Do n't be silly ! It 's just a broken flashlight . JUDITH I know what it is ! ( To Frank ) This is the thing I told you about  --  the thing that they used to kill Keenan . ELLIS You 'd better leave it alone ! JUDITH Nonsense : I know how it works . It is n't even set to go off .  --  Well , a fine knight-in-armor you turned out to be ! ELLIS I did n't know you were out here . You were supposed to be in town today . JUDITH So you came here to kill Frank ! ELLIS I came out to try to prevent it . FRANK Had n't we better get rid of it right away ? JUDITH It ca n't go off now . FRANK ( to Gandersheim ) . See if the gardener 's still out there . GANDERSHEIM ( looking out the window ) . Yes . FRANK Call him in . Gandersheim knocks on the glass and gestures to the Gardener to come up . FRANK ( to Judith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know so much about it ? p. 139 JUDITH Somebody explained it to me . FRANK Who did ? JUDITH I would n't want to tell . ELLIS We know , though . JUDITH No , you do n't . Frank , still covering Ellis , opens with his left hand a drawer in the end of the table and takes out another revolver . ELLIS If you care about saving your friend , you 'd better give back that gun . You know I could n't use it now , even if I wanted to . She shoots him an ironical look . FRANK ( to Ellis ) . Well , this is a hot one ! I send you up to town as a tried and trusted henchman to investigate a murder and you come back with the murderer 's weapon , all ready to roast me to a cinder ! ELLIS I 'm sorry , Frank : I was trying to save you . They 'd have simply bumped you off before now if I had n't volunteered to come out here . FRANK You did n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I did n't want them to do any of the other things . The Gardener enters . FRANK That was darling of you !  --  ( Addressing the Gardener ) Mr. Ellis , I 'm sorry to say , is no longer in sympathy with us . He 's come back here as an agent of the gang we want to expose . p. 140 THE GARDENER ( crossing himself ) . Bozhe moy ! FRANK He came here to kill me , in fact . ( Holding out the revolver , but not turning away from Ellis ) Take this and stand by the door . Shoot him in the leg if he tries to rush us . THE GARDENER ( coming forward ) . Please forgive , little father . I can only help to fight with words . It is forbidden me to fight with weapons . FRANK Do you mean it 's against your religion ? THE GARDENER Yes , gracious little father . FRANK Good God , he 's gone Russian on us now !  --  All right . ( Handing the gun to Gandersheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gandersheim complies , passing in front of the table . ) Keep an eye on the door , too . GANDERSHEIM I will , Frank . He comes forward so that he can see into the hallway . JUDITH ( to Frank ) . They must have thought you were an easy victim . Ellis told them how bad-tempered you were , and he came out to get you worked up and then leave you to storm and fume and eventually set off the gun . p. 141 THE GARDENER ( crossing himself again ) . Spasi , Gospodi , i pomilui ! FRANK ( to Ellis ) . Offering me the editorship of Dopesheet , huh ? ELLIS I 'd like to say that Judith 's point of view on this is a very much distorted one . FRANK Distorting your behavior , Ellis , is the same as painting the lily . But the problem is what to do about you . ( Indicating the morris-chair ) Why do n't you sit down while we talk about it ? ( Ellis complies . ) Do n't you want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while on duty , eh ? JUDITH ( to Frank ) . I do n't think you ought to hesitate to shoot him  --  if we could be sure of getting rid of the body . FRANK Let 's not resort to their methods . ( To Ellis ) How would you like to give me your word of honor that you 'd get out of the country and stay ? JUDITH ( sneering ) . Ellis has n't any honor  --  his word is n't worth a thing ! He 'll even lie out of a dinner engagement . p. 142 ELLIS I 'm sorry about that evening : I really did have to dine with my aunt  --  and I resent being told that my word is no good . FRANK Will you swear , if I let you go , that you 'll clear out and say nothing ? You wo n't want to face them after this failure . I 'll supply the money . GANDERSHEIM Do n't let him go , Frank : it 's Shidnats ! FRANK Oh , lay off that , Gandy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun toward the window ) , just as I knew he would ! It 's not the real Ellis  --  how could it be ? It 's Shidnats in Ellis 's body . They 've murdered the real Ellis ! JUDITH ( coming over to Gandersheim ) . You 'd better give me that gun . GANDERSHEIM Please leave me alone ! FRANK Listen , Gandy : I admit that this sounds like one of your Stories , but we 've got to face an actual crisis . There 's nobody to watch the stable . Will you go down there and check ? If you 've got a good incantation , it might be helpful to get it off . GANDERSHEIM Do n't make fun of me , Frank ! FRANK Give Judy the gun and go out and see if things are all right . p. 143 GANDERSHEIM Whatever you say , Frank . Judith takes the revolver from him , transferring the flashlight to her left hand . Gandersheim , chagrined , goes out , closing the door behind him . FRANK ( to Judith ) . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still covering Ellis , and puts the flashlight on the mantel , the bulb-end facing the stage . JUDITH The idea of thinking that Ellis is any different now than he ever was ! She returns and takes up her stand between Ellis and the door . FRANK What gets me is how he kept acting as though he were so goddam scrupulous . ELLIS You were urging me to get rid of my scruples when you wanted to find out about Keenan  --  and , given your objective , you were perfectly right . FRANK I did n't want you to commit any murders ! What beats me is how you made the jump from being a minister 's son to the role of professional killer ! ELLIS As I told you , you 're quite mistaken . My idea in coming out here  --   --  THE GARDENER ( interrupting ) . Forgive me , please  --  but if you will permit me , I understand this very well . I can perhaps explain better than he can . I was once assassin , too . In the old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Neegeelest conspiracy that assassinated Alexander Second  --   --  p. 144 FRANK Well , that was legitimate , was n't it ? The old regime in Russia was rotten . THE GARDENER From political point of view , we thought we were doing right thing . But later I come to look at the matter from point of view of God , and I know then that we committed mortal sin . I did not throw bombs myself , but I was there when my comrades threw them . First bomb killed only Cossacks  --  but it was horrible to see even Cossacks die . Then the Tsar got down from his carriage to find out if anybody hurt , and I see that he is thin and old , that he is tired and sick and has many worries , that he drives in his own carriage like a prisoner , that the autocrat is less free than we . For the first time , all of a sudden , I see that he is a man and I pity him . Not only he is always in danger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second bomb is thrown  --  it explodes and tears off both his legs , and they carry him away to die in terrible unspeakable suffering . I was student of natural science , then  --  I was rebel against Christian God , but I could not forget the face of Alexander Nikolevich . Not very long after , I read the writings of Lyov Tolsty , and I understand all our sin . I see clearly that through hatred and violence one can never cure any evil  --  such methods only make more evil . Through love , and only through love , can evil be turned away . p. 145 ELLIS ( clearing his throat , a little embarrassed ) . What I 'm trying to explain is that I do n't hate Frank . He may think I resented him when I worked here , but actually I 've always liked him , and  --   --  THE GARDENER You are convinced that world will be better off if you murder a man you like ? ELLIS The world will be better off if it 's decently run for once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about all the millions of people who were killed in the last two wars ? If another such war can be stopped by a few quick and painless executions , we certainly ought n't to hesitate . ' FRANK How can you stop a war ? ELLIS The Relief Bureau is international : we 've got people all over the world . THE GARDENER It is against law of God to kill in war , and it is equally against law of God to kill for political reasons . ELLIS We prefer to say administrative . FRANK You 're quibbling . THE GARDENER It is not important what you call it . All violent acts are crimes : they are offences against Christian teaching . ELLIS Do n't think I have n't thought about this . As Frank says , I 'm a minister 's son . But my father had a fashionable Episcopal church and was a passionate Anglo-phile , and it was brought home to me very strongly by the time I was ten years old and we were fighting the Japs and the Germans that what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian church . p. 146 THE GARDENER It is true that the churches preach war , but that is not precept of Christ . ELLIS No , but really  --  aside from the churches  --  you can find non-resistance in the Gospels , but you can also find the other thing . One of my father 's most successful sermons was based on the text from Matthew , I came not to send peace , but a sword . That was during the first World War , and he had the congregation so excited that , after the service was over , the women stood out on the church steps and pinned white feathers on all the men who had n't enlisted yet . What 's the point of pretending we 're Christians , and that Christianity means brotherly love ? It 's much better , it seems to me , to do such killing as we need without rancor . The way we regard it at the Bureau : it 's just a clearing of the ground to build . JUDITH You 've got your own cliches now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Judy , for reasons that are completely irrelevant and due to a misunderstanding . JUDITH It would be interesting to hear your story ! ELLIS I 'd be glad to tell you , if you 'd let me . JUDITH Look , Frank : you 're not getting anywhere . This is no time to argue theology . You can see that I really know something about the Teniakis business , and I think it might be more useful if I could talk with Ellis alone . p. 147 FRANK What light would that throw on your problem ? JUDITH I ca n't explain now , but I swear to you it 's really important . FRANK It 's not important to me if Ellis stood you up on a date . JUDITH It 's not that . Do leave us alone for just a few minutes . You can stand right outside in the hall . It 's the only way I can help you . FRANK All right , but make it quick . I ca n't afford to waste much time . ( As he is walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mantel . ) I 'll put this away somewhere . JUDITH No , leave it : it 's safer here  --  because I know how it works . It 's not set , and even when it is , there 's a device that lets you know when it 's going off . The flashlight bulb lights up and keeps burning for several minutes before the gun fires itself . That 's how the killer knows when to leave , if he 's had to stay in the room . FRANK I do n't want you bumping off Ellis ! JUDITH I wo n't  --  I promise . FRANK All right  --  better keep between him and the door ! JUDITH Do n't worry . FRANK O.K.  --  ( To the Gardener ) Come along . p. 148 THE GARDENER I obey , little father . Frank goes out . THE GARDENER ( following Frank , but turning and addressing the audience  --  he speaks now with a Jewish accent ) . I have n't had a scene like this since Gorki 's The Lower Depths  --  and the translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELLIS What I wanted to explain to you , first of all , is that I did have to go to my aunt 's . JUDITH Do you expect her to leave you money ? ELLIS No  --  but she 's my father 's only living sister , and a formidable old lady . She does n't invite you often , and when she does , you have to go . JUDITH In other words , one of your aunts would always have a priority over me . ELLIS That 's not the way I 'd put it . I  --   --  JUDITH ( interrupting him ) . I resent your whole attitude toward me . You went to the most elaborate trouble not to have me meet your Southampton friends that night . ELLIS I thought they 'd bore you to death . All they talk about is business and beaches . p. 149 JUDITH I thought he looked rather sweet . ELLIS ( grinning ) . It may have been an instinct on my part not to have you meet somebody that looked rather sweet to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLIS Do n't you think I 've got some cause for complaint ? JUDITH No . ELLIS You would n't even let me talk to you on the phone . And how about Pinky Papadopoulos ? JUDITH I do n't really like him . He 's too Levantine . ELLIS He must have been pretty crazy about you to have told you about his gun . JUDITH That 's what I wanted to talk about . I do n't want him to get into trouble . I want you to promise me absolutely that you wo n't give Pinky away . ELLIS Otherwise , what ?  --  you 'll shoot me ? JUDITH No : I do n't want to shoot you . ELLIS Why should I promise , then ? JUDITH Because I want you to . ELLIS I hope it 's not really finished between us. p. 150 JUDITH I did n't want it to be . ELLIS Shall I see you again ? JUDITH If you want to . ELLIS You know I do . It was really your letting me down that made my join Teniakis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terrifically upset . After all , I 'd only seen you twice  --  and I had n't ever known before what that kind of thing  --  what love could be like . JUDITH It was exciting in that sordid little room up above the Tokyo Club , was n't it ? I did n't tell you then , but that 's the room the professional tarts use . ELLIS Yes : it transfigures everything , does n't it ? I could n't get down to earth afterwards . I could n't bear to go on as I 'd been doing , just being a polite young man and doing research for their articles . JUDITH Did you actually take the oath and give them the guarantee ? ELLIS Yes . JUDITH What crime did they make you commit ? ELLIS You 're not allowed to tell .  --  I was desperate : I wanted to be hard , like you . JUDITH I 'm sorry . I 'll try to make it up to you . p. 151 ELLIS Will you really ? JUDITH The third time is always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you this time ? She comes over and , sitting on the right arm of his chair , still holding the revolver in her hand , she puts her right arm around his neck and leans over and gives him a long kiss . JUDITH ( lifting her head ) . Does that convince you ? ELLIS Yes . JUDITH You wo n't tell about Pinky ? ELLIS No . JUDITH I 'm really with you people , you know . ELLIS Are you really ? You did n't act so just now . JUDITH That was just because I was sore at you . ELLIS Really ? JUDITH Of course  --  but I 'm not any more : it 's very much the other way . ELLIS What about my mission , though ? JUDITH Frank , you mean ? ELLIS Yes . JUDITH That might come out all right . p. 152 ELLIS You think you can make him see it our way ? JUDITH Not in his present mood . ELLIS What will you do , then ? JUDITH If necessary , I 'll have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell him you 'll disappear . Give him your word of honor . ELLIS I do n't quite like to do that . JUDITH Oh , come : we 've had to change our ideas about human relations , have n't we ?  --  since that day when you were saying to Frank that these movements put a premium on treachery . ELLIS ( suspicious of irony and giving her a doubtful glance ) . Of course : an impersonal relation can be something much more sacred and binding . JUDITH So go back and tell your headquarters that everything 's been taken care of . ELLIS Can I depend on you ? I noticed just now that your instinct was to rush to Frank 's protection . JUDITH Not really  --  it was just to get back at you . ELLIS What night , then ? JUDITH Let 's say the end of the week . With what 's likely to happen here , I probably wo n't be free till Saturday . p. 153 ELLIS You mean  --  Frank ? JUDITH Yes .  --  Let 's say Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She moves away toward the door . ) ELLIS You wo n't shoot me if I get up from this chair ? JUDITH What do you want to do ? ELLIS ( coming over to her , as she stops in front of the fire-place ) . I just want to tell you this ! ( He embraces her with his right arm and gives her a long kiss on the mouth , while with his left arm , without her seeing , he reaches to the mantelpiece and pushes a catch on the flashlight ; then he relinquishes her , murmuring in a low lover 's voice : ) Till Saturday  --  do n't let me down ! JUDITH ( with a lover 's look ) . All right .  --  Go back over there . He returns to the morris-chair . Judith walks to the door , while Ellis looks after her with a crooked smile . JUDITH ( opening the door ) . Come in . Frank appears , with the Gardener , who hangs behind . JUDITH ( to Frank ) . He 's going back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That will give you time to get away . It would n't do to hold him here : they 'd be right out to see what was wrong . He 's given his word of honor that he wo n't let them know the real situation . Now , do n't ask me how I did it  --  but I 've got something on Teniakis.  --  Here , take this . ( She gives him the revolver and hurries out the door. ) p. 154 FRANK ( looking at Ellis intently ) . Do you agree to that ? ELLIS Yes . FRANK All right : be on your way ! ( To the Gardener ) See him off the place . ( To Ellis , as the latter stands up ) I 'm not even going to follow you with a gun . You 've given me your word , and I trust you . ELLIS This does n't mean , Frank , you know , that you 'll be free to distribute your article . I wish you 'd come around and discuss it . Teniakis himself will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view  --  you 've written about him exactly as if he were just an old-fashioned boss . FRANK The old-time political bosses contented themselves with stuffing the ballot  --  and sometimes having somebody beaten up . They did n't kidnap and murder people . And everybody knew who they were . ELLIS There never was a human society that did n't depend on force . We shoot our traitors and spies . FRANK Only in time of war  --  and the people gave our government that power . Who 's appointed Teniakis to be judge and executioner ? ELLIS The people are finding it pays to put things in the Bureau 's hands . They 're conceding  --   --  p. 155 FRANK Well , here 's one person who is n't ! ( The bulb of the flashlight lights up with a sharp but unobtrusive blue light . ) Now , go on !  --  ( Turning to the Gardener , which gives Ellis a chance to glance toward the flashlight ) See him out by the back and lock the gate . I 'll watch from the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with the Gardener , the Gardener shutting the door . Frank puts the revolver on the table and stands thinking , his hands on his hips . Judith enters . She is very pale . She is wearing the Spanish comb and carrying a small Christmas package , done up with a rosette of ribbon . JUDITH You 'd better get away somewhere , Frank . FRANK ( turning around ) . Get away ? For God 's sake , I 've been prepared for this ! I 've got a plane on call out here ; and I 'm going to fly over Manhattan and as many other places as my leaflets last and bomb them with the truth about Teniakis . JUDITH You 're not ! FRANK I certainly am !  --  and maybe you 'd better come along . JUDITH They 'll get you as soon as you land . p. 156 FRANK I 'm going to land in Canada , where they 've only got Commonwealth Socialism .  --  ( Grinning ) You look wonderful with that comb . JUDITH I like it . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I brought you a little present . FRANK No ! You do n't mean to say ! ( He takes it and unties the ribbon . ) I thought you were done with Christmas . JUDITH I would n't let Christmas go by without giving you a present . He unrolls a gray cloth , on which are fastened a variety of enormous gold-plated tie-clips in the shape of daggers , swords and arrows . The flashlight bulb goes out . FRANK Tie-clips , by God ! JUDITH You were complaining you could n't find them anywhere . FRANK A completely new model , by gracious ! What is this ? A dagger ?  --  an arrow  --  a sword ! ( He detaches the dagger and clips it on his tie . ) I 'm delighted !  --  I never feel right without one , and I have n't had a decent one for years . Baby darling ! ( He kisses her . ) This makes me feel a lot better about meeting my Maker , if I 've got to . I 'll at least be correctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , do n't you ? FRANK ( with a light touch ) . There are moments when my faith in you wavers . JUDITH But I am  --  I almost always am !  --  Oh , everything 's so horrible , is n't it ? You ca n't live with it ! Let 's go to Canada ! I ca n't stand it any longer ! I hate those night-clubs and places : they cheapen you  --  it 's all so dirty ! They tried to make me talk about Spotlight  --  but I would n't tell them a thing . FRANK You must have gone pretty far with somebody to get all that information . JUDITH ( beginning to cry ) . Oh , do n't !  --  do n't reproach me : I ca n't stand it !  --  I 've always been loyal to you , really . That snobby little punk Ellis !  --  now that he 's gone bad , he 's more of a prig than ever . ( Sobbing and gasping ) You know how I bought him off ? I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd set the flashlight for you . ( She begins , to laugh and choke hysterically . The flashlight bulb goes on . ) Oh , do n't look so hurt ! Do n't ! ( As he gazes at her surprised , with a touch of alarm )  --  I ca n't bear to have you look hurt ! I know that I 've treated you rottenly , but I 'll try to make up for it now . I 'll go up in the plane with you  --  it 's terribly exciting . You 're the only one who 's really got guts ! ( She throws herself against him , clinging with her hands to his shoulders . He puts his arms around her . ) That 'll be a surprise for Ellis ! ( She laughs uncontrollably again. )  --  I hope they asphyxiate him , the way they do with their hopeless incompetents ! p. 158 FRANK By God , today is my greatest day !  --  the day of desperation and glory ! There are times when the whole turn against tyranny depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you 're back with me ! You 're back to stay ? JUDITH ( between sobs ) . If you want me . FRANK ( pulling her to him ) . You 've always been my real strength !  --  I do n't fear man , devil nor delicatessen-dealer !  --  ( He brings out his handkerchief and wipes her eyes . ) Now , take it easy , puss . JUDITH I feel terribly about what I 've done to you ! FRANK Today you 've wiped everything out !  --  Now , get yourself in hand : we 've got to get going . The flashlight bulb fades off . JUDITH I 'm ready . FRANK You 'll have to pack some things for Canada . I 'll go get Gandy . Meet me downstairs . JUDITH You 're not going to take him ? FRANK I was going to . You do n't object , do you ? JUDITH ( like a sulky tearful child ) . Yes . p. 159 FRANK I do n't like to leave him here alone . JUDITH If he goes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but never mind . Now go on  --  we 've got to hurry . JUDITH And I might as well say right now that if I 'm going to come back with you again , you 've got to get rid of Gandy . FRANK ( making for the door ) . All right , all right ! We 'll talk about that later . The door opens , and Gandersheim enters . GANDERSHEIM I came up to see what your plans were . The gardener 's down there on watch . FRANK We 'll have to go ahead with Plan Two . But Judith 's going to fly with me , so you need n't come . We 'll need the room in the plane for the leaflets .  --  But you 'd better find some place to hide out that nobody but me will know .  --  I 'm going to call the pilot now . ( To Judith ) Meet me down below ! Frank hurries out . Gandersheim stands stunned , then casts a hateful look at Judith . During the conversation that follows , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , collecting important things that she thinks they should take in the plane . p. 160 GANDERSHEIM It 's nervy of you to go with Frank , but are you quite sure you want to be identified with what he 's trying to do ? JUDITH Frank and I always work together . GANDERSHEIM That 's news ! JUDITH You 'd better think about getting away . If you stay around here , they may kidnap you . If I were you , I 'd go to Mexico . GANDERSHEIM I would n't desert Frank ! JUDITH He ca n't have you here any more . GANDERSHEIM What do you mean ? JUDITH He wo n't need you any more , because I 'm coming back here to work with him . GANDERSHEIM Does that come from Frank ? JUDITH Yes . GANDERSHEIM I hope you wo n't mind if I say that I do n't necessarily believe it ! JUDITH Ask him . GANDERSHEIM You 've made him do this ! JUDITH Yes , I have . GANDERSHEIM You bitch ! The bulb lights up . JUDITH Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . p. 161 GANDERSHEIM It makes you a bitch . JUDITH It 'll be enough for Frank , when he knows how you talk to me in my own house ! GANDERSHEIM Your own house ! It 's my house , please  --  and I 've let you play utter hob with it ! Transplanting my hydrangeas and all the rest ! JUDITH Do n't give yourself away so . GANDERSHEIM I 'm sick of your insinuations ! JUDITH It 's soobvious they 're sexual symbols . GANDERSHEIM They obviously are to you . You ca n't bear to have those handsome flowers flourishing in front of the house , just because you want to castrate the men ! You 've done your best to ruin Frank , to kill his faith in himself  --  just because you ca n't bear to see men succeed . You made up to Ellis in the first place just out of perversity and vanity  --  you 're incapable of loving anyone  --  I 'm sure you 've never even had a single moment of genuine physical passion ! And the result was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had n't been for me at that time , he might never have got through this " crisis  --  and now you 're coming between us ! JUDITH If it had n't been for me , he 'd never have known about Teniakis. p. 162 GANDERSHEIM ( getting more and more furious ) . I wo n't have it. ! I wo n't permit it ! Frank Brock is the finest person that I 've ever known in my life , and you want to spoil our friendship  --  when you 've never done anything yourself that was n't destructive and hateful ! JUDITH It takes one of you sissies , does n't it , to be really nasty to a woman ! GANDERSHEIM A woman ! What kind of a woman are you ? I thought you did n't want to be a woman . You wo n't condescend to have children  --  you do n't even care to have a husband , except for an occasional meal-ticket and to amuse yourself by torturing him on rainy days . You want to compete with the men , yet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horrid yowl you set up when anybody tries to slap you down ! The relation between Frank and me is absolutely staunch and true : we have confidence in one another , and that confidence is never betrayed . JUDITH But Frank does n't want you , he wants me . GANDERSHEIM But you really do n't want him  --  you just want to feel you can make him squirm  --  to titillate your own little ego ! JUDITH Now , stop that !  --  I wo n't stand for it , I tell you ! p. 163 GANDERSHEIM You know what you are ?  --  you 're Shidnats Slyme ! You 're not a woman at all ! You 're neither a man nor a woman ! JUDITH That 's an amusing accusation from you . GANDERSHEIM I never thought he 'd come in skirts , and that 's why I did n't recognize him  --  but that 's what 's so horrible , I see it now  --  that 's what 's short-circuiting the world : the woman that wo n't be a woman , the woman that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thwarter , not a letter-down  --  but it was part of the same thing : she would n't let my father travel , she would n't send me back to school . And what good is a woman , for pity 's sake , if she does n't want to make men ? ! JUDITH A woman ca n't make a man if he has n't got the makings of a man . GANDERSHEIM I was a man today all right when I had this gun in my hand ( he picks the revolver up from the table ) , when Frank and I were standing up to Teniakis ! JUDITH No , you were n't . Put that down ! GANDERSHEIM You 're frightened of a man with a gun !  --  well , that 's symbolical , too . JUDITH ( showing signs of becoming hysterical ) , Put it down !  --  put that gun away ! p. 164 GANDERSHEIM Your father and mother , eh ? JUDITH Do n't dare to talk about that ! GANDERSHEIM I 'm afraid it gives me great satisfaction to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper hand of a woman ! If my father had frightened my mother the way I 'm frightening you , I might have had the life that I longed for . Maybe that was the way that your father felt when he shot his wife and himself ! JUDITH ( shrieking before Gandersheim has finished ) . Help !  --  oh , Frank , help ! GANDERSHEIM All right : I 'll put it away . ( He replaces the revolver on the table . ) You 'd better pull yourself together if you 're going to go up in that plane . She stares at him ; her mouth open , her brows contracted , in a tragic childish mask of terror . Frank comes running in . The Gardener appears behind him , but does not come far beyond . the door . FRANK ( putting his arm around Judith ) . What 's the matter ? what 's going on ? JUDITH He was threatening me ! GANDERSHEIM That is n't true . JUDITH He was threatening me with the gun ! p. 165 GANDERSHEIM I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for God 's sake do n't have one of your fits  --  if you do , I ca n't take you with me  --  and we ought to leave  --  it 's almost eight . ( He looks at the clock on the mantel. )  --  My God , that thing 's lit up ! They all look up at the flashlight . GANDERSHEIM The little blue light !  --  that 's it ! Shidnats is behind that , too ! Frank quickly takes the flashlight down . JUDITH ( completely unstrung but trying to concentrate ) . Wait a minute  --  I know how it works . ( She fumbles at it with shaking hands . ) There 's a button , but it 's not the one that looks like a flashlight button  --   --  Frank takes hold of the flashlight . GANDERSHEIM ( in a panic ) . I did this ! He 's in me now  --  he 's taken possession of me ! JUDITH Make him get out  --  he 'll set it off ! FRANK Better throw it out the window . GANDERSHEIM ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're setting it off yourself ! A blaze of blue livid light , exploded from the mantelpiece , illuminates the whole room . We see Gandersheim , Frank and Judith , for a moment , with their mouths gaping open . Then Gandersheim falls back on the table , and Frank and Judith collapse in front of the fireplace . Then the flare fades out , with the other lights , leaving the stage in darkness . The Gardener , his figure irradiated against an opaque black background , is revealed at the front of the stage , in the center and facing the audience . He is standing erect now , with an austere Hebraic head thrown back . He speaks with the accent and the somber tones of a tragedy in the Jewish theater. p. 166 THE GARDENER Like Apollo in the house of Admetus , I must depart at the advent of death  --  I , Ahasuerus , the doomed rabbi , the Wandering Jew . In many different countries , in many different tongues , I have played your stage gardener , your moralist . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not influence the action ? What use to play commentator merely in a world I can no longer guide ? We , the Children of Israel , gave you the God of the Old Testament , and you judged and punished like him . We gave you the God of the New Testament , and you tried to forgive and love . We gave you the Social Revolution , and you tried to judge the men of the present and to love the men of the future . But I who mocked at our prophet Christ , who told him to walk faster as he carried the cross and who therefore was sentenced to wander till Christ should return again  --  I have lived through two thousand years to see all these moralities fail . Even Israel has forgotten its prophets  --  for , goaded by the outrage and cruelty of the people of heathen lands who have rejected the laws of God , we have claimed our own land again and defended it against violence with violence . No one can reproach us now for our helplessness , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regained , I no longer have any place . I can not learn to be a patriot in Palestine . And , in your country , who will receive me ?  --  who will recognize the sign of God ? who will fight at the command of the spirit ?  --  who will even serve the vision of Justice that has gleamed for our secular leaders ? For you , God and spirit and vision are fading with the words that name them . What you trust in , for all your techniques , for all your mechanisms of industry and politics , is merely the brute vitality that animates the universe  --  and our own people , dwelling among you , are exchanging their traditional disciplines for the new one of electronics . So now you must make your new rules , develop your new calculations . They are based on statistical averages , and I can not help you there , for my gospel has all been derived from the conscience , the courage , the insight , by which men of a chosen race asserted their superior authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? My friends are few and weak  --  I have hardly even self-declared enemies to do honor to God 's agent by hating him . ( The light on him begins to dim but leaves his face illumined . ) Why must I wander still ? Was Jesus deceived ?  --  will He not come again ? Am I already half a wraith that flickers for a moment still in your terrorized darkness of soul when you are tortured or tempted by the forces that are pressing you into alien shapes ? Is the star of Bethlehem setting , on this night of the Holy Nativity , as the little blue light of hate ? No : even in this black night of blasphemy I can not yet die or rest : I must go on to new unbelievers . God 's hand still directs and drives me  --  though perhaps to the last precipice-edge above which mankind must falter . God has created the Light , and the Light will not wholly fail  --  I shall bear it , though the Heavens be darkened , to show where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with you  --  somewhere , at some man 's side ! The light on his face goes out .
