The more he thought about the Kentucky Derby , the more Veteran Jockey Eddie Arcaro was embarrassed by the memory of Calumet 's Iron Liege finishing so far in front of him . " It was my fault , " decided Eddie . " I should n't have held Bold Ruler back ; I should n't have run his race for him . " So when Wheatley Stable 's dark bay colt went to the post at Pimlico for the 81st running of the Preakness , Eddie went along just for the ride . He let Bold Ruler break for the lead , thought nothing of scrapping with sprint star Federal Hill all down the backstretch , worried only when his mount began to loaf after leading the pack past the turn for home . When Iron Liege made his move , Eddie took to the whip , and Bold Ruler went back to work . He was still pulling away when he won by two lengths . Behind him , outclassed Iron Liege had all he could do to keep a neck in front of outsider Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . He ran the way he wanted to . " <P> &lt;J Competing for the last time as a high-school student , Jim Brewer , 18 , of Phoenix , Ariz , made the most of his springy new Fiberglas vaulting pole , pushed himself over the bar at 15 ft. 1 in . Trying for 15 ft. 1 in. , Brewer knocked down not only the bar but both standards as well , quit for the afternoon , satisfied with his record as the first U.S. schoolboy ever to pole vault 15 ft . <P> The Big Red crew from Cornell stuck with Yale 's Olympic champions all the way down the Olympic course ( 2,000 me ters ) on Princeton 's choppy Carnegie Lake . But Yale 's two feet of lead seemed too much for the Big Red to erase . Then , ten strokes from the finish , Cornell 's all-senior eight found strength for a final spurt . Their shell slid across the line inches in front to win the heavyweight sprint championships of the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges . <P> A total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 205-mile Grand Prix of Monaco . Only four laps later Britain 's Stirling Moss , Peter Collins and Mike Hawthorn somehow escaped uninjured from a three-car pile-up on a barricade of telephone poles . All afternoon the accidents continued , but no one was hurt . Only five cars finished . Still , World Champion Juan Fangio had to push his Maserati to the limit to cross the line in 3 hr. 10 min. 12.8 sec. , a scant half-minute ahead of Briton Tony Brooks 's Vanwall.
