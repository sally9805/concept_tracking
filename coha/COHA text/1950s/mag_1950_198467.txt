Chlorophyll , the complex substance that puts the green in grass , has been used for years to take cooking smells out of the kitchen . Occasionally it has been used to make putrefying wounds less obnoxious to patients and nurses . But until 1945 nobody thought of using it to make healthy people smell sweeter , inside &; out . Nothing was farther from the mind of Dr. F. ( for Franklin ) Howard Westcott , a New York City internist , when he started giving chlorophyll to his patients . <P> Dr. Westcott was trying to find a cure for certain types of anemia . He noted that the odors of vitamin B and of asparagus , usually noticeable in the urine , were greatly decreased when his patients were taking chlorophyll-A ( one of the two major chlorophyll fractions ) . This gave him the idea that chlorophyll might work in the body , through metabolic processes , to deodorize bad breath and perspiration . <P> After the Bath . First he used a doctor and four nurses as human guinea pigs . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurer ) on each other 24 hours after they had taken baths . Sure enough , they found that underarm odor was cut in half , or even abolished , for as long as 18 hours after a dose of chlorophyll . The results were confirmed in experiments with a group of twelve college girls . <P> Dr. Westcott found that onions present a tricky problem because particles get stuck in the teeth and release volatile oils for hours afterwards . When his college girls took onion juice , which left no particles , chlorophyll greatly reduced the breath odor and sometimes abolished it . The only effective treatment for onion eaters , Dr. Westcott concluded , was to clean the mouth thoroughly and then use a chlorophyll mouthwash or suck a chlorophyll tablet . He found that ordinary bad breath , whether from food , drink , tobacco or an upset stomach , was easily controlled by chlorophyll . <P> Green Pills . Last week the De Pree Co. of Holland , Mich , offered a chlorophyll preparation over the counter , without prescription , under the trade name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 Paddy-green tablets ( a month 's supply ) . Nullo , the label emphasized , " does not stop perspiration . " But , claimed the makers , it " is effective in the control of . . . perspiration odors of the underarms and feet ; odors associated with menstruation ; and odors that may be the result of faulty metabolism . Nullo , allowed to dissolve on the tongue , quickly neutralizes localized mouth odors . " <P> It takes a couple of hours for chlorophyll to take effect , but then , the manufacturers claim , it gives relief in 90% of cases-even to basketball players . <P> Veterinarians have found that elderly dogs with bad breath or smelly hides can be turned into more pleasant companions with chlorophyll . One 100-mg. tablet is enough for the average man , but a dog needs six times as much-100 mg. for each 25 Ib. of body weight .
