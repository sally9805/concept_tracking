What kind of defense will the U.S. be able to buy with the approximately $36.5 billion left by the Eisenhower budget cut ? Deputy Secretary of Defense Roger Kyes. ex-General Motors vice president and production man ( see below ) , had cut carefully in all directions to get the $5 billion saving . Some of the probable results of Kyes 's budget cutting in terms of men and equipment : <P> Combined manpower strength of the armed services ( now 3,650,000 ) will be reduced in fiscal 1954 by 7.5% , i.e. , about 273,750 men . <P> The Army will keep the 20 combat divisions it now has and ( because of an additional $1 billion appropriation for ammunition ) may actually end up with more money than it expected to get under the Truman budget . Its training divisions , however , will be cut from ten to seven and its replacement training centers from 14 to 13 . <P> The Navy 's projected atomic aircraft carrier will have to use a cheaper power source than the $250 million breeder reactor called for in original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and funds to start a third will be available . Naval aviation funds will also be cut . <P> The Air Force goal of 143 wings by January 1956 will be reduced to 115 wings . Transport and tactical wings ( which furnish support to the Army ) will be skeletonized in order to keep Strategic Air Command and U.S. defense wings at present strength . <P> Obviously , the Air Force program will bear the brunt of the cuts , and it is in this area that the President has yet to fill in a few blanks . The Truman Administration 's plan to build the Air Force to 143 wings was not-as Eisenhower implied-a program which was to be ready for one critical year and then done with . It was a program to equip the U.S. with air weapons for the jet age , to be ready by Jan. i , 1956 . <P> Since , as far as the U.S. knows , the Soviet military threat is still unchanged , the Eisenhower Administration 's next move must be to assure the U.S. either 1 ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 2 ) that the Administration has found a more efficient way to meet it , or 3 ) that the projected 143-wing buildup was too big in the first place . <P> In this general area , the questions are sure to fly thick and fast when Roger Kyes takes his new budget to Congress next week .
