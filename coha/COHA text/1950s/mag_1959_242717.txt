Like a battalion deploying for battle , a crowd of nearly 1,000 surged through Manhattan 's Roosevelt Hotel last week as formal bargaining opened between the steel industry and the United Steelworkers Union . So numerous were the advisers , statisticians , supernumeraries and just plain hangers-on that the cost to management and labor was estimated at nearly $25,000 a day . President Eisenhower tried to set the tone for negotiations by warning again that both sides must show " good sense and some wisdom " to avoid an inflationary wage hike ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . But both sides had hardly started negotiating when they fell to battling . <P> The battle started with a statement by R. Conrad Cooper , chief negotiator for the steel industry , that the industry is considering a mutual-aid pact or even an industrywide shutdown should the union decide to strike one or two firms instead of striking the whole industry at once as in the past . Such a pact would be similar to the profit-sharing pact signed by struck airlines last fall ( TIME , Nov. 10 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil Aeronautics Board , which can exempt airlines from antitrust procedures . <P> From the union came a roar : " Conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws . " Union officials sent letters to Washington , asking the Justice Department to investigate the pact , the National Labor Relations Board to determine whether steel firms could act together on a shutout , since they do not bargain as a unit ( U.S. Steel acts as the front man for the industry ) . But legal experts saw no clear reason why the steel industry could not legally act together on a shutout to protect itself , and the NLRB turned down the union 's request because it had made no formal charges . <P> Alarmed by the uproar , Cooper backtracked , allowed that the industry never expected to use such a plan . Said he : " We have never locked out the Steelworkers , nor have we had to consider the problem . It has always been the union that has exercised the full force of its nationwide power to bring the entire industry to a halt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper had an answer for Steelworkers Union President David Mc Donald 's claim that a wage hike carved out of profits or dividends would add new purchasing power to the economy . The stockholders , said Cooper , need the money worse than the workers . He cited a 1953 survey which showed that 53% of U.S. Steel individual stockholders had an average annual income from all sources that was actually less than the average annual income of the Steelworkers . <P> At week 's end the advisers and supernumeraries departed , and a four-man team from both management and labor got ready to sit down this week to begin the serious bargaining that will result in a new contract-or a strike .
