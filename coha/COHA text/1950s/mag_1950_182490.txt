There was little of Flatbush left in the dark-eyed , glamour-bobbed brunette who called herself Yvette Madsen . Only a hint of Canarsie in her consonants , a touch of Gowanus in her vowels remained to mark her as plain Jane Noack , a kid born in Brooklyn 22 years ago . Yvette was glad enough to have left Jane behind . <P> One evening last October Yvette went to a cocktail party near Frankfurt with her husband , U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Andrew Madsen . They drank bourbon-and-Coke , played " Pass the Kleenex , " *and Yvette twitted her Georgia-born host , another U.S. officer , on his Dixie drawl . " O.K. , " responded the airman good-naturedly , " how do you say it in Brook-lynese ? " Sensitive Yvette slapped the joker full in the face and demanded that her husband take her home immediately . Andy Madsen , a Californian , was too busy laughing to pay much attention . He tossed her the keys to the family car , and Yvette stormed out alone . <P> " The Low Creature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . He was greeted by the blast of a .45 , died instantly with a bullet through his heart . When ( as she later testified ) Yvette " heard his blood " oozing from his chest , she ran to the home of a neighbor , screaming " I shot him ! " Soon afterward an Air Force MP found Andy 's body in the Madsen living room close by a note written by Yvette : " I know my husband will beat me up . My only defense is to shoot him , the heel , the rat , the low creature . " <P> Last week , before a three-judge U.S. district court in Frankfurt , Yvette stood trial for her husband 's murder . Their two children ( aged four and one ) had been sent back to Brooklyn to stay with Yvette 's mother . At Yvette 's side stood her father , plain-spoken Alfred Noack , who had given up his carpenter 's job to help defend his daughter . From spectators ' benches in the packed courtroom , Yvette 's neighbors , members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives self-marooned in a strange land , looked on . Some brought their knitting . Others came with detective magazines . The trial was a relief from endless bridge lunches and snack-bar gossip fests . Only now &; then did they pause to give the proceedings their full attention-on those three climactic moments , for instance , when Yvette , sobbing and hysterical , fainted dead away from the effects of a four-day hunger strike . <P> " Gee , she do n't look the type that would bump off her husband , does she ? " asked one of the wives leaving court to cook supper , as Carpenter Noack carried his daughter from the courtroom . " I do n't know about that , " answered another . " She looks screwy to me . " <P> " Hang Me ! Hang Me ! " Throughout the trial , Alfred Noack tried his best to promote the same argument in his daughter 's defense . " She 's absolutely insane , " he told newsmen . " She does n't want to go on living . " He brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brooklyn . " She was always high-strung when she was a girl , " wrote Mrs. Noack . " She had a lot of crying spells . She had tantrums . She acted like a nut . " At 15 , the girl had run away from home , had lived with a middle-aged merchant on Manhattan 's Park Avenue .
