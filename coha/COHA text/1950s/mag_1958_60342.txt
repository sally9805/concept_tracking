The San Francisco giants are optimistic , officially so . Mr. Chubby Feeney , the genial Dartmouther who handles much of the Giants ' front-office detail for his uncle Horace Stoneham , is the source of this intelligence . // Mr. Feeney sits in the bleachers out along the left field foul line in Phoenix Municipal Stadium , somewhat behind a long , handsome cigar and slightly under a flamboyant upswept straw hat of quasi-Mexican parentage . He gazes soulfully at the four dozen Giants and near-Giants disporting themselves on the playing field and with a note of sincerity lending a slight throb to his voice says , " I know this : we 'll finish ahead of the Dodgers. " // Mr. Feeney 's eyes are blue and , at times , innocent . At such times it is entirely possible to accept both the throb and the sincerity . The Giants to finish ahead of the Los Angeles Brooklyns ! Is it really so much to ask ? Chubby and his uncle ( and , they hope , the city of San Francisco ) will wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division for another year , if only this season , California 's debut in the majors , the Giants can beat out the Dodgers. // Feeney waves his cigar grandly and explains the simple basis of his optimism : the Dodgers are an old club , going down , whereas the Giants are a young club , coming up . // Young , Mr. Feeney ? The Giants ' spring training roster listed such as Bobby Thomson , Whitey Lockman , Don Mueller , Hank Sauer , Marv Grissom , Dusty Rhodes , Ray Katt , Ray Jablonski . Thomson started with the Giants in 1946 , Lockman in 1945 , Mueller in 1948 . Sauer is 39 years old this month ; Grissom , 40 . Rhodes has been trying now for six full seasons to blossom into a regular outfielder , without success . He and Katt and Jablonski are yesterday 's rookies of promise , now fading veterans in their 30s , still on the short side of success . // Age in itself is no tragedy , of course , nor is modest ability . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third successive sixth-place finish might rest to a sobering degree on these past-tense players . The Giants have a center fielder ( whose name escapes memory for the moment ) and a good shortstop , Daryl Spencer . They have a variety of athletes who can play second base without falling down . They have fair pitching . And they have a fine little second-string catcher in Valmy Thomas , the only Virgin Islander in the major leagues . // Beyond that , they have age . Mr. Feeney ? // Mr. Feeney is undaunted . He is a young man , as front-office people go , and his eye is on the young men in camp , the phalanx of youth , the raw , handsome rookies with the hot bats , sticky gloves and extravagant endorsements . These are children next to the oldtimers on the roster , but the Giants would love to go with these bright children . " Sixth place is n't very good , " says Chub Feeney . " We might as well gamble . " // The gamble is concentrated on four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inning of major league ball , and indeed only two of them are on the Giants ' major league roster at the moment . Yet all are good winter-book long shots to be in the starting lineup on April 15. // There are other youngsters around , some of them quite impressive , but attention in Phoenix constantly focuses down to these four : Bob Schmidt , a tall , rangy catcher who had the first-string job won last year before he injured himself ; Jim Davenport , a lean , wiry , unflamboyant third baseman who is everybody 's sleeper because he looks so much like a ballplayer ; Willie Kirkland , a left-handed-hitting outfielder who was plain awful early in training but whose pedigree ( 35 homers a year in the minors , 128 runs batted in ) is awfully good ; and , finally , Orlando Cepeda , a right-handed-hitting first baseman from Puerto Rico who is Item One in the Giants ' Category of Hope . // Cepeda is only 20 , but he has three full years of professional experience behind him , with successive minor-league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last made at 19 with Class AAA Minneapolis . He is powerfully built , agile and quick , a good first baseman , a hitter who cocks his bat far back and high up and wings it into a pitch . He runs well and slides with abandon . He is so young , so unproved , so impressive . // Memory cautions one to recall the absolutely marvelous young players the Giants have had in springs past . Surely you remember Johnny Rucker ? Or Clint Hartung ? Bill Ayers ? Or , for that matter , Andre Rodgers , who just last March was the greatest shortstop in the major leagues ? // Yet hope is part of the lifeblood of baseball . Going into a new town , a good town , a knowing town , it is far better for the Giants to gamble on hope than to cosy mediocrity close to the vest . // And , who knows , perhaps this blend of youth and age  --  coupled with the presence of the fair pitching and that center fielder ( Willie Mays , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sufficient depth , to turn them into a consistent , pleasing ball club . Perhaps even to the point  --  oh , rapture  --  of beating out that club from Los Angeles . // Mr. Feeney waves his cigar optimistically and agrees .
