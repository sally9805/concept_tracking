Juan Pern , who was swept into power by the votes of Argentina 's working-class descamisados , has endlessly proclaimed his devotion to organized labor . Less frequently , but no less earnestly , he has pledged himself to uphold the freedom of the press . Last week Juan Pern demonstrated just how much such promises are worth . For the first time in Argentine history , he used military law to crush a disobedient union . And he allowed two government-backed unions to shut down the country 's biggest and most respected newspaper , Buenos Aires ' independent , conservative daily , La Prensa . <P> " Wartime " Law . The rebellious union was composed of railroad workers on Buenos Aires ' suburban lines . Three times since November they have struck , demanding higher pay and freedom from meddling by Eva Peron 's all-powerful central trade union , the C.G.T. ; twice before , Pern and Evita managed to get them back on the job with soothing promises ( TIME , Dec. 25 ) . When the rail workers struck for the third time last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Evita herself made a dramatic tour of railroad stations , giving speeches . But an estimated 80,000 remained out . <P> Though the strike was no tougher on the public than others that had been officially tolerated or encouraged , there was one big difference : this was against the government , which now owns all the railroads . Accusing the strikers of being " Communists , anarchists , radicals and socialists , " Pern invoked the stiff 1948 " Law for Organization of the Nation in Wartime . " Three hundred union members were arrested for " violating the security of the state , " and almost 2,000 more were fired . The rest were mobilized under the Ministry of Transport and ordered back to their posts under pain of court-martial . <P> " Tendentious " Coverage . La Prensa , along with La Nacin , Buenos Aires ' other great independent paper , reported the strike accurately and completely . The Peronista press reacted with violent criticism of the two papers ' " tendentious " coverage of the dispute . That day the news-vendors ' union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Prensa unless the paper met a list of fantastic demands . The union insisted that La Prensa 1 ) close its branch circulation offices , 2 ) give up its subscription lists and let the dealers control its entire circulation , and 3 ) turn over 20% of the revenue from classified ads , the paper 's main source of income , for the union 's " social-assistance program . " <P> Although the demands were probably intended to be unacceptable , La Prensa said it was willing to take the matter to arbitration , and meanwhile printed a token edition . Next day the printers ' union , another C.G.T . affiliate , ordered its men out . La Prensa was silenced.
