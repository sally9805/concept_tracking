Quacks have always preyed on those who believe that banishing the malaise cures the malady . But to doctors nowadays , concerned with basic cause and cure , " mere relief of a symptom looks petty and the problem . . . seems a bore . " <P> So says Dr. Walter Modell of Cornell in The Relief of Symptoms ( W. B. Saunders Co . ) . The book 's point : doctors must try not only to find a long-range cure but to give immediate relief . Otherwise , patients may be driven to the charlatan . Author Modell lists symptoms that should be treated at once , whether or not the basic trouble can be cured . Samples : <P> Insomnia , one of the most common complaints , usually originates in the mind rather than the body . Occasional bouts can be treated with drugs ( which have become so popular that a woman patient debated : " I do n't know whether to take a Benzedrine and go to a party or take a Seconal and go to bed " ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological difficulties . Modell also suggests some nonmedical remedies : changing sleeping habits , eating before bedtime , swigging a nightcap , reading in bed . Counting sheep is not much help . <P> Gas in the intestines is perhaps the least polite symptom doctors have to deal with , and one for which , says Modell , there is no precise term now in decent usage . When , as commonly , it is caused by swallowing air , it is simply embarrassing . But it may also indicate loss of intestinal muscle tone , especially when vomiting or excessive belching results . In such cases it can usually be relieved by heat applications , enemas or drugs . <P> Difficulty in breathing ( dyspnea ) is one of the most disturbing symptoms , and may indicate serious disease , e.g. , asthma , pneumonia , congestive heart failure , anemia . Morphine provides quick relief , but may be dangerous . Other remedies , depending on the cause : adrenaline , blood transfusions , oxygen , removing obstructions from the windpipe.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
