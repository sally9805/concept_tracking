Three weeks ago , beset by the threats of strikes among Italy 's teachers and civil servants , Premier Antonio Segni passed out an average raise of 12% to every civil servant-an annual total of $425 million . Compared to Italy 's gross national product , this generous gesture was equivalent to raising the cost of government in the U.S. by $7 billion at one stroke . Everybody agrees that 1 ) Italian civil servants are underpaid , 2 ) Italy 's 1,000,000-man bureaucracy is inefficient , cumbersome . Segni , before raising the pay , had had parliamentary permission to change the system , but he let the power lapse without making any real reform . <P> Only one member of Segni 's administration . Treasury Minister Silvio Gava , was spoilsport enough to ask where the money was to come from . When he got no satisfactory answer to his question , Gava threatened to resign , and was only talked out of it with some difficulty . <P> Last week another member of the Segni Cabinet . Finance Minister Giulio Andreotti , assured the voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impossible prospect of paying for something with nothing . Treasurer Gava went to Premier Segni again . He was quitting , and this time he really meant it . <P> <P> As one step towards a healthier Italian economy , the Chamber of Deputies approved a bill ( already passed by the Senate ) allowing foreign businessmen to invest freely in " productive " enterprises in Italy , and to get that money out .
