He looked like a ' good time Charley ' to me . " I had another fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare outside a cocktail lounge . He did . The fare said his name was Steve . I told him I knew a friend who might be able to get him a date . " I got two metal suitcases out of the trunk of the other cab and put them in the trunk of my cab . I had a hard time getting both suitcases in the trunk and suggested I put one up front . But Steve said ' No . ' " We drove out to Sandy O'Day 's house she is now held in Kansas City as a material witness , picked up Sandy , went to a bar and had some drinks for which Steve paid with a $20 bill . He shoved the change , $18 , across the table to me and said , ' You take this . ' I said to myself , ' What a fare I 've got here . ' Think " Steve 's " a Cop " Steve got out a piece of paper , a pencil , and an envelope from the bartender . He turned around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sealed it in the envelope . I got suspicious . I thought maybe he might be a. cop trying to trap me getting a girl for him . You see I 'm an exconvict . " " I said , ' Steve , I 'm doing this for you only as a favor . But are you a cop ? ' He laughed and said , ' John , if you knew the truth , you 'd really get a kick out of it .

He ' said he hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said . " Then Steve went to his coat , which was in the closet , came , back and tossed a fistful of $20s on the bed . He said he was half looped and asked me to count it : I did . There was $2,480 . He pulled another $20 from his pocket , handed me the $2,500 and said , ' John , I want you to keep this for me . ' " He walked to the closet , came back with a .38 caliber revolver and said , ' Ai n't this a beaut . ' " The three then went out to eat , Hager said . Later Hall told Hager to rent a car in his name and buy another suitcase and briefcase . " I left about midnight , but returned the next morning with the rented car , the suitcase and the briefcase . Steve was wild , pacing up and down like a mad man . He said the plans had been changed . He said for me to take Sandy in the rented car , drop her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . " There 's a Million Dollars " " I asked him why he could n't ride in with us . He said , ' I 've got something I want to do . ' We left . After we got out on the highway , Sandy said she had seen one of the suitcases open and that it was ' leaded with $10 and $20 bills . ' " ' There must be a million dollars back there , ' she said . " That 's when I got scared . " Hager said that when he returned to Steve , Hall told him he was an ex-convict and that insurance investigators were looking for him .
