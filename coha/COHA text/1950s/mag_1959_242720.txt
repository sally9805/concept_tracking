When John Long got out of the Army Air Corps in 1945 , he and his wife Mary moved into a rented , one-bedroom house in a suburb of Phoenix , Ariz , while he built his own house . He worked on the new house for six months with Mary 's help ( she did the painting and finishing touches ) . When it was finished , Long got an offer for the house , sold it at a $4,300 profit . He and his wife set to work building another house , but they sold that one too-and the next , and the next . By last week , John Long , 38 , had built nearly 10,000 houses worth more than $100 million , had risen to the top of the U.S. home-building industry with a flair for showmanship and a knack of building the most house for the least money . <P> At Long 's 7,500-house Maryvale development , seven miles northwest of Phoenix , he sells a house with three bedrooms , two baths , an all-electric kitchen , a garage and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranging from $8,975 to $25,950 , offer extra space , glamour and luxury touches ( gables , palm trees , sliding glass doors ) , yet sell for about $1,500 less than those of most of his competitors . Last week Long added yet another attraction : with each purchase , he will give a free acre of mountain retreat land near the Kaibab National Forest , 178 miles north of Phoenix , provide a modern cabin on it for $1,695 . <P> New Models . With such imaginative merchandising , John Long last year built and sold 2,500 houses worth more than $30 million , shared the home-building record of the year with Miami 's Mackle brothers , who build their houses for General Development Corp . ( TIME , March 30 ) . Unlike the Mackles and most other big builders , Long is building all his houses in a single location , plans to put up at least 8,000 more houses before Maryvale is completed . He offers new models every six months to attract customers . Says Long : " It 's like retooling and offering new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenician who stopped his formal training in high school , Long learned an invaluable lesson soon after he began building : " It 's easier and cheaper to do it yourself than to subcontract . And volume is the key to continued growth . " Long hired his own crew , used every known labor-saving device , estimated his costs to the penny . In his first development , he built 134 houses for $7,400 each , cleared only about $350 on each . Then , in 1953 , to take advantage of the 10% down payment introduced by Congress for $7,000-or-under houses during the Korean War , he lowered his sights to a $7,000 house , contented himself with a $250 profit on each .
