Out of Jordan , with censorship lifted , came the story of how 21-year-old King Hussein snatched control of his desert kingdom from under the noses of the Redlined leaders of the Palestinian Arabs , who outnumber his Bedouins two to one . It was a wild story that combined the dash of a Latin American army coup with the wile of an Arabian Nights adventure . <P> The moment of decision came on a Saturday night at Zerka , a town and army camp northeast of Amman . From the outside , the outbreak of fighting among Jordan 's troops seemed a nationalist-inspired mutiny . In actual fact , the young King had carefully planned it . For months Hussein had been aware of the dangers of being swept away by Arab nationalist extremists , and made his preparations . He journeyed down to Medina to see Saudi Arabia 's King Saud , just before Saud left for his trip to the U.S. Saud , whose fear of Communist penetration of the Middle East far outweighs his old feud with Hussein 's Hashemite clan , promised full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hussein hurried back to Jordan , began lining up Bedouin sheiks to sway the Bedouin troops , who comprise nearly half the Jordanian army . He gave them gifts , obtained jobs for sheiks ' sons . To offset the proCommunists ' control of the street mobs , he approached leaders of the fanatically anti-Western ( and antiCommunist ) Moslem Brotherhood , and his agents supplied black market weapons bought with Saudi money . Often the young King drove out for secret , late-night meetings with chosen leaders on lonely roads outside Amman . Hussein picked Zerka for his showdown because a crack Bedouin regiment was stationed there and the Moslem Brotherhood was strong in the town . <P> Sheiks &; Brothers . The crisis came when Army Chief Abu Nuwar , the playboy general and his onetime boon companion , told Hussein that if he did not appoint Abdel Halim Nimr as Premier , the army would force him to . Hussein acted . On signal , his men spread word in Zerka that Communists headed by Abu Nuwar were about to seize the royal palace and overthrow the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bedouin garrison began attacking officers and an infantry unit known to support Abu Nuwar . They fought first with stones and rifle butts , later with bullets . Twelve men were killed or wounded in the melee . Then , as the desert warriors and the mob merged and started a wild surge down the road to Amman , a loyal officer telephoned Hussein at the palace . <P> The King ordered General Abu Nuwar to come along , jumped into a limousine and raced toward Zerka with an escort of five jeeploads of Bedouin Tommy-gunners . On the road the convoy met the rampaging Bedouins , who went wild with cheers , firing in the air and screaming : " Down with Abu Nuwar ! Down with the Communists ! " One wild-eyed Bedouin officer charged toward Abu Nuwar with rifle ready . Hussein ordered him to halt , thus saved the cowering Abu Nuwar 's life . <P> Directing the trembling Abu Nuwar to return and wait for him at the palace , the young King leaped atop an armored car and shouted : " If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " With a tremendous shout , the Bedouins ripped off their headdresses and threw them on the ground-a spontaneous Arab gesture of loyalty and acclaim .
