There was never any doubt about what Alberto Ascari would be-if he lasted long enough to grow up . All his life . Alberto had lived with the sound , smell and danger of high-speed engines . Before he was five , he learned how to handle the wheel from his racing-driver father . Perched on papa 's knee , little Alberto navigated the back roads of Milan , Italy , and the graceful curves of the old race track at Monza . By the time Alberto was seven , the elder Ascari was dead , killed in a crash at Montlhry in the French Grand Prix . But the youngster was already determined to devote his life to racing autos . <P> Poker Price . He began by racing motorcycles . As a schoolboy , he played poker to raise the price of bike rentals , and he competed wherever he could-from the Milan piazza to the open-road races through northern and central Italy . He cracked up soon and often , but he kept coming back . In 1940 , when he was 21 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first mounts ; for his first big races in the Mille Miglia and at Palermo , he managed to get hold of a Ferrari . Motor trouble forced him out each time . <P> A cool , skillful technician , completely devoid of Latin temperament , utterly dependent upon his knowledge of engines and his exquisite reflexes , Alberto ( " Ciccio " ) * Ascari finally hit his stride in the auto-racing heyday after World War II . He traveled everywhere-Spain , England , Argentina-and everywhere other drivers ate his dust . He worked up a fine feud with Argentina 's Champion Juan Manuel Fangio . In Brazil one day in 1949 , he swung too wide on a turn , hit a roadside rock , turned turtle and wound up with a broken collarbone , three broken ribs and three fewer teeth than he started with . <P> Last Crash . The accident only meant that Alberto had to sit still for a while . While he did , Enzo Ferrari , who manufactured some of the fastest cars in competition , caught up with him and hired him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding Alberto Ascari . Every year , in his Ferraris , he scored more Grand Prix points , and every year he sped closer to death . In The Netherlands Grand Prix in 1949 , he lost a wheel while doing 120 m.p.h . Somehow , he survived the wreck . In 1953 , at Monza , after winning the Grand Prix championship for the second year in a row , he spun off the track , tangled with two other cars and walked away once more . <P> His luck was too good to last . At Monte Carlo last week , Ascari catapulted through a bale of hay and landed in the Mediterranean . This time he was badly cut around the head . Only four days later , though , he was back at the wheel , testing a car on the Monza track . He was a national hero ; he seemed to feel Italy expected such perseverance . In a borrowed 3,000-liter Ferrari , Ciccio Ascari , 36 , spun into a crash for the last time . He was dead before the ambulance reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in the waistland between " chubby " and " fatso. "
