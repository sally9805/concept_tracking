SINCE it was founded in 1947 , the Washington law firm of Arnold , Forms &; Porter has served , in more than a hundred cases , in the difficult and unpopular role of defense counsel for persons accused of disloyalty to the United States . All of these cases , including the Senate trial of Owen Lattimore and several others which required weeks of legal labor , have been handled without fee . The publicity which the firm has received from this singularly unremunerative practice has apparently created an impression , in some quarters , that Messrs . Thurman Arnold. , Abe Fortas , and Paul Porter are impractical idealists with a lofty scorn for monetary reward . This , happily , is not the case . If they did despise money , they would now be very miserable men , for they are rolling in it . The exact figure of their annual income is a secret between themselves and the Bureau of Internal Revenue . But their prosperity is so evident that envious colleagues have begun to make wry jokes about it ? the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that neighboring lawyers in the swank Ring Building have stopped taking clients of their own , in order to devote their full time to chasing down the thousand-dollarbills which flutter , unnoticed , out of the door of the Arnold , Fortas &; Porter suite . There is no mystery about the source of their impressive income . It comes from the Coca-Cola Company , Pan American Airways , Lever Brothers , Western Union Telegraph , Otis and Company , the Sun Oil Company , the American Broadcasting Company , and several dozen other large and solvent corporations which have retained the firm to handle their Washington legal affairs . Most law firms would be delighted to build up such a well-heeled clientele over a period of two or three decades . Arnold , Fortas &; Porter have done it in barely four years . It is evident , moreover , that they have attracted their corporate clients in spite of , rather than because of , their widely-publicized reputation for defending the civil liberties of alleged Communists . One can not readily imagine Mr. Joseph Pew hiring them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in the Lattimore case . It is obvious also that Arnold , Fortas &; Porter are not cashing in on good will which they built up in the business community during their long service as government officials . They were all New Dealers of the most virulent stripe and each was , in his own way , a bete noir of corporation executives . Clearly Arnold , Fortas &; Porter have something ? individually or collectively ? which hard-headed business men appraise as rare and valuable . It could be any one of several things because ? both individually and collectively ? they are a remarkable trio . T HURMAN ARNOLD iS a fight-loving Westerner , who has a flamboyant sense of humor and one of the best legal minds in the country . He has been described as an " intuitional genius " on a number of occasions by men who are careful in their choice of words . Certainly , Arnold has many of the familiar attributes of genius , including a broad streak of eccentricity . He thinks so much more rapidly than he is able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost incoherent succession of elliptical sentences and phrases that mean a lot to Arnold , but very little to the unpracticed listener . Anyone who has ever talked to him for five minutes will forever stand in awe of Miss Marguerite O'Brien , who has been his secretary for sixteen years . He is also , in the classic mold , absentminded . There are innumerable anecdotes about occasions on which he has taken the wrong train , gone to the wrong courtroom , or argued the wrong case . The best , which is surely apocryphal , relates that Arnold once delivered a masterful summation on behalf of the plaintiff , only to be reminded that he was counsel for the defendant . Whereupon , he made an even more powerful presentation , in which he refuted his previous arguments on every point , and won the case . At sixty , Arnold is now well embarked on his fifth major career . His first was as a politician in his home town of Laramie , Wyoming . He began running for office as soon as he got home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor of Laramie , by nine votes . Somewhat later , he won a seat in the state legislature . He is best remembered there for an occasion on which he nominated himself for Speaker , filibustered three days on his own behalf , and then dramatically announced that he would not accept the nomination . His political career was terminated by the West Virginia College of Law which offered him a job in 1927 as its Dean . Arnold accepted and found the academic life very much to his taste . After three years , he transferred to the faculty of Yale Law School , where he won wide recognition as an authority on legal procedure and , despite stiff competition , as a campus character . He got into a row with the Registrar , who objected to Arnold 's habit of taking his dog with him to class . Arnold faced down the hapless Registrar by maintaining in a lengthy brief that he had a perfect right to take a horse to class if he owned one . He also intimated that he might acquire one if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While he was teaching at Yale , Arnold endeared himself to the late President Roosevelt by publishing an article in a prominent law journal defending the " court-packing " plan . He also wrote and published a best-selling book , The Folklore of Capitalism . Mr. Roosevelt , who apparently had read the former but not the latter , called Arnold to Washington in 1937 to be Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Anti-Trust Division of the Justice Department . Some of the Senators who had to pass on the appointment had read Arnold 's witty , iconoclastic book , and they badgered him with questions about several statements in it , notably the assertion that the anti-trust laws are a farce whose " actual result was to promote the growth of industrial monopolies by deflecting the attack on them into purely moral and ceremonial channels . " After eating several pages of his own sparkling prose , Arnold persuaded the Senators that he would vigorously enforce the Sherman and Clayton Acts as " the best available instruments " for making war on monopolies . No promise made to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , Arnold became the greatest trust-buster in American history . He filed 230 suits against alleged conspiracies in restraint of trade ? more suits than had been filed in the entire previous fifty-year history of the Sherman Act . Making his own precedents as he went , Arnold waded fearlessly into such giants as the American Medical Association , Standard Oil Company of New Jersey , Associated Press , and finally , to the horror of Democratic politicians , the building trade unions of the American Federation of Labor . Shortly after he drew a legal bead on union featherbedding practices , Arnold suddenly found himself elevated to a judgeship on the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia . Most lawyers would have been delighted with a lifetime appointment to a court which is second only to the Supreme Court in prestige and importance . But Arnold was bored stiff . He chafed under the inactivity and impartiality of the bench like a gladiator barred from the arena . He used to complain bitterly that " all I do is sit here and write little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After two years , he abandoned the security of the bench to venture , at middle age , into private law practice . Ironically , people who think they are flattering him still address him as " Judge Arnold . " II BE BE Foal-As is as nearly the exact opposite of Arnold , in personality and tempera- ment , as it is possible to conceive . Where Arnold is flamboyant , Fortas is quiet , indrawn , and soft-spoken . One sometimes suspects that Arnold is striking a pose , but Fortas gives the impression of being the most earnest man alive . Arnold finds the solution to a legal problem by cerebrative tour de force , a flash of insight which skips over all the intermediate stages of reasoning . Fortas is equally brilliant , but in an entirely different way . He is the logician , the meticulous craftsman of the law , who analyzes a problem as a chemist analyzes a strange compound . He thinks far more slowly than Arnold , but is in a much better position to defend his conclusions when he reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age for a man who has already completed what most men would consider a full lifetime of accomplishment . But then Fortas has always been what newspaper rewrite men are wont to call a " boy wonder . " He entered Yale Law School , from Memphis , Tennessee , at the tender age of nineteen , and proceeded to make a tremendous impression on his teachers , including Arnold and William 0 . Douglas . Fortas was elected editor of the Yale Law Journal and was appointed to the MAGAZINE faculty immediately after he graduated cum laude . When Douglas came to Washington in 1934 to head the Securities and Exchange Commission , Fortas came with him , He spent four years as Douglas ' top legal aide , and played a major role in the whole New Deal experiment in reforming Wall Street . It was at about this time that Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes decided he had better fall in step with the times and build up a " brain trust " of his own . He pirated Fortas away from Douglas , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortas climbed rapidly as a protege of the Old Curmudgeon . By 1942 , when he was only thirty-two years old , he had become Undersecretary of the Interior . Except for a brief hiatus during the war , when he tried to enlist in the Navy but was turned down for bad eyes , Fortas remained in the number two Interior Department post until he " retired " in 1946 ? just one month before Ickes ' stormy departure from the government . III p AUL PORTER is the extrovert of the firm . If Arnold has the mien of a professor , and Fortas that of a minister , Porter is apt to be taken for a politician or a successful salesman . Still youthfully handsome at forty-seven , he is a smooth dresser , an excellent story-teller , a masterful mixer of mint juleps , and an all-round very pleasant fellow . The greatest tribute to his personal charm is that he served for nearly a year as Price Administrator without making any lasting enemies . Though Porter is unquestionably astute , no one would describe him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gab that makes him a persuasive conversationalist in private and an eloquent advocate in court . His arguments , even before the august Supreme Court , are liberally seasoned with wit . That may be one reason why the word-weary justices usually compliment Porter warmly for his presentation ? even when they rule against him . Porter has held jobs in so many different Federal agencies that he sometimes refers to himself as " The Bobo Newsom of the Bureaucrats . " He came to Washington at the very beginning of the New Deal , in .1933 , to help the Agricultural Adjustment Administration sell farmers on the idea of plowing under every third row of their cotton crops . At that time , Porter was primarily a newspaperman , although he also had a law degree which he had picked up at the University of Kentucky while serving as city editor of the Lexington Herald . He originally planned to stay in Washington only three months , but one thing led to another and he found himself acting as General Counsel of the AAA . When the Supreme Court finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succumbed to . Potomac fever . He remained in Washington as counsel for the Columbia Broadcasting System . This interlude of private practice lasted until the war started , when Porter was called back into the government for service in a series of emergency agencies . He helped write the price-control law and served as a special deputy to Leon Henderson in setting up the rent-control program of the Office of Price Administration . His success in this difficult job attracted the attention of President Roosevelt , who tabbed Porter as a " trouble shooter " for war agencies . He served for a while as Associate War Food Administrator and , when that program was well launched , was made an assistant to Fred M. Vinson as Economic Stabilization Director . By 1944 Porter was so high in Roosevelt 's esteem that he was chosen publicity director of the Democratic National Committee for the fourth-term campaign . Immediately after the election , FDR appointed him Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission . Porter was allowed to enjoy the comparative peace and quiet of that position for a little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowles as head of the Office of Price Administration . For the second time in his bureaucratic career , Porter had a Federal agency die beneath him . The OPA ordeal lasted eleven months , and Potter emerged with what he described as " minor flesh wounds in the back . " By now he was having trouble deciding whether he was a politician , lawyer , newspaperman , or bureaucrat . President Truman decided the issue for him , temporarily , bymaking him a diplomat . Porter went to Greece early in /947 with the rank of Ambassador to launch the " Truman Doctrine " Greek aid program , an assignment which he handled with notable success . IV A RNOLD , FORTAS BC PORTER complement one another as do the ingredients in one of Bernard DeVoto 's martinis . But , unlike those martinis , their association as law partners was not carefully planned in advance . It just happened . Arnold 's first partner after he quit the bench in the spring of 1945 was Arne C. Wiprud , who had worked with him in the Justice Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back into the government . Arnold naturally thought of his old student at Yale , and invited Fortas to join him . They had been in practice together for more than a year when Porter returned from the diplomatic wars in May 1947 . They decided they needed another partner , and offered to take Porter into the firm . Porter accepted . He had known Arnold and Fortas only casually , but their firm had a good and growing reputation . " The other lawyers used to call them ' Arnold , Fortas Rc Integrity , ' " he recalled recently . " When I came into the firm , we tried to find a good spot for Integrity . But nobody in Washington would have him , so he 's still with us . " It was not long before they had a chance to prove that Integrity was still on the payroll . Soon after Porter 's arrival , a group of seven State Department employees came to the office , seeking counsel . They had been summarily dismissed from their jobs . No charges had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been held . But notations had been placed in their personnel records indicating that they had been fired for disloyalty . With that black mark against them , they had found it impossible to get decent jobs anywhere else . Listening to their story , the partners formulated a belief which they have held ever since , and which they have striven mightily to get the President and the Supreme Court to share . Briefly stated , it is this : It may be necessary to suspend normal Civil Service procedures in time of stress and drop employees from the government payroll without ceremony or explanation . But no American should ever be branded a traitor , by a " loyalty " dismissal from the government or by any other means , without a fair trial , complete with sworn testimony , cross-examination of witnesses , and other evidence acceptable in court . They took the case of the seven State Department employees and began casting around for some way to help them . They soon found a powerful ally . Arnold was invited to speak at the New York Herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with Mrs. Helen Reid , the owner of that great newspaper . Mrs. Reid telephoned Bert Andrews , the Herald Tribune Washington Bureau manager , and asked him to look into the story . Andrews did , and wrote a series of articles that shocked the nation and won him a Pulitzer Prize . With the help of Andrews ' expos ? , the attorneys had little trouble persuading the State Department to remove all unfavorable notations from the records of the ousted employees . They were permitted to resign without prejudice and soon found jobs elsewhere . A short while thereafter , President Truman issued his now-famous executive order setting up elaborate machinery for FBI investigations , departmental hearings , and appeals to a Civil Service Commission Review Board in loyalty cases . F OR a time , Arnold , Fortas &; Porter thought they had won a clear-cut victory for their point of view . But they soon began to receive more visits from government workers . These men and women told of being called before Loyalty Boards where they were confronted with unspecific charges , made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty-check procedures were not working out , in actual practice , as the partners had hoped . They took up the cudgels again . At first , they tried to represent every worthy individual who came to them for help . They laid down three rules : they would accept no pay for any loyalty case ; they would insist on a " full disclosure " from the government employee ; and they would warn anyprospective client that they would drop his case immediately if they found that he had concealed or misrepresented any material fact about his activities or associations. * The word quickly got around that an innocent government employee who got into loyalty trouble could get free legal aid from Arnold , Fortas &; Porter . The firm was swamped . The harassed attorneys began looking around for a " test case " in which , they hoped , the broad principles at stake could be settled once and for all . They thought they had found what they were looking for in the case of Dorothy Bailey . Miss Bailey was an $8,000-a-year training officer on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called before the agency 's Loyalty Board in 1948 and was told that she had been accused of being a member of the Communist party . The charge was made by an anonymous informant who claimed to have seen her at Communist meetings . Neither Miss Bailey nor her attorneys were ever able to find out the identity of her accuser , nor where and when she was alleged to have attended Communist meetings . Porter was , and is , certain that she was the victim of a frame-up by real Communists who resented her opposition to their programs within a government employees ' union . But Porter was never able to persuade the Loyalty Board that this might be " a modern Dreyfus Case . " He was compelled to base Miss Bailey 's defense entirely on " positive " character witnesses who swore that she had favored Lend-Lease before Germany attacked Russia ; that she strongly endorsed the Marshall Plan ; and that she bitterly opposed Henry A. Wallace 's third-party candidacy for President . The Loyalty Board found " reasonable grounds " to doubt Miss Bailey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upheld the action . Arnold , Fortas &; Porter appealed to the courts . They felt they had an open-and-shut case and were confident that it was just a matter of time before the Federal Judiciary would thunder with righteous Con* Sometimes they went even farther than that . Owen Lattimore has described in his recent book how Fortas " tested " him , with a convincing threat of imprisonment for perjury , before the firm agreed to represent him at his Senate hearing . stitutional wrath and order drastic reforms in the loyalty-check procedures . But they were destined to suffer the bitterest disappointment of their legal careers . With one of its three judges violently dissenting , the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that no Constitutional issue was involved which would warrant judicial intervention in Miss Bailey 's dismissal . Arnold , Fortas Sc Porter appealed to the Supreme Court . For the first-time in history , they filed no brief of their own , but simply called the attention of the High Tribunal to the dissenting opinion written by Judge Henry W. Edgerton in the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . and Porter made what many of his colleagues consider the most eloquent argument of its kind since Zola 's appeal in the first Dreyfus Case . But it was all to no avail . Paralyzed by a four-to-four split , the Supreme Court handed down no opinion at all in the case . That had the effect of upholding the lower court 's finding in the specific case of Miss Bailey , but it left the Constitutional issues right where they were when Arnold , Fortas C Porter started . Since the Bailey case , the partners have sharply restricted their " loyalty practice . " They still take occasional , exceptional cases , usually at the urging of some high-level government official who does not want to lose a valued subordinate . But most of the government workers who come to their offices now are referred to young attorneys whom the partners consider competent . and who are willing to conduct a loyalty defense for a modest per diem fee . They explain that this does not represent any disillusionment on their part . They feel that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in loyalty procedures as far as they can , until and unless the Supreme Court changes , or rather makes up , its collective mind . They also feel that they can make " no substantive contribution " to existing procedures by fighting out individual cases , and that they therefore might as well leave most of this time-consuming work to younger attorneys , who are not so heavily engaged with other clients . idealists may find this answer something less than . 100 per cent satisfactory , but the passing of such judgments should perhaps be left to those whohave done more than these three attorneys in defense of due process . Arnold , Fortas &; Porter never expected to gain anything , financially , from their loyalty cases . On the contrary , they were warned repeatedly by their friends that they were running a risk of driving off " respectable " clients or , still worse , getting themselves tarred by the red brush . They were keenly conscious of both risks , particularly at the time of the Lattimore uproar . But they stuck with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some things you have to do in order to live with yourself . " The . amazing thing is that they have never lost a client because of it . The only corporation executive among their clientele who ever mentioned the subject to them was a very wealthy man , of decidedly conservative political views , who happened to be in Washington during the Lattimore hearing . He approached Fortas after it was over and said : " I want you to know that I am proud to be represented by lawyers with that kind of courage . " V T HE first decision which Arnold , Fortas &; Porter made as partners was that they would practice law . To the sane citizens of other communities , that may seem an absurdly obvious decision for a law firm to make . But in the miasmic moral climate of Washington , it was a radical step ? so radical that many skeptics find it hard to believe that they are sincere about it . There are about 3,185 attorneys listed in the Washington Classified Telephone Directory . A large percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filing ? briefs , addressing juries , and performing the other normal functions of law practice . But to cognoscenti of the capital 's ways , these hard-working and reputable professional men are not embraced in the phrase , " Washington Lawyer . " That is reserved for the small army of smooth operators , many of them " graduates " of Congress or the Executive agencies , who hang out law shingles only to provide respectable fronts for devious maneuverings . These maneuverings are known , for want of a better expression , as - practicing influence . " Some of the practitioners , especially the ex-Senators and Representatives , specialize in " legislative counseling " or what the layman would call lobbying . Others wangle contracts or special favors from Executive agencies on a contingent fee basis ; that is , they get five per cent , or some fixed sum , if they produce the goods for a business-man client . Occasionally some enterprising souls venture into this lucrative work without taking the precaution of acquiring a law degree . These unlicensed operators are the ones who get exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were important and well-connected men in government , and because they are so evidently prospering , Arnold , Fortas &; Porter are widely suspected of practicing influence . They are painfully aware of this fact , and they denounce the suspicion in the most vehement terms as an injustice . " We are not five percenters and we are not fixers , " Porter will say , pounding on his desk with his fist . " We do n't pretend to have any influence and we do n't try to get contracts for anybody . " Arnold nods his head in emphatic agreement . " We are marketing what we know , not who we know , " he says . " We are representing people who have a lot more influence in this town than any of us ever had . " Fortas , sensing the need for corroborative evidence , cites several facts about the firm 's history and policies . One of the most convincing is that there is a rigid partnership agreement which forbids the acceptance of any case before a government agency on a contingent fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . ( It also tends to bar small business men who can not afford a $1,500 minimum retainer . ) Fortas also notes that the firm has registered only twice under the Lobbying Act , which " legislative counselors " are very careful to respect . The two registrations represent an effort , on behalf of Western Union , to get a lower excise tax rate on telegrams , and an effort , on behalf of a mail-order organization , to repeal certain barriers to interstate shipment of cigarettes . The third item of evidence which Fortas introduces in the firm 's defense is a letter MAGAZINE sent out to all clients at the start of the defense mobilization program . It states that the firm is ready to advise its " established clients " on the interpretation of economic-control regulations , and to represent those clients in seeking relief or modification in cases where adjustment procedures are specifically provided . " That is a polite way of saying , " Do n't expect us to sneak in the side doors of the control agencies and wangle special treatment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exonerated of trying to win contracts or influence Congress , what do they do for their apparently well-satisfied clients ? For obvious reasons , they are unwilling to discuss the specific legal affairs of any of their clients . But they define their practice , in general terms , as " a normal amount of administrative work " plus a " more than average amount of litigation . " ' " Administrative work , " in Washington law parlance , means helping business men get along with , or around , the federal government 's administrative and regulatory agencies . It covers a vast range of activities from formal pleadings before quasi-judicial bodies such as the Interstate Commerce Commission to highly informal " consultations " with individual officials in charge of such things as setting price ceilings , granting materials priorities , or formulating credit regulations . Because of their common background of high administrative office , Arnold , Fortas &; Porter have both the skill and the entree to perform this sort of work particularly well . They know the intricate procedures of the regulatory agencies from firsthand experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter consideration is important because often the most difficult problem a business man faces in Washington is getting in to see the right man . It is a matter of record that Arnold , Fortas &; Porter appear frequently before the three regulatory commissions which reflect their respective pasts . Currently , for example , they are defending Lever Brothers in a restraint of trade hearing before the Federal Trade Commission ; they are waging intricate legal warfare with the Securities and Exchange Commission in an effort to prevent it from revoking the brokerage license of Otis and Company in connection with the abortive Kaiser-Frazer stock issue ; and they are representing Western Union in an appeal to the Federal Communications Commission for a 10 per cent increase in telegraph tolls . Administrative practice is the bread-and-butter work of every reputable Washington attorney ; many do nothing else . The noteworthy thing about Arnold , Fortas &; Porter is that they have not made it their specialty . THEIR true love , it is apparent from even a brief conversation with them , is litiga- tion ? especially litigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court level . A good example of the kind of case they like best , and the kind of trial work for which they are acquiring a national reputation , was a recent lawsuit in which they represented Keifer-Stewart , Inc. , an Ohio liquor wholesaler , in seeking treble damages from two of the nation 's largest distilleries , Seagram and Calvert . Simply put , the issue was whether the distilleries had a legal right to cut off shipments from the wholesaler when Keifer-Stewart refused to abide by established minimum wholesale prices . Legally , it involved complex questions about the wartime price-control statute ( which Porter helped to draft ) and the anti-trust laws ( which , so far as court interpretations are concerned , heavily bear Arnold 's imprint ) . The case was fought all the way up to the Supreme Court before Arnold , Fortas Sc Porter won a $1,200,000 judgment for their client . As a result of this and numerous other successes in appellate courts , they are beginning to establish themselves as a " lawyer 's law firm . " More and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them to be argued before the Supreme Court . Porter personally argued three cases before the High Tribunal in one recent term , which is unofficially believed to be the all-time record . Their trial work , however , is not limited to Washington courts . At the time this article was being written , Fortas was arguing a case before a federal court in Newark , New Jersey ; Arnold was en route to Denver , Colorado , for another trial ; Porter was drawing up a brief to be filed in Elk City , Oklahoma ; and other members of the firm were working on suits to be tried in New York City , Russell ville , Arkansas , and Brunswick , Georgia . As Porter puts it , " We 're apt to show up in court almost anywhere . " The partners apparently do not try to limit their practice to any particular types of litigation , although they handle a particularly large number of treble damage suits under the anti-trust laws . The only fixed rule is that two of the partners must agree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " right " for Arnold , Fortas Sc Porter . No attempt is made to channel all cases of a particular type to the partner whose background best suits him to " specialize " in that work . Instead , the work is distributed at partnership meetings on the basis of who has a free hand . Under this novel procedure , Fortas has handled more anti-trust actions in the past two years than Arnold . The partners feel that none of their particular know-how is lost by this arrangement , since eventually they all have a hand in preparing for any major case . There is a fixed rule that no brief , however minor , can leave the office without being worked over and approved by two partners . On a really tough case , Arnold is likely to supply the procedural strategy and other contributions of intuition ; Fortas will supervise the arraying of evidence and precedents ; and Porter will be assigned to do the actual arguing before the Supreme Court . There is one kind of compartmentalization , of a different sort from that in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " belongs " to one of the partners in the sense that this partner is personally responsible for the client 's overall legal work , even though someone else may be handling a particular case . Porter says this tends to assure a big corporation the same kind of personal interest in its affairs that a small-town banker gets from his local lawyer . This analogy , however , probably will not bear stretching too far . The firm , of course , comprises a great deal more legal talent than that which resides in the fertile brains of the three " principal partners . " There are also five " partners " ? they frown on the adjective " junior " ? who are brilliant lawyers in their own right , albeit somewhat obscured at the moment by the fame of the founding fathers . They are Dr. Walton Hamilton , a Yale Law professor for twenty-five years ; Milton Freeman , former assistant general counsel of the Securities and Exchange Commission ; Norman Diamond , former assistant to Thomas E. Dewey when the latter was a racket-busting district attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Harry Plotkin , counsel for the Federal Communications Commission for eleven years . In addition there is the usual complement of bright young men fresh out of law school , who are known as " Associates . " The morale of the entire office is exceedingly high . The visitor gets the feeling that everybody there likes everybody else , and that all of them are intensely proud of being qn the Arnold , Fortas &; Porter team . This is especially true of the principal partners themselves . They get along famously despite their totally dissimilar personalities , and they obviously have a high degree of mutual admiration . But then ? as one attorney is reputed to have said as he chased a thousand dollar bill down the hall ? " Why should n't they ? "
