Just a Simple Country Boy ? Story by Priscilla D. Willis Drawings by N. M. Bodecker I D 0 N ' T aim to sell him , " the cowboy said , gazing steadfastly into Charles ' eager eyes . " Not exactly , that is . A good home for hint means more to me than money . This horse is about my best friend ; he always done everything I ever ast him . " He shifted his narrow hips above his wishbone legs encased , like sausages , in blue denim levis . " Course , " he added somewhat apologetically , " I reckon I 'd have to have a little something for him . " " Of course , " Charles agreed . " How much ? " " Weil , " the cowboy replied , drawing a tiny circle on the frozen ground with the pointed toe of his boot , " first thing is to see if you lolks like him . Then we can git down to trading . " He had his own method of doing business , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you say he 's a good horse with cattle . " Charles was a little impatient . " That 's all I want . " My husband has his methods , too . He buys and sells bonds and stocks by simply picking up a telephone , and the deal is consummated before you can say Dow Jones . Twenty-five years in a brokerage firm have left him with the impression that a quick trade is the expedient . way to transact business , and prolonged conversation about anything makes him nervous . When he isnervous he rolls his fingers up into the palms of his hands and then unrolls them again , like window shades going up and down . " Do n't you want to see him rode . even ? " the cowboy asked suspiciously . He took a cigarette from the pocket of his plaid woolen jacket and put it carefully in his mouth . " Well , yes , " my husband replied . " As a matter of fact , I was thinking of riding him myself . ' ' Without taking his gentian-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a wooden match with his thumbnail , cupped his rough hands under the wide brim of his hat and held the flame to his cigarette . Solemnly , he observed Charles ' legs in his Newmarket boots like toothpicks sticking out of a baked potato beneath the alpaca-lined storm coat , bunched and belted at his waist which the good things of life have expanded to a bacchanalian Forty-four . He regarded the cashmere scarf , knotted at his throat , the English cap above Charles ' face empurpled by a cruel wind hustling through the empty shedrow . " You ride pretty good ? " he said at last . " I 've ridden all my life , " Charles declared with briskness , and quickly sketched his qualifications as an equestrian from the time he was nine with his first pony , through the dude ranch days in Arizona , the bridle trails in the forest preserve , and more recently his necessity for riding on his farm in Alabama . " I 've got to have a decent cow horse down there , " lie concluded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; , . .. 3317.4r1 : ? i ? i ? ? - his delicately pointed forth as if trying to identify unfamiliar and not particularly agreeable sounds . He looked a great deal livelier in his stall than he had looked loping around the racetrack where we watched him during the slimmer with the cowboy on his back carrying the films from the patrol towers after each race . He stopped at the towers on the backstretch while the cowboy picked up the films , and then moving in close to the rail , galloped back to the grandstand where the films were delivered to the stewards , " That , " Charles had remarked on many occasions , " is a horse I would like to have . Look at him . He goes on a loose rein , and has a fine , easy canter . Looks like a first-rate cutting horse , too . " He arranged to meet the cowboy through a horse-trainer seated in the box next to ours , whoold him he 'd heard the cowboy wanted to retire he horse , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lie said , was very fond of hat horse ; he did n't want to beat him up on the tinter racing circuit as a lead pony or on the Im patrol . If Charles could wait until the end the meeting which would wind up racing in to North for this season he was sure he could et the horse for practically nothing . H A R L ES waited . The last of the race- horses had shipped out , and the barns were empty except for the film patrol horse . A cloak of cold silence hung over the stabling area ; the racetrack was barren of its customary early morning life . There were no sets out galloping , no railbirds clocking works , no young horses being schooled from the starting gate . The grandstand across the oval from the barns was forlorn in its emptiness , as purposeless as an ant hill without any ants . " I 'll put the tack on him , " the cowboy said . He took a slip-ear bridle from a peg and , picking up his stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffled off into the stall . In a very few moments the cowboy led out the horse who appeared to be walking on only three legs . " He 's lame ! " Charles shouted into the wind . " He 's dead lame ! " The cowboy curled his thin lips into an agreeable smile , revealing two rows of teeth as per-34 A SIMPLE COUNTRY BOY fectly matched as the keys on a piano . " He ai n't lame , " he said . " Not really . He 's always gimpy like this of a morning . He walks right out of it . " " Well , " said Charles , as if he did n't believe it . " Do n't you ever get up of a morning feeling kind of kinky-like and stove up ? " the cowboy asked as he tightened the latigo . Charles admitted that he did . " Same thing with this horse . " Charles looked as if he were back in the game again . He focused his wind-watered eyes upon the horse with obvious appreciation when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the icy ground . " He 's a good type , " my husband whispered ; " looks like a model quarter horse . " " He is , " said the cowboy who had picked up the whisper at twenty paces in the high wind . " He stood second in the halter class at Fort Worth . " Charles looked awfully pleased . " What , ' he asked , " is his name ? " The cowboy lowered his head in momentary embarrassment as if he had committed a minor indecency like belching in mixed company . " His registered name , " he mumbled , " the name that 's on his papers , is Excalibur , or some such foolishness , but I and my brother has always called him Sport . " " Sport , " Charles repeated , tasting the word as if it were a very green wine . " Sport . " With a single , agile movement the cowboy was in the saddle , sitting easily . perfectly balanced . He walked the horse up and down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him abruptly , and worked through a figure eight on a loose rein . " He pivots real good , do n't he ? You do n't see him going gimpy , now , do you ? " We shook our heads and smiled . " What did I tell you ? " the cowboy laughed cheerfully , and cut an imaginary steer from a non-existent herd , changing the horse 's leads with every stride . Charles commenced to unbutton his storm coat . " Can I ride him ? " he called . " Sure thing . " The cowboy dismounted with the grace of a feather floating to the ground . Charles dumped his alpaca coat into my arms , and strode out from under the shedrow . He was wearing over two sweaters , a senescent tweed riding-coat tailored at the time waistlines were nipped in directly below the armpits , and skirts were cut in generous peplums rippling at the sides and stopping abruptly at the hips . With the passage of time the peg in his khaki breecheshad slipped , for the only fullness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You just hang onto him , " Charles instructed , gathering the reins in one hand , and turning the box stirrup toward his left foot with the other . It was a long reach from the ground , and in order to achieve sufficient momentum to hoist himself into the saddle he began hopping up and down on his right foot , gaining  --  altitude all the time , but not quite enough . " Ca n't do it . " he panted. " trouble is , I 've got too many clothes on . I feel stuffed . Is n't there a mounting block around here ? " " A what ? " The cowboy was beginning to look frightened . " Something I can stand on so I can get on him . " " I 'll give you a leg up , " the cowboy offered . and keeping hold of the bridle he bent down and seized Charles by his booted ankle . " Nowt " he cried , and gave a mighty heave as he straightened his back . There was a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fleeting impression of arched legs thrusting in the rhythm of a swimming frog 's , and Charles was in the saddle . The horse steadied himself to accommodate the unaccustomed weight ; then he humped his hack slightly . " Walk him out ! " the cowboy cried . " Do n't leave him git his head down ! " Charles closed his legs on the horse 's sides and shook the reins . T H E cowboy raised his weathered face to the slate-colored sky , and his eyebrows , like two furry caterpillars , crawled up under the hand of his hat . " Sweet Jesus , " he murmured . The horse did n't move ; he just stood there with the hump in his back growing bigger . Exasperated , Charles gave the reins a sharp tug ; the horse took ten steps straight back without stopping , leaving Charles , expecting to go Forward , biting into the mane . The cowboy was making a real effort to pull himself together . " Ai n't he caitiff the fool ? " he laughed nervously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke of the whole thing . " Sport , he 's pretending he 's working against the rope you 've throwed your calf with , " he called . " He 's showing you how a good cow horse can hold a critter . Look at him back up for you ! " " Open the gap onto the racetrack ! " Charles ' voice Caine from quite a distance , because Sport had backed to the very end of the shedrow and was still going , but when he saw the opened gap , he gathered his legs under him and , exploding past us , shot auto the plowed track , where he cook the inside rail and shifted into high . He ran the first mile as handily as a racehorse with Bill Hartack up . " I reckon I been graining him too heavy , " the cowboy said morbidly , squeezing the outside rail with both hands until his knuckles turned white . " It do n't look like he 's ever going to stop . " The horse flashed by us again . his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a plume on a drum major 's hat standing out behind him . The thing hanging around his neck like a fur stole must have been Charles , but it was impossible to be sure ; it was such a blur . After several impressive laps Sport shortened stride approaching the gap , ducking through it so suddenly that Charles shifted like a cargo of bananas , slipping halfway down the side of the saddle where he clung to the leather thongs until the horse stopped abruptly . " Great ! " my husband gasped , letting go of the thongs . " A great ride ! I let him stretch his legs a little , but I could have taken him back any time I wanted to. - He was breathing a good deal harder than the horse , and his face beneath the tangle of hair on his wet forehead was the color of California redwood . His cap had blown off at the sixteenth pole . " How much do you want for him ? ' Without any hesitation the cowboy reckoned he 'd take five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice folks . " All right , " Charles said , and the cowboy , profoundly astonished , studied him carefully . The expected counter-offer at a lower figure . had not been forthcoming ; this made him uneasy , almost suspicious , but he collected himself quickly , and showing his piano teeth in a wide grin when Charles asked how he could get the horse down to his farm , replied that that would n't be no trouble at all , because he was trailing a lead pony to Florid ) , and he 'd take Sport along , dropping him off on the way . His time and the gas would n't amount to more than another couple of hundred , he added , striking while the iron placed in his hand by an agreeable il perplexing providence was still red hot . Inside the cowboy 's rusty sedan parked in front of the shedrow , Charles wrote a check and instructions how to reach his farm . The automobile looked as if it had been assembled in a hurry from odd parts lying around a junk yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that swept the ground . " Only one thing you 'd ought to remember , " . the cowboy said , folding the check and putting it in the pocket of his jacket , " do n't never put no bit in this horse 's mouth ; he do n't act good with bits . " " Really ? " said Charles , and we noticed for the first time that the horse 's bridle was rigged with a long shanked hackamore , a braided leather THE GUNFIGHTERS CONSTANCE URDANG IN eta own image , heroes . Small Men with unwieldy pistols spat Meanness , but accurately . Or Shot up the mirror in the gilt saloon That gave them back themselves , inconsequent , Unprepossessing , with important guns . Nothing was beautiful around Them . They had seen it fit to build On mud their gimcrack frontages , And in the dry months of the year mud changed To dusty powder , filtered through the cracks Between the door and jamb , as fine as rain . No door remains . They did not build For permanence . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , quick on the trigger , that across The desert sowed their empty cartridges And proved their guns , at least , were serious . roll across the nose the only means of restraint . When we reached our apartment in town , Charles telephoned his farmer , Fremont Pone , to tell him when the horse arrived , to put him in the shed with the milk cow where he could run out in her pasture . Then he sat down with his Saturday noon martini and spoke at length about how splendid it was going to be to have a good horse to ride instead of those swaybacked nags the colored boys used to count calves and mend the fences . F REMONT PONE , brought up in the tradition of the county that if work must be done at all it should he squeezed in between shooting birds in the day and hunting coons at night , reluctantly put away his shotgun during Charles ' infrequent visits to his farm . This time , however , he was waiting for us in the barn lot . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes toward the car and , moving with the same loose-jointed case as the Blue Tick hound at his side , shambled over to greet us . " Yawl know that horse ? " he began . " Well , ah done lak you tole me , all right . Ah put him in wiv the milk cow , but he been carryin ' on fierce wiv her , tormentin ' her all the tahm . He goes to kissin ' and luvvin ' her up , hoppin ' on her peelin ' her back wiv his shoes . She 's took a fright , and doan let down no milk at all . Not a drop . Ah doan believe that horse eveh seen a cow before in his whole life. - " Nonsense ! " Charles snapped , " he 's a cutting and roping horse ; he stood second in the halter class at Forth Worth . " " Mah , mah , " said Fremont Porte , but he was not really impressed . In the half light of the cow shed the milk cow trembled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind and patient , were glazed with terror . Behind her Sport was dozing , his nose resting possessively upon her striated hips . Hearing the door open , the horse picked up his head , twitched his ears , and swelled his nostrils to catch the scent of his intruders . He walked up to my husband and bumped him in the stomach with his nose . " Hello , boy , " Charles grunted , putting up a protective hand . The horse bumped him again , harder . " Now , now , " said Charles , speaking as he used to speak to the children when they were little , " now , now . " Sport wheeled and , throwing his tail up impudently , trotted out the far end of the shed into the small pasture where he bucked and ran and . standing on his hind legs , boxed at shadows with his flinty hooves . When the bridle with the hackamore Fremont Pone fashioned from some pieces of an old nude harness was completed , he adjusted it on the horse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail keg used for a mounting block . He stood with his mouth hanging open like a pocketbook idly patting the head of his hound dog as he watched Charles mount and jog off down the red road toward the upper fields where the beef cows were grazing with their calves . He followed them with his slitty eyes until they disappeared behind a stand of timber . " Ah always reckoned one good mule were worth minty horses inny day , " he commented . In hall an hour Charles returned to the house holding his right shoulder with his left hand . " I ca n't understand it , " he said , dropping heavily into a chair , " this horse will only move in a circle . " " A circle ? " " Yes . He goes perfectly straight on a loose rein for a short distance , and then all at once , no matter where he is , he is seized by a compulsion to bend to the right and continue in a circular direction . The last time he turned into that planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder gently . " The racetrack , " I said . " What do you mean , the racetrack ? " " He 's accustomed to picking up the alms from the towers on the straightaway of the backstretch , turning , and galloping back to the stands along the rail around the oval . Do n't you remember ? " " That ca n't be it . " Charles was stunned . " It seems logical . " " Of course , " he suggested unhappily , " it might be something I 'm doing . or not doing . I believe I 'll let some of the boys try him and see what he does with them . " I T WAS soon evident that Sport 's insistence upon galloping in circles had nothing whatsoever to do with Charles ' riding . Fremont Pone was rubbed against a live oak and brushed neatly from the saddle within a matter of minutes . He limped back on a painful leg , brutally skinned . Benny Sawyer , whose arms and legs hung from his long , dark body like Hags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Da ho , ee crazy , da Muth , " he observed . Leroy Pollock and Ceech Wiggins met the same misfortune , and finally , Major Emery Pugh , a neighbor , who with Mrs. Pugh dropped in one afternoon for a cup of tea . " Clearly , this is a matter of proper training , " said the major whose retirement from Fort Riley coincided with the mechanization of the U. S. Cavalry . " I can straighten him out in no time . " " But Imm'ry , " his wife protested , " you have n't been on a howess fah yeahs . " Her face beneath the large , lacy hats she always wore permanently expressed a look of pained surprise . " You malts get hurt ralulin ' this howess . " " It is not a matter of riding , my dear , " the major replied . " It is , as I have said , a matter of training . I shall begin on the ground , working him on a longe line ; when I feel he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Charles will agree , I 'll take the horse over to my place . " Charles agreed . " Do n't ever put a bit in his mouth , " he cautioned , " the cowboy said he did n't act good with bits . " " Rubbish ! " the major snorted . " That 's probably what 's the matter with him . The proper bit will accomplish wonders . ' ' A week to the very day Sport was back and the major was in the Phoebe Scott Memorial Hospital , in traction . Sport commenced getting out of his pasture and roaming around the farm at nights . Every morning the top plank of the fence was on the ground . " Ah believe he picks them spikes outen that board wiv his teeth , " Fremont Pone observed . " Them nails is pulled cleah out eveh moanin ' . " The horse learned to jump the cattle guards , eight-foot spans of railroad irons dividing the pastures , and reaching the upper fields he herded the mother cows and their calves , chasing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calves tumbled to the ground . He picked the locks on the barn doors , broke open the feed sacks , scattering the grain and tramping it into a mash ; he hopped over wire fences as if they were croquet wickets , and when he was confined in a box stall he kicked his way out and , with tail held aloft , trotted over to the hog lot where he ran back and forth in the newly-poured cement floor so that it looked like Grauman 's ? Chinese . He continued to torment the inilk cow until her nervous system was completely shot . The men spent so much time repairing buildings , mending fences , and salvaging feet ! that there was little time left to lime the fields and get the row crops in . " . At this point , " my husband remarked one evening , " I stand to lose just double what I lost down here last year . I ca n't help feeling that that damned horse is responsible for it . It is an exasperating situation . " His fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was growing increasingly nervous as week after week went by . T H E N came a day in the early spring which was to resolve the problem . It was one of those tranquil mornings when the new brilliance of the sun refreshes the winter-weary earth , extracting from it the very fragrance of growth . The pastures seemed suddenly to swell with their burden of clover , crimson oceans between forests of pine whose needles glittered as if they had been dipped in glycerin . It was the kind of day when you first realize that the sting of winter has left and will return no more ; it was also the day which marked the opening of the racing season in the North . A small car , riding very low to the ground , came slowly up the lane . Behind it was a horse trailer , obviously empty , for it was jumping skittishly from side to side . " It 's the cowboy ! " Charles exploded . " It 's that goddamned cowboy ! " " Howdy , folks , " the cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rusty sedan , " I was just heading North , and 1 figured I 'd stop in and see how you and Sport was getting along . " Charles shook the outstretched hand with something less than enthusiasm . " The horse , " lie declared , " is getting along fine ; I can not say the same for the rest of us . " The cowboy 's face puckered in concern . " Is that so ? " he said , but he did n't sound very surprised . He took a cigarette from the pocket of his plaid jacket , put it carefully in his mouth , and lighted it , waving the match until it was cool before throwing it to the ground . He stared thoughtfully at his boots stitched iu an elaborate design of yellow tulips as he took a deep drag , and slowly hissed the smoke out between his teeth . - What , " he said finally , " seems to be the matter ? " Charles spared no details recounting the disasters perpetrated by Sport . " There are enough difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing into its highest register , " without some goddamned horse wrecking everything ! You ca n't even catch him any more . " He pointed to the Pollocks ' vegetable garden behind their small house where Sport was pacing the flimsy fence protecting the turnip greens whose tender leaves were pushing up through the red soil . " Look at him now ; he 'll be in that next ! " " Ai n't that something ? " the cowboy smiled fondly . " He 's real smart , all right . " " He certainly is . He 's so smart I 'm going to get rid of him . I ca n't even look at him without losing my temper . " The cowboy shook his head sadly , but the corners of his mouth rose in a tiny smile . " Do you aim to sell him ? " he asked . " How can I sell him ? " Charles sputtered . " Everybody in the county knows what a rogue he is ! " " Why , " said the cowboy , " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , but to telt you the truth I 'm a little short on cash . Tell you what I 'll do , though ; I 'll take him back to the track with me up North . Maybe I can find a buyer for him up there . I 'll sure let you know if I do . " " Take him ! " Charles cried . " Take him right now  --  if you can catch him ' " The cowboy placed the tips of his little fingers in his mouth and exhaled one whistle . Sport raised his head quickly . He hesitated for only an instant before he trotted over and buried his head in the sleeve of the cowboy 's jacket . " He sure looks good , " the cowboy said . " Yes sir , he 's wintered real good . Must have put on a hundred pounds at least . " He encircled the brown head with a caressing arm . " Come on , boy , " he said softly to the horse . " we 're going home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . There was a rope net already filled with hay for the return journey . The cowboy climbed quickly into his rusty sedan . " it 's been real nice seeing you folks again , " he said . " Maybe I 'll git to see you at the races sometime this summer . " He gunned the ancient motor and the car and trailer moved off down the road . " You know , " Charles said , fastening his eyes on the back of the trailer where Sport 's well-rounded hindquarters were still visible above the tail gate , " that 's a sight I shall never allow myself to forget . I 'd give fifty dollars to shake the hand of the sucker who wintered that horse last year , and another fifty to know who that cowboy is going to get to do it next year . What is that quotation , something about East being East and West being West ? " " And never the twain shall meet . " " That 's it , " my husband replied , walking over to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitching rail . " But it 's all wrong . If that cowboy did his trading on Wall Street he 'd be a millionaire in no time at all . "
