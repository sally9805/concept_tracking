" The book will be published in the United States by Houghton Mifflin Company , Feb. 19 , under the title " Memoirs of the Second World War . " " As long as the free world holds together , and especially Britain and the United States , and maintains its strength , " he writes , " Russia will find that peace and plenty have more to offer than exterminatory war . The broadening of thought is a process which acquires momentum by seeking opportunity-forall who claim it . It may well be , if wisdom and patience are practised , that opportunity-forall will conquer the minds and restrain the passions of mankind .

" The epilogue , which is the only new part of the one-volume book , is Sir Winston 's own summing up of the postwar years from July , 1945 , where he ended his six-volume history of Bp Ilea ers World War II . to February , 1957 , when the epilogue was written . But Sir Winston does not merely recount history . The most valuable part of his epilogue lies in his shrewd assessment of the place of the events of which he writes in postwar history and his pungent comments upon them . Comments Culled Here are a few of them : Communism : " The doctrine of communism is slowly being separated from the Russian military machine . Nations will continue to rebel against the Soviet colonial empire , not because it is Communist , but because it is alien and oppressive . " The Soviet Union : " Russia is becoming a great commercial country . Her people experience every day in growing vigour those complications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Karl Marx more out of date and smaller in relation to world problems than they have ever been before . " " The natural forces are working with greater freedom and greater opportunity to fertilise and vary the thoughts and the power of individual men and women . They are far bigger and more pliant in the vast structure of a mighty empire than could ever have been conceived by Marx in his hovel . And when war is itself fenced about with mutual extermination , it seems likely that it will be increasingly postponed . " China : " The Chinese Government ( Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek 's ) carried within it the seeds of its own destruction .

Perhaps they were inevitable . If a note of regret is to be found in this brief account , let it not be supposed that it is in hostility to the right of Asian peoples to self-determination , or a reflection on their present standing and integrity . But the means by which the present situation was reached give pause . Was so much bloodshed necessary ? . . . " Mideast Nationalism The Middle East : " Throughout this region the world has witnessed a . surge of nationalist feeling , the consequences of which have yet to run their course . . . . Amid jubilant cries for self-government and independence , it is easy to forget the many substantial benefits that have been conferred by Western rule . " The infective violence of the birth of the state of Israel has sharpened the difficulties of the Middle East ever since . I look with admiration on the work done there . . . .
