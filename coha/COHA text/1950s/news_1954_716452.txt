txt WASHINGTON , Aug. 10 ? Considerable progress has been made toward formation of a Southeast Asia security treaty . The situation may be summarized as follows : Pakistan will join the pact , though the other so-called Colombo powers , including India , Ceylon , Burma and Indonesia , have declined . IIA conference to define the scope and terms of the treaty will convene on Sept. 6 , somewhere in Southeast Asia . The place has not been agreed to by all the nations concerned  --  but it will almost certainly be Baguio in the Philippines . qThe nations to attend will be the United States , Britain , France , Australia , New Zealand , the Philippines , Thailand and Pakistan . 9Secretary of State Dulles will head the United States delegation and most of the other foreign ministers will attend . Pierre Mendes. - France , the French Premier and Foreign Minister , is expected to be too preoccupied with domestic political problems to make the trip . ilThe treaty will undertake to protect a defined area of Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through political subversion . This area , however , will not include Hong ' Kong or Formosa . tiProvision will be made in the pact for increased economic cooperation in the area in the hope of wing the conditions of poverty on which communism thrives . In the preliminary talks that have been going on here , there has been some discussion of creating a Southeast Asian economic organization that would be open to nations not in the security pact . Preliminary Meetings On The United States has been carrying on a series of separate discussions on these subjects with various nations . For example , there was a meeting with the deputies of the other so-called ANZUS powers  --  Australia and New Zealand  --  here today . Other meetings have been in progress with representatives of Thailand and the Philippines and in London the British have been discussing the forthcoming conference with the Colombo conference powers . The Colombo powers , except Pakistan , declined to participate in the conference on the ground that they did not want to join in any treaty that would seem to ' line them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) power blocs in the world . Besides , India and Ceylon were evidently influenced by the thought that if Britain signed // such a treaty they would , through their Commonwealth association , get a certain amount ? of protection from the treaty without joining it . Pakistan , which is also in the British Commonwealth , not only rejected this position - but. is understood to have urged that the new security organization create a strong military , air and naval command to which all the signatories would contribute troops for service against any direct or indirect aggression in the area . The United States , however , is not planning at this time for any such elaborate organization . Officials here favor the creation of a small military command , situated somewhere in Southeast Asia , preferably the Philippines , which could serve as an intelligence and planning center , but not organize , at least in the foreseeable future , any such supreme command structure as in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . Subversion a Problem Secretary of State Dulles , said at his news conference today that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the week about the plans for the Southeast Asia %conference . He added that " subversion " would " certainly " be considered at the forthcoming conference . Considerable thought has been given here recently to the problem of Communist subversion in Burma . Some intelligence reports ' reaching here have indicated that the Chinese Communists have been active in organizing Burmese Communists for possible action against the Rangoon Government . This is one of the questions that has preoccupied the officials who have been planning the Conference and studying possible drafts of the treaty . How can the signatories make clear that they are concerned about subversion and aggression in nations just beyond the area of the treaty ? It is generally agreed by the negotiators that improved economic conditions everywhere . in this region would contribute to the security of Southeast and Southwest Asia . Accordingly , there haj been some discussion about how nations such as India can . be worked into the economic aspects of the treaty . Meanwhile , the United States is working on a related question 1  --  the political , economic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in this field as well . ' It is understood that about $45,000,000 has been set aside as a provisional figure for dealing with the problem of the refugees now moving from the Communist area of North Vietnam to the non-Communist Area of South Vietnam . Extremely serious political and administrative problems now exist in South Vietnam . The Vietnamese Government is no longer representative of the truncated country . All its top members are either from North Vietnam , allocated to the Communists by the Geneva agreement , or Central Vietnam , with the South unrepresented . Officials here believe that a new Government will have to be formed that is more representative and considerably more efficient than the present Government if this area , already deeply infiltrated by the Communists , is to deal with the refugee and other urgent problems . The legal head of that Government is still Bao Dai , the former Emperor of Annam , who is now in France . Washington 's enthusiasm for Bao Dai has now vanished and if the Vietnamese people decide , to maintain him permanently on the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
