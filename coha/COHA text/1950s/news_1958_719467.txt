txt The " sputnik spurt , " it might hr ralleri . It 's the proliferation all over Washington of ideas on how to 2ope with the natural scientific challenge of this age  --  and the Soviet strides . Two key Democratic senators , or instance , are proposing that a new department of science be set up in the President 's Cabinet . In this department they would corral the Atomic Energy Commission , the National Science Foundation , the National Bureau of Standards , and the Patent Office  --  the latter two now in the Department of Commerce . The Department of Commerce is n't likely to want to let go . These same two senators  --  John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota  --  also would authorize the spending of 580 million dollars in the next eight years to finance scholarship loans for students in colleges and graduate schools . President Eisenhower has proposed a program for 40,000 natural science scholarships in four years at a total federal outlay of one billion dollars . - Secrecy Studied Meanwhile the House information subcommittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " availability " of scientific and technological information ? and whether secrecy measures are hampering American research and developMent . Chairman John E. Moss ( D ) of California wants to look into those stories about highly qualified and ' ' cleared " experts who are not permitted to discuss vital research with other experts because the other experts happen to have been " cleared " by a different service or agency . Meanwhile again , the Atomic Energy Commission is preparing to do what it might have been reluctant to do in an earlier year  --  supply a substantial amount of slightly enriched uranium to Britain , for use as fuel in Britain 's atomic power program . Britain has asked the United States for this uranium . The affirmative reply forecast will signal the closer atomic cooperation between the two countries . Joint Report Due Britain and the United States are preparing , via a joint release Jan. 24 , to announce their progress to date in controlling a thermonuclear reaction  --  a research aimed at taking the H-bomb fusion reaction and putting it to work in prorducinct electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been scored yet , but London is saying that the project may take much less than the 10 to 20 years recently forecast for it . The proposal for a department of science by Senators McClellan and Humphrey  --  Senator McClellan is chairman of the Senate Government Operations Committee and Senator Humphrey heads its subcommittee on government reorganization is expected to run into roadblocks in the shape of established practices and entrenched positions . Senator McClellan says he is ready to see either amendment or deletions in his 30-page proposal , but he argues that the proposition should lead to a showdown on just how to make the government 's civilian scientific and technical operations more effective . Congress has been contending that these operations are scattered all over the lot . At present there is a scientific adviser on the President 's White House staff , Dr. James Killian , basic research is allocated to the Naval Research Laboratory , the National Science Foundation , and many other agencies , and all sorts of committees and advisory boards are functioning here and them Centralization Opposed However , some natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be . and that it would be undesirable to centralize all civilian scientific work and research under a single department . The McClellan - Humphrey proposal also would abolish the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and . establish instead standing Senate and House committees on natural science and technology . This suggestion comes just when the present joint committee is setting up a panel to deal with the conquest of outer space . The Commerce Department 's Office of Technical Services would become a bureau in the new science department , with authority to act as a central clearing house for gathering and summarizing scientific information . The secretary of the new department would be empowered to use the foreign currency counterpart funds . obtained under American foreign aid programs , to help in the dissemination of world scientific information and for other scientific projects overseas . All of which acids up into an interesting package of ideas which Senator 's McClellan and Humphrey arc willing to have examined in forthcoming committee hcarincs.                 @ @ @ @
