In London last week , the Most Rev. and Rt . Hon. Geoffrey Francis Fisher , Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of All England , was making a speech to his bishops and clergy . In the rich voice with which he dominated the radiocast of the coronation , the archbishop was ranging through the state of Christianity around the world when ears suddenly pricked to what sounded like fighting words-not against enemies of religion but against the Roman Catholic Church . <P> " I would mention a booklet to be published this week by S.P.C.K. the Anglican ' Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge entitled Infallible Fallacies , ' " said the archbishop . " Roman Catholics in this country and wherever churches of the Anglican Communion exist have , as the booklet says , for some time past intensified their propaganda . . . We of the Anglican Communion . . . hate attacking another Christian body as much as many Roman Catholics deplore the constant attacks of their own church upon ours . But these attacks do call for occasional answers . . . and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " <P> If Roman Catholics and Anglicans thought this was strong stuff to be coming from the top prelate of the Church of England , they opened their eyes wide when they turned to the pamphlet . Infallible Fallacies , by " Some Priests of the Anglican Communion , " is a closely reasoned piece of polemic in a venerable but almost forgotten tradition . Samples : <P> " The doctrinal errors of the Roman Church are a formidable obstacle in the path of any great movement of Anglicans towards the Roman Church ... The Infallibility of the Pope ... is perhaps the most obviously unscriptural and erroneous of these new doctrines . . . And the fact that there have been so few ' infallible ' utterances of the Pope ( and so much argument by Roman Catholics as to how many there have been-the estimates vary between three and nine ) leads to the conclusion that the doctrine really is nonsense . " <P> " Although this iniquitous practice of selling indulgences directly has been discontinued , the Roman Church still makes huge profits out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alms which are encouraged when indulgences are sought , and by the sale of rosaries and other ' indulgenced ' articles . Few Anglican priests would care to become involved in such wholesale exploitation of simple people 's credulity . " <P> " The great bureaucratic system of the Roman Catholic Church , centralized in Rome and tightly controlled by the Pope , is totalitarian . The transition from one kind of totalitarianism to another is an easy one . and it is well known that the countries of Western Europe in which Communism is strongest today are the predominantly Roman Catholic countries .
