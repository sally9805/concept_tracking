People with an unsatisfied will-to-believe have been getting solace from Novelist Kenneth Roberts ' Henry Gross and His Dowsing Rod . It tells with plenty of " evidence " how a good old state of Maine character , Henry Gross , finds " veins of water " by means of his good old divining rod. + In the latest issue of Harper 's magazine , which likes to publicize pseudo-scientific fancies ( e.g. , Eric Larrabee 's piece on the passing planets ) , and also to knock them down , waterworks Engineer Thomas M. Riddick gives an engineer 's explanation of water dowsing . <P> In places where dowsers thrive , says Riddick , there is water almost everywhere . It does not exist as " veins " but in saturated sand or gravel called the " water table . " Certain special conditions , such as sand so fine that it can not be filtered , or hard rock near the surface , make well-digging undesirable . A dowser who is worth his salt can avoid such hostile spots without magical assistance . Anywhere else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . <P> Engineer Riddick wastes little time on Henry 's theory that water rises from great depths underground and distributes itself in veins ( it actually comes from rain , streams , etc. ) , but he hopes that people will not put too much faith in shallow , dowser-found wells . Heavy pumping can drain them dry when most needed , he warns , and many are contaminated . <P> <P> + Unlike some temperamental dowsers who use only hazel sticks , Henry says he can work with any kind of forked stick , with grass , wire , or even old corset stays .
