When the U.S. DC-6 bearing Secretary of State John Foster Dulles appeared over Don Muang Airport one afternoon last week , Thailand 's Prime Minister Pibulsonggram was still fretfully edging his way through Bangkok traffic in his Ford Thunderbird . Informed by the airport tower , the pilot of the Dulles plane circled for seven minutes until the Prime Minister thundered onto the field . Bangkok was a courtesy call for Dulles : there were no critical problems to be ironed out . After he departed the next day ( Pibulsonggram and the Thunderbird were late for the goodbye ) only three of the eight Thai language papers mentioned his visit . <P> Reassuring &; Wooing . In Dulles ' 20-day , ten-country tour of Asia , none of the calls could be called urgent ; the Secretary 's purpose was not to seek or to make new commitments but to explain U.S. policy , reassuring friends and wooing neutrals . He worked hard and well at the job . <P> At the meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council of Foreign Ministers in Karachi , Dulles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military and economic legs . In New Delhi he sought to convince Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that the U.S. is not a warmonger and would like to be a closer friend to India . In Djakarta ( where the Times of Indonesia had declared only a few weeks earlier : " That man should be kept out of here , by force if necessary " ) Dulles ' car was heckled by youths who cried , " Down with SEATO ! " But when he left , after inviting Prime Minister Achmed Soekarno to visit the U.S. , most Indonesian circles - even the Times-seemed to feel that his visit was eminently successful . <P> In Manila , where Dulles announced that the U.S. will build its atomic research center for Asia in the Philippines , he left behind elation and renewed morale . In Taipei and in Seoul he held friendly conferences with Formosa 's Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and with Korea 's President Syngman Rhee . In sensitive Japan he carefully went through Japanese immigration procedures , had his passport stamped , and spoke of the " relationship of peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was clear that John Foster Dulles thawed some of the coolness where thawing was needed , e.g. , in India and Indonesia , and stoked some of the warmth where it needed to be stoked . <P> Opportunities &; Dangers . But these are times when more than thawing and stoking is needed . The sob-punctuated speech of Communist Party Boss Nikita Khrushchev ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) threw new light on a critical area of weakness in the Soviet system . To exploit the opportunities offered by that weakness , the U.S. needs , more than ever , a bold , imaginative , skillful foreign policy . <P> It is also apparent that while the Secretary of State was traveling in the Far East , new dangers for U.S. policy were arising in the Middle East and in North Africa . There was uneasiness in a number of the world 's capitals about whether Dulles ' State Department was organized and administered well enough to meet those problems as they should be met .
