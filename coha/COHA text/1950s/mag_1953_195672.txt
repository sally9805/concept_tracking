Fletcher Henderson , a man who not only wrote but played swing music before Benny Goodman , got attention from two big labels last week , four months after his death . On a Decca LP called The Fletcher Henderson Memorial Album , the bandleader-arranger takes his band ( vintage 1933-34 ) through eight breezy tunes . Most famed : It 's the Talk of the Town , Wrappin ' It Up , Down South Camp Meetin ' . Four stars who helped make the band famous-Saxophonists Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter , Clarinetist Buster Bailey and Trumpeter Allen-play some sizzling solos . <P> Benny Goodman Presents Fletcher Henderson Arrangements ( Columbia ) is a more exciting performance , largely because of the supercharging of the Goodman ensemble . The disk is more than a sentimental gesture : Henderson 's arrangements were the hard core of the Goodman library , gave the band its distinctive character . Standouts : Honeysuckle Rose , Henderson Stomp . <P> Other new pop records : <P> The Magnificent Marion MacPartland ( Savoy LP ) . English-born Pianist MacPartland puts out her jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each in a mood as distinct as its title : Limehouse Blues is fast and fantastic , Hallelujah wild and gay , Moonlight in Vermont cool and wistful . <P> <P> On Your Toes ( Portia Nelson , Jack Cassidy ; orchestra and chorus conducted by Lehman Engel ; Columbia LP ) . The 1936 Broadway musical , revived on records . Particularly welcome for reviving two of Broadway 's sweetest songs : Quiet Night and Glad to Be Unhappy . <P> Woody Herman Goes Native ( Mars LP ) . Swing Bandleader Herman is part proprietor of this comparatively new label , which features recordings of his own outfits . This one concentrates on tricky Calypso rhythms , juggled with virtuosity . <P> Body and Soul ( George Shearing Quintet ; M-G-M ) . Pianist Shearing has his sophisticated moments with this oldtimer , but the top kicks come from Jean Thielemans ' mellow harmonica playing . <P> Heap Big Heat ( Buddy Morrow Orchestra ; RCA Victor ) . Basically just an old rhythm cliche-a slow drag with a solid thump-but Morrow gives it a rousing treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol ) . A tear-dripper in which Frankie Sinatra promises to be loyally standing by on his false love 's wedding day . <P> Moanin ' Low ( Libby Holman ; Decca Curtain Call Series ) . A nostalgic reissue of Torch Singer Holman wailing one of the most memorable blues songs of 1929 . <P> Oo What You Do to Me ( Patti Page ; Mercury ) . Patti Page , back to Topic A , after proving , in a song about a doggie in a window , , that she can make a hit without appealing to any fundamental instinct whatever . Bound for the bestseller lists . <P> <P> Uska Dara ( Eartha Kitt ; Victor ) . Uska Dara ( Uskiidar ) is a town in Turkey , and this harem-style number reports some of the local color . Songstress Kitt , once played Istanbul , tackles the Turkish lyrics with enthusiasm , explains them in a couple of English interludes . <P> Sorry , Baby , You Let My Love Get Cold ( Peggy Lee ; Decca ) . A chilly rejection of an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Songstress Lee gave to Why Do n't You Do Right ?
