Crowds queued up last week along Manhattan 's West 52nd Street in front of the ANTA Theater , which houses neither a fluffy comedy nor a roaring musical , but a somber , free-verse reworking of the Book of Job . Poet Archibald MacLeish 's J.B. ( TIME , Dec. 22 ) was booked onto Broadway with scant attention from theater-party givers and a skimpy advance sale of $46,000 . On top of that it ran into the truly Jobian trial of New York 's newspaper strike , which muffled the critics ' unanimous raves . Yet when news about J.B. did spread , via TV , radio and word of mouth , its theme of modern man 's agony must have touched responsive chords . By last week J.B. was one of the hottest tickets in town , and requests for seats are pouring in by mail at a rate of nearly 500 a day . Advance sales have zoomed to $250,000 , and weekly profits top $10,000 ; the play will earn back its $125,000 production cost in about three months . <P> Another poet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . London 's Old Vic , in its first New York appearance since 1956 , performed to near capacity crowds every night ( Hamlet , Twelfth Night , Henry V ) . The troupe expects to wind up its 25-week U.S. tour next month with total grosses of $1,200,000 . And British Actor Sir John Gielgud , in a one-man tour de force ( see THEATER ) , nearly filled the 1,300-seat 46th Street Theater nightly with recitations from Shakespeare 's plays and sonnets , grossed $30,000 his first week .
