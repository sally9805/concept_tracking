In the waters outside the harbor of Rangoon , loaded ships lay at anchor . Out at sea other Rangoon-bound vessels got orders to alter course . Along Strand Road , Rangoon 's wharfside thoroughfare , government officials , merchants and shipping agents found themselves confronted everywhere by the cause of the distress . In warehouses , on docks , even in the port health station , thousands of bags of cement were piled high , crowding out all else and paralyzing the port . And more cement was on its way . <P> Burma was learning the hard way about barter deals with the Communists . Caught with a huge rice surplus and unable to sell enough of it elsewhere ( the U.S. is unloading a surplus of its own ) . Burma sent trade delegates to Iron Curtain countries to barter . They were eager amateurs who knew little about the fine points of trade , could not even speak Russian , and had to settle for whatever exchange goods they could get . Iron Curtain countries had plenty of cement to offer ; cement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burma 's projected construction program . So , without consulting Rangoon , they ordered a whopping 124,000 tons of cement from Russia , Czechoslovakia and East Germany . In their enthusiasm they somehow forgot that 1 ) no major construction is going on in Burma now , 2 ) Burma produces 60% of her own cement , 3 ) there is not room for that much cement in Rangoon . <P> Some 50,000 tons have already arrived in the port , and ships are standing offshore with more , waiting for berths . Rangoon 's ordinary shipping trade has all but halted , and demurrage charges are mounting at the rate of $4,200 a day . Soon harbor authorities will face an even worse problem . With the beginning of the monsoon season , the steady downpour of rain will wet much of the uncovered cement and convert it into solid mass.
