The Ruin of Soul A Story by Leonard Wallace Robinson . Drawings by Iry S. Doktore F OR two months after his arrival at the parish of the Sacred Heart , Father James was totally engrossed and nearly always calm and happy . The strange and dark misery which had threatened again and again to overwhelm his spirit , since the death of his father two years before , had lifted . From the first day of residence the incomprehensible , the insistent and terrible thoughts which he had been prey to , which rose on dark wings from hidden parts of his mind , now seemed to have fled forever . The unbidden ideas had been manifold and diverse , but the most persistently frightening , when it had come , had been specific , revolving around dreadful fantasms in which great , sharp cutting edges of blades , profusions of them , flashing , blinding , haunted his appalled mind . At such moments he would start to shake with an inexplicable ague , causing him to call upon God in a storm of aspirations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being suggested , clearly enough , by the devil , that dreadful and ever-present scourge who haunted the mind of man ) . Then the young priest would call upon all the hosts of heaven with such imperative terror that his prayers themselves soon seemed to him objurgations , exclamations of angry pain , the wrong voice , surely , to lift to the all-merciful Father . Such emotional outbursts within him had been invariably followed by a crippling migraine headache which lasted for two or three days . The first sight , then , that Father James had of his pastor at the Sacred Heart , Father Flynn , had filled him at once with a sense of peace and well-being which , in the seminary , had become almost unknown to him . On the day he took residence the young priest had come out from a retreat-house twenty miles away from Manton , traveling by bus and then walking from Manton square . He found the pale brick parish house next to the dark redbrick church . He was at once introduced to his new quarters by Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , and cold-. faced woman with a mouth pulled downward , originally by her nature and latterly by poor dentures , into a thin crescent ; the bristling militancy of her poorness of spirit showing perennial disapproval of those who did not share it . At the front door she gave him a depressed smile in acknowledgment of his self-introduction and an impersonal " Come with me . " After showing him his small top-floor cubicle , indicating wordlessly the facts that the bed was where it was and the washstand was where it was , she went to the window and pointed out . " Father 's out there , " she said , and then , without waiting for anything further , she left the room , closing the door silently behind her . The young priest put his black valise on the bed , pausing a moment uncertainly . Then he went to the window and looked out . He saw below him a large backyard filled with boys playing football . At one end of the yard , watching a scrimmage , stood , he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pale man of about sixty in a dark overcoat , black hat , and black wool gloves which he clapped together occasionally to warm his hands . He was smiling so intently and so pleasantly at the group that Father James looked back to the boys . They had just finished a rush and were in a pile which was slowly disentangling itself . As the mass of arms and legs came apart , lie saw at the bottom a form , smaller than the rest , clinging desperately to the ball . Then Father James looked back to Father Flynn , who , at this revelation , threw back his head and laughed . Then he blew a whistle and the boys came to where he was standing . Father James saw him pick up the little boy who had been on the bottom of the pile and laughingly lift him into the air by the elbows for a moment , and he followed this , before putting the child down , with a hearty hug . At this point he started to talk to the other boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait to go down to meet his pastor . A ND nothing he had learned since had changed his mind ; not for the first two months anyhow ; not till Father Jonas arrived . Everything Father James did with and for the pastor partook of the charm and the pleasure and the tenderness of the first sight of him . The young priest had never believed that he could work so hard , or , after he had learned the facts , had he understood how Father Flynn had been able to do the entire work of the parish by himself during the six weeks he 'd been alone ; for Father Moriarty , his assistant , had been on loan that long to St. Mary 's on the West Side . Father James was up at 4:00 A. M. for the 5:30 mass and he did not get to bed until after midnight seven days a week . Father Flynn tried to protest but the young priest , made bold by his chance to show his devotion , as well as by the logic of the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must let me do it . You 've been doing it for six weeks and Fm thirty years younger than you . " " I 'm afraid you 'll overdo yourself , " the older priest protested , but he did not push the issue . Even the things which , in the seminary , Father James felt he would never be able to do ( chiefly the work with women ) , while often filled with aching embarrassment for him , were not so bad . Father Flynn had made him feel all right about his blushing after the first meeting of the women 's sodalities . " Look , " he said , " Timothy . I know you 're worried about that blushing . I was when I started . But do n't let it worry you . If anybody should happen to notice it , which they wo n't , it would do nothing but make the sodalities a lot more popular than they are . What you do n't know is that the women consider it only in the correct order of things . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the handling of the boys between ten and sixteen . He never had been able to play any sport at all and he felt he would never be able to discover and learn the language of young boys . What he found out at once , however , was that the problem was imaginary ; they were only interested in discovering and learning his language and getting his approval . And , in his relief , he could be lavish with approval . Their acceptance of him was so complete and so clear then that his popularity became a source spring of profound joy to him . And Father Flynn said the right thing here , too . " Father James , " he said , " I 'm an old man and if you 're to steal my boys from me like you 're doing with the rest of my parishioners , then you should warn me of your intentions so I may prepare my spirit . " The young priest 's face reddened and he laughed . " Oh , I do n't think --  " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry . I 'll still have my books and Mrs. Humphrey . But I think you 'd better let me handle that football team myself today . I could n't stand losing it . " But of course he did n't even come out to watch the practice . He left it all to Father James . It was a complete surprise , then , to Father Flynn to get still another assistant . " The phone call came through from Monsignor yesterday . He 's an old friend and he wanted me to know before I heard officially , " he told Father James , the thin gray eyebrows lifted in surprise . " Of course I suspected that Father Moriarty was n't coming back . And he is n't . He 'll be at St. Mary 's permanently now . It did no good for me to tell the Monsignor that we were doing fine . He told me that the Bishop insisted I have still another assistant . " He paused for a moment and shook his head . " Ah , they move so quickly nowadays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father Jonas arrived as expected on Tuesday and Father James met him briefly at lunch . The new assistant talked easily and most of the lunch was given over to a quizzing by the pastor on the doings of personalities connected with the life at the seminary he had left so recently . They laughed often but the feeling of slight illness which Father James had felt growing during the meal seemed to prevent him from breaking through his diffidence to join them . The slight illness grew rapidly and by four that afternoon he was compelled to leave the football field and go to his room . His temperature was as high as he suspected and when Mrs. Humphrey suggested Dr. O'Brien he complied at once for he could feel also the constriction of his neck muscles which , in the past , had often signalled the onset of one of his migraines . Dr. O'Brien whose face glowed redly against his pure white hair was friendly but noncommittal . He said that Father James must stay in bed . He might be able to get up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two being the outside limit . After the doctor left , Father Flynn came in with Father Jonas . " Ah , " he said , " Timothy . " And he smiled down at the pale face of the priest on the narrow cot in the narrow room . " It 's sure that God works in a mysterious way . Here areyou , down from overwork I have no doubt of it , and here is Father Jonas right on the spot to take up your burdens from the very day you fall sick and relieve you of worry . " Father James now really looked at the new priest for the first time . He was a short man , stout but compact , burly , with an energy which seemed almost unmanageable , showing now in the violent pleasantness of his smile : when he spoke it was as if he were exercising enormous restraint to keep the boom out of his voice , like , thought Father James , a quarterback constrained to call signals in a whisper . " Do n't you worry , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " " Yes , " said the pastor . " Father Jonas is carrying on fine . No worry , Timothy . That 's an order . All you have to do is get well . " He smiled again and Father James held down the small panic that wanted to rise in him by fixing on the kindness and the understanding in his pastor 's smile . He wanted to sound hearty in his reply . " I 'll be better soon , " he said , " do n't you two worry , " but his voice and its content sounded fragile and childlike to himself and from somewhere inside him came an impalpable flash of memory , his father and his older brother in all their self-sureness , their unequable maturity . A bitterness , and a fear of it , moved inside him after their visit , but he held these feelings down with aspirations . It was not , then , till the late afternoon of the next day that he really faced the frightening time which lay ahead of him . Overnight it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast , told him that Father Flynn had had the backyard flooded so the boys could skate . At three-thirty in the afternoon he heard their voices . He had been told not to get up at all and for a while he fought his impulse to go to the window , but at length he could not resist it . His legs were so weak that his knees buckled as he moved and he had to hold onto the bed , then the table , then the window sill . Below flashed bright reds and greens : the boys were playing hockey . And , in their midst , on skates , violent in pursuit of the puck , the boys after him in wild but hopeless chase he was so much the best skater , was Father Jonas . The onset of Father James ' migraine , a real one now and terrible , was immediate . T HE next seven days were a journey through pain unimaginable to him before . All that had seemed frightening and unendurable within his mind before he had met Father Flynn rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Dreams of huge violence were followed by waking hours of fear where visions of great blades attacking him could not be exorcised by the most passionate prayer : and the sleep would come again with dreams of pursuit or , sometimes , and worse , of aloneness in a universal desert . And then he would wake again with the raging pain in his head and along the top of his spine . But in time again the guttering windless sweeping of the emotions subsided slowly and , on the eighth and ninth days , the power of his praying gradually asserted itself again and the devil seemed unable to keep up the fight . He got up on the tenth day and Mrs. Humphrey , coming in with his breakfast , almost managed to look pleased to see him sitting on the edge of the bed fully clothed . " Ah , then , " she said , " you 'll be all right for the Christmas dinner on Thursday . It will be in Father Flynn 's quarters . Special . " " Oh , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work tomorrow . By Thursday I 'll even be able to help you make the dinner . " But Dr. O'Brien would hear nothing about going back to work , and , only on Wednesday evening , did he give permission for the young priest to leave his room to attend the pastor 's Christmas dinner , on the promise that he 'd go back to bed as soon as it was over . " But if I 'm going to dinner I 'll want to say MasS , " said Father James . " Oh yes , " said Dr. O'Brien , and he reflected for a moment . " You 'll have to get permission to say an early one and then get back in bed till dinner . And then right back into bed after dinner . Mind me now ? " " Yes , doctor , I will , " said Father James . The dinner was for two on Christmas afternoon and at one o'clock Mrs. Humphrey knocked on Father James ' door and informed him that he had an hour to prepare . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his room , putting on his black coat , he thanked the Lord for His bounty . And he knelt before the varnished bureau and said three Hail Marys . Rising he looked at himself . Thecomplete pallor lie had had since childhood seemed greater than ever . He looked at the large brown eyes , bending over the bureau toward the mirror , pulling the skin down underneath them . Perfectly clear now . He thought of the numberless times he had done this with his whole head throbbing , almost bursting , looking at the blood-gorged veins suffusing the white , looking and looking into his own eyes in the mirror as if he could outstare the very nature of agony , face it down , destroy it , intoning over and over to himself the prayer , " Oh , Prince of the Heavenly Host , by the power of God , drive into hell Satan and the other evil spirits who wander through the world seeking the ruin of souls . " If only , he now thought , in this prayer he had been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain ; not implore the Lord for that ; if only he could use his suffering to understand pain , to know its dreadful challenge and thus , in His image , come closer to man the sufferer , perhaps even dare to hope that his own suffering would save others . W HEN the green alarm clock on the bureau pointed to five minutes to two he left his room and came down the wooden stairs which led to the second floor where Father Flynn had his quarters . Now he watched himself minutely , on guard against the incursion of any thought which might be hostile to his happy feeling . Unlike the bare hall of the third floor a soft blue carpet covered the corridor here and he stood for a moment , allowing himself to feel the security this rich covering brought to him . He walked along it then . He came to the door , the brown paneled door , which led to Father Flynn 's quarters , and he remembered , just in time , to touch the wall before he touched the brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small spark of static electricity which , on cold winter days , was generated by movement along the carpet runner . Instead of a spark , however , a tiny- fragment of a dream he had had ( was it only the night before ? ) leapt into his mind as he touched the enscrolled metal knob . and he clutched the knob not turning it . In the dream he was pursued , they were people like gangsters , dark-skinned , and they were after him for having killed one of them , a bad man , a wicked man ; he felt his legs heavy and ponderous in the dream , almost like false legs , like wooden legs , moving him far too slowly ; and the criminals moved behind , devils in the shape of men sure of their prey . By squeezing the door knob fiercely and by clamping downward and inward on himself with every muscle of his body till he was as rigid as steel and by staring fixedly at nothing straight ahead of him , he was able to shut out both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was one with the image . He could not be sure how long he held himself in his trance-like position , but as he came out of it he could feel his legs were weak , really quite pleasantly weak , the rememberance of the dream gone and his mind , militant and triumphant , filled with the Divine Praises : " Blessed be God ; Blessed be the great Mother of God , Mary most holy ; Blessed be St. Joseph , her most chaste spouse ; Blessed be God in His Angels and in His Saints . " H E TURNED the knob and pushed open the door and the room seemed to reach out for him with reassurance and joy ; it was bright with holly , the bay windows framed wreathes , three tall candles burned in a silver candelabra on a table in the bay , and another table in the center of the room was set with the best napery and silverware of the parish house . Father Flynn stood with his back to the fireplace . His white hair caught some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a glass of brown liquor . He hardly raised his voice as he spoke but the warmth of his greeting fell across the young priest like a blessing . " Merry Christmas , Timothy , " said Father Flynn . This was still among the few times that his pastor had used his first name in addressing him . Father James felt as one who had come through great mysterious spaces of agony to this happy moment and he was afraid for a moment that a desire to weep might overpower him . He managed to reply cheerfully , however . " A very Merry Christmas to you , Father , " said the young priest . " Well , " said Father Flynn , " are you against blessing the occasion with a small schnapps ? " He smiled his restrained , tight , knowing smile . " Why , no , " said the young priest . " I guess not . " " Help yourself , then , my boy , " said the pastor . He pointed to an end of the set table where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked him and walked over slowly to the table and poured himself a glass of the whiskey . He looked at his superior uncertainly . " The best to you , my boy , " said Father Flynn and he raised his glass , " and good health once more . " " Thank you , " said Father James , " and the same to you , sir . " He took a deep drink and nearly choked but this discomfiture was covered by the opening of the brass-handled door . " Ah , " said the pastor , " our other guest . Merry Christmas , Father Jonas . " Father James automatically put down the flicker of feeling that Father Flynn had not called the other priest by his first name too . He was hardly aware of the movement of his mind to repress this illicit emotion , and as he felt the liquor reaching down safely past his throat he called out in a voice just slightly louder than usual : " Merry Christmas , Father Jonas . " Father Jonas stood in the doorway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both , looking at one and then at the other . " Well , " he said at last , his short , capable-looking arms akimbo . " This is a Feast Day , is n't it . Liquor and all . " Father Flynn laughed , letting a drop of liquor spill from his glass , and he motioned the newcomer toward the decanter : " Join us , join us , " he said , " the devil 's got the day off . " Father Jonas laughed and walked toward the liquor . " Will I have to go far to catch up with you , " he said and he winked at Father James , who , during the entire exchange , kept a fixed smile on his face . " No , no , " said Father Flynn . " We 're having the glass that cheers but does not intoxicate . " Father James glanced at him but saw no reproof in the pastor 's face at Father Jonas ' easy familiarity . They both watched Father Jonas pouring from the decanter , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel over the fireplace and rang it vigorously . " We might as well get started , " he said ; " Mrs. Humphrey will be straining at the leash . " When his pastor placed Father James to his right the happiness and security which , since he had entered the room , he had felt could return to him again with all its fullness wrapped him around completely . During the soup , a steaming plate of oxtail borne in on a silver tray by Mrs. Humphrey , he hugged the festive warmth to himself , appearing to listen to the conversation of the other two in smiling agreement but inwardly instead giving thanksgiving after thanksgiving to God . It was the mention of his name by the pastor and the attentive smile on the face of Father Jonas that suddenly fixed his true attention on the conversation , bringing him back from his private world sharply . The pastor was smiling at him too . " Do n't you think so , Father James ? " his superior asked . " Oh , " said Father James in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What ? " He could feel himself blushing and he looked down at his plate . " I 'm afraid I was n't following too closely . " Father Flynn was reassuring . " It was nothing important , " he said , " I just remarked to Father Jonas that since you 're up and about again and the Christmas rush is over , we 'll have to divide the labors on a more or less definite basis now , according to the bents you two have . I remarked , I believe , that Father Jonas ' undeniable talents " ( he turned a smile of kindly irony on the stout priest , pausing for a moment He turned full face then to Father James . " Your talents , on the other hand , seem to be in dealing with the women . Do you think I 've observed accurately ? " v ATHER JAMES first felt the tremor in his fingers and he knew that a red stain on his cheeks was deepening , spreading ra-pidly down to his neck ; the eyes of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mocking him . He could barely mutter a " Yes , Father , " in answer . His hands seemed to be growing , the nerves in them to be springing into independent life . " Then we 're agreed , " the pastor went on . " I think we will try Father Jonas on athletics , the men 's sodality , the boys ' Sunday school , and things of that order ; and we 'll give you the more onerous duties of visiting the sick , the girls ' Sunday school , the ladies ' sodalities ; the really difficult parochial burdens . " , Under the table Father James ' , hands clenched in an effort to gain control . He could feel the large pains starting across his neck . His smile , through the incandescent redness of his face , remained fixed , but he had only a dim vision of Mrs. Humphrey entering the room , setting the turkey before Father Flynn and silently departing . Only , brilliantly and clearly , he saw his superior pick up the carving knife which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting edge gleamed and he could feel now the large muscles of his body pick up the spasmodic rhythms of his twitching hands , and now no clamping down , no clenching inward , no ecstatic rigidity could keep the monstrous grief from bursting outward . The two men did not notice the onset of the seizure until the moment that the aspiration , the strangulated prayers for help and for control , began to be audible . " Blessed be God , Blessed be God , Blessed be God , " mumbled Father James . His pastor glanced at him sharply , and then in alarm , and as he did so the young priest stood up as though to flee , but he could not , and the words became louder and louder mounting to a despairing wail , finally a wordless cry , as the fit overcame him fully and he fell forward , heavily , to the ground . He lay rigid and silent now , oblivious to the frightened faces of the two men who leaned toward him in horror , their napkins clutched against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
