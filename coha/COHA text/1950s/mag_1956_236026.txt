The hymns of the Qumran sect , now completely translated and accessible to the layman for the first time , give readers an authentic feeling of what the scrolls are like . They also offer a moving insight into an ancient mode and mood of worship as well as haunting echoes of Biblical psalms . Excerpts : <P> <P> Yea , I am in distress <P> as a woman in travail <P> bringing forth her firstborn , <P> when , as her time draws near , <P> the pangs come swiftly upon her <P> and all the grievous throes <P> that rack those heavy with child . <P> <P> For now , amid throes of death , <P> new life is coming to birth , <P> and the pangs of travail set in , <P> as at last there enters the world <P> the man-child long conceived . . . <P> Now , amid pangs of hell , <P> there will burst forth from the womb <P> that marvel of mind and might , <P> and that man-child will spring from the throes ! <P> <P> Delivery comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . <P> <P> Crafty men are they ; <P> they think base thoughts , <P> see Thee with heart divided , <P> stand not firm in Thy truth . <P> In their every thought is a root <P> which blossoms to wormwood and gall . <P> <P> In the stubbornness of their hearts <P> they wander astray <P> and go seeking Thee through idols . . . <P> They have paid no heed to Thy teaching , <P> nor given ear to Thy word , <P> but have said of the vision of knowledge , <P> ' It is not sure , ' <P> and of the way Thou desirest , <P> ' There is no such thing . ' <P> But Thou , O God , wilt give them their answer , <P> judging them in Thy power <P> for all their idolatrous acts <P> and their manifold transgressions , <P> to the end that they shall be caught <P> in their own designs <P> who have turned away from Thy covenant . <P> Thou wilt sentence all men of deceit <P> to be cut off , <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . <P> <P> I shall say unto God : <P> ' Thou , for me , art the Right ! ' <P> and unto the Most High : <P> ' For me Thou art cause of all good ! ' <P> Fountain of all knowledge , <P> Spring of holiness , <P> Zenith of all glory , <P> Might omnipotent , <P> Beauty that never fades . . . <P> <P> Whenever I first put forth my hand or foot , <P> I will bless His name ; <P> when first I go or come , <P> when I sit and when I rise , <P> when I lie down on my couch , <P> I will sing unto Him . <P> At the common board , <P> or ever I raise my hand <P> to enjoy the rich fruits of the earth <P> with that which flows from my lips <P> I will bless Him as with an oblation . <P> <P> At the onset of fear and alarm <P> or when trouble and stress are at hand , <P> I will bless Him with special thanksgiving <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mercies alway , <P> and come thereby to know <P> that in His hand lies the judgment of all living , <P> and that all His works are truth .
