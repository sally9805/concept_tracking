President Carlos Castillo Armas and his wife were to dine alone one night last week in the block-long Presidential Palace in Guatemala City . Not even one of the wiry President 's military aides was present as the couple strolled arm in arm down the long , wide hallway from their bedroom apartment to the dining room . Only the crack Presidential Guards stood duty in the series of archways that led to the courtyard gardens . <P> As the couple passed by , one sentry , a stocky half-Indian named Romeo Vsquez Snchez , snapped his heels together at attention , slapped his rifle up to present arms . Then Soldier Vsquez Snchez stepped back , flipped off one set of hall lights , and raised his 7-mm . Mauser to his shoulder . As the President half-turned , Vsquez Snchez shot him through the heart . Doughty Castillo Armas , 42 , who overthrew the only Communist-dominated government that the Western Hemisphere ever had , died at once . <P> The guard fired another round into the President 's body , then fled toward the palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another at a colonel of the guards ( neither was hit ) . As his former comrades in arms rushed up from all sides , Vsquez Snchez put the rifle muzzle to his throat and fired the last bullet of his five-round clip upward through his own skull . <P> <P> The Legacy . Behind him , the little ( 5 ft. 7 in. , 135 Ibs . ) President left prosperity and surface stability , but no sound political philosophy , organization or heir apparent . In the three years since his rag-tag army and Nicaragua-based air force ( six F-47s ) forced out the Red-led regime of Jacobo Arbenz Guzmn , Castillo was the country 's undisputed ruler-shy and diffident in manner , often indecisive as an administrator , but capable on occasion of moving with stern severity . <P> The product of a poor family , the country 's military academy , and the U.S. Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth , Kans. , he cracked down relentlessly on Communism , which he had learned to hate as a career officer . He had seen Communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to head off the rigged election of Arbenz in 1950 , he faced a firing squad ; luckily hit only in the left leg , he returned to prison , helped dig a 38-ft. tunnel under the walls , and escaped to begin the plot that took Guatemala . With the aid of ten separate police forces , he jailed or exiled the Arbenz cronies who had not already fled the country , cleaned up Red-led unions . But he also closed down opposition newspapers , which Arbenz had never done , and brutally smashed student demonstrations .
