When redheaded Paul C. ( for Clifford ) Smith became editor of the San Francisco Chronicle 15 years ago , he was the wonder boy of journalism . Only 29 , Editor Smith soon cured the ailing Chronicle , broadened its horizon to include columns heavy with culture , foreign news and features . He picked up new readers steadily , experimented with such ideas as departmentalizing the news , developed a staff studded with columnists and breezy local writers . During World War II , he resigned from the Navy , after serving as a lieutenant commander , to enlist as a private in the Marines , did combat duty in the Pacific and came out a lieutenant . Then he went back into the Navy on active duty as a full commander . <P> Bachelor Smith 's showplace home , high on San Francisco 's Telegraph Hill , became a gathering place for West Coast visiting bigwigs and intellectuals . To San Franciscans , Smith and the Chronicle were as inseparable as ham &; eggs . Once 40,000 names on a petition urged him to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputes to mediate . Paul Smith , who stands 5 ft. 8 in. tall , had an eleven-word explanation for his success : " I 'm just a little squirt anxious to be a tough guy . " <P> A Refusal . By 1946 , he had brought the Chronicle to its peak ; daily circulation was up 58% ( to 169,000 ) , and the paper was running second only to Hearst 's Examiner . But when postwar newsprint and labor costs began climbing , the Chronicle , like other dailies , was hard hit . The price of the paper went up to 10 ; then Smith put into operation a plan , which with his usual flair , he called the " Theory of Foresight , " i.e. , expanding the coverage and staff to give the readers more for their money , even though earnings were skidding . <P> Last week Smith surprised all of San Francisco ; he resigned as editor of the Chronicle . The paper 's owners , he explained , refused to go along with his Theory of Foresight . Fortnight ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired 37 staffers while Smith was out of town . As soon as he heard the news , he hustled back with an ultimatum that either he would be consulted about such changes or he would leave . The feeling in the front office seemed to be that he had better leave . <P> Looking at the Bay . Paul Smith had been brought to the Chronicle as an editor in 1933 by his friend and patron , George T. Cameron , now 79 , whose wife is one of the four heirs to the paper . But by last week , George Cameron was no longer the only owner 's voice . His nephew , Charles Thieriot , 39 , was taking a more active interest in the Chronicle as boss of the paper 's TV station , and his younger brother , Ferdinand Peter Thieriot , 32 , was on the job as a circulation executive . The biggest stockholder of all , Nan Tucker McEvoy , 33 , George Cameron 's niece ( and wife of Reader 's Digest Editor Dennis McEvoy ) , was also taking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; on as a reporter . Newsmen had suspected that as their interest grew , Editor Smith would have had more &; more trouble running things his way . <P> Smith 's resignation left Publisher Cameron in the editor 's chair until he and the other members of the family can find a new editor . Smith 's own plans were indefinite . Said he : " I intend to sit and look at the bay for a while . "
