THE OLD TANKER RIDES AGAIN How that hard-boiled soldier , Major General Ernest Harmon , invaded the world of ivory towers and put a quiet little Vermont college back on the academic map . By Milton MacKaye There were smiles of friendly but amused incredulity when news got around that Maj. Gen. E. N. Harmon , one of the old Army 's roughest and readiest specimens , was about to exchange his battered and bullet-dented tanker 's helmet for a college president 's mortarboard . " Not Ernie , " said a three-star colleague of World War II . " I can see him doggedly driving the Second Armored Division seventy miles in a single night in the Ardennes , over strange roads , in snow and sleet , in total darkness . I can hear his rasping voice dressing clown a colonel whose carelessness or folly lost a bloody hill during the breakout at Anzio . But I can not see him juggling a delicate Haviland teacup at a faculty tea or , by the wildest stretch of the imagination , hear him addressing the board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernie . " Today the friendly skeptics stand confounded . General Harmon has been president of Norwich University in his boyhood state of Vermont since 1950 . Like the hell-for-leather cavalryman he once was , he has ridden roughshod over difficulties which would have unhorsed a less determined and less impervious man . And in a relatively short period of time he has revitalized and expanded a 138-yearold institution which , at the time of his advent , was , in the words of an alumnus , " standin ' in the need of prayer . " During the Harmon administration there has been a spectacular building program ; capital improvements have amounted to $3,847,000 . Academic standards have been raised , the quality of the faculty has been improved , student enrollment has increased until even new facilities are beginning to strain at the scams . A long-time friend of the university told me that never in his memory had school spirit been so high . That this is directly attributable to a sixty-three-year-old soldier with a chest full of medals , no one in New England educational circles doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Northfield , which is tucked into a neat fold of the Central Vermont hills . Norwich has been a military college since its beginnings , and it bears an ancient and honorable name . Capt . Alden Partridge , the founder , had the idea of preparing young Americans for the twofold function of the citizen soldier . In times of peace Norwich 's graduates have chosen such civilian occupations as engineering , the sciences , business and teaching . In times of war , they have been ready , available and trained . Partridge 's pattern of education is now shared by Norwich with seven other distinctly military colleges , many military preparatory schools and  --  the traditionalists of Norwich feel  --  with the ' 2,000,000 men who have gone through R.O.T.C. ( Reserve Officers Training Corps ) in colleges and universities scattered across the land . Tradition is priceless , but it does not meet deficits . Before Harmon 's arrival , many loyal alumni in Boston and New York despaired of the future of their hilltop alma mater . It was a private college with almost no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College of Vermont , " its main claim to tax support was a $200 scholarship for Vermont boys who chose to enroll there . After Pearl Harbor most of the student body and a good part of the faculty ( Continued on Page 56 ) 56 A new optimism about Norwich , the improved conditions , and , above all , a confidence in Harmon 's lighting spirit brought about faculty stabilization . In the period 1946-50 loss or turnover of faculty personnel averaged 331 , , per cent . This year it was 8 per cent . There has been steady improvement in professional attainment . It did not take an old field tactician long to learn that a Ph.D . in a college catalogue was as important as a bull's-eye on the target range . Ten years ago there were seven men with Ph.D . degrees on the faculty and twenty-three with master 's degrees . This year there are fifteen Ph.D . ' s and thirty-five masters ; young professors are encouraged , even pressed , to continue with postgraduate work . " I opposed the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head who won his degrees at Harvard and Johns Hopkins . " I admired him as a soldier , but thought him temperamentally unsuited to head a college . I was wrong , and 1 admit it . He has done a great deal to raise academic standards at Norwich and , after a lifetime of teaching here , I can be nothing other than grateful . " Norwich prides itself on being  --  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , of Troy , New York , amiably disputes the claim  --  the first American college ( 18211 to give courses in " civil " engineering as differentiated from military engineering . Despite this historic distinction , Norwich 's engineering courses were in trouble . Civil engineering alone had full accreditation from he Engineer 's Council for Professional Development . Mechanical engineering had a temporary accreditation and electrical engineering had lost its accreditation . Laboratories and physical equipment on the Norwich campus simply did not meet modern requirements . Norwich 's engineering departments are now fey accredited . Chemistry has been accredited by the American Chemical Society . All other courses are regionally accredited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laboratories and new buildings cost money  --  lots of money . Harmon , who was no businessman , abruptly Found himself in high finance . without a parachute . He had never sold so much as an aluminum pan or a set of 0 . Henry to a credulous housewife , but he was confronted with the job of selling a college and its aims to dissident alumni and to the men of wealth and the captains of industry who might be willing to help . The record shows he did pretty well . Never a public speaker by choice , he accepted engagements to speak at plush banquets , at Rotary and Kiwanis luncheons , at exclusive city clubs . Harmon mastered the skills of mendicancy and his present campus is the proof of it . Tompkins Hall , a mechanical-engineering building , was built in 1951 . The James Jackson Cabot Hall of Science was built in the autumn of 1952 . The college library , now the Henry Prescott Chaplin Memorial Library , was completely modernized in 1953 . Two additional dormitories went up at about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harmon Hall over the general 's protest  --  was finished in the summer of 1955 . During this same period $200,000 was spent on student recreational facilities , and $288,000 on major improvements to existing plant . Harmon on the trail of an almoner has become as single-minded as Fearless Fosdick . He also keeps his eyes and ears open for the cause . A weather station on the campus , about to be abandoned , was wheedled from the Federal Government , and , remodeled , is now the Ainsworth Infirmary . The riding hall , a memento of old cavalry days , sparked an idea . Why not enlarge it and refrigerate it ? When I was at Norwich the Taylor Memorial Hockey Arena , financed by gifts From alumni and the family of one of Norwich 's war dead , was nearing completion . And within fifteen minutes of the campus the crack Lybrand Ski Area  --  suitable for intercollegiate competition  --  had come into existence . It was the contribution of a man from Connecticut who summers in Northfield . Not long ago Harmon go1 wind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sequestered in a warehouse in Cambridge , Massachusetts . They had been brought to this country for the Chicago World 's Fair and then stored at Harvard . Since the early 1930 's they had been unheard and unrung ; Harvard either had carillon bells of its own or did n't want any . The.donor family was glad to pass them on to Norwich . Carillon bells need a tower , and this was provided by the widow of Dr. Porter H. Adams , president of Norwich 1933-39 , as a memorial to her husband 's mother , Jeannie Porter Adams . Such acquisitive instincts in a private individual might seem repulsive ; in a college president they constitute merit Indeed , the general sometimes maintains that his ability to classify potential donors and identify their genera has enabled him to reclassify the facets of his own character and to identify areas of improvement . " A good many unflattering descriptions have been appl ie. D me in my day , " Harmon said recently . " I have been called foolhardy . I have been called blustering , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Army , once paid me a high compliment . He said 1 was mean and tough enough to be a Siberian general . Currently I am a man of peace . " I think I have been foolhardy on only two occasions . One was long ago . Maj. Ralph Sasse was coaching football at West Point and I was detailed there as an assistant coach . Ralph and I went out for a winter walk and came to a frozen-over pond ; there was free water at the edge . ' Are you a man ? ' asked Ralph , and I saw what he meant . We stripped off our clothes , swam under the ice to the other shore , turned around and swam back again . " The other occasion ? Norwich had been given a **27;623;TOOLONG building , but nothing for equipment or maintenance . 1 gambled and ordered ninety-two thousand dollars ' worth of equipment without a nickel with which to pay for it . A week or so later I confessed my sins to an industrialist in New York . He paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doing . ' In the next thirty minutes I had a pleasant introduction to what is called ' pool giving . ' My friend got on the telephone , prefaced each request with give five thousand if you will , ' and raised sixty-five thousand dollars . With that head start , I liquidated the rest of the equipment debt without too much trouble . " Norwich during this academic year has 800 cadets . Their geographic origins are scrambled . Massachusetts leads the list with 279 students , and New York is second with 165 . Vermont is in third place with 131 , and the rest of the East is adequately represented . Thereafter the enrollment feathers off to a single student from many Western states and six foreign nations . Norwich once had a considerable Asiatic representation ; sixteen Chinese generals had their training at the hilltop . There is not much news about them at present . Some 40 per cent of the students are engineers ; the rest are rather evenly divided among business administration , aviation administration , economics and liberal arts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Godfrey Lowell Cabot , of Boston , a former president of the National Aeronautic Association . As early as 1935 , Doctor Cabot created the James Jackson Cabot Fund for aviation studies ; it was named for a son shot down over France in World War I. Much later , and with large additional gifts , Doctor Cabot provided for the support of the Department of Aviation Administration at Norwich and the ( Continued on Page 62 ) // ( Continued from Pagr 60 ) construction there of the Cabot Hall or Science . Aviation administration combines with a liberal-arts course practical trade-school training in the operation of commercial air lines and airports . Top air-lines executives of the nation arc represented on the board of advisors . Graduates immediately find jobs in the transportation industry . Incidentally , Norwich recently was selected by the Department of Defense as one of the colleges where Air R.O.T.C. students will get professional Air Force flight training . The Government will construct a new airfield there during the next few months , A composite picture of an average Norwich student is a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-class family of sonic prosperity . ( it costs a minimum of 8I500 a year to attend Norwich , ) He tends  --  in the words of a cadet captain  --  to be " an all-around guy . " That is , he likes outdoor activities and winter sports and can take books or let them alone : young intellectuals and specialists choose universities where their specialties are emphasized . The fact that he has chosen to attend a military college sheds some light on his personality ; few rebels or flaming individualists elect that kind of discipline . In physical appearance  --  except that he wears the Army uniform  --  the cadet has the same differences and the amazing sameness of all college boys . Few of the Norwich cadets expect to choose the Army as a career , but , with military service inevitably ahead of them in these times , they have chosen an education which may make them Army officers instead of Army privates , and equips them for a civilian profession later on . Norwich students may select their R.O.T.C. specialization in Armor , the Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  consisting at present of eight master sergeants of long experience and seven commissioned officers under a furl colonel  --  is assigned to the school by the Department of the Army . Graduates are eligible for appointment as second lieutenant in the Army Reserve Corps ; a limited number of cadets who have been designated as Distinguished Military Students are offered commissions in the Regular Army . Several buildings on the campus are named for early cadets . These include Admiral George Dewey , Spanish-American War hero , and Gen. Grenville M. Dodge , builder of the Union Pacific Railroad . Back in 1951 General Harmon played host to 8000 people when Norwich celebrated the centenary of Dodge 's graduation . Ransom Hall is named for Truman B. Ransom , second president of the university , who died before Chapultepee in the Mexican War . Ordered to capture the Heights there , Colonel Ransom is supposed to have said , " I will try . " For more than a century that has been the university 's motto . Norwich has the only Mountain and Winter Warfare R.O.T.C. unit . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of military training a week . These hours are spent not in warm classrooms , but in climbing mountains on skis and snowshoes when the temperature is zero or below . The climax of the course is a winter bivouac ; each student is required to carry in his rucksack all equipment necessary to sustain himself in deep snow and very cold weather , above timberline and below it . He climbs a minimum of 2000 feet vertical ascent and an over-all distance of from six to twelve miles ; he provides his own shelter and cooks his own meals , melts snow for water , finds wood for his fires . Some of Vermont 's highest mountains are near Norwich and temperatures drop on occasion to twenty-five below zero . About 100 cadets a year take this training . The Mountain and Winter Unit is especially close to General Harmon 's heart . Frequently , when the cadets go out on their frigid maneuvers , he told me , he remembers the rugged winter weather that made a frozen nightmare of the Battle of the Bulge . He is reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack was launched at dawn on Christmas Day , With thoughts of his own sons in mind  --  the three Harmon boys were then in the Army  --  the general climbed into his jeep and for many hours paid a series of visits at battleground stations to lend the Gls shivering in the open-the bleak comfort of knowing their commander was sharing the bitter weather with them . The New Look of the Norwich campus , the feeling that the school is " going places , " has produced a feeling of ' pride among cadets . Casual talks on the Campus , in dormitories and recreational rooms , convinced me that Harmon is tremendously popular with the student body , But the sailing was not always so smooth , There was real bitterness among fraternity men when Harmon issued an edict that all students must cat at the mess hall . Previously , fraternity members were permitted to take their meals in their off-campus houses . A compelling reason for the building of the Student Union was the fact that half of the students were nonfraternity men who had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income from a full mess hall was vital to the amortizing of the Union 's indebtedness . " That 's all over , " a senior fraternity man told me . " We all realize there was no alternative . As far as I personally am concerned , I put my university ahead of my fraternity . After a couple of classes graduate , no one will ever recall that the Greek-letter guys ever had those special privileges . " A. few years ago there was grumbling over the sports program . The football coach and the football team believed they were entitled to special privileges and relief from certain cadet drill requirements . Harmon did n't , and he got a new football coach . Norwich had a winning record this year after two arid seasons . Harmon likes football . He played in the same backfield with the great Elmer Oliphant at West Point . " My only job , " Harmon says deprecatingly , " was to block out the end so Oliphant could run . " But he believes in an athletic policy based on moderation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents have their share . He likes to schedule colleges with the same attitude . " We here at Norwich , " he told me , " believe that athletics are part of a student 's development , that they must take their place in balance with other activities . We are much more interested in developing intramural sports in which all can participate than in developing championship teams . We ca n't afford the championship policy and do n't believe in it . " Probably there is no other college in America so largely administered by its own student body as Norwich , General Harmon introduced the West Point honor system and students caught cribbing are promptly ejected . The corps of cadets has its own student officers , and the student officersare the disciplinary police in dormitories ; the administration has no proctors , no spies of its own , there at any time . Harmon is a thorough believer in the abilities and common sense of young Americans . At the Anzio breakout , in what might justifiably be described as his first trial run as an educator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G Is . " I decided , " he wrote in his memoirs , " that all troops of the First Armored should be told ' ' the detailed plan of attack . I was criticized by some commanders on the ground that I was taking chances with military security . Well , that was the issue  --  security versus understanding . Tank warfare is complex at its simplest , and , with my eyes open , I chose understanding . " Harmon and his staff did more than tell the troops the plan of attack . He had designed a fifty-foot-square relief map of the entire sector , showing every hill , stream , bridge , road , path  --  a map so detailed that even the color of rooftops was reproduced . A boardwalk was placed above the exhibit , and the business of graphic education began . Day after day the troops , in installments , came to study the relief map . Day after day , Harmon saw them using sticks and twigs as pointers , tracing the routes their units must pursue . In the subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that familiarity with terrain saved hundreds of lives , March 9 , 1957 The blustering , cussing , explosive trooper of the Italian campaign has been repressed and muted a little by his contacts with ivory towers , but not too much . In general , he leaves matters of curriculum and scholarship to his Ph.D . ' s , but not always . He handles a teacup as deftly as the next man , and the last evening 1 spent with him  --  shades of a thousand departed drill sergeants ! ? we saw a performance of Hamlet in the college armory . It is true the general had said good night before the final tattered group of actors expired onstage , but he , indubitably , was there . Entertaining at Lybrand House is gracious and informal under the supervision of the charming and gentle Mrs. Harmon , who does not choose to keep a servant . " Even Ernie 's worst enemies , " said a close friend , " worship the ground his wife walks on . " The vice of profanity is one with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision . The remodeling of an old building into the present beautiful White Memorial Chapel engaged the general greatly . In the process of shopping for church furniture in New York ecclesiastical-merchant marts , Harmon equipped himself with a considerable knowledge in a rather specialized field . " You 've taught me a totally new language , " he told a church expert . " You 've taught us a new one too , " said the expert . Almost from the beginning , the alumni of Norwich swung into solid support of Harmon 's program . Indeed , the new mechanical-engineering building , which cost $254,000 , was financed entirely by alumni gifts . It is named for Colonel Tompkins , who commanded a regiment in France in World War I  --  the same Colonel Tompkins who helped Harmon get his West Point appointment . His widow , bedfast , still lives in Northfield . Harmon 's board of trustees also supports him strongly . Chairman is Stanley C. Wilson , former governor of Vermont . There is room here to mention only a few of the thirty-one members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his grandson , Louis W. Cabot , whose bene factions in the public mind are more closely associated with Harvard . Another is William D. Hassett , wise and cultured secretary to both Presidents Roosevelt and Truman , who came back to his home town of Northfield when he retired from Government service . Another is William M. Lybrand , who presented to the school the Lybrand Ski Area and the handsome colonial residence in which president and Mrs. Harmon reside . Still another is J. Watson Webb , onetime polo player and retired New York Central executive with whom Harmon often goes hunting . In difficult years Webb 's contributions havehelped substantially to keep books balanced . A. Conger Goodyear , of Old Westbury , Long Island , first met General Harmon during the occupation of Germany . He has been generous in friendship , financial advice and gifts . This year or next the Goodyear Swimming Pool will make its appearance at Northticld . Harry W. Patterson , of Buffalo , New York , a wealthy engineering alumnus , came to Harmon 's rescue when the problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of royalty in oil wells he owned . When no one showed interest in the modernization of the college library , it was Henry P , Chaplin , a trustee from Windsor , Vermont , who footed the bill . Norwich 's problem is the problem of many small colleges and some big ones  --  insufficient endowment . The unrestricted endowment is only $322,000 . Last year it produced an income of only $13,000 . Two factory workers can earn as much on a forty-hour work week . The restricted endowment of 51335,000 can be used legally only for scholarships and other purposes specifically stated , and not for the university 's general support . The general , then , has played a dual role from the beginning : ( 1 ) the college president obliged to improve educational facilities ; ( 2 ) the boss of a marginal business who , like the manager of a chain store , must end every year in the black . So far , he has been able to walk the tightrope while waving both parasols . Sometimes Harmon has been able to combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register . Harmon , the chain-store manager , saw his campus comparatively idle in the summertime . Harmon , the educator , was acutely conscious of the fact that many students  --  particularly engineering students  --  were lost to Norwich because they flunked out in their first year . The reason was simple ; their high-school education in mathematics was insufficient to the demands of an engineering course . Two years ago General Harmon put a small advertisement in the educational section of a New York Sunday newspaper . Norwich offered not only remedial courses in reading  --  the plague of many colleges  --  but remedial courses in algebra , trigonometry and simple arithmetic . That summer Norwich had fifteen remedial students . Last summer it had sixty remedial students and a total of 145 students during the entire summer session . This coming summer preparations are being made for 250 students . Most of Norwich 's building program was financed by gifts . The university now has an indebtedness of $1,464,000 . Some $779,000 is owed to the Federal Government on a long-time loan at an interest rate of 2i4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two new dormitories now in use at Norwich . About $35,000 is owed on faculty housing , but that is being swiftly paid off . Amortization of the $650,000 loan on the Student Union building , obtained from a New England insurance company , is spread over twenty-five years ; income from the mess hall and the college store should take care of that . It seems to me , an objective observer , that high ingenuity and excellent management have been evident since General Harmon took over . Ingenuity and legerdemain are required to keep a college afloat when tuition carries the load . Tuition is now $725 and will go higher . This troubles Harmon . Once a poor boy himself , he has few scholarships to offer worthy youngsters with a bent For engineering and science . He is convinced that many more scholarships are necessary if the educational health of the university is to be preserved .
