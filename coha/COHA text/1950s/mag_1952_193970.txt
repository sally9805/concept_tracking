In June it began . All over the Union of South Africa , Negroes and Indians , some boldly but most of them timidly , were defying Jim Crow , boarding " white " buses , stepping up to counters reserved for whites in the post office , refusing to show their passes when accosted by the cops . As a nonviolent civil disobedience campaign , it owed its inspiration to Gandhi - but , often , in the background , it owed its guidance to Marx . In the minds of 2,500,000 whites , it stirred fears of what might happen if all of South Africa 's usually docile 10 million blacks , half-whites and browns came awake . <P> In the genteel Cape Province town of Grahamstown , 58 Negroes were jailed for walking in the streets after curfew ( 11 p.m . ) . In Pretoria , 20 singing Negroes and one Indian were arrested for marching into the " white " section of the railway station . Eight hundred nonwhites were in jail in East London ; 800 more in Port Elizabeth . The nonwhites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unjust laws " ( racial segregation ) by i ) filling the jails to overflowing , 2 ) catching the eye of the U.N . The African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress recruited 10,000 " volunteers " ready to go to jail when called . They were quite matter-of-fact about it . " I told my boss that I 'm scheduled for arrest next week , " explained one Negro volunteer . " My cousin will hold my job for me , and when I leave prison , he 'll go in . " <P> One morning last week a squad of South African detectives burst into the clinic in the tiny , tin-roofed Orange Free State village of Thaba N'chu and arrested 60-year-old Dr. James S. Moroka , the respected president of the anti-Malan African National Congress . He asked permission to attend his last patient and they agreed . Then Moroka , a devout Christian and moderate who believes that " white and black need each other , " was led off to jail , charged with " promoting the objects of Communism , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africans to " stay calm and behave with dignity . " <P> By arresting Moroka and 16 lesser leaders , some of them Communist-liners , Malan 's Nationalists plainly hoped to break the back of the disobedience movement . They were disappointed . The day after Moroka 's arrest , 96 more smiling Negroes got themselves jailed in Port Elizabeth , another 20 in nearby Uitenhage . So many nonwhites were volunteering as prisoners that some jails refused to take any more .
