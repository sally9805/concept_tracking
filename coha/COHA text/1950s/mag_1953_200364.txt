TRIUMPH AND TRAGEDY - Winsfon Churchill-Houghfon Mifflin ( $6 ) . <P> <P> The last time Churchill saw Franklin Roosevelt was on board the U.S. cruiser Quincy , in the harbor of Alexandria , after the Yalta Conference . The President seemed " placid and frail , " to have only a " slender contact with life . " The first time Churchill met Harry Truman was at Potsdam , ten weeks after the V-E day which Roosevelt did not live to see . Truman impressed the British Prime Minister with his " gay , precise , sparkling manner and obvious power of decision . " <P> While Truman , Churchill and Stalin were at Potsdam , news arrived of the successful test of the atomic bomb at Alamogordo . The momentous intelligence came in a code message : " Babies satisfactorily born . " Henry Stimson , U.S. Secretary of War , showed Churchill the message and translated it for him . The U.S. and British leaders , who had been downcast by the desperate Japanese resistance on Okinawa , were immensely cheered . <P> " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country yard by yard might well require the loss of a million American lives and half that number of British , " Churchill had reckoned . " Now all this nightmare picture had vanished . In its place was the vision-fair and bright indeed it seemed-of the end of the whole war in one or two violent shocks . " Churchill thought this " almost supernatural weapon " would induce the Pacific enemy to surrender and thus save many Japanese lives as well . <P> In view of the soul-searching and breast-beating that took place after Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the quick decision by the U.S. and British at Potsdam , as recorded by Churchill , now seems rather remarkable . " There never was a moment 's discussion . . . There was unanimous . . . agreement around our table . " <P> The question then arose of how to tell Stalin . Truman decided to tell him in a private conversation , and Churchill watched it from about five yards away . " I can see it all as if it were yesterday . He Stalin seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Probably decisive on the whole Japanese war ! What a bit of luck ! " Afterward , Churchill asked Truman : " How did it go ? " The President answered : " He never asked a question . " The reason for Stalin 's lack of curiosity became clear in later years , but in this account Churchill does not go into postwar disclosures of espionage . <P> Brute Issues . Triumph and Tragedy is the sixth and final volume , the epilogue , of Churchill 's tremendous history of World War II , which he modestly calls " my personal narrative . " In this volume , the thunder of military crisis is past ; the tides of the war against Germany have been turned at Stalingrad and El Alamein , and the book is suffused with the glow of anticipated victory . The chronicle begins with Eisenhower 's invasion of Normandy , which opened the land approaches to Germany and made Hitler 's defeat certain , though not easy , quick or cheap . Churchill tells the closing episodes of the battle story fairly placidly , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum of attention to their quarrels ( although in one place he does say that Omar Bradley 's postwar criticism of Montgomery-TIME , June 18 , 1951-was " unfair " ) .
