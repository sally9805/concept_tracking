 | New Supertankers Outgrow Harbor @# W HEN the latest queen of the commercial seas , the Sinclair Petrolore , made her maiden voyage to America recently as the largest cargo ship of any kind afloat , she could n't get up the Delaware River . She was carrying a load of oil from Kuwait on the Persian Gulf for a refinery at Marcus Hook , just outside Philadelphia . With her full load she drew 40 feet of water , but the Delaware channel is only dredged to 35. just inside the river mouth she pumped about a third of her cargo of 16b million gallons to another tanker , the Nashbulk . Then both steamed upriver to the clocks . The choice of ship to do this lightering job was an ironic one . When the Nash134 POPULAR SCIENCE one jutting way out into the deep water from a long thin sandspit in the Persian Gulf . bulk was built in 1945 , she was the largest tanker in the world . As her skipper ' wryly remarked . " Eleven years ago a queen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period the title of largest tanker in the world has changed hands so many times that , to quote one shipping man : " We 'd read about a new record holder every week . " Cargo carriers are rated by the ability to lift a payload ( deadweight tonnage in long tons of 2,240 pounds ) . The champion Petrolore has a capacity of 56,500 tons of crude oil , compared to the Nashbulk 's 1945 record of 24,000 . When the Nashbulk was launched she was considered a supertanker . Today @# 40,000- and 50,000-tonners are common , and the Nashbulk comes in the category of " little supertankers . " There are some 70 supertankers of 30.000 tons or more in service , and more than three times that many under construction , on order , or planned . The Petrolore , in fact , is about to lose her briefly held crown as the world 's biggest cargo ship in actual service . An 8:3,500-tonner was launched last month at Kure , Japan ? the first of two new supertankers of that size built by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carriers of New York . ( The Sinclair in her name comes from the Sinclair Refining Co. , which has the ship under a long-term charter . ) A supertanker is a huge rectangular box , divided into smaller compartments so that oil wo n't slosh around and so that , if desired , several kinds of refined products can be carried at once .  | At the front of this squared-off box is . : more or less pointed bow ( surprisingly blunt on the Petrolore ) , usually containing bunker oil for the ship itself and sometimes a small dry-cargo hold . At the stern there 's space for engines , more bunker-oil tanks , and a house for crew 's quarters . On a regular tanker there 's another house amidships with the bridge and deck officers ' quarters . On a combination tanker-ore carrier this house is way up forward . The main body of the ship is a slabsided , flat-bottomed tank , with valves and pipelines all over the place . There is a minimum of curves because the idea is to get the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too wide . The Petrolore , with her 40-foot draft and 106-foot beam , can just squeeze through the Panama Canal with a load . The controlling depth in the canal is 41 feet , the lock width , 110 . Even the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth draw a few inches less than 40 feet . In length , the Petrolore ? 789 feet overall ? ranks sixth among merchantmen now in use , coming after the Queen Elizabeth ( 1,031 ) , Queen Mary ( 1,020 ) , United States ( 990 ) , Liberte ( 937 ) and Ile de France ( 793 ) , all of them transatlantic passenger liners . Only the two Queens are broader . The 83,500-ton supertankers will be roughly 850 feet long , 125 feet in beam , with a loaded draft of some 47 feet . They 'll be too big for any of the world 's great canals and most of the world 's harbors . The busiest port in the world ? New York ? is dredged to only 45 feet . Tankers got so big because size saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from overseas fields ? in the Middle East , Central and South America , and the East Indies . The oil companies just ca n't move it home fast enough . And what goes for the U.S.A. goes triple for Great Britain and much of the rest of Western Europe , which has to import almost all of its oil . On the Delaware River alone there are today seven refineries in operation @# which can use a total of some 800,000 barrels of crude oil a day ( a barrel equals 42 gallons ) , and another one is now being built . A full load from the Petrolore is about 400,000 barrels , half a day 's supply for the whole river , less than four clays for the Sinclair refinery . But it 's still a whale of a lot of oil . Carried by rail , it would fill 1,350 railroad-tank cars making a train 10'i miles long . It would heat 2,000 small homes all winter , run 14,000 cars for a year ? and still leave enough to operate a super-@#  | liner like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , 18,000 tons was considered pretty big for a tanker , but a modern ship of twice that capacity can cut transportation costs per barrel by about a third . It does n't take so much more fuel to move the bigger ship , the crew is very little larger , and even the cost of building is not proportional to capacity . Some of the big tanker operators are now talking about ships of 100,000 tons , and a former shipper who is adviser to one large firm predicts that 200,000 tons may not even be the top . At present , limitations are set by the problems of unloading and the availability of drydocks big enough to service these gigantic vessels . Lightering oil with " little supertankers " seems to offer a solution for the first . The drydock problem may be solved by building new docks . 138 POPULAR SCIENCE Mass . ( PSM , May , p. 156 ) .

The propeller shaft is driven by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other sources requiring electricity . Exhaust gases , before returning to the reactor , make steam that runs auxiliary machinery and heats the ship . National Bulk is already talking about constructing a new shipyard from scratch in the West Indies . Loading the monster ships is not a problem because they generally take on oil offshore . Life aboard a supertanker is acknowledged by seamen to be tough . The ships spend hardly any time in port ; there 's plenty of work to do ; and there 's always the danger of fire and explosion . Pay and quarters , however , are much better than average . Compared to many of the newest tankers , the Petrolore is pretty Spartan , but she has only two men in a room , with separate rooms for each officer , and recreation rooms for officers and men . At the top end of the Iuxury scale are ships like the Norwegian 34,320-ton Jaragua , finished last fall , which has separate wood-paneled staterooms for Continued on page 292 **31;0;TOOLONG  | every man aboard , air-conditioning , recreation rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an elevator . Bigness does n't always make for comfort , though . At sea , supertankers have shown a tendency to be wet , plowing through waves when loaded rather than riding over them . In foul weather this turns them into , a series of floating islands , with the fo'c'sle , bridge , and poop decks sticking up , and the tank decks awash . Catwalks connect the after house and bridge on most of them , but to go all the way forward a seaman generally has to struggle along slippery steel deck plates holding on to an overhead lifeline and praying . Since mess rooms are aft , bridge personnel have long and often wet hikes to chow . The long days at sea ( the Petrolore takes more than a month to bring oil from the Persian Gulf to the U.S.A. ) are n't lazed away . Besides standing watch and maintaining machinery , there 's @# always corrosion to be fought . Mode tankers have dehumidifiers to help pr tect the insides of tanks , but the exterio still have to be cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th Petrolore , there 's nearly an acre and a half of main deck alone . The complement of the Petrolore is amazingly small , only 45 men . Sever. other supertankers carry more than 50. but even that is low compared to the 40 or so on the now-small 16,000-tonners built 10 to 15 years ago . The extra men are not for watch standing but to maintain the ship . The 83,500-tonners will sign on only another four to six men . again to take care of the added surface . Oil is a tricky cargo to handle , as several accidents have proven . When it 's being pumped aboard at the rate of thousands of gallons a minute , valves have to be opened and shut with splitsecond accuracy . To keep the ships on @# , 294 an even keel , center tanks are usually filled first , then outside or wing tanks . The switching has to be timed to prevent spillage ; a slow man or a sticky valve can result in a 20-to-30-foot geyser of oil . In filling tanks , allowance must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot sun beats down hour after hour on the tank decks . If too little air space is left , oil will be forced out of overflow pipes and the whole ship may be covered with an oozy , gooey and highly inflammable mess . Oil vapors inevitably escape from tank vents and glands in pumps and valves , so smoking is forbidden except in living spaces and on the bridge . When on one ship a machinist tightened up on the pumps to keep down seepage , the friction overheated the metal and the whole compartment blew up . The regular run of supertankers is a shuttle service from oil field to refinery and back- one way loaded to the marks with crude oil , the other ballasted with sea water to keep the ship seaworthy . The Petrolore will attempt to cut down that empty time from 50 percent to around 30 . Instead of a shuttle service , her eventual run is planned to be a complete trip around the world .

From Marcus Hook , the next leg is an empty one to Venezuela to pick up iron ore to carry to japan by way of the Panama Canal . From japan , she 'll go in ballast back to the Persian Gulf . The complete voyage of some 29,000 nautical miles , with loading and unloading time , will take roughly three months , depending on weather .
