txt LONDON , Jan. ** skyrocketing price of tea is converting one of the basic necessities of British life into something of a luxury and stirring a tempest in Britain 's political teapot . Six times within the last twelve months the price has been increased . Popular brands are selling at $1.07 to $1.12 a pound , or about 28 cents more than a year ago . At Christmas , tea was sold as a gift in Regent Street shops . Some concerns packed it in gay tin canisters or lead-lined caddies and one offered four ounces in a Staffordshire china Toby jug . Even if the millions of Britons who insist on downing a cup or two before getting out of bed were willing to switch to coffee  --  and that is most unlikely ? it would hardly pay . The price of coffee is about the same as that of tea and i is soon going up 7 to 14 cents a pound . The jump in the price of tea has been cited by Labor party members as proof of their contention that Conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living .

Others already have urged an investigation of the tea trade , a subsidy for tea and a return to Government bulk purchasing of the commodity . They have accused the Government of callous indifference to low-paid workers and . pensioners in whose lives tea is an important factor . Except for the Irish , . whose consumption is about the - same , the British drink far more tea // than any other people . The average a person here is about ten pounds a year . In the United States , now the second largest importer , it barely reaches threequarters of a pound . The American who insists he can not start the day without coffee is akin to the Briton who must have . his cup of tea .

When the alarm sounds , a kettle of water left the night before begins to heat . When the water boils , the kettle tips up and pours it into leaves in the pot .

On a wintry morning in an un- ' heated room , this gives him courage to hop out of bed and , plunge into his clothes . Still others take vacuum flasks of the cheering fluid to bed with them so that they can face the new day with equanimity . Travelers are not neglected .

The high price is attributed chiefly to increased world consumption , notably in the United States , Canada and some producting countries , and failure of production.to keep pace with it . Increased labor and handling costs and a sharp rise in export duties imposed by India and Ceylon also have contributed . II . S. Tea Price Rises , Too Anthony Hyde , executive director of the Tea Council in the United States , reported yesterday that the price of tea for the American consumer had risen about 6 cents for-forty-eight tea bags in the last year . The average consumer here , he explained , buys tea by the box of forty-eight bags . The present price for such a box of a largeselling brand is 58 to 60 cents . Mr. Hyde said the price rise here had not affected tea consumption . In fact , he said , the consumption of the beverage had increased 10 per cent during 1954 over the previous year .
