txt ' Demands by Boston fishermen for a higher minimum daily wage to be pressed at a meeting with boat owners today , has focused attention on the entire system of paying fishermen on a share-of-the-catch basis . They now get $7-a-clay minimum . The Atlantic Fishermen 's Union ( AFL ) entered negotiations today with boat owners to raise this to $10 . Fishermen receive 60 per cent or the income from the catch , but even when the catch is very small they still receive the minimum wage . Out of their 60 per cent the men pay for fuel , food ? ice . unloading , and watchmen 's expenses . Resistance to a higher minimum wage is expected to be great because the boat owners do n't make any money when the catch is bad so that the minimum payment is a direct drain on them . The fishermen 's union , under the leadership ? of Patrick , secretary-treasurer , has followed the unusual . tactic of going out on strike before it began negotiations . They ? tied up the 43-vessel fleet Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government would buy surplus fish that has piled up in warehouses and was keeping the price of fresh fish down to an average of 4 cents a pound in July . His request is still pending . Now the men have sent Mr. to the boat owners with a request for an increase . After that meeting they are to vote on continuing the tie-up . At best the fishermen can count on only about two trips a month . Many of the men have been earning only the minimum of $56 for an eight-day trip during July ? and August , a union spokesman said . The fish have been plentiful but several factors , including foreign imports , have kept the price down , observers say . On an annual basis , earnings vary more than $1,000 a year . In an effort to combat this , the Birds Eye Fisheries Division of the General Foods Corporation has been experimenting with a guaranteed wage plan in its fleet operating out of Rockland , Maine . The company guarantees the men $270 for a 12-day trip for ocean perch or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonus for catches over a certain amount . Based on records in past years , the company estimates that the wage-plus-bonus plan would bring the fisherman $8 , - 280 a year . In 1952 Birds Eye fishermen , under the present shares system , made $6,700 a year . In addition the men share in the company 's fringe benefits , including a pension plan and paid vacation . General Foods estimates that it will gain by ( 1 ) being able to control when the boats sail and return , to insure an even flow of fish through its processing plants , ( 2 ) taking only top quality fish , and ( 3 ) wiping out the fluctuating price of fish . A company spokesman said there was a reason for the fluctuating price when only fresh fish were sold on the market . The supply each day determined the price . But today quick freezing has enabled fish to be stored so that the flow to the markets can be controlled , With its wage plan , the company expects to be able to control its cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged the company before the National Labor Relations Board with refusing to bargain collectively and of attempting to sponsor an independent union , but the charges were thrown out last week for lack of sufficient evidence .
