Citation knew he was going to race that day . He failed to get the usual hay in his late morning feeding . Said Groom Dan Barnette : " He squealed and reared up in his stall just like a kid after being told he 's going to his first circus . " It was a good sign . Citation was ready to run for the $100,000 Hollywood Gold Cup at Inglewood , Calif . <P> With half a mile to go in the mile-and-a-quarter race , the mahogany-colored stallion took the lead .

" But Jones does not expect Citation to win another million . <P> <P> * Citation 's closest present-day competitor : Stymie , now retired after earning $918,485 . Man o ' War , who raced in the days when i neither purses nor dollars were so inflated , earned $249,465.                   @ @
