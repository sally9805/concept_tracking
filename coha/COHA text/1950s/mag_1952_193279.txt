Some people think that Air-Wicks purify the atmosphere by " absorbing " unpleasant odors . Not so . Air-Wicks give off chlorophyll and other scents which neutralize other odors . Tall ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) , handsome Manhattan Republican Newbold Morris , billed as the chief investigator to purify the graft-ridden Truman Administration , last week was doing effective duty as an Air-Wick . <P> A Crimson Creed ? Some of Morris ' fellow Republicans in Washington , hardly delighted at his taking the Truman appointment , were doing their best to make him trouble . Almost as soon as he got to Washington , Newbold was linked with the Chinese tanker deal . His law firm had got $100,000 in fees for advising onetime Congressman Joseph Casey of Massachusetts and the group which originally bought the surplus tankers from the Government . Furthermore , Newbold himself headed the China International Foundation , a philanthropic organization which held the stock of United Tanker Corp . ( see above ) , which , in turn , delivered oil to Communist China up to the start of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Karl Mundt teed off on Morris ' law firm by referring repeatedly to " blood profits " and what he called the " crimson creed " of American interests which had dealt with the Reds . Wisconsin 's Joe McCarthy happily announced ( without naming names ) that two members of the China International Foundation 's board had been active in Communist-front groups . Then the President , who was presumably hot-eyed also , called Newbold in to hear a few well-chosen words . <P> While the Republican Senators were working him over , Newbold , with the air of a man who was trying to make somebody else his Air-Wick , had started working over the President . As a guest on the television program Meet the Press , he coolly implied that Truman was holding out on him . He announced that he wanted any of 25,000 Government employees-to whom he has sent questionnaires-to be fired if they refused to tell all about their incomes . He added , threateningly , that he would quit if the President refused to act . He tramped on the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Dwyer and Truman 's longtime pal and palace jester , General Harry Vaughan . <P> The Angel Gabriel ? He would not , Newbold said , have appointed either man in the first place . When he was asked , " Has Vaughan been fired ? " he replied , significantly , " Not yet . " He was asked if he thought cabinet members who tolerated corruption should be fired . He answered : " What 's so wonderful about a cabinet member ? " He waxed sarcastic when someone wanted to know why Truman had ordered the cleanup drive . " Who , " he intoned , " is to know whether the Angel Gabriel appeared to the President ? " <P> <P> But for all his vigor before the television cameras , Morris left his interview with the President with a chastened look . Asked what Truman had told him , he refused to say , crying : " No , no , capital NO . I 'm a guy who talks too much . I 'm well known from the Bronx to the Battery as the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . " Twice a New York City Council president and twice an unsuccessful anti-Tammany candidate for mayor , he was asked how political infighting in Washington compared with that in New York .
