Not for twelve years had there been a new edition of Burke 's six-inch-thick Landed Gentry . Last week , in a rickety office in Fleet Street , Burke 's genealogists put the finishing touches to the first postwar edition , in a melancholy atmosphere of impoverished squires and mortgaged manor houses . Landed Gentry used to limit itself to owners of domains that could properly be called " stately " ( i.e. , more than 500 acres ) . Now it has lowered the property qualification to 200 acres for all British families whose pedigrees have been " notable " for three generations . <P> Even so , almost half of the 5,000 families listed in the new volume are in there because their forefathers were : they themselves have no land left . Their estates are mere street addresses , like that of the Molineux-Montgomeries , formerly of Garboldisham Old Hall , now of No. 14 Malton Avenue , Haworth . <P> Many of the old estates had been taken over by 20th Century squires whose bank balances outran their pedigrees . Alongside such ancient names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polwhele of Polwhele and MacLachlan of MacLachlan , Landed Gentry now lists Martins , Bartons and Fishers . It even mentions 700 people in the U.S. , including Cinemactress Joan Fontaine and the International Harvester McCormicks of Chicago . <P> Editor L. G. Pine has always been besieged by applicants who by cajolery , trickery or even bribery attempt to crash the book . " Pride of family sometimes carries people too far , " said he . " If everybody who claims to have come over with the Conqueror were right , William must have landed with 200,000 men-at-arms instead of about 12,000 . " <P> According to Editor Pine , only three British families can prove descent through the male line from the Saxons who invaded Britain in the 5th Century . These are the Ardens ( one was Shakespeare 's mother ) , the Berkeleys and the Swintons . And only three can prove male descent from the Companions of William the Conqueror in 1066 : Malet ( or Mallet or Mellat ) , Giffard , and De Marris . Even King George VI 's Saxon descent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim legitimate descent from such royal ancestry . Pine calls Edward III ( 1312-77 ) the crossroads of British genealogy . Says he : " If you have some family tie with Edward III , you go back all the way . "
