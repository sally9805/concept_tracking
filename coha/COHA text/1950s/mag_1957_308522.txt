Let me go where'er I will I hear a sky-born music still . <P> - Ralph Waldo Emerson <P> In the calm and cloistered air of 19th century New England , the Sage of Concord tuned his inner ear to the faint , sweet sounds that issued from his Transcendental trees and rocks . If he could hear sky-born music wherever he went , his friends and neighbors were less fortunate ; they had to depend on the uncertain efforts of a handful of local groups , supplemented by occasional trips to Boston . In null century Concord , New Englanders do not find themselves so hampered-and Emerson would scarcely be left in peace to do his ethereal listening . Today 's American , let him go where'er he will , hears the sound of music still-hardly celestial , but often sky-born . <P> If the explosion of painting in Renaissance Italy marked an " awakening of the eye , " the explosion of music in post-World War II America suggests a massive unstopping of the U.S. ear . " Americans have discovered music , " says Music Merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and blue and green where all had been black and white before . " In its musical black-and-white era , the U.S. already had great symphony orchestras , great opera , great foreign artists-and it conquered the world with its jazz . What is different today is the extraordinary breadth of the nation 's music production and consumption : operas and orchestras by the hundreds , musicians by the thousands , instruments by the millions-and blowing over it all . almost defying measurement , rising above the noise even of America 's engines , the wonderful , relentless whirlwind of recorded sound . <P> Who Is Listening ? The music boom sometimes seems less a cultural awakening than a mammoth assault of indiscriminate sounds on a public that no longer has any place to hide . Amateur psychologists say that the U.S. is becoming afraid of silence . Music in wild profusion volleys forth from phonographs , radios , television sets , jukeboxes . Piped music ushers untold thousands of Americans into the world ( hospital delivery rooms ) , through it ( garages , restaurants and hotels ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millions open their eyes to it , wrap themselves in it as they drive to work , turn out goods and services to a brisk , production-boosting beat ( overall stitchers in Colorado stitch 10% faster to Ai n't We Got Fun ) . <P> In this holiday season , the musical voice of Christmas carries to vacationers paddling beneath the surface of Miami pools ( via underwater loudspeakers ) , to women in slenderizing salons , to celebrators in non-slenderizing saloons . In Philadelphia , worshipers can drop by the Arch Street Methodist Church and adjust a selector to the hymn of their choice . From the highest building in Salt Lake City , Christmas carols boom across the Salt Lake Valley . " I do n't want to sound like Scrooge , " complained an irate woman , " but damn it , I do n't want to go without sleep until December 26th , either ! "
