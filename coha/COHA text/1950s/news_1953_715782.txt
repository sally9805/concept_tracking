txt Nationwide shortage of clerical workers at a time of full employment is causing office managers to do some hard thinking about how to attract  --  and hold  --  their employees . High-school and businessschool *graduates , looking for their first jobs , sense a " seller 's market " for their services . They knOw by the " grapevine " that they can afford to be choosy  --  that they can shop around for the location , hours , wages , and extra benefits they desire . At the same time , experienced clerical workers critically view their own surroundings . Not a few toy with the idea . that it may be " time for a change . " How serious is the shortage ? In Boston , where insurance and banking firms make heavy demands for clerical help , the state employment office currently has better than 1,200 office jobs to fill . What Does Job Pay ? But employment officials hasten to add that this is not an accurate measure of the clerical shortage . Their books show only the number of workers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . They estimate that the number of office job vacancies in Boston alone is double or triple the 1,200 figure . There is a need for stenographers , bookkeepers , typists , file clerks , comptometer operators , receptionists , ediphone operators , messengers , and others . One day recently the Massachusetts State Employment Office had a request from a single company for 75 typists and 75 clerks . Big orders are not necessarily the hardest to fill . Finding 150 girls for that particular firm may be easier than finding 15 for some others . Why ? Because the company may have satisfying answers to these questions : Requirement Revisions " How much does the job pay ? " " What are the hours ? " " What about rest periods ? " " Where is the office ? Is it near transportation ? " Those are the questions the average girls just out of high school ask the employment interviewer . They ask them in that order , and in quick succession . If the answers do n't measure up to expectations , a lifted eyebrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only siga of a " seller 's market " for stenographic and other office talent . In Boston , 41 per cent of the clerical job applicants are already employed and are actively looking for a better job ? often during their lunch hour . Another sign of the shortage  --  and an indication of how some employers are meeting it  --  is the downward revision of minimum typing speed asked and a greater emphasis on accuracy required . Companies asking 40-45 words a minute of beginners last year . are settling for a 30-35 rate this year . Like other affiliates of the United States Employment Service throughout the country , the Massachusetts Division of Employment Security is rallying with suggestions on how to meet Oho nrohlAm Advice for Employers Here are some ideas they have offered employers : 1 . Explore and utilize all available sources of worker supply . These include older-age applicants , housewives , physically handicapped workers , and wives of servicemen temporarily stationed in your area . 2 . When feasible , revise downward your educational requirements . Do n't demand a high-school graduate if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Constantly evaluate your salary schedules and working conditions in the light of current competition and living expenses . 4 . In your advertising and interviewing , stress the advantages your company offers  --  prestige , location , caliber of workers , quality of equipment , fringe benefits , and so on . Many girls attach more importance to these factors than to salary . Failure to offer advancement or increased salary for skills learned on the job is termed " not smart " by state employment officials , who cited the following example : One firm hired a page girl at $35 a week . She knew nothing about typing , but picked it up with company encouragement . Within a few months she had built up speed to about 35 words a minute and was on a par with other beginning typists . Pattern of ' Quits ' But the company failed to offer a raise commensurate with the new work she was doing , and the girl said she was going to leave . When the firm learned this , they offered a , slight raise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it today , I was worth it yesterday . I do n't want to have to fight for everything . " She found a typing job with another company , thanks to the skill the old company had fostered but failed to reward in time . The state employment office  --  in constant touch with the flow of clerical help , through direct contact with employers and job seekers ? can often perform a special service for both . By observing a pattern of " quits " from one firm , the Boston employment office was able to avert a serious situation . Seven girls from that firm came to the office during one noon hour , all individually , but all with complaints against a single department head . There was no history of past trouble between this supervisor and his workers , and a phone call from the employment office to the firm disclosed the latter 's unawareness of any difficulties , As a result of that timely call , the firm traced the trouble to an illness in the supervisor 's family , gave him a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the dissatisfied workers , Successes like that are bright moments for the 61 staff members who man the Boston office handling professional , clerical , and sales help . Last year they made 14,446 placements . vetIFi4- ? ( 04 1 RN " PERIODS/
