New York , as any visitor can see , is the showplace of change , the city that always sports the latest and shiniest in automobiles , literary movements and ballpoint pens , where perfectly good buildings are torn down every year to make way for newer and better ones . Only its politics have stopped moving . Politically , New York is a kind of petrified forest , where reform candidates roam in solidly institutionalized groups , and the stumps of once-great political growths clutter the landscape . <P> Last week the forest was a busy place , as party leaders and professed independents got their men ready for the 1953 mayoralty elections . By week 's end , six candidates had signed up to run for the $40,000-a-year-job - generally regarded as the second-roughest executive post in the U.S.-The issues which divided the candidates , and the factions supporting them , were often just barely visible in the forest 's dim light . <P> Wrecking the Party . The most obvious aspirant was Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri . Democrat Impellitteri , 53 , is a likable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long that even his casual conversations manage to sound like scraps from political speeches . In the 1950 elections , he bucked his own party machine and won , running as an independent on a ticket titled Experience Party . By now , with three years of distributing City Hall patronage behind him , he has considerable Democratic Party support . <P> " Impy " is running on his record ( " Not just fair ; it has been excellent " ) , and there have been worse ones . All sides agree that he is honest , and that he has appointed some capable administrators to city departments . But he has shown little or no understanding of the city 's wretched financial position which is steadily growing worse , and he has made only weak efforts to solve specific problems like New York 's huge transit deficit ( TIME , Apr. 20 ) , which last week resulted in a 15 fare for all the city 's subway turnstiles . <P> Against Impy are the remains of Manhattan 's once-powerful Tammany machine , now run by Leader Carmine De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boss Edward J. Flynn , an old confidant of Franklin D. Roosevelt . <P> Last week , in a traditional smoke-filled Manhattan hotel room , the opposing Democratic party bosses had it out . Queens Leader James A. Roe , Brooklyn 's Kenneth Sutherland and Staten Island 's Jeremiah A. Sullivan insisted on nominating Impellitteri . De Sapio and Congressman Charles A. Buckley , representing Flynn , refused to go along with them , then carried the fight into a hotel corridor , where reporters overheard the end . Yelled Leader Buckley , " You are wrecking the Democratic Party ! " Snapped Leader Roe , " You might as well go out on 42nd Street . We 're going to stop you sabotaging the party . " <P> Two days later , Flynn and De Sapio put up their own candidate , Manhattan Borough President Robert F. Wagner , 43 , an amiable party worker whose father , the late Senator , was one of the city 's greatest vote getters.                    @
