These Slum Landlords Got Smart By SIDNEY SHALETT OT long ago I visited a place that left me N feeling sick and angry . It was an area inhabited by many families . In a dirt compound where many children played I noticed a pine box . It looked like a crude coffin standing on end . My guide took me over to it and we looked inside . It was a so-called toilet . It did n't work properly , and raw sewage was being spewed into the enclosure where the children played . On the nearby ruin Of a back porch a middle-aged woman stood . " It belongs to this place , " she said , pointing to the upright pine box . She invited us to come in and look at the place she called her home and we accepted . It was a nightmare of filth , desolation and decay . The electrical-wiring system had long since ceased to work , and there were no bathing facilities . The crumbling floor was pocked with dangerous holes and the plaster walls were scrofulous from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent , to a landlord whose name was well known in the community ? fourteen dollars and forty cents a month . As I stood there with a handkerchief over my face to shut out the smells , I was reminded of something I saw on Saipan during the war  --  a compound where thousands of captured enemy civilians had been jammed . In the center of the compound was a wire enclosure where a family of lepers ? father , mother and children  --  had been penned up . In both places I felt the same sickness , only the place with the upended coffin toilet was n't Saipan , and the people who lived there were n't lepers or even aliens . It was a slum section of a great American city , and the people were American citizens whose existence had little in common with the accepted picture of the American way of life . There is nothing new about the existence of slums , and unfortunately it can not be denied that virtually every American city has them . The bright ray in the picture , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is now being tempered with a new element of hope . There is a growing movement throughout the nation to rehabilitate the type of human pigsties described above . This particular movement is not an action of the Federal Government ; it is being undertaken , with varying degrees of willingness , by the slum landlords themselves . The movement is a simple thing . Cities are waking up to the fact that there are laws on the statute books prohibiting human occupancy of such substandard dwellings . There is a gradual tightening of law enforcement , and slum houses are being fixed up , at the expense of the owners , to comply with minimum standards of safety and sanitation . In most cases this means installation of indoor toilets and bathtubs ; provision of at least cold running water inside the house ; reinforcement of sagging walls , floors and roofs , and rat-proofing . These are the bare essentials ; there is no effort yet to impose such " frills " as hot water , central heating and painting . However , in many cases , occupant-owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements and spent a little extra to make their places comfortable and attractive as well as safe . The movement is no miracle  --  at least , not yet . As Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro , of Baltimore , says , it is first aid rather than surgery . By this he means that a partially patched-up slum still remains essentially a slum . But the problem is so big and the evils which slums create are so unpalatable that any help  --  even first aid  --  is welcome . A great deal of credit is due the National Association of Real Estate Boards for getting this movement going on a nationwide scale . For a number of years , the association , which is opposed to public housing , had been passing resolutions saying , in effect , that the job of slum clearance ought to be undertaken by private enterprise . It was pretty much a matter of paying lip service to the idea . A few years ago , however , a young and well-bred Boston realtor named Joseph W. Lund ( Harvard , ' 26 ) , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , began brooding about the futility of passing pious resolutions which never got anywhere . Though his firm did n't deal in that kind of property , he viewed Boston 's slums with disgust , and he studied with interest what the city of Baltimore was doing about its slums . The so-called Baltimore Plan was the first large-scale municipal attack of its type on the slum problem . Observing the enthusiasm with which other cities began to study ? and even copy ? the Baltimore Plan , Lund , during his 1952 term as president of the association , gave impetus to the movement by setting up a Committee on Rehabilitation . This committee , headed by Harold S. Goodrich , a Springfield , Ohio , realtor , has sparked a drive to insist that slum landlords clean house . So far , Chairman Goodrich reports , local real-estate hoards are supporting slum-rehabilitation programs in more than 120 cities in thirty-two states . These statistics , however , should be viewed with qualification . Not all of the 120 cities as yet can boast of full-fledged programs . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the honor roll . But the others at least are moving . In its drive to rouse public opinion behind slum rehabilitation , the real-estate group has found an effective partner in the National Association of Home Builders . Alan F. Brockbank , president of the latter group , has stumped the country , forcefully urging the need for checking city blight through private effort . Those interested in the movement acknowledge freely that it is impossible to get anything done without a lot of help from a variety of sources . At the head of the list there must be the municipality itself , for the key to the program is wise and impartial enforcement of the housing laws . There must also be support from civic groups , and it helps to have a few dedicated individuals in town who get fighting mad when they see humans living in squalor . Another thing that should be made plain is that this is not an altruistic program . Everybody benefits from it  --  tenant , landlord and city . There 's not much of the do-gooder streak in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action out of him : use a legal club or show him how he can make more money . While some of them have been ornery enough to insist on being clubbed , others have responded to the demonstrated fact that , under present economic conditions , it is profitable business to invest money in fixing up slum property . It is pleasant , however , to report that in most cities there is a good representation of slum landlords who , in addition to enjoying the profits , are enjoying the feeling of doing something good for their less PHOTOGRAPHY BY HARRY SALTZMAN fortunate fellow humans . Some of them have become the most zealous boosters of the program . " When I look into the mirror now , " one of them told me , " I like what I see better . " The association stresses a point that is a keystone to the whole drive : municipalities need no special new laws to get a slum-rehabilitation program under way . " In every city charter can be found the basic health , sanitation and safety requirements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the association . " All that is needed is for the municipality to enforce them . It helps , of course , if the city can get public opinion behind it , for the success of this program depends more on co-operation than coercion . " Some cities have found it helpful to pass new ordinances with more teeth in them . If , however , the seeking of new model laws is going to provoke a local fight that may endanger the program , any city can make a start merely by using its basic powers to condemn fire hazards and health nuisances . After talking with association officials in Washington , I visited two cities for firsthand observations of the slum-cleaning movement . It was difficult to narrow down the choice of cities , for programs with interesting and varied facets are under way in all parts of the country . Finally , I chose Baltimore , Maryland , and Charlotte , North Carolina ? Baltimore because it was a metropolis which had served as the cradle of the slum-rehabilitation movement , and Charlotte as a smaller city with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a big city 's efforts to cure itself of slum blight . The rehabilitation program is only one prong of a three-pronged effort , for the city also is heavily engaged in urban redevelopment ? complete demolition of hopelessly blighted blocks ? and public-housing programs . These , however , are largely financed by Federal funds ; slum rehabilitation , while less spectacular , spares the national treasury . The Baltimore slums were  --  and still are  --  truly horrible . Baltimore is an old city , and some of the cramped , sagging red brick row houses , which creep backward from the historic harbor , have been standing for more than 100 years . When the drive began , it was estimated that there were 2100 blocks containing approximately 95,000 blighted dwellings . Prodigious efforts have succeeded in curing the major portions of perhaps 120 of these blocks . " As you can see , " G. Yates Cook , the director of the city 's Housing Bureau , says with bleak understatement , " we still have a good deal to work on . " The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Evening Sun , a newspaper of crusading spirit , began turning the spotlight of corrosive prose and photographs on the dreadful places in which many people lived . At about the same time , the City Health Commissioner , Dr. Huntington Williams , flatly condemned and had torn down a block of the city 's worst slums . Public opinion was rallied by the newly organized Citizens ' Planning and Housing Association , of which Miss Frances H. Morton , a social worker , was the driving spirit . The movement gained momentum . In 1941 Baltimore adopted a single concise ordinance covering the " hygiene of housing . " This ordinance gives the Health Department clear authority to post " **25;4152;TOOLONG " notices on hopelessly run-down property ? a prelude to razing or enforced repair . In 1945 an experimental enforcement drive was conducted in an area DOW immortalized in the history of the Baltimore Plan as " Block One . " " Five hundred people lived there , and 500 rats were killed as the clean-up progressed , " recalls James W. Rouse , now chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a concrete-paved recreational area , equipped with playground equipment which was paid for by the Kiwanis Club , stands on the site of old rubble heaps in the former rat heaven . The property was donated by the landlords . The blocks surrounding it have been cleaned up . Some slum landlords like to tell you that slum dwellers really prefer to live like pigs and are indifferent-to the niceties of life . The Negro families around Block One are proudly tending little gardens , and thinking up homemade ways  --  such as whitewashing old tires as borders for flower beds  --  to beautify their neighborhood . Development of the Baltimore Plan , however , has been a matter of evolution , rather than upheaval , and various strong forces have come into existence over the years to aid it . In 1951 , Mayor D'Alesandro , himself a product of Baltimore 's slums , set up a special Housing Bureau within the Health Department . Its director , Yates Cook , who had begun his city career as a sanitary inspector , became the conscience of Baltimore , insofar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that once a letter ecrawlingly addressed to " Department What Makes You Fix up Your Fences and Yards " was delivered to him without delay . Earlier the mayor had created a Citizens ' Advisory Council to aid the movement . This group now is urging that the Housing Bureau be divorced from the Health Department in order to lessen the administrative red tape and thus speed up the antislum drive . It proposes creation of a nonsalaried Citizens ' Commission on Blight to which the bureau would be responsible . Yates Cook has a sure way of making converts . He takes them on personally conducted tours of the slum areas . So far , the combined efforts of all the city agencies have been able to effect enough substantial improvements on more than 16,000 substandard dwellings to make them decently habitable . This still leaves nearly 80,000 units to work on , so Cook has plenty to show . I went walking with Cook through some of his " rock-bottom " slums for as long as I could stand it . He led me through so-called " squeeze-gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with excrement , muck and garbage . Hordes of persistent flies settled on us . I beat the air with a handkerchief in a not very successful effort to keep them off my face . Later , Mrs. Mildred Atkinson , a member of the mayor 's council , told me of taking a group of well-to-do children on a similar tour . " Never , " a little girl had told her gravely , " will I trust a fly again . " Everywhere in the unimproved areas were ramshackle , rotting board fences behind which the slum dwellers piled their incredible debris ; it was as if the people themselves were hiding behind these rotten screens . And behind every fence , it seemed , was a snarling , half-wild dog , kept to fight the rats . By the time Cook and I had picked our way through the litter to peer at a filthy , choked-up outdoor toilet that served two families of eight adults and ten children , I had had enough for one session . " These are the neighborhoods , " Cook said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Baltimore 's ' best families ' live . " Scores of children who grow up in such places have been bitten by rats , many with serious results . I told Cook I wanted to see one such case . He took me to a place inhabited by Carl and Clara G. They had three small children , and Clara was pregnant again . They had lived at the same address for four years , and rats were an old story to them . Their landlord reluctantly bad taken certain corrective actions after the city served a warrant on him , but , even with the " rat-proofing , " the rats still came . " These are real smart rats , " Clara said . " They come right through that hole over the sink and down the water pipe when they are thirsty . We put out poison , but they wo n't touch it  --  they are well-educated rats . " One night Clara heard Allen , aged six , scream in pain ; she rushed to him and found a rat had chewed his finger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten months , on the ear . " We took them to the hospital , " Clara recounted . " I guess the hospital reported it  --  God knows , we did n't ! ? and we were all called to court . Now the landlord is mad at us for taking the kids to the hospital . I 'm afraid he 's going to make us move . We do n't know where we 'll go , but we had to take those kids to the hospital , did n't we ? " Later , sitting around with Cook and three members of the advisory council  --  Chairman Rouse , Col. John McC . Mowbray and Guy T. 0 . Hollyday ? I discussed with t hem what was being done about the type of slums I had seen . All agreed that it would be ideal if these places could be entirely eliminated , yet , they pointed out , the ideal is hard to attain . If 95,000 dwelling units were suddenly removed from Baltimore 's already crowded housing facilities , without replacement , people would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore 's slums , though blighted , are not beyond reclamation . The brick row houses were built well in their day , and the walls and foundations are still sound . " When we bring about the necessary minimum improvements , " Cook said , " we have a place that , though it is no palace , is at least livable . " In the wake of the Baltimore Plan , several local phenomena have developed . One is the Fight Blight Fund . Colonel Mowbray and a number of prominent Baltimoreans have organized a nonprofit corporation which has raised money and retained an attorney to assist hardship cases . " When we find a deserving person who owns and occupies property which the city is requiring him to fix up , we will extend him a loan if he is unable to raise the money from other sources , " Colonel Mowbray explained . " Often  --  sometimes by guaranteeing the loan , sometimes merely by bringing him in touch with a sympathetic hank or loan company ? we make it possible for him to arrange his financing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharks . We also do what we can to steer him to responsible and reasonable neighborhood contractors . " THE S Another Baltimore innovation was the establishment in 1947 of a special Housing Court , the first of its kind in the United States . When the slum-rehabilitation drive got under way , cases were routes to the regular magistrates ' courts . A magistrate occupied with major felony hearings was not likely to become overly concerned a bout a landlord who was hauled up for not fixing a leaky downspout . Also , the landlords resented being brought into court along with the murderers , prostitutes and thieves . The first judge appointed to the Housing Court was an attorney named Harry S. Kruger . Judge Kruger 's bench conduct won the esteem of practically every citizen interested in the slum-clean-up movement . He was quiet , patient and , all agree , eminently fair , He was more interested in getting results than enforcing the letter of the law . " From a legal standpoint , " Kruger himself says , " I ran the rottenest court in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his closest friends if they were guilty , and , in the beginning , defendants and attorneys made open threats to " get him " politically . After he had been on the bench a few months , those who had damned him most violently were praising him . When Governor McKeldin , a Republican , succeeded Governor Lane , a Democrat , and decided to replace Kruger with Judge Helen Elizabeth Brown , civic groups pleaded unsuccessfully for his retention  --  not because they disliked Judge Brown , but because they felt Harry Kruger was so right for the job . In any event , under both Magistrates Kruger and Brown , the Housing Court has been an invaluable weapon , and advocates of the Baltimore Plan feel that establishment of such a special court would benefit any large city that wants to tackle a similar job . Baltimore now has designated twenty-seven blocks in the heart of the blighted section as a pilot area . All municipal forces , helped by block cornmittees of the slum dwellers themselves , are concentrating on an all-out clean-up to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescued . Inside the pilot area the Church of the Brethren is operating a building known as Pilot House . It was once one of the district 's worst hovels . Now it is a center where residents of the blighted areas can go for aid and advice . Physically , it has been converted into a handsome and sound little building that serves as a model of what can be done with a slum house . The building itself was purchased with funds raised by Brotherhood Service , Inc . Its members  --  white citizens who are mostly white-collar workers with modest salaries ? practice practical Christianity in their spare time by going into the Negro slums where needed and working free as carpenters , painters , cement layers and even garbage men . One of the active members of the Mayor 's Advisory Council is a realtor named Philip Needle . He freely states that he was one of the large owners of Baltimore alum property . " I have more than five hundred units , " Needle says , " and , frankly , before this thing came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . When the Baltimore Plan descended on me , it was a bitter pill to swallow , for it was going to cost me five hundred dollars apiece to fix up my places . " But Needle took a look at his properties and , as he puts it , " was sincerely shocked by what . I saw . " He went ahead with the repairs , and even went a little further than required by installing bathtubs in all of his places and do-Mg a certain amount of beautifying . " It 's been the best thing that ever happened to me , " he states . " In the first place , I feel better for it . In the second place , it has been good business . The rent-control board allowed me sufficient rent increases to give me a fair return on my investment , and the tenants are willing to pay it in return for the improvement in their living conditions . There is a friendlier relationship between tenant and landlord now . The tenants take better care of their places . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been started years ago . " Rouse , Mow bray and Hollyday are leaders in various phases of Baltimore real-estate operations , far removed from slum rentals . I asked them why they  --  as well as the other busy professional and business people who are members of the council  --  give so much time and energy to the drive . " It 's contagious , " said Hollyday . " You see what exists , you start to do something about it , and you find you ca n't turn loose . " Mowbray said , " I like this town . It 's a good place to live , and I want to make it better . I simply ca n't buy the proposition that any of our citizens should have to live like pigs . " Rouse nodded agreement , and added , " And we wo n't stop until Baltimore 's slums are entirely cleaned up . " In Charlotte , North Carolina , I found a different type of slum problem . City authorities there have worked out a technique for slum rehabilitation that well might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background . In fact , four other North Carolina cities already are copying the Charlotte Plan . Charlotte is a pleasant Southern city of about 134,000 population , a busy and prosperous industrial and commercial center . Negroes make up approximately one third of the population . Though there have been some attractive housing developments for Negroes built both by private enterprise and as part of the Federal housing program , most Negro families live in frame houses owned by white landlords . Few of Charlotte 's poorly housed families  --  including a relatively small percentage of white families in that category  --  own their own places The Charlotte slums , amounting to around 10,000 substandard units , were pretty had . Shanties were crowded together indecently in Negro sections hearing such neighborhood names as Black Bottom , Blue Heaven and Pigeon Roost . A single outdoor toilet and cold-water tap would serve several families . Electricity and bathtubs were as rare as an indoor toilet , and hot water was something you heated up on the wood cook stove , which also served as a central heating plant . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these places rented for as little as seventy-five cents a week . It was an atmosphere that bred resentment and crime . The impetus to clean up Charlotte 's slums was provided by the local Board of Realtors , with civic organizations joining in . Many citizens helped , but it is generally agreed that the bulk of the credit belongs to James E. Barrentine and Paul B. Guthery , real-estate men whose business activities do n't touch slum properties . Barrentine , a serious-minded civic booster who served as president of the Board of Realtors in 1945 , was the originator of the plan , and Guthery , who resembles a clean-shaven Abe Lincoln with a Southern accent , was his chief lieutenant . Before Barrentine took office , they met together informally to kick around a few ideas for a constructive program which the real-tors could back . The condition of Charlotte 's slums was an open scandal , periodically prodded by the city 's two newspapers , the News and the Observer . The realtors also were philosophically opposed to the spread of Federal public housing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so let 's do the job ourselves , " Barrentine proposed . A six-point plan was drawn up and adopted by the board , proposing not only that the shanties be made safe and sanitary but that the city follow up with necessary street , sewer and playground development , and that some effort be made to establish a social-service program . In December , 1945 , the city council passed a housing ordinance providing , in effect , that dwellings must have indoor toilets , running water and sinks , electric lights , chimneys or flues for installation of heating facilities , and screens . As a concession to property owners , a delayed deadline of July 1 , 1951 , was allowed for putting in bathtubs or showers . These sound like small things , but in the slums of Charlotte  --  as in many other cities ? they were practically revolutionary . To carry out the program , the municipality appointed James E. Hitch , a well-known and respected city employee , as enforcement director . In the beginning , Jim Hitch was a one-man squad  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . It was a good choice , for Bitch , whose easygoing and even temperament is in keeping with the local environment , also was fair , firm and inexorably methodical in executing his job . He pushed nobody around , unless he raised an inexcusable fuss , and cheerfully granted time extensions and other concessions , so long as the property owner in the end got the job done . Because of wartime controls , the Charlotte enforcement program did not really get under way until the fall of 1948 . As for results , Hitch reported last fall , every outdoor toilet in the city of Charlotte  --  except for a few privies in recently annexed county territory where the city has not yet installed sewers  --  has been banished . A total of 8558 formerly substandard houses had been brought up to standard , and 836 had been demolished as unfit for human habitation . The program for the installation of bathtubs or showers was about half completed , and Hitch was gently nudging the balance of tubless landlords into compliance . In money , Hitch estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested in improvements and new houses built to replace the demolished units . Charlotte 's easygoing enforcement method , although it would not work in a metropolitan center such as Baltimore , seems ideally suited for a city of its size and temperament . " The key to our success , " says City Manager H. A. Yancey , " is the technique of administration as carried out by Mr. Bitch . " There would be no need for a special Housing Court in a city such as Charlotte , for Hitch has carried less than a dozen cases to police court , and none to higher courts . To appreciate the improvement , one should have seen Charlotte 's slums in the old days . Many of them still look pretty awful . But Jim Hitch can take you around the city and point out the neat , new cinder-block additions housing indoor bathrooms ; the new concrete steps and porches , and the streets where every other house was torn down to give the remaining dwellings a little breathing space . Many of Charlotte 's property owners , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went beyond the minimum requirements by adding hot-water heaters and other conveniences , and sprucing up the outside of the shabby frame houses with paint or asphalt siding . Almost every Negro tenant of one of these reshuffled slums has responded by fixing up the yard with grass and flowers . Many volunteer to do interior painting and papering if the landlord will furnish m aterials . In general , it can be said that the owners of this type of property in Charlotte have come not merely to accept the program but to welcome it . The reasons are not complex : first , their property has improved to the extent where they can even get bank loans on it ; second , the improvements have more than paid for themselves in increased rents . Instead of getting anywhere from seventy-five cents to four dollars a week for decrepit slums , rentals on the improved property will run generally from seven to twelve dollars . For instance , one property owner invested $28,000 on improving thirty-five run-down hovels , but as his rentals have increased by $7000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the majority of the Charlotte landlords feel happier now about the kind of business they are doing . There are , of course , exceptions , but I was told that the number is small . I heard of one absentee landlord who owned eleven huts so ramshackle and worthless that they were being occupied rent-free by squatters . When the enforcement program came along , he started yelling about his constitutional rights and declaring that this was n't Russia , where you could order a man around . Jim Hitch quietly closed up the property and waited . Finally , the man got the word that there was money to be made in this thing . He invested $16 , - 000 , converted his shacks into safe and sanitary homes , and now the group is bringing him eighty-eight dollars a week rental ? $4576 a year . Another operator has fought Bitch every inch of the way . Ask him what he thinks of the Charlotte Plan and he 'll reply in two words : " It 's disgusting . " He has done only what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look dreadful . I was shown one of his slums which rents for seven dollars a week . Next to it was a two-family house which once had been equally bad , but which a more enlightened landlord had fixed up inside and out . It brought eighteen dollars a week rental . It did n't take a genius to figure which landlord was the winner . I talked with another large property owner whose viewpoint , to put it mildly , was feudal . He ranted about " do-gooders , well-wishers and up-lifters , " and said all this was a lot of foolishness because the kind of people who lived in these places were hopeless and did n't know what to do with a bathtub when you gave it to them . When I left him , I went around to some of the improved homes and talked with the tenants . That is quite an experience . They seemed to know what to do with their bathtubs , all right . I did n't see any coal stacked in them or any of the other horrors of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , who have lived and paid their rent in the same frame houses for twenty years , get a little damp-eyed when they tell you how nice it is just to be able to go to the bathroom without walking out into the rain . One white-haired woman of nearly seventy showed me the electric refrigerator and stove her children were buying since their place was fixed up . " I take a heap of pride now in my home , " she said . Others , speaking of their landlords with obvious good will , would use a colloquial expression : " He 's doing a lot to help us up . " These were the people who a few years ago were ripping up floors and walls for firewood . And so the movement goes . Throughout the country the Baltimore and Charlotte programs are being adopted , with local variations to fit existing conditions . As yet , it is a relatively small movement . But it is potentially enormous , for the trail-blazers are showing how great cities can be saved from the creeping decay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check of physical decay goes the effect which the program has on the checking of human blight . That may be the most far-reaching contribution of the growing movement to clean up the slums of America .
