The case for universal military training is as old as the Republic and twice as strong today as it was when George Washington presented the idea to Congress in 1789 . Again &; again since World War II , Harry Truman has asked Congress for U.M.T. But in the asking , the Pentagon has watered down the strong case to a weak brew of political expediency and half-measures . Last week the enemies of U.M.T. in the House of Representatives pounced on the latest U.M.T. compromise , seized it by its inconsistencies , and shook U.M.T. to sudden death while the Administration watched with fascinated horror . <P> The bill before the House was little more than a formal " go " signal for the U.M.T. program which Congress passed " in principle " last summer . This provided for six months ' training for all males turning 18 years , and required them to spend the following 7 years in the organized reserves or the National Guard . The bill up last week had some additional sugarcoating , e.g. , UMTrainees would not be called to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , and would not be served beverages with more than 1% alcoholic content . At the start of debate last week , U.M.T. 's well-primed enemies in the House were well aware that the whole U.M.T. program could be shelved by defeating the current bill . <P> The Opportunity . Early in the proceedings , Carl Vinson , chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the Administration 's man in charge , tried to head off trouble for his bill by offering more concessions . He proposed an amendment 1 ) postponing the start of U.M.T. until the present draft is ended , and 2 ) setting an automatic expiration date on U.M.T. for July 1 , 1958 . " That , " said Vinson , " meets every criticism of major importance that has been lodged against this bill . " <P> In the sense that the bill was now virtually gutted of all logic , he was dead right . In rushed Missouri 's Dewey Short to make the most of the opportunity . " Mr. Chairman , " said Short , " we have just witnessed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . We were told all during the hearings , by the proponents of this measure , that we must get U.M.T. started now in order to be able to build up this reserve , and as we built up this reserve gradually , then we would reduce gradually the number in the active service under the draft . The Vinson amendment is just a sop to get a few votes for the bill ... If we never begin U.M.T. , we will not have to end it . " <P> Carl Vinson 's amendment carried 126-19 , but-as Dewey Short had divined-it was more a sign of defeat than of victory . By a roll call of 236-162 , the House voted to send the whole U.M.T. bill back to committee , i.e. , to bury it .
