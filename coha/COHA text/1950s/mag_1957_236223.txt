THE SHORT REIGN OF PIPPIN IV ( 188 pp. ) - John Steinbeck-Viking ( $3 ) . <P> <P> At long last , France decided that the French Revolution had all been a big mistake ( some readers will say " I told you so " ) . Caught in a parliamentary impasse to end all parliamentary impasses , the National Assembly decided to abolish the republic and restore the monarchy . Hour-ra ! Vive le roi ! <P> This is the central situation of John Steinbeck 's latest booklet-an underdone novel and overdone gag which is a long , long way from wrathful Okies and Tortilla Flat . After Author Steinbeck and the Assembly make their momentous decision , there are of course almost as many pretenders in France as there ever were premiers , but the royal prize goes to a man who does not seek it-M . Pippin Arnulf Hristal , a distant collateral relation of Charlemagne. * <P> Before destiny sideswipes him , the lean , fiftyish Pippin is content to live on his unearned income and enjoy a nightly orgy of stargazing from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Mme. Hristal rations out new telescopes with a parsimonious hand . Daughter Clotilde , 20 , is addicted to Hollywood horse operas and has already Saganalyzed her life in a bestseller written at 15 , Adieu Ma Vie . <P> This typical French family is scarcely prepared for the brouhaha and hurluberlu that follow Pippin 's elevation to the throne . There is the grand opening of the " Versailles-Hilton " hotel ; the Folies-Bergere holds a contest for the official post of " King 's Mistress " ; and visiting royalty floods the capital ( " Ava Gardner and H.S.H. Kelly are in residence " ) . Two hundred nobles come out of the woodwork and descend on Versailles , all set to eat Pippin out of house and palace . His daughter 's American suitor proposes to merchandise the impoverished monarchy ( " The Dukedom of Dallas ? - why , ten billionaires would be after it " ) . All goes well as long as Pippin is content to remain wax in the hands of his advisers . Unfortunately , ermine makes the king , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pippin travels incognito ( on a motor scooter ) among his subjects and decides that what France most needs is an F.D.R.-style New Deal , a kind of People 's Monarchy . To a stunned constitutional convention met to draw up a Code Pippin , he lays down what he wants to be the law . beginning with the maddeningly un-French notion of everyone paying his taxes . Before the reader can say " Ca ira , " the mob is in the streets clamoring for the Fifth Republic , and what happens to King Pippin after that is best left for Author Steinbeck to tell . <P> Though The Short Reign of Pippin IV ( a May co-selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club ) is a fable that makes no claims for itself beyond the desire to please , its author waters Aesop with Alsop , mixes persiflage with prescriptions for the ills of modern France . The satiric lapses into the pontifical ( " The French are a moral people-judged , that is , by American country-club standards " ) . Pippin makes a charming king-for-a-day , but the joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh may stay to yawn . Hlas , political reality in France is so preposterous that even better satirists than Steinbeck have a hard time topping it . <P>
