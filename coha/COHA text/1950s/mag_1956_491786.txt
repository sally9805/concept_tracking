M any times , after a day of struggling with the problems presented by the prospect of fighting a global war with atomic weapons , I left my office in the Pentagon feeling a sort of nostalgic yearning for the simple life of the old Army into which I was born . Military matters were less complex in 1895 , and the toughest decision facing a top commander might have to do with some minor change in close-order drill or whether the tail of an artillery draft horse should be clipped four or six inches above the hock . It was a tiny , tidy Army that existed when I came squalling into the world one bright March morning at Fort Monroe , Virginia . Neither its tactics nor its weapons had changed much since Lec laid down his arms at Appomattox . Its glamorous branch was the cavalry , and its heroes were the mustached , spurredand-booted Indian fighters who with carbine and saber had " pacified " the Apache , the Cheyenne and the Sioux . Its bugles sounded from coast to coast , at lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these posts , scattered from Washington state to the Carolinas , that I spent my boyhood . I can recall but little of my earliest years at Fort Monroe , where my father commanded abattery of field artillery , for I am not one of those who can remember in fine detail what happened to them when they were two or three years old . My first recollections , in fact , are not of military life at all , but of a quiet civilian existence at my grandmother 's house at Garden City , Long Island . There my mother , my older sister and I took refuge briefly while my father went off to China during the Boxer Rebellion , to blast away at the walls of Peking with his horse-drawn guns . He was back within a year , and my life for a decade thereafter was spent on the Western posts  --  old forts , ( Continued an Page UM The author 's father , Coi .

The first was at Walla Walla , Washington , and it will always linger in my memory , for it was there that my father gave me my first rifle . It was n't a real rifle , but the standard weapon of the small boy of that day  --  an asthmatic air gun , which fired a little lead pellet with a sound like a small sneeze . Like any inexperienced soldier , I shot up all my ammunition in a hurry , and , like any soldier , I had to scramble around to solve this problem in supply . Happily , I discovered that the hard winter wheat they grew in Washington state made an excellent substitute for a BB shot , a fact which I proved to my own satisfaction by shooting a local farmer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomatoes for my mother . My pleasure in this discovery did not long survive my father 's homecoming that night . By strongly applying his palm to the seat of my pants . he impressed upon me the fact that I must never point a weapon at another unless my own life was in danger . I never forgot that admonition . My father was a splendid soldier , who loved the military service , but he believed that a boy should follow his own bent , and he made no effort to persuade me that L should make the Army my career , a philosoplw. which 1 am trying to follow in the rearing of my own six-year-old son . A man of inflexible principle , with a soldierly directness about him , he was at the same time possessed of inFmite gentleness and patience and he had a deep love for many things that had nothing to do with war . His greatest pleasure , when off duty , came from books and music , and one of my happiest moments as a youngster came when I saved up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a performance of Samson and Delilah at the Boston Opera House . His interest in music was shared by my beautiful and talented mother , who played the piano and sang , and brought an atmosphere of warmth and gaiety to whatever bleak and shabby quarters might be our lot . One of ow happiest memories , in fact , is of a freezing winter spent at Fort Snelling , Minnesota , in old quarters that had not been inhabited , except by rodents , since Indian days . We arrived there from Washington state just as the bitter cold began , and we spent the greater part of that winter in one room  --  the only one that had a fireplace  --  singing while my mother played , the sound of the music drowning out the shriek of the harsh winds that blew the snow in deep drifts against the doorways . For all his love of books and music , though , my father in one respect was a typical artilleryman . He was not disturbed by loud and sudden noises , and he felt that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosions on Independence Day . Consequently , for every Fourth of July he bought a prodigious quantity of cannon crackers , rockets and Roman candles , and let me set them off . He had a woodsman 's knowledge of the outdoors , and a poet 's eye for the beauties of nature , and from him I learned to love every type of terrain that God has made  --  mountains and plains , forests , deserts and the seashore , and all the creatures that dwelt therein . The most tangible things in life arc the most intangible , and my most vivid memories , strangely , are not of strife or battle , but of quiet days and nights spent with good companions in the open . One such moment came to me while serving as military adviser to the UN . Along with a number of other officers , in October of 1946 I went to Oak Ridge , Hanford and Los Alamos to see the atomic-energy installations , and to marvel , as all men must , at these supreme achievements of the faith , the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay over the great mountains of the West , a punishment to me , who remembered the wonderful days I had spent hunting and fishing and hiking and camping in these same areas as a boy . Then , after Los Alamos , we did have one wonderful day . Eight of us crowded into a pickup truck with chains and compound gear and , leaving the highway just south of the Colorado-New Mexico line , we penetrated far into the headwater meadows in the shadow of the continental divide . There , at an altitude of almost 11,000 feet , in the glory of the October sunshine , with the great snowcapped peaks rising all around us , we spent several hours fishing , taking in that short time over 200 brook trout , rainbows and German browns . That night , as we got back onto the main highway well after dark , the most amazing display of meteorites I have ever seen flashed across the sky . Ten or twelve shooting stars could be seen streaking across the heavens at once , leaving trails of fire that hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head had burned out . There was a half moon , no clouds , and that crystal ? By the time most men have money to burn , the lire has gone out . DAN BENNETT ? clarity of atmosphere which only the high mountains can offer . To me , such moments arc unforgettable . They uplift my soul as does no other experience on earth , and from them comes a renewed appreciation of Deity and of man 's small place in the great scheme of things . The lone virtue I can see in war , in fact , is the chance it gives a man to feel these deep emotions , to live under the open sky , to bed down at night on Mother Earth , to find again the talents for survival our pioneer forebears had , but which civilization has dulled in us . Millions of men who remember the dust of Africa , the mud of Normandy , the cold snows of Holland and the Bulge , will Snort at this , I know . But living in the open , bedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one aspect of a soldier 's life that never greatly troubled me . Hunting and fishing and camping with my father , 1 learned to take care of myself under primitive conditions when I was very young , and I have never lost the knack of it . Though my schooling in the ways of the woods was fairly complete , my formal education suffered , as did that of every other soldier 's son . My father , like any soldier , changed duty stations frequently , which meant that I would he pulled out of one school in midterm and plunked down in another a thousand miles away , sometimes losing half a year 's work . This did not disturb me greatly , for I was used to being uprooted , and only once was I somewhat shaken by the experience . I was going to a small , friendly , eq-educational high school in Virginia , when my father , who had transferred from the field to the coast artillery , was ordered to Boston Harbor . I was suddenly plucked out of the little school where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in a huge high school in Boston . The student body numbered about 2000 ? all boys  --  none of whom I knew , and none of whom , at first , showed the slightest desire to know me . As I drew near to the end of my high-school days I sensed , perhaps , that my father , who had graduated from West Point in the class of I BBB , would be pleased if I chose to go there too . So , out of the deep affection and admiration I felt for him , rather than from any strong desire to be a soldier , I decided to make the military my lift 's career . My parents gave me every chance , Knowing that the interruptions in my education had left me shakily prepared in some subjects , they sent me down to Washington to Swavely 's , a school which is now defunct , but which in those days had a fine ' reputation for preparing boys for West Point . In my first attempt at the entrance exams , I did little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face in the math tests , flunking geometry badly . It was a bitter disappointment to inc. but my parents took it calmly , and dug down in their pockets to send me back to Swavely 's for more seasoning . Up to that time I had not cared particularly whether I went to the academy or nat . After this failure , of which I was deeply ashamed , I was determined to go . For the next three months I worked as hard as I ever worked in my life , before or since . Day and night , Saturdays and Sundays included , I studied mathematics . In the examination that spring seven appointments were open , and twenty candidates were competing for them , so my chances were about one in three . But the months of hard study paid off . My average mark in algebra and geometry was 96 and I entered the academy that June . The year was MIS . As a cadet I did nothing particularly remarkable , either good or bad , as I recall . I made the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worth a damn . A horse I was riding bareback threw me over his head onto the wall I was trying to make him jump , which left me with a sore back that has plagued me , off and on , ever since . I got myself all lopsided trying to earn a letter by breaking the school shot-put record , which was very low , and I sang in the choir until I found out that , by teaching Sunday school , I could sleep an hour later on Sunday morning . I had some disciplinary troubles . Early in ray yearling year I showed the extremely poor judgment of getting caught by the commandant of cadets while hazing a plebe . I was causing him no physical anguish . I was merely " bracing " him  --  urging him to assume a more soldierly posture by pulling in his chin and sucking in his belly . But the commandant was a severe man , and for my sins I spent that fall and winter walking the area , an athletic exercise front which I derived no pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from various tactical officers whom I had displeased , and for a while I doubted the wisdom of having entered IVeSt Point at all . Somehow , though , all my troubles seemed to fade away at once . Somewhat to my surprise , I was made assistant manager of the football team , which meant I would be manager in my fourth year , and this took much of the sting out of my failure to make the grade as a player . In military I had no trouble . I was the top " make , " or noncom , at the end of my yearling year , and ended up as the cadet adjutant as a senior . I took on a lot of extracurricular activities , which may have cut down my class standing a few points , but I 've never regretted this , for I made many warm friendships in these extra activities which have endured for all these years . My scholastic ability was not spectacular , and I was graduated , as I remember , somewhere around the top of the middle third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not high enough to give me my choice of service . We named our preference in order of our class standing , and I chose the artillery , which I knew would please my father . But by the time they got to me , all the artillery vacancies had been filled by men higher up on the roster than I was , and I was given my second choice , which was infantry . I have never for a moment regretted the change . To my mind , the highest service a man can perform is to lead other men in battle . It requires of him competence and courage of the highest order , and it develops in him a deep and abiding love for those whose lives are entrusted to his hands  --  love that creates in him a complete willingness to sacrifice his own life , if need be . To my way of thinking , there never was a great battle commander in all history who did not feel this deep love for his men . On the field of battle all men 's lives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , and the commander who through stupid tactics or callousness drives his men to slaughter against an objective that is not worth the cost is not a leader , but a butcher and a fool . I remember a bitter joke that went the rounds of the Army soon after World War 1 , a conflict which gave to history many prize examples of men 's lives being thrown away needlessly . There was a staff meeting before a big attack , and some division commander tapped with his riding crop on a little dot on the map , and said , " I 'd give ten thousand men to take that hill . " From the back of the room where stood die battalion commanders whose units ' would have to go against the hill , there came an ironic voice , " He 's a generous so-and-so , is n't he ? " I have never admired the commander who was generous with men 's lives , and 1 will go to my grave proud of the fact that on at least four occasions I have stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes which I was convinced would have resulted in needless butchery. 1 du not mean to convey the idea that 1 am an advocate of timidity on the battlefield . The timid commander , by prolonging combat unnecessarily , causes the death of as many men as does the reckless and foolhardy commander . Neither is a true battle leader , for the finest combat leader is the man who can accomplish his mission the quickest , with the least cost in blood to the men under his command . None of these thoughts were in my mind , of course , thirty-eight years ago when my class  --  the class of 1917 ? graduated six weeks early , just fourteen days after the United States had gOne to war against Germany . Within a week , with my second lieutenant 's bars shining on my shoulders , I was on my way to join the fight . At least I. thought I was . I had asked for assignment to the srd Infantry , down on the Mexican border . It was at full war strength , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form cadres for the divisions that were going overseas , and the rumor was that it was soon to be shipped intact to France The rumors ss -c wrong . It stayed on the Mexican border , and so did I , until September of 1918 , when , to toy bitter disappointment , I received orders to report back to West Point as an instructor in the Department of Modern Languages . To me , this was the death knell to my career . The last great war the world would ever sec was swiftly drawing to a dose . There would never be another . Once the Hun was beaten , the world would be safe for democracy forever . I took what steps I could to avoid the assignment . I wrote to the only friend I knew in Washington , a lieutenant colonel , and pleaded with him to get my orders countermanded . For a while I heard nothing . Then I got a telegram . Its tone was curt and it was signed by some officer who had replaced my friend . It told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth shut in the future . I reported to West Point expecting to teach Spanish , in which 1 was fairly fluent . They put me to teaching French to a secondyear class that knew more French than I did . I arrived there low in spirit to find the spirit of the rest of the faculty at an equally low ebb , for each man felt that by having no combat on his record , he had lost all chance for advancement . This urge to get into the ugh Ling was almost universal among career officers in W.W. I. Strangely though , this spirit did not bum so strongly in W.W. II . Then many officers seemed quite content to remain in Stateside jobs for the duration . Istayed at West Point six years as instructor in French and Spanish and later , under General MacArthur , as graduate manager of athletics . On the side , in order that I would not lose too much contact with the basic tools of my profession , I volunteered to teach special classes in tactics and weapons in the evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so finally orders came sending me to Fort Benning , to take the Company Officer 's Course . From there I went to China , to the 15th Infantry , whose second in command was one of the great soldiers , great patriots and great gentlemen of all time . Gen. George C. Marshall , who was then a lieutenant colonel . From China I C:1111C back to the States , to San Antonio and the 9th Infantry , for service with another great soldier-statesman , Gen. Frank R. McCoy , who , along with General Marshall , did much to shape and mold my career in later years . During this service in San Antonio came one of those opportunities which I look back on now as marking a turning point in my life . Though I had never beers a top competitor in any one sport , I was tough and agile and fairly competent in many of them , and my ambition at the time was to represent the Army in the Ma Olympics as a member of the pentathlon squad . My orders to star ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew I spoke fair schoolbook Spanish , asked inc to go with him to Nicaragua , as a member of a United States mission which was to supervise the elections in that strife-torn republic . On the one hand lay the chance to make some sort of name for myself as an Olympic athlete . On the other lay the opportunity to broaden my horizons and gain experience in a field that was new to me . At the age of thirty-three , I was almost finished as an athlete before I began ; but the job with General McCoy opened tip limitless vistas for the future in the field of military diplomacy . I have never regretted that I laid aside my Olympic ambitions and went with General McCoy . It was a definite milestone in my career , and I believe some guidance from above helped me to make the right decision . In Nicaragua , Mr. Henry Samson had already arranged a truce between the warring factions . It was our job to bring the belligerents together , rewrite the electoral laws , and to conduct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . Nut all the land was at peace , however , for Sandino , the bandit leader , was still active in the hills and there were many but skirmishes between his anny and the United States Marina . Whenever my duties would permit I would slip oil to fly with the marine pilots on scouting missions over the rebel country , a recreation which was mildly hazardous , for aircraft maintenance was none too dependable in that day . The single-engined planes would sometimes fall in the jungles , where pilot and observer , even if they escaped death in the crash , soon would be hacked to pieces by the machete-armed rebels . There in Nicaragua I saw marines in action for the first time and gained an abiding respect for their fighting qualities . Three of the young marines I met there , Captains Schilt , Lamson-Scribner and Chesty Puller , I was to serve with again , when I commanded the 8th Army in Korea . They were general officers then , but they had lost none of the drive and fire they had in Nicaragua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were probably potentially more hazardous than the jungle flights I took with the marines . The Nicaraguan lakes were full of monster crocodiles , wary creatures , but dangerous to a man alone . We hunted them by creeping up on them , crawling on our bellies through the slime , and we 'd have to shoot them just between those little knobs in which their eyes are set , which is all you can sec sticking up when they are in the water . It was a fine test of marksmanship , for it was all offhand shooting at unknown ranges , at a very small target , and you had to get in a brain shot to kill . 1 used a .30-06 , with an unusually wide iron-post front sight and a big peep sight , for much of the shooting was done late in the day when the light was dim . I have killed as many as seven in a day  --  fourteen-footers , with big wide bellies on them , weighing up to 11 ) 00 pounds . If you missed the brain , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would flip over on his back with his two little stubby front legs sticking up out of the water , floating there for about a minute before he sank We used to have big arguments about how long it took one to die , if you hit him just right . I said they died instantly . And once , to prove my point , when I had shot a fourteen-footer on land , 1 ran up and sat on him within ten seconds after the shot . There was n't a flicker out of him , but looking back on it now , I think it was a damn-fool thing to do . Some of the places I crawled through , wearing nothing but-shorts and shoes , I would n't wade through now wearing hip boots , for a thousand dollars . It was a lot of fun then . though it did cost me one treasured memento . My West Point ring slipped off my finger while stalking one big old bull and it 's still there somewhere , buried in the jungle muck . When that tour ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to come home overland . Unlike most general officers , who can find a dozen reasons why young subordinates can not be spared for off-beat adventures of their own , he agreed immediately and wrote our embassies along the route to give me what aid and comfort I might need . In the congenial company of a young lieutenant , Irvin Alexander , I set out . By bull cart , canoe , mule-hack , bus and train we made our way through El Salvador , Guatemala and Mexico , a three months ' journey . By the time I arrived in San Antonio , General McCoy had another job for me  --  this time as a member of the mission that was trying to conciliate a bitter dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay . After that service I went back to school , to the Field Officer 's Course at Fort Benning . General Marshall was assistant commandant then and Vinegar Joe Stilwell was teaching tactics , and under Marshall 's leadership the school had turned into one of the finest and most thorough advanced military courses in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with the asrd Infantry in the Canal Zone . Then I was sent to the Philippines as liaison officer to the insular government , and adviser to the governor general , Theodore Roosevelt , Jr . There I contracted a very severe case of dysentery , a complaint which was first diagnosed as cholera , for which they prescribed injections of horse serum . I proved to be allergic to horse serum and my hands and feet swelled up until they resembled footballs . This disaster was more than compensated for , though , by the deep friendship that grew up between me and that great soldier and great gentleman , Ted Roosevelt  --  a relation that was to grow warmer and deeper on the battlefields of World War II . With the accession to the presidency of Mr. Roosevelt 's cousin , Franklin D. , he was out of a job , and so was I , and I came back to the States by way of Europe , to spend two years at the Command and General Staff School at Leavenworth . With that course of study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCoy was commanding what was then a corps area , but is now a continental army , with headquarters at Chicago , and he offered me either the G -- t ? job , which is supply and logistics , or G-3 , which is opera , Lions and training . I took the job as G-3 and immediately worked , and worried , myself into a state bordering on collapse . My first task was to plan a big maneuver for the late summer of 1946 , and since most of the other G 's were older officers who long since had lost their enthusiasm for hard work , the burden of the whole thing fell largely on me . The big problem was to find open areas in that Midwcit farming country where troops could maneuver without ruining the crops , which were just coming to harvest . We had four divisions in the maneuver , plus the 7th Cavalry Brigade , mechanized , the daddy of our armored force of W.W. 11 and the most modern clement we had in the field . I would first reconnoiter by air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then would go over the ground on foot . Then I 'd go home and toss and turn all night , visualizing a thousand angry farmers chasing me with pitchforks , because their crops had been ruined . I knew that if I fouled up on this thing my career as a soldier would be shot . Fortunately , though , it went off all right , and afterward General Marshall , who had a brigade in the maneuver , came to me and said a few kind and complimentary words that boosted my spirits more than if he 'd pinned a medal on my chest . After that it was back to school for me , to the Army War College , the most advanced course we had at that time . When that two-year tour was over , 1 was ordered to the Presidio of San Francisco , as G-9 of the 4th Army . The caldron of war was bubbling then all around the world . In Europe , Hitler was mouthing his insane doctrines , and every day , on the West coast , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Golden Gate , loaded with aviation gas and scrap steel . We knew what that meant , and were powerless to stop it , just as we knew that in Europe the big explosion was soon to come . It came in 1939 , and still remember the frantic message we got from Washington . " Hitler has invaded Poland , " it said . " Take all necessary measures . " We got a good laugh out of that , for we did n't know what the hell measures we could take in San Francisco that would have any effect on a war in Poland , We did take some steps , though , that were of great value to us later , when we went to war with Japan , I wrote the scena rio for a big maneuver . Its basic assumption was that the Pacific Fleet had been destroyed at Pearl Harbor , and three enemy armies were landing on the West Coast . The problem was to test how well and quickly we could bring men and supplies by rail from the East in sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan was instantaneous and vociferous . I was told that my basic assumption  --  that the Pacific Fleet had been destroyed  --  was so fantastic that it was not a proper premise on which to base an exercise of this scope . With the backing of the War Department , though , we went ahead . Top railroad men from throughout the country left their desks to run the troop and cargo trains through the three great bottlenecks in our transcontinental rail system  --  the holding and reconsignment points at Spokane , Ogden and San Bernardino . Every troop and cargo train was actually dispatched and spotted , and we learned where our weaknesses lay , and how to correct them . Two years later , when the Pacific Fleet had been temporarily knocked out at Pearl Harbor , and men and munitions were pouring across the con-ontinent , this knowledge came in very handily . Soon after that maneuver I again was or . dered to South America , General Marshall , who was soon to take office as Chief of Staff , went to Brazil as head of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could expect from our oldest and strangest Latin-American ally in the event we got into the war with Germany . Following that mission , which ended happily for us , and unhappily , 1 trust , for the thousands of Germans who had infiltrated Brazil , General Marshall went to Washington as Chief of Staff and I followed soon after . IkSily job was in the War Plans Division . It was fascinating work , but I preferred troop duty to a staff job , and I kept asking to be assigned to an active unit . Finally , the Chief of Infantry called me in and told me he had an assignment for me  --  if I wanted it  --  commanding a new regiment of native troops which was being formed in the Philippines . Again , I think , some power from above came to my aid in making a decision . Not quite knowing why , 1 turned it down . That action certainly shaped the course of my future life , for if I had gone out to the Philippines I certainly would have been killed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early December , 19,1-1 , when I was sent down to Benning to take a refresher course .

The next morning ! was back at my desk in the old Munitions Building in Washington . And there I stayed , and stayed , sending in one request after another , asking to be assigned to troops . Every day 1 would go in to see Bedell Smith , General Marshall 's staff secretary , and ask what word he had for me . Bedell was sympathetic , but not ton sympathetic , for he also was doing all he could to break away and get into the war . Finally , one day when I stuck my head in Bedell 's office and asked , " Any word ? " he nodded . " Yes , " he said . " This morning General Marshall said , and I quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him hanging around outside my door any more . When I have same-thing for him , I 'll send for him . ' " That cooled me down considerably , and I went back to my duties . There were the usual planning duties , but , in addition , I had a little extra job thrown in . Every morning at five o'clock I 'd get up , assemble all the dispatches that had come in during the night from all over the world , and digest them into a brief summary , with maps and sketches . This summary had to be on the desks of General Marshall , the Secretary of War , Mr. St imson , and the President , by eight o'clock daily . Then I 'd get on with my regular work until ten or eleven o'clock that night , a routine that left me a little hollow-eyed . Early in February I got a call to General Marshall 's office , The famous old 82nd Division of World War I was being reactivated , he told me . General Bradley was to take command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That put life into the flagging spirits of the old mare . Those orders meant combat . They also meant a first , if temporary , star . I got word at eleven o'clock . At one o'clock I was high-tailing across Memorial Bridge , bound for Camp Claiborne , Louisiana , where the lAnd 's cadre was assembling . After twenty-five years in the Army I was off to war at last . It turned out to be enough war to last a reasonable man a life- time , and of a form of which I 'd never dreamed .
