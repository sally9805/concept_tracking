txt Many major differences between Moscow and Belgrade remain and in his latest encounter with Communist Party Boss Nikita S. Khrushchev , President Tito of Yugoslavia does not seem to have budged in his refusal to become a disciplined member of the Kremlin-led " socialist camp . " But a reading of the communiqu ? produced after the two leaders ' highly hush-hush rendezvous at an unspecified spot in Romania suggests that Moscow got slightly more'out of the latest duel than the Yugoslays . Ever since last fall 's events in Hungary , the Soviets and the satellites have been accusing the Yugoslays of upsetting the " unity " of " the workers ' international movement " and creating a split rejoiced in by " Western imperialists . " The YugoslaVs have rejected the charge , while at the same time refusing to subscribe to Soviet-dictated ideas of a dominant Soviet example and leadership in the socialist world . Basic Gap Unbridged The communiqu ? on the new Tito-Khrushchev meeting suggests that neither side gave ground on the basic gap between them . The Kremlin 's attitude is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aid , and support of the Soviet Union , must join the Soviet bloc . Yugoslavia remains willing to give the Soviet Union all due acknowledgment as a pioneer among Communist states and to support it as the powerful exponent of an alternative foreign policy to that pursued by the West ? the Tito-Khrushchev ' agreement dealt mainly with the basic problems of the current international situation  --  but not to accept its compulsive leadership . All this is reflected in the communiqu ? and in the circumstances of the meeting which produced it . This time there was nine of the pretense about " vacation trips " and none of the junketing and hunting expeditions familiar to such occasions hitherto . This time the two leaders met not as host and guest but as delegates at a halfway house between their two capitals . This , in itself , signified a cooler , more formal approach than the previous jolly get-togethers amid the island splendors of Brioni and the Crimea . The communiqu ? recorded in general terms the ground covered by the talks , but contained none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordial " atmosphere customary . in reports of meetings between Soviet and satellite Communist leaders . In a normal situation the document would be a completely innocuous one . But in the special situation of Soviet-Yugoslav relations and against the uneasy background of more than a year during which the Soviets have switched from invective to charm as they from time to time thought fit , the Yugoslays appear to have conceded more than they have gained . Promise Reaffirmed They gained  --  for what its worth  --  a paper reaffirmation of the continued force of the joint declarations of Belgrade in 1955 and Moscow in 1956 on development of relations between the U.S.S.R. and Yugoslavia . Both had seemed to the Yugoslays to count for little in Soviet estimates since last fall . But , in fact , it costs Mr. Khrushchev nothing to say again that he favors the development of socialism in each coun try on its own chosen and suitable lines and that he will not intrude on Yugoslav internal affairs . There was agreement on both sides that they would strive for removal of the obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideological differences still dividing the Titoists from the Soviets  --  which stand in the way of better relations . Cooperation ' Urged Even more significant is the agreement on the . need for a general strengthening of the " unity and fraternal cooperation " of the Communist and workers parties and the " unity " Of the international workers movement . This is Moscow language and a stress new to the documents written by the Yugoslays in conjunction with other Communist parties . This suggests that the Yugo-slays have agreed with the Soviets at least not to pursue their old arguments and criticisms of the policies and " errors " of other parties in public . To this extent Marshal Tito , while continuing to avoid any direct involvement with the Soviet bloc , and preserving to all outward appearance his delicate poise on a tightrope between East and West , seems inevitably to concede a measure of implicit approval , not to a merely pious principle of unity among all those whose aims approximate with his own but to one fostered by the Soviet Union for its own Soviet objectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded by Fitzroy Maclean 's new book on Marshal Tito , Stalin dangled the promise of an aluminum plant in front of the Yugoslays . After the ' 48 split Moscow canceled all its economic aid to - Yuugoslavia. - A year ago the Soviet Union pledged the Yugoslays a credit of $170,000,000 for construction of an aluminum and hydroelectric project at Niksic , in Montenegro . The Soviets went back on their word after their suppression of the Hungarian revolution had brought into the open a head-on clash between Marshal Tito and the Kremlin . A month ago , again hopeful of drawing the Yugoslays closer to the Soviet bloc , they offered to consider restoration of the program . These negotiations have just ended and all that the balky Yugoslays have got out of them is an " agreed " postponement involving a start and a completion of the work two years later than the original promise envisioned . Marshal Tito 's private reflections may well be that the Soviet methods have changed little in this decade .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
