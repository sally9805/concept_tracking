The last time Henrique Baptista Duffles Teixeira Lott , 64 , saw the U.S. , he was an obscure brigadier general , attached to the Brazilian embassy in Washington . This week , ten years later , he returns as the tough , seasoned boss of the Brazilian armed forces , and democracy 's strong right arm in Brazil . As he goes off for three weeks of sightseeing , mostly military , from Cape Canaveral to West Point to Fort Ord in California , the U.S. will get acquainted with the man who will play a key role-either as candidate or moderator-in Brazil 's presidential election next year . <P> Often invited to visit the U.S. earlier , Lott replied that " conditions did not permit . " He referred to a group of troublesome Brazilian militarists who have obeyed him only grudgingly ever since 1955 , when he called out troops loyal to him in a " preventive coup , " forestalling a plot by some other officers and ensuring the inauguration of President Juscelino Kubitschek . For the past four years Lott has disciplined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiercely loyal cadre of junior officers by promoting them up from the ranks . <P> The blue-eyed grandson of English and Dutch immigrants , Lott would like to be President . He has a following of leftist nationalists who admire his pronouncements favoring land reform and the socialistic state oil monopoly . He himself is the sort of nationalist who opposes diplomatic relations with the U.S.S.R. , wins conservative admiration as a stabilizing force , warmly admires the U.S. He is hoping to get the support of Kubitschek 's Social Democrats . <P> But Lott runs a poor second in voter polls to Jnio Quadros , the shaggy reformer from Sao Paulo who recently accepted the nomination of the conservative National Democratic Union ( TIME , March 9 ) . If Lott stays out of the race , he will have the demanding job of keeping army tempers cool during the fiery heat of a Brazilian campaign . He frankly believes that " besides defense , the army has a great responsibility for national unity and social order . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
