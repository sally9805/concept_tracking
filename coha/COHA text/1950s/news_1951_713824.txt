txt General of the Army Douglas said here last night that the Administration 's Wake Island documents , made public yesterday , had " just about as much bearing on the problem of Korea today as would a report , on the military operations on , Bunker Hill . " The deposed Pacific commander also revealed earlier yesterday that he never had seen the report on Korea made by Lieut . Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer in 1947 , which urged President Truman to arm the South Koreans against Communist invasion . Both of General 's statements were made through his chief aide , Maj. Gen. Courtney Whitney . Regarding the Wake Island meeting , General Whitney added that General " did not know that notes were being taken " at his conference with President Truman . General also had been assured by Charles Ross , the President 's late press secretary , that " no record would be made of the proceedings , " General Wl.itney declared . The disclosures on the Wake Island and Wedemeyer reports were made on the eve of General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees investigating the President 's dismissal of General from his Pacific commands . General Whitney said he had " no reason to doubt " that five copies of a document about the Wake Island conference had been sent to General on Oct. 19 and that a receipt for them had been signed for by one of the General 's aides . He added that " no attention was paid to it in Tokyo . " " It was put in the files because a communique had been issued after the conference , " General Whitney said . General Whitney had received a copy of the Wake Island report , he said , from Senator Richard B. Russell , Democrat , of Georgia , who will be chairman of the joint Senate committee meeting . Referring apparently to the report received in Tokyo , General Whitney said he did not know " whether its the same as the one we received or not . " " No mention was made by anybody of any surreptitious notes taken behind closed doors , " General Whitney declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no records would be made of the proceedings but , be that as it may , General did n't read the document in Tokyo and when I took a copy I ' received from Senator Russell tonight , his comment was that he did n't have time to go into it . " General Whitney asserted that while " surreptitious " might be the wrong word for the note taking , " it was made covertly behind closed doors and not in the open . " The Wedemeyer report discussed earlier by General Whitney was made public day before yesterday by the joint Senate committees . Askd if General felt he should have received a copy of the Wedemeyer report , General Whitney declined to express an opinion . He said that in a strategic sense Korea was under General 's command at the time of that report . General Whitney said his chief has been devoting his " sole thoughts " to the Far Eastern situation , and has " held himself above " all personal issues . Asked about published reports that General attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acheson , General Whitney replied : " I am inclined to discount this completely . I never heard any such expression from General , who probably has given less thought to the question of his being relieved than those of you here in this room . He concerns himself solely with issues of our national position in Korea , and has given little thought to any blame or to the circumstances surrounding his being relieved . " General Whitney said he would accompany his chief to Washington today . They will leave the Waldorf-Astoria at 7:30 A. M. for New York International Airport at Idlewild , Queens . At 8:10 o'clock they are scheduled to take off for Washington in the four-engined plane , the Bataan , in which the party flew here from Tokyo . According to General Whitney , he and his chief will fly back to New York this afternoon or evening , and if General 's presence is required beyond today they will commute between the two cities . General Whitney said no documents would be taken to Washington . General is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East without having supporting documents , " General Whitney added . The aide said that General would give the committee members any assistance he could . General is " feeling fine  --  never felt better in his life , " according to General Whitney . After the hearings , General Whitney said , General " will continue to take a very firm stand and will make as many public appearances as possible . " He said the general had " innumerable invitations and will make as many public appearances as possible . " The aide said that General believed that " many per-1 sons want to hear his views and feels that in the public interest he should respond accordingly as far as he can . " General Whitney said that . General was on active status without military assignment , and could be ordered anywhere by President Truman . He sad he had never heard of General AraeArthur giving any " great thought " to the question of retirement .                @ @ @ @ @
