FOR over a quarter of a century I have lived in Europe , and , perhaps because of the physical distance between me and my country , when other aspects of American life were lost in vagueness , America 's tradition of individual freedom re- , mained singularly clear . During those KAY BOYLE is the author of some twenty-five books , including , ' most recently , " Thirty Short Stories , " " His Human Majesty , " and " The Smoking Mountain . " She is the wife of Joseph M. Franckenstein , a former Foreign Se ; vice officer with the Department of State , and has spent the last five years in Germany , where she was a correspondent for the New Yorker . She has made frequent visits to France to collect political and other data for use in the book she is now completing on contemporary France . years my forbears acquired a special stature , and perspective lent them a meaning possibly greater than was actually theirs . For instance , I have always believed that my great-great-grandfather on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served on George Washington 's staff in the Revolution , was a man who felt so deeply- about political freedom that he volunteered to give his life for it . I believe , moreover , that in making the choice he did , in the time he made it , he not only played a part in the creating of a nation but accepted as well the individual responsibility of establishing a tradition of social freedoms , and I am proud he made that choice . There are others among my , people who belong to America as well as to me , and through the years , their lives have been part of ' my own . The 're was my great-grandfather Moore , a doctor , who after much thought and with some misgivings left-Philadelphia with his family and settled in Kansas at a time when the Indian fires burned along the horizon at night He was " almost overcome by the vastness " that confronted him , but he recognized it as a site for individual endeavor , and winter and summer he traveled by horse and buggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - His favorite child , my mother 's mother , was a school teacher at sixteen , and raised her own children on the Kansas prairies , and I think of her as a pioneer as fearless as any who broke new soil . I know that her eldest daughter , Nina E.- Allender , the official cartoonist of the National Woman 's Party and a staunch fighter for the American wo= man 's franchise and her rights before the law , belongs as well to a tradition to which I am committed by pride . I shall tell my grandchildren , as I have told my children , of the Children 's Crusade that crossed America in the early twenties  --  a straggling crusade of children and their mothers who walked across the continent to Washington to petition , the White House to set their fathers free . When , the marching children , some ill , all weary , came through Cincinnati , my mother opened our doors to them , and she washed and fed them , and , when they left she walked to the outskirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading . " My father is in prison for expressing his opinion " , or " I have never seen my father . He is still in prison because he did n't believe in war . " I HAVE SPOKEN of these forbears of mine to Europeans , and their presence with me on foreign soil helped establish a common tongue between us I have talked of my- father 's father , Jesse Peyton Boyle , whose people Caine from Ireland , and who was a man of passionate opinions , furiously expressed . He was a lawyer and the founder of the West Publishing Company in St. Paul , and his belief in the rights of the American male citizen brought him daily to the point of apoplexy In the years I ' lived abroad my grandfather , my mother ; and the others were there in explanation and justification of the things I said about - America They were present when Europe looked to us for liberation from the Nazi armies , and they were there when that liberation came They went with me , these ardent believers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Franco Spain and into the processing centers of Western Germany , where refugees from the East waited for asylum . Indeed , it would perhaps be more accurate to say that I went to these places because my forbears were with me , and that it was they who led me there . But by 1949 a change had come into the faces of Europeans when they spoke of America , and my forbears seemed to feel uneasy in their revolutionary roles . In 1951 scattered editorials appeared in the foreign press , and Europeans asked curiously , incredulously , about " the democratic tension " , in America . Which of , the basic freedoms , was the voice of one man condemning , they asked , and December 12 , 1953 which did he honor , and  --  far graver  --  which of the freedoms could survive his daily abuse ? In late 1952 and early 1953 the press of England , Germany , France ? although never one organ of the Communist Party  --  spoke bitterly of this man , an American , whose name was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence from either of these . One German newspaper editor , a cloSe friend for several years , and a tough , seasoned fighter for democracy , struck the table with his fist and said : " If there is another side in America as articulate as this one man 's , - then get more and more evidence of it to us over here . I do n't want to fill my paper with the reports of his accusations , with accounts of the suicides of honest men . I want to give the German people another America , an America as dynamic and eloquent as his . If his voice does n't speak for your countrymen , then let us hear other voices ringing out . Only Einstein , once a German like me , spoke loudly enough for us to catch the echo over here . " " DO N'T GO back to America now , " a Paris concierge I have known for fifteen years said to me in the spring . " It is n't your country any more " ; and because of the silence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my ances : tors had died . As she washed the tiles of the entrance hall or peeled the potatoes for the soup at night , the concierge spoke of one man only , and it was not Panay or Laniel or even Mend  --  s-France . It was an Xmerican , and his name was McCartair , and if he did n't , like the look of your face , he 'd subpoena you right in off the street , she told me . " Stay away from America the way the French who could manage it stayed away when fascism was in the saddle here . It does n't last , Jascism . It 's a corpse that the ambitious try to pump the blood of life in every now and then . The French people will see it does n't get any more transfusions in a- hurry here , " she said When I spoke of other Americans to her , she shook her head , and she poured us each a glass of wine in sympathy .
