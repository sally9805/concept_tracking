On swirl-dimpled , symbol-specked Weather Bureau maps , the storm gathered in classic pattern : polar air and Gulf of Mexico winds butted along a line that curled like an overturned roller coaster ; winds overhead fluxed cold and warm . Translated into ground-level consequences last week , the winter 's most severe storm heaved snow , sleet , gales , tornadoes and floods over most of the U.S. west to the Rockies , by week 's end was responsible for more than 100 deaths . <P> Heaviest single toll was in Pittston , Pa. , where the ice-clogged Susquehanna River tore away a railroad bed , gnawed a soft . hole into the weakened river bank , finally ate through a ceiling of the Pennsylvania Coal Co. ' s big River Slope Mine . Without warning , 45 anthracite miners were washed waist-high by tomb-cold rising water . While emergency crews dumped telephone poles , bales of hay and even empty railroad gondola cars into the hole to block the water , 33 miners threaded through abandoned tunnels and shafts to safety . The other twelve were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and Ohio , record rains ( 5 in. in 24 hours in Columbus ) swished over frozen ground , ran off into rivers like the Olentangy , the Kokosing , the Chagrin and Racoon Creek , swelled them until they overflowed to flood scores of cities and towns , batter buildings with massive hunks of ice . Ohio 's Governor Mike Di Salle and Pennsylvania 's David Lawrence declared emergencies . In Columbus Mrs. Betty Montgomery , 59 , a wheelchair-bound invalid , sat stolidly at her window , watched the Scioto River rising up her wall . When flood water reached the first floor , she tied a string to the trigger of a .22 cal . rifle , aimed it at her head and pulled the string . In south Buffalo an ice dam backed up Cazenovia Creek until a wall of water finally burst the ice ; the resulting wave swept automobiles underwater , ripped a 515-ft. - long grain boat from its moorings in the Buffalo River and slammed it into the steel-girdered Michigan Avenue Bridge . The bridge shivered and collapsed . <P> As storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Weather Bureau mapped a heavy cold wave that all but froze the floods in their tracks .
