When the U.S. Air Force began burrowing into the wreckage of German planes in 1942 , it got a shock . Engine mounts , wing spars and other parts for the planes had not been made by slow machining or welding , as were those in U.S. planes . They had been quickly forged in one big piece , apparently by enormous hydraulic presses that dwarfed any in the world . The big press was a secret production weapon that had enabled the Germans to mass-produce planes in such big quantities . <P> After V-E day , a U.S. technical mission raced the Russians to grab the presses . The U.S. got two , which exerted a forging pressure of 16,500 tons , three times as much as any operating U.S. press ( although , at the time , the Mesta Machine Co. was making an 18,000-tonner ) . But the Russians snatched the world 's largest , a 33,000-tonner . The U.S. later turned the two German presses over to Bohn Aluminum and Alcoa to experiment with aluminum forgings . But while the Russians put their big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had designed , a U.S. big press program lagged . Last week it got into high gear . <P> A House subcommittee okayed an Air Force program to spend $389 million on 20 big forging and extrusion presses . * Henry J. Kaiser , who has been plugging for the presses for 2 years , got a contract to build a $17 million plant at Newark , Ohio to house two of them-a 25,000-tonner and a 35,000-tonner to be built by E. W. Bliss at a total cost of $14 million . Only two weeks ago , Alcoa got a letter of intent to operate a 35,000-tonner and a 50,000-tonner to be built by United Engineering &; Foundry and Mesta Machine . Wyman-Gordon has a contract to operate two similar presses which Loewy Construction will make . <P> The Air Force also plans to have the Harvey Machine Co . ( TIME , Dec. 24 ) operate two more in California , from United and Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton . Dow Chemical Co. may also get one for magnesium forgings . The big presses have already proved their worth , even though the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Wyman-Gordon press has been operating 16 hours a day , and the two German presses are now both in use . <P> How much will the big presses speed up plane production ? No one really knows . But when some of the presses get into operation in mid-1953 , they will mass-produce structural plane parts in much the same way that auto parts are now turned out . The forged parts will be stronger than those made by present methods . Some experts estimate that the big presses may save as much as 10% of the cost of the bare air frame , or , in the present big program , billions . <P> <P> *A forging press shapes a hot aluminum billet by bringing two dies together under enormous pressure ; an extrusion press shapes the metal by ramming hot metal into stationary dies .
