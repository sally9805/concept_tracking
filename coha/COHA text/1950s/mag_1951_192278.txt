Manhattan 's waning art season put forth a bright , belated bloom last week-a 57th Street show of sophisticated , slaphappy paintings by Writer-Illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans , 53 . Done mostly with gouache , " because it comes in charming little French jars and does n't smell , " they spoofed and also celebrated the drifting , uppercrust , good-time world that Bemelmans inhabits . Their style mingled childlike cheer and simplicity with penknife stabs of caricature . <P> A blocky , bubbly ex-Tyrolean , Bemelmans has turned out a score of illustrated books , has won a snug niche in current popular art . His firmly funny India ink lines are backed by broad , patternmaking blobs of color that are cool as summer showers . He is like Raoul Dufy , James Thurber and Peter Arno tossed into salad and marinated in strong dark beer . <P> Bemelmans moved to the U.S. in 1914 , joined the Army and volunteered to work in a Government insane asylum . " I expected those people to stand on their heads and make funny faces , " he recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed my whole life . I decided anything at all would be better than that . " Since then he has been resolutely gay . He lives in Manhattan , explains that the city never gets him down " because I regard it as a curiosity ; I do n't let myself get caught in the wheels . " Waving his arm at the cluttered little table where he writes and paints , Bemelmans happily cries : " This is all play , you know . "
