One sunny afternoon last week , 31 U.S. Sabre jets , commanded by Colonel Benjamin Preston , let down over " MIG Alley " ( the northwestern corner of Korea ) for a quick look . " Bandits at eleven o'clock , " Preston barked over the radio , meaning : enemy planes ahead , a little to the left . The enemy formation was unusual : twelve twin-engined TU2 bombers and 18 propeller-driven LA9 fighters ( both Russian World War II types ) , guarded by 16 MIG-153 . " Tallyho ! " yipped Preston , and led his fast jets in for the kill . <P> The enemy formation was believed to have been sent to cover a Communist attack on U.N.-held islands near the mouth of the Yalu . In any case , the lumbering , thin-skinned bombers were slaughtered like sheep . After the battle , eight TUs , three LAs and one red-nosed MIG had been downed ; two of the Sabres suffered minor damage , but all returned safely to their base . It was the first time that Red bombers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombers and the one MIG were destroyed by Major George A. Davis Jr. , a slight , blue-eyed Texan who raised his total kills to six and became the fifth ace of the Korean war ( he shot down seven enemy planes in the Pacific during World War II ) . It was the day before his 31st birthday . He and his flight-mates feted their victory with roast beef and whisky . <P> Next day the Communists won one of their few victories : knocking down three early-model Australian Meteor jets and one U.S. F-80 , and losing only two MIGs . Cease-fire and lull were two words that airmen on both sides could not hear and did not heed .
