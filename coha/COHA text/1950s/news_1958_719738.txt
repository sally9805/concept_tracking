Overall employment of Aeroquip has climbed about 10% from the mid-February low , Mr. Hurst said , and " appears quite stable . " Contributing to his optimism , Mr. Hurst said , is the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fiscal year began last October , this operation " has progressed quite well and was in the black in March and April " Aeroquip makes flexible hose lines with detachable self-sealing couplings for the heavy equipment industries . Of the company 's line , its teflon hoses are doing " exceptionally well , " Mr. Hurst said . These hoses , first brought out in 1955 , were introduced last year in the field of chemical processing and now are being installed on most new airliners being built in this country , he added . The company 's products are also used by such heavy capital goods producers as the farm implement and road building equipment makers . Orders in the company 's industrial division are filled " almost in days , " he said , and its aircraft division is shipping 75% of its orders within 15 days after they are received Production in the heavy industrial goods field " still is depressed , " Mr. Hurst stated , but the aircraft industry has " quite a bit more activity . " Aeroquip 's production for the missile field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has completed prototype production for hollow blades for gas turbines , he added . These are not yet in production . Their first market will be in aircraft , but they can be used also in ship propulsion and for various industrial purposes . Mr. Hurst said he is confident Aeroquip will be among the first to reflect general business recovery . He feels the trend among heavy capital goods producers to reduce inventories " has just about run its course . " Aeroquip was one of the first to feel these cutbacks , he said , and will quickly benefit when customers start building up inventories again .
