Warm in the April sunshine , London 's upper-crust horseplayers crowded the club enclosure at Kempton Park Race Track . Peeresses in Dior tweeds appraised each other when they were done appraising the ponies . Their husbands , in Saville Row suits , lifted black bowlers when they passed near their Queen . But there was one extraordinary note in the picture , more jarring than a peer in jeans : the ladies and gentlemen were all clutching the Daily Worker . Deprived by the newspaper strike ( TIME , April 18 ) of Sporting Life and all the London dailies , British racing fans were taking their tips from the columns of London 's Communist daily ( circ. 83,376 ) . The paper was so in demand that on the black market it fetched 1 shilling ( six times the regular price ) . Even Bernard Marmaduke Fitzalan-Howard , 16th Duke of Norfolk , Earl Marshal of England and a steward of the Jockey Club , bought a copy . ( He held it as if it were a week-old fish . ) Workers ' Weakness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . Alf Rubin , 38 , the Worker 's wide-eyed little cockney handicapper , who prints his picks under the name of " Cayton , " is the best in the business . Last year , a $2 bet on every one of his choices would have brought a profit of better than $160-a remarkable performance . Alf and his paper make a strange combination . Politics , to him , is a vast irrelevance ; horse racing , to the Worker , is a questionable capitalist diversion. * But back in 1935 , the paper needed to boost circulation , and the Worker decided to cater to a weakness of the workers . The editors looked around for a horse handicapper , and there was Alf . Then unemployed , he had been picking winners ever since he was nine ( when he selected Coronach , 11 to 2 , in the 1926 Derby ) . He was no Communist , he told the Worker people ; he did n't even vote . Still , the end seemed to justify the means . Proper Fun . Alf never finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm too busy working out the form and collecting information around town . " ) But he admits he has done pretty well . Says he : " Nothing else interests me . Stick with me , bet within your means , and you 'll have fun . " One afternoon last week , Alf gave the clubhouse punters three successive winners : Elladora , a 6-to-1 shot ; Grand Statute , a 10-to-1 surprise ; and Running Water , a 3-to-1 stake racer that survived a tough stretch battle and a foul claim to take the purse . A 1 ( $2.80 ) parlay on the three paid $862.40 . It was almost too much for one conservative gentleman . " From now on , " said he , as he tried to revive himself in the bar , " I 'm in favor of coexistence . " <P> <P> * Even though it is still popular in Russia .
