At 12:06 p.m. the sirens in Washington began their drawn-out wail , warning that " enemy H-bombers ' ' were approaching the capital as part of the fourth nationwide civil defense test , " Operation Alert 1957 . " Like millions of other Americans in major cities across the U.S. , the President of the U.S. was ready to play his part in the nuclear-age fire drill . At 2:10 p.m. , hatless , wearing a tan , double-breasted summer suit , he walked across the White House 's south lawn , and for the first time boarded his new royal-blue and white Bell Ranger helicopter. * Serious of mien , the President strapped himself in the four-place whirlybird next to White House Secret Service Chief Jim Rowley . The aircraft rose from the lawn , hovered above a cluster of photographers , then skimmed southwestward past the Washington Monument , followed by four other copters carrying some 20 White House staffers , including Ike 's personal physician , Howard McC . Snyder . <P> At 3:22 p.m. a " five-megaton H-bomb fell on Union Station , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that time , reported civil defense officials , the President was " well out of danger " at a secrecy-shrouded mountaintop " Emergency White House " ( one of several alternate command posts ) less than 200 miles away . There , with his staff , he settled down to direct dry-run command operations under a simulated " unlimited state of emergency . " One by one , the bulletins flashed in over the closed-circuit emergency communications system : enemy aircraft were striking south from Alaska and Canada ; 100 U.S. cities were blasted in atomic attack . Adding a lighter note , Mamie and Ike 's grandchildren arrived by car from Washington , and next morning all drove off to the President 's Gettysburg farm for a weekend of golf and relaxation . <P> <P> Last week the President also : <P> Noted the " amazing " charge by Soviet Dictator Nikita Khrushchev ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) that U.S. efforts to develop a " clean " H-bomb amounted to " a stupid thing , " replied promptly that " avoidance of mass human destruction in an atomic war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less than the aim of eliminating the possibility of war itself . Such efforts-to which the U.S. is dedicated-are and will be continuing . " <P> Reluctantly signed into law Congress ' $1,990,000,000 omnibus housing bill . His principal objections : builder-inspired provisions that 1 ) permit inflationary lower down payments , e.g. , $300 instead of $700 on a $10,000 house , on home mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration , 2 ) boost the Administration 's original housing budget by 104% to almost $2 billion . The President noted that the added spending was not mandatory , implying that he might take his time putting the new law into full effect . <P> Received Publisher Malcolm Forbes , 37 , eager beaver New Jersey Republican candidate for governor , and his photogenic family ( four sons , aged four to ten , and two-year-old daughter Moira ) . Forbes 's visit came at his own urgent request only three weeks after his Democratic opponent , Governor Robert Meyner , had at the Governors ' Conference edged his way into pictures with Honor Guest Eisenhower for the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
