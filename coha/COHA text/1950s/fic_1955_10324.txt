F-f-first time they 've been out since they heard Jack 's b-b-brother got it in the Pacific . You w-will excuse me , wo n't you ? " He shook hands fast and backed away , still smiling into the face of the dumb , hard-looking man , who was staring at him , puzzled and uneasy . " S-s-swell to see you both , " Bunty crowed triumphantly , leading them to the far end of the bar . " I was shocked to hear about p-poor Dick . " " Stop being so crazy , Bunty . " Bunty waved to the bartender . " Gordon 's gin with w-w-water on the side this time , Ferd , and give my f-f-friends a beer and a ginger ale . That was the t-t-truth about the Traynors and the M-marines , you know . I was saving G-g-grandfather Traynor and Teddy Roosevelt at San Juan f-f-for my ace in the hole . It 's always easier to t-t-tell a lie if you can m-m-mix in some truth . " " Anyway , I thought that was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ale and grinned . " I thought I had nerve , but I doubt if I could pull that off . " " You 've got ch-ch-charms that I do n't . I could train you , Betsy , in n-n-no time at all . " Looking at him , Joe could see that he meant it . And Betsy  --  she was more impressed than ever . He decided to take a chance . He finished his beer and said , " I do n't mean to be cruel , but supposing your sucker had started to wonder about the Marines and that stammer ? " " A calculated risk . " Bunty chuckled . " S-s-sooner or later he would have caught on , but I t-t-took him by surprise . You 've g-got to take chances , my boy , if you w-w-want to succeed in this world . " Betsy said promptly , " I agree . " Joe sighed . A drop of moisture was glittering on the tip of Bunty 's nose ; he itched to tell him to wipe his nose and go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the lies . " " Why should you ? " Bunty raised his hands . " Even if I in/vented everything about m-myself , you should n't c-c-complain as long as it 's interesting . Besides , it 's revealing . You should be able to 1-1-learn about me , you being a journalist , even from my 1-1-lies . " " I do n't want to . I have enough trouble learning about my-self . " " But we 've g-g-got a lot in common . Think how we b-b-both live at home with our w-w-widowed mothers , giving them c-c-comfort and companionship . Is n't that why you admire us both so m-m-much , Betsy ? " " I despise mothers . Mine is a vain , lazy woman , a drag . She has no reason for existence . " Bunty laughed . " Ah , but your father ! " " He 's a person . You ca n't think of him as just a parent . " Perhaps , Joe thought , if he could get her away from Bunty for a while . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll put a nickel in the jukebox . " " If Bunty does n't mind . " " You two young people g-g-go right ahead and enjoy yourselves . I 'll just sit in a booth and w-w-warm my old bones by the gin . " As they walked to the dance floor Joe heard Bunty ordering . " Ferd , a double this time . And s-s-send it over to that booth . " It was different as soon as they were dancing together . Betsy was humming softly , her head just touching his shoulder , and she did not object when he held her tightly in his arms . She moved lightly , her body responding to his pressure . Glancing down , he could see the clear line of her scalp beneath her parted hair . A fresh , soapy fragrance drifted to his nostrils . He said to her , " I hate to seem like a crab . But he 's not for you , Betsy . Not even to run around with over the summer . " She tilted her head and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were were jealous if you were n't a little too  --  uh  --  too distant to feel jealous of someone like him . " " It 's not exactly jealousy . I just hate to see you taking in/struction from someone so despicable , admiring him , scheming with him . " She did not become angry , or even annoyed . " If only you knew him bettter , Joe . He 's suffered a lot , and he 's striking back  --  and I can understand that . Maybe you ca n't because you have n't suffered enough . He was expelled from Exeter , and from Dartmouth too . " If she 's going to be patient with me , he thought , there 's no reason for me to be patient indefinitely with her . " Has n't it occurred to you that those things might have been his fault ? Does everything a person does have to be excused because he was underprivileged or overprivileged ? " Betsy murmured mildly , " Well , I make allowances for your being so cynical . It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter . " " But I 'm not  --  " he began , and then stopped . If he attempted to defend himself she 'd laugh in his face . Instead he said , " You 're a sharp little tease . A sharp one . " She chuckled  --  gratefully , it seemed  --  and snuggled more closely in his arms . " You dance well . I 'm glad you came tonight . If only you were n't so  --  " " So what ? " " So paternal , I guess is what I mean . " And then of course it was spoiled , especially when the music stopped and they were left standing alone on the quiet floor . " We 'd better get back to Bunty , " he said . " After all , it 's his party . " When they sat down in the booth Bunty said , " You two d-d-danced as though you were c-celebrating your tenth weddinganniversary . V-v-very touching . " " Betsy tells me you were kicked out of Exeter . Mind telling why ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Go ahead , Bunty . " Betsy swirled the straw gently aroundp103her ginger ale . " You know you can say anything you want . Do n't be coy . " " I do n't want you to m-m-misinterpret , as Joe may . You see , I had a f-f-friend there , the closest friend I ever had . He knew everything about art , and he g-g-gave me books , took me to g-galleries , showed me how to use my hands . " " So that 's how you learned . Bunty does beautiful leather work , Joe . He 's making me a purse , did I tell you ? I keep at him to make use of his skill , instead of drinking so much . Show him your belt , Bunty . " " I 'd rather not . It 's not the kind of thing I w-w-want made fun of . " Joe said grimly , " Supposing I promise . " With a great show of modesty Bunty opened his jacket and hiked up his trousers so that they could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been quite painstakingly worked and was neither crude nor overelaborate . In fairness , Joe had to say so . " It 's one of my earlier p-p-pieces , " Bunty said . " I 've done b-b-better since . Anyway , this p-person was enormously sympathetic . He had no f-f-family himself , but he understood how it f-f-felt to have it on your b-back like a millstone . Oh , he had his own d-d-disastrous parents , a nouveau riche father like Betsy 's "  --  Joe glanced at Betsy when Bunty uttered these words , but she sat quietly , chewing her lower lip  --  " completely rough and uncultivated , and a d-d-domineering mother who made his life m-m-miserable with her demanding letters and the awful g-g-girls she tried to foist on him . " One day they f-f-found us in what they assumed was a c-c-compromising situation . They put him on p-p-probation  --  God knows what his f-f-father said when he found out  --  and they th-th-threw me out , because I was older and anyway I 'd n-never shown any appreciation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from asking with what he knew would be an irritating edge in his voice , " It was n't really a compromising situation , was it ? " " I 'm sorry if you m-m-missed the entire point . " " What difference does that make ? " Betsy asked angrily . " The terrible thing is that those people had to break up the friendship and make something dirty of it . " In this very moment of frustration and disgust  --  as Bunty was saying , " But Joe thinks m-maybe it was dirty , " and , " I 'm not r-r-really gay , Joe . Let 's have another d-d-drinkie "  --  it suddenlycame to Joe , like a revelation , how he could regain control over the situation  --  not tonight , but soon  --  and how he could expose Bunty for what he was . The idea , full-blown and unassailable ( if only he could put it into practice ) , was so satisfying , so calming , that he leaned back at ease and listened to Betsy say to the waiter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were busted , Betsy . " " I hit my mother up . Told her my allowance was used up and that I could n't ask Daddy for money for intimate things . " " You 're learning fast , are n't you ? " Joe remarked . He glanced across the table at Bunty . " Betsy was bragging that you were kicked out of Dartmouth also . Was there a friend there too ? " Bunty laughed briefly and then choked . With his handkerchief to his mouth , he spoke . " Nothing like that . It was just d-d-drinking  --  drinking and flunking . " " Why did you go to college anyway ? " " Money . Grandfather Traynor left a trust fund for my c-c-college education . I have to s-s-stay in school indefinitely to keep g-g-getting the interest . And Benedict does n't c-c-care if I show up for c-classes , or if I major in bird-watching or clock-repairing . They 're d-d-desperate for students , you know  --  besides , they should be p-p-proud to have a Traynor in the student body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're st-st-stuck with each other . There 's nothing left butp105some oil p-paintings and brass-studded 1-library tables in storageat the Lincoln warehouse , and a c-c-couple islands off Maine that we owe taxes on and ca n't afford to v-v-visit anyway . According to the w-will , Mother has to m-manage the money  --  which is f-f-funny in itself  --  but there 's nothing for her to m-manage if I 'm not enrolled in c-c-college . So she r-rocks on the porch and prays that Benedict w-wo n't do what Dartmouth did . " Bunty was getting drunk , Joe observed wearily , and he took advantage of the lull to invite Betsy to dance once again , after Bunty had explained that as a boy he had dropped , out of dancing class after two lessons because he abhorred physical contact . " We do dance like an old married couple , Joe . " Betsy laughed up at him . " Maybe that situation is n't irreversible . Maybe we 'll be dancinglike kids out on a date before the summer 's over . " " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she did n't seem to mean it , and in fact he had the feeling that , even if it was only a momentary warmth , she was more genuinely fond of him now than ever before . The jukebox stopped , and Betsy excused herself to go to the ladies ' room . There was no point in returning to the littered booth where Bunty sat alone , tearing a cigarette butt to shreds , so Joe crossed the floor to the men 's room himself ; but as he was standing at the washbasin , drying his hands on a paper towel , the door swung open and Bunty sauntered in . " We m-meet again . We seem fated to come together in m-m-men 's toilets . " " I did n't bring you in here this time . " " And I w-w-wo n't throw up this time . I w-wanted to talk toyou about Betsy  --  ca n't do it with her s-s-sitting there . " " Sorry . " Joe threw away the paper towel . " It 'll have to wait . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bunty shrugged as he closed his fly . " It 's up to you . "  | " Are n't you going to wash your hands ? " " Oh no . I 1-1-like the faint flavor of urine . You ca n't b-b-beat that rich , tangy goodness . " Joe heard Bunty 's hacking laugh echoing in the tiled lavatory as Bunty hurried after him . Betsy was seated in the booth when they returned . She burst out laughing as they approached her . Joe looked down uneasily at his front . " What 's funny ? " " I thought only women went to the bathroom together . " " I 've often w-w-wondered about that , " Bunty said . " I 've spent m-m-many a happy hour peeking through knotholes , t-trying to f-f-find out what girls do when they g-go to the toilet hand in hand . " Betsy was uncomfortable , but by now Joe was certain that she would object to almost nothing that Bunty said . She mumbled nervously , " It 's just small talk , mostly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was with us . J-j-just small talk . " " I used to know a French girl , " Joe said reminiscently , " named Marcelle . She lived at International House  --  she was a graduate student when I was a sophomore at Columbia . What reminds me of her is that she used to laugh at the fuss we make over separate accommodations for men 's and women 's lavatories . " He realized that he should stop right there , but he went on , impelled at first by what he thought of only as a desire to keep Bunty from talking any more . " She was very bright and very worldly , and we had lots of fun together , but in the end she turned out to be too old for me . " " Was she pretty ? " " Extremely . " As soon as Betsy asked the question he knew that that was what he had been angling for , but even faced with the knowledge that he was degrading himself by competing with Bunty for her admiration and respect  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself an object of pity in her eyes if that was what she really wanted  --  he continued to talk about Marcelle . " She was quite tiny , with enormous eyes and a really captivat/ing accent . She had an insatiable curiosity about American politics and American customs . I would have given anything to be able to show her all the things she wanted to learn . I had quite a crush on her , but I guess in the end I only bored her , and she gave up on me . The last I heard , she was running around with a young neurologist , and I suppose if he married her  --  which of course was out of the question for me  --  she got to stay in this country . " " Did you k-k-kiss her ? " He looked up sharply from the matches that he had been striking and dropping in the ashtray . Bunty was leering , not at him but at Betsy , and he had a sudden suspicion , sharp as a ' knife wound , that she had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as a pretext to make it clear that he was fully informed on everything there was to know . Betsy 's face wore a troubled and embarrassed smile , but whether the embarrassment was for herself , for him , or for Bunty , he could not tell  --  and so it could neither strengthen his suspicion nor put it at rest . " Yes , " he said slowly , " I did . " And as he closed his eyes he could feel Marcelle 's feverish , animal-warm kisses on his lips . They had kissed  --  he remembered each occasion  --  in a taxi on Riverside Drive , in the 116th Street station of the IRT , and in the darkened doorway of International House . What was most painful was not the memory of those moments , but the memory after them of his unanswered telephone calls and the slow , agonizing realization that he was not wanted . When he opened his eyes he saw Betsy gazing at him compassionately , but before he even had time to hate himself , or her , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We 've had enough probing for one evening . Let 's change the subject . " " I think we ought to be leaving , as a matter of fact . " Bunty shrugged a little drunkenly and followed them obedientlyout to the car . He allowed Betsy to scramble in first so that she sat in the middle , but as they were swinging away fromp108the parking lot he said , " Better drop Betsy off f-f-first . Englewood is closer than Ridgewood . " " I 'm in no hurry . I 've got all night . " " That 's not the impression you gave a few minutes ago , " Betsy said sharply . " I 'm sure your mother can use the extra gas . Just drop me off first , since it 's on the way . " If it was a defeat it was a small one , and one against which he could hardly protest without looking silly ; besides , he was buoyed by the thought of the proposal that he would make in a few minutes . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A quiet evening spent insulting one another . W-w-what could be nicer ? " " I hope it was pleasanter than your other birthdays , " Betsy said politely . " My dear , " he replied indulgently , " you have n-n-no idea how this sort of thing would have been done in my grandfather 's day  --  or even my f-f-father 's . By the t-t-time I was old enough to understand how important it was to have f-f-fun , though , dear old Dad had s-s-screwed up his courage and tossed himself out the window of the Equitable Building . I was nine then . We got a b-b-bill from the owner of the limousine he b-b-bounced off before he splattered all over Cedar Street . F-f-friend of the family , the man happened to be , too , but he was v-v-very annoyedat what F-father had done to his roof . " Joe felt Betsy shudder beside him . He continued to drive without speaking , and Bunty went on quickly , " What I was w-working up to was that there was a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember those Christmas dinners at G-grandfather Traynor 's , and when his s-s-seventieth birthday fell during Christmas week  --  well ! The g-g-great legal light had his picture in the Times , with some r-reminiscing about how his father had once r-run for vicepresident . " On Christmas Day aunts I 'd n-never seen or heard of beforep109were clawing at each other in the d-d-drawing room , lapping up sherry that had been 1-laying on end in the cellar for generations . All of the horrible grandchildren had to r-r-recite poems to Christmas or to Grandfather . All except me  --  I was 1-1-left off because of the stutter , so I s-s-sneaked off to the old man 's library . I spent some happy hours there , with the t-t-traffic droningby outside on Park Avenue , and the rest of the r-r-relatives gathered around Grandfather for the photographer , with the old man caressing the elegant b-b-beard that he fancied made him 1-look like Charles Evans Hughes . All this time I was g - g- going through his hand-bound set of Thackeray , looking for dirty words . The old bugger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I 've told Mother , it 's always been m-my theory that one of the aunts copped it when everything w-went smash , and took it back to Swarthmore , where she could m-m-memorize it in peace . " " I hope you 're not going to take us all the way through your adolescence , Bunty . " " Am I b-b-boring you , Joe ? M-maybe I 've been talking to cover up a v-v-vast , horrible emptiness . How could you know ? " " Listen . Before we get to Betsy 's I have an announcement . I want to invite you both on a double date . The three of us , plus a girl that I 've got in mind for you , Bunty . " It was good to see Bunty suddenly grow wary  --  so wary that he did not at once reply . But Betsy , although she was startled , was not at a loss for words . " A girl ! " she cried . " What kind of a girl , Joe ? Someone like Marcelle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ? " he asked , and glanced aside from the road in time to see Betsy bite her lip . " I 'll just say that she 's not what you 're used to , not at all . " Bunty said lightly , but not without a trace of sullenness , " You should know I d-d-do n't like any girls except Betsy . " " It 'll be a kind of experiment . You like experiments , do n't you , Betsy ? We could all meet at my house and drink my mother 's gin . We could even play cards , if you want . "  | " Let 's do it , Bunty ! " Betsy urged . " Be a sport . " " That 's the wuh-wuh-one thing I 'm sure I 'm not . Still  --  how can I say n-n-no to Joe 's mother 's gin ? " " I 'm sure we 'll have a good time . " Betsy spoke reassuringly , almost maternally , as if she completely understood Bunty 's uneasiness . " You turn left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know . " The car rolled to a stop under the ornamental street lamp that cast a weak pool of light halfway up the front lawn of the Felton house . He switched off the ignition , and suddenly everything was very quiet . In that moment of calm late-evening silence he could hear Bunty breathing through his open mouth and Betsy slipping her feet into her pumps . As he turned to her she picked up her purse from her lap and said , " Well , it really was fun , was n't it ? And happy birthday again , Bunty , whether it was your birthday or not . " But Bunty , leaning against the door , made no move to open it . " May I get out , please ? " He shook his head and stared at her owlishly . " N-n-not until you 've thanked Joe properly . I ca n't kiss him good night  --  you 'll have to d-d-do it for us. " " aunty , really ! " " I 'm not m-m-moving until you do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . " I 'll let you out this side , Betsy . " " No , wait . " She extended her arm to detain him . " If it 's more distasteful to you than it is to me . . . " " Do n't be silly . " She held out both hands until they touched his chest , resting as lightly as birds on his shirt front , and she delivered her face up to him like an Aztec virgin rising to the sacrificial altar . Her lids were dropped , either from shame or inclination , shutting the last light of the street lamp from her blue eyes , and her figure was poised lightly , almost floating as it inclined toward him asp111evanescently as a bird coming to rest for just an instant on the limb of a tree . He could feel only the merest pressure on his mouth , but an overwhelming fragrance seemed to be passing from her lips to his , and he was nearly choked with a pounding desire to clutch her in his arms . Then she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when Bunty opened the door and stepped aside for her she drifted out of the car and up the walk to her darkened house without another word  --  not even a good night flung over her shoulder , or a wave of the hand . Joe waited only long enough to watch her disappear into the darkness , and then drove off quietly . For a few blocks they rode in silence . Finally he said , " That was a lousy thing to do . " Bunty leaned back dreamily and dropped his cigarette butt out the window over his shoulder . " I had to r-r-recoup . " " I know exactly what you 're up to with Betsy . " Bunty roused himself . " I sh-sh-should think so . It 's no secret . I t-t-tried to tell you about her in the m-men 's room , but you would n't 1-let me . If I tell you now , will you p-p-promise you wo n't get mad and d-dump me here ? " " Go ahead . " " The b-basic fact is that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're trying to take away from her at poker . " " Correction . Which I am taking away . What 's m-m-more , she owes me money already . " " And you 're not ashamed . " " Why should I be ? She 's n-n-never had such fun or 1-1-learned so much so fast . And I 'm d-d-desperate for the dough , with Mother d-d-dropping everything but her pants at Monmouth . I 'm p-p-pressuring Betsy to get her allowance raised , m-maybe doubled . Her old man could t-t-triple it without even feeling it , but she 's hesitant to ask him . You understand why . She 's afraid it will g-g-give him a bigger psychological hold on her . A d-d-delicate situation . She w-w-wants to please both her fatherp112and me , but she also w-w-wants to shock us  --  and maybe you too . " " Wait a second . Before you go any further you must understand that I 'm going to have to tell her this . " Bunty laughed until the phlegm rose in his throat . He pulled himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll be doing me a f-f-favor . She does n't believe me when I t-t-tell her ; she thinks I put it on to conceal my r-r-reluctance to take money from her . The m-m-more you expose me , the m-m-more she 'll see me as reckless and abandoned . " " You 're a clever boy , " Joe said bitterly . " And she 's a clever g - g- girl . " " I believe that too . If you taught her poker correctly I 'm sure she 'd whip the ass off you . " " Very likely , but I ca n't t-t-take chances . Already I have to cheat when we p-p-play . The m-m-money 's no good to her or to her old m-m-man . She gets anything she w-wants w-w-without the allowance . It 's d-d-dirty blood money from the w-w-war , and the old Jew knows it . " He 's doing it deliberately , Joe said to himself ; he wants to see how far he can push me . Coldly he said , " I despise that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more than you 're doing or ever will . " " C-c-conniving for it is more like it , j-j-just like I am . " " There are rules . You 're breaking every rule . " " I m-m-make my own . So does he . Ask Betsy . She knowsn-n-nottoo much , but she knows . " " In any case , it 's got nothing to do with his being Jewish . " " Have it your w-way . " Bunty shrugged . " I only w-w-wanted to tell you that if you 're going to get to Betsy this summer you 'll have to d-do it through me . " " What are you trying to do  --  sell her to me for a price ? " " Your only chance is to p-p-play along with us . Anything else will annoy her or b-b-bore her , and she 'll shake you off . She 's got enough schoolgirl 1-1-loyalty to see that you p-p-passp113your p-precious course . But I think you w-w-want more than that , do n't you ? " Joe would not reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to ; he could afford to wait now until Bunty betrayed himself . But when he stopped the car in front of the broad stretch of lawn that lay before the dark , looming hotel like a black blanket , Bunty stretched , yawned ( for which he begged pardon ) , and said , " T-t-tell me , Joe . Have you g-g-got the idea that Betsy 'd be upset if you could p-p-prove to her that I 'm queer ? Is that why you c-came up with the **25;8359;TOOLONG ? Does it occur to you n-n-now that that would only make me m-m-more interesting to her ? " " The only thing that occurs to me now "  --  and of course it would be a lie ; you could n't tell the truth to Bunty  --  " is that I 'd like to be home sleeping , if you do n't mind . " " S-s-sorry . Thanks for the 1-1-lift . M-maybe I can help you celebrate a birthday someday . " The gears clashed as Joe pulled away from the curb and roared off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be free , and the last thing he saw through the rear-vision mirror before everything grew dark again was Bunty standing narrowleggedat the curb and laughing , waving with stiff , formal , effeminatelittle semicircular gestures , like a royal princess acknowledging the applause of her subjects .

She held the gown in front of her , trying to conceal her polo shirt with one hand and her blue jeans with the other . Still it was hard to get an idea of the hemline with the blue-jean cuffs and the moccasinssticking out underneath . She had just kicked off the moccasins when the doorbell rang again.  | " Go away , " she said lazily , but she placed the gown carefully on the bed and ran down the stairs in her bare feet . At the second step from the bottom she could see the top of a mailman'shat through the glass panel of the front door . " For God 's sake ! " she said . She opened the door and took from the man 's outstretched hand a bulky , tightly sealed manila envelope , a pad , and a pencil stub . " Hot . " He wiped the sweat from his upper lip . " Real hot today . Registered special delivery . Sign by the X. " As she scrawled her name ( " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? " ) with the stub on the smudged pad she could hear the motor of the ancient mail truck throbbing at the curb , vibrating almost in time with the waves of heat . Inside the house she stared at the envelope ( addressed : HERMAN FELTON-but from where you could hardly tell , it had so many cancelation marks and post-office stamps on it ) and hefted it in her hand . Papers , documents , legal-feeling . She shrugged and was about to put in on the hall table next to the umbrella stand when the phone rang just under her hand . She picked it up and tucked it on her collarbone like a switchboardoperator , squeezing it between her jaw and shoulder so that her hands were free , one holding the impressive envelope , the other groping for a pencil . " Hello . " " Betsy , this is Daddy . " " Daddy ! Where are you calling from ? " " I 'm in New York . Listen , do n't ask any questions . Nobody is supposed to know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple days . Is your mother home ? " She made a face at the telephone . " She left about an hour ago . Thank God . " " I ca n't hear you . " " She took the bus to town . Shopping and movies . If she 'd known you were in the city she could have met  --  " " It 's just as good this way . Do n't tell her I called or where1p119I am . You 've got to do me a favor , Beppi . You 've got to stay home and wait for a parcel I 'm expecting . It 's very urgent . Do n't go away , not to school or anyplace . " " It came . " " What ? " Her father 's voice was high-pitched and exasperated . " The package . Special delivery , registered . It just this minute came . " She could hear the exhalation of relief , and for an instant she had a sharp vision of her father crammed into a boilinghotphone booth , his summer straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen , " he said a little more gently , but still with the same urgency . " I 've got to have it right away , and I ca n't leave here . You 'll have to jump into a cab and bring it here pronto . Do n't worry about the fare . I 'll take care of it when you get here . Never mind about school . But do n't let it out of your hands . Not for a minute . " " Supposing I ca n't get a cab ? " " See if you can get a ride from somebody . Do n't wait for a train . I 'm in a real hurry . I know I can count on you , honey . " He said this not in a wheedling tone , but with a faith that sounded genuine , even filtered thinly through the telephone . " Where are you ? " " At the Paris Nights Club on Forty-seventh Street . You know the place , it 's got a big sign in front . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right . ' By , Daddy . " She heard the sharp click of the receiver and at once she was leafing through the phone book , looking for taxis , but even as she looked she had a kind of foresight of what was going to happen . Cabs were n't allowed to come to the house , it was out of the question for the duration , there was no use arguing aboutp120emergencies , and after she 'd tried two cab companies she decided against wasting any more time and did what she 'd known she 'd have to do all along . The phone rang three times before she heard Joe saying , " Hello . " The sound of his voice , matter-of-fact and substantial , gave her the same kind of relief that her father must have felt when he heard about the parcel . Now it would be easy . Joe was having a sandwich with a college friend from Columbiahome on leave from the Army . He was planning on driving the friend to the city later on . " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Can you go in right away and take me with you ? I 've got to get to New York at once . There 's something that has to be in my father 's hands in an hour . We can drive straight back to school , to lab . " Joe said something about that being an inducement , and he laughed in a pleasant , carefree way , not sounding as though he was the master of the situation , but just as though he was glad she 'd thought of him . " Wait a minute , I 'll confer with Murray . " Then he was off  --  she could n't persuade him if he was n't listening  --  and somewhere in his house she could hear a radio playing . When he came back she knew it was all set as soon as she heard his voice . " We 'll pick you up right away , Betsy . " " I 'll be waiting out front . " She hoped she sounded grateful . " And Joe  --  do n't say anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's really confidential . " " If I do n't know myself there 's nothing I can tell him . " " You 're a peach . " She had to hang the gown away , the loveliest , most mature dress she 'd ever had , and get her face fixed up , and change from the jeans into a cotton dress and sandals . She took a tremendous white knitting bag from her mother 's bureau drawer , big enough for the envelope to fit in without being visible at all , and she was just locking the front door as Joe drove up . The ride was miserable . Joe 's friend was a big , plump corporal named Murray Goldstone , who sat on the outside and talkedp121across Betsy to Joe all the way in , reminiscing about people at Columbia that she 'd never heard of and laughing in a gruesome way about the terrors of basic training . She wanted to feel sorry for him because he was going to be shipped out soon  --  to the Pacific , he guessed  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't pay much attention to her aside from being polite , which was n't particularly flattering . Worst of all was the way he seemed to have attached himself to them , or at least to Joe , for the afternoon . Betsy could feel her hands sweating , worrying about her father , wishing there was some way to get loose from him without being rude and antagonizing Joe . Joe did it himself . She could have hugged him . His friend said , " I 've got to meet somebody in front of the Astor at four . Might as well kill the time till then with you . " And Joe said very casually , " You 'd only be bored , Murray . Betsy has to run this errand , and then we wo n't be able to stay with you anyway , because we 've got to turn right around and get back to school . I really think it would be better if we dropped you off first . " She could n't even bring herself to care whether Murray was hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him around her neck , and he was very courteous when they let him off on Forty-second Street for a foreign movie . He and Joe pumped hands , he gave Betsy a big smile , and then he was gone for good . " You do n't have to look for a parking place , " she told Joe . " My father is n't far from here . I 'll just hop out and meet you wherever you say in about ten or fifteen minutes . " " Nonsense . I just ditched my best friend for you . Tell me where your father is , and we 'll get going . " So she had to , and it was just as bad , maybe worse , than if he had n't got rid of his friend , because now she was more indebted to him , and he was going to invite himself right into the Paris Nights , whereas otherwise he might have waited outside with Murray . So I outsmarted myself , she thought bitterly as they turned back uptown to the night club ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she cursed herself she knew some/how that this was what she had wanted  --  although who could know why ?  --  that she had figured from the start that Joe would go in with her and confront her father in a situation that he wanted kept private , that she would impress Joe or embarrass her father or  --  or what ? Joe parked directly in front of the building , and she did make one last effort to keep him out , but he simply stepped from the car , directly in front of the No Parking sign , and took her by the arm , and they went in together . The place was freezing inside . Gloomy and mysterious , with the air-conditioning blowing in a crazy fury , it was such a violent change from the hot , sticky , littered street that she shuddered involuntarily . There was no one in the lobby , not a soul , and they could pad right in on the thick maroon carpeting , past the empty hat-check booth with its files of vacant crypts like a deserted mausoleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinted photographs of ventriloquists and their dummies in tuxedos , crooners with teeth showing and arms outflung , and statuesque girls , their swelling , half-bare breasts draped in furs . As they mounted the wide , shallow stairs to the dance floor and the stage , it was impossible to tell whether it was morning or evening , bathed as everything was in a permanent fluorescent half-light that concealed nothing of the Byzantine elegance but did n't really reveal one object of ordinary remembered reality . You could be buried alive in this huge plush morgue , and no one would ever find you ; it seemed impossible that at night hundreds of moneyed voices would mingle in the brocaded draperies , false promises would be made beneath the brassy music , stomachs would shake with laughter at vicious jokes , men and women would prepare to make love . What is my father doing here ? Betsy wondered . Is this his life ? And as they gained the main floor itself , panting like conspiratorsand clambering over the funereal loop of velvet rope that barred their way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I vant the exit to the right , to the right ! Vunce again , if you please ! " The voice was high , but hollow and reverberating , as if its owner were crying in a vault , crying in agony but without tears . The woman , they saw as they stepped onto the waxed ballroom floor , was a little withered creature in black slacks and blouse , weighted down with jangling jewelry , and hopping about before a low stage in a fantastic imitation of the long-legged girls in shorts and bathing suits who stood quietly above her , passively waiting for her frenzy to spend itself . The girls were beautiful , beautiful ghosts with real flesh that seemed to bulge in rich , embarrassing profusion from their brief panties and halters , and yet they were no more real than anything else , not even when they resumed their formal posture at the request of the dancing mistress , who seated herself at an enormous concert grand and began to pound out Aupres de ma Blonde . Betsy looked about warily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman or someone else would come along and order her to leave . Here , alone with Joe in the hollow noise of stamping feet , cleated toes and heels thwacking the hard floor , in the forest of upturned chairs growing from the tops of tables with their legs sticking in the air like dead branches , she stood and looked for her father , and at last she saw him . There was one table in a corner of the great room , half hidden behind a pillar that looked as though it were real veined marble and had real vines clinging to it , that was not stacked with chairs and was still covered with a white cloth , on which stood bottles , glasses , and a pile of papers . Seated round it was a group of men , all smoking , all arguing quietly beneath the pounding of the piano and the girls ' feet , all in shirt sleeves ( despite the cold ) save one . The man whose broad white back was turned to them had a shock of white hair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and would have preferred being bald . Scharf ? Was that Reuben Scharf ? Across from him was a man in white shirt and black tie , with a heavy Irish face ; his jacket was slung casuallyover the back of his chair so that the sleeves , circled round with gold braid , dragged on the dance floor like rag dolls . Next to him was a little creature with a face like a parrot , familiar , whom Betsy felt she would recognize if only she could hear his voice saying , " Polly want a cracker ! " And the only man who wore his jacket , cool and correct in his tropical worsted , was her father . Cigar poised between thumb and forefinger like a scalpel , he dominated the squabbling group like a surgeon lording it over a bickering party of medical inferiors at the operating table . " Daddy ! Here I am ! " she wanted to call out in a sudden rush of relief , but Joe was at her elbow and they were slowly moving across the dance floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she realized  --  so that we 're a part of it too , moving toward the stage for the big production number : the dancerswill part like flower petals , Joe will hoist me high in the air above their heads , my clothes will fall from me , I will take the parcel from the knitting bag and wave it in the freezing air while the countess murders the piano below me , and Daddy 's friends will gape and finally burst into cheers . Until someone nudged her father , and he turned sharply and then scraped back his chair and came to them , not seeming to hurry but moving swiftly . She opened the bag and brought out the envelope , watching with wonder how her father 's eyes seemed to change color in the dim , wild light , although he took it from her as casually as though he were accepting a cigarette . So she said loudly , fighting to keep herself from whispering , " Daddy , you remember Joe Burley . He was kind enough to bring me all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nice of you to bring Betsy . " But he had to go on , he had to say , " I hope you understand that this is a very confidential matter . " And what could he do after that but accept a complacent nod from Joe ?  | " Daddy , " she said , " about Morrow . I have to  --  " He waved his scalpel-cigar at her almost impatiently . " Stop worrying . It 's over . Forget what I wrote , tear it up . " " Really ? Is it all right ? That 's wonderful ! " " You 'll hear from him soon . I 'll try to get home this evening . Remind me , I 'll give you his new APO number . " " Oh . " She hesitated for an instant , trembling like an iron filing between the two poles , her father and Joe . " I wo n't be home this evening . I did n't know you were here . I thought you were in Washington "  --  goddam it , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm going out on a double date with Joe and anothercouple . " Her father 's face darkened . She watched his pupils dilate and she thought frantically : If he objects , if he puts his foot down , Joe will only laugh , he 'll laugh and say that 's all right , forget it , and then what will I do ? But her father merely put the envelope behind his back and said coldly , " Try not to come home too late . You got an early class tomorrow . Excuse me , I ca n't introduceyou to the gentlemen . I 'm proud of you , but "  --  his voice was as frosty as the air , and his words seemed to fall between them like freezing raindrops  --  " this happens to be a very private conference . " She stood there stupidly , dismissed but not knowing how to go , only faintly hearing Joe . " Come along , Betsy . Let 's hope I did n't get a ticket . We 'll have to hurry to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bear down on the table , a triumph , a cockiness , in his shoulders and his walk , so that she knew he was only waiting for her departure to tear open the envelope and shatter them with the magic proof of his dominion . At the table the men were drinking , waiting for her father , gulping and belching and making summer noises in this cold , dark chamber . Amazed , she observed that they were drinking soda pop  --  Seven-Up and Dr. Brown 's Celery Tonic  --  and it seemed to her that all they needed were colored straws to sip from and paper hats on their tousled heads to be children on anp126outing instead of secret planners , men who should be drinking bourbon , clutching the bottles in their heavy fists . In a dream , she allowed Joe to lead her away , feeling that she could never have done it alone and hating herself for her bewilderment and weakness . She gasped as they pushed open the heavy glass door and came out on the blazing , breathless sidewalk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll cool off when we get going . " But even with the warm breeze coming in through the windowsshe felt weak and enervated . I should be grateful for his silence , she thought listlessly , I ought to relieve him with some friendly chatter  --  but the effort was too great , and the things she really wanted to say were too dangerously close to a different kind of reality . It was too good to last , though ; Joe was itching , and he wanted to scratch the itch . He swung up from the West Side Highway onto the approach to the George Washington Bridge , and as they rose above the confines of the city into the suddenly fresher air he said , " Did you know any of those people ? " " No , " she said quickly . " Not any of them  --  except my father . " " That was Congressman Hennessy , the little one  --  with the screwed-up face  --  did you notice ? " Betsy laughed , a high , false giggle . " The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him once . He used to represent prostitutes and bookies before he broke into politics . The big fellow  --  did you see his jacket ? A captain in the regular Navy . " Betsy waited for him to go on , but apparently something was necessary first , so she said , " Really ? " " That was quite a crowd . " Joe smiled cruelly . " Yes , sir . I just wonder what your father 's up to . Business , do you think ? The war effort ? " " Why not ? " she asked angrily  | " Funny place for it , I 'd say . " " You 'd say , you 'd say ! What do you know about it ? Have you ever tried to build new industries , get people the things they need ? " " What 's he getting the captain ? Tickets to a Broadway show , or a new roof for his house in Newport News ? Or maybe a little help from the congressman ? The man sitting next to Hennessy was Breo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He owns the club . They say he 's good at getting sugar , steaks , things like that . " " That 's how narrowly your mind works , is n't it ! You do n't find it conceivable that my father could be doing really big things , do you ? " " I do n't doubt that . I just wonder what those big things are , tucked behind a pillar in a night club in the middle of the afternoon . " " Now I suppose you 'll feel free to violate our confidence . " Joe glanced at her in surprise . " I wo n't say anything to anybody . I just thought I could discuss it with you . Ca n't I ? " " If you only knew . " The tension was building up inside her like a twisting rubber band ; it felt as though any minute it would snap , twang , and something would explode in her throat . Then it started to come out , unwinding inside her , the words she had never said to anyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her utter even while she went on . " Everything he does , he does for us . If it was n't for his family do you think he 'd associate with those people ? He 's superior to them . I know it , he knows it . There are things you have to do if you want to  --  " " What ? " " If you want to make a place in the world . He 's throwing a party in Washington for somebody in the Navy  --  maybe that officer that was sitting there today . I know it 's going to help him in his contract negotiations , but he 's doing it for me too . " " I 'm sorry , I ca n't  --  " " I 've been invited . I 'll be meeting senators , diplomats , admir/als . So now do you see ? Do you see why he 's going to spend thousands of dollars flying their families in to Washington ? " " And you like that . " " My heart does n't palpitate just because somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Congress . But do n't I have as much natural right to be there as anyone ? Do n't I have the brains and the looks to belong by right , any place I feel like being ? Should I say no , I wo n't , just because I 'm fitted for something better than their society , or because my father is paying for the show ? " " I did n't say that . I just wonder how you feel about it . " " Do I have to make a drawing for you ? I want to experience everything before I die . Maybe it 's enough for you to read about it . Not me . I could make it on my own ; there 's going to be a day when I wo n't have to stand on anyone 's shoulders  --  " " Bravo ! " " But would n't I be a fool to turn down short cuts ? For what ? For ideals , like my brother ? " " And your father ? How do you feel about your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things possible ? " " Can you spend your life being grateful ? I 'm grateful to you for driving me in , I 'm grateful to your friend for not hanging on our necks , I 'm grateful to my father for not making a scene because I brought you in to the private meeting . And that 's just one afternoon . What you want me to say is that I love my daddy no matter what he does , because he 's doing it for me . " " I 'm simply curious . When you 're grateful to someone you do n't respect , it only makes you feel guilty . At least , " he added amiably , " it does me . " " All right , so I feel guilty too  --  but not for that reason . I respect my father . He 's got nerve . And he takes on one burden after another . What do you know about it ? You do n't know that my brother 's been in terrible trouble , and that my father 's kept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad heart . I only found out a little while ago because he confided in me . Forp129all I know , that meeting this afternoon was n't just business but something to help Morrow in his court martial . " " What 's his trouble ? " " He took  --  " Oh God , Betsy thought frantically , please do n't let me cry now . " He was using funds that did n't belong to him . " " But it 's all right now , is n't it ? Your father said  --  " " Maybe he was just saying it . If it is fixed up , if he did it and not Morrow , Morrow 'll never forgive him . " " Why ? " " There may be some things about Morrow I do n't understand , but I know more than he thinks . He hates being grateful . That 's what my father could never understand . He ca n't understand why Morrow should take money , but I do . He does n't respect money the way my father does , he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too if he wants to . That 's why he went into business before he joined the Army ; not because he liked it  --  he despised it , the way he does the Army  --  but to prove that he could do big things too . " Now Joe was silent ; at last she had shut him up , but at what a price ! Route 4 wound ahead as empty and pointless as a road in a nightmare , and they were rolling along on their way back  --  not forward , but back to what ? To nothing , to a stupid laboratory and another wasted afternoon . Betsy leaned back , exhausted , and stared up through the windshield at the blue afternoon sky laced with a thread of cloud that faded as she watched it into the palest vapor trail . At last she said , " I suppose you wonder why I do n't like my brother . " " Do n't you ? " " You know that , " she answered impatiently . " I think it 's because at bottom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can see it in his eyes when he sits there quietly listening to Daddy . He does n't care about what Daddy wants , he just laughs inside . And whatever he thinks about Daddy he thinks about me too . He tried to argue withp130me once or twice  --  he thinks it 's wrong to want things , to want them so bad you 'll fight to get them . He got no place with me , and I think he wrote me off . I do n't hate him for it ; it 's a different kind of nature . He looks quiet , but he 's wild and reckless , and he 'll take money or do anything on the spur of the moment . But how can I like . him if he does n't even make an effort to understand Daddy  --  or me ? " " I hope you think I do . " Joe looked at her gravely . " I do n't know whether to take you seriously . " " I 'll tell you why . You 've got plans  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an attic and designing a **28;8386;TOOLONG that nobody 'll ever build , but just the same they 're plans , and I do n't fit in . You can sense that I 'm just passing through . It 's different with Bunty ; he at least stands for the past . The hell with the present or the future , if there is any . The life the Traynors had is glamorous to you , and the more I try to prove it was dirty and ugly , the more glamorousit seems to you . " Then she started to cry . Like a child wetting the bed , she thought as she slid away from Joe into a corner of the seat and pressed her hands to her face , it 's shameful but it feels so good ; and she let herself go limp , wretched and wonderful as the selfpitywelled up so that it could not be contained and oozed past her eyelids . " What is it , Betsy ? Should I stop ? " She shook her head violently . No one could know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pride or ignorance or naivete , or maybe just bravado , into saying things that should have been left forever unsaid and into thinking things that she would never be able to say  --  certainly not to Joe , kind and soft and dumb and impossible , and yet stiff-backed like Morrow , sitting there and breathing disapproval ( not of her tears ; they were probably the first thing about her that he really liked without reservation or qualm ) of everything she desired and admired . " Is it because of what I said ? "  | " No . Please do n't stop ; we 'll be late for school . " She groped for a handkerchief and blew her nose . " I 'm a very selfish person . Maybe that 's why I started to cry , realizing that I 'm only concerned with our date tonight and the party in Washingtonand daydreams about becoming a mathematician . The things that should matter  --  my brother rotting away in Africa , in God only knows what kind of trouble , my father beating his brains out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly even think about . I just parade them to display my importance . But I 'm not a weeper , Joe , believe me , I have n't cried in years . " " I 'm very fond of you . You know that , do n't you ? " Betsy nodded , then turned to face Joe and smiled at him . Smiling radiantly , she thought  --  that 's the kind of a faker I am . Everything has to have the movie tag , everything has to be a production , a smile has to be radiant , tears have to flow like wine , and no one really knows how insincere I am . . . . The lab session was relaxing . Boredom can be pleasant , she thought as she watched the flies buzzing at the dusty window above Joe 's bent head . It was good to feel superior , to know that Joe was utterly dependent on her , not just for this simple problem which was so bewildering to him , not even for the entirecourse , but maybe for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected coldly , observing how humbly grateful he was for her presence , her quick hands , her lively mind , her encouragement that she never allowed to become arrogant or bossy  --  if I let him he 'll fall in love with me ; but I wo n't let him , and maybe that 's the most honest thing about me , that I will persist in being sharp and spiny and not the way he thinks I really am or ought to be . With Clapp it was different and simple . As he drifted by , the wings of his torn and stained lab coat flapping behind his long legs , the class book dangling from his bony fingers , and his sad eagle 's face perched on top of the scrawny neck with its gulping Adam 's apple , all she had to do was flash him a smilep132and give him a glimpse of the successful experiment to know that he was utterly hers . I can get him to give Joe any grade I want , she thought cheerfully , and with this knowledge the afternoonfloated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Joe to invite her to dinner . " It 's a terrible thing , " he said as they emerged from the cool gloom of the lab out into the still harsh sunshine of the campus lawn , " to ask you to spend the whole day with me , I know , but we can have dinner at my mother 's restaurant  --  I have to leave her the car anyway  --  and then we can walk over to my house and wait for Bunty . He 'll show up early enough ; he knows there 's gin there . " " What about the girl ? " " Peg ? " Joe laughed a strange laugh . " She 'll come running . I gave Bunty her phone number the other day , did n't be tell you ? I assume you 've been seeing him all along , ever since the time we met at Donaldson 's , to play poker or whatever kind of conspiringyou do together . " Betsy felt herself flushing . " He did n't tell me . " " Shame , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyway , " she said , " I 'll have to go home  --  after supper if not now . I 'll have to change my clothes . " " Nonsense . You look fine . You would n't go and get yourself all fancied up for old Bunty and me , would you ? " They stopped at the car . Betsy put her hand on Joe 's arm . " But the other girl  --  Look , I 've just got sandals on . " Joe laughed that strange , curt laugh again . The freckles seemed to be standing out on the bridge of his nose like birthmarks . Bunty had warned her ; he had said repeatedly in the last few days that Joe was up to something , that the double date was n't a generous gesture but a trick of some kind , a vengeful way of getting even and adding a fourth wheel because he was sick of being a third wheel , and now she was convinced that Bunty had been right . But Joe said coolly , " Believe me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , you ca n't go home after what you told your father . This time he might really get annoyed . I would n't be able to pick you up , either , because my mother wo n't be coming back with the car until pretty late tonight . " " Oh , that does n't make any difference . " " Not much ! Bunty would n't let me get away with not driving him over to my house if he could think of any way for me to get the car . " This was so close to the substance , even to the exact language , of what Bunty had said to her only yesterday that she could not keep from laughing . " All right . " Joe 's mother 's restaurant was lively , lively and noisy . The college crowd was there , whooping and milling around from one booth to another , but the food was dull and tasteless . What his mother had done , it was plain , was to provide a hangout with a suitable atmosphere for the mindless boobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Burley herself was far from dull and tasteless . She came over and sat with them in the back while they picked at their salads . She was a blunt-featured , husky little woman who looked like a stronger version of Joe and had a manner of talking around a cigarette , mouthing it toughly while she spoke , like a gangster 's moll . Joe said to her , " I had to park the car up the block , on the other side of the street . Here are the keys . " He tossed them to her . " Do n't come home too late tonight , Blanche . You know how I worry . " Was he imitating her father ? Betsy 's blood began to pound , but Mrs. Burley only laughed . " You wo n't impress your girl friend by being fresh . The least you might do is introduce us , unless you 're ashamed . " " This is Betsy Felton . She 's helping me to pass physics  --  I told you about her , did n't I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's who you were . Did your father tell you that he knew me in Florida many years ago ? " " He mentioned something . " Joe looked at his mother queerly . " These little things  --  they 're supposed to bring people closer together , but sometimes we 're better off if we start from scratch without the family connections , do n't you think , Blanche ? " His mother said nothing . Joe makes a fuss over the dim past , Betsy thought . All this must have been before I was born . She said , " I think my parents just had my brother Morrow in those days . " " Probably . I never met the rest of the family , just your father . " You did n't miss anything , Betsy wanted to say , but instead she volunteered , " I guess that was when my father was a liaison man between the legal distilleries and the pharmaceutical houses  --  kind of a salesman ; at least he used to travel a lot , the way he does now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a moment 's strained silence . Someone at the front of the restaurant was shouting , " Cut it out ! Cut it out ! " and then Mrs. Burley said smoothly , " I knew your father for a very clever fellow , even in those long-ago days . I see his name in the paper from time to time . He must be doing very well . " " He 's terribly busy . The war and all the expansion  --  he 's mostly in procurement , besides his own factories , and it 's very exhausting . " " I know . " Joe 's mother nodded sympathetically . " You give him my regards , dear . " " I 'll be glad to . " " Did I tell you , Blanche ? " Joe said . " We 're going to have a little party at the house tonight , as long as you 're going to be in New York and wo n't be around to bother us . " " Do n't mind the appearance of the place , Betsy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the house . But make sure that he does n't break my Swedish crystal , will you ? Particularly the stemware , it 's about the only thing in the house I 'm really proud of . " " How about me ? " Joe asked . You ! " She snorted . " There 's probably no gas in my tank , is there , and now I 'll have to go chisel some more ? " " I did have to take Murray Goldstone to New York . It was for the service , you know , the best cause of all . " " I do n't want to hear about it . Nice meeting you , Betsy . I 've got to be on my way . Stop by when you get the chance . " She nodded at Betsy 's picked-over salad plate . " Maybe next time the food will be better . " Betsy blushed . " Have a nice evening . " " You too  --  whatever it is Joe has in store for you ! " With a hoarse laugh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a difference , Betsy thought , between her and my mother ! The first time Mrs. Burley had said her name  --  was it " Make sure he does n't break my Swedish crystal , Betsy ? "  --  she had immediately taken Betsy into the arena of her life . The quick , casual intimacy was so pleasant that it opened a sudden vista of how good life could be with a mother who had a life of her own and admitted you to it on equal terms , not just as a daughter or a dependent or an object to be fretted over . How lucky Joe was not to be oppressed by the smothering blanket of Jewish family affection ! She was astonished at what he said next . " Well , that 's my ma . A real cold bitch , is n't she ? " " You 're crazy . I think she 's wonderful . " " Come off it . She 's just a tough Scotswoman without a wonderfulthought in her head . It 's enough that we tolerate each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know that , so how can you ? Her feelings are buried beneath a million layers of Presbyterianism and business man/agement . I think she 's disappointed in me . Why should n't she be ? Now take my friend Murray . When his mother squeezes you to that big hot bosom of hers , sister , you 've been squeezed ! " " You think that 's good ? " " What could be better ? " Joe laughed as he led her from the restaurant . " What else could you want from a mother ? Insults , like I get ? Murray 's old lady stands on her swollen feet from morning till night , boiling over with sweat and high blood pressure , baking Jewish goodies to stuff his soldier 's gut with . Catch Blanche lifting a finger when I get called to the colors ! " " Do you have any idea how neurotic it is , the attachment of Jewish mothers to their children ? Do you know what my mother cried about when Morrow went off to the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wear his rubbers , even though it was drizzling that day . That was all she knew , all she could cry about . " Joe stopped on the sidewalk and took her arm . " Betsy , I did n't know your mother was Jewish . You gave me the impres-sion  --  " She shook off his hand in a frenzy ; it was like being caught cheating in school . " What 's the difference ? Is n't that what you say ? What 's the difference ? My mother is partly Jewish ; her family is all mixed up . " " You hand me this talk about Jewish neurotic attachment from some book you picked up , but what else besides love do you expect from parents  --  companionship ? " " Why not ? " she asked fiercely . " Next comes the speaker 's address at the Father and Son Banquet . " He sneered . " Dad , be a pal to your son . My old man died when I was in fourth grade . All he could do with his spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with me  --  put me on his lap while he sat up nights trying to figure out how to beat the bank out of the mortgage pay-ments ? " " My father is as close to me as he is to anybody . He writesp137long letters , he tries to show me how to lead a decent life , he gives me advice  --  " " And you do n't know whether to laugh or cry , do you ? He hands down edicts from the top of that big high mountain , but you know it 's a volcano he 's sitting on , and what the hell right has he got to tell you how to live when he does n't know him-self ? " " You have no right , absolutely no right  --  " Betsy dug her nails into her palm and said more quietly , " Let 's drop the whole thing . " He ushered her across the street , against the light , to a block of two-family houses and smaller cottages , from which the early evening noises came floating out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lard , children circling slowly on their orangecratescooters , slowly using up the final moments of color in the twilight sky , a hose being played against a car in a driveway , a woman vainly calling her husband to dinner . " You 're not going to get off that easy , Betsy , " Joe said tensely . " You and Bunty are going to have to pay me back with something more than the usual boy-and-girl shit . You started this . Do n't insult me with gab about Jewish this and neurotic that . Your old man wants to sleep with you  --  why the hell should n't he ?  --  that 's the big truth about you , but he ca n't admitit , not even to himself , so he has to dress it up with all kinds of moralistic nonsense about leading you on the path of virtue . " " And my mother "  --  Betsy felt the blood throbbing in her throat like venom , and she wanted to shout , You bastard ! You bastard ! But at whom ? she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's jealous of me . " " For Christ 's sake , what else ? She ca n't compete , all she can do is lay on the couch and eat bonbons , just the way all my mother can do is run a business like a man . " " You 're not really interested in method , " Betsy said stiffly , " or in reasoning , or in anything except your silly ideas . But when I see a theorem I want to see the proof . "  | " Proof ! " Joe cried . " Proof ! What kind of trick of the mind is that , to evade life by thinking you can explain it with the tricks you and Clapp do so well ? You want proof about Blanche Burley ? " He held out his arm , forefinger extended dramatically like a Roman senator . " Behold her house , where I am a reluctantand temporary boarder . " Joe bent over and groped in the green milkbox at the head of the brick steps . " Keys in the milkbox . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Betsy stepped in nervously , feeling like an intruder in a stranger'shouse , and Joe was breathing at her back like a man who would suddenly grab her and do nameless things . But he merely took her from room to room , enumerating objects in the manner of a paid lecturer , and she realized suddenly that he was as nervousas she  --  no , even more  --  having a girl alone in this house . His tension made her composed , and she watched him almost compassionately as he flung open a door and said , " My room . Green eyeshade hanging from a hook . Typewriter on which I compose occasional letters . Pipe rack with pipes which I detest but have to have because they look manly . Sagging bed with frayed Bates spread , which Mother will keep just as it is until I return safe and sound . " But she was a little uneasy when he marched her across the floral-carpeted hall . " Blanche 's room . Note the back issues of McCall 's stacked at her bedside . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serial stories ; that 's her intellectual food . Notice the stark , tasteless furniture . Looks like it was bought on a dark night by candlelight , does n't it ? Shall I show you her wardrobe ? The closet is in this corner , behind the hideous mirror . " " That 's enough . This is most unfair to your mother . I do n't want to see her clothes hanging in the closet , and I do n't think you ought to show them to me , or to anyone . " " We must n't be unfair to Mother , must we ? " He stepped to her side before the full-length mirror . " What a lovely couple we make . We 'd look even better if I were in my officer 's uni/form , which I 'm going to owe entirely to you . " He put his arm lightly around her waist and squeezed , just a little . " It 's a shame that the mirror is n't a camera , to capture us just like this . You 're such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't believe me when I tell them how lucky I was . " Betsy looked reflectively at their figures in the glass . She said calmly , " You 're not going to kiss me , are you ? " " In my mother 's bedroom ? " Joe laughed . " That would be shocking . How unlucky for you that you do n't look Jewish , that you look like the girls in the campus magazines . You 're grateful for it , that 's worst of all , how can you reconcile that with the stuff Daddy drums into you about racial heritage ? Look at you ! Nobody would ever dream the truth about you . But then , look at me . No one would ever dream that I 'm  --  " Betsy twisted free from his grasp and said in a cold , hard voice , " That you 're what ? " " A missionary , trying to save your soul . " " From whom ? " A veil suddenly dropped from Joe 's mocking eyes . " From Bunty . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gin . " She stood leaning against the refrigerator with her bare arms folded , feeling the motor thrumming behind her , watching Joe pulling out bottles , cracking ice , squeezing limes . She did not offer to help . When he was finished he handed her a Tom Collins . " Let 's go into the parlor and dance . " " I 'd rather not . " He flicked out the kitchen switch and peered at her in the twilight gloom . " Why not ? " " I do n't want you to touch me . " " Come into the parlor anyway . I have to turn on the lights or Bunty 'll think there 's nobody home . " As softly as she could Betsy said , " I do n't like the things you say . I do n't mean the dirty words  --  I do n't like them , but I 'm not a baby . I mean the personal things . " Joe smiled at her over his drink as he ushered her into the livingp140room . " Playing the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's talk like a college couple on a date . I 'm out of practice ; you start . What should we talk about ? Glenn Miller ? Mrs. Roosevelt ? Or serious stuff , the Nazis and the Russians ? Do you think the Russianswill be able to hold out ? " It was cheap , she thought ; no matter what she said now , he would twist it into something mocking . I could go , she thought ; if it were n't for Bunty I could walk out of here and drown myself in a double feature . She tossed her head . " You could tell me about this girl Peg . Is she a student at Benedict ? " " Not exactly . But you might say she knows all the boys  --  several generations of them . She used to be a waitress at ipy mother 's restaurant . I do n't know exactly what she does nowadays , probably works in a shipyard . It 's good money , and she wants to win the war as much as anybody  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betsy burst out angrily , " What a rotten trick ! " " Now why are you angry ? Snobbery ? Are you too proud to spend an evening with a woman like that ? Nobody can see you except Bunty and me , here in the privacy of my house . " " Why did you have to do it to Bunty ? What can he possibly have in common with her ? " " Sex . You 've heard of it , have n't you ? Peg has always been grateful as hell for a movie and a bag of popcorn . And for an evening at Blanche Burley 's house , she 'll give Bunty all he wants  --  if he wants any . " " You 're disgusting . " " I think Bunty is . Who is this person that you 're with almost every day in the week ? What do you know about him besides the drunken fairy tales he chooses to tell ? " The doorbell rang . Joe got up and glared down at her as she pressed her arms to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't know anything , " he said over his shoulder as he unlatched the door . " But you will tonight . "  |p141The  woman ( she was n't a girl , she was a woman ) came in first , followed by Bunty , who gave Betsy a wink that might have been a signal , an involuntary movement of despair , or a meaninglesstwitch , and last by Joe , who slammed the door behind him , his face twisted into a grin . Betsy rose automatically , dizzy and faint with the knowledge that now she was in a situation from which nothing and nobody could free her  --  no , not even Bunty , who was himself caught in the trap which he had drunkenlyforeseen in his own vague way but which he was powerless and maybe even unwilling to avoid . How crazy , she thought wildly ; after all our silly planning and scheming against him , Joe flips us over on our backs like helpless turtles with nothing more than a shove of his foot . And for what ? she wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one will ever know . " Betsy , I 'd like you to meet my 1-1-lady friend , Peg Bischoff . " Bunty winked again , right in the woman 's face . " Hi , honey . You go to Benedict too ? " Betsy moved her head up and down . The woman was thirty-five years old , maybe forty , with two spots of color high on her heavy cheeks , and two purple lips , much larger than life , painted over her own . A line of blackheads marched horizontally across her forehead like a small army of ants , and the roots of her hair beneath the yellow-white bleach were dark and sour-looking . Her body was old , shapeless , and uncorseted . She looked like somebody 's maid , dressed for a Thursday evening at the movies . " I bet I 've been going out with Benedict fellows since you was in public school . " She accepted the drink that Joe pressed into her hand and swallowed it eagerly . " I used to work for Joey 's mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gullet frozen . She took a sip from the glass Joe handed her and kept her eyes averted from Bunty , seated on the couch , the woman 's butt already parked beside him.  | " Nice place she has . Very high class . Those Benedict boys , they 're gentlemen , one and all . And I always showed them a good time , did n't I , Joey ? " " That 's what they say . They all say that about old Peg . " Joe turned on the phonograph and put on a record . " Come on , let 's dance . " " Oh no , not me ! " Peg laughed and nudged Bunty , who was down on his spine , his face buried in a glass of gin . " We 'll sit this out , wo n't we , honey ? " Bunty muttered something inaudible , and to her amazement Betsy heard herself saying , " Do n't you like to dance ? " " Used to love it , honey . Used to be able to dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that , Joey ? " " You told me once . Is that why you 're not working for Blanche any more ? " Peg 's face clouded over . " Partly . My arches collapsed . I told your mother , I said , I just ca n't sling hash when my feet feel like they 've got red-hot needles sticking up through them . ' We 're still friends , though . I seen her in the dime store last Saturday ; she told me you 're going in the Army soon . " " That 's right . What 're you doing now ? " " Working down at Kearny , in the shipyard , welding . It 's not bad , I can sit on a box almost all day . But I 'm sure glad to see you again . " She added irrelevantly , " This Bunty 's one sweet kid . " " We all think so , " Joe said . " Do n't we , Betsy ? Help yourselvesto another drink . " He turned back to Betsy and extended his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with him , through the living room , into the dining room and around the old fashionedround mahogany table with its centerpiece of wax flowers lying funereally in a cut-glass bowl , twice around the table , and then into the kitchen and back into the living room ( without looking at Peg and Bunty on the couch ) and on into the dark sun parlor facing the street.  | " See the curtains ? " Joe murmured . " That 's to keep the sun from coming into the sun parlor . Blanche keeps it furnished  --  daybed , card table , bookcase with old copies of Life magazine  --  but it 's too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter . " " Why did you do it , Joe ? " she whispered . " Why did you do it ? " But instead of answering  --  or was it that he did n't even hear , humming the music and holding her lightly ? or perhaps she had n't even actually uttered the words  --  he guided her easily back into the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look now , and as she stared ( it made no difference how much she stared ; neither of them could see her or wanted to ) she was reminded of a movie she had once seen with her brother on a Saturday afternoon , of a battle between a snake and an eagle . The snake had darted and hissed , but before the horrified eyes of all the children in the audience he had finally been clawed and smothered into submission by the great talons of the eagle  --  just as Bunty was now by Peg , who had folded his thin body round with remarkable agility and was sucking at his broken face with her huge purple mouth . " Here now , " Joe said . " Here now , not in this room . Go on into the sun room if you 're going to do that . Betsy and I would like some privacy . " The woman grinned as she dragged Bunty to his feet . " The kids want to be alone , honey . " Her voice was husky and her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ruminating cow as she wrapped her arm down around Bunty and petted his smeared cheek . Betsy glanced briefly at Bunty and was horrified to see him wink at her just as he had done earlier . It would have been better if he had been dragged from the room unconscious . The thin glass doors of the sun parlor shuddered closed , and she was left alone with Joe . He looked up at her from the phonograph , where he was adjusting another record . " Did you see him wink at you ? I wonder what that meant . "  | " Joe "  --  she had to speak quite loudly over the dance music  --  " I want to get out of here . I want to go home . " " No car . " He shrugged . " Besides , I ca n't leave those two alone . Suppose someone rings , or my mother comes back ? " " I do n't care . " " So you 're a coward after all . " " I 'm not . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He cut off the machine and turned to her . " Sit down on the couch . Go on , sit down . " Betsy did as she was told and was enveloped at once in the cloying odor of Peg Bischoff 's perfume . She attempted to move away , but instantly Joe was beside her , his hand gripping hers . " Do n't get up , " he said . " Do n't move . " " Now I suppose you 're going to try to make love to me . Is that the next item on your agenda ? " " Shut up and listen to what 's going on in there . Listen to the person you admire . " " You 're a fool . " I mean it , she thought , I mean it . " Are you trying to prove something I do n't even care about ? Why did n't you get him a bathing beauty , a young and bashful one , if you really wanted to show me , instead of that . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bunty and the ravenous woman . Was it their joined shadow that loomed for a second behind the curtains , monstrous , distorted , and grappling ? She blinked her eyes ; there was nothing but the curtains , and behind them a succession of awful groaning noises . " If you think he 's being attacked , Betsy , you can open the door and save him . He might be grateful  --  even proud . " " You 'd really like me to stoop that low , would n't you ? " " Who is stooping lowest  --  you or me or Bunty ? " She whispered , " He did it for me , he  --  " And then Joe , staring at her as if she were mad , stopped her mouth with his hand smelling of gin and tobacco and said , " That ? He did that for you ? "  |p145In  the silence that continued even after Joe removed his hand she could hear a somber , rhythmic sound , like a gong being beaten somewhere far away . " What  --  ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " That 's Peg and your sensitive aristocratic friend . " She started to cry then , with her face in her lap and her hands over her ears to shut out the dreadful sound ; but it was no use , even with her fingers jammed in her ears until they throbbed . It was over at last , but what came after was even worse because it was so unimaginable . If there had been tears , whimpers , she could have borne it , but this hacking laugh of triumph , so typicallyBunty 's , this flare of companionable cigarettes being lit in the dark behind the ninon curtains , were more than she could stand . She closed her eyes once again and rocked her head in her lap until she felt Joe 's hand on her back , drawing her toward him . She spoke into his shirt front . " I 've cried twice today . Are you satisfied ? " " No . " " You should be . And please do n't stroke me . I 'm not a kitten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to make you cry , but why is it so important that you should n't ? " " You do n't leave me much if I ca n't preserve my composure . " " At a time like this ? " " Why not ? What else can I take pride in  --  my family ? My background ? Or my shoe size ? I can only warn you , do n't mistakemy tears for defeat . I reserve certain rights to myself . " Betsy crossed her legs and looked at Joe coolly , trying to stop her ears to the bedroom noises still coming from the dark sun parlor . If only he knew , she thought , how everything is churninginside of me , how I wish to God I could run to the bathroom and vomit and then crawl home to bed . She said , " You 're still back in the nineteenth century , you 're trying to save me from ap146fate worse than death . So you put on a little play , with the help of that creature  --  " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine if I purge myself with tears , as long as I learn my lesson . " " Well ? Have you ? " She jerked her head at the sun parlor . " You thought you 'd prove that Bunty is perverted . You wanted to humiliate us both . He 's proved that you 're wrong , and you have n't even got the guts to admit it . " He held up his hand . " Listen . They 're at it again . " " You ca n't terrorize me any more , " she whispered . " It takes courage to do what he 's doing , more than you 'll ever have , because it comes from the kind of breeding you and I have n't got . His father broke out of society by killing himself . If Bunty mocks at him , it 's only because secretly he 's proud of his father . I know I 'd be . He 's not afraid himself to make a complete break . " " Is that what he 's doing now ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And why is he doing it ? " Joe asked angrily . " Why ? " " To prove that he can . Is n't that reason enough ? " Joe leaped to his feet . " It sickens me to hear you inventing this crap about breeding and bravery . He 's the same kind of tramp that she is . They would have gone at it right on the couch if I 'd let them . " I wo n't answer , Betsy thought . I wo n't say a word . I 'll just sit here , and soon it will be over . Her arms crossed over her bosom to contain the steady shivering , she watched Joe turn the knobs of the Atwater Kent radio until he had found music loud enough to drown out the other sounds . He stood blankly , not looking at her , staring at nothing . " Joe , " she said at last , " do me one favor . " " Glass of water ? " " Please . I do n't  --  want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , but that 's the nicest part , " he said savagely . " All blowsy and stinking , with their hair disarranged and their puffy eyes blinking and their sweaty clothes half open . You really should n't miss that . " " I 'm not a coward . I proved that . I sat through everything else . You ca n't gain anything more now . Please take me home . " " I should think you 'd want to give Bunty a big fat kiss for his courage . What good was his terrible sacrifice if you 're not here when he comes out ? Why  --  " He stopped suddenly . " What 's the matter ? " Two headlights , shining through the screened window , swung sharply across the room and disappeared as an automobile roared up the driveway . " It 's Blanche . She 's home early after all . Wants to join the party . " " I ca n't see her now . I ca n't . " But even as she spoke Joe was pounding at the glass-paned doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said loudly . " Hurry up , my mother 's here . " He turned back to her . " You can wait out front . I 'll go around to the garage and get the keys from Blanche and drive the car back out . She 'll come in through the kitchen . Get going . " " You 're not going to leave them here ? " " Have you got a better idea ? We ca n't wait . " Then he was gone , leaving a trail of laughter behind him , as cold and thin as vapor . As she stood in front of the house it was as if none of it had happened . The tired summer air smelled just as it had when they had walked up to the house ; and three thousand miles away , in North Africa , where it must smell of blowing sand , of heat , dust , and breathlessness , her brother was undergoing a trial a thousand times worse than her own . A cheap , dirty farce , she thought , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; my father worries about him ; and here I am , the happiest girl in the world , the beneficiary of it all . Shep148wanted to laugh , but something in her chest warned her that she was on the verge of hysteria . I 'm the one they 're fighting for , she thought crazily ; I 'm what the war is about . Joe backed the car swiftly out of the driveway and leaned over to open the door for her . " Let 's go . " " What 's your mother going to do ? " " I told her you had a sick headache . Is n't that what girls always have ? " " I 'm not one of those . Is n't she angry ? " " Not yet . But she 'll be furious . Peg Bischoff makes her sick to her stomach . The idea of Peg 's being in her house  --  " " And Bunty ? " " She wo n't blame him . " Joe stopped for a red light and smiled coldly at her . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn , after all the years that she kept Peg on in the restaurant , knowing that she was a nympho ? That was business , it brought in customers  --  even though it made her nothing but a madam . She was sorry for Peg , so she used to say . But having her in the house , laying on her daybed ! " " I do n't feel sorry for you . " " Who asked you to ? " He added reminiscently , " I did n't tell you , did I , that it was Peg who took my virginity , one afternoon long ago , right up against a bureau ? She was good about it , I 've always felt grateful to her . " " I 'm not in the least interested . " He was quiet then , all the way back to Englewood , driving slowly and expertly , and at least leaving her alone while she lay back against the cushion and stared up through the windshield at the starless night sky . There is a way , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , to recoup your losses , at least to cut your losses and make a fresh start , to get back into the driver 's seat . By the time they reached her house she had made up her mind . " Joe . " She murmured his name softly . " I 'll kiss you good night if you 'll tell me something . "  | " I 'm going to buy my way back , is that it ? I 'll tell you what . I 'll kiss you if you 'll tell me something . " She shrugged faintly and drooped toward him , feeling herself falling through the dark until his arms were around her and his face grew larger and larger and his eyes merged and became one great staring eye ; she lowered her lids and felt his breath warm on her cheek . He kissed her tenderly , almost in a brotherly way , and she returned the kiss gently , holding it through an endless moment until he himself drew back and stared at her , still holdingher fast in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded far away to her . " Was it ? Now you can ask your question . " " Why did you do it ? Was it to get even ? Just to torture me ? Are you really that cruel ? " " To bring him down in your eyes . I knew that whatever he did , he 'd expose himself . " " You 're so wrong . So wrong . " He kissed her then , harder this time , and so swiftly that she had no chance to turn her head . The pressure of his mouth was more real now , vibrating ( or am I vibrating ? she thought dizzily ) and pressing her lips apart , and his arms were straining at her , one hand groping until it found her breast and curled up tightly around it , against her beating heart . With his lips just touching hers , he muttered , " I feel your heart pounding under my hand . Tell me why you hate it . " " Hate . . . " She could not speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest . " Why did you pick the person who ca n't give you love ? Why does it disgust you when he does n't ? Because your parents are inside , in there , doing it now , enjoying each other in the only thing they have in common ? " She broke free at last , with a twisting motion that wrenched her loose from his grasp . " This is why , " she gasped . " The maulingand the shoving , the gasping and the sweating . "  | " But not when Bunty does it . It 's different then ! " " He did n't want to , " she cried in agony , " you know that . It was an act of will ! " " Just as you kissed me with an act of will . " " Yes ! " Joe leaned away from her and said sadly , " You 're the luckiestgirl in the world . The world is your oyster ; do n't smash it to find the pearl . " " What should I do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars ? Marry some moron and have his babies ? " " There are better things . You do n't have to turn to Bupty ; you do n't have to deny your sex . " " How easy it is for you to talk ! " she said bitterly . " All you have to do is wipe the lipstick off with a Kleenex and drive away . But I 'll never let my sex spoil my life . It wo n't rule me , I 'll rule it . And I wo n't throw it away  --  " " On me ? " " On anyone . Good night . " He did n't answer , and she climbed out of the car awkwardly , tremblingly , feeling Joe 's eyes on her as she mounted the steps to the porch . In the front hall she slipped off her sandals and tiptoed up the stairs , avoiding the one that creaked , praying , Please , God , please , God , let them be asleep  --  until she had reached the sanctuary of her room . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sank wearily onto her pillow . Rolling first to one side , then to the other , she wriggled free of her brassiere and underpants and shoved them off the bed . Asprawl , naked on the coverlet , she fell asleep almost at once , her thumb going to her mouth as she sank from consciousness .

The hearty , inhuman voice of a radio announcer intoned , " Here is the eight-o'clock news . The official German radio DNB announced today that Field Marshal Rommel has issued an order of the day . . . " His mother , seated on the couch in her stocking feet , with her fingers in her mouth , muttered something indistinguishable  --  " . . . some music . " Joe arose , folding the book around his finger to mark the place , and turned the dial until he found a dance band . " The evenings are getting shorter , " he said over the music . He sat down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother . " The best of the summer is over . " Blanche nodded . She was reading Eleanor Roosevelt 's columnin the Ladies ' Home Journal , which was spread out in her broad lap ; while she read she picked her teeth vigorously with dental floss , working her fingers far into her mouth . No wonder her teeth were still so good . With a Turkish towel wrapped around her freshly washed gray hair , she sat , her stocky figure firmly planted under the fringed lamp , and read and picked . At last she was done . She rolled the dental floss between thumb and forefinger , dropped it into an ashtray , and said , " Going out tonight ? " " Yes . " " Should n't you be studying your astronomy ? " " The stars will stay in their courses . It all seems a little silly . But do n't worry , " he added hastily . " I 'll pass . " " Who you going out with ? Betsy ? "  |p156There  was no point in telling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened with Peg Bischoff . But Blanche threw him off with her next remark . " I saw Betsy this afternoon , coming up Bacon Street with that creature , the one with the stutter , that was here that night . " Joe noted with amusement and satisfaction that his mother refused to remember that Peg too had been in her house . " God knows what they were doing on Bacon Street . " Joe said coldly , " I do . She spends a lot of time with him . " " She ought to have her head examined . Are n't you her beau ? " He laughed . His mother had a habit of using outworn slang that was at once annoying and endearing : when he was still on the paper she had told him that she had a " trade last " for him , and he had n't found out until later what it meant . " No , I 'm not , " he said . " If anybody is , Traynor is . " " For God 's sake . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe had told him how he felt about Betsy . " You 're making a big thing out of nothing , " Murray had said over the telephone . " She 's nothing but a spoiled adolescent . " And that on the basis of having sat next to her for half an hour ! No wonder they had n't met again before Murray was shipped out , as they had expected to ; they had both sensed that there was nothing more to be said , and Joe had accepted Murray 's new mailing address with a sense of shame , knowing that at most he would send only a postcard when he himself went away to the Army . " It 's strange , " he said to his mother , " how people drift apart . Murray was my best friend at Columbia . But when he was home this time I felt that he 'd already gone off into another world  --  and he surely felt that way about me . We 're not interested in the same things any more . " " That 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people drifting in and out of your life . Except that at my age , when they drift out , it generally means that they die . "  | " And at my age ? " If Blanche was embarrassed she did n't show it . " War is abnormal . I 'm talking about the course of a lifetime . Remember your friend Eddie in junior high ? How we used to kid you ? You would n't go anyplace without him . Tennis every day after school ; then he 'd have supper with you here or at the restaurant or at his house , and evenings . . . " It was true , and he had n't even given Eddie a thought in years . If they were to meet now , what would they talk about ? It was laughable ; if Murray could n't understand about Betsy , which of his friends could ? The rank wind blew across the campus even more strongly than it did on the street , where the parents of boys like Eddie stared with ugly envy at anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free man , after their sons had been snatched from them and shipped away . A difference in age of six months or a year , negligible before , not even worth mentioning , had now become the key to an endless chain of rivalries and envies : it was a difference that could toss you into the whirlpool or give you the chance to cling for a few months longer to a life that by its very temporariness and inadequacy was no longer worth livingand made you sooner or later an object of scorn in your own eyes ( no matter how coldly you calculated your own chances ) , if not in other people 's . The faculty members were worst of all in a way ; desperately hanging on until they could reach the safety of thirty-eight and old age , or the fake importance of teaching soldiers , or the blessed security of piles , ulcers , or softly murmuring hearts . In such an atmosphere it was impossible to conceive of friendships being formed , plans being made , love affairs blossoming , even on summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community of fear was cynical hope , petty conniving , and the kind of warped and nameless relationship that had sprung up ( and would have to die soon ) among Betsy , Bunty , and himself.  |p158He  put the textbook aside with a sigh . " I might as well be going now . " Blanche glanced up , amused , over the rims of her bifocals . " You do n't sound very enthusiastic . " Instantly he was reminded of an incident that had occurred when he was twelve and he and Blanche were spending a month in Florida ( one of those joint Southern winters that had gone on until he was fifteen and lied his way out of further trips by hinting that his school work was suffering ) . He had met his mother one afternoon strolling along Lincoln Road in Miami Beach on her way back to the hotel , arm in arm with a beefy , vulgar man whom she introduced as Mr. Mollwitz , in the wholesalecigar business in Newark . That evening she had sent him off to see the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby he glanced into the bar and saw Mr. Mollwitz sitting expectantly at a table for two , chewing Sen Sen and sipping a whisky and soda . He returned late enough , having sat through the main feature twice , but as he walked along the corridor he heard their voices ringingout over the transom , and he had to turn the knob against the pressure of Mr. Mollwitz 's broad back . Mr. Mollwitz clapped his hat on his head , waved farewell to Blanche , asked Joe how he had enjoyed the movie , and slipped a new fifty-cent piece into his hand . " What was the matter with the picture ? " Blanche asked . " You do n't sound very enthusiastic . " He-ran on into the bathroom , threw the coin into the toilet bowl , and flushed it down . Now he yanked up his tie and threw his jacket over his arm , looking at her obliquely . " Maybe I 'm not . " " Oh , say ! I almost forgot ! I wanted to show you something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her the newspaper that lay over the heavy hassock like a tent , and watched incuriously as his mother dived through the pages . When she found what she wanted she emerged , foldingback the paper triumphantly . " Here , take a gander at this . "  |p159He  stared down at the society page , at a photograph captionedboldly : N. J. GIRL IN SOCIAL WHIRL . It was Betsy with her hair up , in an evening gown , a cake knife in her hand , cutting a three-tiered , sugared dive bomber and smiling at the camera , with her father and a hard-looking automotive executive , one of the heads of the war-mobilization program , standing at either side of her . " Very attractive , " he said . " That 's big-time stuff for a young girl . Parties in Washington , no less . " What was the sense in commenting ? He said , " See you later " over his shoulder and went out to the car . Parties in Washington  --  ifthings broke right for her and her father she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , a year at the outside . Near the bridge he picked up a uniformed hitch-hiker carrying a grubby duffel bag . The soldier , a T/5 stationed at Camp Shanks , was pathetically , whiningly envious of Joe 's car , his shortsleevedshirt , and his cord suit , and so eaten up with loneliness and homesickness for Sheboygan , Wisconsin , that Joe felt waves of guilt lapping at him like the heat that rose from the floorboards . He dropped the soldier at Times Square ( through the rearview mirror he could see the man standing at the curb , his duffel bag hanging from his index finger , not moving , staring at the flow of passing traffic , as if now that he had reached his goal he was wondering what he had come for ) and continued on downtown to the Village . He parked the car on Barrow Street and walked around the block to Chumley 's . Betsy and Bunty were sitting at a table across from the bar , before the wall lined with the dust jackets of forgotten novels under glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small group of kibitzers clustered around them . " Excuse me . " Joe shouldered his way through . " Pardon me . " Bunty looked up . " J-j-just in time to buy the next round , Joe . "  |p160Joe  sat down next to Betsy . " I saw your picture in the paper . " " Not very flattering , was it ? " " You need n't be modest . Blanche was very impressed . We both marveled at how quickly you 've gotten into the thick of it . Your father must be every bit as remarkable as you said . How dull it must be for you here in New York now ! But go ahead with the game . It 's your move , is n't it ? " In that instant he had a terrible premonition of disaster . Something in Betsy 's swimming eyes , in the tension of her fingers , warned him that she and Bunty had reached a new understandingsince he had last been with them ; he suspected that if he were to look under the table he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fought over the game . But Bunty merely remarked amiably , " We 're p-p-playing Betsy 's game for a change , but not for money  --  I 'm not good enough . Only f-f-fair , is n't it ? " In one way , Joe thought , watching Bunty brush back his black forelock as Betsy 's tanned arm flashed over the board , hesitating at a pawn , flicking at a bishop , finally tapping a rook , Bunty was very easy to get to know . He enjoyed talking about himself , and he was n't particularly interested in other people , except insofar as he could learn things about them that might be of advantage : how they were vulnerable in certain ways , or generous , or well fixed , or well connected . Of course he lied continuously , but when you had worked your way through the maze of repeated falsehoods in order to establish the simplest facts about his background and tastes , you saw that his true cleverness ( the part that Betsy could n't understand even after it was proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) lay in his recognition that constant lying was an asset : he seemed to know instinctively how to mix an assortment of truths and lies , like a pitcher with a good change of pace , so that you could never be quite sure whether he was telling the truth at any given point . Bunty 's tobacco-stained finger , slyly pushing a pawn up top161challenge Betsy 's rook , reminded Joe of the pinball machine in Shapiro 's drugstore across the street from the campus , where he had often met Bunty in the last few weeks , waiting for Betsy to come in . Standing in the summer heat , surrounded by the littlenoises of buzzing flies , the whirring milkshake machine , and the radio recounting the naval warfare raging in the Pacific , they concentrated on the lights that flashed and lit up the battleships painted on the upright glass back of the machine . When they had two piles of nickels on top of the machine , Bunty , bending his bony awkward frame over the plunger like a crane spearing a fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy metal ball , would stammer , " I 'm g-g-going to gyp you out of some of those n-n-nickels , Joey . " Then Joe would count the nickels that belonged to him , and he would be sure , when Betsy came hurrying in , that Bunty had only been kidding , trying to throw him off his game . But the next day , when the same thing happened again , he could n't be quite certain that Bunty really had n't stolen some of the nickels from his pile . In the poker sessions with Betsy , Bunty rarely had to cheat , despite what he had confessed to Joe , unless his adding new rules to the game at nearly every meeting could be called cheating . Whatever he did  --  and even after it was pointed out to her  --  Betsy was a loyal subject cheering her king 's chastity , and ' cheering just as proudly when it was proved that he was a rake . There was nothing to do but watch ; and at least in this game it was quite impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next best thing . By letting Betsy play her own game , which she did with concentration and skill , and letting her show off at it , he could concentrate himself on something he had never achieved before  --  getting Betsy drunk . The drinks were coming fast , and as Joe sat helplessly next to Betsy , knowing that if he as much as mentioned it she would turn on him in a fury and everything would be lost , and watching her cheeks redden so that you could almost measure the effect of the unaccustomed drinking on her , he sensed that it was all gatherp162ing to a climax and that after tonight they would never again stand in the same relationship to one another . You could see it in Bunty 's red-rimmed eyes , in the glint of approaching triumph that lighted them , in the nervous , excited way that he sniffed back the drops of moisture from the end of his nose . He did n't even display any impatience with the game , at which he was hopelessly inept , but went along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for Betsy herself to push away the chessboard and declare her weariness with the entertainment . And she did at last , of course , brushing her hand across her forehead when she had gained her checkmate . " Oh , that 's enough . I do n't want to play any more . Do you , Bunty ? " Bunty shook his head casually , flinging the forelock out of his eye . " Not if you do n't . But how about you , Joe ? " he asked , bending toward Joe with false solicitude . " Not tonight . " Now , if ever , was the chance to get them out , to destroy his own forebodings , if nothing else . " Let 's get out of here and go for a walk . We can wander around the Village . " " An excellent idea . " Betsy was on her feet at once . " We 'll be tourists ! Come , Benton , finish your drink and let 's be off . " Out on the sidewalk Betsy took them each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dragging them with her and laughing as she went . " I feel marvelous ! " " That 's the rum , " Joe said . " You 've had just enough . " As soon as he said it he wished he had n't . " Good old Joe Burley the measuring man . What do , you supposewould happen if I had just a little bit more than enough ? " Joe shrugged . Her arm was hooked through his , and he held her as tightly as he could , but on the other side she held Bunty equally fast . " Do you know what I want to do ? " she asked . Her voice rang out loudly on the empty street . " I want to go dancing . I want to dance my head off . " " Let 's go to George 's , " Bunty said lazily . " Who 's he , friend of yours , Bunty , pal ? "  |p163Bunty  laughed . " It 's a place . A hangout . Used to be the b-b-big hangout back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . " " Come , Joe , do n't hang back . Do n't you want to dance with me ? " " It 's too noisy there , " he said stubbornly , " too crowded . " " That 's just what we want . We want to be touristy , do n't we ? We used up Chumley 's , now let 's go use up George 's . " Bunty planned it this way all along , Joe thought hopelessly , and now I am tagging along like a petty accomplice , a walking wallet . There was only one weapon left  --  the car . And if that failed . . . " You know something , Joe ? " Betsy peered up elfishly into his face . " aunty and I have big plans tonight , schemes and plans ! " " I bet . " " L-1-let 's not tell him till we g-g-get to George 's . We can d-d-drink on it there . " " Excellent . That 's excellent . " Betsy squeezed his arm . " But you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They walked into the reek of rancid beer , through the barroom , pushing their way through the mob of sailors , soldiers , men with beards and women with peasant dresses , fairies , old drunks and young bums , into the blare of jazz in the back , and found a table on top of the music . " We 're switching ! " Bunty yelled to the waiter . " We 're switchingto bourbon , the three of us ! " " With Coke for me , " Betsy added . " I have to stick to Coke so I wo n't get drunk , do n't I , Joe ? " The drinks came almost before they were settled . Bunty picked up his shot glass and said bravely , " Let 's drink to the f-f-f-f-f  --  " He stopped and tried again . " To the future . " " You think there 's going to be one ? " " Now Joe "  --  Betsy wagged her head cautioningly  --  " do n't start with the apocalypse . I get that at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bunty , " Who 's going to break the news ? You or me ? " " We 'll do it together , " Bunty said . The drunker he got , the easier it became for him to talk without struggling . " We 'll take t-t-turns . " " You start ! " " It 's like this , Joey boy . Tonight 's the night . We w-w-want you to be in on it with us . " " In on what ? " Joe asked sharply , but before either of them could answer , a tall , thin Negro sailor , natty and limber in his summer whites , had placed himself between Joe and Betsy and was leaning forward confidentially . He smiled politely and said , half to Joe and half to Betsy , " Could I have the pleasure of this dance ? " " I 'm sorry , " Joe said , " but we 're  --  " " I 'd love to , " Betsy broke in . " That 's why I 'm here . Excuse me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirling away from them like a ballerina . " What 's the idea ? " Bunty asked furiously . " What kind of m-m-man are you , letting her dance with a n-n-nigger ! " " You want to stop her ? Do it yourself . " " She 'd be s-s-sore . " " You 're damn right . " " Besides , you 're bigger than me . It was your p-p-place . " Joe did n't answer . Bunty stared glumly at his glass for a moment . Then his face creased into a grin . " Y-y-you did n't makeout at all with her this summer , did you ? " " Maybe I was n't after what you were . " " And m-m-maybe you never knew , n-n-not till this minute , what I was after . I w-w-warned you , you would n't listen . And n-n-now you 're out in the cold , are n't you , unless I decide to cut you in ? " " What do you mean ? " Instead of answering , Bunty raised his head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowdedp165dance floor . They moved beautifully together , gliding naturally into a series of jitterbug steps that caught the attention of the other dancers , who moved aside to give them more room . " Boy , " Bunty said fervently , " can you imagine her old man 's f-f-face if he saw his little Betsy putting on a show with a n-nniggersailor ? " " How do you know so much about her father ? Did you ever meet him ? " Bunty finished his drink . " Not yet . But I 've been checking up on him  --  even f-f-followed him clear around Manhattan one day . " " What for ? " " C-curiosity . T-tell you one thing I learned  --  he ca n't afford to have his daughter in any trouble . " " Who can ? " " It 'll be worth real m-m-money to him to keep Betsy out of trouble . " " And you 're going to get her in trouble . " " Now you 've got it . You 're s-s-slow , but sooner or later you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he paused and winked  --  " we 're going to elope . Tonight . " The music stopped . In its echo , in the laughter , in the rattle of ice , the shuffle of feet across the scuffed floor , the screams of false delight , the matches being struck and the money changing hands , Joe could not only feel , he could have sworn he heard , a single drop of sweat work itself free from underneath his collar and roll like a snowball over his breastbone and down his chest into his navel . " You 're out of your head , " he said . " You ought to be locked up . " He pressed his hand to his chest , sliding it surreptitiously between his shirt buttons and onto the bare flesh . It came away wet . Betsy returned then , accompanied by the tall Negro sailor , who bowed punctiliously and declared , " Thank you . My pleasure . "  | " Mine too , " Betsy said . Her forehead was perspiring , and her bare arms glistened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance like that , Joe . " " It 's hot . Let 's wait awhile before we dance . " He touched her moist arm . " I hear you 're planning on getting married . " " He told you ! Is n't it exciting ? " There seemed to be nothing but a smooth , soft , yielding wall surrounding them both . No matter what he tried , no matter what he said , it was like pressing your thumb into a distended balloon . Desperately he looked for something sharp enough with which to prick them , but he could find nothing . " We figured "  --  Betsy gulped thirstily at a fresh drink  --  " we 'd drive down to Maryland in your car , the three of us . We could be there in no time . You 'll be our witness , wo n't that be something to remember ? " " I ca n't get gas , " he said stupidly . " Not out of town , . I can only get gas in North Jersey , where they know Blanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glove compartment , " Betsy said quickly . " I looked the other day . Your mother can always get more . " " It 's just before finals . Do you expect me to throw away the summer , to throw away my commission , for a drunken whim ? " It was no good , it was worse than no good , he was only talking to himself . " We 'll be back for finals , " she replied confidently . " I have n't let you down so far , have I ? If I have to , I 'll pass you the answersat the exam  --  Clapp expects that I will anyway ! " This last insult she handed him gaily , as if she were offering a new kind of cigarette . Maybe , he thought , if I can get her away . . . " Come on , " he said abruptly , " let 's dance . " Her body was warm , almost feverish , and it was pressed more tightly against his than it had ever been before , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this boyish figure could be so driven by urgencies which he could not even understand . Shep167tilted back her head and smiled coquettishly . " You do dance well . Not like that colored boy , but  --  " " You 're drunk . " " Do n't you like me drunk ? Do you think only Bunty should get drunk ? " " I do n't think you ought to make decisions unless you 're sober . " She pressed closer . " Will you take us if we all go out and have black coffee first ? Will you do that ? Will you ? " He could feel the bones of her back , fragile and young beneath the flesh , under his sweating hand . He said loudly , over the music , " I can understand Bunty . He 's crazy . If he had a grain of sense he 'd know it could n't go , but still I can see what he had in mind . But you  --  " " What do you mean ? What do you mean about Bunty ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work , but that 's what he wants . " " Pooh . " She laughed in his face ; the whisky on her breath was pungent and somehow stimulating . " Just mellerdrammer . You must be starved for excitement . " " What are you starved for , Betsy ? " He felt her stiffen in his arms . He went on hopefully , " I know you 're not attracted to him , not physically , not romantically . " " There are other things . " " What ? That 's what I want to know . What ? " He swung her around violently . " Look at him . How long could you stand it ? Is it worth it , just to spite your parents ? " " I knew that 's what you 'd think . I knew it . " She swayed unsteadilyin his arms . " I think you 're infantile . Changing your name from Betsy Felton to Mrs. Benton Traynor the Third wo n't make any dif-ference . " She broke away from him then and walked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumping couples . He let her4p168go , following slowly behind her . He had blundered onto it , that he knew , but as he watched her hurrying to Bunty he realized that what he had said could only make her more determined not to turn back . Bunty must have been working hard these last few weeks to build up to this triumph ; he had finally managed to get Betsy drunk , prepared her to become an accomplice in his crazy fantasy , drawn her finally into his dream world , even if he never got her any farther from suburban New Jersey than this litter of cigarette butts and potato-chip slivers floating in melting ice . " But what makes you think you can drag me into it ? " Joe asked him as soon as Betsy had left them to go to the bathroom . " You 'll never even leave here without my car . I wo n't lift a finger , I wo n't give you a nickel to get on the subway . " " It is n't money  --  Betsy 's got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he struggled with the word  --  " your participation . I know why you 've been a p-p-pal all summer  --  it 's the old quid pro quo . Now 's the time to c-c-cash in , kid . " " I 'm listening . " Bunty glanced around like a movie conspirator . " We 're g-g-going to have to stop someplace . Right ? We can s-stay together , the three of us . You know what I mean . I can f-f-fix it , believe me . " Why did there come to his mind 's eye a vision of his mother sitting alone in the parlor , the Turkish towel wrapped around her head , listening to the comforting ball game and playing solitaire ( now that she had finished the Ladies ' Home Journal ) , and hoping that perhaps he would come home early enough to have a sandwich and a glass of milk with her in the kitchen before going to bed ? Why did he see , too , Herman Felton , huddled in his underwear in the green pouch of a swaying Pullman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow , hurtling alone across the dark continent from one deal to the next , racing against time so that his daughter . . . A wave of nausea shook Joe as he sat with his eyes closed , and he could only wonder why he had never before admitted to himself the truth that must surely have worked its way into some corner of his mind once he had become morally certain of what must have taken place between Blanche and Herman Felton many years ago in Florida . In a way that he could never explain to anyone , not to Blance and not to Betsy either , he had to recognize Mr. Felton as a father , not simply as a symbolical parent but as a man who could with one thrust have been his actual father , just as he was Betsy 's actual and eternal father for all her desperate expedients to evade the fact . Any attitude toward Betsy on his own part that went beyond brotherly anxiety he would now have to consideras a crime , but against what ? His mother ? Herman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had shied from the only course that might have diverted Betsy from her fatal swingingtoward Bunty  --  a clear and unambiguous attempt to make her fall in love with him ? He opened his eyes and looked at Bunty . " I 'm not interested . I wo n't go with you , I wo n't take you . And I do n't think that you 'll take her . " There 's nothing he can do without me , Joe thought tiredly ; that 's what 's been wrong with his paranoid scheming all along : he tried to involve two people when he might have gotten away with it with just the one . " You 're so wrong , " Bunty said angrily . " If you d-d-do n't take us tonight , you 'll be sorry . If you like Betsy , y-y-you 'll be sorry . " " If you want a ride home tonight , do n't threaten me . I do n't like it . " " What about threats ? " asked Betsy . She had returned silently . She reached between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , waiting for one of them to answer . " Joe is being difficult , " Bunty said , without a stammer . " See if you can charm him . " Joe got to his feet and put his arm around her . " We 'll dance . "  | " Not right now . I feel a little dizzy . " He ignored her and swung her onto the dance floor . " I want to know how you could throw everything away . " " I do n't understand you . " She spoke into his shoulder . " Throw what away ? " " Your picture in the papers . Dancing with the military . The chance to be a belle in Washington , to be free , to do what you want . Your father is breaking his neck to get you those things . He 's succeeding . Do n't you want  --  " " Do you want me to go through life paying him back for his sacrifices ? I 'd rather pay him back for his hypocrisy . He loves it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington . He thinks he can buy his way right up to the top , and take me along as security . He wants me to be obligated to him for a career , a husband , anything I really want . But I do n't want anything I have to get through him . Ca n't you get that through your head ? " " But that 's why you said you disliked your brother  --  for just that reason , because he did n't want to take things from your father . You 're contradicting yourself . " " All right , so I 'm contradicting myself . Is it illegal ? " " Maybe you 've changed your mind . Maybe Bunty 's changed it for you . " " Maybe he has . At least he 's not a hypocrite . I 'm sick of the hypocrites . That goes for my father and all the so-called big shots who fawn over him because he can get them the things they want . " She shifted tensely in his arms . " You think the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be grateful for the parties and the pictures , like a kid with a lollipop . You 're both in for a big surprise , my friend . " The music stopped , but before he could move it had started again , the tall Negro sailor had appeared from nowhere and swung Betsy away , and he was left standing alone . He turned back to the table . Bunty had decided on a new tack . As Joe sat down he forcedp171a smile and said in a wheedling tone , " You take things too s-s-seriously , old boy . " " So it 's all a big joke . " " In a way . " He belched behind his fingers . " This is n't somethingthat 's going to last f-f-forever . Betsy gets her thrills , she becomes Mrs. Benton Traynor , and her old man f-f-fixes things with me so his baby can get an annulment . Who gets hurt ? I ask you. , , " And you think that 's all . He 'll buy you off , is that it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd squash you like a beetle . You ought to be thankful to me for not letting you do it . " " So you wo n't take us . " Bunty appraised him almost soberly . " No . " " L-1-let me tell you something . If you t-t-turn your back on us now , I 'm not taking Betsy home . I 'm going to sh-sh-shack up with her tonight . What do you think of that ? " What could you think ? It all depended on Betsy  --  and she was off at the other end of the room , spinning around with the Negro sailor , spinning wildly yet feebly , like a helpless , dying leaf . As calmly as he could , Joe said , " That wo n't do you any good . Unless you want to humiliate her , to make her compare herself with Peg . " " Shows how much you know . After tonight she 'll have to m-m-marry me . And d-d-do n't think , " he added venomously , " I 'll forget about Peg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . You 're out of your mind . " " Watch and see . " " No , thanks ! " He had to yell over a sudden trumpet blare . " I 'm going home . You can rot here . " He watched Betsy swaying toward them , limp , white-faced , and alone . Her dancing partner had disappeared , and from her sleepwalker 's glide and the stilted smile on her face Joe guessed why . He stood up and reached for her arm . " Are you all right ? " " Just drunk , thanks . Do you mind ? "  | " Listen to me . It 's quarter to three . I 'm going . I 'll take you both home if you want . My car is n't far from here  --  if you want I 'll bring it to the front door . " He could hardly bear to watch their heads turn as they eyed each other , measuring , testing their strength . Bunty 's hands moved convulsively , his eyelids fluttered . He was ready to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " I 'll stay here with Bunty . You can go home to Mama . " Joe kicked over his chair . " I mean it . I 'm leaving . You can cool off in the car ; we 'll open the windows . " But the moment had passed . Bunty was grinning now , and Betsy said only , " You heard me . " " The hell with you both . " He had taken several steps away from them when Betsy called after him , " Oh Joe ! " He turned expectantly , and she said in a clear , high voice , " Straighten out the bill on your way out . We may need our money for other things . " Heads turned , people laughed . Numbly he sought the waiter . " I want to pay for my part , " he said . " Give me a separate check . " " Half ? " " No . Just what I drank . " In a few hours it would be getting light , but the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomiters , howlers , screamers . The saviors of the land and their maidens were on the loose , Joe thought bitterly as he reached his mother 's car . Its windows were covered with wax scrawls . He moistened his handkerchief and rubbed as hard as he could , but it was no good ; the wax would have to be scraped off . He drove home slowly , drunk with fury as well as with liquor , peering through the senseless waxen circles , and when he coasted into the garage it seemed to him that the false dawn was already touching objects  --  an oil can , a garden rake , a bundleof old newspapers  --  which he could not have seen an hour earlier . He crept into the kitchen and then to his bedroom ,  |p173knowing  at least that there was one more thing he could do just a few hours from now , one more act of revenge against the crazy conspiracy . He set his alarm for seven-thirty , stripped to his shorts , and fell asleep almost at once , dreaming of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny at first , as the squad car that was after him pulled up to the curb with sirens screaming . From his hideout he counted twenty-seven cops clambering from the car , gasping as they came . But their guns had real bullets , and their faces were distorted with rage . He ran for the roof as they thundered up the stairs after him , and in the instant that he turned he was horrified to see that it was a little army of identicaltwins charging him with guns and nightsticks . Clinging to the chimney , he looked out over a choppy , jagged sea of rooftops and realized that he was in Paris . It made him feel better , and he leaped from one rooftop to the next , easily outdistancing the cops , who were panting after him , aided now by baying French poodles . He decided to disappear from sight , and he picked a skylight that was ajar to swing into , dropping down with an acrobatic flourish into a huge bare attic studio where a bearded artist in smock and beret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nude blonde . It was perfectly obvious that , behind the false beard , the artist was Clapp the physics instructor  --  even his smock was really his lab coat . He screamed in fright as his disguise was penetrated and ran off through an open door with his palette still hanging from his thumb like a dangling breadboard . The model had hastily thrown a dressing gown over her shoulders , but she was extremely sympathetic , inviting him to share with her a potatochipsandwich and a bottle of rum . They conversed in fluent French , of which she was enormously proud for some reason that he could not understand , since she was a native of Paris and he was only a tourist . But he decided not to raise the question , especially when she began to pet him , folding him in her arms and cradling his head against her bosom . It was terriblyp174exciting ; he could feel her smooth and slippery flesh at will , as much as he wanted , beneath the iridescent dressing gown , on which was imprinted , he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing with arrows the principal engagements of the American and Japanese fleets . As he squeezed her here and there , coasting along the luxuriantly curved buttock and marvelingat the hefty swell of thigh , he felt himself growing hard and strong , and she murmured her appreciation of his masculinity ; but when he looked up from the wonderfully comfortable pillow of her breast he was shocked to discover that this was his mother and that he was an overgrown boy of six , dangling from her lap . At once he lost interest in her , but as he jumped hastily to his feet she was n't his mother any more . She tore off the dressinggown , revealing a tight bathing suit ; while he wondered if he had been stroking the bathing suit instead of the girl , she challenged him to a swimming race and led him around her dressing screen to a gigantic pool on both sides of which bleachers , running up and away , held thousands of screamin , g spectators , whose waving pennants snapped in the open air . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Adolf Hitler seated in a reviewing stand in their midst ; blue uniforms on the left , with Herman Felton observing him through binoculars from his side . It 's the Olympics , he thought with a sinking heart , and I can hardly swim . The model leaped in at once and began to swim away with extraordinary speed ; he plunged in and took after her , but the more he thrashed , the farther away she was , growing fainter and fainter until she had completely disappeared and he was left gasping in the blue water with his strength giving out and his lungs bursting . He was hauled from the water in a huge net that was cranked up by a construction crane , and tangled with him in the net was Runty Traynor , laughing hysterically and elbowing him painfullyin the ribs . They were dropped in a broad , desolate field , and when Bunty asked him where his mother 's car was , since they could n't possibly walk clear across the field to the station , he got a malicious satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had the keys . " If I have the keys , I 'll drive , " Bunty said triumphantly , hiding his stammer behind a bushy mustache that he had grown for the occasion , and Joe was heartbroken to discover that Bunty was absolutely correct . They drove right on the railroad tracks , no matter how much Joe protested that his mother 's tires were being torn up and could n't be replaced without bribing Mr. Hummel , the Nazi butcher . But it was Mr. Hummel himself who was waiting at the station as they pulled in , waving Joe 's 1A card that he had typed out himself , and blowing the whistle for a locomotive draped with bunting that was puffing in on the next track . As they climbed out of the car a group of spindly and ragged college students , led by Murray Goldstone , began to unroll a long red carpet directly from the train . Mussolini stepped out grandly , arm-in-arm with the Negro sailor who had been dancing with Betsy . They chatted together in Russian as they walked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bunty to ask him what these two were doing together in New York , but just then a bell began to ring wildly and insistently and the students dropped the half-unrolled carpet and scattered in all directions . " School ! " they cried . " School ! " as the bell continued to ring , louder and louder , and Bunty grasped him by the hand and began to run . Joe broke loose and woke up . He staggered to the bureau and slammed the palm of his hand down hard on the alarm . There was more , he thought groggily ; my God , I must have been dreaming for hours ; there was a battle , a trapdoor , Siberia , a duel with lead pencils . . . Maybe it was better to be awake , even after only a couple of hours of sleep . He crossed to the window in his bare feet , raised the shade , and peered out at the back yard . It was a brilliant morning , cloudless and bright . What a day it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard to the driveway : the folding door was slung overhead ; thep176garage was a yawning box . Blanche had gone already , early as a baker , watching her chef frying breakfast eggs for all the empty stomachs . The house was deserted . In the bathroom he threw cold water gingerly at his face with his fingertips and rinsed his mouth with Blanche 's Listerine until his tongue shrank to more manageable proportions . He tried speaking aloud , standing in the empty hallway before the little reproduction of the Gilbert Stuart George Washington that had been his father 's . " Good evening , George , " he said . " My name is Joseph Andrew Burley . It 's going to be hot as hell today . I am a white male , in prime physical condition . . . " He sat down at the telephone stand and dialed the Felton number quickly , before he had time to lose his nerve . Which will it be , he wondered , waiting , listening  --  sleepy Mama or sharpeyedDaddy ? " Hel-lo . " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Felton ? This is Joe Burley . I hope I 'm not calling too early , but I have to talk to Betsy about our schoolwork . You know , finals are coming up , and we have to get together to do some cramming . " " But she is n't up yet . " He laughed to himself . " I wonder if you 'd just knock at her door and tell her I 'm on the phone . I know she wo n't be angry  --  she 's expecting to hear from me . " " Well "  --  lazy as could be , hating the climb up the stairs and then down  --  " all right . Hold on . " " I 'll hold . " Surprise , surprise , he thought . I only hope it is n't too much for her heart when she opens that door  --  and then what ? A scene ? tears ? fake calmness ? Mrs. Felton was back so soon that he was startled . " Hello ! Joe ! She 's not in her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never got home ! The bed is still made , she 's not in the house . " Her voice began to break . " She must have been hurt.  |p177An  accident  --  maybe she was murdered , she 's been gone since suppertime  --  " " I 'm sure there 's nothing wrong , Mrs. Felton , " he said soothingly . " If there 'd been an accident you would have been notified , would n't you ? " " But I do n't know what to do . My husband  --  " " Did n't she tell him where she was going ? Maybe she stayed over at a friend 's house ? Maybe it was too late for her to get a train and she did n't want to phone you so late . " " Mr. Felton is n't here . He 's away on business . Listen , maybe you could call back later , or else  --  " " Whatever you say , Mrs. Felton . But really , I would n't worry if I were you . " But he was talking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard sounds at the other end , almost like scuffling , and loud voices , and then it was Herman Felton on the phone  --  not out of town , but right there . " Mr. Burley , this is Betsy 's father "  --  hard and cold , and without any apology for his wife 's white lie , simply taking it for granted that now he was here and wanted an answer . " Did you see her last night ? " " I saw her , yes . " " Where ? " " In a night club . " He cleared his throat . " With a fellow named Traynor , Bunty Traynor . But you do n't  --  " " Did you leave them there ? " Joe hesitated . " Yes , I did . I offered to drive them home , but they were n't ready to leave . " " What 's your address ? I 've got a pencil here . " Joe could hear him scratching away industriously , putting down the information . " I 've got it , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . I want you should drive into New York with me "  --  no please , no requests , just the straight executive statement . " If you think it 's necessary , or I can help  --  " " We can talk on the way in . Good-by. "  |p178He  was sitting on the front steps , eating an orange , when Mr. Felton drove up in his Dodge . He swallowed the last section quickly and dropped the long circlet of peel surreptitiously into the milkbox , a surprise for Blanche , then walked down to the curb as Mr. Felton leaned over and opened the door for him . Mrs. Felton was sitting in the back seat where she belonged , making room for him to sit up front with her husband . She had no make-up on , and she looked shocking in the bright morning sunlight . Her dewlaps hung flaccidly , and her nose was red and shiny , compressed to a point by the handkerchief held against it by her ringed fingers . A huge diamond that Joe could not rememberhaving seen before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My wife thought she should stay home and wait for the telephone , " Mr. Felton said without any introductory remarks . " No sense to that . She 'll be better off with us . She 's got a heart murmur , and I do n't want her to be there alone . If Betsy comes back while we 're gone , she can let herself in . I left her a note to phone my secretary ; I 'll be in touch with her . " Joe turned halfway around . He said heartily , " Do n't you worry , Mrs. Felton . I know everything is all right . " " She never stayed away . Not without permission , not since high school . " Mrs. Felton sniffed . " It 's nice of you to go with us like this . I know you 're worried about your exams . Betsy told us they mean a lot to you . " " Oh , that 's all right . " Without taking his eyes from the road , Mr. Felton said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village . " " What time did you leave ? " " It was pretty late  --  I guess about three o'clock . " Joe shifted about . " But you would n't find anybody there at this hour . " " I was n't thinking of doing that . " Mr. Felton spoke curtly . His hands were curled so tightly around the steering wheel thatp179the little bushes of black hair stood out individually from his taut knuckles . His mouth was clamped shut too . Joe wondered what they would say if he turned on the auto radio . Would they want to hear the news broadcast ? Or would they be angry for his intruding on their grief or anger or whatever it was they were feeling ? Instead , he cranked down the window to release some of the staleness and said over his shoulder , " Too much for you , Mrs. Felton ? " She shook her head wordlessly , her handkerchief pressed to her nose . They rode in silence after that for ten or fifteen minutes . Finally Mr. Felton said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not so much by this rupture of the silence as by Herman Felton 's last word , which sounded particularly odd coming from his lips . Joe could think of no reply , so he waited for Mr. Felton to go on . " I 've found out a little about him . He 's taking advantage of my daughter , Mr. Burley . She has n't had much experience with boys , I guess you know that by now . He did , and he tried to take advantage . But believe me , he 's going to be sorry . With all due respect , it 's a terrible mistake , Jew and gentile trying to break down the barriers . I have always insisted to her that it 's a waste of time to go out with gentile boys . It 's worse than that , it 's a gyp , a crime . Now we have the consequences . " " But what about ordinary life ? We all have to live and work together , even fight together . " " A big difference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toprovide for your family , sometimes you 've got to do things you 'd think about twice otherwise . It 's a dog-eat-dog world ; your mother knows that ; ask her , she 'll tell you . Those are two different things . If you want to take care of your own you 've got to be ready to mix with people you would n't have in your house , you 've got to give a big smile to men that you would n't want near your wife or your daughter . " We 're not talking about that . We 're talking about that which is sacred  --  marriage , love , children . You 've got to showp180me where you can have those between Jew and gentile . It 's against God 's law . I 'll tell you something from the benefit of my own experience . " He paused . " A cousin of my wife 's once married a gentile girl . He could n't stop telling me how much he was in love . All right , I said , but wait till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments . Then what happens ? What names will she call you ? I do n't deny , I said , she might be the nicest girl in the world , but she wo n't be able to help herself , she 'll use the words that are bred in the bone . I do n't have to tell you , Mr. Burley ; you 're an intelligent young man ; it happenedjust like I warned him . He was sorry , he cried  --  but it was too late then , was n't it ? " " Do n't bother his head with those stories , Herman , " his wife put in . It was the first time she had spoken . " You do n't have to tell him about family tragedies . " " It 's applicable , is n't it ? Now we 're in another family tragedy , are n't we ? What else would you call it ? " Mr. Felton slapped the steering wheel with his palm and spoke sharply , returning to his earlier , curt manner . " I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things with young fellows . If you wanted to take a girl to a hotel for overnight , where would you go ? What hotel ? " " Well , I do n't  --  " " That 's all right , just tell me . " " I hear that the Southland is popular with sailors . I never stayed there myself , Mr. Felton , but they say it 's easy to take girls there . Of course almost any hotel in midtown  --  " Mr. Felton glanced tensely at his gold wristwatch . " We have n't got too much time . We 'll try the Southland first . " His wife said , " Herman , how do you know  --  ? " " We 've got to do what we can do . Let 's not argue now . " When they got to Forty-second Street the heat was already rising from the street , the tar was melting in shiny patches , the trolleys were rocking slowly and painfully on the crosstown tracks as if even they were oppressed by the baking sun . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream , their shirt fronts stained with unbidden sweat ; even the sputtering neon signs of the girlie movies , the continuous jewelry auctions , and the checker parlors , blinked weakly and agonizedly , utterly unable to outshine the glare of the sun reflected in store windows , windshields , and chromium bumpers . The street was so deserted that you could see all the way across past the library , almost to Grand Central , and , in the other direction , halfway to the Forty-second Street Ferry : no private cars ; a scattering of grunting taxicabs with their hoods propped ajar , wallowing yellowly in the bright sun like panting porkers ; and on the sidewalks only an occasional shuffleof bums , empty-eyed , lifeless ones , buying tickets to **25;8416;TOOLONG at nine o'clock in the morning , and sailors blinking their way exhaustedly out of the night 's debaucheryor meandering vainly but with an irrepressible hopefulnesslike alley cats , searching for something that moved , breathed , or smelled . Mr. Felton parked the car directly in front of the hotel and slid out dexterously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered , and walked unflinchingly , a neat , trim , undespairing little figure , through the dazzle and glare into the recess of the narrow lobby . For the first time Joe felt really sorry for him , as he charged forward on his hot , hopeless mission , with no protectionbut his nattily ribboned summer straw and the two questionable allies waiting uneasily in his broiling automobile . Joe swung about , feeling the sweat rise up protestingly between his shoulder blades , and said to Mrs. Felton , " I really do n't think we 'll get any place this way . " She was alarmingly pale . She smiled whitely . " You ca n't argue with my husband . " Was it pride in her voice ? She continued , " He usually gets what he 's after . He 'll find Betsy . " What am I trapped with ? he wondered . This can go on forever ; we can float through the city , slowly frying on red-hotp182tires , the three of us , from blank hotel to blank hotel , while Betsy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing at us . Herman Felton slipped out of the clutch of the revolving door , his face expressionless until the sun forced him to screw up his eyes and frown . He climbed in behind the wheel and said , " This is illogical . We 're going about it wrong . " What the hell did you expect ? Joe wanted to reply ; this is a nightmare , a man-made nightmare ; but there was an accusing note in Mr. Felton 's voice which kept him silent . " Now look , " Mr. Felton said sharply , " this bum , he 's very proud of his family , is n't he ? He thinks he 's pretty swell , does n't he ? " " That 's right . " " Then he 'd never go to a place like that . " He indicated the hotel with a swift jerk of his head . " But they must have gone to a hotel , am I right ? " Joe considered . He answered slowly , " I suppose so . Unless they took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " " They were drinking , " Joe said weakly . " You ca n't tell  --  But no , they had nothing with them , not even a toothbrush . It must be a hotel . " " I thought of all this before . The question is , where ? A character like that with big ideas , he 's down in the Village , he would n't come up here . He 'd go to the Fifth Avenue  --  or the Brevoort . " Mr. Felton was right , of course . It was so obvious , so logical , that Joe leaned back and allowed himself to be chauffeured comfortably downtown , hypnotically confident that the quarry would be found downtown , and that this was not a mad hunt but a coldly sensible rescue expedition that would soon be successfullycompleted . His companions spoke no more , there was no need for him to maintain a conversational flow , and he felt himself sinkingp183into a mindless stupor from which he was awakened only when Mr. Felton made a sharp U-turn on Fifth Avenue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brevoort . The heat seemed more well-bred here , its breathlessness muted , and the sluggish movement of life refined to a more graceful crawl . Doormen were walking dogs sleepily down to the Arch ; a doctor opened the first-floor casement window of his office and yawned ; across the street the waiters were bringing out the chairs of the Fifth Avenue Hotel 's sidewalk restaurant and lowering the awning against the heavy hand of the sun . " You 'd better come in with me here , " Mr. Felton said quietly . " Keep hold of yourself , Clara . We 'll be out soon . " Why , Joe wondered as he followed him into the lobby and up the steps to the registration desk , did he want company now  --  was he afraid of what he would find , or was he so convinced of his intuitive powers that he wanted a witness to their magnitude ? Joe stood back discreetly as Mr. Felton walked up to the counter , placed his fingertips on its metal lip as though it were a keyboard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud , firm voice , " Let me see your register , please . " The room clerk swung around a small leather volume of fiveby-eightcards and placed it before Mr. Felton , who adjusted the bows of his glasses with pedantic care , fitting them snugly to his ears , and bent forward to examine the cards . He put his thumb down on one card and said something inaudible to the clerk , who raised his eyebrows in surprise and promptly shook his head . Mr. Felton stepped back from the counter , put his hands in his pockets , and spoke in a voice that carried to Joe at his post on the arm of a couch . " Get me your boss . " It was like watching a silent movie . The clerk was back in a moment with an elderly ambassador , who also shook his head sorrowfully . Mr. Felton did not grow angry , as Joe expected him to do . He hunched his shoulders like a fighter tensing for a blow , and shot his arm out in a left jab so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your telephone . "  |p184Deliberately  he turned his back on them and , half-facing Joe , he dialed a number , his hand moving so swiftly that it seemed merely to be passing over the telephone , flicking at it as it moved . With his hand to the mouthpiece so that no one could hear what he was saying , he spoke briefly for only a moment or two , and then handed the instrument wordlessly to the ambassador , as though he were doing him , a favor . Joe could hardly keep from laughing , watching the play of emotions across the man 's face  --  it was like looking through a window at a child being scolded by its mother . The elderly man nodded at the telephone several times in rapid succession , his face crumpling , pinched in the effort to keep from bursting into tears . He said , " Of course , of course , I understand , that 's perfectlyall right , I 'll be happy to , yes , good-by now , " hung up , and turned to Mr. Felton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For his part Mr. Felton glanced over his shoulder at Joe , not proudly or arrogantly , but in a matter-of-fact way , like a king ascertaining if a courtier is still in waiting for the royal presence ; he jerked his head toward the elevator and strode forward , without waiting for Joe to join him , moving briskly across the empty floor with short , quick strides . Joe hastened after him , marveling at his assurance , at the speed with which he had utilized the telephone to strike the decisive blow . They met at the entrance to the elevator , under the eye of the bored operator . " He did n't want me to go up without contacting the room first , " Mr. Felton said brusquely . " Afraid of the law . Afraid because I would n't tell him who I am and who 's upstairs . Why should I ? None of his business . " He stood in the cage with his legs apart and his hands clasped before him . In a moment they were joined by the ambassador , tiptoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shirt front splashed with cigarette ashes and a gnarled hand which clenched a thick bunch of keys . " I straightened him out in a hurry , " Mr. Felton went onp185without so much as a side glance , speaking exactly as though the other two were not pressing against his side . " No sense fooling around . Now we 'll know yes or no . " " Four , please , John , " their guide said to the operator in a surprisingly deep , tender voice . They rumbled up together in silence . The operator groaned open the iron door , and the four stalkers marched silently down the sagging corridor . The corridor seemed endless . The faded walls were no longer parallel ; the beams were yielding from the century-long effort of holding the building together ; and there was a faintly foul , musty odor seeping up from the moldings as they moved Indian file along the threadbare carpet . They stopped at a room near the red-globed stairway exit . The keeper of the keys raised his hand and knocked smartly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key . " Step aside , " said Mr. Felton in a high , unnatural voice . He brushed everyone out of his way and planted himself before the closed door . The door opened . Betsy stuck out her head inquiringly , holding the door just far enough ajar for her to peer out into the corridor . She held a toothbrush in her hand , and there was a white smear of toothpaste , like a child 's milk mustache , above her upper lip . Her nostrils flared like a filly 's , and her irises seemed to darken , the pupils contracting as though a sudden light were being flashed in her eyes , but otherwise she gave no sign of surprise . " Hello , Daddy , " she said . " Let me in , " her father said . Standing behind him , feeling the hair rising on his scalp , Joe could see Mr. Felton 's ears whiten and his jawbone shift . Betsy opened the door wide and waved them in with a gracioussweep of her toothbrush . " How did you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Joe behind everyone else . " Ah , " she said , " I might have known . " She eyed him appraisingly , almost admiringly , as if she were silently congratulatingp186him for the audacity of his vindictiveness . But she swiveled about with a flirt of her skirt  --  she was fully dressed  --  and turned her back on him . The room was large , ancient , and airless . It smelled even a little stronger than the corridor ; a chromo hung askew on the mottled wall , the furnishings were rotten and hopeless . You might have thought the five of them were gathering for a clandestine political meeting , except for the washbasin by the window , where Betsy 's comb and a ten-cent tube of Ipana toothpaste rested on the yellowed rim of the bowl  --  except for that and for the brass bed at the other end of the room , on which Bunty lay like an aimlessly flung sack of bones , the sheet drawn up to his chin and his clothing scattered on the floor at the foot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Betsy asked her father , ignoring Joe and the others . " Just what you looked forward to seeing , I suppose . I hate to disappoint you , but nothing happenedhere last night , aside from some disgusting snoring . " " Shut your mouth . " Mr. Felton took a spotless linen handkerchieffrom his breast pocket and rubbed his hands as though he had touched something unclean ; his arms were trembling violently . " Wipe off the toothpaste and get your things together . Your mother is waiting outside . " " Am I being rescued or punished ? " Mr. Felton 's hand , still clutching the end of the handkerchief , whipped out and slashed Betsy across the cheek with it . The handkerchief flicked whitely , crack , and the Irishman said in the shocked silence , " Hey , now ! " But no one moved . Betsy stared at her father with a new expression , then turned to the discolored mirror above the washbasin and touched her fingertips to the red welt that crossed her face from the loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smear on her upper lip . " You 'd never believe me , would you ? " she said . " You do n't even want to . You want it the other way , it gives you a thrill . " i " I want to get out of this stinkhole . Wipe your mouth . " " Yes , Daddy . " Bunty had been lying quietly on his back , watching the conversationbetween Betsy and her father with his fingernails pressed to his teeth . Now he reached under the pillow for a handkerchief and blew his nose . Thus reminded , the elderly man glared at him venomously and said , " You ca n't just lie there . You 'll have to vacate . " " Vacate yourself . I 'm in my sh-sh-shorts . I 'm not getting dressed until you 1-1-leave . " " Get a move on , or we 'll call the police . " Bunty laughed . " Why do n't you t-t-tell him that ? What do you say , Mr. Felton ? Would n't that be a d-d-dandy idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him . When Betsy had thrown toothbrush , toothpaste , and Kleenex into the wastebasket and picked up her purse , he held the door open for her with formal politeness , as though she were not his daughter but a stranger he had just met . " So long , kid , " Bunty called out to Betsy . " S-s-see you in church  --  or will it be in synagogue ? " The Irishman prodded the bedclothes with the tip of a huge key . " You 've got five minutes to get out . " But when Betsy too ignored him , Bunty suddenly reared up in bed like a frightened , angry , wounded animal and began to curse . It seemed to Joe that he could count every rib of Bunty 's narrow , heaving chest . " You w-w-want to know something , Mr. Felton ? " he shouted . " You know why nothing happened ? BecauseI would n't let it happen . I w-would n't do it , I refused , you can give me credit for that ! But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , she  --  " Mr. Felton whirled about as if goaded beyond endurance ; Joe was astonished to see that he was crying . In a voice chokedwith tears he yelled , " I spit on you ! " and slammed the door . There were six now in the elevator going down , including theoperator , whose labored asthmatic breathing punctuated the dryp188rattle of the cable chain in the airless shaft . Betsy pulled away from Joe 's hand at her elbow . " You had to be in at the kill . " " Your father insisted . " Joe bent over and whispered into her ear . " What difference does it make ? You 've never wanted to believe me  --  you wo n't believe me now , any more than your father believes you . So think what you like  --  that 's what your father 's doing . " She glanced at him distantly ( already the welt on her cheek was fading ) , her father blew his nose , the ambassador whispered something to his wizened retainer , the doors opened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car Mr. Felton said to Joe , " I want to thank you . You 've been a good sport . I know I do n't have to ask you not to say anything about this . " " Really , I just did n't want to be in the way . " " There 's one more thing . I know it 's an imposition , but if you could drive my wife and daughter home  --  " " I have to go back to the Island anyway . " " I 'd appreciate it . " He glanced at his watch . " There 's a plane I can still catch if I get to the airlines terminal on Forty-second Street in about twenty minutes . " He looked at his daughter . " Your mother 's got to rest . Do n't try to work on her sympathies ; she 's had enough strain for one day . We 'll talk next week when I get home . In the meantime I 'll write you . If it 's true what you say  --  that nothing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't you ? First a little lesson about appearances , then a happy  --  " Mr. Felton sat down beside his sobbing wife and slammed the back door . " Hello , mama , " Betsy said as she settled herself next to Joe . " You were n't worried about me , were you ? " " Turn around , " her father said sharply . No one opened his mouth after that until Joe parked the car in front of the airlines terminal . Then Mr. Felton kissed his wife chastely on the cheek , extracted his luggage from the trunk ,  |p189and  took Joe 's hand formally . " Thank you again . You can take the car after you drop them off  --  return it at your convenience . " During the rest of the trip Joe felt like a hackie at the wheel of a taxi , with two uncommunicative female passengers . Betsy answered his tentative remarks with nothing more than monosyllables , and Mrs. Felton said nothing until she snuffled her thanks at her front door . Only then did Betsy say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth while . You had fun . " " What do you mean ? " " It 's all been comical , has n't it ? A scene from a cheap farce . That 's the way you 'll remember me . " " No , " he said slowly , " that 's not so . I do n't know exactly  --  but it 's not like that . " The next time he saw Betsy she was sitting under a tree , chewing a blade of grass on the campus lawn not far from the physics building . It was only the afternoon after their last parting , but that  --  and the events preceding it  --  had receded so swiftly into the near-forgotten past , like a movie seen years beforeand dimly remembered , that Joe wondered blindly , Was it only yesterday ? Was it yesterday morning that we dreamed we broke open the bedroom door and found Betsy cowering under the sink , trying to hide behind a toothbrush ? Betsy spoke without reserve about Bunty and the collapse of their plans . Yet it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she had never even seen the movie . She behaved as though there was no reason on earth why she should be other than casual and self-possessed . Her coolness , although it was infectious , was frightening . It smelled too strongly of an infantile refusal to face the facts of the situation , to understand what had actually happened to her . For the first time since he had met her Joe was shaken with a chill fear that some force deep within her was driving her away from reality , into a world which someday no one else would be able to enter . He was on his knees before her in the crushedp190damp grass , the wind overhead ruffled the heavily enfoliaged branches of the old oak , and Betsy looked innocently into his eyes , mild and untroubled as a child . " If you had only gone through with it , " she said cheerfully , reasonably , " the whole business with the hotel room would n't have come up . " " But how could I have ? " he asked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole ridiculous scheme hung on the idea that I would be fool enough to be your best man , your sucker , your nitwit ? Did you really think that there was n't any end to the conniving , that curiosity or hope would drag me on past the point where anybody with a grain of sense would have to call it quits ? " " I speak to you with cold logic . But you 're simply emotional . " " Then tell me , coldly and logically , what you 've gained . What has Bunty gained ? What has your father gained ? " " I had an experience . " For an instant he fancied that he could see once again the thin red line made by her father 's handkerchief . " I do n't know how you 'd measure it ; but I made something happen . You talk about hope . What do you know about that ? What does anybody in this world know about it ? My father called Mama last night , long distance . And he wrote me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane . I 'm not going to show it to you  --  " " I did n't ask you to . " "  --  but what it comes down to is that there 's still hope for me . I must learn from experience and listen to my daddy . Mama tells me if I mind my manners and prove that I 'm not going wild I 've got a good chance to get sent West in the fall . " " West ? " " California . College . Nice Jewish boys , and a good mathematicsdepartment to keep my mind occupied while I 'm hunt-ing . " " You can joke , but that sounds pretty decent . " " Speaking of jokes , Mama wanted to know why did Buntyp191and I have to stay in the same room . She thought he should have taken me to the Y if I had to stay over , or the Barbizon . And if it was a question of money , was a double room so much cheaper than two singles ? She does n't know how close she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He did n't come off too well , did he ? " Betsy frowned . " But of course you have to share the responsibility for that . He 's being expelled . He told me just an hour ago it was for cutting classes . I do n't believe him . I think Daddy did a job on him . " " You still have faith in your father 's magic powers . But he has n't even been here hand there is n't much he ca n't do . " Joe said slowly , remembering Herman Felton taking command of the telephone at the desk of the Brevoort , " I believe that . But Bunty ca n't admit to himself , much less to you , that he 's no match for your father . I warned him . " " Did you really ? " Betsy asked politely . " Well , I expect I 'll be seeing him before he and his mother leave Ridgewood . They 'll have to , you know . But it 's not the same between us any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind about that . I do n't want to talk about it . What about you and me ? " " We 'll be pen pals . You 'll be in California , I 'll be in Peoria or Patagonia . I 'll tell you what . Whenever you 're tempted to stray , think of me , brother Joe , and of how I 'd feel about it . I 'll serve in the place of Morrow . " Betsy flushed . " So that 's it ! I 've felt it all along . I think my father did too . He never worried about you and me , not really , not the way he did about Bunty . " " I 'm a friend of the family "  --  he could not resist adding  --  " especially after yesterday . You might even say I 'm a kind of relative , a brother once removed . " Betsy glanced up at him queerly as he got to his feet . " Helpp192me up , will you ? " she asked , extending her arms in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drew her to her feet ; as she arose the breeze caught her skirt , blowing it high for the instant that her hands were captured and unable to hold it down . He had a glimpse of her hardy knee  --  bruised for the moment with a cross-hatching of green , a brief keepsake of the campus  --  and her smooth girl 's thigh , succulent and unscarred as a baby 's wholesome flesh . " That 's what you 've been trying to do all summer , is n't it ? " she said as they walked slowly to the physics building and their final afternoon together . " What ? " " To help me up , in your own clumsy way . But up to where ? That you never knew , did you , any more than I. It does n't make any difference , though . I think I like you anyway . " She smiled brilliantly . " And if you like me too , why then we 've salvaged something , have n't we ? " Instead of answering ( how could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of chapters in a romance , despite her defensive chatter about logic and hardheadedness ; it was impossible to sweep away the clutter , to show her that what had happened so far was only a bitter foretaste of the poison she would have to swallow in the future ) , he took her by the hand as he had wanted to do ever since they first met ; and so , hand in hand like Hansel and Gretel , they strolled forward together to prepare for their final examinations . There was still one unfinished item of the summer 's business , Joe thought as he parked the car in his driveway and walked to the kitchen door : a last word with Bunty , a finale that would give him more satisfaction than the memory of Bunty lying naked and alone in the old bed in the Brevoort Hotel . The telephone was ringing as he entered the empty kitchen  --  the clock on the wall said five-fifteen , but already it seemed asp193though days instead of minutes had passed since he had last seen Betsy  --  and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be at the other end . He reached it at last and said breathlessly , " Hello ! " " Joe ? " This is B-bunty . Am I glad to get you ! " " I hear you 've been expelled . " " News travels fast . I 've been ce-ce-celebrating all afternoon . " " You sound drunk . " " Of course I do . I am . Old pal , I need your help . I 'm st-st-stuck here , and I  --  " " It 's a shame for your mother , " Joe said with satisfaction . " She must be terribly upset . " " Do n't w-worry about her . She 's been restless anyway ever since she heard about their c-c-closing down the track at M-m-monmouth for the duration . M-m-maybe she can get me into V-v-vassar . She 'd be happier there than here  --  it 's her alma m-m-mater . But listen , I 'm at Frank 's . You remember the place . " " Where you got that man to buy you a drink ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He c-c-caught me in the men 's room without a M-m-marine uniform and beat me up , to t-t-teach me a lesson . Here I am , all c-c-cut up , and my shirt 's torn , and F-f-ferd  --  you remember him , the bartender  --  hew-wants me to get out , and I have n't got m-mmoneyfor a cab , and I 'm out here in the m-m-middle of no place . " Joe laughed happily . " So can you c-c-come out and p-p-pick me up ? It 's not so far ; it wo n't t-take you long . " Joe said reassuringly , " You give me about fifteen or twenty minutes , will you , Bunty ? Will you do that ? " " Sure , Joe . T-t-tell you what . I 'll wait out in the p-p-parkinglot . It 's hot as a w-witch 's tit outside , but F-f-ferd wo n't b-b-bother me if I wait out there . " " You do that . I 'll leave this minute . " He laughed again asp194he hung up . He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , drew the blind , and stretched out comfortablyon the couch , his head on one pillow , his feet on another . He 's got a long wait in that parking lot , he thought luxuriously as he turned to the war communiques on page two  --  a good long wait ; almost as long as if he was a Marine on patrol . Tracing his finger along the battle map that would be more real to him very soon , he drifted off into a hot summer sleep , thinking drowsily , as consciousness faded , how nice it was to lie on the couch in your mother 's house , far behind the lines , faithfully guarded by the lone sentry in the tropic heat of the empty parking lot . . . .  |p195Strolling  up the leafy walk to the administration building withher textbooks under her arm , she felt as though nothing hadever happened , no season 's change ( except for the phonylookingpalm trees and the sharp brightness in the air , it mightas well have been summer in New Jersey all over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit or custom , no motion across a continent . But the trip , Betsy thought , howwill I ever drive it from my mind ?  --  not with drugs or drinkingor confessions in a darkened room ; and the sunny silliness ofthis campus only intensified the memory of what she had195p196brought on herself by insisting , over her parents ' horrified objections , on her right to travel from New York to California on a stinking coach crowded with soldiers and sailors . " I have an appointment , " she said to the girl at the first desk , " to see Mrs  --  " " You 're Betsy Felton , are n't you ? Mrs. Muggridge will see you as soon as she 's through . " The girl indicated a substantial woman with carefully permanent-waved blue hair who was speaking into a telephone at a desk by the open casement window . " You can sit in that chair right by her desk . " One look at the Sorority Director 's blue hair was enough . The woman glanced up briefly and turned on an automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare that she hoped was insolent and rude . More time wasted , diddling around with a stupid woman who had nothing more to do with the higher learning than the man who ran the power mower outside her window  --  less , in fact : he at least was smoothing the path , but she was nothing more than a wellcorsetedroadblock . What would she say if she knew ? Would her plump fingers flutter and her waxed mouth drop open if I could find words to describe the reality of the nightmare ? Betsy almost giggled as she thought of how it would be to lift the lid for this creature and give her a whiff of the true sulphur and the scorching smoke . . . . Wrapped in her own itching blanket of restlessness , picking over the shames and humiliations of the last summer like an invalid mulling over a plate of unwanted food , she had ignored the train itself , feeling no relation to the travelers who filled every seat and spilled over into the aisles , not even noticing the soldier seated glumly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , as much as any soldier , was being whirled away from the past , rocketed loose from the old moorings , whatever they were . Everyone close to her  --  all of them were spinning away from one another , flung centrifugally to the ends of the earthp197by the wrenching force of the war : her father from city to city , chasing the glowworms  --  or were they the enemy lights ?  --  of commerce and credit ; her brother Morrow to a combat engineers ' unit in a rocky wasteland she had never heard of before ; Bunty ( who had wanted to marry her for his own reasons but had only succeeded in degrading her ) and his mother to some new temporary refuge , some island where they could await the chancy checks of their legacy , like two castaways mooching along the beach for bottles washed ashore with precious notes inside ; Joe Burley to the mysteries of the officers ' elite and his own astronomical war ; and she herself to the western fringe of the nation where , facing the blue pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real start and proceed to her beloved goal , and her father 's too , just as if there were no convulsions around her and the ocean itself were not boiling with the hot blood of her own generation . Only her meaningless mother was still ensconced in Englewood , a plump raccoon , curled on the couch with only her bonbons to fortify her against the vicissitudes of war . But as darkness fell and sandwiches were taken from paper sacks , sailors began to sing , children began to whine , stray lights speckled the countryside beyond the smoke-obscured windowpanes , and she felt herself coming to rest in the train for the first time , a member of the harried company of pilgrims who would be living with her until the end of the journey . The body took over , as it had to , and she sat stiffly with her eyes glued to the women 's lavatory , watching for her chance to get there at the right moment , when she would not have to stand conspicuously in the aisle before the locked door ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs of the sullen soldier beside her , and when the last call for the diner was announcedby a weary , white-jacketed waiter , she clambered out once again , only to find herself locked in an endless line of snickering sailors who fought for the privilege of ogling her . By the time she was within smelling distance of the diningp198car , faint , hungry , and disgusted , it was too late ; the food was gone ; there was nothing left but the milling mass of whistling , crying , pushing people ; and it had grown so dark that the aisle lights were on . She made her way back to what she already thought of as the refuge of her window seat , and when she arrived in her own car and saw how the soldier was guarding her chair from a disheveled woman carrying a dangling , sobbing child who wanted to sit down and rest , she knew that she was lost , trapped in the seat for days and nights and thousands of miles , free only to scurry from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you , " the soldier said flatly . " That 's a waste of time . I would n't even try . Here . " He passed her a package as she sank down into the seat . " I saved a sandwich for you . " She felt that she was being pathetically grateful , but the dry slices of white bread enclosing the limp slab of cheese plugged the raw hole in her stomach , and the pain disappeared as she gnawed away like an animal . And all he seemed to ask in return was that she listen to him and at least acknowledge his existence . " They travel in Europe like this all the time . In peacetime too . Worse , even . " He stared straight ahead as he spoke , not once looking at her . " I 've never been to Europe , " she said encouragingly . She could not resist adding , " I would have gone there on vacation if it had n't been for the war . " " My father comes from there . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was the point at which she should have stopped ; but maybe it was too late even then , for the mention of his home town , like a magic password , opened the gates , and everything came pouring out . Without touching her , without looking at her , without smiling or laughing , he undid the bandage thatp199was his uniform and exposed to her the sores of loneliness , ignorance , credulity , and hatred of the whole vast mechanism in which he had been caught up , he still did n't understand how . " They stuck me in Camp Shanks , " he said . " I thought I was all set , being in permanent company , and all . " " I bet we 've seen each other around . My home is in Englewood ; that 's not too far down from Shanks . " But he was n't interested in her at all ; he was utterly incurious and even impatient with any interruption in the flow of his misery . " I made T/5 , " he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept my mouth shut , all I was waiting for was my leave . But ' somebody got smart . Now I 'm on my way to the Pacific , I guess . " " That 's a tough break . " " You do n't know . They never should have drafted me . My father needs me home . My mother 's got sclerosis . " " But you got to New York weekends . That was something . " " Nothing to see . Big crowds waiting on line to eat , waiting on line to go to the show . It 's better back home . You 'd think they 'd let you stop on the way ; I had a leave coming . Not them , not the Army . They do n't care if you never get home . " She felt herself blushing for him , for his infantile reaction to his predicament , for his stubborn insistence on never leaving home ( good God , she thought , he ought to be glad , he ought to be grateful to them for yanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a world outside ) , but the lights were already out , they sat with their knees touching in the darkness , and even if he had turned to her  --  which he was too shy , furious , or fanatically self-centered to do  --  he would have been unable to see the expression on her face . At last he was through , run down like a spring-wound toy , and as they rolled westward through the darkness she sensed that he was on the point of tears , but why , why he should want to cry for his father , or Sheboygan , or the unknown Pacific , orp200the fact that he had so quickly spat out his grievances that there was nothing left to complain about , or sheer mindless , objectless self-pity , she could not imagine . Obscurely she was grateful to him ( not just for the sandwich ; tomorrow there would be more , and she knew that when she bought for him he would not refuse or even argue the point ) , but whether it was for talking  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling silent at last , she was not certain . She yawned frankly and turned on her hip . As her head touched his shoulder she said drowsily , " May I ? " " Wait a minute , " he muttered . He reached up to the luggage rack and hauled down a coat , which he flung over them , a common blanket covering them to the neck and hiding their shoeless , twisted disarray completely from the restless , drifting figures who coughed their way to the water cooler and the toilet . She murmured her thanks and shifted against him to a more comfortable position . Lulled by the endless rhythmic clacking of the iron wheels against the iron rails , and by the warmth of his arm , which he had found the courage to wrap around her , she felt herself drifting off to sleep ; but gradually the arm moved , and she came wide awake as his nervous hand began a dutiful exploration of her body . At least it felt dutiful ; it did not approach her with tension or courage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hooks , for an entrance  --  not because of an uncontrollable yearning but only because that was what she expected . But I did n't expect it , she thought in bewilderment . How could he think that that was what I wanted ? " No , " she whispered , twisting about to disengage the soldier 's arm , which had suddenly become  --  now she was sure of it  --  an antagonist 's . But it pressed onward , and she whispered more fiercely , " No ! " With a quick expulsion of breath she broke loose and turned to face the soldier . Before she could open her mouth he had taken her rightIp201hand and pulled it to him underneath the coat . Startled by this affectionate gesture , she relaxed for an instant , and then it was too late . A scream rose in her throat and died before it was born . She jerked back her arm convulsively , but he held her wrist in a clasp that bit to the bone , his nails piercing her skin as though they were knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a new sound  --  it was the soldier , sobbingdryly and brokenly into the collar of his coat . Was it the sobbing that caused her to yield , or the incredible strength of his hand locked around her wrist , stronger and more powerful than her father 's grip in the worst heat of anger  --  or did she actually want , once the first terror had subsided , to caress the hidden flesh that she had never touched or even seen before ? His teeth were in her shoulder now , and his body heaved helplessly beneath her hand . With his fingers no longer on her wrist but only covering her own , she realized with a sudden surge of joy that he was in her power , as completely as if he had thrown himself whimpering at her feet . There was no need for so much as a whisper ; her emotions were in her fingertips ; and she led him , like a practiced whore , to his little death . The revulsion came afterward , when she tiptoed away to wash her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laving the hot water over her hands like a surgeon preparing for an operation , stalling against the unavoidable return to the only empty seat in the car . When she stood over the soldier 's lax , insensate form and began to tremble all over as though the windows were open , a broken series of ill-rememberedquotations from Macbeth came streaming through her mind : Is this a dagger which I see before me , the handle toward my hand ? . . . All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand . . . . She eased herself into the chair beside the poor soul 's huddled body and stared away from him out into the night , not expecting the sleep that she had murdered , and was astonished when she awoke at dawn with the resur/rected soldier bolt upright , already shaved , combed , and curried . But it was as though they were strangers on a train once again . He answered her false comments on the countryside with sullen monosyllables ; he accepted her offer of a picture magazinewith a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play gin rummy . So that 's that , she thought as she stared out the window at the wavering telephone lines ; I have paid him back for the loan of the cheese sandwich with two deviled-egg sandwiches ; we have never even introduced ourselves , and my name would mean no more to him than his serial number to me ; and in California we can touch hands in farewell , neither of us quite certain whether it really happened between New York and Chicago . Yet when night fell and the lights were extinguished , the soldier reached up once again for his coat and draped it over them , precisely as he had done on the first night . And before she could run away or say a single word he had taken her hand once again and placed it on his naked flesh , his face averted even though it was dark , his eyes screwed tightly shut as if he feared that she would try to force them open and make him see what it was that was being done . Dear God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is to say who is the passive one , who is to say whether it 's he or I who accepts the responsiblity ? And it will go on through the night , and tomorrow we will sit , bored and trip-weary , staring out the window , and tomorrow night and the next it will happen all over again , and if we continued to travel it would go on forever , night after night , without any sign of a beginning other than his reaching for the coat , without any signal of an ending ever , because it was as ununderstandable and meaningless as the movements of the planets in their orbits . He moved beneath her touch , grinding his teeth in the darkness , and she knew now that she was lost forever . . . .  |p203Mrs  . Muggridge pronged the telephone gently and said , " Sorry to have kept you waiting . You 're Miss Felton ? " Betsy smiled at her . If you only knew , she thought , if you only knew that it did go on until the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the last morning he muttered his good-by to me with something about thanks for my company  --  mycompany ! " I suppose you 've been giving some thought to the problem of a sorority . " " No , I have n't . " " Your record indicates that you have had some college training . Surely you 've been in contact with the Greek-letter societies  --  atleast been approached by them ? " " Mrs. Muggridge , my knowledge of the Greek alphabet is limited to its use as quantities in trigonometry . " Mrs. Muggridge frowned prettily . " That 's what I 'm here for . You 're in temporary housing now , of course  --  " " I 'm perfectly content where I am. " "  --  but you 're an extremely eligible young lady , if I may say so , and you are probably going to be rushed by a number of sororities . " " That does n't interest me in the slightest . " " I 'm afraid I do n't understand . I have a letter from your father in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says he 's anxious for you to meet some nice Jewish girls , and that  --  " Betsy jumped to her feet . " I wish you 'd allow me to speak for myself , Mrs. Muggridge . I 'm perfectly capable of communicatingwith my father without the help of an intermediary . Is there anything else ? " Betsy was telling the truth ; she was more than content with her room at first ; for a little while she was happier than she had ever been in her life . The chintz and the maple were not what she would have chosen , but the luxury of being alone , ofp204being able to come and go as she pleased , without tiptoeing or making excuses , without having to blot out the sounds from her parents ' bedroom or make conversation with her mother , was so new that it seemed to her a prize beyond value . And her roommate was away so much of the time that it was almost as good as being completely on her own ; the necessity for being in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was a rule , because there was no longer any need for her to be a nightbird , a street prowler , sitting in movies and wandering the streets until everyone was asleep . She could even chuckle , sitting alone at her desk with her math books and the fine little radio that her father 's lawyer had given her for her eighteenth birthday , thinking of the woodenheads in the sorority houses , lying around in their pajamas , eating crackersand cheese and gabbling at one another like so many turkeys . Her father had been disappointed , so he wrote , at her not " hooking up " with a nice bunch of Jewish girls , but the concernsof the war weighed heavily on his shoulders , his movementsbecame so mysterious that he urged her to destroy his letters as soon as she read them , and he was worried about her mother , whose heart could hardly stand the strain of not knowingthe whereabouts of Morrow , engaged in heavy fighting with the combat engineers . He was pleased " as Punch " with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( she had indeed gone there once , as a result of having filled out her registration forms , Religion : Druid , and having been promptly invited thereafter to join the Jewish social organization ; but she had stayed only long enough for hot chocolate , cookies , and Beethoven recordings , oppressed by the hearty atmosphere of good will and good cheer ) , and he seemed to assumethat now she was " finding herself , " going out with cleancutboys from the Foundation and " mixing with the right crowd . " It was only when her roommate settled down to a routine of evenings at home that Betsy really began to take notice ofp205her . Inevitably she despised her . Gloria was a big , plump , jolly girl who was so feminine that she made the room oppressivewith the odor of her presence and , even when she was not there , with her equipment : big boxes of Kotex in the closet ; heavily scented sachet bags that filled the air with lavender every time a bureau drawer was pulled open ; pictures of parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror ; serried ranks of perfume bottles , deodorants , and depilatoriesmarching across the top of the dresser ; stockings dangling wetly from the shower-curtain ring , the drops explodinglike hailstones on the bathtub floor every three seconds ; half-eaten boxes of tidbits shoved furtively under every pillow ; ashtrays choked with red-tipped cigarette butts . . . Gloria majored in sociology . " What is sociology ? " Betsy asked her , and was repaid for her politeness with a strangulated barrage of catchwords  --  human ecology , individual differences , progressive penology , psychiatric social work . . . . To prepare herself for a postwar career as a rehabilitator of battle-weary fighting men , she worked as a USO volunteer , dancing , playing Ping-pong , and toying archly with the servicemen , and occasionallywangling a date when the director was looking the other way . She had a habit of studying on her feet , leaning over an open book with a cigarette in one hand and a piece of peanut brittle in the other . After a while the moons of her broad behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a craving to kick that she had to get up and leave  --  and there she was , forced out on the streets once again , just as she had been at home . But when one of her instructors fortunately invited her to sit in on a meeting of the Mathematics Club , Betsy knew that her isolation was over , and that at last she would have the opportunity to become a star in a galaxy that had always seemed to her almost unattainable and wholly admirable . Intellectuallyshe knew that she was far from ready , but it wasp206impossible to hold off until she could be on a par technically with graduate students and faculty members . In every other way , however , she felt quite assured that she was ready to enter their world . The only other girl who attended meetings regularly was a tall , thin graduate assistant named Amy , a symbolic logician who wore Scotch-brogue walking shoes and a boyish bob , and was interested only in Boolean algebra and cats . It was easy for Betsy to become adopted as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazed with happiness that she almost wrote home to her mother about it , she took to heart her father 's earlier advice : When you 're with people who know more than you do , the smartest thing is to keep your mouth shut . She even worked hard and diligently at her math . Only as she became accustomed to the glory of sitting at the meetings as a kind of candidate for equality , a junior partner in the profession , could she sort out the individual members of the club as people , not simply as mathematicians . She began to understand how it was that even the demigods among them were ambitious and often weak human beings . At the home of the Santiagos , the sparkling South American couple who talked so brilliantly about numbers theory , she was witness to the first breach in the wall of her own faith . She had no business being in the pantry , but there she was when Amerigo , thinking himself unobserved , dipped his finger into the chili bowl , spat out what he tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the face . All evening long they were amiable and indeed loving , but Betsy fancied that she could see the white imprint of the husband 's fingerprints on the woman 's brown , smiling Indian face ; it reminded her too vividly of the morning she had awakened in the hotel room with Bunty , and her father standing outside the door , and of a world she thought she had escaped for good . The second breach came one day when she was invited for a walk by Father Foltz , a handsome and brilliant young Jesuitp207who received some kind of stipend for his work in mathematical physics ; not a faculty member and not enrolled as a graduate student , he led a pleasant life , untroubled by the war , with paper , pencil , books , and ocean bathing ; but there were stories that he had entered the priesthood not for spiritual reasons , but only to be free to play at mathematics . He led her along a sunny cliff overlooking the blue Pacific and chatted pleasantly about her family in New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic quality between moonlight bathing in inland lakes and early-morning wrestling with the ocean waves , about the tragedy of the war beyond the horizon and the future scientists who were being bayoneted to death in the jungles  --  and suddenly he threw his pipe away , threw it in the air so that she could see it tumbling down hundreds of feet to the beach below , and reached out for her with his arms straining the seams of his black jacket . At least he 's well brought up , she thought calmly as she pushed him away , thrusting outward with her elbows and averting her face from the fragrant tobacco aroma ; he does n't simply open his , clerical trousers and grab my hand . . . . " I 'll appreciate it , " he said , panting a little , " if you would n't mention this to anyone . " All she had to say was " Of course , " and they continued their walk as though nothing had happened , except that the black speck of his pipe was visible on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sitting across from her at the next session of the Math Club , she knew , smiling urbanely , looking at her legs just a little , and sucking on a brand-new pipe . The third breach was the most overwhelming because it involvedthe one person whom she had come to regard as a friend in all her months on the campus . His name was Herman , like her father 's , except that he did n't seem to have any other name ; and one night , with no apparent provocation , out of a clear sky , she heard the instructor who had originally invited her to the Math Club turn on him and blurt out , " This country has been pretty good to the refugees , would n't you say , Herman ? "  |p208Herman  had to speak around the cigarette that dangled from the corner of his mouth , as always . He replied in his soft Continentalaccent , scattering a fine spray of ash down his shirt front , " I would be the last person to deny that . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , do n't they ? " " I think that 's true of all people . " " Do n't evade the issue . " Ryerson 's eyes glittered . " I 'm referringto the ones who try to push their way into jobs that people have been working for years to earn . " Herman looked at him expressionlessly . He cocked his head and screwed up his eye against the cigarette smoke . " Some of them come all the way out to the West Coast and dirty up this paradise with their foreign accents , do n't they ? " " I did n't say that . And you ca n't deny what I 've said by making a joke of it . " Betsy could not keep silent any longer . " Surely you were joking ! " She felt her voice rising too high . " Were n't you ? We 're all refugees , are n't we ? " Ryerson laughed shortly . " Maybe that 's the attitude you take back East . We look at things differently out here . One New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need another one in California . " Later , on the way to his room , Herman said to her , " That was a mistake you made . Ryerson wo n't forget your talking back . " " But I 'm  --  " Betsy stopped . She had been on the point of saying , But I 'm Jewish . Instead she said , " I 'm partly Jewish myself . I could n't let him say those things . " " You are , are you ? That 's quite a secret . " Het Ian lit a fresh cigarette from the butt of his old one . " We all live with our secrets . I wondered about yours . " He added sardonically , " A pretty young thing , instead of going out dancing , talks mathematicswith a refugee who stinks from cigarettes . All along I knew there was a reason . "  | " It 's got nothing to do . Why did you say Ryerson wo n't forget ? I always liked him ; he 's always been decent to me until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten grade now if he could . " Herman opened the door of his room and reached in to switch on the light . " But we 'll make sure that he has to give you an A , wo n't we ? " Herman 's was the bleakest room she had ever seen  --  a bed , two chairs , a blackboard with a wipe cloth dangling from a string , three dime-store glass ashtrays stuffed with cigarette ends , and an open valise in the corner , with socks , handerchiefs , and shirts neatly arranged in its pockets . The first time she had gone up to the room she had asked bluntly , " Why do n't you put your clothes away in the bureau ? " Herman had answered gravely , " An old and possibly ridiculous habit . I think it was Molnar who said that the Jew should always live out of his suitcase , so as to be ready for the knock on the door . " She had grown to admire the monastic quality of the room , which went well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He had a kind of assistantship , he corrected papers , filled in with an occasional lecture , proctored examinations , and the like , but otherwise no one knew what he did for money . ) Now he scrubbed vigorously at the blackboard with the cloth , erasing a complex problem on which he must have been working earlier in the day . He took up a piece of chalk and said , " Let 's go over your assignment from Mr. Ryerson . " Betsy worked painstakingly and steadily , with Herman at her elbow nudging her from time to time , until at last he remarked , " You 'll get your A , all right . " She laughed wryly . " But I 'm not a born mathematician , am I ? " " Whatever that means . You 're a very bright girl . But there are too many Ryersons , Betsy . That 's not your perspective , isp210it  --  to join him , to become another Amy , with cats and old journals on the sofa ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then open your eyes . Even if you were tremendously gifted , the prejudices against women are overwhelming . " He blinked at her . " All the prejudices are . Quite irrational , particularly for scientists , but there you are . Take the case of Ryerson  --  an amiable fellow , not the brightest in the world , but essentially goodhearted . Unfortunately the head of the department can not bring himself to believe that Hitler really has designs against the United States . And so Ryerson feels that he must cultivate just such an attitude in order to ingratiate himself with his boss . " " But why was he so vicious to you ? " Herman spat out his tiny cigarette end , picked it out of his lap , and deposited it , still smoldering , in the ashtray . " First , because he hopes that if he says such things often enough he will really believe them and ingratiate himself with his boss . Second , he is desperately anxious for a promotion , which will give him tenure and more money . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby will keep him out of the draft , if the professorship does n't . " He fears  --  we all have fears , do n't we  --  that I am some kind of threat to this ambition . Ridiculous , of course , because I can threaten only myself  --  but he must learn to hate me in order to thrust me aside without any pangs of conscience . That 's why I say he 's basically a decent and stupid fellow . If he were really cruel and clever he would try to shove me out of the academic community without any hesitation , even while he was inviting me up for tea and cookies . " " But if there is an opening  --  " Betsy hesitated , and then swung away from the blackboard , where she had been doodling with the chalk , and faced him , her legs apart and her arms folded . " Why ca n't you have it ? Do n't you want it ? Everybody admits you know more than anyone in the department . " " Do n't you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong , I cannotp211socialize , I have no wife to go to bridge parties with . Already the chairman regrets the charitable impulse which made him invite me out here simply because I had published papers which he admired . I am a living reproach , an embarrassing reminder of a broken and battered Europe . I do n't even cut my hair the right way  --  do n't laugh , there have been hints . " You must mix , they say . But how can I ? I am interested only in mathematics , and for them that is only a way of making a living . They look at me and they see someone thirty-six years old , going bald even though he wears his hair too long , not interested in bridge or movies , and , worst of all , not established , drifting , with no visible means of support , no visible future , only a visible past . Definitely not a good bet for a wide-awake board of trustees . " Do you know something ? " he said abruptly . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my age . A graduate student struggling for preferment , yes . But a man of my years ? I would not have cigarette money if it were not for my mother , who was fortunate enough to obtain employment in an antique shop in London . But all is not lost  --  I have a job offer at a Negro vocational college in the South , teaching calculus . " Betsy 's head began to ache . Her ideas of the scholarly life came , she knew , not so much from the movies , with their cute green campuses and tweedy young professors susceptible to the charms of the sweatered coeds , as from the Book of Knowledge and the biographies she had taken out of the high-school library , which had , she saw now , romanticized the subject in quite another way . And the money-grubbing , the desperate scramble for a buck  --  not to buy more flasks , beakers , or white mice , as the biographies had it , but for motives as sordid as those which animated her father 's early colleagues in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed and rejected as being exceptional and not representative of the society to which she had aspired . The academic community was not a separate world ; she sawp212the connecting cables of self-interest more and more clearly in the weeks that followed . It was not that she sensed a common ancestry shared by Herman and her father , totally dissimilar as they were otherwise  --  although perhaps somewhere in the dim European past there had been loyalties uniting their grandparentsin a tradition which now lingered only as a source of misery to her father because it was so much at variance with his daily life . No , that was not it . Rather it was that all of them  --  not just the Hermans , but the Ryersons , the Burleys , the Traynors , everyoneshe knew  --  were caught up in the same rat race , trapped in the same one-way , dead-end street . Their ambitions , if they were anything more than the combat soldier 's ambition to stay alive , were as streamlined as falling teardrops , and no matter how they prettied them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were all unworthy of her best hopes . So what was the point , she asked Herman more than once , of throwing yourself into the whole competitive sucker-trap , if in the end , or even along the way , it turned out to be as ignoble as the cheapest petty racketeering activity , in which you would never invest your ideals ? " Because in your own mind , " Herman explained softly , " it is always different from the actuality . If what you say were always true everywhere , life would be intolerable . We would have "  --  he smiled around his drooping cigarette  --  " mass waves of suicides among the intellectuals . There would be no achievementsof any kind to light us along the way , because the gifted ones would be nauseated , they would throw up their hands before they had given themselves the opportunity to create anything of value . " " It 's practically that way now , " Betsy replied stubbornly , and was gratified to see Herman 's long , thin face crease into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , " he said , and she was shamed at the sudden opening of a door on suffering the extent of which she could barely conceive . She knew then that the chasm was toop213vast between her own almost baseless adolescent pessimism and Herman 's profound acceptance of the world , surpassing both pessimism and optimism , and admitting the ugliness of reality ( was n't he the one who had exposed it for her , more than those who for reasons of their own had really worked at opening her eyes ? ) without being overwhelmed by it . Nevertheless there were moments when , observing the meannessof the jockeying among the people with whom she lived ( she learned , among many other things , that Santiago had not slapped his wife 's face merely because of the chili , but because their ferocious rivalry included the question of whose name should come first in their joint publications ) , Betsy was tempted to do more than mock at it : she wanted to kick the whole thing aside and move on to something that would engage her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clawing was less furtive , was out in the open as an essential part of the whole business . It was only Herman to whom she could unburden herself , and only Herman who showed her , by precept and by example , that the other worlds were surely no better and probably not as good , that there was time for her to enter them when she chose , and that what mattered was the work itself . " We have to separate the act , " he said , " from the people engaged in it . If you want to use mathematics to address the Society , to browbeat students eventually , to be pointed at as a successful woman , you can do that in any branch of knowledge . Or you can join the WAC and become a major ! But what you should want is the pure pleasure that comes from working on the problem itself . Everything else is paltry . " Watching him live his own advice , seeing him humming at the big blackboard as the chalk raced ahead of his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that she admired Herman as she had never admired anyone  --  not her father in his harshest moments of business glory and terrifying triumph , not her brother in his mysterious unyielding sullenness ,  |p214surely  not Bunty in his venomous , befogged complacency . Murmuringto himself at the blackboard , Herman surmounted whatevertorments had washed him ashore and swept him across the country . Unwilling ever to talk of himself or his past , beyond the single reference to his mother and the London antique shop ( Betsy began to understand how agonizingly humiliating it must be to lounge unmolested under Pacific palms while your mother earned her keep , protected against the Nazi bombers only by ancient beams and leaded windows ) , he seemed to have arrived at a point of internal calmness that gave him courage and fortitudeto spare for Betsy too  --  and for others as well , she thought , if only they knew him as she did . There were nights when , trapped with Gloria and the cracklingpeanut brittle , Betsy reviewed the summer with Bunty , and then the long nightmare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the thought that this was the real start . Was she only postponing the descent to the depravity she secretly craved and would eventually welcome , with this lulling interlude of classes , examinations , meaningless occasional dates , and quiet hours with Herman ? Always , however , there was Herman , and the vision he revealed to her of a life that could have meaning despite every pressure , if only the moments that counted were expended in the struggle for truth . The telegram came one day while she was in class . She returned to her room to drop off her books and get a notebook , and found it lying on her pillow , where Gloria must have put it . Betsy picked it up without much curiosity , tore it open , and read : MORROW WOUNDED NOT SERIOUSLY WE HOPE AND PRAY BUT DO N'T KNOW . HE IS GETTING BRONZE STAR FOR HEROISM AND MERITORIOUS SERVICE TO HIS COUNTRY . YOU SHOULD BE PROUD SISTER . PLEASE WRITE MAMA PRONTO . LOVING DADDY . Caught by a breeze from the half-open window that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it slipped from herp215trembling fingers and fluttered to the floor . As she bent over to pick it up Betsy felt the blood rush to her head ; she grew dizzy ; orange spots whirled before her eyes ; and she thought giddily : I 've got a bad heart just like Mama and I never knew it till now , and if Daddy finds out with everything else that 's happening what will he do ?  --  he 'll wrap me up and smother me with bundlesof nothing , like Mama , and now he 'll have nothing else to live for with nobody left to hate or love . She rose , stuffed the telegram into her purse , washed her face with cold water , and ran out to find Herman . Standing irresolutelyat the curb , she glanced at her watch . He would be home now . She hurried on across the street and raced the nine blocks to Herman 's rooming house , running until her chest ached , then trotting the rest of the way . By the time she had clambered up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not with any fake emotion either , she thought  --  and her tongue was sticking to the roof of her mouth . There was no answer to her urgent knock , so she strode in . The room was empty . Betsy could not decide why it suddenly looked so different , aside from the fact that she had never before been in it without Herman . Maybe it was because for the first time the room was so clean that he might have moved away , except that his suitcase still stood in the corner , closed and strapped , however , as it had never been before . The blackboard was wiped clean and was as blank as the wall . The glass ashtrayshad been emptied and rinsed . On the bursting arm of the mohair chair lay an envelope speckled with English stamps , a London postmark , and a censor'sinitials . Betsy could scarcely read the shaky German script , but she saw that the envelope was addressed to Kurt Herman , and as she stood there holding it , splotched as it was with salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame and she was shaken with an embarrassment such as she had not experienced since the morning her father had walked in on her and foundp216her sleeping with nothing on . I 've been calling him by his last name all the time , she thought ; I 've been calling him by his last name as though he were a butler or a chauffeur ! It was worse , even worse , than calling her father by his first name , and it was confusing : they both bore the same name , and it was wrong for them both . . . The landlady was planted in the doorway as though she had grown there . Betsy put the letter down casually . " Do you know when he 'll be back ? " " He never went out . I know ; I 've been in the front room all morning  --  heard you come in too . Did you knock on the bathroom door ? " Betsy shook her head and followed the woman out into the hall . There was no answer to the landlady 's cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open ; I guess he went up to get something . Maybe he ca n't hear us up there . " Betsy hesitated , then followed the woman 's majestic behind slowly and steeply up to the attic . At the head of the stairs a dummy , fully dressed , was dangling by a length of clothesline from the rafters . It started to sway as they reached the top step  --  swung like a pendulum , perhaps from their own panting movements . It was Herman . A thin screaming started someplace . It stopped as soon as Betsy sank her fingers into the soft flesh of the landlady 's upper arm . For some reason Herman had taken off his shoes and placed them neatly at the side of the chair which he had stood on and then kicked over . Fighting back a wave of nausea , Betsy stared at his slowly turning feet in their black cotton socks . There was a hole in the left sock , and his big toe stuck out almost completely , exposing a carelessly cut nail . She wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she could not bring herself to touch it . I would have darned it for him if he had asked me , she thought  --  or did she say it aloud to the sobbing woman at her side ? I would gladly have darned it . .. THE LONG WINTER 217p217Dear Joe ( she wrote ) , I do owe you a letter , I suppose , altho I do n't even know where you are or whether you want to hear from someone who must be by now only a vague part of your past . There is always the temptation to pretty things up , but you know me better than that . I arrived out here in the phoniest state in the union after a dull , completely uneventful ride across the country in what was practically a troop train . No snow or anything resembling honest seasons here . Have you been wondering about my family , about whom you were always so curious ? Morrow was wounded in combat and is now a Big Hero . He had his picture in the paper after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must say , than my pictures did in the days when I was a " social butterfly " in Washington ( which seems like a million years ago ) . I predict he will be a General before the war is over , but he does n't seem to think he 'll live that long . I think he will , just to spite my father . Mama was supposed to have had a calamitous heart attack ( I doubt it ) when she heard her boy was shot in the shoulder and got his hands burned . But it has kept her from visiting me out here , and I am bearing up without Mama as best as I can . Daddy is a Big Wheel . If you see the papers wherever you are , I guess you believe me by now , altho you certainly did n't last summer , did you ? He was out here for a day on some secret business  --  I do n't suppose I should tell you even that much  --  and was delighted to see how well his girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to her studies . Little does he know ! It would be impossible for me to describe to you , even if I could write as well as Ernest Hemingway , the stupidity , the pettiness , and the nastiness of this place . I wo n't waste space telling you about the sorority sisters and the fraternity brothers . They line the campus like wallpaper , and I have nothing in common with them.  |p218There  have been things which have aroused my curiosity , however , principal among them being mathematics . For a while I was the child wonder around here , and I was accepted into the Math Club which is practically all graduate students and faculty people . So it was n't a question of loneliness affecting me , on the contrary , I proved to my satisfaction that I could make it in math , as I believe I told you I was capable of doing . If I wanted to I could go as far as I want , but it has very rapidly lost its flavor . Call me whatever names you like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true motivations . Believe me the people in science in the universities are n't any more noble than the social morons they claim to despise . I am not denying that some of them were nice to me for a while . I did meet one middle-aged man of 36 who was very sympathetic , a refugee named Kurt , but he went off one fine morning and committed suicide just as we were becoming good friends . A fine trick ! Does that make me sound heartless ? I have been trying and trying to figure out why he did it and I have come to the conclusion that I will never know . And I think that 's a sign of maturity , do n't you ? The trouble is that I regarded him with the utmost admiration . But apparently all the while he was being ground down by the world until it became completely unbearable . Or maybe something suddenly happened . What hurts is that I thought we understood each other so well , but when the tragedy occurred I was in the dark . I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at all . He left a note on the blackboard in his room , leaving all his books to me , but I erased it before anyone got there ( could n't bear to have those things as reminders ) . Anyway I began going out a lot , just to keep from being so bored that I would do something drastic too . One night I met a rather attractive Lieutenant in the Naval Reserve who is n't very naval but is very reserved ( that 's some joke , is n't it ? ) and wep219fell in love and I received and accepted a ring from him . Probablythis sounds very callow to you , but he is thirty years old and loves me a great deal . His name is Charles Van Horn and he treats me as though I was made out of glass . That is quite a change from the social morons who can think of nothing but sex day and night . Also from the intelligentsia who claim to be above sex and enjoy probing at your psyche , trying to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean by them . That goes double for the ones that feed you little homilies about realizing your potentialities . I guess I do n't have to go into details about that either . No doubt you are inclined to doubt that this is really love . I can only say that that is your prerogative . My father once suggested that you can live on love for about a day and a half and then you get hungry . However I very coldly came to the conclusionthat it was high time for me to arrange my future sensibly , or I would be the prey to serious forces of unrest . There is something in what my father says about the war ruining people'slives and I do n't want it to happen to mine  --  altho Daddy is going to blow a gasket when he hears about the wedding bells ! Do you know what Charles thinks of me ? He thinks I am the sweetest and most unselfish , most innocent female on record . He insists on calling me " child . " I must confess that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of the conscientious young wife , but since he believes it that is what I will be . I can hear you saying , " So that 's why she suddenly takes the trouble to write me at such length . " You can make of it what you want with your literary powers of observation , but I could n't refrain from giving you this piece of news . So good-by . . . By the time you receive this I will be Betsy Van HornBetsy put down the pen and stared at her signature . It was the first time she had ever written the name that would soon bep220hers , and it gave her a queasy feeling to see it so boldly on the paper . Perhaps she should have practiced it over and over , writing Betsy Van Horn Betsy Van Horn hundreds of times , as schoolgirls did when they dreamed of young men and proposals and marriage . It was a splendid , almost a glittering name  --  but now that it was to be hers she saw that she was no longer eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying on her back , when she heard Gloria 's heavy footsteps in the hall . Quickly she folded it and slipped it beneath her pillow . Maybe I 'll send it and maybe I wo n't , she thought ; maybe I 'll write one that 's more truthful , maybe I 'll write one that 's less truthful ; maybe I 'll grit my teeth and not write anything at all to anyone . . . . As the door swung open she lowered her eyelids and allowed her mouth to go slack . Sleep would not come , but perhaps there would be silence until the need for it was past . The air smells of rotten olives , Morrow thought as he moved restlessly from side to side against the masonry wall on which his back was leaning ; and everything seemed to itch , his feet in the boots that were by now almost a part of his body and curled up at the toes like a policeman 's , his neck from the rasping shave he had subjected it to with cold soapy water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt floor . He drew his knees up to his chin , wrapped his arms around his legs , and cocked his head attentively at Sergeant Mullins , who had dropped to his haunches before him and was paring his nails with a knife as he spoke . " What 's next , Captain ? "  |p221Morrow  looked at him in some annoyance . Mullins was a regular Army man , but in all his ten years of service he had never learned to take things as they came . Why do n't you relax ? Morrow wanted to ask . Instead he said , " We sit here , that 's all . " " We 're exposed as hell . " " It 's an advance post . " He could not keep from adding , " What did you expect , a poured concrete cottage with a bomb shelter in the wine cellar ? " " That 's all right , " Mullins replied stupidly , without indicatingwhat was all right , " but they know we 're here . " He gesturedout the sagging window at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know they know it . " Morrow glanced out the window at the barren , eroded hill . At the beginning of the slope were scrub , twisted honeysuckle , a few poplars , and some miserable olive trees , but the elevation itself was quite bleak , wrinkled with vertical gullies and speckled with small boulders . His men were deployed as thinly as possible in the scrub and the olive groves from east to west ; directly overhead , looking down at them from the child 's mitten of white cloud that dangled over the brow of the hill , were the Germans . " Probably dug in up to their shoulders , and with hot and cold running water too , " Mullins went on persistently . " When they get good and ready they can shove us right back into the crick . What 's to stop them ? " " Your guess is as good as mine , but I think the colonel will send us some plow jockeys from the repple depot , throw in some artillery cover as a big favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mullins stared at him . " He could n't do that . " Morrow shrugged and nodded at the radioman . " Ask him ; he 'll know before I do . " Mullins rose and moved slowly away , knife in hand , mulling it over in his mind , true to his name , but no matter how hep222mulled , it would have to come out the same way ; and that was fortunate , because he would spread the word around . For a while , no one else would ask , " What 's next , Captain ? " All of them were happy to have come this far , to be alive and for the moment unthreatened , smoking , eating , picking their noses , without the cold sweat of fear sliming their fingers . They slouched about as Morrow did , turning their socks inside out , digging at their K rations , writing endless letters , arguing . The arguments were not debates , but competitions in which voices vied with one another in an effort to achieve extremes of statement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaders of the CIO , Frank Sinatra , or Tony Martin ; as the need for release of pent-up hatreds became intensified , the discussions centered on the question of whether the enemies at home should be castrated with rusty razor blades or flung from B-29s withoutparachutes . As it was with hatreds , so it was with enthusiasms , and now that the advance of the Russians had kicked open the closed door of the future , even the chronic skeptics who suspected that the war would go on forever had to hold still while the enthusiastspulled the Russians forward to the English Channel and dismissed the necessity for an invasion of Western Europe . Inevitably , with the war won for them while they squatted on the floor of an unknown peasant 's cottage three thousand miles from home , their talk turned to the bright dreams of peace and their own individual futures . It was a subject that Morrow dreaded , particularly now , because he knew , not that the war would go on forever , but that many of them could not possibly survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporal , a Pole from Buffalo , who was not going to be a hearth man at Republic Steel any more but was going to open his own motorcycle repair shop , who took the initiative of bringing Morrow into the conversation . In a sharp , bold , accentedvoice he asked , " Wadda you gon na do when you get home , Captain ? "  | " When I get home ? " The very idea was fantastic . He looked around at the men leaning against the whitewashed walls ; not one of them , with the exception of Mullins , had been away from home as long as he , and in every face there was written the dream of returning and picking up the threads that had been dropped . Were there any of them who , like himself , had n't dropped any ? " I 'm going to live on my Social Security , " he said . " If I can still hobble around , I 'm going to sit on a park bench like Baruch and watch the kids play tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them a little uneasily . But the corporal pressed on . " Wudya do before the war , Captain ? " " I was in the food business . Just before I joined the Army I was working on processing K rations . My boss was trying to get a government contract , and we had a bunch of chemists with years of experience in blending canned dog food . They did n't have much imagination , though . All they could think of was soybeans and horsemeat , and we could n't afford to use meat at all . We never did get the contract , so do n't blame me for what you 're eating . " That was all right too , it made a good gag , but no one would ever know with what passion he had thrown himself into that ridiculous business . And how quickly he had forgotten it ! One week in camp and it was as though the door had closed behind him forever on all the old life . But the pattern had been set . A few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot gloom of an office too much like the one he had left behind , had been enough to send him into a black frenzy of boredom  --  and of hatred for his father , who must have been responsible for his assignment to Desk 575 and its heap of pink triplicates . He looked for an opportunity to bring it all crashing down , and it was easy : an empty warehouse that he could stock with Maritime Service linens and blankets bought from drunken ships ' officers , contacts with Arab traders , and he was in businessagain like his father , and with just as good prospects ofp224making a killing  --  until they caught up with him , as they had to . He had n't really wanted the money , he had n't really wanted the power that went with it ; in fact , he did n't know what he wanted , any more than these kids with their talk of motorcycle shops , girl friends who worked in candy stores , extension courses , and chrome-trimmed automobiles . Everything I ever did was negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father or to show him that I could do anything as well as he , that I could be a hero too  --  everything except the day when I jumped up on the burning tank , without even thinking of him , and opened the buckled can with a wrench in order to let out the crew that was roasting inside ; and if there 'd been time to think of my father then I would n't have done it , I never would have seared all the meat off my hands , not for a million medals . He rubbed his palms together absently ( ever since they had healed they had made a soft rasping noise when you rubbed them together , like two pieces of fine emery cloth ) , recalling suddenly the expression on his father 's face when he had had his bar mitzvah in that synagogue in the Bronx whose name he could n't even remember now . He could remember everything else , though : Betsy , aged nine , sitting with Mama in the women 's balcony , swinging her legs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light from the stained-glass window ; and Dad , sitting primly below him in a dark blue suit , with a look of pride , triumph , and deprecation . What a pious fraud ! Morrow had been an excellent Hebrew student . Learning his maftir had been so much fun that he found it hard to understand the other boys ' hating it and using every possible excuse to get away from the rebbe and out to Van Cortlandt Park . As a matter of fact he had learned so quickly and so well that when the big Saturday morning came around he mounted the bimeh , luxuriant in his Palestinian yarmulke embroidered in gold thread , and his magnificently braided taleth , and delivered his little speech of gratitude to parents and rabbi in a confidentp225Hebrew that brought murmurs of delight and appreciation from the congregation . What was more important , he had discovered that , at thirteen , he knew more than his father . They told him he was enteringmanhood ; even his father had to concede it , because it was so written ( although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; but even though he had suspected that his father 's piousness , like his philosophizing about business  --  which Morrow realized later was cribbed from the columns of Arthur Brisbane and Roger Babson  --  was false and hypocritical , it came as a shock to know that he himself could prove at least that his father 's ponderous showing off of his religious knowledgewas that of an essentially ignorant man . It was then that he must have decided to become a rabbi , as soon as he knew that the rabbinate would put him once and for all beyond his father 's reach . The period of religious intoxicationhad gone on for six months , with enough fussiness about ritual and dogma to set even his mother 's teeth on edge , with his little sister staring at him in bewilderment as he wound his phylacteries and turned his face to the wall . At its peak he had pleaded to be transferred from James Monroe High to a Torahtrueyeshiva in preparation for his future rabbinical studies ; and then it had stopped , stopped so completely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke , the eternal reference to the days when Morrow actually fasted like a saint and swore that he was going to be a rabbi . Why ? He had never really thought about it , any more than you think of the color or pattern of a suit that you have outgrown , but it seemed obvious to him now that it was not just a quirk of adolescence , like a romance with a girl who , encounteredyears later , seems utterly ordinary and unexciting , but an emotional response to his father 's demand for unquestioning recognition ; and as soon as his father indicated that he was willing for him to go ahead with his dream of becoming a man of God , the whole basis for his response was destroyed and hep226turned back , first to baseball , then to girls . Had his father really foreseen what would happen ? Was he shrewd enough to realize that the quickest way to free Morrow from the infatuation with an idea which to the rest of the family meant only the Sabbath candles was by pretending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  much more likely  --  did his own clinging to the forms , if not the core , of the ancient faith put him in such an awkward position that he could not declare his opposition to this impractical ambition without at the same time exposing his own hypocrisy , so that he had to acquiesce in an abhorrent decision which meant the death of his material ambitions for his son ? Whatever the case , he had put the quietus on the whole thing as effectively as if he had gone to a child psychologist for professional advice , and as a result he had forced Morrow into a more subterranean form of opposition . Morrow adopted a surfaceagreeableness that was part of the war and yet could only disarm his father , coupled with an underground struggle that was quiet , relentless , and unremitting , as he finished high school and went meekly off to business college like a repentant boy led away to reform school . For he hated his father ; he never hid it from himself , although he behaved correctly and rarely gave cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was not a fool ) became aware of the hatred and was furious in his helplessness to counter it , even though he did his best to thrust his moneyed fist at the draft board and the Army in an effort to reassert his parental omnipotence . Once Morrow , proud of his sister 's looks and eager to establishsome common ground between them , or perhaps  --  so it seemed to him now  --  simply casting about in his loneliness for support in the long-drawn-out guerrilla battle , had attempted to take her into his confidence , to reveal to her the roots of his feelings and the reasonable basis ( for she prided herself , even as an adolescent , on her passionate devotion to what she thought of as reality , as opposed to the idealism of religion or any abstractideas ) for his hatred of their father . Only once , but neverp227again . After that they had been flung even farther apart , not just by physical distance but by the polar extremes of their feelings about their father ; and inevitably they lapsed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother-sister relationship that only widened the gulf between them , so inappropriate and foreign was it to their natures . For no sooner had he attempted to tell her what Herman Feltonwas really like , as a prelude to an explanation of his determination to undermine their father , than she had flown into a wildly irrational rage , and he discovered that Betsy adored their father , she worshiped him , and whatever reservations she had as to his completeness and perfection she wanted to consider in solitude , if not to suppress entirely . All the little-girlish daughterlytricks , jumping on Daddy 's lap , bringing him his evening paper like a puppy , ruffling his hair and then carefully combing it  --  these were n't simply stunts she had picked up at the movies but real expressions of a devotion and awe that she had no other legitimate means of expressing . Still he tried , spurred on doggedly by the fear that Betsy would be drowned in a sea of adoration and admiration for just those character traits to which she should have been most hostile . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and before plunging into the subway for the ride up to the Bronx he had treated her to a soda at Loft 's . " Do n't you see , " he said , watching her greedily suck up the dregs of the lemon extract through ' parti-colored straws , " that he himself is a victim of the whole setup ? He thinks he 's different , he dreams about becoming a millionaire , but he 'll never get to be a big shot , even on Seventh Avenue . Those days are gone . " " You 're the one that 's the victim . You think you 're so old and wise just because you go to college , but the trouble with you is that you 're jealous of Daddy . I never heard of a son being jealous of his father before , but that 's what you are . " She was proud of her audacity.  | " It has nothing to do with me , " he replied patiently . " You 're illogical . I could be jealous and still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about him , the cheap conniving and the petty chiseling , all the little garment-center tricks that you think are so cute . If he was successful , if he was rich , at least there would be some excuse . But all he 's doing is dragging us down , trying to get us to admire him and imitate him , and you 're fallingfor it . By the time you finish high school you wo n't be anything more than a weak imitation of your old man . " " Do n't kid yourself , " Betsy said wisely . She extended her leg outside the table and scratched her calf thoughtfully . " I 'm not going to be anybody 's imitation . I 'm not going to be stuck in the Bronx all my life , Morrow , bet you any money . The difference between you and me is that I believe in Daddy  --  he 's not going to be stuck where he is forever , either . He 's not just going to drift , he 's going to take charge , watch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had both been right , of course , it was easy to see it now , and they had both been wrong . Naturally Herman Felton could n't make it during the bad years before the war ; his talents were n't of that order , aside from the fact that you had to have money to make money in a depression . But as soon as the defenseprogram started he was ready ; it went like magic , all the doors opened up , and he walked in and took charge , as Betsy had foreseen . It did n't make any difference whether she had actually foreseen it , even as a particularly shrewd adolescent , or whether the accidents of history and Adolf Hitler ( as their father put it ) had conspired to justify her faith : what counted was that she had seen for herself how the threadbare slogans and tattered banners with which Herman Felton went into battle still had enough meaning to throw him up to dizzying heights , a little industrial Napoleon come from nowhere , whose fantastic success in itself justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new dodges by which you insinuated yourself into the seat of power.  |p229And  in that sense he had been right , for his sister , whatever her dreams of escape from the Bronx and the entire atmosphere of mother , school , and friends to which she rightly felt herself to be superior , had been hypnotized by the success that took place before her very eyes . Dances in Washington and socializing with the wartime elite became an essential part of her own reality , so that no matter how boldly she grappled with the problems it posed for her , no matter how seriously she tried to penetrate the roots of their common situation , she was trapped inside the magic circle herself , the real victim of her father 's desperate yearning for power , unable to stand outside and view it disenchantedly . A shadow fell across his feet . It was Lieutenant O'Reilly , who had been out on patrol . " Hello , Jimmy , " Morrow said . " How does it look ? " " I think they 're getting ready to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman in Philadelphia ; like Morrow himself ( if for different reasons ) , he had gone charging like a bull to enlist in the Army , and he had got his commission the hard way , in the field . He was an excellent officer , although a little unimaginative . He wanted reassurance now , and he was entitled to it . But what was there to say ? " I do n't want you to think I 'm just sitting here on my ass . " " I did n't say  --  " " I told the colonel how it is . " Morrow shrugged . " He thinks he 's still back in Pontiac , leading the potato-sack race at the annual company picnic . I made it as clear as I could ; I explained that it 's untenable ; but he 's stubborn . That 's why he sent us across the creek in the first place . It wo n't straighten out the line , I do n't have to tell you that . " " It does n't make sense . There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the water . Oley says it 's going to be bright and clear tonight . Bright and clear . You know what that means . He never steered me wrong yet . " " I know . I 'm waiting for the colonel . God knows what he'sp230waiting for . Believe me , I 'd love to get out of here . Look , take six guys from here and send back the six that have been out the longest . They can get the burrs out of their hair while I 'm waiting to hear . It wo n't be long . The colonel 's got to get off the pot soon . " " Okay . " As he swung around to watch O'Reilly striding off into the brush , followed by the grumbling men he had selected , Morrow felt a crackle inside his shirt . It was Betsy 's latest letter , postmarkedSan Diego , still unopened . When did I get it ? he thought wearily . Was it yesterday ? The day before ? It was before they had gone out to ford the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had neither the time  --  at first  --  nor later the inclination to open it and read what she had to say . Not even now , he thought as he smoothed out the envelope and withdrew his hand ; what can she tell me ? It had been useless , ever since his failure on that Saturday afternoon so long ago . The disparity in age between them had diminished in importance , but that had n't really done any good because as Betsy had left adolescence behind she had gone on to a new series of adventures , which seemed to him merely reflexes of her situation as Herman Felton 's daughter ; her friendships and her enthusiasmsstruck him as being at the same time out of proportion and picayune . On her part , she was unable to understand why he should resent his father 's sending him to the Wharton School , or endeavoring to use his power ( which became increasingly real and less a figment of his imagination : an extension of his omnipotence from the tiny realm of their Bronx apartment to a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just by his immediate family but by newspapermen and legislators who did n't even know him ) as a lever to provide for his son 's preferment in the military world . " Let him , " she had said . " I would . It does n't bind you to anything . What difference does it make whether he wants to do it because he loves you or because he wants to prove what he can do ? "  |p231But  that was just it . She was clever enough to see through to the heart of the matter , but incapable of making the moral distinctionthat would be the inevitable next step for almost anyone else . What was the point of bearing a grudge , he thought wearily , just because she could n't be bothered or was actually unable to make the effort to understand him ? He was willing to do it for her , it was true ; his heart bled for her in her wretchedness , trying to be the incomparable Betsy Felton of her dreams and Daddy 's little girl all at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no use in his writing her that he was sorry for her , sending a letter from a place where he was probably going to die , to an ocean resort where she thought perhaps that she was even happy , and surely that he was crazy for worrying about her . And yet there had been one moment when he thought that maybe the pummeling of reality ( not what she thought of as reality , but the actual world that Herman Felton had never outlinedto her and that would sooner or later break her heart ) was pounding her into his corner , where they could embrace as brother and sister before they were both destroyed , and not merely nod to each other as they took their separate paths to perdition . The moment had come in the form of a nicely sardonicletter from her after she had heard about the Bronze Star . He had lain on his North African hospital bed , holding the letter in the boxing-glove-like bandages that covered his hands , staring at her precise , tiny handwriting and thinking how she was changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to fresh influences , might yet divert her from the fatal descent . There was no gush in the letter , no girlish sisterly pride in her big brother 's exploits ; instead a wry , almost a little too hard , dissection of how the folks at home reacted to the news that Morrow Felton was a hero : how Gelbhorn , Herman 's accountant-accomplice , had rushed servilely to see that it got into the papers ; how Ruby Scharf the lawyer had sent her ap232carefully composed letter explaining why she should be proud of her brother ; how Mama had taken to her bed , with just about the best excuse she had ever had , sharing her son 's wounds ; and even how Daddy , yes , her precious Daddy , made good and sure to derive the maximum benefit from his son 's immolation by fire . Of course it was difficult to know how much of it all was factual , since she too was thousands of miles away from the home front , but what delighted him was the tone she adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary importance ( although that was good ) , but of an individual looking at the show with her own eyes and her own mind . Behind it all , however , was an underlying note of sadness , of time lost and opportunities thrown away , about which she was vague but nevertheless insistent . Was she envious ? Did she actuallyyearn for the male prerogative of being shot , burned , and reduced to a broken jumble of shattered bones and sizzling flesh ? It was n't impossible , despite her bravely cynical front , and between the lines was still her sense of urgency to do the dramaticthing , to be great or heroic  --  like her father . Life was all but intolerable where she was , that was clear ; she seemed to be drifting in a boat without oars , drawn toward the brink not just by the prevailing winds but by some internal current that swung her steadily toward a point where no one would ever be able to reach her again . Obliquely she was asking for help for the first time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dictating a reply to the Red Cross girl who sat pleasantly at his bedside , pen in hand , he found it impossible to be more than clever and reassuring , and politely concerned with her troubles at the university . It was n't enough . Weeks passed before he heard from her again ; he was hobbling about , flexing his hands , and learning that the skin that had been transplanted from his thighs made a sandpapery noise when he rubbed his palms together ; he opened her letter with his own hands and saw at once that she had reverted to mere recital of her surface calender . The recital it/self was enough to indicate that her fiery dreams of academic glory had been reduced to cinders , burned out with astonishing swiftness , and that she was turning to another expedient , marriage to a mediocre man , a time-saving device to give her a chance to catch her breath and gather her forces for another assault on the impenetrable fortress . There was nothing he could say in reply . Nevertheless , he thought , those weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , certainly of that great part of it in which he had been in the Army  --  not just in retrospect , when all of the past , even the gloom-filled adolescent evenings and the deadly dull college days ( cost accounting , personnel practices , public relations ) took on a false glamour , full of yearning and sentimentality ; but at the time itself he was aware of the fact that he was happy and content to be nursed , to be fed , to lie back and look out the window at the palm trees rattledby a dry wind , to listen to the cries of the Arab children in the streets , to watch , pleased but without desire , the marine rollingof the nurses ' broad white hips as they sailed gracefully down the long aisles . Even the pony magazines were fun to read . Weightless , withoutadvertising , without any relation to the life that he now knew , they seemed like exotic messengers from a land he no longer recognized . He was reading the little overseas New Yorker one day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her semi-literate Negro maid , when he felt someone standing before him at the foot of the bed . He put down the magazine and saw a stocky , freckled lieutenantstaring at him with a peculiar intentness  --  not rudely , but with a startled expression , as though he had unexpectedly come upon someone he knew . " Are n't you Morrow Felton ? " The unmilitary form of the greeting sounded so old-fashioned that Morrow sat upright , disarmed and delighted . " That 's me . " " My name is Joe Burley . I knew your sister quite well back home . "  | " Oh yes ! She wrote me about you more than once . " " Funny how quickly I spotted you . Of course I 've seen your picture on your mantel back home , and Betsy keeps a snapshot of you in her wallet . " That was something he had n't known , and he wondered at once how Burley had seen the inside of Betsy 's wallet . It bespokean intimacy , not vulgarly put but nonetheless real , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't help but guess immediately that Burley had been physically intimate with his sister . Yet he was surprised to find that he did n't feel resentful or suspicious toward him now that he was standing here . " What brings you here ? " he asked . " Were n't you supposed to be going into chemical warfare ? Is n't that what Betsy wrote me ? " " Thank God that did n't last long . " Burley smiled cheerfully . " I 'd never have gotten through the physics course they said I had to have if it had n't been for Betsy  --  and then it did n't make any difference after all . I used to be a reporter , you know . Not long after basic I got a break , and they assigned me to Yank . That 's why I 'm here , on assignment . " " I bet you like it . " " Could n't ask for more . " He sat down on the edge of the bed . " I should be feeling embarrassed now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy , got up like a soldier in the movies even though I do n't know one end of a BAR from the other ; and here you are , banged up to hell and gone , and probably getting ready for more as soon as they put you together again . But you know something ? I do n't feel embarrassed at all . I just feel lucky as hell . " They both started to laugh then , so loudly and gaily that two of the other men in the ward woke up and looked across at him enviously . After that they talked together like old friends . They spoke a good deal of Betsy , of the strange summer at Benedict , and even somewhat of Herman Felton ; and while they skirted the real issues , tiptoeing around them skillfully like feinting boxers , jabbing now and then at the heart of the matter , there could have been no question in the mind of either of them , Morrow thought , but that they understood each other , and each knew how the other felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it was time for Joe to leave  --  and they were aware of how slight the chances were that they would ever meet again  --  they said their good-bys with a reluctance that approached genuinesadness . For the first time since he had joined the Army Morrow began to understand how it was that grown men suffered from loneliness . Joe said , with his first indication of embarrassment , " Is it permitted to shake hands ? " " I need the practice , " Morrow replied as he extended his arm . " But I ought to warn you , you 'll be shaking hands with part of my right buttock . " So they pressed hands on a final note of gay good humor , not really saying good-by or even lying that they would write to each other , but vaguely agreeing that they might try to keep in touch through Betsy . Not long after , Morrow was dressed up , exercised , thumped , and sent back into the line to see if he could be finished off this time . Now he squatted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never heard of or cared about before . From here on to the bitter end there could be no novelty , no future , only a repetition of the things that had already happened , repeating themselves once again in an intricate variety of patterns of tracer bullets , groans in the night , stale curses , exhortations , and sweat-soaked weariness . He heard his name being called and looked up to see the radioman motioning to him . " It 's the colonel . " Morrow brushed himself off and got to his feet . Walking quickly forward , he found himself rubbing his hands together inp236his newly acquired gesture ; but it was unnecessary , he thought as he picked up the phones , because sweat no longer formed on the new flesh of his palms . " Captain Felton , " he said briskly . " Listen , " Tompkins said without preliminary . " Alert your men and give them a good briefing . I want you to move ahead to the new position at twenty-three-fifteen hours tonight . Weather says you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to secure it before dawn , because I need prisoners and information real bad . The element of surprise is essential , since we 'll be moving up behind you afterward . I 'm going to go after Hill Seven-o-three  --  consult your maps  --  and you 've got to take this one first . " " Surprise ? " Morrow said . " You want us to go up there withoutartillery ? " " There 's no time to move it up . You wo n't need it anyway , not if you flank them from three sides . They 're fagged ; I believe they 'll crack and run . " All over Italy the armies were standing still , but the colonel had no time . " Colonel , " he said , " how about reinforcements ? I have n't got enough men for a good neighborhood fight , much less  --  " " I do n't want to argue about it . There 's nobody available here . Tell the men I 'll have them pulled back after the position is secured . That ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bright and clear tonight . " " Weather says  --  " " I do n't care what Weather says ! " Morrow cried boldly . " If it 's prisoners you want , I 'll go up myself . I 'll get a couple volunteers for a recon patrol , and we 'll bring back your information about Seven-O-Three  --  or at least we 'll try . But I ca n't lead them all up there ; they wo n't have a prayer . " " Captain Felton , " Tompkins said querulously , " do n't you understand that I 'm giving you an order ? " Fuck you , Colonel , he wanted to shout . Fuck you , Colonel !  |p237Behind  him the men in the room were utterly silent . He said desperately , " There is n't a boulder on the whole slope big enough to stick your ass behind . Do you want to wipe out the whole outfit ? " " I issued an order . I want to know if you 're going to carry it out . " It might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner for the newspaper or face the consequences . Always he had said yes . It was a yes that had baffled and infuriated his father , who had recognized not only that it was wholeheartedly insincere but also that it deprived him of the opportunity ( for which he hungered ) of unleashing thunderbolts and proving his parental authority . Now , however , to say yes would be to confer the highest possible boon on his father , it would make him the father of a dead hero instead of a live coward ; it would warm the colonel 's foolish heart , which yearned for a star before it was too late , and for the glory that shone on generals who sent men to their deaths ; it would resolve his own dilemmas once and for all by putting an end to them . To say yes now would satisfy everyone  --  everyone but the men who stood waiting behind him . " No , " he said , " I wo n't . " As he waited for the colonel 's reply it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war  --  the mess in North Africa and the abortive court martial , the newsreel heroicswith the flaming tank , and now this  --  he had been only a puppet on a string , tricked into the delusion that he was kicking out of his own free will , but actually only responding to tugs made years and years ago . Whether he acquiesced or objected , he was only trying to please or to injure his father ; and how could you account for madness like Colonel Tompkins ' without knowing what flaming hoops his father had once compelled him to jump through ? After the long silence ( he could hear the breathing of every man in the room behind him ) , the colonel said calmly , " Felton , I 'm relieving you as of now . You 'll be turned over to the provostp238marshal and shipped back to the stockade for court martial . That clear ? " Morrow exhaled . " Yes sir . " " Now get me that Irishman , your lieutenant . Put him on pronto . " He turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Mullins . " Jay , " he said , " go on out and dig up the lieutenant . Tell him the colonel is waiting for him . " The frightened men made way for him in respectful silence , falling back as if he were the chief mourner at his father 's funeraland they had come to pay respects . When he had resumed his place against the wall , some of them took tentative steps toward him , as if to extend their condolences , but hesitated , either because they could not find words or because they did not want to intrude on his grief . He lifted his head and said , " I 'm out of it now . You 'll get your orders from Lieutenant O'Reilly . " They began to talk then , not to him but anxiously among themselves , sensing that he had made the decision to be left alone . He was alone at last ; he would never be more alone in his whole long life . What more could he have done than offer to go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a line had to be drawn , someone had to accept the responsibility of explaining to the colonel that this was n't the picnic grove in Pontiac , that he was n't just making a big score that would bring him to the attention of the board of directors . He had done it , and that was all . O'Reilly came in , breathing hard . He stumbled over the doorsillin his haste and looked inquiringly at Morrow , who jerked his thumb at the radioman . As soon as he saw O'Reilly pick up the phones and freeze , his long , sharp face hardening as if it were being cast into a mold , he knew that it was really over , that he had done what all his life had been leading up to , really done it , and now there was only the waiting for what seemed in retrospectinevitable . If you can solve problems by speculating about them , hep239thought , I 'll be able to settle them all before they tie the blindfoldaround my eyes . He reached up to scratch his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now there was time to read it and reflect , to enter her world , now that he had rejectedthis other world . He tore open the edge of the flimsy envelope carefully and smoothed out the onionskin sheets on the top of his knee . Dear Morrow ( he read ) , Now that I am an old married woman it occurs to me that perhaps you would like to know something about my husband and my happy married life . I have lots of time for letter writing now , since Charles has been given sea duty and is aboard an aircraft carrier someplace in the Pacific . He is a lieutenant ! senior grade in charge of recreational facilities ( probably spends his time counting badminton sets , I suspect ) and says that if I keep my fingers crossed he may make lieutenant commander before this is over . I tried to explain to him once that it will never be over but he was quite horrified , so I dropped it . Charles is vaguely Jewish , in case you were worried , old rabbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from getting the thing annulled  --  altho sometimes I could think of worse ideas . If you 've been wondering about the name Van Horn ( which I like , do n't you ) it 's because his ancestors came from Amsterdam or someplace like that . But they 've been living in New York for hundreds of years . He went to the Ethical Culture School in Manhattan and once tried to explain it to me , but seeing that I could n't whip up any enthusiasm about it he dropped the subject . He is also enthusiastic about tennis , which he plays very well , good enuf to beat you easily , and he looks very handsome in tennis shorts . He went to Williams College , and he worked for an old established insurance firm on William Street before he joined the Navy , which he thinks is a funny coincidence . I do n't know how long that can go on being amusing , but he thinks it is.  |p240If  you want to know what Charles is like , I can only add that he collects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movies , persists in calling me " child " ( which is what his parents called me too the day I met them ) , writes me ten-page letters about the ocean sunsets and his duties aboard ship , changed the beneficiary of his GI insurance from his mother to me after much soul-searching , and sent me a present from Honolulu of some colored seashells strung on thread for bracelet and necklacetogether with a picture of himself and naval friends standing in front of a hamburger stand in Waikiki . Oh yes , and the only liquor he drinks is a glass of sherry , before dinner . They have n't got any of that out where he is , so I guess he 's on the wagon for the duration . Some sacrifice . As for his parents , the less said the better . His father is a lawyer , does n't seem to work at it , though , and his mother carriesaround a scrapbook with pictures of her flower arrangements . I sent Daddy a snapshot of me at the wheel of the Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have assuaged his outraged feelings , and I think he 's becoming reconciled . Incidentally , I learned how to drive in 3 days fiat , took no lessons , just watched people and off I went . My hobby now is collecting tickets , and it looks like I 'll have a collection to rival Chas . ' stamps before long . I sweet-talked my way out of a couple for speeding , but otherwise I do n't pay them , just save them for Charles , with the exception of once when they hauled me in on a DD charge simply because I 'd had a couple of rum coolers and they smelled my breath . And now , if you can contain yourself I must tell you about my glamorous life here on the shores of the bright Pacific . I am trapped in a kind of high-class government project with a bunch of Navy wives named Aggie and Maggie and Susie and Toni etc ad nauseam . They think of me as just another one named Betsy . And for all they know I am . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get dressed up to go to the dentist 's , orp241shopping , or to the beauty parlor ( God knows what for ) . I am the youngest one , some of them have children , disgusting children , and when they 're not feeling sorry for themselves , which is almost perennially , they feel sorry for my youth . That 's a laugh  --  if I knew how to laugh any more . They play bridge and canasta , which I despise , and some of them make anti-Semitic remarks in my presence , not realizing since my name is Van Horn , and blame the war on the Jews . I could even forgive that kind of pettiness if they did anything useful with their lives , but as far as they 're concerned their lives came to a stop when their precious husbands went away . They have no interests , no ideals , do n't care about anything except getting their silly husbands back into bed with them . I hate to sound vulgar , Morrow , but believe me these creaturesare obsessed with sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck-driver 's ears turn red . The most disgusting part of it to me is that not one of them has the guts to do anything about it . If it really means so much to them you 'd think they 'd get up off their broad bottoms and get themselves other men  --  I know that 's what I 'd do . But I suggested that to one of them the other day and she looked at me as though I was telling her to poison her kids  --  which would n't be a bad idea either . In fact , they have me typed as a queer one because I do n't sit around and sniffle about Charles . A couple months of this and you feel like you 're being slowly strangled . For a while I watched the want ads , having nothing better to do than sit in the sun on a deck chair and try to shut my ears to their stupid stupid talk . I thought perhaps I would get a job , but frankly I ca n't see the point of just taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you ? I do n't really want to do something that simply anyone can do , just for the sake of being busy or patriotic . But I do want to break out of the shell and grab hold before it 's too late for anything . Of course there is the alternative of going home to Mama , which would be jumping from one living death to another . Daddyp242points out that it may be a long time before Charles returns , and while he understands that I may feel it my duty to be waiting for him at his home port , he thinks that Charles would ( or should ) understand how important it is for me to be in a wholesomeenvironment . Is n't that something ? You know how I hate to lie , but I had to write and explain that even if Charles ' ship only comes in for a day or two , I would never forgive myself if I was n't here . You ca n't retrace your footsteps  --  I feel that very deeply . I can only assure you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way loose from these cretins if I have to set the buildingon fire or drive the Plymouth through the lobby . So do n't be too surprised if you read something funny about your discontentedsister in Stars &; Stripes . And in the meantime try not to get killed . I know you . You proved you were a hero once already , that ought to be enuf. love and stuff , BetsyPS Oh yes , almost forgot about the enclosed . It comes from my close reading of the papers . As soon as I saw the name of the legal eagle I guessed that our parent must be involved in some way . He 's more secretive than ever . Do you think this is why ? ? ? At least he 's living and doing things ! ! Morrow shook out the pages of the letter , but could find nothing . Puzzled , he retrieved the envelope from his side and blew it apart ; a small clipping was wedged in the far corner . He pulled it out and read : Washington , April 27  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of defective equipment to the military services , tampering with government inspectors , featherbedding and hoarding of labor under cost-plus contracts , and manipulation of records of contractrenegotiation proceedings already under way in certain industries . An early witness was Reuben Scharf , well-known New York corporation lawyer . Smiling and affable , Mr. Scharf had no comment as he left Committee chambers for the NationalAirport . Staff members of the Committee 's counsel asserted that there was no implication of wrongdoing on the part of any of Mr. Scharf 's clients , but that they merely wanted " clarification " of certain points on which additional testimony will be taken " in the near future . " After folding Betsy 's letter neatly , Morrow slipped the clipping between the pages and inserted them into the envelope . As he looked up he saw O'Reilly put down the phones as gingerly as though he were handling a grenade with a defective pin . He was very red in the face , he looked like he 'd been drinking too much , and as he crossed the room the freckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull , dark , and discolored . He stood before Morrow and cleared his throat . " Why 'd you do it ? " Morrow took Betsy 's letter and put it inside his shirt . " I could n't go through with it . Let him come up here and do the dirty work himself . " " That 's what he 's going to do . He says I 'm in command ; I 'm responsible for you till he gets here . I told him there 's no place for you to go , but he says  --  you 're my prisoner . " " All right , Jimmy . " Morrow arose . " The best hope for all of us is that he 'll drop dead from excitement on his way here . Otherwise we 're in for it . You 'd better tell the men . " 244 OUT WENT THE CANDLEp244Sitting in the dark launch , churning away from the Battery at twelve o'clock at night with his Gladstone between his knees , . Herman knew that soon there would be time enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even for regrets about this trip into the teeth of the war , perhaps  --  more time than he had had for years . But now , seated beside the purser , . the radio operator , and the captain , who had just returned from the convoy conference , he was still carried along by the momentumof the last few days , with their frantic preparations and last-minute good-bys to Clara , to Gelbhorn , to Scharf , and to all the rest . He had seen Scharf last , and his lawyer , even after the shots , the passport , and the wild rush of wirepulling that had finally got him passage on the Liberty ship and made it impossible for him to change his mind , had begged him not to go . It was the first time that he had ever seen Scharf on the verge of losing control . The lawyer 's white hair was rumpled , and as they walked down lower Broadway he stopped in front of TrinityChurch with his homburg clasped in his hand and grasped one of the iron railings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though without it he would have collapsed . A little old Christer encased in a sandwich board that bore a hand-letteredBible quotation was jigging around on the sidewalk . He cried out in a surprisingly young , strong , and urgent voice , " Repent the lost days and the evil thereof ! Join the army of the Lord ! " " What 's the matter , Ruby ? " Herman asked . " Are we walking too fast ? " " I wo n't be responsible for what happens if you go . Rememberthat , Herman . "  | " You wo n't let me forget . " " I 'm serious . It is n't just how it will look . That 's bad enough , but the hell with it . They 're in too far to quit , and you know you ca n't buy them off ; they 're going to come around asking questions , and that secretary of yours is going to sit there telling them that you 've gone abroad on important business . The longer you 're gone the more questions they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once I could n't get a seat on a plane . Too many people would be involved . " Scharf passed his hand through his hair and glared at the shabby , strident little missionary . " We 've got to work like hell in the next few weeks to set things right . There 's a lot I can do , but I need your signature , and you 've got to be here to straighten out your board members . You ca n't hold those goddamnedrelatives in line by long distance . " " There 's nothing I can do any more until I get back . " " It 'll be too late then . The congressman is cracking , do n't you realize what that means ? Ca n't I get that through your head ? " " Kindly take it easy , Ruby . This is my son that 's involved , not some stranger . He 's been fighting Hitler for us . The least I can do  --  " " The least you can do for him is not to let things go smash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could even have phoned London . " " I did already . It 's not enough . Come on , Ruby , I 'll be late . " The Bible thumper shouted after them , " I 'm happy ! I 'm a happy man ever since the day I found Christ Jesus ! You can be happy too ! " That had been only a few hours ago , but already it was a part of the irrevocable past . The captain sat silently swaying beside him , his hands locked across his fat belly , ignoring the salt spray that splashed their faces ; on his other side the purser and the radio operator , both sounding a little drunk , were laughing together over a private joke . It hardly seemed possiblep246that they would find the right ship , lurching around the harbor in the pitch dark like this . The launch wove around crazily , now picking up a looming shape , now discarding it as it proved to be the wrong ship  --  although how they could tell was beyond him , since they all looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with their nameboards , high on the bridge , reversed so that they could n't be read . But at last they found the J. Pierpont Morgan , just as Hermanwas beginning to feel a little sick . They clambered straight up the side on the Jacob 's ladder , and the purser , a goodnaturedyoung fellow whose face was covered with acne , handed Herman 's bag up for him . On deck the captain belched and said to the purser , " Ernie , take Mr. Felton to the lieutenant 's cabin . He 'll bunk in with him . " The lieutenant was the Naval armed guard officer , a grammarschoolteacher from Queens named Gorski , who told Herman all about himself in the first five minutes and was disappointed when Herman said only , " Do you know when we sail , Lieu-tenant ? " Gorski shook his head . " Nobody knows that . Do you hear those noises coming from the radio shack ? Sparks is listening for the code signal . As soon as he hears it we 'll hoist anchor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way at four o'clock in the morning , by the luminous dial on Herman 's watch . As he lay in the lower bunk ( Gorski had graciously ceded it to him , vaulting into the upper with his shorts flapping about his hairy thighs to show how little it meant to him ) , staring up at the varnished wood of the upper bunk inches above his face like the inner lid of a coffin , and listening to the wild sputter from the radio room and the boweldeepthrobbing of the ship 's engines , he knew at last that he had really done it , he had dropped everything as he could never conceivably have done only a month ago , and he had thrown away everything that he had been slaving for . For Scharf wasp247right , there was no question about it ; if he ever got back it would be too late to put things right . He had n't exactly told the truth when he explained to Scharf that too many people would have had to be involved in his getting a ride on a bomber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon had said that he 'd have to wait a week , possibly even two , for free space . The prospect of staying in New York or Washington all that time seemed too agonizing to contemplate , even though it would have given him and Ruby time to line up their defenses before he left for London . If he had been as much of a machine as people seemed to think , he would have found it impossible to deny that that was the logical thing to do ( once he had decided that he absolutely had to go to London , which would by no means have been certain ) , and therefore he would have done it , coldly and decisively ; he would have worked up to the last minute , flown to England , swung his weight like an ax against the necks of the people who were persecuting his son , and flown back home at once . Well , he could still fly back , but it would be like hurrying to get to a funeral on time  --  and his own funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to spend floundering around in the North Atlantic were a sheer waste ; worse than that , for they could do Morrow no conceivable good and could only insure that things went to smash at home ; but Herman could not explain to a single personin the whole world that that was precisely why he had embarked on this quixotic voyage  --  to do penance , to share the suffering that Hitler had brought to everyone else , to forge a common bond with Morrow so that they could stand together against the tyranny of imposed authority . The funny thing was , in those first few days at sea , that both the sailors and the ship 's officers were impressed and frightened by his presence , his expensive cigars , his anonymous insignia-less khakis , and his air of authority . Not knowing how else to behave , they all deferred to him  --  from Gorski and the chief engineerdown to the messman who served him in the saloon  --                   @ @ @
