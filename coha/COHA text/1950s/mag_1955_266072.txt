In the course of weapons-testing , it was inevitable that the U.S. Army sooner or later would pit its prized Nike ( rhymes with Mikey ) antiaircraft guided missile against the Air Force 's pet Martin Matador jet bomber missile , an " uninhabited " ' aircraft . The Nike-Matador aerial duel was held at White Sands Proving Grounds , N.Mex. this fall-and it promptly set off a ground war between Army and Air Force pressagents . <P> Although results of the Nike-Matador match were officially classified as secret , the Army lost no time in leaking the news that Nike had blasted the jet-powered Matador from the sky . The Air Force was prompt with a reply . Four Nikes , said the airmen , had been fired at a Matador , and every one of them had missed . <P> Wrhat actually happened at White Sands confirmed both the Army and the Air Force versions-in part . The Nike-Matador test was held in two phases , about a week apart . The first time , the Matador flew a prearranged course at less than 40,000 ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700 m.p.h . In four attempts to bring Matador down , Nike failed . The Army checked its weapon and found that some of Nike 's guidance instruments were out of kilter , a fact that the Army attributed to " personnel error . " <P> The guidance instruments were reset , and the second phase of the test was held . At least two Matadors were flown . They were destroyed by Nikes that searched them out . <P> Then began the battle of the press-agents , in which the Army last week got in the last word , for what it was worth . It said that the Air Force itself plans to use Nike to protect some of its strategic bomber bases . However silly the argument may have seemed , there was a reason for it : the Defense Department was in the last stages of carving out its budget for fiscal 1957 and both services were seeking a larger cut of the melon for their own weapons development programs .                 @ @ @ @
