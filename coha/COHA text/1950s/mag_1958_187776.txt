The Family Reunion ( by T. S. Eliot ) opened a season at the off-Broadway Phoenix Theater that will consist of works by Nobel prizewinners . Though written 19 years ago , The Family Reunion has , perhaps with reason , never before been professionally staged in the U.S. It is difficult to stage , since both the inwardness of its drama and the trickiness of its dramaturgy are difficult to project . Yet the play is worth producing , however serious its shortcomings . For it more than endeavors ; it experiments . And it not only has a certain academic interest where it fails , but where it succeeds it is close to unique . <P> Eliot , after completing Murder in the Cathedral , was determined to write a verse play with a contemporary theme and a contemporary setting . The drawing-room setting he contrived was not only fitted for traditional moments of comedy , it made for eerie moments of contrast . The nobleman hero 's return to his family , to confess to his own guilty crime while absent and then to smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood , is charged with ominous Aeschylean echoes . The Greek Furies themselves still hunt the criminal down , until he is able to convert an Orestes-like fleeing from doom into a Christian pursuit of salvation . Against this search for light are placed things blind and self-centered in contemporary life-a mother 's passionate willfulness , a smug family 's hush-hush gentility . <P> Eliot himself , one of his play 's harshest critics , has deplored its not fusing Greek story with modern one , its exalting " versification at the expense of plot and character . " And all too often The Family Reunion seems remote just where it should be intense , seems to be abstraction without even the vividness of allegory . Bloodless , it fails to cut quite to the bone ; it is only those inwardly dead in the play who ever seem outwardly alive . <P> But though never really dramatic , The Family Reunion can become suddenly theatrical ; its Chorus of Uncles and Aunts , although too selfconscious , can be amusing or striking ; the atmosphere can quiver with menace ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rigid . Stuart Vaughan 's sound staging and Norris Houghton 's shapely set make for helpfully stylized effects , although a cast that includes Florence Reed , Lillian Gish and Fritz Weaver tends to act in varying styles . The cast , understandably , come off best where Eliot did-with the language .
