txt Letters to The Times CARL VINSON , ALFRED LACHS.JOHN F. KENNEDY , M.C. LANGDON P. MARVIN Jr. , CHARLES ... Letters to_the The Times New Marine Corps Bill Subsidies to : Airlines Objections to House Version Believed Answered in Committee Report To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMER ! I read with great interest Hanson Baldwin 's article in the July 2 TIMES on our version of the Marine Corps Bill . It seems to me that the objections made to the House proposal are answered pretty well in the committee report on the bill . On making the Commandant a member of the Joint ' Chiefs instead of a " consultant , " I would like to bring out these additional thoughts : General Collins testified that if ' the Senate version should carry it would not , in his opinion , modify anything that has heretofore been done in respect to consulting the Commandant . In the form passed by the Senate , General Collins said , the bill merely stated the existing circumstances . Future Friction Moreover , the Senate bill ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the determination of when and whether the Commandant should , be consulted . As to who would notify the Commandant , when he would be notified , etc. , the bill was entirely silent ; and this situation would as sure as anything have resulted in endless friction in the future . Also , the Commandant was given J. C. S. rights that even the permanent members do not have  --  the right of appeal to the Secretary of Defense and to the President . Even General Cates testified against that . General Cates also pointed out to the committee that under the Senate language he would have to be a " silent member "  --  and what he did not say is that unless he is made a permanent member , he being unwanted by the other members of the J. C. S. , he would not only have to be silent most of the time but it would be an extremely uncomfortable , embarrassing situation , hardly conducive to harmonious work by the J. C. S. I have not the slightest doubt that the decision had to be this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the J. C. S. with no more and no less right than the other members or he ought to be left off entirely . The latter course is bad , in my judgment , for many reasons , some of which are summarized in the report . This left only the decision to put him on the J. C. S. One further thought : The Marine Corps can be separated from the Naval Establishment only by act of Congress . General Cates himself testified firmly against such a separation . The committee is unanimously opposed to it . There is absolutely no question of that in this legislation right now , and there is simply no danger of that happening in the future . The Congress would not be party to it . Law Queried But it is ridiculous to tie Marine strength to Navy strength , as we have done by law for the past thirteen years . We should never have done it in the first place . I think we ought to consider the Marines as the nation 's ground-air shock troops for military actions short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army ; they have traditionally done it ; and , in fact , they have spent a good part of their history doing remarkably well the initial and most difficult chores in wartime , which chores would have been the Army 's had there been no Marine Corps . If they are kept in condition to do this in the future  --  and they will be called upon to do it no matter what condition they are kept in , as events throughout our history have shown  --  then we will have enfranchised the Army and Air Force so they can concentrate freely on their primary missions to be reasonably prepared for the all-out war if that should come . I think we have a sound approach to the problem . CARL , VINSON , Chairman , Committee on Armed Services . Washington , July 3 , 1951 . Vandalism in the Bronx To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES% You reported recently on the vandalism committed by teen-agers in the Battery Tunnel , where newly installed hghts were smashed and great damage done . Mr. Cashmore , Borough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have never seen , in my twenty-five years of public service , a more destructive piece of vandalism . " Evidently Mr. Cashmore has not been in the Bronx . For a number of years business men and manufacturers in the neighborhood of Third Avenue have been victimized almost daily . Window-smashing has reached the point where surely records are set . A few months ago , in one night alone , sixty windows were broken in our plant , last week another twenty . Across the street , in another building , thirtyfive windows were smashed , and next door to that , eight were broken . Big store windows in our section have frequently been shattered , premises burglarized , merchandise willfully destroyed . The police are doing their best , but are powerless to stop this vandalism , they are so undermanned . Even if the delinquent le caught , which often happens , the police complain about the lack of cooperation from parents and the juvenile court . If parents get the complaints they often become abusive and threaten the policemen with retaliation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disagreeable outlet for juvenile energy , treating it as a nuisance . Thus the delinquent gets away easily . How long can business men put up with this ? ALFRED LACHEL New York , July 10 , 1051 , Civil Aeronautics Board Criticized fog Handling of Problem To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK TWEE t AS long-time advocatesof legisla. tion for effective subsidy'separation , we were amazed to read in the July 10 TIMES a story  --  put out by the Civil Aeronautics Board  --  headlined " Hidden Subsidies to Airlines Ended . " These headlines inspired by the Civil Aeronautics Board are very mislead . ing . Actually the Civil Aeronautics Board has not solved the separation problem at all . The C. A. B. story seems designed principally to take the heat off itself generated by the sizzling report released July 10 by Senator Sparkman 's Small Business Committee , calling for subsidy separation . The C. A. B. story seems designed to mislead the taxpayers , who are asking more and moreil " How much subsidy to the airlines is hidden in the $125,000,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. A. B. outlined in its letter of July 9 to the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee is no solution at all . 1 . Instead of setting a mail rate on the basis of cost of service rendered , as called for by the President and the Hoover Commission , the C. A. B. has set a rate on the basis of what , by their own admission , " the big four ear . riers have agreed to accept . " The rate they have agreed to accept-45 cents per ton mile  --  still includes within that rate a great deal of subsidy . Basis of Competition This can not be corrected until legislation is passed which will provide that ompensation be based on the cost of service rendered and not what happens to be mutually agreeable to the C. A. B , and some of the big airlines . 2 . The " solution " put out by the C. A. B. applies to only ; our of the fifty airline carriers in the United States now receiving the $125,000,000 per year airmail pay , and does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least half of the mail subsidy . Therefore , until the subsidy separation applies to United States international airlines the C. A. B. solution is very incomplete compared to the recommendations of President Truman and the Hoover Commission . 3 . The C. A. B. 's " administrative separation " does not provide for separate and open appropriations for airline subsidies as recommended by the President and the Hoover Commission and THE NEW YORK TIMES editorials of Aug. 3 , 1949 ; April 10 , 1950 ; May 4 , 1950 ; July 29 , 1950 , and Nov. 19 , 1950 , and by failing to do so denies the taxpayer the opportunity to approve or disapprove these hidden subsidies . The subsidy separation plan proposed by the C. A. B. does not do the job that needs vitally to be done , and by misleading the public into thinking that the problem has been solved lessens greatly the chalices for enactment of legislation by the Congress that is necessary if this reform is to become a reality .

Washington , July 10 , 1951 . Rights of Our Citizens To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMM Corliss Lamont 's letter in THR TIMES of July 5 shows the same concern that Communists have abundant speech and attentive audience that he has always shown . He is wrong in three particulars : ( 1 ) The Smith Act and its approval by the Supreme Court have not " scrapped the Bill of Rights . " ( 2 ) We have not denied citizens " the liberty to say that revolution is justified . " We have not denied any citizen the liberty to say anything he pleases. ( 3 ) There is no parallel between the Smith Act and the Dred Scott decision . The former has caused the American people to breathe in relief and thank God that we have found a way to keep plotters in line . The latter violated the great popular desires . It was Lincoln who , violently abused when he suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But must we uphold this one clause in the Constitution to the point where the entire Constitution goes by the board ? " A little common sense does help . So long as we have the ballot there is no need to protect any mythical right to plot and overthrow . R. W. Rua .
