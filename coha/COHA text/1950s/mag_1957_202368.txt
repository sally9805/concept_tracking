The materials were certainly simple enough-a piece of baling wire , a razor blade , some copper foil . But , explained a distinguished M.I.T. physicist one day last week , they were just about all that any schoolboy would need to build himself a device that could measure the amount of silver deposited in electroplating . In another room in M.I.T. 's sprawling Building 2 , a colleague toyed with a tray of marbles to demonstrate molecular action . Near by , another scientist was making a telescope out of cheap lenses , curtain rings , a cardboard cylinder , and some pieces of hose from a truck radiator . <P> These activities were a good deal more than ingenious doodling . They were an important part of a multimillion-dollar project that may radically revise the teaching of high-school physics . <P> Out of the Past . Sponsored by the National Science Foundation , the M.I.T. program is the most ambitious ever undertaken to modernize high-school physical science courses . Its steering committee includes such names as Nobel Prizewinners Edward Purcell and I. I. ( for Isidor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atomic Scientist Vannevar Bush and Moviemaker Frank Capra ; its working staff already numbers more than 100 . Under Director Jerrold Zacharias , head of M.I.T. 's nuclear science laboratory , the staff will work at least five years on the project , after that may turn its attention to high-school chemistry . <P> One reason high-school physics courses are often so bad , says Zacharias , is that their textbooks are largely based on physics as it was known 50 years ago . Though new knowledge is added in revised editions , it is merely tacked onto basic material that is still out of date . The books overemphasize practical applications , concentrate on macrophysics , such as Archimedes ' principle , to the neglect of microphysics , which has become all-important with increased knowledge of the atom . By fall , Zacharias hopes to have ready the first part of an experimental textbook that will concentrate on basic laws and include the major discoveries of the last few years . For especially interested students , Laura Fermi , widow of the Nobel Prizewinner , is editing a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , the project will turn out scores of films that alone will cost $2 million . <P> A Snap &; a Taillight . The baling-wire-and-razor experiments are part of a do-it-yourself program intended to find ways to contrive laboratory equipment from cheap and available materials . The doo-dlers have already produced a strobe unit -a simple optical device for cutting up motion into a series of split-second visual pictures-out of two tongue depressors , the flat top of a tin can , a woman 's dress snap and a piece of baling wire . A way of demonstrating wave mechanics was developed by shining an automobile taillight through a window frame of agitated water and thus projecting the wave motions on a paper screen .
