The President 's daily schedule of appointments is usually pretty dull : a conveyor belt of officials and politicians who pass through his office at intervals between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. and dump their problems and requests on his desk . One day last week President Eisenhower got a welcome surprise when Lynda Widerberg , a pretty blonde in a soft blue organdy dress , walked into his office and announced , " I was going to kiss you . " <P> Ike was delighted . " Well , why do n't you ? " he shot back . And with that he picked up three-year-old Lynda and kissed her . Then , beaming , he turned to greet Lynda 's sister and brothers , her mother and her father , Willard Widerberg , 34 , a seventh-grade teacher from De Kalb , Ill. , who had just been named " Teacher of the Year " by the U.S. Office of Education and McCall 's magazine . <P> " I Got a Medal . " A moment later the photographers crowded into the office and posed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture-taking Ike suddenly slipped his shell-rimmed glasses over the nose of Gregory Widerberg , 6 . Greg blinked in surprise . After the pictures , the President went behind his great desk and beckoned to the kids in his best grandfatherly manner . " Come on around here , " he said , rummaging through the desk drawers , " and we 'll see if I have n't got something for you . " As the children gathered around him , Ike fished out two quarters and two dimes , tried to divide them among the four children . But Lynda was too quick , scooped the two dimes from the desk . <P> Then Ike found a small penknife . He glanced at the older Widerbergs , got an approving nod , and gave it to Will . For Dawn the President inscribed a photograph . A small gold-cornered notebook made a fine souvenir for Greg , and , as an added prize , the President found a silver dollar for Lynda . " Oh , Momniie , " she said , " I got a medal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver dollar , exclaimed to reporters , " Ai n't I lucky ? " <P> " I Was Astonished . " The children 's hour was the President 's only public respite in a busy week . One day he faced a restive press conference , ran into a barrage of questions about the Army-McCarthy hearings and his executive order barring testimony on the now famous meeting of Jan. 21 ( see below ) . Said the President : " I have no intention whatsoever of relaxing or rescinding the order because it is a very moderate and proper statement of the division of powers between the Executive and the Legislative . Now when I saw in the paper allegations to the effect that the issuance of that order could be used as a reason or excuse for calling off hearings , I was astonished . " <P> The Jan. 21 meeting had been called , he continued , because the Army " had to have advice . That was the purpose of that meeting . . . Now the only reason I issued the order was because I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long sidetrack established . . . that had no possible connection with this investigation . Far from me trying to get any investigation off the track , I was merely trying with the timely statement to keep it on the rails ... I want to see this thing settled conclusively ... let the chips fall where they may . "
