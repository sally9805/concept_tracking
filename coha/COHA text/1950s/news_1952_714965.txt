Early in the morning , weary troops of the Republic of Korea ( R. 0 . K. ) Ninth Division crawled up the slopes again toward the bitterly contested summit , from which they had been thrown again last night by a vicious Chinese Red surprise ' attack . One Chinese company was holding the crest , and front line reports indicated the Communists had moved . two divisions into the immediate area  --  a total of perhaps 16,000 men . Later , a regiment of the South Koreans flipped around the flanks of " White Horse " and attacked another hill mass farther north . There , at latest reports , this R. 0 . K. unit was hotly engaged with the Communists . This second hill  --  about as high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enemy assembly point for attacks down the Chorwon corridor . The enemy seemed determined to take and hold " White Horse Hill , " scene of the heaviest fight ing in Korea for a year . From Monday through Thursday , in this effort , the Communists are estimated to have suffered at least 3,500 casualties . Storm Hides Fighting The South Korean soldiers crept forward during the morning through rain and mist that blotted out the hill from a distant view . At last reports the R. 0 . K. 's advance guard was within 100 yards of the crest ; but communications were often cut and the weather blanked out air observation . At dawn the Chinese Reds ' artillery and mortar fire on the slopes held by United Nations troops was reported increasing . Near the " White Horse " crest , the South Koreans fought the Communists hand to hand in shellholes that seamed the hill . The troops in some spots were so mixed together the men judged by the feel whether a neighbor was friend or enemy . The Chinese crop their hair short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain and darkness on the hill , the reports said , a man faced death by the kind of haircut he had . Along most of the rest of the front , fighting dwindled to patrol actions . The savage attacks the Chinese Communists had launched Monday all.along the United Nations outpost line seemed definitely stopped . Minor clashes occurred northwest of Yonchon on the western front and north of the " Punchbowl " in the east , without appreciable change in positions . West of the " White Horse " region , Eighth Army troops held . the " Big Nori " height west-northwest of Yonchon against a series of Chinese probing attacks that began at 2:40 A. M. yesterday . The Allied advance unit , headquarters said , withdrew slightly during the morning to reorganize and pick up reinforcements and regained control of the hill an hour later . The rains grounded the INIGhunting F-86 Sabre jets . Other United Nations planes concen- , trated on close-support missions around " White Horse " Hill .

The total of 7,528 Red casualties was the highest for a month since November , 1951 ; and the bitterness of the fighting was underlined by , the ratio of dead to wounded . The period included only the first two days of the Comniunists ' drive that opened Monday . The fighting for " White Horse " picked up at dawn yesterday after the South Korean Ninth Division men had seized the summit before 2 A. M. A Red battalion ' attack drove them off . The R. 0 . K. 's clung grimly to the reverse slopes . Allied planes with bombs and napalm and Allied tanks with direct:fire guns cut into the Chinese . R. 0 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill " caught three Chinese Red companies moving to reinforce at " White Horse " and it was estimated this inflicted 200 to 300 casualties . At 1 P. M. , the R. 0 . K. 's charged again and in a fight with bayonets and grenades threw the Communists off the crest and back down the northern slope to the original enemy positions along the Yokkok River . It looked then like an R. 0 . K. victory and the Eighth Army said the South Koreans " completely " held the hill . The R. 0 . K. Ninth Division commander , Maj. Gen. Kim Chong Oh , whose men have battled almost continuously for a week , predicted further fighting , however . " The Chinese know , as I know , that whoever controls White Horse Mountain controls Chorwon Valley , " General Kim said . " That is the enemy 's real objective . " The Chinese have lost much face because we have beaten them back . Their general must be very angry . He will not stop trying until he has used up everything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red battalion , in a surprise attack with little artillery preparation , drove back up the slope , and threw the R. 0 . K. 's back to the southern base of the hill  --  the deepest penetration the enemy had made to date of the United Nations positions in this sector . After midnight the South Koreans began the grim process of working their way tip again .
