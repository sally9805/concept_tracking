Chain Lightning ( Warner ) opens Hollywood 's cycle on jet aviation with a great rush of supersonic hot air . Its jets fly much faster ( 1,400 m.p.h. ) , higher ( 90,000 feet ) and longer ( four hours plus ) than any jet-propelled fighter yet announced by the U.S. Air Force . With Humphrey Bogart as a devil-may-care test pilot , its heroics are built to scale . <P> As the picture would have it , Manufacturer Raymond Massey 's experimental wonder , the JA-3 , will soon be outmoded by a model with a detachable escape cockpit . Bogart falls in with Massey 's greedy plans to publicize the JA3 into acceptance by the Air Force . Having risked his neck for money to fly the plane from Nome to Washington by way of the North Pole , a reformed Bogart risks it again for ideals . He tests the new model against orders and sets the Air Force straight . <P> Tough-Guy Bogart still conveys emotion by baring his teeth in a grimace that gentler folks reserve for the moment after biting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries a torch , Eleanor Parker conveys no emotion at all . Much of the dialogue they speak does not deserve to travel at the speed of sound . To its credit , Chain Lightning uses expert photographic effects to wring plenty of excitement out of its flying sequences , suggests that a good movie is waiting to be made about jet aviation . <P> Paid in Full ( Hal Wallis ; Paramount ) is a smoothly produced , competently played tearjerker about a self-sacrificing woman ( Lizabeth Scott ) who suffers &; suffers . Having accidentally killed the only child that her sister ( Diana Lynn ) can have , she marries her brother-in-law ( Robert Cummings ) when his divorce comes through . Then , knowing that she must die in childbirth , she bears him a baby , leaves him to remarry her sister so that they can raise the child as a substitute for their own . The film comes from a story originally published in Reader 's Digest . It is the kind of story that can be heard on the radio any afternoon . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Willie went marching off , the little town of Punxsutawney gave him a sendoff worthy of its first citizen to enlist in World War II . When Willie 's troop train stopped in Punxsutawney one month later , the town gave him a welcome fit for a man on his way to war . But when the Army bogged him down at a nearby airfield while all his buddies went overseas , the neighbors began cutting him , his father wanted him out of sight , and even the dogs barked at him when he slunk through the streets . <P> Willie 's predicament , and his way out , give Director John Ford and some able performers a chance to enrich Hollywood 's current war cycle with what has been missing thus far : comedy and comment . Less cutting and vigorous but still strongly reminiscent of the early Preston ( Hail the Conquering Hero ) Sturges , the movie delightfully sasses Army brass , a small town 's home-front foibles and the windy patriotism of the professional World War 1 veteran .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
