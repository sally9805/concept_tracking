" In less than three years , " said John Foster Dulles , before flying off last week to a gathering of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Canberra , " SEATO has become firmly established and has made a positive contribution to peace and stability . " His words were a little optimistic for an organization whose initials may sound like NATO , but unlike NATO is only a paper pact without an armed force of its own . More impressive than Dulles ' words is the fact of his strenuous trip , meant to show that despite all of the demands of Europe and the Middle East , Asian defense rates high in the U.S. estimation . Just how high can be measured better in figures than in words : Asia has now become far and away the principal field for U.S. overseas aid . Evidence of the dramatic big shift in U.S. spending : <P> Last year Asia got 70% of all U.S. economic and technical aid . Since 1953 , Western Europe 's share of U.S. economic and technical aid has dropped from 66% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia rose from $960 million to $1.14 billion , and total economic and military aid from $1.5 billion to well over $2 billion . In the same budget , only Greece and Turkey among European NATO powers got any economic aid . <P> The young three-year-old republic of South Viet Nam received more U.S. aid in 1956 ( $197 million ) than was spent by France , from U.S. funds , over two years , 1955 and 1956 ( $126 million ) . <P> Three countries-Korea , Formosa and South Viet Nam-got 78% of the $600 million in economic and technical assistance made available to the Far East last year. * <P> In the Asian area from Afghanistan to Burma , a territory that includes more than one-fourth of all the free world 's population , SEATO partner Pakistan got almost 60% ( $108 million ) of U.S. funds . India , whose population is almost five times as large as Pakistan 's , got a U.S. allocation of $60 million in 1956 . One reason for the disparity : neutralist India chooses not to qualify for U.S. military and defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia in recent years is not so much a change of affections as it is a recognition of 1 ) how well Western Europe has recovered , and 2 ) how much the area of imminent danger of Communist penetration shifted to Asia , after the Communists completed their conquest of China in 1949 . <P> Like anyone lavishing money around , and often incurring more ill will among those he disappoints than friendship among those he favors , Uncle Sam finds it hard to get across the notion that aid programs are not certificates of sympathy and merit but barometers of danger , need and opportunity . Cold-war spending is a jumble of crash programs , hard bargaining and erratic generosity . The circumstances which determine who among friends and neutrals gets the most money , however , are not all of U.S. making . Sometimes the degree of a country 's exposure to military and political intrusion by the Communists is not matched by its ability to absorb dollars wisely , or its leaders ' alertness to , or willingness to confront , this peril . <P> <P> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on U.S. aid per capita : Israel $131 , Greece $108 , Austria $104 , The Netherlands $100 , United Kingdom $74 , France $72 , Norway $70 , Formosa $65.
