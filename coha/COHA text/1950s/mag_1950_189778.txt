Peppy Walter Paepcke , 53 , is one of a growing tribe of businessmen who go in for modern art . As board chairman of Chicago 's big Container Corp . of America , Paepcke finds semi-abstract paintings not only enjoyable but also useful-they make eye-catching ads . During World War II , Paepcke ran a series of such full-page magazine ads celebrating the U.N . and , almost incidentally , Container Corp . ' s boxes ( TIME , April 30 , 1945 ) . Afterward he launched a second series on the 48 states , plus four U.S. territories and the District of Columbia . Last week that four-year series came to a close . <P> The commerical theory behind the ads was perfectly clear : boxes are hard to glamorize but well-designed ads may help persuade readers that Container Corp . ' s boxes are well-designed . The problem was to get unhackneyed views of the states from native artists whose work was abstract enough to put design ahead of representation . With the exceptions of some states not rich in native painters , Paepcke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon , he even got a museum-caliber job . <P> Graves had begun badly ; he submitted half a dozen sketches , gave up in despair when they were all rejected , and took off for Hawaii . When the N. W. Ayer &; Son advertising agency , in charge of the series , shipped a bale of Oregon pine boughs after him , Graves used the boughs as subject matter for one last brilliant try . <P> Two of the most abstract paintings in the series were not a bit " modern . " Peter Nielson , who painted Alaska , is a Frog Indian whose work owes everything to his totem-pole-making ancestors . Painter Nielson was pleased to get the job , but explained that as the fish were running it would take him a couple of months to get around to it . In due time he shipped a six-foot-square totemic design , painted on cedar boards , airmail to Chicago . Like Nielson , Hopi Indian Fred Kabotie , who painted Arizona , refused to submit preliminary sketches . He hastened into the desert , shot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hide , and sent it off . The painted hide , complete with head and tail , now hangs in the office where Paepcke is ruminating a new campaign to start next month . <P> The new series will illustrate great quotations from history , supplied by the University of Chicago 's Mortimer Adler ( TIME , April 24 ) . As in the past , Paepcke will get " fine " modern artists to do the job . " When everybody else begins using them , " Paepcke says , " we 'll switch to the standard commercial ones .
