txt MOSCOW , Jan. 2 ? Reversing a trend of recent years , the Soviet Government announced today an increase in the prices of some consumer goods . Automobileprices were raised 25 to 50 per cent , an increase that will affect relatively few Russians . Vodka and wine prices , which will influence the budgets of most Soviet households , increased 10 to 20 per cent . The cost of motorcycles and machine-made carpeting has gone up . Bread prices have been rounded off , generally slightly downward , to save housewives the necessity of carrying odd amounts of kopecks . To soften the blow of the announcement of higher prices , the Government said the cost of some makes of television sets and cameras would be cut . Reasons for Increases There were several reasons for the price increases . Apparently the most important was the necessity for the Government to make up losses in revenue expected as a result of the elimination this year of the compulsory state loan and partial elimination of the socalled childless tax . The childless tax will no longer be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on childless single women or widows . The exemption of these groups , which made up almost 85 per cent of the payers of this tax , will represent a loss in state revenue of 6,000 , - 000,000 rubles ( $1,500,000,000 at the official rate and $600 , - 000,000 at the tourist rate ) . The higher prices imposed by the Soviet Ministry of Trade on vodka and wine should help make up that loss . The Communist party newspaper Pravda // expressed the hope that the higher prices might help in reducing an " excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages . " A half-liter ( about half a quarter ) of good vodka cost 25.90 rubles . It is now 30.60 rubles . A lower grade priced at ' 23.90 rubles now is 26.80 . If the price rise really has an appreciable effect on Soviet drinking habits , the Government will not get the increased revenue it expects . Most observers here assume the Government 's coffers will not suffer any serious shortage . Higher automobile prices will not provide any bonanza for the state because of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passenger car production was 98,000 in 1956 and 55,000 in the first half of . 1957 . Price increases were 10,000 rubles for all models except the small Moskvich . That means the Government will get about 1,000,000,000 rubles for the higher car prices . In an unusually frank admission , the Trade Mini try said it was raising automobile , Motorcycle and carpet prices to help fight against profiteering in those commodities , Higli consumer demand and limited production have given rise to a lively black market . Presumably with a higher official price , black-market prices would rise beyond the reach of many and would also tend to cut down the profits of speculators . The Pobeda , the Soviet Union 's most popular car , a four-cylinder sedan that looks like a 1938 Ford , was priced at 20,000 rubles , It is now 30,000 rubles . At Moscow 's only automobile retail sales outlet there is a list of about 100,000 persons waiting to buy Pobedas . Sales have been running at a rate of eighteen daily . Prices of the Volga , which went into production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Studebaker , were increased to 40,000 rubles from 30,000 . There are about 50,000 persons waiting to buy them in Moscow . The larger Zim was 40,000 rubles and now will be 50,000 . The Moskvich , a miniature car smaller than a Rambler , was not affected by the price changes . A new model has just been put into production priced at 15,000 rubles , compared with 8,000 for an older and smaller Moskvich . The Soviet Government is seeking to reduce the wide gap between demand for automobiles and their supply . It has chosen not to increase production of cars , which doubtless would interfere with items of heavy industry that are more important for the Soviet Union . Its answer has been to raise prices and thereby , it hopes , to reduce demand . In its announcement of the price increases Pravda went to great length to tell the Soviet people how much the Government had been doing for Soviet consumers . It cited wage increases , improved pensions , reduction of work hours , past price cuts and other factors . It said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer goods industries at an increasing rate . Strength of Illegal Trade The increases in Soviet automobile prices represent a Soviet admission of the strength of illegal private trading . Recent Soviet comment has complained that the illegal automobile dealers receive often two or three times the Government price . Thus the higher official prices are intermediate between the old prices and the black-market prices . The Government , which requires cash payment on delivery and has no time-payment plan , presumably hopes that the increased official prices will force many persons to drop out of the waiting lists . - Since the average Soviet worker 's wage is between 700 and 800 rubles a month , cars selling at 15,000 to 30,000 rubles have very small markets .
