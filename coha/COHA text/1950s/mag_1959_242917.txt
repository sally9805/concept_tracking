For years , Soviet economists have inveighed against installment buying as simply another hobnail in the capitalist heel grinding the faces of the poor . When a Western worker lost his job , they declared , he lost his car , his furniture , even the home on which he could no longer keep up payments . Last week , in an unabashed about-face , workers all over Russia were invited to sign up for the installment plan as a wide range of Soviet consumer goods were made available on credit . <P> In Moscow 's mammoth GUM department store a plump , blonde secretary mooned over a Tula portable sewing machine priced at 1,200 rubles , * finally planked down 300 rubles , signed some papers and took it with her . In an Izmailovo radio store a middle-aged man watched the clerk packing an expensive Luxe radio-phonograph and said : " I only had to pay 440 rubles , and we 'll have music in our home this very night . " Whether cameras , clocks , accordions , motor scooters , outboard motors or silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20%-25% down , a service charge of up to 2% , and the rest deducted in six to twelve installments from the worker 's monthly paycheck . <P> For all its novelty , consumer credit caused no traffic jam in the stores . Reason : the hard-to-get goods in greatest demand , such as automobiles , refrigerators and TV sets , were conspicuously missing from the credit list . And lest the Russian shopper think that the consumer millennium is just around the corner , Premier Khrushchev , on his way back to Moscow from Peking , told a Vladivostok audience that the U.S.S.R. has no intention of trying to equal U.S. automobile output . " We will use automobiles more rationally than the Americans do , " he said . " We are going to establish taxi pools , where people can use cars when they need them . Why should a man worry about parking space ? " <P> As even he must have anticipated , Nikita 's taxi-pool plan evoked no display of overwhelming enthusiasm from his subjects . And for all his usual adroitness , Khrushchev dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalist U.S. , " People say : ' This is a lousy car , but at least it is my own . ' " Parking problem or no parking problem , this is a statement that most Russians would clearly like to be able to make . <P> <P> * The ruble 's official exchange rate is four to the dollar , the tourist rate ten to the dollar , and on Russia 's active black market in currency the rate sometimes leaps as high as 100 to 1 .
