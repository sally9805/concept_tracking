D DBy DAVID HOWARTH All over the south of England , on the night of June 5 , 19,1 ? , people awoke and went outside to listen . They had become used to noisy nights . The noise had changed through the past four years , from the distinctive beat of German bombers and the din of air raids , to the sound of British bombers outward bound at dusk and homeward bound at dawn . But people who heard the noise on the fifth of June remember it as different from anything that had ever been heard before . As they listened that night , with increasing excitement and Q. ) 1959 by Do. / How.11 ' 14 pride , they knew that the greatest fleet of aircraft they had ever heard  --  the greatest fleet that anyone had ever heard  --  was passing overhead from north to south . Some exclaimed , " This is it ! " Many heard the sound with such deep emotion that they did not try to speak . It was the invasion , as everybody knew or guessed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defeat of Dunkirk and justify the British refusal to admit defeat . It would he a reward for the four years ' grinding labor by which they had dragged themselves up from the depths of 1940 to a state of national strength . And if it succeeded it would mean the beginning of the end of the sorrow , boredom , pain and frustration in which they had lived so long . That was to be its significance if it succeeded . What if it failed ? People could not bring themselves to imagine what would happen if it failed . But they knew that failure would be a military disaster which at best would take years to retrieve , and in the back of their minds they doubted their ability , exhausted by war as they were , to survive such a disappointment and build everything up anew . They went to sleep that night , if they slept at all , knowing the day would bring news of a battle which would influence all their lives forever more . On the whole , they were thankful the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , they thought anxiously of the thousands of their own people who were on their way to battle , and of the Americans , whom many of them had met for the first time in the past few months . The next morning the main news in the papers and on the radio was still of the fall of Rome , which had been announced the day before . Nothing was said of events nearer home . But just after nine o'clock the bare announcement came : " Under the command of General Eisenhower , Allied naval forces , supported by strong air forces , began landing Allied armies this morning on the coast of France . " Within a few minutes this news was repeated all round the world . My purpose here is to give an impression of what happened in the English Channel and on the coast of France that morning , between the time when the aircraft were heard over England and the time when the news was released . To make the impression clear , one must start with a summary of eighteen months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasoning which decided when and where it should be made . The idea of an invasion of the continent from England could be said to have started at Dunkirk in 1940 , when British soldiers were tia E , I V n.1 ) AY nv , r4 n4 T DDay ( Cominocd from Page 21 ) who was then commander in chief in the Mediterranean , to take command of the invasion of France . In January the names of his top British subordinates were announced : Air Chief Marshal Tedder as Deputy Supreme Commander , and Admiral Ramsay , General Montgomery and Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mallory to command the navies , armies and air forces . Lt. Gen. W. Bedell Smith , of the United States , was named Eisenhower 's chief of stall , and General Morgan became deputy chief of stall . Stalin was impatient for the opening of what the Russians called a second front . Roosevelt and Churchill had promised him the invasion would start in May ; and so . when the commanders took up their appointments in January . there were only four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details of the COSSAC plan , they both declared the area of the landing was too narrow and the troops for the first assault too few . General Morgan had thought so himself , but the size of the whole operation had been limited by the number of landing craft which existed or could be built in time . At Eisenhower 's demand , landing craft were gathered in from all over the world ; but still there were not enough for the extra forces he wanted . As a last resort , the landing was postponed till early June to gain another month 's production of new craft . But Churchill was worried by the thought of what Stalin would say when May ended and the promise had not been fulfilled . The exact date which was chosen in June was decided by the tides , the plan of attack and the German defenses . Reconnaissance photographs of the coast of France were taken by aircraft every day that spring . They showed Germans and French civilians hard at work building new gun emplacements and installing obstacles on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spikes . Some of them were mined . These obstacles offered a choice of evils . If a landing were made at high tide , when the obstacles were submerged , many landing craft might be impaled . If the landing were made at low tide , the troops would have to cross an open beach 300 or 400 yards wide under German fire , Eisenhower and Montgomery decided to land just after low tide , putting tanks ahead of the infantry and bombarding the defenses . They planned to demolish the obstacles at once , so that landings could continue as the tide rose . The navy wanted to approach the coast under cover of night , but both sea and air forces needed an hour of daylight for the bombardment . These considerations fixed the time of the landing at an hour after dawn . By combining this time with the state of the tide , the date of the landing was fixed . Low tide in Normandy was an hour after dawn on June sixth . On June fifth and seventh , it was near enough to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right again until about June twentieth : but the moon would have waned by then , and the air-borne forces preferred moonlight for parachute and glider landings . So June fifth was chosen as D Day , with the next two days as alternatives if June fifth weather was had . hi hour , the moment of landing , was 6:30 A.M. at the western end of the area of the landing , which the tide reaches soonest , and 7:30 A.M. at the eastern end . Of course , the Germans knew an invasion was coming . Just before Montgomery was appointed to command the invad ing army , his old adversary of the desert war in Africa , Field Marshal Rommel , was appointed to the defense of the coast of Europe . For two years German propagandists had talked of the Atlantic Wall , which was supposed to be a chain of impregnable defenses all along the coast . But Rommel found that the Atlantic Wall was little more than propaganda . Its building had been given a low priority , and on many parts of the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man of tremendous energy , While preparations for the invasion were going forward in Britain , he was working at top speed to build fortifications to defeat it . It was his work which reconnaissance showed in progress . But the work was made difficult by differences of opinion among the high command . Rommel believed an invasion could only be halted on the shore . His immediate senior , Field Marshal von Rundstedt , thought that was impossible . He put his trust in reserves , which he proposed to hold back till the exact intentions of the invading forces could be seen . Von Rundstedt was convinced the main landing would be in Calais , and the higher command of the army in Germany agreed with him . Rommel favored Normandy , and so , it is said , did Hitler . These disagreements were the result , at least in part , of deception by the Allies . Having decided on Normandy . they did everything they could to persuade the Germans they had decided on Calais . While armies and fleets were assembling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were assembled in the southeast . All the radio activity of an army was simulated in Kent . Gen. George Patton , whom the Germans knew well , was brought from the Mediterranean to England with ample publicity to command this then-nonexistent army . At the last moment , while the fleets were sailing to Normandy , dummy fleets of ships and aircraft headed for Calais , using devices which made them appear on radar screens to be much larger than they were . The British secret service also was at work to implant this false belief in the minds of German commanders . Its task was probably simplified by disagreement between the German secret service and the Nazi leaders . Admiral Canaris , the head of the German secret service , had recently been dismissed , and most of his organization disbanded . A new all-Nazi service had been started under Himmler , the Gestapo chieftain . After the war , in German files , about 250 reports from Himmler 's men were found to predict the place and time of the invasion . All of them were wrong except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information circulated by British agents . Nobody in Berlin had acted on the single report which was right . The deception was to successful that von Rundstedt went on believing for several weeks after the invasion that the landing in Normandy was a feint and that the main attack was still to come in Calais , and he still kept his reserves in the Calais area . In fact , the faking was much more successful than anyone expected at the time . Looking back now , it seems likely that some kind of deception more convincing than dummies or rumors was in use , that the British had a direct method of giving false information to the German high command , and giving it with such authority that the Germans could nut disbelieve it . Students of spy stories may imagine what the method might have been ; whatever it was , it is still kept secret and probably always will be . During May , the troops who were to lead the attack had finished long and arduous training . The sea-borne forces had landed in exercises against live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normandy , and each unit had practiced assaults on replicas of the particular German defenses it was expected to attack . But none of them yet had been told where they would be going or when . In May , packed into great camps in the south of England with little to do , men began to feel bored and apprehensive . Most of this feeling disappeared at the end of the month when briefing began . The briefing gave every man the feeling that whoever was planning the thing was leaving nothing to chance . Every man was shown maps and models of his objective and aerial photographs of the shore . Some were so clear that individual German soldiers manning the defenses could be seen . Once the briefing had started , the whole vast process of the invasion was irreversible . It had to go on or else be abandoned . Success depended on surprise and secrecy . The camps in which men were briefed were therefore cut off from the rest of the world . Men were allowed in , but nobody was allowed out again except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and civilian travel was restricted . A zone along the coast was sealed off . The few remaining ways out of the country were closed . Diplomats of neutral countries found they could not communicate with their governments , which was an unprecedented breach of international custom . Ireland was especially under suspicion , because the Germans had a flourishing embassy in Dublin . But this state of readiness could not be kept up for long , and the longer it lasted the more chance there was that the secret would leak out of the country . The people responsible for security had a series of minor scares . Once , an American major general was sent back to the States as a colonel for what was thought to be careless talk in the Claridge 's Hotel . On a hot morning in May , when a window was open in the War Office in London , twelve copies of a top-secret dispatch which gave the whole show away blew out and fluttered down into the crowded street below . Staff officers pounded down the stairs , found eleven copies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twelfth . It had been picked up by a passer-by , who gave it to the sentry on the Horse Guards Parade on the opposite side of Whitehall . Who was this person ? Would he be likely to gossip ? Nobody ever knew . The oddest of all the scares was The Daily Telegraph crossword puzzle of May twenty-second . When this puzzle was solved , it included the name Omaha . which was the code name for one of the beaches where Americans were to land , and the word " dives , " which might have been the Dives River , on which the left flank of the invasion was to rest . Another suspicious name in it was Dover . It caused some concern to staff officers , and in after years it provided a story with unlimited scope for growth . After Eisenhower had extended the original COSSAC plan , the area of the landing covered sixty miles of the coast of France , from the Dives River near Caen to the east side , of the Cotentin Peninsula , commonly called the Cherbourg peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air-borne troops , Americans at the west end and British at the east , were to land by parachute and glider during the night to protect the flanks of the seaborne forces . In the first light of dawn great fleets of naval ships and aircraft were to bombard the coast . As the bombardment stopped , the sea-borne forces were to land on ( Continued on Page 641 64 ( Continued film /'u ass ) live Separate stretches of beech , each three or four miles long . The Americans had two stretches of beach , one on each side of the estuary of the Vire River ; these had the code names Utah and Omaha . The three other beaches were known as Gold , Juno and Sword . Gold and Sword were British objectives ; Juno was mainly Canadian . The British and Canadian troops for the first assault were about equal in number to the Americans . The air forces also were equal . About three quarters of the naval forces were British . The fleet of 5333 ships and landing craft was the largest ever assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vie bombardment before the landing was the heaviest ever planned . Dozens of new devices , from artificial harbors to amphibious tanks , had been invented to solve new problems . The naval-operation orders , three inches thick on extra-large sheets of paper , were the fattest ever printed . But individual soldiers and sailors were only vaguely aware of these superlatives . Nobody could see 5000 ships or 9000 aircraft at a glance , and nobody , not even the highest commanders , had any firsthand impression of the whole tremendous undertaking . Each man who dropped from the sky or plunged into the surf that morning was aware only of what was happening within the short distance he could see and of the hope and fear and resolution within himself . It is from that point of view , rather than in terms of enormous figures , that the only true impression of the morning can be given . Several of the senior officers who commanded the forces of invasion have remarked that the first assault was a soldier 's battle , not a general 's battle . Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portsmouth , knew practically nothing of what was happening until the first phase of the battle had been completed . The names of the high commanders , therefore , have little place in the narrative of the landing . But when everything was ready , they still had to give the order to go  --  an order fraught with unexpected anxiety and drama . Absolutely everything was organized except the weather . For a landing on Monday , the fifth of June , some naval units had to sail on Friday the second . These included the " heavy ships for the bombardment , which were starting from Scotland and Northern Ireland . The movement of men and materials out of the camps and into landing craft and transports also had to start on that day . It would still be possible on the third to postpone everything for twenty-four hours , but by dawn on the fourth the leading ships would have gone too far to be recalled . Weather which was reasonably calm and clear was regarded as absolutely essential for the landing . All through May the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first it turned dull and gray , and on June second the meteorologists reported a complex system of three depressions approaching from the Atlantic . On June third they forecast high winds , low cloud and bad visibility for the fifth , sixth and seventh  --  the only three days when low tide was at the right time in the morning . This forecast was presented at 9:30 P.M. on June third in Southwick House , at a conference of Eisenhower , his deputy , his three commanders in chief and their chiefs of staff . The first ships had sailed , tens of thousands of men were cooped up in landing craft and transports , the camps they had left were being filled by follow-up troops ; the whole immense machine was in motion . The problem at that moment was whether to let it go on or to stop it for twenty-four hours . Either way , the possibilities of disaster were clear . Many accounts have been given of this all-important meeting and of three meetings which followed in the next thirty-six hours . In their details the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because only nine men were present at the meetings , and nobody was there as a mere observer . One may imagine that their capacity for thought and feeling was taxed to the limit , so that none of them could detach his mind.from the problem and observe exactly what happened , and remember it for the sake of historians . The men were General Eisenhower , Air Chief Marshal Tedder , Admiral Ramsay , General Montgomery and Air Chief ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Marshal Leigh-Mallory ; and the four chiefs of staff , Lt , Gen. Bedell Smith , Rear Admiral Creasy , Major General de Guingand and Air Marshal Robb . It seems strange in retrospect that only two , Eisenhower and Smith , were American and seven British . But for the moment the British could only advise ; the ultimate responsibility was Eisenhower 's . In looking back at that moment of decision . one may also glance back further at the qualifications of the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military academy at West Point was not very distinguished , and when he was graduated he was sixty-first in a class of 164 . That was in 1915 . During the First World War he was never sent overseas and never saw battle , and between the wars his promotion was slow . Three years before he became Supreme Commander he was still a lieutenant colonel . His quick rise through the ranks in those three years was largely due to General Marshall , the American Chief of Staff . Of course , Marshall did not push a him n e nuopr mwoi tuhso fuut nrde torsi ? nn ) , i t a sreyn knowledge and the analytical brain which high command requires . But probably another reason for his appointment to the European command was simply that everybody liked him . An American general in command of British armies  --  and especially of British generals  --  needed more than military judgment which everyone would respect ; he also needed exceptional tact and charm and humor . Eisenhower certainly had those qualities . He could be strict and tough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modest man . He had none of the flamboyance which generals find so irritating in other generals . This was the man who , after fifty years of obscurity , had to preside over the meeting of his British commanders in chief at Southwick House and balance their opinions and make the decision on which the course of history and the lives of countless men depended . At the meeting on Saturday evening , June third , the report of the meteorologists and the advice of the commanders in chief made him almost certain that the operation would have to be postponed . It was an unwelcome prospect . Plans had been made by which everything could be brought to a standstill for twenty-four hours , but Eisenhower was sure that postponement would be hard on the morale and the physical condition of the troops already at sea . And any delay would add to the risk of the secret 's leaking out . He decided to hold another meeting at 4:30 the next morning , Sunday , June fourth , in the hope of some improvement in the forecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American landing craft sailed from their ports in south Devon and Cornwall and began their voyage along the English coast . The next morning the forecast was just as bad . At this meeting Ramsay doubted whether his smaller craft could cross the channel in the seas which were predicted . Leigh-Mallory was certain the air forces would not be able to play their full part in the plan . By then , the main forces were due to sail in two hours ' time . Eisenhower gave the order to postpone the sailing for twenty-four hours and recall the ships at sea . The fleet of big ships steaming south down the Irish Sea turned about , to steam north for twelve hours . But the postponement had not solved Eisenhower 's problem . On Sunday evening he faced the same terrible choice in an even more difficult form . The forecasters offered a chance , and only a chance , of a slight temporary improvement on Tuesday morning . The choice was therefore between launching the invasion on Tuesday , the sixth , in weather which was nothing better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the tides were right again . And so Eisenhower put off the final decision till early the following morning . During that night he carried as heavy a burden as has fallen to the lot of any man . Everyone who had been at the evening meeting remembered one phrase he had used : The question is , how long can you hang this operation out on a limb and let it hang there ? " The troops could not stay in their ships for two weeks . But they had been briefed and told where they were to land . If all of them were brought ashore again , it was impossible to hope that the secret would not leak . So far the German Air Force seemed to have spotted only a small proportion of the fleet and had never attacked it . That luck was too astonishing to last . The Germans were known to have " secret weapons " ? soon to be identified as buzz bombs or " doodlebugs " ? which were nearly ready and might be used in attacks on the crowded harbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks of confusion , of loss of security and or counterattack that the whole plan might have to be abandoned , But the alternative of launching the invasion in uncertain weather was risky too . If the forecast was only slightly overoptimistic , landing craft would be 1 swamped , naval and air bombardment would be inaccurate , German bombers might be able to take off while Allied fighters were grounded , and the invasion ? might end in the greatest military disaster which either the United States or Britain had ever suffered . And finally , if the invasion failed , it would be impossible to try again that summer  --  perhaps impossible ever to try again . All the hopes and power of the United States and Britain had been put into this one attempt to bring the Germans to battle in Western Europe . If it failed , hope might also fail , not only in America and Britain but also in the countries which the Germans had occupied ; the Russians might decide their allies were useless and make a separate peace . Eisenhower , with expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be impossible ever to win the war . He has never described his own feelings on that night of decision , but some indication of them is given by the announcement he drafted , without telling anyone , some time on June fifth : Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold , and I have withdrawn the troops . My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available . The troops , the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do . If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt , it is mine alone . When he had written this , he put it in his pocket in case it was needed . By that time he had already decided to commit his forces to the hazard of landing , whatever the weather might bring . All through the meetings Montgomery had been willing to start . Ramsay had agreed , but reluctantly . Leigh-Mallory , speaking for the air forces , had wanted to wait ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday , he , too , had agreed that the chance must be taken , and Eisenhower had launched the invasion with the words , " O.K. We 'll go . " That evening , when the ships had sailed , he drove to an airfield fifty miles inland , near Newbury , where American parachutists were waiting to take off . He had a particular concern for these men . Some 13,000 of them were to drop that night in the Cherbourg peninsula . Four months before , Leigh-Mallory had opposed the American drop because it had to be made in wooded and well-defended country . He had predicted that 50 to 70 per cent of the troop-carrying aircraft would be lost . Only a week before , he had come to Eisenhower again to protest against what he called the futile slaughter of two fine American divisions . Eisenhower had never agreed with his pessimistic view , but it was no light matter to act against the advice of his air commander in chief . Of all his personal worries that day , the worst , he said afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him guilty of the blind sacrifice of these thousands of young Americans . At the airfield , concealing this thought , he strolled round among paratroopers , talking cheerfully to anyone who caught his eye . The men were full of confidence . One of them , who had a ranch in Texas , offered him ( Continued on Page 66 ) T II It SATUR DAN ' EVENINf ; l ' ( ) ST ( Contimml firin Page 64 ) a job when the war was over . As darkness fell they embarked in their aircraft . and Eisenhower watched the planes take off into the gathering night . At the same time others were taking off from airfields all over England , and soon the sky overhead was full of the sound of them . Probably Eisenhower had hardly noticed the countryside around the airfield , but the parachutists knew it well . When they left their base at Fort Bragg in North Carolina , they had been told that England was a combat zone . Many of them , after crossing the Atlantic to their camps in Wiltshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills , ancient stone pubs and churches , thatched villages with incredible names  --  Chilton Foliat , Straight Soley and Crooked Soley , Ogbournc Saint George , and the place which was written Mildeahall and spoken of as " Minal . " There was no sign of combat , but every symbol of ancient peace and calm . Almost nothing could change the peaceful ways  --  of those English villages . Most of their young men and women had gone away . The people who remained had plodded on , working harder than ever before to grow more food than the land had ever produced and spending what leisure time was left in the Home Guard , the civil defense , the first aid or the fire watchers . When the Americans came , the people of the villages watched their activities without much surprise . Mass parachute drops became such a common sight that they hardly bothered to look up . But when the Americans suddenly disappeared , the villages seemed very strange without them . On the evening of the fifth , when Eisenhower was at the airfield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a couple of miles away , was a desolate place . Nobody was in except the local regulars sitting over their mild and bitter . The landlord and the regulars wondered where the Americans had gone and agreed that they rather missed the noise and hustle . At closing time , with these thoughts still in his mind , the landlord locked the bar , washed up the glasses and went out to shut up his chickens . It was while he was out there in the meadow behind the pub that the airfield came to life . The aircraft came up over the elms in twos , in dozens , in scores ; they circled overhead and took up formation , and others came from farther north in hundreds . Standing there in awe , he called to his wife to come and listen . " This is it , " he said . Down on the coast everybody knew , even before the planes came over and flew out across the sea . In the coast-guard but on the top of Saint Alban 's Head , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day he had been witness of a spectacle vaster and braver than had ever been seen on that historic shore . Saint Alban 's Head is high . From the top of it the view extends across the channel to the south ; to the east across Weymouth Bay to Portland ; to the west across the approaches of Southampton Water to the Isle of Wight ; to the north , through the gentle folds of the Purbeck Hills to the gray stone village of Worth Matravers . The village and the coast-guard but on the top of the cliff had been home for Mr. Wallace for many years . He knew everyone in the place . Originally he had come from Bristol , but his wife had been born in Worth Matravers , and it was on her account that he had come there in his middle age and settled down to a contented life as a coast guard , a churchwarden and a chairman of the parish council . That was before the coast-guard but had become an outpost looking over no man 's land . In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Head had always been busy with ships , In 1940 the sea had changed . Tired soldiers without weapons , straight back from Dunkirk , had been put into camps among the hills . Farmers had sharpened pitchforks , the Local Defense Volunteers had paraded with pikes , the coast guards had armed themselves with knobbed sticks to repel the invasion ; and the sea , for the first time in centuries , had been absolutely empty . For week after week that year not a single ship had been sighted from the hut , and the only entries in the coast-guard log were of German aircraft patrolling the English Channel . Ever since those days , four years before , Mr. Wallace had seen the channel become a battlefield . He saw the first coastal convoys , attacks by E-boats , sinking ships , crashing aircraft , deaths and rescues . And all through those years he had the sense of standing on the very edge of the world , for the known , orderly civilized world ended then within gunshot of the cliffs of England . Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the terrors which the ancients imagined beyond the Ocean . This feeling of an uncrossablc frontier made the sight which Wallace saw on the fifth of June more wonderful . For several weeks the harbor at Portland , seventeen miles to the westward , had been filling with ships . Then it had begun to overflow , and all the seventeen-mile sweep of Weymouth Bay had begun to fill . A screen of destroyers had been thrown across the bay . The destroyers turned close in below his but and steamed back and forth all night and day across the mouth of the bay to Portland Bill ; and inside the screen ever more and more ships had anchored . Then , on the day before , between the squalls of rain , he had seen still hundreds more come in  --  landing craft and escorts which had come up from Cornwall and Devon and then , on Eisenhower 's order , turned back to shelter . And that morning the fleet had sailed . He could not possibly count the ships ; in fact , many more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliffs of the headland he looked down on landing craft packed with troops . Beyond them , line after line of tank landing craft passed by , escorted by motor launches . There were armed trawlers and ocean tugs , and far out and ahead there were echelons of mine sweepers . Hundreds of ships were flying barrage balloons . Destroyers and frigates took up their stations out to sea ; French , British and American cruisers ; tank landing ships and infantry transports carrying small landing craft in davits ; and on the horizon , coming up from the west beyond Portland , battleships and monitors and heavy cruisers . Fighter planes wove patterns overhead Then , in the east , more landing craft and escorts emerged from Poole , and in the far distance another separate fleet steamed out of The Solent . Wallace stood on the head of the cliff . entranced by a pageant of splendor the like of which nobody had ever seen before , nor is likely ever to see again . Before evening the last of the ships had gone , hull down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty . He was on his way home when dusk had fallen and the sound in the sky began . At home his wife was listening . " This is it , " he said to her ; and later that night , when they were ready to go to bed , he said , " A lot of men are going to die tonight , We should pray for them . " They knelt by the side of the bed .
