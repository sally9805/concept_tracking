The Dead Sea Scrolls have already raised more dust in Christendom than anything since Darwin , and will certainly kick up more in years to come . It is well known that the scrolls were the sacred documents of a monastic sect living 20 centuries ago at Qumran , in what is now Jordan , and that the members of the sect hid the scrolls in caves to safeguard them from advancing Roman legions . But who were these people of the Dead Sea ? The question is momentous , because they lived near the place where John the Baptist preached the Messiah 's coming , during the time that Jesus taught and the Gospel sources were compiled . And some of their writings seem to show parallels of word and thought with the New Testament itself . <P> Published last week were two new additions to the growing literature on the Dead Sea Scrolls , taking sharply contrasting points of view . <P> The Similarities . John M. Allegro ( The Dead Sea Scrolls ; Pelican ; 85 ) is a bright young ( 33 ) British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international team of scholars that is piecing together and translating the scroll fragments in Jerusalem . Back at Manchester University ( where he now occupies a teaching post in comparative Semitic philology ) , bearded John Allegro turned his reputation for brightness to one for brashness ; he drew a public rebuke from his fellow scholars ( TIME , April 2 ) when he suggested that the New Testament 's Jesus Christ may have been modeled on the scrolls ' " Teacher of Righteousness , " who said Allegro on the basis of guess work , was also crucified . Allegro 's new book prudently plays down this wild surmise . But together with a vivid account of the discoveries , Allegro gives nonscholarly readers plenty of speculation to chew on , if not necessarily to swallow . <P> Though he does not see the Qumran sect as the originator of Christianity , Allegro feels that it profoundly influenced the first Christians . Withdrawn into the desert from the persecution of a corrupt priesthood in Jerusalem , holding in contempt the scribes and Pharisees ( whom they called " Seekers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptism , chastity , community of goods . They wrote the ritual of a Messianic banquet with breaking of bread and blessing of wine , which Allegro boldly suggests may prefigure the Last Supper and Christian Communion . They expected the imminent end of the world and the coming of two Messiahs-a priest and a king of the Davidic line . Into the latter role , says Allegro , Jesus would fit perfectly-later to have the priestly messiahship added to the kingly one . <P> The Differences . Like most other scholars , Allegro identifies the Qumran sect with the Essenes , who almost surely had a monastery near the Dead Sea at the same point as the Qumran ruins . The Essenes , says Allegro , had a kind of " Third Order " of laymen living according to a modified rule in the towns and villages of Palestine , and " it seems reasonable to assume that Jesus was acquainted with such people . " He adds : " It is possible that the ' great company of priests ' who were ' obedient to the faith , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spiritual leadership of this movement . "
