The Sword and the Rose ( Walt Disney ; RKO Radio ) is an old-fashioned piece of historical romance done with stylized charm and sly wit . Based on Charles Major 's popular 1898 novel , When Knighthood Was in Flower , it tells the love story of Princess Mary Tudor ( 1496-1533 ) and Captain of the Guard Charles Brandon . Before the two lovers were married in 1515 , Mary had to overcome the objections of her brother , King Henry VIII , submit to a short-lived political marriage with aging , ailing King Louis XII of France , and , according to the movie , contend with the machinations of the malevolent Duke of Buckingham , who wanted the princess for himself . <P> A rich combination of high romance and low melodrama , the picture has a fine archaic atmosphere . Examples : the brilliantly Technicolored pageantry of a court dance , a royal game of shuttlecock , Henry VIII riding to the hunt , a contest between French and English wrestling champions at Windsor Castle . <P> As Charles Brandon , Richard Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing her a sonnet , and fighting off the evil duke and his henchmen . Portly James Robertson Justice plays a younger and more forceful Henry VIII than the one Charles Laughton has made familiar to moviegoers . As Mary Tudor , elfin-faced Glynis Johns , with her wryly insinuating voice , gives a winning characterization of a conniving little royal baggage .
