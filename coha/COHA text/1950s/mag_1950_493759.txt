THE WEEK ' ENE UN AND 111Z CRISIS LANE SUCCESS ( NR spendont ) The gloom steadily deepened at Lake Success last week . Not only were things going badly in the fighting in Korea ; they were going as badly as possible in the Security Council . Those who had hoped that the arrival of the Chinese Communist mission would reveal some possible bridge between East and West were completely disillusioned by the opening speech of Wu Hsiu-chuan ( who does not want to be called General ) , head of the mission . In one sense , Wu made an impressive statement of the Chinese Communists ' case , in that he argued like a skillful lawyer , quoting from President Truman , from Chiang Kai-shek , from various New York newspapers and from other documentary sources ; but his speech was - a monstrous piling of lie upon lie , on all fours with the barefaced Russian performances which it so closely paralleled . The United States is the aggressor ; no Chinese Communists are fighting in Korea except volunteers ( of whom American delegate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet planes ? " ) . The presence of the Chinese Nationalists in the UN is illegal , and , therefore , all the acts of the UN are illegal . The Chinese people said Wu have consistently supported all proposals for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question and for genuinely localizing the Korean war . .. . Who has been extending the Korean War ? Who has shattered security in the Pacific ? You have guessed the answer : the United States . Our armed aggression against TaiNkan Formosa is definitely not any " temporary measure " arising out of the Korean war , but rather a premeditated plan that had been decided long before the civil war in Korea was created . This US armed aggression was directed toward vastly extending and not toward " localizing " the Korean war , toward seeking " to dominate every Asiatic port from Vladivostok to Singapore . " . . . The American imperialists have never been the friends of the Chinese people . They have always been the enemies of the Chinese people . . . . American imperialists adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " equal opportunity " policy which , though ostensibly different from the policies of the other imperialist powers , was in fact an aggressive policy aimed at sharing the spoils with the other imperialists . . . . The US Government and the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang reactionary clique signed all kinds of unequal treaties and agreements which reduced China to the status of a colony and military base of the United States . . . . The US Government has taken this series of aggressive acts with the purpose of realizing its fanatical design of dominating Asia and the world . . . . American imperialism has taken the place of Japanese imperialism . If we were forced to take Wu at face value , the situation would be hopeless ; the Third World War would already be in progress , and our predicament perilous in the extreme . But as everyone knows , totalitarian language does not necessarily march with totalitarian thought . Many delegations at the UN still believe some sort of settlement other than all-out world war is yet possible . There is no denying that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provocative in the timing of his supposedly final offensive and prefer the repeated proposals of the British for a buffer zone along the Yalu . In so far as President Truman and Secretary Acheson are backing MacArthur ( and nobody here is quite sure how far that is ) , there has been and is deep dissatisfaction between the US and some other powers . At the same time , there is no suggestion of anything but sticking together to work our way out of the mess as best we can . CONGRESS IN LOW GEAR With only a month in which to consider several key measures requested by the President , Congress got off to a slow start last week . On its first day back , the House met for only 41 minutes and adjourned for three days . Despite the two-month recess , none of the House committees had any legislation ready to bring to the floor . The Senate met for 50 minutes , mostly to shake hands and console the " lame ducks . " But the following day the disturbing turn of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded , and even Senator Wherry , who in his opening press conference had predicted there would not be time this session to carry out any of President Tru- ? man 's wishes , said " the situation in Korea is critical and compels unity of all leaders in our Government in making vital decisions of policy that must be made . " There was talk of keeping Congress in session through Christmas to assure passage of emergency measures . Statehood for Alaska and Hawaii , passed earlier this year by the House , was first on President Truman 's list for Senate action . In a letter to Vice President Barkley , the President said Hawaii and Alaska arc not only vital to the defense of the United States in the Pacific , but " they are also the proving ground of our democratic institutions in the Pacific area , with tremendous psychological influence on the hearts and minds of the people of Asia and the Pacific islands . " Both territories maintain a high degree of military readiness . The security of our national defense forces there , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local population . Both areas pay all federal taxes , although they have no voice in levying them or in spending the tax revenues . Their young men serve in our armed forces . " It is now obvious , " the President said , " that the people of both territories can exercise effectively all the rights of self-government under statehood both in local and national affairs . . . " Southern Senators held a caucus on statehood and civil rights issues and took the floor in protest . Richard Russell ( D , Ga. ) , leader of the Southern bloc in the Senate , said that enough Dixie Senators opposed statehood to keep a filibuster going if the Administration presses the issue during this interim session . Southerners have long opposed admission of Alaska and Hawaii out of fear that it would upset their balance of power in Congress on civil rights issues . Sen. John C. Stennis ( D , Miss. ) deplored the fact that the four new Senators would represent only about 120,000 people in Alaska and about 460,000 in Hawaii . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaware , Nevada , Vermont , Wyoming . ) In the special election in 1947 which sent Stennis to the Senate , the total vote in Mississippi was 191,719 , out of a population of 2,183,796 . WOOD-UTT TON YUGOSLAVIA For a while this fall it looked as though the Cominform 's dire forecasts of doom for " traitorous Tito " might come true . A ruinous Balkan drought hit hard at Yugoslavia 's fragile economic strength , burning up the crops of corn and wheat which are its food staples . The drought also threatened to cut the slim trickle of raw materials which Tito has been getting through the Cominform blockade in trade for normal farm surpluses . The drought will cost a total of $600 million , the equivalent of a $30 billion loss to the US . The choices for Tito 's rebel Communist regime appeared grim : slacken the crucial military support for the army which faces hostile Stalinists from the West , East and North , or risk large-scale starvation when food supplies ran out during the winter months . The big gap in basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . Aid from the West has been increasing in direct proportion to the growing Soviet pressure , but Tito 's role is difficult . There is a limit to how deeply a Communist regime , no matter how threatened , can permit itself to be obligated to the capitalist US . American diplomats , however , were up to the situation . US Ambassador George Allen quietly pursued discussions with Tito 's officials which developed into a program of direct American economic assistance . Stop-gap arrangements were made to assure a gradual inflow of aid . Export-Import Bank loans , previously granted for specific industrial projects , were diverted to the purchase of US food surpluses which were rushed overseas to allow the Yugoslays to supply the mountain regions near the Adriatic and in Macedonia before winter made them inaccessible . ECA flour and lard were sent on from their original Ger-man and Italian destina-tions to bolster up the supplies of a newly-created Relief Commis-sion , formed by Tito 's Economic Council . Fi-nally , the US announc-ed that Military Assist-ante Program funds were being used to supply food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were allotted to a country not signatory to the Atlantic Pact . By the end of last month , $30 million worth of food supplies had been committed under these programs , about half of the mini-mum necessary to carry the country through on cut rations . Then President Truman asked Congress to establish the program on a regular basis through an aid bill providing another $38 million in food and another $35 million program will probably be put before the next session . Congress ' decision , determined under the pressure of a continued Korean War , may not come easy . Aid to Tito means not only a calculated military risk , but the political soul-searching involved in full-scale assistance to an avowed Communist regime . While the Yugoslays are determined to preserve their position " between the blocs , " assistance from the US will strengthen their position both internally and externally . There 's still a step from using MAP funds for feeding the army to helping augment its inadequate equipment . But Tito 's hope is that if we help feed an army , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COST OT LIVING CLIMBS The announcement by the Bureau of Labor Statistics last week that retail prices reached a new all-time high during October came as no surprise to consumers . The index of prices of goods and services bought by moderate-income families has climbed to 2.7 percent above the last pre-Korean index in June ; 3.7 percent higher than October , 1949 ; and 31 percent higher than June , 1946 . House furnishings , wearing apparel and rents showed the heaviest increases . Higher prices for dairy products , eggs , fruits and vegetables were mainly responsible for the rise in the food index between mid-September and mid-October . Egg prices were up 7.4 percent , dairy products rose 2.9 percent , bringing them to the highest level since February , 1949 , and canned fruit and vegetable prices rose 2.6 percent above last month . Household rents rose .6 percent in the three months prior to October 15 . In 11 cities surveyed , increases ranged from .1 percent in Buffalo and New York City to 1.8 percent in Savannah . As a result of the index , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the GM wage-adjustment formula , approximately 357,000 workers will receive an additional three cents per hour allowance after December 1 . Another 80,000 GM employees will receive an additional $15 , or a total of $55 , for the period between December 1 , 1950 , and March 1 , 1951 , when the next review of the cost of living will be made based on the BLS index of January . ASIA 'S SPENDING SPREE The American Medical Association has no intention of relaxing its efforts against President Truman 's health insurance program . Its multi-million dollar advertising campaign , timed to coincide with the November elections , proved so successful that the doctor lobby has announced it will continue the drive ? at least until 1952 , a Presidential election year . Elmer L. Henderson , president of the AMA , said last week that the election results " were very reassuring . " Referring specifically to the defeat of Sen. Elbert D. Thomas ( D , Utah ) and Rep. Andrew J. Biemiller ( D , Wis. ) , two of the staunchest supporters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of physicians " had a vital influence on the results . The 144,500 members of AMA contributed $3.6 million this year in $25 assessments for the " war chest " against the health program . Dr. Henderson revealed that the AMA has budgeted another $300,000 for its publicity representatives , extending their contract two more years . The AMA has been listed as one of the top spenders ever since the Federal Lobbying Act went into effect . Lobby reports for the third quarter of 1950 , released last week , showed that during the first nine months of this year the AMA spent $1,290,798 . The AMA 's National Education Campaign reported spending $814,547 more and distributed some 43,041,437 pieces of literature in the same period . The Chicago public relations firm of Whitaker &; Baxter , which conducted the Education Campaign , listed expenditures of over $300,000 . In addition , the AMA spent around $75,000 on Washington salaries , overhead , travel and communications . AMA 's spending spree shows some signs of backfiring , however . The concentrated two-week advertising campaign in October brought more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage of doctors , emphasized by the doctor draft legislation necessitated by the Korean War , has caused critics to point out that the AMA blocked aid to medical schools legislation during the past session . Even James F. Byrnes , governor-elect of South Carolina , recently warned that " if the doctors do not get their own house in order , and if we do n't train enough doctors so that competition exists among doctors , then the fight against socialized medicine may be lost . " " CRISIS " DI PRANCE The week of the big Korean reverse found the French Government tottering as the result of moderate deputies in the Assembly supporting a cleverly-timed Communist attack on Socialist Defense Minister Jules Moch . The crisis had no relation to Korea , Germany or military budget . Its chief effect was to point out once again the capricious nature of French politics . At the end of the week the coalition cabinet of Socialists , MRP and Radical Socialists , under ' Reni Pleven , won a new vote of confidence by an open party vote in the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer his Government 's resignation arose from the indiscretions of two French generals , who in 1948 had allowed a highly-secret report on Indo-China to find its way into Viet - Minh hands . The incident had been investigated , a 188-page report presented to the Assembly and the generals cashiered . But the spy involved had been too fast for the French in fleeing to South America , where Jules Mock then in charge of police , could not prosecute him . Catching the Government off balance , the Communists introduced a secret-ballot resolution demanding that Moch be brought to trial . Many right-wing and Center deputies joined in because of the opportunity to undercut Moch personally and the Socialists in general . In protest , against the large-scale defection of their supposed allies in the Government coalition , the Socialist ministers resigned enmasse , followed shortly after by the rest of the cabinet . When President Vincent Auriol refused to accept Plevens resignation be cause of the international crises , the Premier rallied his forces and demanded a vote of confidence including an $80-billion increase in funds for defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to symbolize the widespread French unwillingness to focus on the crucial problems of threatening war . As Mao 's troops swept southward , the deputies pursued their pet political projects , and belatedly adopted a resolution calling for " conversations . . . with the Government of China on the basis of the independence and unity of Korea " to remedy the " aggravation of the international situation . " Meanwhile , in London , where the North Atlantic Deputies were meeting in an attempt to agree on large-scale European rearmament , the French put forth some careful modifications of their original Pleven Plan position . They modified their previous insistence that European rearmament come into effect only after settlement of pending political and economic questions . The French are now proposing a continental defense force made up of international divisions , within which national combat teams would be commanded by their own officers , leaving the way open for large German forces and even admitting German officers to positions of high command . Moch had previously been criticized in the US for insisting that no German units larger than battalions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by impatient Americans , but any decisive action on Europe 's defense awaits a final answer on how many troops the US sends across the Atlantic .
