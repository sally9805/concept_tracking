Even if he had not made the speech he did . the annual convention of the powerful ( 613,000 members ) National Education Association would undoubtedly have given Adlai Stevenson a healthy round of applause . Instead , it gave him a standing ovation , for he had told his audience exactly what it wanted to hear . President Eisenhower , said Stevenson , now proposes to spend $45 on highways to every $1 he proposes to spend on schools . " I must deny that this 45-to-1 ratio . . . represents the standards or the priority of the people of America . " Thereupon . Stevenson made his recommendation . Since the national income is expected to rise $15 billion a year and since this will mean an added $4 billion in federal revenue , " I suggest , in effect , that we agree with ourselves to spend on education-say. 20% of our federal tax collections from our new national wealth . " <P> Welcome as these words were , the N.E.A. was all set to top them . The Legislative Commission called for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school construction , 2 ) a teacher 's minimum salary of $4.000 , and 3 ) a college scholarship program for bright students . <P> " Because of inadequately trained teachers and poor buildings , " said the commission 's Executive Secretary James McCaskill. " we are depriving about 6.000,000 children each year of a good schooling . " <P> Though federal aid has been a perennial N.E.A. theme , it seemed this year to have become something of an obsession-so much so , in fact , that some educators were beginning to talk of forming a huge political-action organization to lobby for their demands in state legislatures and Congress . " Without such an organization , " said Earl McGrath . onetime U.S. Commissioner of Education and now president of the University of Kansas City , " I believe that education will be continuously handicapped in competition with the other social groups which have been effectively organized . " But is political action , however nonpartisan , really a proper function for the nation 's teachers ? Said Oakland 's Rex Turner , chairman of the Legislative Commission that approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these terms . <P> If we are ever to get better schools , we will have to meet the issue squarely on the political front .
