More than a million Americans , many still in their teens , fought , and survived , the Korean War . The G.I. never quite understood what this particularly bewildering war was all about . But he fought well , and reached his own understanding of Korea by personal , painful , ugly experience . <P> For one thing , he understood death . There was the first mound of corpses by the roadside , caked with dried blood , open mouths frozen in a scream . His sergeant said : ' ' Do n't get shook up . They 're just Koreans . " Or there were muddy U.S. Army boots protruding awkwardly from under a blanket as a litter jeep bounced down the road from the front . Or in the rain , as he climbed his first Korean hill , there was the glistening poncho stretched over the two men sleeping near the trail-and then he realized that they were asleep forever . <P> Death reached closer . He had to tell the captain : " He was lying in his hole , all curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of him . " Afterwards , he and the rest of the squad had to decide what to do with the last letter the man had written before the round dropped in on him . " Send it home . " said the chaplain , " his Mom will want to know what he was thinking before he died . " <P> The Why . The G.I. , like any other soldier , was afraid of death , which came suddenly , and always at the wrong time . A man in his company was blown up just after he got a telegram that told him he had a new son , his first . " The American soldier has only one fault , " said a platoon leader . " He has too much to live for . " Many men said : " I do n't want to be a hero , I just want to be alive . " Nevertheless , there were plenty of heroes before it was over . Not wanting to die , the G.I. newly on the line took a while to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he understood why a medic threw himself between a patient and a grenade . He understood the private who could have abandoned his hole , but stood up throwing back Chinese hand grenades before they exploded-until he misjudged one . And the corporal , with four bullets in his chest , who was told : " Take a stretcher ; you 'll die if you walk down . " " Yeah , " he replied , " send four guys back to carry me and they 'll all get clobbered . I 'll make it . " And he did . Those were the cool heroes , sacrificing themselves , not to " halt aggression " or " fight Communism , " but out of elemental loyalty to the outfit , and to the other men around them . <P> There was another kind of hero forged by the heat and pressure of battle . There was the private , foot all but blown off , chest punctured with machine-gun bullets , face mangled by a mortar chunk , who kept going until he got nearly to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fell down . There were the two Kentuckians who rushed up a hill screaming hillbilly songs and dived into a North Korean bunker with their hand grenades , blowing it up . There were also men who went to pieces in the strain of battle , and dashed forward , screaming and crying , to be cut down by the enemy . Other panic-stricken men " bugged out , " or groveled in their foxholes , clawing at the earth . He turned away and hoped that would not happen to him .
