In Johannesburg , a pudgy , sad-faced little Hindu unlimbered the weapon with which his father tumbled an empire . Manilal Gandhi , 60-year-old son of India 's revered Mahatma , was under sentence of $150 fine or 50 days in jail for his part in a deliberate protest violation of South Africa 's rigid race-segregation laws . Last week Manilal withdrew his appeal and surrendered to Transvaal police . Said he : " My rightful place as a self-respecting person is in prison ... By my voluntary sufferings , I seek to melt the hearts of the government . " <P> While Gandhi suffered . Prime Minister Daniel Malan , whose heart has a high melting point , pushed on with plans to abridge still further the liberties of South Africa 's nonwhites . Malan 's next great objective was to exclude Cape Province 's 49,000 voters of mixed blood from participation in " white " ' elections and to limit their political representation to four white M.P.s . Two of Malan 's schemes to achieve this had already been declared unconstitutional by South Africa 's appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher-politician called a joint session of the two houses of Parliament and tried to do the job constitutionally . But Parliament , for all its overwhelming sympathy with Malan 's racial policies , gave him 16 votes less than the two-thirds majority legally required for a constitutional change . <P> Though his Nationalist supporters howled with rage , Malan blandly turned to another tack . Next day Parliament was confronted with a bill which would make a Malan-packed subdivision of the appeal court the final authority on constitutional matters . If the new bill passes , single-minded Daniel Malan will be free to proceed against " colored " voters , secure in the knowledge that the reorganized appeal court will approve whatever action he cares to take .
