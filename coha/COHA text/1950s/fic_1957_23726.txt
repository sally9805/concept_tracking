the day it Rained Forever r H F hotel stood like a hollowed dry bone under the very center of the desert sky , ' here the sun burned the roof all day . All night , le memory of the sun stirred in every room like le ghost of an old forest fire . Long after dusk , nce light meant heat , the hotel lights stayed If . The inhabitants of the hotel preferred to . el their way blind through the halls in their ever-ending search for cool air . This one particular evening , Mr. Terle , the . oprietor , and his only boarders , Mr. Smith and : r . Fremley , who looked and smelled like two icient rags of cured tobacco , stayed late on the ng veranda . In their creaking glockenspiel ? kers , they gasped back and forth in the dark , ying to rock up a wind . " Mr. ' Eerie ... ? Would n't it be really nice .. . me day .. . if you could buy . . . air condiming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes shut . " Got no money for such things , Mr. Smith . " The two old boarders flushed ; they had n't paid bill now in twenty-one years . Much later , Mr. Fremley sighed a grievous -h . " Why , why do n't we all just quit , pick up , t outa here , move to a decent city ? Stop this elterin ' and fryin ' and sweatin ' . " ' Who 'd buy a dead hotel in a ghost town ? " d Mr. Terle , quietly . " No . No , we 'll just set re and wait , wait for that great day , January 1 . " Slowly , all three men stopped rocking . January 29th . The one day in all the year when it really let go , and rained . " Wo n't wait long . " Mr. Smith tilted his gold railroad watch like the warm summer moon in his palm . " Two hours and nine minutes from now it'II be January 29th . But I do n't see nary a cloud in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 29th since I was born ! " Mr. Terle stopped , surprised at his own loud voice . " If it 's a day late this year , I wo n't pull God 's shirt-tail . " Mr. Fremley swallowed hard , and looked from east to west across the desert toward the hills . " I wonder .. will here ever be a gold rush hereabouts , a ga in ? " " No gold , " said Mr. Smith . " And what 's more , I 'll make you a bet  --  no rain . No rain tomorrow , or the day after the day after tomorrow . No rain all the rest of this year . " The three old men sat staring at the big sun-yellowed moon that burned a hole in the high stillness . After a long while , painfully , they began to rock again . T H E first hot morning breeze curled the calendar pages like a dried snake skin against the flaking hotel front . The three men , thumbing their suspenders up over their hat rack shoulders came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " January 29th ... " " Not a drop of mercy there . " " Day 's young . " " I 'm not . " Mr. Fremley turned and went away . It took him five minutes to find his way up through the delirious hallways to his hot , freshly baked bed . At noon , Mr. Terle peered in . " Mr. Fremley . . . ? " " Damn desert cactus , that 's us ! " gasped Mr. Fremley , lying there , his face looking as if at any moment it might fall away in a blazing dust on the raw plank floor . " But even the best damn cactus got to have just a sip of water before it goes back to another year of the same damn furnace . I tell you , I wo n't move again , I 'll lie here an die if I do n't hear more than birds pattin ' around up on that roof ! " " Keep your prayers simple and your umbrella handy , " said Mr. Terle , and tiptoed away . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Fremley 's voice sang out mournfully from his bed . " Mr. Terle , that ai n't rain ! That 's you with the garden hose sprinklin ' well-water on the roof ! Thanks for tryin ' , but cut it out , now . " The pattering sound stopped . There was a sigh from the yard below . Coming around the side of the hotel a moment later , Mr. Terle saw the calendar fly out and down in the dust . " Damn January 29th ! " cried a voice . " Twelve more months ! Have to wait twelve more months , now ! " M R. SMITH was standing there in the doorway . He stepped inside and brought out two dilapidated suitcases and thumped them on the porch . " Mr. Smith ! " cried Mr. Terle . " You ca n't leave after thirty years ! " " They say it rains twenty days a month in Ireland , " said Mr. Smith . " I 'll get a job there and run around with my hat off and my mouth open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terle tried frantically to think of something ; he snapped his fingers . " You owe me nine thousand dollars rent ! " Mr. Smith recoiled ; his eyes got a look of tender and unexpected hurt in them . " I 'm sorry . " Mr. Terle looked away . " I did n't mean that . Look now  --  you just head for Seattle . Pours two inches a week there . Pay me when you MAGAZINE can , or never . But do me a favor : wait till mid night . it 's cooler then , anyhow . Get you a goon night 's walk toward the city . " " Nothing 'll happen between now and mid night . " " You got to have faith ! When everything els is gone , you got to believe a thing ' 11 happer Just stand here with me , you do n't have to si just stand here and think of rain . That 's th last thing I 'll ever ask of you . " On the desert , sudden little whirlwinds of dm twisted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset horizon . " kkrhat do I think ? Rain , oh you rain , con along here ? Stuff like that ? " " Anything . Anything at all ! " Mr. Smith stood for a long time between h two mangy suitcases and did not move . Five , s : minutes ticked by . There was no sound , save ti two men 's breathing in the dusk . Then at last , very firmly , Mr. Smith stoop ( to grasp the luggage handles . Just then , Mr. Tcrlc blinked . He leaned fc ward , cupping his hand to his ear . Mr. Smith froze , his hands still on the luggaE From away among the hills , a murmur , a sc and tremulous rumble . " Storm coming ! " hissed Mr. Terle . The sound grew louder ; a kind of whiti cloud rose up from the hills . Mr. Smith stood tall on tiptoes . Upstairs , Mr. Fremley sat up like Lazarus . Mr. Terle 's eyes grew wider and yet wider take hold of what was coming . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm-founder vessel feeling the first stir of some tropic bre . that smelled of lime and the ice-cool white m. of coconut . The smallest wind stroked over aching nostrils as over the flues of a white-I chimney . " There ! " cried Mr. Terle . " There ! " And over the last hill , shaking out feathers fiery dust , came the ' cloud , the thunder , racketing storm . V E R the hill , the first car to pass twenty days flung itself down the va with a shriek , a thud , and a wail . Mr. Terle did not dare to look at Mr. Sm Mr. Smith looked up , thinking of Mr. Fren in his room . Mr. Fremley , at the Window , looked down saw the car expire and die in front of the he For the sound that the car made was curio. final . It had come a very long way on bla ; sulphur roads , across salt flats abandoned " million years ago by the shingling off of waters . Now , with wire-ravelings like cannibal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canvas top thrown back and melted to spearmint gum over rear seat , the auto , a Kissel car , vintage 1924 , gave a final shuddering as if to expel its ghost upon the air . The old woman in the front seat of the car waited patiently , looking in at the three men and the hotel as if to say , " Forgive me , my friend is ill ; I 've known him a long while , and now I must see him through his final hour . " So she just sat in the car waiting for the faint convulsions to cease and for the great relaxation of all the hones which signifies that the final process is over . She must have sat a full half-minute longer listening to her car , and there was something so peaceful about her that Mr. Terle and Mr. Smith leaned slowly toward her . At last she looked at them with a grave snide and raised her hand . Mr. Fremley was surprised to see his hand go out the window , above , waving back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Strange . It 's not a storm . And I 'm not disappointed . How come ? " But Mr. Terle was down the path and to the car . " We thought you were . . . that is . . . " He trailed off . " Terle 's my name , Joe Terle . " She took his hand and looked at him with absolutely clear and unclouded light blue eyes like water that has melted from snow a thousand miles off and come a long way , purified by wind and sun . " Miss Blanche Hillgood , " she said , quietly . " Graduate of the Grinnell College , unmarried teacher of music , thirty years high-school glee club and student orchestra conductor , Green City , Iowa , twenty years private teacher of piano , harp , and voice , one month retired and living on a pension and now , taking my roots with me , on my way to California . " " Miss Hillgood , you do n't look to be going anywhere from here . " " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men circle the car , cautiously . She sat like a child on the lap of a rheumatic grandfather , undecided . " Is there nothing we can do ? " " Make a fence of the wheels , dinner gong of the brake drums ; the rest 'll make a fine rock garden . " Mr. Fremley shouted from the sky . " Dead ? I say , is the car dead ? I can feel it from here ! Well  --  it 's way past time for supper ! " Mr. Terle put out his hand . " Miss Hillgood , that there is Joe Terle 's Desert Hotel , open twenty-six hours a day . Gila monsters and road runners please register before going Upstairs . Get you a night 's sleep , free , we 'll knock our Ford off its blocks and drive you to the city come morning . " Site let herself be helped from the car . The machine groaned as if in protest at her going . She shut the dour carefully , with a soft click . " One friend gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could you please bring her in out of the weather ? " " Her , ma 'm ? " " Forgive me , I never think of things but what they 're people . The car was a man , I suppose , because it took me places . But a harp , now , do n't you agree , is female ? " She nodded to the rear seat of the car . There , tilted against the sky like an ancient scrolled leather ship-prow cleaving the wind , stood a case which towered above any driver who might sit up in front and sail the desert calms or the city traffics . " Mr. Smith , " said Mr. Terle . " Lend a hand . " They untied the huge case and hoisted it gingerly out between them , " What you got there ? " cried Mr. Frernley from above . Mr. Smith stumbled . Miss Hillgood gasped . The case shifted in the two men 's arms . From within the case came a faint musical humming . Mr. Fremley , above , heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he watched the lady and the two men and their boxed friend sway and vanish in the cavernous porch below . " Watch out ! " said Mr. Smith . " Some damn fool left his luggage here ? " He stopped . " Some damn fool ? Me . " The two men looked at each other . They were not perspiring any more . A wind had come up from somewhere , a gentle wind that fanned their shirt collars and flapped the strewn calendar gently in the dust . " My luggage . " said Mr. Smith . Then they all went inside . , 1M ORE wine , Miss Hillgood ? Ai n't had wine on the table in years . " " Just a touch , if you please . " They sat by the light of a single candle which made the room an oven and struck fire from the good silverware and the untracked plates as they talked and drank warm wine and ate . " Miss Hillgood , get on with your life . " " All my life , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beethoven to Bach to Brahms , I never noticed I was twenty-nine . Next time I looked up I was forty . Yesterday , seventy-one . Oh , there were men ; but they 'd given up singing at ten and given up flying when they were twelve . I always figured we were horn to fly , one way or other , so I could n't stand most men shuffling along with all the iron in the earth in their blood . I never met a man who weighed less than nine hundred pounds . In their black business suits , you could hear them roll by like funeral wagons . " . " So you flew away ? " " Just in my mind , Mr. Terle . It 's taken sixty years to make the final break . All that time I grabbed onto piccolos and flutes and violins because they make streams in the air , you know , like streams and rivers on the ground . I rode every tributary and tried every fresh-water wind from Handel on down to a whole slew of Strausses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me here . " " How 'd you finally make up your mind to leave ? " asked Mr. Smith . " I looked around last week and said , ' Why , look , you 've been flying alone ? No one in all Green City really cares if you fly or how high you go . ' It 's always , ' Fine , Blanche ' or ' Thanks for the recital at the PTA tea , Miss H. ' But no one really listening . And when I talked a long time ago about Chicago or New York , folks swatted site and laughed , ' Why he a little frog in a big pond when you can be the biggest frog in all Green City ! ' So I stayed on , while the folkswho gave me advice moved away or died or both . The rest had wax in their ears . Just last week I shook myself and said , ' Hold on ! Since when do frogs have wings ? ' " " So now you 're headin ' west ? " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that orchestra under the stars . But somewhere I just must play at last for someone who 'll hear and really listen .. They sat there in the warm dark . She was finished , she had said it all now , foolish or not  --  and she moved back quietly in her chair . Upstairs , someone coughed . Miss Hillgood heard , and rose . I T T 0 0 K Mr. Fremley a moment to ungum his eyelids and make out the shape of the woman bending down to place the tray by his rumpled bed . " What you all talking about down there just now ? " " I 'll come back later and tell you word for word , " said Miss Hillgood . " Eat now . The salad 's fine . " She moved to leave the room . He said , quickly , " You goin ' to stay ? " She stopped hall out the door and tried to trace the expression on his sweating face in the dark . He , in turn , could not see her mouth or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then went on down the stairs . " She must not 've heard me , " said Mr. Freniley . But he knew she had heard . Miss Hillgood crossed the downstairs lobby to fumble with the locks on the upright leather case . " I must pay you for my supper . " " On the house , " said Mr. Terle . " I must pay , " she said , and opened the case . There was a sudden flash of gold . The two men quickened in their chairs . They squinted at the little old woman standing beside the tremendous heart-shaped object which towered above her with its shining columbined pedestal atop which a calm Grecian face with antelope eyes looked serenely at them even as Miss Hillgood looked now . The two men shot each other the quickest and most startled of glances , as if each had guessed what might happen next . They hurried across the lobby , breathing hard , to sit on the very edge of the hot velvet lounge , wiping their faces with damp handkerchiefs . Miss Hillgood drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently back on her shoulder , and put her hands to the strings . Mr. Terle took a breath of fiery air and waited . A desert wind came suddenly along the porch outside , tilting the chairs so they rocked this way and that like boats on a pond at night . Mr. Fremley 's voice protested from above , " What 's goin ' on down there ? " And then Miss Hillgood moved her hands . Starting at the arch near her shoulder , she played her fingers out along the simple tapestry of wires toward the blind and beautiful stare of the Greek Goddess on her column , and then hack . Then , for a moment , she paused and let the sounds drift up through the baked lobby air and into all the empty rooms . If Mr. Fremley shouted , above , no one heard . FOr Mr. Terle and Mr. Smith were so busy jumping up to stand riven in the shadows , they heard nothing save the storming of their own hearts and the shocked rush of all the air in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of pure insanity , they stared at the two women there , the blind Muse proud on her golden pillar , and the seated one , gentle eyes closed , her small hands stretched forth on the air . Like a girl , they both thought wildly , like a ittle girl putting her hands out a window to reel what ? Why , of course , of course ! To feel the rain . The echo of the first shower vanished down emote causeways and roof-drains , Mr. Fremley , above , rose from ) called round by his ears . Miss Hillgood played . She played and it was n't a tune they knew at 11 , but it was a tune they had heard a thousand Imes in their long lives , words or not , melody or . ot . She played and each time her fingers moved , he rain fell pattering through the dark hotel . ' he rain fell cool at the open windows and the sin rinsed down the baked floorboards of the orch .

It washed le windows and laid the dust and filled the rain arrels and curtained the doors with headed treads that might part and whisper as you alked through . But more than anything , the . ft touch and coolness of it fell on Mr. Smith id Mr. Terle . Its gentle weight and pressure ( wed them down and down until it had seated em again . By its continuous budding and ickling on their faces , it made them shut up eir eyes and mouths and raise their hands to icld it away . Seated there , they felt their heads t slowly hack to let the rain fall where it ) uld . The flash flood lasted a minute , then faded away as the fingers trailed down the loom , let drop a few last bursts and squalls , and then stopped .

Mr. Terle and Mr. Smith opened their eyes to see those two miraculous women way over there across the lobby , somehow come through the storm untouched and dry . They trembled . They leaned forward as if they wished to speak . They looked helpless , not knowing what to do . A N D then a single sound from high in the hotel corridors drew their attention above and told them what to do . The sound came floating down , feebly , fluttering like a tired bird beating its ancient wings . The two men looked up and listened . It was the sound of Mr. Fremley . Mr. Fremley , in his room , applauding . It took five seconds for Mr. Terle to figure what it was . Then he nudged Mr. Smith and began , himself , to beat his palms together . The two men struck their hands in mighty explosions .
