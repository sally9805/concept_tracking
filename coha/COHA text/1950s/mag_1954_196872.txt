ALTHOUGH Paul Czanne is widely regarded as the father of modern painting , and Manhattan 's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is devoted to modern art , the Guggenheim has never owned a Czanne . When it finally got one , it got one of the best : the Clockmaker ( opposite ) , which will go on view next week along with 34 other recently acquired paintings . <P> Czanne ( 1839-1906 ) painted pictures that were meticulous approximations of what he saw in nature ; most of his contemporary critics thought them clumsy ( in fact they were the reverse ) and looked on Czanne as inept or else as something of a wild man . But he had great respect for the classical tradition . Once he said that his goal was to paint something " solid and durable like the art of the museums . " In the Clockmaker , painted at the height of his powers , he turned out a picture that is as solid and durable as anything done in the last 100 years . The portrait of a skilled and self-respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spirit , the picture harks back to Rembrandt ; in technique , it points forward to cubism . <P> The Clockmaker , which came from a private collection in Heidelberg and has never before been shown in the U.S. , was bought by the Guggenheim 's trustees on the advice of the museum 's new director , James Johnson Sweeney , a knowledgeable critic and an energetic man-about-museums ( he has arranged exhibitions in Venice , Paris , London and Sao Paulo , served as Director of Painting and Sculpture for Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art ) . When Sweeney took over the Guggenheim 18 months ago , it was a cultish temple of nonobjective art . Its paintings were mainly second-rate German abstractions which looked like the products of a well-sterilized laboratory . Enclosed in fat , silvered frames , they hung in an atmosphere of pearl-grey carpets and Bach suites dripping from hidden amplifiers . Sweeney changed all that . He found the storerooms filled with first-rate works by modern Europeans from Bonnard to Vuillard , hung them in brilliantly arranged rotating shows . The Guggenheim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames and the pictures hang at eye level , have space enough to strike the viewer with maximum effect . With these reforms-and acquisitions such as its new Czanne-the Guggenheim has become one of the U.S. 's best showcases of modern art .
