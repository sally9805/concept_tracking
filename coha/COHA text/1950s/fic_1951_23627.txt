Beyond Recall A Story by Joseph Stockwell Drawings by Aaron Sopher EED sat on the bench under the shed of the station 's single platform , gazing out across the vacant rails to where the sheet iron warehouse buckled and groaned in the sunlight . The glare caused his eyes to smart and he lowered them to the front of his coat , soiled and wrinkled from the sweatings and dryings of the past weeks . Two weeks in August were enough to wilt a suit of armor , he thought . Which is about what happened , he added , fingering the paste-board ticket in his pocket , wishing the train would come . By nightfall he could soak in his own tub and then dress clean and white and give this wreckage to Amy to throw away , if he felt like it . But there was scant comfort even in this . He was amazed that he felt abso-lutely no elation . He felt only heat and fatigue and mild outrage . He also felt quite old . Do n't be petulant , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Tap . He glanced up as a camp truck snarled around the side of the station and ground to a halt at the end of the platform . The tail gate banged down and a torrent of duffle bags flopped heavily into the dust . Then the men piled out and fastened the tail gate up , waving to the driver , not in friendly farewell , Reed thought , but rather with contemptuous satisfaction at being rid of him . The driver grinned and yelled some vulgarity to them as he pulled away , causing them to shout back wordlessly against the departing roar of the truck . They stood grouped about their luggage while one of their number collected money from his fellows and hastened away on Reed knew only too well what errand . The others shouldered their bags and advanced toward him down the platform . Reed recognized them as reserves from the camp processing center ; some in sweat-splotched new suntans , with the coarse ties loosely knotted at their throats , others in assorted civilian clothing , as disreputable as his own ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or early thirties . One of them , a small , cheerful-looking man who brought up the rear , might have been as old as forty . He moved with an air of ease and authority and his face and arms were so deeply burned by the sun that they blended with his damp tee shirt , giving the impression at a distance that he was naked above the waist . He smiled and nodded to Reed as he came up . Then he flipped his bag easily to the pavement and removed from it a manila envelope . Puzzled , Reed watched him walk away into the chalky gloom of the waiting room . The others dropped their bags and seated themselves . Reed felt their eyes briefly upon him , without interest . They lighted cigarettes , and sat gazing out across the heat-blurred rails at the warehouse , caught up in the universal ennui of those in transit . Reed shifted uncomfortably , feeling his coat pull loose from the adhering back of the bench . He started to get up and wander back into the station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , he thought , do soldiers make you nervous ? He glanced down the idle row of gum-chewing jaws . For heaven 's sake , stop it , he told himself , you sound like some ruptured bullfighter . He snorted and the dull eyes turned to peer at him , thinking something in the open magazine had amused him . Reed closed his eyes and sniffed ; Lord knows , none of us smell like lilies , he thought . After a while the compact , sunburned man came out of the station , followed by the green-visored station agent . They stood at the edge of the tracks with hands on hips , gazing down the right of way , laughing and talking quietly . In a moment they heard the hoarse distant tone of the whistle , then the clang of the cross-warnings . Then finally the tali locomotive thundered past . The men on the bench stood together , grappling with their luggage , as the dirty-windowed cars slowed before them . Reed shuffled forward in their midst , then followed their noisy passage up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he entered the coach he could see , between the white napkins of the seat backs , the soldiers crowding in the aisle , struggling their fat bags up into the narrow racks . The sunburned man moved among them , inducing civilians to change their places so that his detachment might have a block of seats together . Reed ducked into a seat at the rear of the car and placed his suitcase in the seat beside him , hoping he would be left alone . He looked through the dusty panes at the faded brick of the station , trying to shut out the unfocused roar of the talk up ahead . At last the train lurched forward ; the station slid past , then a series of shabby track-side houses , then the flat baked plains , a dry lifeless brown under the bright August glare . Then , far out over the shallow sweep of land , the sinister black sprawl of the camp , fading back in gridded rows across the long gentle rise , its flanking fields cumbered with squatting rows of trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the fence , leaving a tiny plume of dust in its wake , and Reed was caught in a swift , terrible grip of loneliness , and defensively he shifted his thoughts to Amy . He was somewhat shocked to find his loneliness was not for her . The camp receded slowly past and Reed removed his hat and leaned back in his seat , vaguely sad and troubled , thinking : What ails you ? Is n't this what you wanted ? You 've been reprieved from the gallows , that 's all . But no , that 's not apt ; there never was the gallows ' stigma . You 're a little moth , Reed , rejected by the candle flame . He shook his head and laughed softly to himself . He was faintly nauseated , and he opened his magazine and tried again to concentrate upon its pages . Poor Amy , he thought senselessly . Poor Amy . Poor old Amy . Gradually the rumble and sway and babble of talk lulled him into slumber . W HEN the conductor shook him awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the car . His forehead was painfully creased from the steel window frame , his mouth hot and dry . He walked the length of the rocking coach and drank a cup of the skull-chilling water , looking down the aisle at the soldiers sprawled sleeping in the seats . He shivered , his clothing clammy from the air-conditioning , then moved around the narrow corridor and brushed his way under the heavy green curtains into the men 's room There in the compartment the sunburned man in the tee shirt sat on the leather bench . Beside him , gazing morosely out of the window , was a red-headed , freckled man in new khakis , stiff and salt-ringed under the armpits from dried sweat , with staff-sergeant 's chevrons crudely sewn to the rolled-up sleeves . On the bench opposite sat a slender boy  --  Reed recognized him as the one who had collected the money at the end of the platform  --  who wore a religious medal pinned to his olive drab undershirt . His eyes seemed extraordinarily bright , peering at Reed over the rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rack overhead . On the filthy , paper-strewn floor , the snout of a bottle protruded from a brown paper bag . The sunburned man slapped the leather seat beside him , staring Reed full in the face . " Hello , " he said , smiling , the teeth shock-ingly white in the hard dark face , " wo n't you sit and have a drink with us ? " Reed felt an instant urge to refuse , then a moment later was surprised to find himself holding a paper cup while the man splashed whiskey carefully into it . The bright-eyed bby fetched him a cup of water from one of the lavatories . " Thanks , " Reed said , holding up the cup . The boy blushed . The staff-sergeant beside the window grunted a single tired syllable , his freckled chin resting in his red raw hand , gazing forlornly out across the creeping countryside . The sunburned man nodded by way of acknowledgement . " You 're the captain helped us clean the BOQ , are n't you ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey , remembering when he had seen the man before , on the day of his arrival , when the group of enlisted men , all in their still clean civvies , had trooped sullenly into the foul pine oven of the BOQ , gingerly bearing brooms and mops . Reed had been unpacking his bag onto the bare mattress of his cot , the first officer to arrive , and his conscience had goaded him into diminishing the hatred in their eyes by lustily wielding one of their brooms . The dark-burned man had been there that day . Reed did not remember the other two . Bread upon the waters , he thought . Your conscience has earned you a drink of hot whiskey . " That 's right , " he said . " Where you bound ? " " Home , " Reed said . The red-faced staff-sergeant turned to look at him . The sunburned man folded his hairy dark arms across his chest . " Bust the physical ? " he asked . Reed nodded . The staff-sergeant stared at him for a moment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . For some reason the boy across the way grinned foolishly . " I hope it 's nothing serious , " the sunburned man said . Reed lifted his closed fist and tapped his chest . " I had pneumonia last winter . I guess it did something to the machine . " There was a silence , and to break it he said ; " Where you people bound ? " He regretted it instantly , knowing they could put him in his place if they so desired . " The ? th , out at Camp ? , " the sunburned man said . Reed smiled faintly . " That used to be my outfit , " he said . The boy lighted up . " What regiment were you in , Captain ? " Reed felt the perfunctory usage of the title . " I had D Company of the ? rd. - " No kidding , " the boy said , " I was in K Company . " " Oh , did you know Nat Samuels ? " " The tall lieutenant with the glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ice and a tank ran over him outside of Haganau . That was right after I joined them . He was there since Sicily , I think . " " I know , " Reed said , shuddering slightly , " we went over in the same packet . " For a brief moment , Nat 's brutal death . was very much with them in the compartment . He lifted his cup to finish his drink , shaking his head as the sunburned man lifted the bottle from the floor . Yet he hesitated about going back to his seat in the coach . Far out across the windmill-dotted plain the black wall of a thunderstorm loomed chillingly on the horizon . " What do you do in civilian life , Captain ? " the sunburned man asked . " I teach . I teach history at the Normal . " " You like it ? " " Oh yes . Very much . " " Not many men say that about what they do . It 's good to hear . " " I was at State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite bench volunteered , smiling . Exactly , Reed thought ; short-haired and bright-eyed and fat- enough down the curve to preclude deferment . " What are you doing now , " he joked , " going back for more GI time ? " The boy grinned darkly . " I 'll have enough time to get a blanking Ph.D . if this goes on much longer . " They sat in silence while the countryside rolled by . The staff-sergeant beside the window solemnly lighted a cigarette . After a while the sun-darkened man beside Reed cleared his throat . " You married ? " " Yes , " Reed said , thinking of Amy and feeling a warmth as he said it . " Any kids ? " " No . One coming in October , though . " " Then I bet I know somebody wo n't be sorry they sent you home . " The sunburned man laughed gently . Reed MAGAZINE met his level eyes and they both smiled . " That would have been rough . " the man said . " That first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough . I got six . " He held up as many fingers and nodded emphatically . " What part of the country you from ? " Reed asked , chuckling . " East Tennessee . I own land up past Sevier-ville . " " Could n't you have got a deferment on the basis of that ? " " Maybe , " the man shrugged , " but I got a boy of eighteen , liable to the draft . With me gone with the reserves they 'll have to defer him to work the land . " He stared through the window at the moving flat land . " If the choice is mine I 'd a damned sight rather go myself than see him go . " His gaze shifted suddenly into Reed 's eyes . " Hell , Captain , you know how those little boys are . They 're gone before you get a chance to look at them in daylight . " Reed nodded thoughtfully . " Then , too , I ca n't see backing out . They did n't make anybody sign with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever cause . There 's no point trying to crawfish . " " I know , " Reed said . " Of course , I did n't mean to say . . . " " I know you did n't . " " My old lady raised seven kinds of hell , " the sunburned man said , hurrying to cover his embarrassment . " She claimed I was glad to get away again . " He stared at Reed . " Of course I was n't glad , you understand , but then again I could n't behave like I was sorry , either . She 'd catch me whistling , or romping with my boys , and then I 'd find her in the corner with her head under her apron , crying , saying I was glad to leave her . It was n't so , but they 're hard to convince . " Reed half-smiled , remembering Amy , big as a house , moving with ridiculous , heart-tearing clumsir ness to fling herself across the bed , sobbing so violently that he had feared she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark suspicion upon him . " Well , I know she 'll be glad to have you home , " the sunburned man said . " She nearly deafened me over the phone . " " I guess she 'll be down at the station to meet you , then . " - No , " Reed said , with an odd sense of satisfaction , " she knows I 'm coming , but she does n't know just when . " T HEY had another drink from the paper cups and then sat with their arms folded , gazing out across the dark patches of scrub oak to where the rain billowed toward them across the plain . Then suddenly they were in it and the window was blurred and streaked so that they could not see out and the light in the compartment was strangely bright and shifting . The staff-sergeant beside the window stared on as if he could still see through the water-filmed pane . The boy 's head lolled on his shoulders and he drooled on the front of his undershirt . Reed himself began to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor . He felt an enormous fellowship for the sunburned man at his side . They rode in silence for what seemed a long while . The man sighed and reached to the floor for the bottle . He poured the limp cups full . " They 're funny creatures , " he said absently . " They ca n't seem to see why a man might be content to go on and get it over with . " He peered intently at Reed . " Do n't think I 'm bragging that I can take much more . Lord knows if 1 can take any . ' What I mean is I 'll get a chance to see . " And that is what I will not get , Reed thought , feeling again the bright doubt of his own fear . Five long years , he thought , since the last black storm of combat ; yet the remembrance of it rasped terrifyingly immediate even now . You do n't start over with any fresh load of stamina , he thought . This man knows . You pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left then . And suddenly he knew and accepted the truth . It would have crushed you , Reed , like a hollow stone . The first good day would have finished you . The sunburned man leaned across Reed 's lap to grip the staff-sergeant powerfully by the knee . " Now old Chester here is going to go professional , ai n't you , Chester , so they wo n't be troubled tocome for you every time . " The man beside the window turned his red face to glare at them . " You got that right , " he said , the resentment burning in his pale eyes ; " they 'll never get me out of this son-of-a-bitch again . They 're going to take care of me , brother , I can guarantee you that ! " He nodded savagely , then turned his tear-filled eyes toward the rain-streaked window and past it to where the wet scrub oaks were whipping past in the gathering twilight . The boy sighed in his sleep and slumped sidewise across the leather seat . The sunburned man chuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , sipping from the frayed paper cups , staring through the window as darkness enfolded them . Far out beyond the horizon , Venus blinked brightly through the intervening space . Finally the sunburned man spoke again . " You know , it seems like such a hell of a while , does n't it ? More than any five years . I could never figure how they were going to get things lined up so quick . " He leaned back in the seat and sipped from his paper cup . But it sure looks like they have gone and done it , " he added dreamily . 1 T HAD become almost totally dark and in the gloom Reed perceived familiar objects flitting by and he knew he was nearing home . He was ashamed ; ashamed to debark upon those peaceful streets , ashamed to stride home beneath the dusty trees to his pregnant Amy , to eat his hot dinner and take his hot bath , and then dress clean and white . And tomorrow disillusion his freshmen with his return . He smiled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch and stare into space again , starting tomorrow . And through the night the train would bear to his old and honored division certain soldiers . This boy sleeping on the leather couch in his undershirt ; he might or might not be good , for all that Reed had seen a Bronze Star pinned to the shirt which hung limply from the rack overhead . That could mean something , or it could mean nothing at all . The bright-eyed boys were not usually good , although it occurred to Reed that it was no longer his concern to speculate upon this boy 's goodness or his badness . He no longer had that right ; some secret murmur in the chambers of his heart had deprived him of that right and that responsibility . As for the staff beside tke window , it was hard to tell . Sometimes such a malcontent could be splendid , if all that bitterness could be profitably channeled . The darkly burned man on his right would probably make somebody the best platoon sergeant in the whole wide Army . And Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy and water his lawn when the sun goes down . The first lights of town came gliding past and Reed rose to his feet . The lights in the car came on suddenly and blindingly . The boy rose up on the leather bench and rubbed his eyes . Reed was embarrassed . " You boys take it easy , " he said . " I wish you a world of luck . " The staff-sergeant in the corner made a sound that was either grunt or sob , still staring sightlessly out into the night . The boy took his fists from his eyes long enough to grin and flip a half-mocking salute . The sunburned man stood and grasped Reed 's hand with strength . " Good-by and good luck to you , Captain . I hope your wife gets you a fine big boy . " Reed held the hand and gazed into the dark level eyes . He knew that this man could endure whatever might come as well as any man . There was no point in undergoing the embarrassment of exchanging names and addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you drew from them . Then they were gone . And that was all .
