The 40 million U.S. car owners who already spend $3 billion yearly on auto liability insurance will soon have to pay about $400 million more . Speaking for three of the biggest casualty companies-State Farm Mutual , Allstate . Nationwide Mutual-General Manager Vestal Lemmon of the National Association of Independent Insurers said : " Before the end of the year the western half of the country will see substantial increases . It may be the second quarter of 1957 before they get to the eastern areas . " Another top rate-making group , the National Bureau of Casualty Underwriters ( Aetna Casualty , Travelers , U.S. Fidelity &; Guaranty ) , had already tipped its hand with a request for a 23% increase in Oklahoma . <P> <P> The companies say that very few of them are making money this year . In 1956 , despite an overall premium increase , the companies are heading into the red . State Farm Mutual , No. 1 U.S. auto insurance company ( 4,600,000 policies ) expects to wind up with a $7 million to $10 million operating loss ( v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sears , Roebuck ) , just broke even in the first half of 1956 ( v. an $11 million underwriting profit last year ) . <P> Generous Juries . The industry loss stemmed from the gain in highway accidents , which so far in 1956 added up to 8% more fatalities , 5% to 10% more accidents . But the accident increase only started the process ; it is what happens after the accident that has caused most of the skyrocketing costs . The price of repairing battered cars and compensating maimed humans has shot up ; claims now cost an average 41% more to settle than they did five years ago . A smashed fender that once could be replaced by a simple , curved piece of metal now involves large molded panels with sculptured lights . The bumper that cost $5 in 1940 now costs $20 . In the good old days of divided windshields , the company could put in a new unit for $25 . Adjusters expect the 1957 wraparound type will cost around $125 . State Farm Vice President Thomas Morrill says that windshield replacements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adds : " Many people , as soon as they get a little nick in the windshield , rush out and get a new one . There are a lot of nicks in windshields these days , and the problem of glass breakage is becoming acute . " Two-toned paint jobs , rear ends that have reared up into expensive units , swooping chrome , power brakes and steering , windows and seats-all these have increased body repair costs . <P> Juries , particularly soft-hearted where the insurance companies pay the bill , have upped accident awards for personal injuries from an average of $3,490 to $11,576 , or 231% since 1940 ; since mid-1955 alone , Nationwide has experienced a 43% rise in jury judgments . In ten years the highest verdict awarded in Los Angeles jumped from $33,000 to $156,000 ; there are instances of awards of $86,000 for a broken hip , $100,000 for losing a toe . Insurance companies find themselves increasingly liable for such ephemeral damages as plaintiffs ' mental anguish , e.g. , a Southwestern woman who merely witnessed an auto accident that left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $90,000 on the claim ( disputed by two eminent obstetricians ) that the sight caused her to have a miscarriage.
