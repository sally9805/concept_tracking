This week Vice President Alben William Barkley will step up on the rostrum of the U.S. Senate with his gavel , and the 83rd Congress will come to order . The Senate and the House will organize , and then will begin a resolute fortnight of shadow boxing . <P> In its first days , the Republican 83rd will receive a series of messages from President Harry Truman . His remarks on the way out are expected to extol the Democratic record , challenge the Republicans to do what he wants-and produce little , if any , result . The Congress will be waiting for another series of messages : the program Dwight Eisenhower will outline after he is inaugurated . <P> None &; Nine . The 83rd will be the first Republican Congress in 24 years to organize under a G.O.P. President . None of the 48 Republicans in the Senate and only nine- of the 221 in the House have ever served under a President from their own party . In this unaccustomed role , the Republicans of the 83rd will not arrive in Washington bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in behind the new President . After Jan. 20 , he is expected to go before Congress personally to present his program . Among the major problems Congress will have to buckle down to after it hears him : APPROPRIATIONS . What to do about the budget for fiscal 1954 which Harry Truman will leave behind . Eisenhower is anxious to cut expenditures , and a number of G.O.P. leaders , including House Majority Leader-to-be Charles Halleck of Indiana , have called economy the most important issue facing the new Congress . <P> <P> TAXES . The excess profits tax ( $2.5 billion a year ) expires June 30 , and individual income taxes are due to cut back an average of 11% ( $2.9 billion ) automatically at the end of 1953 . Congress will want to cut taxes , but many a top Republican thinks the budget should be balanced first . <P> CONTROLS . Republican leaders want to drop price and wage controls as soon as possible , but they aim to study the problem carefully . <P> FOREIGN AID . A close , new look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote trade rather than aid . <P> LABOR . The Taft-Hartley law will have to be dealt with . There are signs that this issue may not be explosive . In 1949 , Senator Taft agreed to 28 clarifying amendments , but labor then was fighting for outright repeal as a symbolic goal . Last week A.F.L. President George Meany , filled with what seemed to be a cooperative spirit , said he is now willing to settle for amendment rather than repeal . <P> TARIFFS . The reciprocal trade agreements act expires in June . Tariff reduction will be more important than ever , in view of the " trade rather than aid " emphasis in foreign policy . <P> CIVIL RIGHTS . The hot civil rights question may come up on the first day . Minnesota 's Senator Hubert Humphrey is planning to call for a new set of rules outlawing the filibuster , the Southern Democrats ' chief weapon in dry-docking civil rights legislation . <P> TIDELANDS . The President-elect has said he will sign a bill returning the tidelands to the states . The Congress , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vetoed by Truman , is almost certain to produce a new bill for signing .
