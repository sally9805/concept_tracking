( See Cover ) <P> On an oval test track outside South Bend , Ind. , a red-and-cream Studebaker hard top whisked along the straightaway . It swept into a steeply banked curve , worked up to the outer edge and hung there as it rounded the turn with hardly any slackening of speed . Then , like a dive bomber peeling off for attack , it whipped out of the turn and shot into the straightaway again . Around &; around the three-mile track the car whirled , hour after hour . Average speed for eight hours : 75 m.p.h . <P> After the speed tests came the stability tests ; at high speed , the test driver twisted the wheel hard left . The tires squealed as the car rocked far over and skidded around . Then came scores of other tests . The car was sent hurtling around right-angle turns , driven over cunningly contrived bumps that jarred the teeth of the driver ( and would have thrown a less-skilled man into the ditch ) . It was sent splashing through a shallow tank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in well-shrouded secrecy , until it had piled up more than 100,000 miles . Not till then did Studebaker Corp . engineers feel that they had worked all the bugs out of its 1953 car . <P> Secret Out . This week , in showrooms across the nation , it went on display . Long , low and racy , the new model is a completely new breed of car , radically different from anything ever mass-produced in the U.S. It combines the low-slung beauty , sporty look and most of the road-holding qualities of European sports cars with some of the comfort and most of the durability of the American family car . <P> The new Studebaker is the biggest design gamble in the auto industry since Chrysler 's Airflow ( which was a flop ) , a test to see whether Americans will buy a semi-sports car in big quantities . In its gamble , Studebaker staked $27 million for new tools , sure that the growing interest in sports cars indicates an entirely new trend in U.S. auto design . From Belgium 's annual auto show in Brussels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came the first evidence that the bet might pay off . Alongside the fanciest cars of Europe and 20 U.S. makes , the Studebaker was the sensation of the show . " Revolutionary , " " spectacular , " " beautiful , " reported the press . Said Roger Darteyre , auto reporter of Le Soir , Belgium 's largest daily , and technical expert for the Belgian Royal Automobile Club : " The Studebaker is the best thing America has done in low suspension ... So far as construction and design are concerned , it 's the foremost achievement among American cars . " <P> Studebaker 's Chairman and President Harold Sines Vance , whose conservative clothes and serious mien make him seem as out of place in a sports car as a minister on a merry-go-round , was quietly confident this week that his new car would be just as much of a sensation in the U.S. Said he : " We expect to sell at least 150,000 more cars this year than last , the greatest number in our history , and boost our total share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
