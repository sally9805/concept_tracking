A Story by BEN MADDOW Drawings by Janina Donzanska An Old Boy who made Violins I SAW a man smiling while my daughter screamed , and he came across the little refugee restaurant and opened his hand , which was plated thick with calluses , and gave her a lemon drop . She stopped yelling , out of politeness . He was a wonderful old man , with eyes of palest innocence , though his face was pink . as if lie were perpetually angry . " No need to cry , " he told Rachel . She said to him , " He always gives me meat for dinner . " " What a crime ! " I said bitterly . She wiped her nose into her pretty sleeve . " It has fat on it . " " I cut all the fat off , " I said . " He does n't love me , " Rachel told the man . " He does n't even like me. " " 0 ' course he does . He 's got papa , " said the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists , with their sparse white fur , planted solidly among the frivolous refugee dishes . " Name 's McIntyre , " he added . " Wopper , " I said . " George K. Wopper . " " Why , funny , there 's a Wopper in Nootka Bay , Oregon , my home town . Never liked ' em , though . Kept chickens and fought the zoning law . How old would you say I was ? " he asked . I was cruel . I guessed sixty-five , said seventy . " Eighty-one , " he said in habitual triumph . " Been retired seventeen short years . Went by like a flash . Mechanical engineer . You in business , Mr. Wopper ? " " Shoes . " " Wait a minute ! Let me talk ! " said Rachel . " I 'm four and one-half , my brother is Robert , he 's away at a silly old camp ! My mother took off and went to get him ! He has the biggest feet ! I love him but he wo n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks I 'm a pest ! I 'm not , am I ? " " You 're my darling , " he told her . He gave her another lemon drop and went back to his table . Rachel crunched both candies at once in her noisy teeth , then knocked over her glass of milk . Two waiters and a bus boy came with mops and smiles . The whole restaurant smiled ; why should n't they ? ? the milk was n't in their lap . Still , 1 forbore to scold her . She was rather disappointed , I think . " Eat your chop , honey , or no dessert , " I said . Rachel put her thumb in her mouth , closed her eyes in an exaggerated way , and leaned  --  fell , rather  --  from her chair onto my chest . I kissed her and signaled for the bill . We went out past the old man and walked hand in hand on the thick lawns . It was a broad , elegant park along the harbor . We were on the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . I had driven all the way from Frisco here to Vancouver : sea , headland , forest , Mt . Shasta ghostly in the rain . Landscape made me happy , made Rachel sleepy . " I do n't know what to do , " she said . " Too bad , " I said . The sun was low and salmon-red . The air had the mild Canadian brilliance . To one side was the new bridge to the city : painted steel stretched over green salt water . Closer by , cemented into the grass , was a transplanted cedar pole , almost sixty feet high , carved and painted . It was all beaks , eyes , claws , teeth , the bloody and ritual jaw of cannibalism . A good way off , the old man had come out of the restaurant and was shading his eyes to look at the monument . " I really love him , " said Rachel . " Who ? Bobbie ? " " You know who ! Not Bobbie ! Not Bobbie ! " she screamed . Tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nostrils . She was in a horrible rage . Old - McIntyre came toward us from behind and took Rachel by the elbows and swept her off the ground . " Grandpa ! " she said to him , rather sadly . Pleased at this new name , he put her on his shoulders and carried her to the base of the totem pole . He raised one hand , Indian fashion , and said , " How ! " Some tourists in new Scotch plaid berets took their picture . There was a lot of women 's laughter in the soft , moist air . " Injuns made this pole , " he said to Rachel . " Pretty good , ai n't they ? I do a little carving myself . " And he took her for a piggy-hack ride . I sat on the grass and smoked a cigar . People generally were charmed by Rachel , in public , anyway . I was proud of that ; also it gave me a brief rest : the old , lonely , and yet comfortable feeling that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a front lawn and fruit trees and a house with radiant heat , without income and without income tax . A S I leaned back in the grassy fragrance and had this little backward dream , Rachel came running toward me , and took off her scarf , sticky with old chocolate , and wrapped it around my head . " You 're so cold , " she said . I rocked her in my lap . The old man followed on his short sprightly legs , and stood over me with benevolence . " Shoes are a good line , " he assured me . " There 's a steady demand for shoes . " He smiled . " Most people have at least two feet . " Rachel laughed her head off at this joke . I said , " How do you spend your time , Mr. McIntyre ? " " You would hardly believe it , sir , " the old boy said . He laughed , crowed almost . " I make violins . That 's the last two years . Before that , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a strain in my neck to have to look up at him , and to nod and smile encouragement . It was pity or guilt ; that I was half his age ; that I could feel the creak of his bony muscles , the thick blood moving through hard and brittle veins in his head , and his slow , padded hands twisting as he talked , the great callus flaking in the center of each palm , and every finger blunt as a thumb . " Few years ago 1 made a working steam engine for my grandson . Only this high  --  you could stow it away in an apple box . He did n't like it at all . Cried when he saw it . " " It must have been scary , " Rachel said . " Chu-chu , chu-chu , chu ! " answered Mr. McIntyre . " Well , sir , 1 thought , what next ? Reach a certain age , the world is open . No obligation to anybody but the Lord . I had all my tools , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . Concrete floor . Built it myself in ' 07 . Well , I sat in that basement and puttered with my tools and waited around to die . And a feller dropped in one day ? " I offered him a cigar ; he took it , said he 'd save it for his grandson , who was Chief of Police at Nootka Bay . First the grandson was afraid of my steam engines , he said , and suddenly he was Chief of Police ; time was frightening . " Feller dropped in , " he continued .

Broken bridge . Heard I had some tools . Well , I repaired it for him , and it got me interested in fiddles . My wife plays piano , you know , or did till she up and left me . " " After all those years ? " I said . " Why ? " " Gall bladder , " he told me . " Went just like that . " He clapped his hands . Rachel stared at him . Everything he did was dramatic , in a dry way . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought the blueprints of the Stradivarius violin of 16 and 59 . I had to send for wood to the country of Germany . Aged two hundred years in a cool room . I studied that wood for three solid weeks . Day after Thanksgiving I took a ribbon saw and cut out the back and the front and sanded it down so fine it looked like it been waxed . And went over it with a dial micrometer . Yes , I did , honey , " he said , kissing Rachel . " Little papoose . " As he bent down , I could smell the bourbon . Suddenly I knew I detested the old boy , though I could n't make myself get up off the grass , and say a cold good-by , take Rachel , and leave him to his gab and his blarney . I was imprisoned , not by pity any more , but by some affectionate force in the old man , in his violent pink face and his eyes blue as a baby 's . " Lot of work entailed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worker , " he agreed . " Put front and back of that violin in a clamp lined with Iamb 's wool , and rubbed some rosin along the edges , and I 'm no player at all , my wife took the music out of me when she passed , but I bought an old violin bow and I stroked the back and I stroked the front , and listened to the note and got ' cm in harmony . Harmony , mind your ' he cried in his technical joy . " And where it was out of harmony , I gave a lick with four-zero sandpaper , and 1 stroked , I stroked it from and back . And when it was ready I clapped it together ? " " What  --  no glue ? " I said . " Pure horse 's hoof , " he said . " None of your cheap plastic . And I took that violin to Mr. Sidney Helmholtz in San Francisco and he said to me , Mr. McIntyre , you 're no amateur . Told me , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the most eminent , mind you , fiddle-maker in America . I got $1,800 for that instrument . And I ca n't play a note . That fiddle will go on symphonizing away when I am nailed up for good and moldering in my hundred-dollar coffin . Immortality . Ai n't that highlarious ? ? Ah ! " he said to Rachel , turning her about to look at the great Indian pole , " there 's a piece of cake you ca n't do with a micrometer , hey girl ? " Rachel sprang up and clasped him about the knees in a wave of passion . He implored us to come and visit him in Nootka Bay , Oregon . He had bags full of candy in glass jars , he assured us . And dozens of violins . It grew darker quite slowly . We felt the chill creep down from invisible glaciers ; but we stood about , Rachel and I , listening to the old boy , the charmer , the magician with the alcoholic skin . At a little distance the totem pole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned black and glittering in the flood of the supernatural moon . 0 N MONDAY , on our way home , four days later , I drove past a road sign which mentioned Nootka Bay , thirty miles to the west . The inertia of the moving road took inc miles beyond this notice , and then it seemed impossible to turn the car around and go back . Fifty miles Later , between the stones of a bad detour , 1 Blew the left front tire and rolled down a long hill into a local garage for repair . It had begun to rain in drops as thick as oil . We gave up , and picked a motel ; it had accommodations in the shape of wigwams of poured concrete . I put Rachel to bed early , so we could be up at dawn and home by afternoon , I remember there was the awful vibration of a power plant in the hills nearby . I fell asleep in my socks , and woke up about eleven in the evening . It was stifling inside . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain , pine , and clams . We were closer to the ocean than I thought . The old boy would be home in Nootka Bay by now . I decided to shave . In a horrible fluorescent light , I ran water and scraped at my face , that naked sign of a man that stands for the rest of him . " Holy cats , I 'm doing pretty well , " I assured myself . " Business highly competitive , but I can stand the gaff . " I pounded my chest . " Two kids , boy and girl , wifie the best in the world , what 's your complaint , man ? " I asked the mirror . " That little joyride with the girl in Shipping , well a man of forty plus ca n't throw away a zoftik chance like that , what the hell do you want ? You tried a hobby , but no go . Damn it to hell ? " for I had cut a nick over that slight excrescence in my left chin , and it was bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the pictures looked like fried liver , all evening cooped up in a darkroom , who wants it ? Sailboats , I bought a beauty , it . made the wife sick as a dog , and at present , I concentrate on golf . But what 's golf ? Knock around a defenseless little white ball for three hours every Sunday ? Grown men , it 's a form of lunacy . Well , what do you want ? You wrote sonnets to a married woman when you were twenty years of age , but you 're a big boy now , George , you big handsome fool , " I said , patting the slash on my chin with a dry towel , " so will you please tell me or somebody , anybody , tell me , what is this game all about , how corny ran you get ? " I turned out the lights and went hack to bed . The truth was this : I was happy , but dissatisfied . Old McIntyre had his immortal violins ; the same could not be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awoke me . It was past three in the morning . She sat up and screamed ; she was having one of those standard nightmares , typical for her age . You would think the kid could read Gesell . I held her in my arms . She hit me and struggled against me MAGAZINE with all her force . It was mad and frightening , Her eyes wide open , her spine stiff and her skin trembling and cold , she screamed she wanted her Daddy , Daddy , where was her Daddy ? She also remarked that she did n't mean to kill Bobbie , it was an accident , it was , it was , was n't it ? I tried to get her to eat a peppermint , but she spit it out as though it were poison . After ten minutes of this , she cried real , waking tears , and went to the toilet , myself holding her by the hand as she sat , mournful and talkative , afraid to go back to the sinister house of sleep . I sang her all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both quiet , sleepy , and sad . Rachel said she wanted to visit Grandpa McIntyre , and I found myself in agreement . He had the secret , the old boy ; and we had to see him , both Rachel and I , two children with the vacation running out . W H E N we got to Nootka Bay , there were twenty Mclntyres in the phone book , and I realized I did n't know the old man 's first name . I had a brilliant notion , and called the Chief of Police . Our parents were afraid of telegrams . Each century has its own mortal conventions . Bad news , in our time , always comes by phone . Black mouthpiece , funereal plastic , the ceremonial words . " The old boy passed on , " said the Chief of Police . He seemed oddly unaffected . " It happened on the plane from Vancouver . He was reading a paper . Did n't like the news , I guess . He would have been eighty-two in December . You a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We all pass on , " he told me . " I wonder , " I said without thinking , " if I could buy one of his violins from the estate , " " You could if there were any . Man alive ! " he said . " What kind of story did he tell you ? " " Said he made several dozen violins . In the basement of his house . " " The old boy tell you that ? I 'll be darned ! You know , sir , he fooled many a person . Quite a boy . My Grandpa McIntyre was well-known for his lies , well-known ! Respected , you might almost say . Never made a violin in his life . Why should he ? " I thanked him . We went and had a big lunch . The old faker ! 1 felt some sort of triumph . Eating her chocolate pudding , Rachel began to cry . " We forgot to see my grandpa , " she said . " He 's not your real grandpa , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , lives on Miller Street . You know that . You know that perfectly well , now do n't you ? God damn it ! " his woman 's forehead and crooked nose , Jeffer- " What happened to this grandpa ? " she whis son with the black concentration in his eyes , pered . She was pleased by my irrational anger . and some dozen others I could n't recognize till " He 's not here , " I told her . " He 's gone . " I saw the names chiseled into the base : the two " I know it , " she said . In a cemetery . Where Adamses , Monroe , Jackson , Tyler , Polk , and the they put your old bones . Bobbie told me all that rest . The old man had begun the series of the stuff . I do n't want to die . " But she thought no Presidents , and was only half-way through .

The man at in heaven or hell . Abe Lincoln was the master- the post office told us the McIntyre place was piece , The hard strokes of steel tools had up there on the hill , the fanciest house in hacked him out of a knot of myrtle . A print Nootka Bay . It was ornate , in fact , but time had was tacked to the wall , a magazine reproduction made it sober . Rain clouds were reflected in of an old Lincoln photo , showing the marks the mysterious , flawed window glass of the early where the glass plate had cracked ; and copying century . it and surpassing it in the sculptured head , the I pushed open a slant wooden door under a same crooked how-tie , the checks incised with thick hydrangea , and saw , as I guessed , the history , the large melancholy eyes , careless hair , gloom of the big cement cellar .
