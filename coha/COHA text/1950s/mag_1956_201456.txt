Just as on Broadway , My Fair Lady is a smash hit of the record industry . On the market for nine weeks , Columbia Records had shipped some 200,000 LP recordings of the show ( list price : $4.98 ) by the end of last week , and orders were coming in at a joyous rate of some 10,000 a day-or at about the clip of a good-selling pop single . Equally gratifying to showfolk was the advance order for two versions , single LP and big ( 3 LP ) album , of Broadway 's latest hit musical . The Most Happy Fella , which , at more than $500,000 , was even bigger than My Fair Lady 's had been . The figures added up to robust new evidence that the recorded <P> Broadway musical has come into its own as a mass-entertainment medium , as important to U.S. listeners as opera is to Italians , a kind of repertory theater of the ear . <P> <P> The two albums represent the two current extremes of show styles : Lady is a descendant of Oklahoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by plenty of action and dialogue . Fella comes from Italian opera buffa out of such frankly operatic efforts as Porgy and Bess - only 20 of its 140 minutes are filled with spoken words , a percentage which compares favorably with Mozart 's Magic Flute . Putting such works on records required very special abilities , e.g. , coaxing people whose first impulse is to mime and pose into playing entirely for the ear , and then creating in sound the invisible stage action and mood . <P> <P> Producer of these two recordings was Columbia 's new President Goddard Lieberson ( TIME , Oct. u , 1954 ) . Sitting behind the control-room glass in cotton jersey and slacks , he rolled in his chair , clutched his brow , his breast , his colleagues ' arms , while demanding one take after another . His problem with Fella was simplified by the fact that the nearly continual music supplied almost all the required atmosphere , from the rowdy , Italianate folk-type songs to the entr'acte hit , Standing on the Corner , to the show 's one deeply felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a moment when he feared it was beginning to sound pat as a TV program , so he halted for a playback , to get everything in playing order again . The Lady recording , on the other hand , contains all the songs but little of the dramatic action with which to recreate Bernard Shaw 's famed Pygmalion ( on which the show is based ) . To suggest the belligerent action of Just You Wait , ' Enery ' Iggins , Producer Lieberson added a drum roll under Julie Andrews ' vocal ; for the poignance of Rex Harrison 's acting during I 've Grown Accustomed to Her Face , he added a solo violin playing the tune . The resulting record has an atmosphere all its own and is a delight to the ear-even if the eye must go without the show 's magnificent appearance .
