Manhattan 's Met has been talking about a new opera house , off &; on , for 27 years . Last week , with deep restraint , the Met announced that it was actually mulling a rough plan . The plan , first proposed by city officials last spring : build a new Metropolitan Opera House as part of a general face-lifting project for Manhattan 's Columbus Circle . George Sloan , Met board chairman , announced that the board now has a pledge ( pledger unnamed ) for 40% of the land cost ( about $1,250,000 ) , said he was confident the remaining 60% could be raised . Next question : Where to get $15 million for a new opera house ? <P> There will be no public fund drive until at least a third of the $15 million has been raised privately , said Sloan . Since that may take a long time , plans are still little beyond the dream stage . Nonetheless , the Met is busy dreaming .               @ @ @ @ @ @
