How Often Are They Right ? <P> ECONOMIC forecasters trace their ancestry to a 16th century astrologer who was hired to prophesy financial trends for the German banking house of Fugger . The art of business prediction has come a long way from its starry-eyed origins . But economists admit readily that their prognostications are still largely a matter of educated guesswork . And in the current uncertainty over the economic outlook , guesstimating fever has reached epidemic pitch . Says one topflight Washington economist : " We work by the seat of our pants more often than we like to admit . " <P> How good are the forecasters ? In recent years , even the best prophets have been caught with the seat of their pants down . As late as 1945 and 1946 , most business analysts insisted that World War 11 , like every other major conflict since Napoleon 's day , would be followed by a depression . They failed to take into account the huge backlog of buying power behind bottled-up wartime shortages . Many of them underestimated the 1953 boom ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the U.S. hummed into an alltime record year , eight economists at a congressional hearing foresaw only a slight pickup from 1954 . At the start of 1956 , almost all economists were correct in predicting that business would be good for 1956 's first half . However , said the University of Pennsylvania 's Irwin Friend , the signs were so plain that " only a very silly forecast could have been wrong . " <P> Despite the errors , the broad , long-term predictions have been far closer to target today than they were in the pre-World War II period . Major reason is the ever-increasing range and volume of information on the econ omy . As chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , Arthur Burns has greatly speeded the flow of vital statistics from marketplace to slide rule ; e.g. , housing trends , long forecast by the volume of construction starts , are now tracked months earlier on the basis of mortgage applications . Burns helped devise two of the profession 's widely used yardsticks while director of the august National Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series on the U.S. economy , Burns 's staff picked 21 key indicators , business failures , durable-goods orders , etc. that faithfully pace business shifts . Under Burns the National Bureau also perfected the " diffusion index , " a cross section of indicators used to gauge the strength of an upswing or downturn .
