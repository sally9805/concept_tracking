El Ciudadano ( The Citizen ) is published occasionally , without official sanction , by Argentina 's opposition Radical Party . Last week El Ciudadano hit Buenos Aires newsstands with a story that sold 40,000 copies to goggle-eyed citizens before police confiscated the rest of the edition . Its gist : Pern has formed a private militia from the ranks of his General Confederation of Labor ( C.G.T. ) , and is preparing to arm it to the teeth . <P> According to information that the Radicals have been gathering for months , Pern decided last year , about two months before top army officers vetoed his plan to make his wife Vice President , that he needed some sort of militia or storm-trooper organization . The President himself drew up a confidential " Workers ' Defense Plan " to " defend the government in the event of military action against it . " Five thousand descamisados of " absolute confidence " were enrolled , divided into " shock troop " detachments , " special mission " units and " reserves . " <P> Strategic Zones . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ' interests against possible capitalist reaction , " listed as " strategic zones " all rail and bus stations , ports , communications centers , power plants , food warehouses , waterworks , public markets , government offices , union headquarters , theaters and stadiums . Said its Article Four : " We do not mean to meet the enemy in open fight but to ... neutralize him by attacking where he is weakest . " <P> The new Pernista militia got its first important workout during last September 's abortive military uprising . C.G.T . Boss Jos Espejo shouted the radio alarm . On cue , workers rushed to the presidential palace ; in the suburbs drivers jammed their big diesel buses across roads by which troops or tanks might have moved on the capital . After the revolt was snuffed out , " special mission ' ' groups of workers ' militia swung briskly into action , rounding up and arresting suspects , running spot checks for illegal arms . <P> Lethal Toys . So successful was this first trial run that it was decided to improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very confidential " letters , dated last December , in which the Argentine firm of Ballester Molina contracted to deliver , for $580,000. a consignment of 5,000 automatic pistols and 2,000 carbines to the Eva Pern Social Aid Foundation . El Ciudadano somberly pointed out that such toys were obviously not for Senora Pern 's famed Children 's Village , nor for her junior soccer tournament . <P> Eight days later , before a crowd of 20,000 in Buenos Aires ' Plaza Constitution , El Ciudadano 's Editor Francisco H. Uzal repeated the story . " There can be no doubt that these guns are meant for the C.G.T. ! " he shouted . As Uzal walked off the speaker 's platform , two federal policemen met him and led him away through the crowd to jail .
