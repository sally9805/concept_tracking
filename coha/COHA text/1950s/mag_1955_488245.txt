This is the second of a three-part guest editorial , the concluding portion of which will appear in an early issue . Mr. Snow , a foreign correspondent in Europe and Asia for more than twenty years , is the author of " The Battle for Asia , " " Pattern of Soviet Power , " and other books . IS THE HISTORY of empire in Africa going to repeat the same broad pattern of decline and exit to the tune of social revolution , as in Asia ? That depends , naturally , on what the European does with his remaining opportunities there . His stake is greater ; in South Africa alone some 2,500,000 white settlers call the black land their home . And yet it is just there that the white man 's future in Africa looks most uncertain , 4A7/14.1P h ; e rne , rn1 res e n.e where the portents of a revolutionary solution to extreme racist terror and oppression seem most serious . One thing bound to be different in Africa is the timetable of economic , political , and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the white overlords feared before World War II ? or than African nationalists dared hope . This rising tempo of demand for reform is already affecting us and our relations with colonial situations on several continents . In the past we have been called upon to pay the bill for mistakes of stubborn French reaction in Indo-China , for example . Are more billions to be wasted in the future in vain attempts to deny self-government and the development of the peoples of French Africa ? A clear , creative role needs to be defined for United States policy in colonial and underdeveloped areas of the world  --  a policy implemented as consistently in the U. N. as outside . Three things have happened in the postwar decade to make the need imperative . Three different but related revolutions have profoundly altered the basis of human existence and outlook in general , and greatly increased the pressure for colonial emancipation in particular . The first is the technological transformation foreshadowed by thermonuclear energy . Along with its dreadful potentials for evil it offers an early shortcut , if properly applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . The second radical innovation in the world system of states is the fact that 1,200,000,000. brown men inhabiting about 7,000,000 square miles of territory have attained full national independence and political equality with the West . Left behind by the " first " industrial revolution , these people are determined to close the gap during " the revolution of rising expectations , " the atomic age . The third revolution is the vast portentous social upheaval dominated by the Communists and stretching from Eastern Asia to Eastern Europe . It now embraces more than one man in every three . The effect of widespread propaganda concerning speedy progress and uplift achieved in Soviet Asia  --  for colored people  --  has raised a competitive challenge in all remaining Western colonies . Still more , the impact of Communist-led 7 ; 01T11. recovery of power and prestige has electrified Africans of all classes with hope . Inevitably it has given at least some rebel nationalists the conviction that the Communist road is the only road whereby countries left far behind can catch up . One such , for example , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be Britain 's first black dominion . Though no Communist , the remarkable Dr. Nkrumah has openly advocated a Union of West African Soviet Socialist States ! PERHAPS because American policy has not been adjusted to the three great changes mentioned we failed to understand , for example , the serious message of the Bandung Conference in Indonesia last April . In adopting a somewhat sneering attitude the United States unnecessarily  --  and quite falsely in terms of our own best tradition  --  ranged itself against legitimate aspirations toward political and social equality that are universal among Asians and Africans . The great majority of the newly independent countries of Asia are non-Communist . Yet being non-Communist obviously does not mean being pro-colonial . When leaders of all Oriental countries  --  only Korea , Soviet Asia , and Formosa were left out  --  joined with seven African states at Bandung to demand self-determination and freedom for all colonies they were not only repeating their own oft-proclaimed faith but also echoing the sentiments of great American patriots . Ins actual fact the remnants of old-style Western imperialism in East Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lingering grip on the Malay peninsula and the coast of Borneo ; Dutch and Australian occupation of New Guinea , disputed by Indonesia ; and odd hangovers of the Portuguese empire thus far overlooked in the rush . The West can not possibly return to impose its will on the continent through such knotholes , even if they continue to be held . In any major war they would be iliabilities , not assets . It is inconceivable that we shall indefinitely antagonize a billion non-Communist Asians rather than encourage the Europeans to find their way out of these few isolated positions with good grace . ASIDE FROM scattered colonial holdings in Oceania , the West Indies , and Central America , the real remaining colonial problems of the world today center in Africa  --  and they are indeed problems of magnitude . Africa covers a fifth of the habitable land area of the earth and 90 per cent of its 200,000,000 blacks are almost entirely dominated by 3,000,000 white men . Asians have three good reasons for resenting the arrangement  --  and for lining up behind African nationalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now done in the U. N. , and increasingly will do in the future . First is their own long history of colonial oppression . Second is their determination to retaliate against all forms of color discrimination . Third , half a million Asians resident in Africa are themselves treated by the whited as inferiors and fare economically little better than the blacks . With the exception of South Africa , Egypt , Libya , Ethiopia , and little Liberia , all Africa consists Of colonies , mandates , trusteeships , or protectorates held by British , French , Portuguese , Spanish , and Belgian overlords . French Africa alone is larger than Greater China and Japan combined  --  and not one in ten of its 5,000,000 inhabitants is literate . British Africa is larger than the United States ; Portugal 's African colonies ' are thirty times the size of the minuscule " mother " country . The Belgian Congo  --  with its riches in minerals , water resources greater than those of the United . States , and uranium mines that produce 96 per cent of the current world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fabulous profits have been taken out of Africa ever , since the lu &ative; slave trade . Until recently little such wealth stayed , in the country for reinvestment . Like the billions made in colonial trade in Asia it was poured back into Europe  --  and much of it disappeared in the fire of the last two wars . Africa has enriched everybody but the Africans , they say . Over wide areas Negroes have lost all their best grazing lands to the whites. ; in many restricted regions they can not buy land at all . Often the best land has been seized by a few white settlers . In the Congo it is owned by half a dozen giant corporations . In ' Kenya colony , 4,000 Europeans own 16,000 square miles  --  an average of four square miles per white man  --  while a million Kikuyus who surround them hold only 2,000 acres of the land once exclusively theirs . Color discrimination and segregation prevail nearly everywhere  --  modified by a Portuguese policy which permits one Negro in a thousand to vote , and by halfhearted French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In South Africa the apartheid policy has deprived the black man of all political rights ( taking away his former right to vote ) and many human rights . Compelled to live in ghettos , he can not even walk the streets of certain areas of the city  --  or even enter one without ' a pass . He is in effect a prisoner in his own country  --  where he is four-fifths of the population . Ninety per cent of East Africans have hookworm or other intestinal worms ; tuberculosis and venereal disease are spreading scarcely checked , and 35 per cent of all blacks born in South Africa die of disease or starvation in their first year . There are only 3,400 doctors in the whole of Africa , and most of these care for whites . The need is for 60,000 doctors at a very minimum  --  three times as many as are studying in the United States . Needs ? There are 700 different languages . Africans obviously need etymologists , language unifiers  --  somebody to give them a way of writing , as Russians did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , veterinarians , skilled workers in metals and wood , engineers , scientists . They need schools , labor unions , colleges , cooperatives , decent housing , pest control , better diets , sanitation , power plants , roads , railways . They need a larger share in the treasure they have produced for the world  --  not to mention a little liberte , egdlite , fraternzte . " Our civilization can not afford to leave development which will not arouse the fear , suspicion , and opposition of the very people who need it most . " The dilemma has a vast importance in the political struggle between East and West for the allegiance of the uncommitted part of the world , in the vast underdeveloped parts of the Middle and Far East and Africa , too , in which so great a proportion of the population still live on the borders of starvation , " wrote Bickham Sweet-Escort in a recent issue of The Listener . He continues thus : For it is just to people like that that the appeal of communism is greatest . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that , if the standard of living of these people is raised they will gradually become deaf , td the voice ' of communism . But I am quite certain that our efforts alone would not ensure the rapid increase on the scale needed . For that it is essential that these areas should have access to the vast productive capacity of the United States , just as the 600,000,000 of ' China can call on the growing industrial strength of Soviet Russia . But as Western civilization is organized at present the United States can not ultimately play its full part . .. because there is nothing which the United States will accept in exchange for all the plant machinery and manufactured goods . If the West is to raise the standard of living of the underdeveloped areas and so immunize them from communism it is vital that we should find some way in which American production can be made available to Asia and Africa in a really big way . Such is the opportunity facing the leaders of this country today  --  and the terms of competitive coexistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone possesses the abundant surpluses of agricultural products , of manufacturing capacity , above all of capital , industrial experience , and know how . What is more , export it must , and on an ever-increasing scale , if the internal economy is not ultimately to face a crisis . Fate thus offers America  --  or at any rate American business men  --  the chance to make great history in a deeply responsible role : There is one aspect of the task , however , which Mr. Sweet-Escott failed to examine . It is one which big-business administration may easily overlook as an essential first purpOse . That the American responsibility to the people of the colonies  --  and people everywhere  --  for insisting that its economic aid be used to hasten self-governing capacity in the colonies , to free them , and to enlarge opportunities and welfare for the poor everywhere  --  rather than to perpetuate their dependence , enriching only the few . During the past decade , under the pretext of fighting communism , we ' have already spent billions of dollars in support of reactionary regimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " on the whole lengthened the life of colonialism , " as Alan Paton recently admitted to be the case in Africa . And by that very effect we frustrate ourselves , he concludes , because " by lengthening the fife of colonialism America is strengthening the appeal of communism . " The question for the American people , therefore , is whether we can reconcile these two purposes  --  world development for greater world freedom  --  in a new and October 29 , 1955creative policy based on full acceptance of the three great changes listed at the opening of these paragraphs . Does the American system possess the ingenuity , the flexibility , the imagination , the interest , and above all the faith to mobilize adequate ' means of bringing aid . on the gigantic scale needed to solve the foremost problems of underprivileged man  --  before he succumbs ? to the " appeal of communism " ? Some possible answers will be considered in ' a concluding editorial .                   @ @
