The Mikado ( book &; lyrics by Sir William Schwenck Gilbert ; music by Sir Arthur Sullivan ; produced by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company ) ushers in yet another D'Oyly Carte visit to Broadway . In a sense , it is always the same visit , as full of tradition and ritual as though the visiting players were visiting royalty . It even seems to fetch the same audiences of devotees . The extravaganzas that once turned Victorian sanity upside down today seem one of the few things still on their feet . Titipu still flourishes , Barataria still stands . <P> D'Oyly Carte productions are still impeccably starched and smooth . The D'Oyly Carters are roguish , but they are expertly roguish . There were rumbles once over Martyn Green 's unbridled , wall-climbing Ko-Ko ; today , roars of sanctified laughter greet his agile footwork and fanwork . <P> The Mikado-though it seems rather like Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations set to hurdy-gurdy tunes*-still holds up . Almost all of Gilbert 's lyrics are beyond cavil , and the best of them are beyond praise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a string of lively tunes . The first-act finale of The Mikado is not less a triumph of operatic brio for being also intended as a travesty . <P> <P> *Except that Bartlett 's actually fails to include such phrases as The flowers that bloom in the spring , tra la ; A source of innocent merriment ; A wandering minstrel I , and many others virtually as famous .
