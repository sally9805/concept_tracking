txt Letters to The Times HENRY SHEMIN.LOUTS H. PINK , pg . 11 Letters to The Times Workmen 's Compensation Re-examination of Law Is Advocated , Conditions Elsewhere Cited To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your recent series of articles on the Workmen 's Compensation Law of New York by your staff writer George Horne , is somewhat inadequate and contains several inconsistencies . On the one hand the law and administration are attacked as too liberal and then employers and others are quoted as either saying the law is good but the administration is poor or vice versa . New York is cited as having a much higher premium rate than New Jersey , After indicating the workmen 's compensation premium rates are predicated upon experience , the article quotes employers who state that the situation in Nee , Jerse ? is worse and that half of the claims there are dubious . While it is true that New York has a good compensation law , it should be noted that other *jurisdictions are not without liberal laws . In New York the maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is greater in the District of Columbia , Hawaii and Wisconsin , and , when dependents ' allowances are included , in Michigan , Oregon , Washington and Massachusetts . In cases of permanent partial disability the rate is higher in Massachusetts and Oregon . In Wisconsin the rate of compensation is 70 per cent of wages , as contrasted with the New York rate of 66-2/3 per cent . In six. ; teen states the waiting period is shorter than in New York . Enacted as/Replacement Critics of the Workmen 's Compensation Law should bear in mind that this law was enacted to replace employers ' liability laws . It is interesting to speculate , in view of the present huge settlements and verdicts in auto negligence cases , just how much workers have given up under our present law . In this connection it should be noted , that Senators Sutherland and Wagner introduced bills to establish workmen 's compensation for railroad workers . These bills failed of passage primarily because they were not supported by the organized railroad workers . I do not mean to urge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all equities should be considered and the cost of both systems compared . There is an old maxim that hard cases make bad law . The few court decisions cited by Mr. Horne do not detract from the fact that , by and large , the law has been decided fairly . It should be remembered that the real purpose of the Workmen 's Compensation Law is the physical and economic rehabilitation of the injured worker . It is true that excessive litigation has , in many instances , obscured that goal . It is true that competitive business must be alert to its cost of compensation insurance . But in New York there are alleviating remedies available to employers . The New York State Insurance Fund , through discounts to qualified individual employers and by dividends to well-managed groups of employers , has reduced compensation costs substantially . Competent selfinsurers have also reduced their compensation costs . Appointment of Referees Perhaps some of the criticism may be due to the method of appointment of workmen 's compensation referees . About twenty years ago a competitive examination was held for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . Since then referees have been appointed , with rare exceptions , as a result of political service or connection . This , despite the report of Prof. Lindsay Rogers , who investigated the administration of workmen 's compensation in 1928 and reported to the Governor of Nee , York that referees should be appointed through competitive examination . Walter F. Dodd , in " Administration of Workmen 's Compensation , " indicates that the good administrative record of Ontario is due to the tenure of its personnel . While a few good referees were appointed under the present system , it seems to me that the time required to train persons unfamiliar with the law and the constant turnover of such persons as a result of political changes are sufficient to condemn the system . It was good for THE TIMES to publish the articles . Workmen 's compensation for many years has not received the attention it should have received . Other forms of social insurance have pushed it into the background .. What is needed is a complete re-examination of the law and its administration , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to ascertain whether it is adhering to its basic purposes . HENRY SHEMIN .. Brooklyn , Oct. 4 , 1951 . TO THE EDITOR OF THS NEW YORK TIMM THE NEW YORK TIMES recently published discussions about Russian policy , past and present . This discussion was occasioned by a speech of Secretary of State Acheson . The Byelorussian position in this matter is clear . The Byelorussian people in the B. S. S. R. are subject to a continuation of the policy of oppression of the Russian czars , beginning under the Muscovite duchies 500 years ago . The historical background of Russia shows a policy of conquest and the enslavement of independent peoples . The Byelorussian-Lithuanian duchy for several centuries engaged in defene eV ( ' wars against attacks from Russia . In conquered Byelorussia in the nineteenth century there were armed insure rections against Russian occupation . In 1867. the Russian Government had interdicted publications in the Byelorussian language . In 1917 the First National Byelorussian Congress in Minsk restored the independent Byelorussian state , which was proclaimed on March 25 , 1918 . The Bolshevists used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1919 an armed Byelorussian insurrection against Soviet occupation in Vielish took place , and in 1920 an armed insurrection took place in Sluzk . At the first opportunity in 1944 the Second National Byelorussian Congress was assembled in Minsk . The 1,039 delegates announced the desire of the Byelorussian people to resume a free and independent national life . The Congress also declared that the Byelorussian people had nothing in common with the U. S. S. Ft , and turned over the Government Of the Byelorussian state to the Byelorussian Central Council . The Byelorussian home guard was fighting against the invasion of the Soviet armies at this time . In the meantime , Soviet imperialism , more than , ever terroristic , threatens the free world . The war in Korea is but one aspect of Soviet expansion and aggression . Communist activity has been used by the Soviet- Government as a diversive method for weakening its adversaries . Now communism is another expression for Russian imperialism as well . Your editorial dealing with this subject and with the speech of Secretary Acheson caused protests front various Russian emigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian group which was enslaved by a czar 's imperialism and vOich was perpetuated by the U. S. S. R. All Russian political groups , except for internal differences , defend the " mother " unit and the enslavement of nationalities previously conquered by Russia . The only positive solution of the dangerous Euro-Asiatic imprisonment of whole peoples in this day of the acceptance of the principle of self-determination for enslaved ' peoples is the recreation for them of their previous independent states . RADASLAV ASTROVSKI , President , Byelorussian Central Council . San Martin , Argentina , Sept. 24 , 1951 . Angle Parking Suggested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Among the greatest evils of our auto parking situation is that of " double parking . " The law against it is not being enforced and thus , besides increasing the hazards , works a great hardship and injustice to those autoists who are parked at the curb . On one-way streets  --  and all crosstown streets are one way  --  parking at an angle ( of about 60 degrees ) , on one side only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by actual : measurement , of at least as many oars as can park on both sides , when parallel to the curb , and make getting into and out of space much easier , while leaving one side of the street clear . Angle parking is not anything untried . It exists and works well in a few places  --  usually about hospitals . Why can it not be extended to all oneway streets ? M. SCHULMAN . New York , Oct. 4 , 1951 . A. H. S. Payment to Hospitals To THE EDIPOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial asking for support of the United Hospital Fund 's campaign for funds states : " Even the Blue Cross , which defrays the hospital expenses of those insured under its plan , pays the hospitals only $11 a day . " Today the average daily Associated Hospital Service payment to hospitals for Blue Cross members hospitalized in semiprivate accommodations is $18.25 . The over-all average , including wards , is more than $17.25 . As far back as 1947 our average daily payment to hospitals had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formula was worked out in 1948 providing for payments to be revised periodically on a quarterly basis in an upward - or downward direction , depending on living costs . According to the formula a basic rate of payment for each hospital was determined on the basis of its charges and its actual over-all cost in caring for patients at that time . The formula , now in effect , also calls for an increase or decrease in payments to hospitals , depending on the cost of labor , food and other expenses . In view of continued ' inflation , the payments have been constantly increased . We are only too well aware of the financial problems our hospitals face , and we heartily endorse the United Hospital Fund 's campaign . We appreciate and endorse the spirit and purpose of your editorial . ? Despite the sub ? stantial payments made by Blue Cross , there is urgent need for public support/ LOUIS H.
