As young go-getters in Rochelle , Ill. ( pop . 5,400 ) , Frank and James Spellman were doing nicely buying , selling and trucking grain . Then they expanded , and bought a grain elevator . In 1949 , they got a contract with the Agriculture Department 's Commodity Credit Corp . to store 200,000 bu. of grain . The Spellmans , both in their early 303 , began expanding faster . They added to their fleet of trucks , worked into real-estate deals , began shipping grain to Chicago by rail . <P> But their bubble burst . Last week they were indicted on 28 counts by an Illinois federal grand jury for fraudulently selling $282,000 worth of CCC 's grain that they had been paid to store . It was the latest indictment in a series of grain scandals ( TIME , Jan. 28 ) that may end up costing the Agriculture Department $5,000,000 to $7,000,000 . <P> The Spellmans ' warehouse , the Government charged , was not big enough to store 100,000 bushels of grain in the first place . After the Spellmans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Government inspectors who might come along . At the top of the elevator , just below the catwalk , they hung small 275-bu. bins so that anyone looking in would think that the elevator was full . At the bottom , they kept just enough grain to cover the elevator door space , in case anyone peeked in . But they need not have been so careful . In the two years they stored Government grain , no one bothered to check up on them . Not a single inspector called at their warehouse . <P> The shortages were discovered only because the Spellmans expanded so fast that they did n't have enough cash to pay their bills . When a Chicago grain broker tried to collect by attaching their property , the <P> Spellmans knew they were in trouble , owned up to the shortages and filed in bankruptcy . Now out on bail , Frank Spellman has a job as a truck mechanic ; James is working for a construction company . CCC figures the- Spellmans owe it $316,959 , including the fees paid them for storage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
