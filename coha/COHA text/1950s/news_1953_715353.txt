txt All-Star Show Greets G. L 's on First Ship In From Korea By MURRAY SCHUMACH An 18,000-ton troopship was converted last night into the most talented night club in America to help Korea war veterans pass the time as they waited anxiously to establish their first American beachhead in eighteen months . For hours the highest-priced bands , singers , dancers and actors in New York " entertained more than 2,000 ' troops in the lounge of the Navy transport Gen. William Weigel as she lay dead in the waters of New York Harbor . Until sunrise this morning , Navy ' tugs were to take stars from the city 's sell-out // to make the veterans forget impatience to get ashore . Shortly before 1 o'clock this morning , when stars of Broadway shows began arriving , the gala affair , arranged by a Broadway columnist , built up to its climax . Among those who boarded the transport in the early morning hours were Cab Calloway , Gracie Fields , Vanessa Brown , Helen Gallagher , Martha Wright and Thomas Mitchell . Many Seek Autographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment the whistles of the G. L 's were augmented by requests for autographs . But despite the music , songs and jokes , many soldiers still seemed resentful over the fact that the trip home had taken twenty-five days cr ? nearly twice as long as it would have required had they landed on the West Coast . This was the first time veterans of fighting in Korea had been brought directly to the East Coast from the embattled peninsula . Not even the New Yorkers , who were told they would be able to see relatives at Pier 1 , Brooklyn , this morning , and would be greeted afterward by Mayor Impellitteri , were entirely happy as they looked out across the harbor waters at the lights of Manhattan 's towers . Many of the 351 soldiers from the metropolitan area were worried about getting home in time to go to church with their families on Easter Sunday . Nevertheless , as the show got under way the soldiers became resigned to another night of waiting and , 750 at a time , they crowded into the lounge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most famous shows . Acts Are Greeted Warmly Companionways were bedecked with colored streamers ; private organizations distributed cartons of cigarettes and boxes of candy . In the low-ceilinged lounge , campaignribboned soldiers , crowded on folding chairs , squatted on the deck , lined the bulkheads . With tremendous enthusiasm they applauded , cheered and whistled for almost every act . On the deck above , where other soldiers waited their turn to see the main show , small bands blared and thumped while G. L 's jitterbugged . In the audience were the hour glass patch of the Seventh Division , the horse head of the First Cavalry , the lightning flash emblem of the Twenty-Fifth and the Taro leaf of the Twenty-Fourth . Three holders of Silver Stars were among the wearers of the green Korean patch . They were T/Sgt . John B. Donohoe of Atlantic City ; Pfc . Dennis T. Jackson of Fort Myers , Fla. , and Pfc . Ronald Spilis of Toledo , Ohio . Only once since the ship left Sasebo , Japan , with its 2,238 troops , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans gone ashore . This " liberty " of four hours had occurred in Panama . The only other stops were in Colombia and Puerto Rico , where soldiers from these countries disembarked . Other than these breaks in the monotony there had been only endless military monotony of the troopship ; meals at the same hours every day ; the counting of days and then hours until they would land ; the endless bellowing of the loudspeaker . Nevertheless , despite the long trip , the soldiers seemed in good humor when the ship came alongside Quarantine at 5:35 P. M. They whistled , waved and yelled as ship whistles greeted their " dressed up " vessel . At 6:01 the General Weigel 's anchor slid noisily into the harbor and a loud cheer went up from the solid masses of khaki lining the decks . As a black ball rose along the halyards and the ship 's whistle blew , a voice , obviously groomed in the bleachers of Ebbets Field , called from the ship : " AU ashore that 's going ashore . " There was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transport arid the soldiers dividing their attention between passing ships and the dark glow of Manhattan 's skyscrapers , misty in the gray twilight . Women Cheered , Officers Derided One sailor who joshed a few soldiers about getting seasick in the calm harbor while they waited to go ashore was told sharply : " We got more seatime than you got , sailor . " By 8 o'clock , an hour before the entertainment was scheduled to start , the soldiers had formed two columns along a companionway below decks and roared approval of any woman who passed or derision of any officers . Finally , when an admiral started to move through the gantlet , there was a sudden hush and one G. I. yelled : " Three cheers for the Weigel , " thereby affording a good excuse for the practice of yelling at any officer . As soon as the admiral had passed , another G. I. shouted : " And they can keep the Weigel . " In other parts of the ship , soldiers loitered in the shadows , watching the lighted Statue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights . Conversation alternated between amazement at first sight of New York 's skyline to bitter reminiscences about the crossing , particularly the unpleasant memory of a brawl in Balboa during the soldier 's only time ashore . Arrival Was Set for Morning Few of the soldiers believe the officials ' explanations for the night 's delay in port . The explanation by the Navy 's Military Sea Transportation Service was that the Army had passed word to the New York Port of Embarkation about two weeks ago that disembarkation would take place this morning at 10 o'clock and that transportation to other parts of the country had been worked out on this basis . The reason the Weigel put in on the East Coast instead of as in previous cases , at San Francisco or Seattle , was because a New York ship repair company had won a 82,500,000 contract to repair the ship . It was decided , therefore , that since the ship would be coming east , the troops , who for the most part were from east of the Mississippi , should be brought to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
