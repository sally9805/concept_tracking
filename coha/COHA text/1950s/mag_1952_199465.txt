In 1851 , when the American paddle-wheeler Pacific set a record for the Atlantic crossing , steamboats could barely exceed the time of a fast sailing vessel . The Pacific 's time : 9 days 19 hr. 25 min . She was the last U.S. speed queen-since her day , the British , the Germans , the French and the Italians have held the Atlantic records . Last week , a century after the Pacific 's run , the new superliner United States raced east into the Atlantic from New York . <P> It seemed almost a foregone conclusion that she would exceed the mark of 3 days 20 hr. 42 min. set in 1938 by the Cunard liner Queen Mary on the run between Ambrose Lightship and Bishop Rock on the southwest coast of England . But merely nibbling an hour or so off the record would mean little . Ships like the Lusitania and the old Mauretania had guaranteed a 4day crossing in the early 1900s . The Normandie and the two British Queens had cut it to four days in the 1930s . If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to build her , the United States had to come significantly closer to airline time . <P> She quickly showed that she was capable of making history . In her first 20 hr. 24 min. at sea ( a steamship 's running time is figured from noon to noon ) , she averaged 34.11 knots-as compared with the Queen Mary 's average of 31.13-and covered 696 nautical miles . The next day , despite heavy fog which forced her navigators to rely on radar , she increased her speed to 35.6 knots , and covered 801 miles , the greatest distance ever traversed by a ship in 24 hours . On her third day out , she went even faster , averaged an astounding 36.17 knots-almost 41 statute miles an hour . <P> Shortly after 5 the next morning , her deep-voiced siren burst into a jubilant roar ; she was off Bishop Rock , 2,982 miles from Ambrose Lightship , after a crossing of only 3 days 10 hr. 40 min . She had averaged 35.59 knots , had knocked 10 hr. 2 min. off the old mark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a sportsmanlike message : " Godspeed . Welcome to the Atlantic . Am sacking my chief engineer . " Said the new ship 's beaming skipper , Commodore Harry Manning : " I 've still got more speed up my sleeve- we were just cruising . " <P> The 3day crossing was actuality , and a new era of steamship travel had begun .
