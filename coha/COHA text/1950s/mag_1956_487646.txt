THERE WERE things going on in the United States this Christmas season that just could not be reconciled . On the one hand , at the National Automobile Show in New York -- the first since 1940 ? grown men and women stared with the drunken eyes of children at the great tin gauds with " swept wings " ( they fly ? ) , " starflight styling " ( oh , interplanetary ) , " tail fins " ( no , they swim ) and " anti-dive devices " ( ah , submarines ! ) . On the other hand , elsewhere were symptoms of the seeing realism which glonously comes to the top of the American character a little way short of disaster . Those who despair of the American destiny need to be reminded of Abraham Lincoln 's data on fooling all the people some of the time , etc . Let us look at the fatuous part first  --  the $10,000,000 Automobile Show . It 's a fine show . A very noisy floor show goes on six times a day , loaded with several dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant as those scattered around or inside the exhibits . These latter dolls are much too good for the common people unless of course one buys the car on display . The men customers kept speaking to them hopefully and the smiles froze on the exquisite Gothic faces . The cars are beautiful too . As objects to install in the parlor or back yard , there can be no cavil about their long , low , sneaky charm . I could understand a man who DAVID CORT claims that , in regard to automobiles , his status is strictly that of the Man from Mars ? or Missouri . wanted to be buried in one . But as something to take down the street to get a coke , they are nearly as implausible as a four-horse Carthaginian chariot . Consider that American cars are already eating up gasoline at an annual rate of a billion and a quarter forty-two-gallon-barrels , requiring something like three billion barrels of petroleum . And all new cars require high-octane gas . Proved United States oil reserves are currently only ten times the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so the new cars boost power as high as 375 h.p. with greatly increased appetites for high-octane gas . Many go 140 miles an hour , but Buick supplies a buzzer to warn you when you exceed sixty . If you ca n't use that extra eighty miles an hour , what good is it ? One answer is that your motor is always idling , even at sixty , and wasting more gas . Another answer is fast acceleration to get out of , and into , trouble on the road . AS FOR the increased car lengths , city parking is already a nightmare and the nation 's road system already congested , even though the road surface is 40,000 square miles , equivalent to five New England states . The new cars will clog the streets with luxurious , empty luggage compartments . Every American man is a car expert , like the small boys of 1914 who first began mounting those lovely words , " horsepower , " " carburetor , " " ignition " etc. , around the first garages . Yet even horsepower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advertised 375 h.p. , the textbook 's indicated horsepower would be something over 400 h.p . The 375 represents " brake horse power " at maximum r.p.m. or speed , say , of 140 miles an hour . This is cut about 25 percent by the time it gets past the differential to the rear wheels  --  or 300 h p . The great torque of an American car is what produces the " thrust " that makes it dangerous . A racing driver would know enough to take the options ( axle ratio , special springs , etc. ) that gave him something he could handle . He would be afraid of the showroom car . THE tolerant British are very kind to the new American cars . The Economist writes , " The pattern of American design strategy depends , of course , on the general acceptance of one particular shape and size of automobile by the great majority of its customers  --  a roomy six-seater with a large trunk . .. automatic transmission ; independent suspension in front and a beam axle behind ; a structure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the body and comparatively little contributed by the body itself . " Automatic transmissions " mass-produced in very high volume can nowadays be had for no great increase in price , and the 250 pounds they may add in weight are easily lost in the massive , powerful automobiles of Detroit . . . . In the United States , where freedom from noise and vibration is at a premium , and where most roads are so good that road-holding is at a discount . . . independent rear-springing has made no impact at all . " Detroit 's conservatism has a reason ; the industry has never forgotten Chrysler 's almost fatal mistake in the thirties of offering the advanced Airflow to public apathy . But the result is a car conceived as a featherbed on which the owner floats through life buoyed by feelings of enormous relaxed power . There would be no harm in selling these feelings to somebody in a seat at the movies , but selling them to him when he is in a two-ton vehicle moving at sixty m.p.h. is not nice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and his vehicle , as if he were riding a horse . The American automobile 's problem is to convince him that he is floating along one foot above the road . The two problems are in fatal conflict . The second sells the car ; the first may kill the driver or somebody else . If the driver knowingly takes the chance , all right ; but if he is surprised when it happens to him , as he usually is , his end is truly tragic . THE NEW cars make the driver feel as if he were at home in his favorite armchair , with the heat on , the radio playing and the landscape as unobtrusive as a TV screen . This is all an escape from a volatile reality ? a vehicle rolling along a curving road at sixty m p.h . Thus , cold sober , in broad daylight , on a little-traveled thruway , he has the illusion of " flowing " around another car when his car is actually at seventy m , . p.h. , describing a self-made curve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over or going out of control . People do not necessarily buy a foreign car for the gasoline savings , the low upkeep or the durable little engine . The foreign car also holds ? the road and handles like a well-broken horse . It has used the know-how of modern engineering  --  no mystery to Detroit  --  to produce the most efficient light engine possible , the most effective suspension and the best road-holding qualities . On curving roads or city streets , I am told , a 375-h.p. showroom Chrysler could not catch an old , sixty h.p . Rolls-Royce . Within five minutes the Chrysler would be on its back , wheels spinning . Yet the Rolls Royce would be three feet shorter and two feet higher than the Chrysler , and have only one sixth the horse-power . As against such a performance , the American car 's more famous faults are secondary . So it has too much power ; so it uses too much gas ; so the new engines are so arranged that you can hardly get at your own spark-plugs ; so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50 replacement ( it ca n't be hammered out ) ; so its length needs twice the road-room to make a turn ; so its chrome stripes merely fake new design ; so it has ten motors that can get out of order ( transmission , brakes , windows , seats , steering , etc. ) ; so nothing can be repaired by the owner . Most of this has been described as " built-in obsolescence . " All , all , are forgivable ; but it is not forgivable that this gorgeous juke-box , with all its lights flashing , may be taking the driver to his death . At the moment when he feels safest and most powerful , he may die . A million and a quarter have already been killed at the moment of power ( some of them pedestrians ) ; an undetermined percentage of another fifty million have died later of their injuries . DETROIT expects to sell at least 6 3 million cars in 1957 against 1955 's top 7.2 . It had spent over a billion dollars over the past three years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new colors . These remind one of the colors in military service ribbons and are often properly metallic-looking . " Cutlass bronze , rose mist , artesian blue , desert glow , ice green " 535 are some Oldsmobile samples . The Lincoln offers an ominous " Presidential black . " THE DAZED look did not blanket America . American realism was also on the job . Preparatory to the Automobile Show , Dave Garroway and an audience of industrial designers were actually encouraged to badger the chief designers of these beautiful monstrosities . GM offered a ruddy , poker-playing Good Time Charlie , Ford a very talkative tennis-player , Chrysler a grey-faced , competent non-Ivy Leaguer , American a hoarse , straight-talking farmer , and Studebaker a balding Reserve Intelligence Major . I was informed privately that most Detroit designers would as soon be seen in a zoot suit as in the cars they design . But it was soon evident that the new cars were a joke . All the designers seemed to resent the fact that Garroway had put a 1952 Jaguar XK-120 engine into his old 1934 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1934 racing Studebaker . At this gathering a tone of ridicule of the new cars seemed correct . Garroway asked , " I 'm building a place in the country ? how long should I make my garage ? What 's the future of the fin ? What do you plan for the low car  --  how low can you get ? " The audience 's questions were in the same disenchanted vein . Raymond Loewy , asked to make a comment , rose gravely and pronounced " I wish you all a very Merry Christmas . " The answers of the five designers charged with the idiocy of their designs , function-wise , boiled down to one answer . " The American public is to blame . If they want it , who are we not to let them have it ? " The public , it seems , is not captive but captor ; the automobile industry is not the creator , but the helpless creature , of its market . The stylists or designers had utterly accepted the sales department 's thesis that every American car-owner wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a king for three months and will pay a high price for the feeling . He brings to a car-purchase something of the emotion he brought downstairs on Christmas morning when he was six years old . The new car looks like a Christmas tree , not so much in his eyes ( he will be inside it most of the time ) as in the eyes ( as he imagines ) of his wife , children and neighbors . The long slinky look , the unrepairable dozen motors , the chrome and the extras are childhood 's miracles under the tree . Noel ! Noel ! I do not believe in this cynical appraisal of the American citizen , which marches with the opinion of the slick magazine editor . Certainly American advertising and Communist propaganda are persuasive , but I do not believe that all the people are as foolish as Detroit and Moscow think . An annual turnover of seven million unpaid-for cars , swelling the citizen 's present thirty billion dollar debt , is not really the foundation of American democracy . The policeman at the Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life , remembered that in the old days every car had held four or five people , but now the average car brought one or two . The larger , more powerful new cars transport only one third the number of people as did the old cars . The car-owners are growing less , ' not more , sociable ; the traffic and the road system are alienating the people from their society . A man 's pride in his car seems to be an anti-social emotion . On a mass-production level , it seems somehow related to the Egyptian Pharaoh 's reasons for building a pyramid tomb . At 42nd Street and Madison Avenue , a hundred citizens are crossing the street , at the intersection , with the lights . One more unimportant citizen is added , going down the street for a beer , and the hundred fall back and let the 101st through , in sudden fear for their lives Ridiculous ? No , for the last man has a two-ton casing and even without glancing at you can kill you stone-dead . The hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , I can not resist quoting a little from Consumer Report , January , 1955 , on how to buy a used car . It seems that the cost of owning and operating a ' car is $1,316 the first year , $1,182 the second , $942 the third , $922 the fourth . The ideal buy is a three-year-old car that has been driven only 20,000 miles ( but do n't , believe the speedometer ) . Some of the recommended tests deserve to be described : 1 ) If the used car shows collision damage , abuse or high mileage , go away . Worn floor mat or brake pedal may indicate high mileage . Try to poke pencil through paint over small bumps or pits . 2 ) Jump on each corner of bumpers . Shock absorbers are defective if car shakes both up and down to normal . 3 ) When you shake top of front tire , clanking shows worn suspension or loose wheel bearings . 4 ) Suspension is out of line if front wheels , sighted from thirty feet away , are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if front wheels do not move before you have turned steering wheel two inches . 6 ) Clutch pedal needs work if resistance to your foot does not sharply increase after one inch . 7 ) The hydraulic brakes have a leak if foot brake sinks slowly after fifteen seconds of pressure . 8 ) If starter clanks , teeth may be missing in ring gear . 9 ) Big puff of blue smoke from exhaust after racing , idling , racing engine indicates very expensive job needed on valves or rings . 10 ) Trade your car before August , and get a car bonded by National Bonded Cars , Inc. , at a cost of $35 . And so on . Such sharp advice is particularly refreshing after one has been bemused by the dream-boats at the Automobile Show . It is very Yankee , and the Automobile Show is certainly very un-Yankee.
