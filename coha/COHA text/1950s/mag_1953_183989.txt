After a traffic accident , a doctor can often do more good than a policeman . Last week , at its annual clinical sessions , the A.M.A. took up a relatively new idea : that by warning patients , doctors may be as important in preventing traffic accidents and in reducing the severity of injuries in the accidents as they are later in patching up battered victims . Of the 90 scientific exhibits in St. Louis ' Kiel Auditorium , none attracted more attention from the 2,500 visiting physicians than a group of six booths dealing with highway safety . <P> Three doctors from the University of Virginia 's School of Medicine charted the physician 's responsibility in the prevention of accidents . It begins , they said , with the detection of disorders of the nervous system which may predispose a patient to highway accidents . Chief among these : an uncontrollable tendency to fall asleep ( narcolepsy ) , both petit-mal and grand-mal epilepsy , brain hemorrhages , mental deficiencies and illnesses , Parkinsonism , the aftereffects of lobotomy , and paralysis of nerve centers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of the heart and arteries about which patients need special advice : severe high blood pressure , hypersensitivity of the main artery in the neck , the aftereffects of a heart attack , narrowing of the aorta , or angina pectoris so severe that it may cause crippling pain . Some abnormalities of the senses may easily go undetected , especially in the slipshod license examinations given in most states . Notable among these are tunnel vision-the ability to see straight ahead , but not far enough to the right or left-and disorders of the labyrinth of the ear , which controls balance . Also , there is the matter of age : " All drivers over 65 should have annual re-evaluations , " said the Virginia doctors . <P> But the trouble may be less in the patient than in the prescription for what ails him . Many of the most widely used drugs can set off reactions about which the patient should be warned before he drives : alcohol , sedatives , narcotics , antihistaminics , anticonvulsants and some of the antibiotics . <P> " The Influence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Herman A. Heise showed the latest gadgets developed for the A.M.A. and the National Safety Council to provide legal proof of drunken driving . Chief problem , even with the popular " Drunkometer , " is that there is no clear line between sobriety and " under the influence . " With less than one-twentieth of 1% alcohol in the blood , nearly everybody can drive safely ; with more than three-twentieths , virtually nobody can . But within that range , different individuals have their faculties impaired to very different degrees . The solution : results of these gadget tests must be used to confirm other evidence . <P> Indiana state police officers recommended that motorists wear safety belts and crash helmets . But Dr. Jacob Kulowski of St. Joseph , Mo . took a more radical line . Much of the trouble , he insisted , is in the design of automobiles , and he showed horror pictures to prove it , with front-seat passengers most often the victims . Automakers , he said , should pad the dashboard and get rid of the face-smashing projections which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
