In an assembly room of Washington 's Mayflower Hotel one morning last week gathered a group of 600 . The President of the United States was there . So were the Vice President , the Chief Justice of the United States , Cabinet members , Congressmen , diplomats , businessmen . They ate a sturdy breakfast ( grapefruit , scrambled eggs , sausage , ham , hominy grits and gravy ) . Then the chairman of the meeting , Republican Senator Frank Carlson of Kansas , called order , and the annual prayer breakfast of the International Council for Christian Leadership got down to its purpose . <P> " This morning , " said Baptist Carlson , " we are here to renew our faith and our commitment to God . " In the next half-hour , half a dozen notables rose to their feet . Wisconsin Senator Alexander Wiley , a Lutheran , read from the First Psalm ( " Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly . . . " ) . Vice President Nixon , a Quaker , read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my commandment , That ye love one another , as I have loved you . . . " ) . Hotelman Conrad Hilton , their host , a Roman Catholic , told them : " It took a war and the frightening evil of Communism to show the world that this whole business of prayer is not a sissy , a counterfeit thing . . . Rather it is a part of man 's personality , without which he limps . " <P> The last speaker was Chief Justice Earl Warren , who was raised a Methodist , now frequently attends Baptist services with his wife . " I believe no one can read the history of our country , " he said , " without realizing that the Good Book and the spirit of the Saviour have from the beginning been our guiding geniuses . . . Whether we look to the first Charter of Virginia . . . or to the Charter of New England . . . or to the Charter of Massachusetts Bay . . . or to the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut . . . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian principles . . . <P> " I believe the entire Bill of Rights came into being because of the knowledge our forefathers had of the Bible and their belief in it : freedom of belief , of expression , of assembly , of petition , the dignity of the individual , the sanctity of the home , equal justice under law , and the reservation of powers to the people . . . " I like to believe we are living today in the spirit of the Christian religion . I like also to believe that as long as we do so , no great harm can come to our country . "
