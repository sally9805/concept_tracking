txt Mayor Wagner traveled to Canada yesterday to make a speech , presumably by invitation , Ion problems of the big city . As the saying goes , a prophet sometimes enjoys more honor abroad than at home . There is nothing wrong with the Mayor of New York going to other cities to help them with advice , or to learn how other cities manage their affairs . But we might wish that Mayor Wagner 's record of the last few months was somewhat brighter with accomplishment , so that he could shine more convincingly as an exemplar of city leadership . The fact is that the Mayor 's administration seems to be suffering froth mid-term lethargy . His prestige has fallen . Government is largely on  --  a day-to-day basis , with long-term goals obscured . The effort is to hold the line , to plug up holes in the dikes as they appear . Affirmative action is lacking . The tendency , even when a problem presses , is to let it stew a while in hopes it will dissolve . If it remains stubbornly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and nothing wrong with this ? is to assign it to the Deputy Mayor or to the City Administrator , but even then , when the report is in or a program proposed , the delay while waiting for definitive decision from the Mayor may be a long one . We do not wish to be unfair . The record is not entirely barren . The old Bureau of Real Estate has been reformed . The subway power plants have been sold to private management . The Code of Ethics for city employes has been adopted . The Mayor was finally prodded by insistent events into enlarging the police force , which stood yesterday at an actual strength of 23,653 , still short 855 policemen of authorized quota , with 200 more members to be appointed later this week . But the feeling of decisive drive toward recognizable objectives is missing . What has become of City Charter reform ? What ever happened to one-way avenues in midtown Manhattan ? ? When will the Mayor begin something better than a half-hearted campaign to assure passage of the critically important $500,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular referendum is less than a month away ? . Will the Mayor ever sit down with the Port of New York Authority , as he promised long ago , to discuss beneficial transfer of waterfront modernization ? What steps has City Hall taken to accept its share of the responsibility for educational reforms recommended in the Preusse and Heald reports , some of which lie outside the province of the Superintendent of Schools ? When is the Mayor going to make good on the 1953 campaign promise to " pay to voluntary hospitals the actual cost of patient care in municipal hospitals , " a principle still unhonored by about $8 per day per patient ? These are a few , but only a few , of the problems of New York City on which the people are waiting for more energetic leadership than they are getting at - the moment from Mayor Wagner . The public wants to see the Mayor make some of the " many hard and bitter decisions " that he promised to make , in the first annual message of his second term . We recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being Mayor . But Mr. Wagner asked for it . His political reputation is running downhill , he is disappointing his supporters , and he can recover only by taking charge , by assuming leadership .
