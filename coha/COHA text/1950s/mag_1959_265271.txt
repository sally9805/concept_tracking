SIGHT AND INSIGHT ( 191 pp. ) - Alexander Eliot-McDowell , Obolensky ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Art is communion . This idea binds together a sheaf of reflections on the nature , meanings , and ends of painting by TIME 's Art Editor Alexander Eliot ( Three Hundred Years of American Painting ) . Highly personal , aphoristic , poetic , Sight and Insight shuns critical pedantries in art to speak of bigger things-life and death , God and man , the wisdom of children , the power of dreams , love , fate , and the human soul . <P> In approaching a masterpiece , show simple courtesy , suggests Author Eliot : let the painting speak first . This demands " a kind of reverence , a still gratitude , but definitely not admiration . The moment one stops to say . ' Is n't that lovely ! ' one is in danger of losing the way . " Beauty 's shadow is significance : " Every great painting shows something seen plus something seen into . . . sight and insight . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting , the " latent content " is the other half , the question the artist answered without consciously asking it . <P> The Sun Philosophers . No technique-detective or brushstroke spy , Author Eliot is instead one of the sun philosophers who value the lights that men and artists live by . Light is the sensuous hero of Sight and Insight : " Velsquez ' light is like transparent golden bees swarming the honeyed shadow , while Rogier van der Weyden 's is like water over marble . . . even when stealing into Vermeer 's darkest interior by a narrow window , light is welcomed as a lover . The far corners whisper hello to light . Instead of humping their backs like angry cats the shadows under the furniture are purring . A lady smooths a tablecloth : light smooths it for her and gently holds her hand upon it , saying , ' This usual busy morning is forever . ' " <P> One form of light makes Author Eliot bridle , the " cruel " light of " scientific restoration " : " Major paintings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical swabs ... If there be fifty nailheads in a painted cask , they want to see all fifty . So they strip away . . . Hardly a single master has escaped intact , but Rembrandt appears to have suffered most of all , both in America and in Europe . His celebrated Night Watch at Amsterdam is now a Day Watch " Some other Eliot reflections : <P> " Merely symbolic art-art requiring a key-is always a door to a closet , whereas great art is an open door to great experience . " <P> " The critic who makes judging a matter of principle-who keeps criticizing instead of trying to understand-is rather like a man with a cane , alone in a garden , decapitating weeds and flowers alike . Anything that has size or mystery about it stands in danger of him . " <P> " By holding the stars upon his head , Heracles gained the apples of immortality . And it is true that a sense of eternity-if not immortality-will often spring from contemplating ageless powers : stars , mountains , oceans , man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
