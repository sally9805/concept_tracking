This is the Life I Love By ALICIA PATTERSON as l0 Id to I lal Burion U ntil slightly more than eighteen years ago , my specialty was making a business out of pleasure . On such recondite matters as riding to hounds , fly-fishing for trout , shooting big game , or piloting a private plane , I could speak with the voice of authority . These pointless preoccupations channeled off a flair for innocent hell raising , which when I was young caused my family lots of worry . In what little time was left over , I made sporadic efforts to become a good newspaperwoman . My love for the newspaper business was inherited , for my father , the late Joseph Medi11 Patterson , was the founder and publisher of the New York Daily News . Father was a wonderful guy  --  a warm , gay and tough person born to understand why people behave as they do : Why they laugh and cry and hate and love ; and why they buy some newspapers but ignore others . The Daily News , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 2,000,000 circulation , which makes it the largest daily newspaper in the United States . To live up to father was my ambition , and to be his companion a priceless education . I traveled with him wherever in the world news was breaking . It was a fine experience , and always fun , but it shut me off from the day-to-day grind of big and little news assignments that transform a cub reporter into a pro . Of course I could n't help dreaming that I might become a publisher on my own someday . I am the fifth generation of a newspaper-publishing family . In 1819 my great-greatgrandfather , Judge James Patrick , established the weekly Tuscarawas Chronicle in eastern Ohio . His daughter Catherine married Joseph Medi11 , who made the Chicago Tribune " the world 's greatest newspaper , " as its masthead has long proclaimed . Medill 's daughter Elinor married my grandfather , Robert Wilson Patterson , the Tribune 's editor . Unfortunately for my ambitions , father deep down doubted that any woman could stand up singlehanded to the turbulent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only exception in his book was my enchanting and hot-tempered aunt , his sister , Eleanor ( Cissy ) Patterson , who died in 1948 . Washington has n't yet recovered from the ten-year tornado she stirred up as editor and publisher of the lively and opinionated Washington Times-Herald . Continued from Page 17 ) After her death , the paper was absorbed by the Washington Post in 1954 . Despite his personal feelings , father told me I would become a member of a triumvirate that would operate and control the Daily News after his death , the two others being executives of the newspaper . It was a wonderful plan , but it never came true , in part because father and I fell out over Franklin D. Roosevelt . Once the President 's good friend and most powerful inewspaper supporter , father came to feel that Roosevelt had dragged us into World War II , . i Id as a confirmed isolationist hated him for it . linked Roosevelt and stood up for him . fhe formerly warm relationship between father and me began to chill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he changed his will . News as a result operates under a man-form of trusteeship in which no Patterson has a deciding voice , though I still Xt on the board of directors as a minority The man who emancipated me from pur- elessness was consequently not father , but my husband , Harry F. Guggenheim , whom I married in 1939 . Harry is a man with a dis-tinguished military record in two wars , and an equally distinguished record as a diplomat , businessman , aviator and philanthropist . The Guggenheims established a world-wide mining and metallurgical empire , and have since given much of their fortunes away through a series of imaginative foundations . The founder of the family came here from Switzerland , more than .100 years ago . They have always combined a : deep human sense with a hardheaded approach to financial matters , and a'firm convielion that time can not be wasted gracefully . .

" People Who make a business out of pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pub- ItshIng a newspaper , and late in 1939 Harry and I began to search for one . Harry was acting from dual motives . He did n't want me running amok from sheer boredom , and he wanted to prepare me for my future role on the News , which I still expected to fill . On September 3 , 19141 , I walked into a converted garage in Hempstead , Long Island . It was a run-down sort of building , but to me it seemed the most beautiful one in the world . pressed a large black button . With a slow , gathering rumble , the first issues of my own daily paper flipped off two secondhand newspaper presses . Atop the tabloid front page , in bold type , was the name , NEWSDAY . We had selected it from thousands of entries in a prize contest " to name the new paper . " I was editor and publisher . Harry , as copublishcr , set up the labor contracts , established the advertising and circulation rates , set up the business office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in me by providing nearly a million dollars to keep Newsday running until , in 1946 , we finally began making a profit . The two of us have worked together  --  not always agreeing  --  combining the editorial knowledge of the Pattersons with the business knowledge of the Guggenheims . Even with this auspicious start , many of my acquaintances regarded Newsday as a rich woman 's toy . " How nice of your husband to give you such a pleasant wedding present , " one said to me . Even father referred to it as " Alicia 's little paper out on Long Island . " The surveys we had commissioned forecast a maximum circulation of 15,000 for Newsday , but only if we were both smart and lucky . We were up against the competition of the New York City dailies , published just fifteen miles to the west of us . We had to sell ourselves to the suburban commuters of Nassau and Suffolk counties , a highly sophisticated crew . Once or twice , before the paper got under way , succumbed to black doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Had I known what was coming along after the war , I would n't have worried . What came along was a stampede to the New York suburbs . By crusading for a change in the building code to eliminate the requirement for cellars , Newsday made possible the opening of a huge , low-cost cellarless housing development named Levittown . Nassau and Suffolk shot up from a combined population of 604,000 in 1940 to a combined population of 1,450,000 in 1958 , and Newsday was a smart-enough product to ride the same ascending curve . Last October , at our new plant in Garden City , I raised on the office flagpole a white-lettered banner that said , CIRCULATION 300,000 . When you combine our rate of circulation growth and the volume of advertising we print , far greater than any New York City paper , it can be truthfully said that no other newspaper has ever gone so far so fast . We are now the largest daily in New York State outside the city ? which we at Newsday consider a dying community anyway  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this good fortune , I have both Harry and father to thank , Pa may have realized it only dimly , but he was testing me , toughening me , and educating me for the job I now hold . This training , I might add , has been invaluable in other activities of a busy life , including , now , ( Continued on Page 44 ) The Bell System is an outstanding example of American democracy in business . Millions of people use telephone service . 735.000 people work for the Bell companies . More than 1,600,000 people own AT &T; stock . The owners of American Telephone and Telegraph Company stock are people in all walks of life . Most of them arc small share owners . No one individual owns as much as 1/30th of one per cent of the stock . Many thousands own five and ten shares . About half own fifteen shares or less . Women are the largest group and hold the most stock . Over 250,000 of the share owners arc Bell telephone employees . Some 85 per cent of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these direct owners of A.T &T; securities , many millions of other people have an important , beneficial interest through the holdings of their insurance companies , pension funds , investment companies , unions , savings banks , etc . The total of direct and indirect owners represents the great majority of all the families in the country . A.T &T; share owners , and the owners of A.T . &T; bonds , are the financial foundation of our ability to serve . For without the money they have put in the business you would not have the quality and quantity of telephone service you enjoy today . Nor would there he work and wages for 735,000 employees . Obviously , investors will continue to supply capital in the amounts required for present and future needs only if they can expect the Bell System to earn a return on the money they invest that is reasonable in comparison with the earnings rates of other companies and industries . So telephone progress , and the advantage to all that comes from pushing ahead , begins with good earnings and our faith that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair profit . That is the way of life which in our country has stimulated invention , nourished enterprise , created jobs , raised living standards and built our national strength . As long as we live by this principle ? and earnings are sufficient to enable us to carry it out  --  the future of the telephone is almost limitless in possibilities for service to you . This is the Life I Love for example , membership on the board of The Fund for the Republic . Harry was convinced from the start that 1 could make a go of Newsday . That l failed to inherit control of the Daily News does n't mean a thing to me any more , for Newsday is more fun to edit and to publish . We have never succumbed to the stuffed-shirt approach to life ; we have never been scared of a fight . The paper is like me , for I am a temperamental person , with violent likes and dislikes . This note of stubbornness has come down through my family from James Patrick , an Ulster Scots-Irishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tuscarawas Chronicle to the pioneer families of Ohio . As a child and as a young woman , an Irish determination to have my own way got me into trouble constantly ; and when 1 was n't in trouble on my own , father was brewing up some for me . He had wanted a boy , instead of three daughters in succession , and that meant one of the Patterson girls would have to be his substitute son . My older sister Elinor , three years my senior , was a rather withdrawn child who kindled no spark in father 's lusty soul . Josephine , seven years my junior , was too young to be a full-time companion . My brother Jimmy , now an assistant managing editor of the New York Daily News , was not born until some years later . Pa talked me , as a substitute son , into taking horses over far higher jumps than I preferred ; made me one day stand trembling on a diving board for five hours until I could summon up nerve to leap into the swimming pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be scared . Long after 1 had grown up , father continued to exert an almost hypnotic influence on me. 1 would have died rather than fail him . On one trip to the Panama Canal Zone , father discovered that the best tarpon fishing was to be had at Gatun Dam , a structure 150 feet high that diverts the canal waters into a series of locks . The only way to catch one of those huge fish was to wade out atop the dam , knee-deep in rushing water , and then to cast over the edge to the rocks at the base of the spillway . This entertaining gambit , I was informed , killed about ten persons per year . At the time , I was convalescing from a serious operation . Dr. Harold Meeker , the family physician , had warned father not to let me exert myself . " Alicia , " father said to me , " go out on the dam and try to hook a tarpon . " I waded through the roaring torrent and dutifully cast until I hooked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward me , a mixture of love and hate , a desire to test my nervous system to the snapping point . All I know is that he helped to make me unafraid . I felt at times like the Spartan boy who kept silent though the fox was gnawing at his vitals . People who do not know me very well assume I grew up rich from the start . In fact , father was nearly broke when I was born , in 1906 , and we were living on a basic income of thirty-five dollars a week . He had left the family paper , the Chicago Tribune , and for two years had been art active member of the Socialist Party . His family had cut him off , His small inheritance went into a Georgian house , a 400-acre farm , and a woebegone herd of Holstein cows out on the prairie at Libertyville , northwest of Chicago . My mother was born Alice Higinbotham , and her father had been president of the 1893 Chicago World 's Fair . ( Continued from Pagc 21 ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ) erosional , grudging check , achieved after much pitiful pleading from father . This money came from his highly irritated mother , the former Elinor Medill Patterson . My own mother took it gallantly , even though she would have preferred a more conventional life . In fact , she took everything gallantly , from riding to hounds to going up in an old " box car " plane , circa 1911 . Father always said she was the bravest woman in the world . Father never got over his passion for the underdog , which in his later life reflected itself in the pages of the Daily News . As a Socialist , he wrote any number of books and plays , among them A Little Brother of the Rich , a novel that eventually became a play and ran for six weeks on Broadway . Appropriately , ii dealt with a young man who gave the heave-ho to the idle life and became a crusading member of society . To be a Socialist in those days was about equal to being a Communist now . Mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter how she felt about it all . " 1 do n't know what being a Socialist is , " she said , " but if that is what my husband is , I 'm for it . " As a child , I was not attractive . My hair dangled over my face in lank strands . When introduced to a visitor , I tipped my face sideways and looked sullen . Elinor , by contrast , was a shining blonde , with blue eyes and complete self-possession She was always the one who wore the blue sash and made the curtsy . I made up my mind that if I could n't match Elinor in manners , I 'd outdo her in meanness . Josephine shares my philosophy , and we are as close as sisters can be . She now is married to the famous artist , Ivan Albright , and lives much of the year on a ranch in Dubois , Wyoming . In the early 1950 's , when I underwent a really grave abdominal operation , 1 completely lost the will to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat by my bedside for hours at a time and cussed me out as a yellowbelly until I got so mad I decided to " show her . " The cult of toughness traveled each winter to Chicago , when the family moved from Libertyville to a hotel on the near north side . I sneaked rides on ice wagons , played hooky from Francis Parker School to see the vaudeville at McVickers Theatre , and constantly found myself up before the principal . This led me to be transferred to the University School , where a family joke was born . Father was a sloppy dresser , who preferred to wear sweat shirts , a cap and baggy pants . One day he brought me to school and bade me farewell . The headmistress promptly called up mother . " Mrs. Patterson , " she said in a shocked voice , " I just saw your houseman kissing your daughter . " Father in 1911 abjured Socialism to rejoin the Chicago Tribune , which sobered him down , but only speeded me up . At age thirteen I was retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after hours ; at age fourteen I was bounced from St. Timothy 's , in Maryland , for general obstreperousness . To everyone 's amazement , however , when 1 transferred to Foxcroft School , at Middleburg , Virginia , I graduated second in my class . My family 's hopes were promptly shattered when they sent me to Rome for further finishing . With six other girls , I climbed over a wall topped with broken glass and sneaked off to a caf ? . The offenders were easily spotted the followjag morning by scratched and bloody Nails . and once more I was Alicia in search of a school , After assorted other European escapades , with mother exerting a desperate sort of supervision over me , father cabled , " keep Alicia moving . " She moved me back to Chicago , where at age nineteen I " came out " at a wingding of a party at the Blackstone Hotel , complete with the chorus of the Tiller Girls , the 1920 version of the Rockettes , and Ray Dooley , the musical-comedy star . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent profession . One day , white visiting father in New York  --  he had moved there from Chicago in 925 , leaving mother to keep track of me  --  I announced , in a lad-di-da voice , " I 'd lore to have a career . " I started a career the next morning , in the Daily News office at 25 Park Place . Since then , the paper has built its own skyscraper on East 42nd Street . Upon my startled eyes there burst an entirely new kind of life . There were giants on the News . Max Annenberg was the circulation manager , a tough-talking ex-boxer with a soft spot in his heart for me . Harvey ? melt was the city editor , a fabulous extrovert who could coax the best out of any reporter or writer . Mark Mellinger was the night-life columnist . And I was in the corner clipping out filler items from other newspapers for use in the Sunday News . Almost the first news story I covered involved the paper in a stupendous libel suit . I pinned the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lusty era , I stayed up all night at the neighborhood speakeasies . This did not please father . I was summoned to a luncheon at which the only other guest was his cousin , Col. Robert R. McCormick , publisher of the Chicago Tribune . They fired me from the News , jointly , and shipped me back to Chicago awash in tears . The family may have hoped that I had settled down , and indeed it appeared so when in 1927 I married James Simpson , Jr. , whose father was president of Marshall Field 's , but this mating turned out to be a self-canceling contest of wills . We separated at the end of a year . To forget , 1 traveled for miles into the interior of Indochina , where I shot a very elusive , dangerous and grouchy horned animal called a sladttag : and after returning to civilization in 1930 obtained a divorce . With a patient but wearied air of desperation , father put me to work writing articles , mostly on flying , for Liberty Magatine . This phenomenal money-loser cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , it did bring about my marriage to a line aviator and sportsman , Joseph W , Brooks , Flying to me was a glorious experience , and flying with Joe an education , But as the years went on , 1 began to feel restive about a life based on sports . Joe and I grew apart , and were divorced in 1938 . I married Harry soon after . He started the ball rolling on my newspaper career , by commissioning Max Annenberg to look for a paper . Max found one at Hempstead , Long Island . The paper had closed down , because of labor trouble , after publishing only ten days . Harry bought its two secondhand presses for 550,000 . Father did n't think much of the idea . He rather grumpily said that Long Island would n't take a tabloid . He added that I 'd be crazy if I thought he would sell me any of the successful News-Tribune comic strips , such as Dick Tracy or the Gumps : " I would n't give them to anyone else in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Father 's idea of a tabloid did not jibe with mine . I did n't want a sensational paper or a carbon copy of the News . My good friend Janet Chase was married to Fred Hauck , one of the most brilliant typographical experts in the United States , The paper Fred designed for us was clean and crisp , and subsequently won three F. Wayland Ayer awards for excellent typography . The latest news , with sometimes a picture , was spread out on the front and back pages in large and readable type . The inside pages were laid out for the reader 's benefit rather than the advertiser 's . Either a page was solid advertising or it contained a minimum of two columns of news , with no indigestible gleanings from the National Geographic Magazine about the graveyard of the elephants in Tanganyika or the height of the Washington Monument . A paper must have advertising to make a profit and keep running , but I refuse to indulge in any genuflections ( Continued on Page 50 ) T ( Continued from Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that Newsday frequently publishes issues of 128 or more pages , 1 still insist that the reader get the break . Those were rugged days . The presses broke down regularly . Our editorial staff of less than twenty-five had to queue up for the available desks and typewriters . The cartoonist and editorial writer worked in the composing room , alongside the typesetting machines . My first office had no windows , and reminded me of the black hole of Calcutta . The floor was so cold in winter that 1 kept my feet in a desk drawer or in the wastebasket . When war came , in December , 1941 , all newspapers were rationed on the basis of mid-1941 circulation . Ours was then slightly over 26,000 . Newsday had grown so much that we were in a desperate dilemma . We resolved it by rationing advertising space for the duration of the war . It was not easy for me to stay at a newspaper desk while the world was exploding . Father had been an artillery captain in World War I , and had convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peril . I considered joining Jacqueline Cochran in England , whose women fliers were ferrying planes from factories to air bases . This martial ardor was well dampened by Harry , who had been a distinguished naval aviator in the first war . " I 'm going back in the service , " he said to me . " You stay home and tend the store . " Though overage , he rejoined the Navy , and again acquitted himself with distinction , first as commandant of Mercer Field , New Jersey , near Trenton , and later from a carrier as machine gunner on naval air raids against Japanese positions in the Pacific . This risky performance was not unlike the risks taken by his old friend , Charles A. Lindbergh. as a civilian , in piloting an Army plane against the Japs . In fact , Lindbergh wrote his book , We , at our home , Falaise , at Sands Point , on the north shore of Long Island . That was before my marriage to Harry . While Harry was gone , tending the store became quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and photo services . Sometimes , in desperation , we would photograph a picture that appeared in a city paper and reprint it blurrily . This I trust will be forgiven as petty larceny . The credit for carrying us through those stormy days should not go to me , but to the men who are now executives of the paper  --  Alan Hathway , managing editor ; Jack Mullen , circulation director ; Ernie Levy , the advertising manager , who cheerfully threw out all ads though it curdled his soul ; and Alan Woods , production manager . Joining them after the war was Harold Ferguson , then comptroller and now business manager . Harry , after taking a serious look at our red figures , brought in Harold , who had been an auditor in some of the Guggenheim enterprises . These five executives , all of whom came up from the bottom at Newsday , join with Harry and me at a weekly meeting to discuss policy and problems . To illustrate how we did things during the war , there was the case of the cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the American Cancer Society had asked me to break down . We could n't get a single professional model to pose . The series involved a loving wife , an afflicted husband , a compassionate doctor , and two tiny children . I was the loving wife ; Hathway was the husband ; Bill Page , then general manager , was the doctor ; and we borrowed the children of one of our reporters . The pictures were a wow , and the series was a huge success . Looming over us , all through this period , was a newspaper called the // Nassau Daily Review-Star , published in Rockville Centre , Long Island . The Review-Star was originally owned by James E. Stiles , but later in part by the S. I. Newhouse interests , which publish a number of other papers , and had a circulation of 35,000 . It was old , respectable , fuddy-duddy and to me wholly unreadable . When the Review-Star woke up , Newsday was too far out in front to be headed . The Newhouses suspended the Review-Star in 1953 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in the Borough of Queens , a subdi-vision of New York City directly west of us . What put Newsday in an unbeatable position , if I may venture an immodest opinion , was guts . We have never been ashamed to stand up and fight for what we believe ; to yell and holler and pound the table , and if knocked down to get up from the floor and start fighting again , We are not too high-toned to indulge in a little of the old cornball , or you may prefer to call it schmaltz . Sex and divorce stories do not scare us . Most of our readers grew up in the big and hard-boiled city . We do n't handle such items , if newsworthy , with a pair of fire tongs , nor do we lick our chops over them . When a story justifies it , we weep real tears or indulge in real belly-laughs . This should not be construed as a suggestion that we sneer at eggheads or culture . A year ago , the distinguished philosopher Aldous Huxley wrote for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appraisal of the damage that subliminal advertising and psychological propaganda are doing to free peoples . Our readers liked it because we had not talked down to them . We were flooded with requests for reprints , which we supplied at ten cents a copy . The end result  --  and , after all , the essential result of all successful publishing ventures  --  was that we turned a profit on the deal . We are politically independent , which on occasion causes me to disagree with my devotedly Eisenhower-Republican husband . Harry served as Ambassador to Cuba under President Herbert Hoover , and on numerous diplomatic and economic missions . Therefore , when Franklin Roosevelt ran for a third term , against Wendell Willkie , Harry and I split the opposite-editorial page in the middle . On one side , my editorials supported F.D.R. On the other , his signed editorials asked votes for Willkie . We have not since resorted to this technique , but should we ever differ again , which is highly possible , we wo n't be ashamed to repeat the procedure . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Newsday was first to propose that Dwight Eisenhower be drafted to run for President . When he ran for a second term , we switched sides and backed my friend from girlhood . Adlai E. Stevenson . Not by design but by conviction , Newsday keeps the readers guessing . As to Newsday 's crusades , these have embraced such varied items as preserving Walt Whitman 's birthplace ; eliminating " Dogdom 's Dachau , " meaning a brutally run dog pound ; and electing a Democrat to Congress from rock-ribbed Republican Suffolk County . This involved the defeat of the county 's boss , Congressman W. Kingsland Macy . In his own weekly newspapers , Mr , Macy revenged himself with cartoons in which I was portrayed as a witch stirring an evil caldron and labeled " Malicia " Patterson . He also had me summoned before a congressional committee on the charge that Newsday had financed part of his opponent 's campaign . The accusation was disproved . The best and longest crusade of all won us the Pulitzer Prize for Meritorious Pubtic Service in 1954 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once you have sunk your teeth into a good story . " In this case , the teeth were provided by Alan pathway . As managing editor he is , if anything , even more stubborn than I am . For three years , Alan pounded away in the news columns at William C. Dc Koning , Sr. , boss in Nassau County of Operating Engineers ' Union . The stories proved that De Koning was shaking down his own union members , as well as the employees of the trotting track at Roosevelt Raceway , by forcing them to join a social club and by other more devious means . De Koning was convicted of extortion and sent to prison for a year , and we got the Pulitzer prize . There are exceptions to every rule , however , and failing to let go of a story mixed us up for years with Butch . He was a large-eyed , floppy-eared , sad-looking St. Bernard that used to board the Long Island Rail Road train daily at Glen Cove and ride out to Oyster Bay , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural ; we gave it all we had .

We commemorated the day with a sorrowful cartoon . " My Son , My Son , " in which Butch , Sr. , looked down from dog heavenon his scalawag offspring . A Butch 111 was inevitable . I bought him from a kennel and turned him over to the embarrassed mayor of Glen Cove , Luke Mercadante , who then became known as " the dog mayor . " Butch Ill , regrettably , hated children and bit them at every opportunity . For once without publicity . I crated Butch and shipped him to Josephine , in Wyoming . He promptly bit one of her children . Perhaps we were to blame . We were constantly dolling Butch up in hats and posing him for special pictures  --  enough to give any self-respecting dog a trauma Finally , an infuriated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butch business for six years , and proposes to stay out . This kind of journalism , while not exactly in the vein of either the News or the Chicago Tribune , was close enough to obtain for me the appreciative attention or my cousin , " Uncle Bert " McCormick . As a newspaperwoman , I had his approval . As a Patterson , I was somewhat suspect . Before his death a few years ago , I was present one day at a cocktail party of Daily News and Tribune executives when he remarked : " Of course the Pattersons were all descended from Scottish cattle rustlers , but / ( underlined ) am the descendant of Virginia gentlemen , " Still fixed by his glassy eye , I made the best retort that came to my mind : " Well , you have to be damned smart , Uncle Bert , to be a cattle rustler in Scotland .

My job is to make Newsday readable , entertaining , comprehensive , informative , interpretive , lively , but still sufficiently serious-minded so that no Long Islander will feel compelled to read any New York City paper . My husband 's equally complex job is basically to conserve our profits , which are substantial , for future expansion , and to supervise the business end of this enterprise . This is a family business , in which Harry owns 51 per cent of the stock and 1 own 49 per cent , and we do not make our earnings public . We do n't owe anyone a cent ; we plow the profits back into the paper . At the rate the Long Island population continues to grow , I see no limit to News-day 's future .

Alice , a freshman at Radcliffe College , is trying out for the editorial board of the neighboring Harvard Crimson . I hope both of them have the spark , but it will take hard work on their part to prove it to me . You ca n't make a business out of pleasure , but there 's more pleasure in newspapering than in any other business in the world .
