Among U.S. shippers , the Isbrandtsen Steamship Line is a lone sea wolf . The biggest independent line operator in the world , Isbrandtsen has fought governments around the globe in the name of freedom of the seas , has battled fellow shippers to establish free rates . Last week , after a ten-year battle , Isbrandtsen recorded the most important victory in its log book . Ruling in Isbrandtsen 's favor , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the rate-setting practices of the international shipping conferences-voluntary groups of U.S. and foreign lines-thus opening the way for a flurry of price-cutting . <P> About half the 112 freight shipping conferences operating in U.S. foreign trade try to freeze out the independent shippers by a " dual rate " policy , i.e. , rates up to 10% lower than standard for customers who use only conference ships . Isbrandtsen has refused to join such conferences , holding that they are cartels that add to the cost of foreign trade and discourage free competition . In the early 1950s the line captured 30% of cargoes between Japan and the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by setting prices 10% below those of the Japan-Atlantic &; Gulf Freight Conference , a group of 17 predominantly Japanese and U.S. lines . To meet Isbrandtsen 's competition , the conference got U.S. Maritime Board approval of a dual-rate system . <P> Tough Isbrandtsen Founder Hans Isbrandtsen challenged the legality of the dual rate , fought it through many courts before he died in 1953 . Since then , the company has carried on his battle under . the leadership of his son Jakob , 36 , now company president . The Department of Agriculture , which ships huge quantities of surplus food , and the Justice Department joined the fray-but on Isbrandtsen 's side . <P> When the Supreme Court ruled that dual rates are unlawful when designed to " stifle outside competition , " it left the Maritime Board a small loophole : it can decide in each individual case . Nevertheless , the shipping interests fear that shippers will break loose from the conferences , fight the independents in an all-out price war for cargoes . U.S. lines would be particularly hurt by such a war because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shippers are likely to pull out of the conferences right away . Four hours after the court handed down its decision . Maryland 's Republican Senator John Marshall Butler introduced a bill in Congress to make the dual rates legal . Powerful shipping interests will push the bill hard , but it will probably not get a hearing in this session of Congress .
