" Son of a Newmarket racing family . Keeps horses himself . Breeds pigs . Born while parents were staying within one mile of Bow Bells , making him officially a cockney* . . . Calls all policemen and editors ' Sir . ' Avoids all children under the age of 30 . " <P> Thus pale , frail , one-eyed Carl Giles , 36 , famed cartoonist for Lord Beaverbrook 's London Daily Express ( circ. 4,222,000 ) describes himself in a book of his cartoons just published by the Express . But most Fleet-Streeters-and Express readers-would describe Giles more simply as , next to David Low , the best cartoonist in Britain . Even Americans , often baffled by British humor , think Giles is funny , and his cartoons now appear in 22 Canadian and eight U.S. newspapers . <P> Rare Boys . Giles likes to say that the only art training he ever got was in scrawling naughty words on automobiles in the London working-class suburb of Islington , where he grew up . ( His " racing family " refers to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got a job sharpening pencils and carrying tea to movie-cartoon animators in Alexander Korda 's film company , got his bosses to let him trace some of the smaller details in the thousands of drawings that go to make up a sequence . He taught himself drawing so well that in 1937 Reynolds News gave him a job as a cartoonist . His work caught the eye of the Beaver , who took him over in 1943 . Overnight , Giles won a huge following in wartime Britain , notably American soldiers , who liked his good-humored pot shots at their habits . At a time when Americans were monopolizing London taxis , Giles cartooned an American plane which had just crashed into a German house . Its crew , standing a few feet away , was shouting : " Taxi ! " Another showed G.I.s hauling away Big Ben 's clock on an Army truck while a grinning cockney remarked : " Rare boys for souvenirs , these Americans . " Two years ago , on his first visit to the U.S. , Giles took playful pokes at everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guy is nuts . Says thank you ! " ) He also has fun with Americans abroad ( see cut ) . <P> A Proper Importance . Although Giles now makes enough money to indulge his passion for cars ( he lost the sight of his right eye in a motor accident ) and to live on a prosperous farm in Suffolk , he has not forgotten his working-class origins . Londoners like best his stock characters , such as cockneys , hard-boiled moppets ( one proudly reported that he had not only spotted spring 's first cuckoo , but shot it with his air rifle ) and the Giles " family . " This includes beefy , solid Dad and Mum , a scrawny pig-tailed schoolgirl , two older homely sisters , a horrid , runty little boy and stumpy , grumpy Grandma who smells of camphorated oil and dotes on " bulls ' eyes " ( a peppermint candy ) . <P> His ugly working-class characters combine good nature , impudence and long-suffering patience with a proper English sense of a citizen 's importance . Example : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his shoulder , strides past a cluster of bristling generals to inspect a parade-dress line of soldiers . Giles 's caption : " His argument is that as a taxpayer he has as much right to inspect things as anybody else . " <P> <P> * By definition , anyone born within the sound of the bells of Bow Church .
