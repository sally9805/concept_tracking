Every true space cadet knows that the famous , 4,000-ft-wide crater near Winslow , Ariz , was made by a giant meteorite . <P> The U.S. Board of Geographic Names calls it " Meteor Crater " Airliners fly over it to show it to passengers , and the tourists it draws nourish a woebegone part of arid Arizona . <P> But science can not let well enough alone . In the Bulletin of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists , Geologist Dorsey Hager attempts to prove that Meteor Crater is nothing but an ancient sinkhole that just happened to get peppered , late in its life , by a swarm of meteorites . According to Hager , Meteor Crater started as a steep-sided dome thrust upward several million years ago by geological forces . Its rock was splintered by distortion , and water penetrated to " evaporite " ( salt ) beds far below it . After millions of years , the water removed a lot of this soluble stuff , leaving enormous caverns . At last the roof fell in and parts of the walls tumbled after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Hager , about 200,000 years ago . Much later , a great swarm of meteorites littered the pit and its vicinity with nickel-iron fragments . <P> It was this extraordinary coincidence , says Hager , that made the meteorite theory seem so plausible . <P> Hager , no conscious spoilsport , bases his argument on elaborate geological studies of the crater 's surroundings . Except for the presence of meteoritic material , he says , there is little or no evidence to prove that the mound or the depression in its center is of meteoric origin . One of his strongest points is that the sides of the mound are made largely of white sand arranged in regular beds . This seems to point to the slow action of normal erosion , not to the sudden impact of a meteorite hitting the earth . Another strong point is that no large mass of meteoritic material has ever been detected below the bed of the crater . <P> Hager 's theory has weaknesses , too . The rim of the crater shows great limestone blocks that look exactly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion . And the long arm of coincidence had to strain itself to deposit so much meteoritic material on the only spot in the U.S. <P> that looks as if a great meteorite had hit it .
