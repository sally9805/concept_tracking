The first few questions thrown at French Premier Guy Mollet as he descended from a plane at Orly Field last week were about his U.S. visit . Then French newsmen got down to what they regarded as more important : What would the Premier do about the bill in the National Assembly to raise the price of milk half a cent a quart ? To an aide Mollet testily commented : " How can I return from high policy talks with Eisenhower and ask for a vote of confidence on milk ? " <P> There was only one characteristically French way to stave off such a humiliating anticlimax : the Premier called in the leaders of the dairy bloc and promised an eventual rise in milk prices , if they would not demand one now . Mollet had special reason to worry about milk ; it is one of the 213 items on France 's official cost-of-living index . For weeks the index has hovered around 149 . The day it hits 149.1 , legal minimum wages all over France will jump 5% , triggering eventual pay increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Stewpots . In the past year France 's high cost of living has gone up an estimated 8.5% . Every Frenchman feels the pinch of inflation , but the index does not show it because of Finance Minister Paul Ramadier 's artful policy of " dipping the thermometer in cold water . " The index is based on the Paris price of 213 commodities which include tennis balls , long underwear and iron stewpots , but do not include gasoline or green vegetables ( up 33% in the past year ) . Seventeen times in the past ten months , as the index trembled toward 149.1 , white-goateed Socialist Ramadier forced it down by devices ranging from a 20% slash in the Paris price of government-owned cooking gas to abolition of the tax which Parisians pay for street cleaning and trash collection . <P> Successful as these manipulations were in stalling off the dreaded wage increase , they have cost the government an estimated $195 million a year , in increased subsidies and lost taxes , at a time when the government needs every franc it can lay hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported raw materials-aggravated by the post-Suez necessity of buying U.S. " dollar oil " - has cut French gold and foreign-exchange reserves from $1.7 billion to $934 million . Between the Algerian war ( daily cost : about $3,000,000 ) and increased old-age pensions , this year 's national budget shows a record $3.5 billion deficit . <P> Half Frozen . The usual remedies for such difficulties are to cut expenditures or raise taxes . Instead the Socialist government has chosen an easy way to manage its debts . Two weeks ago , to help finance oil imports , a group of French banks negotiated a $100 million loan from a U.S. syndicate headed by Chase Manhattan Bank . Last week Ramadier himself introduced a $285 million government bond issue on terms so generous that it will cost the government $20 million a year in interest and bonuses , and investors lucky enough to hold the first bonds retired stand to earn a fat 15% on their money .
