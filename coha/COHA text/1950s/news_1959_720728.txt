txt Hope springs eternal  --  and anew  --  in Alaska . The thrill and satisfaction of statehood have nourished the feeling that perhaps Alaska 's breakthrough into more adequate development of its immense natural resources may be not far ahead . But at the same time , there is an awareness that statehood has brought new problems . No longer does the paternal hand of Washington intervene and guide , and the decisions taken in Juneau are sometimes bold and expensive . Meantime , as 1959 's short summer ends , the houses and industrial plants and commercial buildings which have not been completed because of a carpenters ' strike stare you in the face in every inhabited place . Now they can not be finished during this brief building season , and before the winter is over the economic effects may be severe . . But Alaska will pull itself together next spring , and push forward under the constant , exhilarating stimulus of the riches of nature which are so grandly apparent . Oil prospecting is taking place all over the state . Valued metals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope  --  not very well based  --  that perhaps an increase in the price of gold might give the gold-mining industry a badly needed boost . Arctic Enthralls Visitor Military expenditures continue to stimulate the Alaskan economy , The summertime . trade is bound ' to grow . A governmental commission is studying how to build a highway or railroad up along the coast from Puget Sound . The Canadians in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory are planning hard  --  toward the development of the immense power and mineral resources which are tied in with Alaska , and need to cross Alaska on the way to tidewater . The Peace River project alone is breath-taking , and the Yukon remains a great untamed giant . For the visitor like myself , Alaska is a magnificent experience . My introduction was thrilling . Flying from Seattle to just . south of Ketchikan , where the long Alaskan panhandle reaches to the British Columbia coast , the skies were overcast . But as we reached Ketchikan , the clouds had broken , and from there to Juneau it was 200 miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a forest fire had never struck , snow-capped mountains and mighty glaciers , deep inlets and fiords  --  all were primitive and untouched . Then , the following day , flying from Fairbanks to Nome and Kotzebue , and spending the night in a little Eskimo village on Bering Strait , was a glimpse of the Arctic which enthralls . Here in Kotzebue , we are a hundred miles or.so from Little and Big Diomede Islands . Big Diomede is in the U.S.S.R. , the other side of the international dateline . I have just been talking with some of the Little Diomede Island Eskimos , who will soon start their trek back home for the winter . I asked . one little boy : " Where would you rather live , here in Kotzebue with all the other people and the coming and going of tourists ( perhaps 50 daily ! ) or out on Diomede ? " Without an instant 's hesitation , he replied : " Diomede . " And so I concluded that the Eskimos are not being altogether spoiled in their contact with the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly a delightful people . On Sunday morning , here in Kotzebue , I went to the Friends ' Meeting House , because most of the Eskimos went there . The service was largely composed of hymn singing , and there was no sermon . Three Eskimos , two men and a woman , told simply and with feeling what finding the Christ had meant to them . And all the Eskimos sang with open throats , pouring out the old gospel hymns they have learned to love so well . There was no collection , but we contributed . The Friends have just finished a fine high-school building for the Eskimos at Kotzebue . Hitherto , all pupils have gone more than 1,000 miles away to the high school at Mt . Edgecomb , Sitka , where they stayed all winter , The friendliness and cooperation of the Eskimos were very apparent . They need these qualities , for life in the Arctic barrens demands all of man 's spiritual resources . But they love it , and find deep beauty in their land and its way of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buy much the same groceries at the stores that ' we do  --  at a markup . Nome , which is the American town nearest the Soviet Union , lives under the shadow of impending-termination of gold-dredging activities . But there is tin a little way down the coast , and possible oilfields not far away , - and plenty of gold to be dredged if the price improves . There is no highway into Nome , ships have to be lightered and do n't come very often , and defense activities seem largely to have passed Nome by . Air Bases Dominate Cities Citizens remember the days of World War II , when the Japanese had attacked Dutch Harbor , and Nome officials were told they would have to defend themselves . They mounted a small fieldpiece on a truck , and drove round and round the town 's one or two streets and water front . But the Japanese never came . The Soviets did come , however , during the long period of the trans-Siberian airlift . Nome 's memories of the Soviets seem to be largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as its people gaze across Bering Strait and can almost see the Soviet planes lift off their bases on the other side . They know there is abundant United States defense , but it is a long way back from their beachhead . In Anchorage , the atmosphere is all defense , and so it is at Fairbanks , the interior metropolis , Huge air bases dominate these cities . Both are also on major commercial air routes over the pole from the Orient to Europe . They are on the main street , of intercontinental travel . Each is growing fast and steadily , but terribly hampered through the carpenters ' strike . Each , incidentally , has fine newspapers with active civic policies . These papers had a great deal to do with the successful fight for statehood . Nome , likewise , has a newspaper : the Nome Nugget , published twice . a week under the active editorial and publishing hand of Emily Boucher . It was such a pleasure to talk with her in her two-room shop on Nome 's frontier main street . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first set type and ran a job press . What a vast , specticular , challenging land ! Timber enough to print all the world 's newspapers and build most of its houses ! Water power enough to provide all the energy a vast industry could possibly require . Minerals to serve that industry . Petroleum and natural gas , evidently in great abundance . Land still to be homesteaded and raise a fair crop . Beauty and game sports at every doorstep . The wholesome life of the small , struggling , proud , cooperating community . An excellent university . Churches and clubs and civic life . And lots of places , not far away or inaccessible , where perhaps man has never before set foot . Alaska 's breakthrough will come . Meantime , it copes with the problems of statehood after the first exhilaration has worn away . It is AmeriCa 's perpetual physical frontier : a sample of our national past , preserved in 1959 . It smells and feels much as Maine must have done in 1850 , Michigan in 1900 , Oregon aria Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things move faster nowadays . So they will for Alaska , but we can not foresee when or just how .
