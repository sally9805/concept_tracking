Now that the furor among press and public over the Le Mans disaster has subsided and officials have had time to consider sober action to prevent a recurrence of such fearful accidents , where does automobile racing stand in Europe ? // France 's action  --  the banning of all races and rallies on roads until a new set of safety regulations has been drafted  --  was by far the most drastic , and few other European nations have shown much alacrity in following the French lead . Where other promoting clubs do appear to be doing so , it is very likely due to other reasons . For instance , the provisional cancellation of the Swiss Grand Prix at Bern August 21 may have been inspired by the $18,000 loss sustained by the Swiss Auto Club in last year 's event . The same holds true of the Spanish Grand Prix at Barcelona , which probably will not be held October 23 , although no official announcement has yet been made by the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce , which stages the event for the Automobile Club of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , would require costly changes to meet the proposed new safety standards . In any event , the Spanish Grand Prix is not a regular annual fixture . It was held in 1954 after a two-year layoff. // Italy , which did ban all road racing after Le Mans , has now relented . The Italian Grand Prix will definitely be held as scheduled at the Monza track on September 11 . Road races announced on the calendar may be run without reference to the authorities , provided competing cars are limited to two liters engine displacement . This includes the grueling Dolomite Gold Cup run on July 10 . Where road races involve cars of over two liters , permission must be sought from the CSI ( International Sporting Commission ) through which the FIA ( International Automobile Federation ) exercises worldwide governing power . The CSI , however , regards the safety of road courses as an individual national problem and is not attempting to lay down hard-and-fast rules in this respect . Thus , next year 's Mille Miglia will be held as usual and may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road races in the Continental sense , but the British Grand Prix to be held at Aintree near Liverpool July 16 is unaffected and now assumes far greater importance . The field will feature 24 entries , including leading Continental makes  --  Mercedes , Ferrari , Maserati , Gordini , plus British Vanwalls ( new Grand Prix jobs ) and Connaughts . The Royal Automobile Club has set up a special safety committee under Lord Brabazon to study problems connected with crowd safety at race events , but since British races are held on airfields or special closed courses , nothing very drastic is expected . The RAC special committee appears more as a gesture of sympathy and endorsement , while the French wrestle with their own problems . In France two inquiries are in progress  --  a judicial one into causes and responsibilities for the Le Mans disaster , and that of a government-appointed safety precautions committee struggling with the ticklish question of how far to enforce crowd and driver safety measures recommended by the Ministers of Interior , Health and Transport . The French government may be wondering whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its total ban of racing events . First official announcement regarding cancellation of the French Grand Prix at Rheims July 3 was made June 22 . It simply states that the Grand Prix was postponed " indefinitely . " A week later , however , came another official statement : " It is now hoped the race will be held before the end of the season . " A persistent rumor sets August 21 as the new date , presumably to replace the canceled Swiss Grand Prix , but nothing is definite . The Automobile Club of Champagne , which owns the permanent road circuit of Rheims and is delegated to run this event by the Automobile Club of France , finds itself in a serious quandary . A big oil and gas corporation ( BP Energol ) has sunk 78 million francs into the French Grand Prix . Almost certainly , therefore , the race will go on later . // AN IMPRESSION FOR THE PUBLIC The general impression among informed club officials and active race drivers is that what comes out of these various safety committees is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and furious deliberation . Western German opinion , represented largely by Mercedes-Benz , is content to let this famous firm act as the arbiter of safety measures in racing . Mercedes lays blame for the Le Mans accident squarely on Mike Hawthorn 's Jaguar , but has come up with some good ideas for crowd and driver safety , such as the one at Zandvoort ( SI , July 4 ) . The German racing calendar is unaffected . The German Grand Prix will be held at Nurburgring as planned , July 31 , on that famous course which affords all the thrills of auto road racing at its very best while providing ideal safety for the spectators .
