After the dinner hour one quiet evening last week , Demo-Christian Deputy Oscar Scalfaro stood up in the Italian Chamber of Deputies and made a motion : let the House sit seven days a week to speed debate on the government 's electoral reform bill . Up popped Socialist Fellow Traveler Pietro Nenni to cry : " The majority is attempting a coup . " Communist Boss Palmiro Togliatti , discarding his usual pose of blue-serge respectability , shouted : " This is n't a Parliament . It is a bivouac of priests . " From the right came the reply : " Go back to your Soviet Parliament , Togliatti . Your game will be up there . " The fight was on . <P> Narrow Margins . As the two sides of the House made for each other , shouting curses and grabbing handy weapons , the speaker summoned help on a siren called la Martinella . A phalanx of strapping ushers rushed in . Prohibited from laying hands on the honorable members , the thin line of frock-coated ushers compromised by kicking shins . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drinking glasses hurtling , chair legs thudding on skulls . From his seventh-row plush seat , Red Chief Togliatti , carefully guarded by a Red deputy , watched with a connoisseur 's interest . Premier Alcide de Gasperi , 71 , in the front benches , prudently retired to safer ground . <P> The scuffle was part of a deadly earnest battle between De Gasperi 's government and its powerful Communist opposition ( 128 members ) . An election is coming with spring ; the Demo-Christians expect to win by a hair ( Italy is the only nation in Western Europe where the Communists have gained strength since 1948 ) . Narrow margins might be tolerated in England , where the opposition is democratic ; but could Italian democracy survive and effectively govern if the Communists really controlled Parliament ? <P> De Gasperi 's electoral reform bill proposed that the winning party or coalition of parties be given a bonus of additional seats , sufficient to give it at least 63% of the total number of seats , enough for a working majority . If passing the bill was important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reds . <P> Cracked Heads . Communist Walter Audisio , who likes to boast that he was Mussolini 's executioner , sped to the clerk 's table , ripped away a microphone , scared off the clerks and tore up the parliamentary minutes . Spying an elderly Demo-Christian deputy who was grabbing an antique clock to save it , Audisio clubbed him to the floor . Tough Demo-Christian Deputy Giuseppe Bettiol tore the leg off a chair , advanced on Audisio and beat him into retreat . <P> After 20 minutes , peace returned to the chamber , now slopped with ink and blood and littered with glass shards , torn paper and shredded shirts . One usher went to the hospital with a brain concussion ; a Red sported a two-inch-deep gash in his scalp ; a Demo-Christian nursed a badly bruised abdomen ; the House first-aid station impartially bandaged Red heads and court-plastered Demo-Christian faces . <P> The next morning , both sides proffered formal apologies . Deputies noted that their desks had been fastened to the floor , and inkwells prudently removed .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
