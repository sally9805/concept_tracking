Lieut . General Alexander von Falkenhausen , sentenced to twelve years at hard labor last month on charges of war crimes committed while he was military governor of Belgium , last week was a free man . The Belgian government released the 72-year-old prisoner , after crediting him with the six years served before he came to trial .

" As for German participation in European defense : " I ca n't imagine myself fighting shoulder to shoulder with contingents whose military leaders today condemn German generals . " Into the " visitors ' book " at the German frontier post , Falkenhausen-who claims that he had tried to help the Belgians ( TIME , March 19 ) - wrote : " Ingrata Belgia , non possidebis ossa mea Ungrateful Belgium , you shall not possess my bones .

On his tomb , he ordered the inscription : " Ingrata patria , ne ossa quidem habebis Ungrateful fatherland , you shall not have even my bones . "
