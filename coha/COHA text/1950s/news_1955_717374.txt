txt New York City is contending that the invoking of the Fifth Amendment to evade questions about official conduct " permits only two possible inferences " ? guilt or perjury . The city 's position has been set forth in a brief by Corporation Counsel Peter Campbell Brown in a case to be argued before the United States Supreme Court in the week of Oct. 17 . The court reconvenes today after its summer recess . Involved is the dismissal of Dr. Harry Slochower , a Brooklyn College associate professor , for refusing to tell a Senate subcommittee on Sept. 24 , 1952 , whether he had been a Communist in 1940 or 1941 . Dr. Sloehower offered to answer questions about later periods , and he said he was not a Communist at the time of the inquiry . The professor 's reinstatement has been urged in a friend-of-thecourt brief by the New . York Civil Liberties Union . The union argued that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in the United States Constitution might be used by the " guiltless , " and should be maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonconformity . At issue is the constitutionality of Section 903 of the City Charter , which went into effect Jan. 1 , 1938 . This section provides automItic dismissal for any city employe refusing to answer authorized questions relating to his official conduct on the ground that his testimony would tend to incriminate him . The city brief was signed by Mr. Brown and four assistants ? Leo A. Larkin , Seymour R. Quel , Daniel T. Scannell and Helen R. Cassidy . Asserting that every ' citizen bad an obligation to testify before lawful tribunals , the statement said : " One of the few permitted exceptions to this general rule is that a person may not be com pelled to give evidence which may tend to implicate hint in al crime . " The invoking of this privilege by an employe of the state in refusing to answer a question which has bearing on his official conduct permits only two possible inferences , either of which disqualify : " ( 1 ) the answering of the question would tend to prove the witness guilty of a crime in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) in order to avoid answering the question propounded , the witness deliberately chose to commit perjury by falsely swearing that the answer would tend to incriminate him . " The brief said the Supreme Court , in Brown vs . Walker in 1896 , had warned a witness that " if he secure legal immunity from prosecution , the possible impairment of his good name is a penalty which it is reasonable he should be compelled to pay for the common good . " Civil Liberties Argument The Civil Liberties brief was signed by Osmond K. Fraenkel , Emanuel Redfield and Nanette Dembitz . It recalled a case in which the Supreme Court set aside last May 23 a contempt conviction of Thomas Quinn , an organizer for the United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers of America ( independent ) . The court , according to the brief , " speaks of those who ' wrongly conceive of it the privilege as merely a shield for the guilty . ' The Civil Liberties statement added : " A person 's refusal may be motivated in part by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid of a prosecution against him though he is in fact guiltless ; or that he will be subjected to unjustified perjury charges on the basis of evidence given the committee by informers if he truthfully denies membership ; or that he will be forced to give information damaging to others though he believes them innocent . " Dr. Slochower is represented by Ephraim London , Leonard P. Simpson , Sherman P. Kimball and Seymour Hunt Chalif . He has contended that the City Charter " abridges " the Fifth Amendment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's ban on state infringements of the privileges or immunities of citizens . He also has charged that the charter provisions for automatic dismissal and ineligibility for future city jobs contravened the " due process " clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The Civil Liberties group appealed for a reversal of Dr. Slochower 's dismissal so an to " erect an important bulwark against the attack impinging from all aides on the privilege aganst self-incrimination . " It argued that the dismissal had been based on suspected associations and beliefs rather than on professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , it feared , would " lead to timid conformity " among teachers who should be " stimulating consideration of the novel and controversial . " The city 's brief argued that the charter sought " to protect the state from disloyal or dishonest employes . " It compared Section 903 with bans on city jobs for crimes , notoriously bad conduct , harmful habits , payment for appointment , dual jobholding , converting public property to personal use and accepting bribes . " The state should be under no greater disability than a private employer in being able to assure itself of loyal and trustworthy employes " the city brief said . It cited " The New York Times , a publication , which has been in the forefront in the defense of civil liberties " as having dismissed an employe after he had invoked the Fifth Amendment &fore; a Senate subcommittee . The Times ' notice of dismissal had informed the employe , Melvin L. Barnet , a copy editor , that " the course of conduct which you have followed since your name was first mentioned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times to lose confidence in you as a member of its news staff .
