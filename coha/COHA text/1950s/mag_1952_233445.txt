As West Germany debated last week whether it should have an army , East Germany was unmasking one . <P> Five thousand jackbooted , blue-uniformed toughs swarmed into the border districts to put down disturbances by farmers trying to save their homes as the Reds bulldozed a three-mile-deep isolation corridor between East and West Germany . The blue-uniformed men , part of a 100,000-man force , are called the People 's Police ( Volkspolizei , or Vopos , for short ) . <P> Escaped East Germans have given West German interrogators a thorough picture of the Vopos . Aside from the occasional guarding of Red army arsenals , they have no police duties , but live in old Wehrmacht barracks and train in the art of war . Out in the field they rehearse platoon and company maneuvers , learn to operate heavy machine guns and the " Stalin Organ " ( a multi-tubed rocket launcher ) . They have a naval arm of 10,000 and a fledgling air force . The Volkspolizei is a police force that walks like an army . <P> The " Sovietniks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( some with as many as 15 different " cover " names ) fire Communism into their minds . For two hours each evening , Vopo graduates of a special Politkultur school in Berlin indoctrinate the men in the history of the Russian Communist Party , the German workers ' movement , the current " peace " campaign . Woe to the Vopo who does not learn his lesson-he may draw up to six weeks ' confinement to barracks . <P> Supervising these activities is a Russian " advisory " staff . Each of the 24 regional Vopo units has its six-man contingent of Red army field-grade officers who dress like Vopos , live in the barracks , and keep a cold eye on training . The other Vopos call them " Sovietniks " and try to stay out of their way . <P> To conceal their true functions , officers and enlisted men have been given police ranks , but each parallels an army rating . The 24 Vopo commands will eventually become 24 full divisions . <P> The Bosses . Boss of the whole show is Security Minister Wilhelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rhineland Red uprisings of 1923 , later turned up in Spain as " General Gomez , " commander of the 13th International Brigade . Heinz Hoffman , Inspector General of the Vopo , is a graduate of the Red army 's war college .
