There was no time for screams , or prayer , or panic . There was just one moment of knowing . I did n't even have timJ to shut my eyes . I know only that I was pushing down hard against the floor boards with my feet , shoving myself back into the soft seat , clawing at the door beside me ? and then , all in the same instant , shooting headlong into solid steel and glass . There was a booming and crashing  --  the most awful sound , t he loudest thing I ever heard . Somewhere in the horror , I remember a whimper . Then there was darkness and silence . What 's it like to crash in suicide seat ' . ' What 's it like to watch your world ending ? First , you 're helpless . You can push yourself an inch or so back into the upholstery , and that 's all . Then , you 're in a catapult . It 's like being shot out of a cannon . That 's suicide seat . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the highways last year . and 1,500,000 injured . I lived through my crash . Maybe you wo n't live through yours . I lived  --  but I 'll wear the scars for the rest of my life . I 'll never ride again without fear . In a way , it 's harder to live . You never think you will be killed . And if you are killed ? well , that 's final . That 's an ending . The people who love you suffer , but your worries are over . If you live through the crash , it 's hard . It hurts for a long time . And maybe you 'll never walk again . Perhaps , like me , you 'll look different . Shatterproof glass breaks , you know . It breaks , and it can cut your face to ribbons and break your skull . Listen : This is what it 's like to live through a smashup . It may be this way for you . I hit the windshield , and broke the windshield . But I grabbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body a little , so that my head hit metal , too , and I bounced back into suicide seat . I lay there with my legs pinned primly together by the engine , which was pushed almost to the edge of the seat . My body was at right angles to my legs . I woke and opened my eyes . Now I was one of the injured , the millions of injured . I opened my eyes and heard my husband 's voice . " Mary , Mary , Mary , I 've killed you ! Oh , my God , I 've killed you ! " There was no pain , just a strange , slow languorous feeling . It was a tremendous effort to speak . I heard my voice , but I was quite apart from it . " You did n't kill me . A truck killed me , " this calm , dry little voice said . " How are you ' ? " I did n't wait to hear how Jack was . I slipped away into darkness and silence . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car in a strange , misty red light  --  men with fire extinguishers . The green wall was still there . A voice right outside my window ? an awed voice  --  said , " God , look at her face ! That damned suicide seat ! " That was the first time I heard the expression " suicide seat " ? at about 5:45 P.M. , on May 16 , 1953 . Then I must have moved or made a sound . I probably groaned . A face came into the car  --  a nice , gentle face . A state trooper . I tGLI Outside of Bloom t , the tritely rut directly in hoot of the Feldman . %%idiot ! ' a warnim .. ' ?

They pried the door off the car , and the trooper lifted me into the ambulance , but this I did n't know about . until later . I heard nothing and felt nothing until the ambulance was moving . That was when fear and panic finally came . I opened my eyes and saw the white coat of the ambulance driver . " Where 's my husband ? Where 's my husband ? " I screamed . " I 'm here , darling . Right here . " " What happened ' ? " " We hit a truck , Mary . My leg is broken and your head is cut a little . We 're all right ? all right ? all right . " " I remember .

Blood was looked likea down blotter with rehieadr.edn His n gray sport shirt kedik " Darndest thing I ever saw . How do you suppose I walked on this leg ? I walked to the ambulance on this leg , " Jack was saying to a nurse . " This leg 's smashed . This is really smashed . " " Jack , are you all right ' ? " " I 'm fine . Just a couple of ribs , I think , and my leg . The doctor will be here in a minute . Are you all right ? " And ? they tell me ? we began a conversation . That 's how it often is when you 're in shock . You may carry on a conversation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same words , over and over again . I asked , " Are you all right ' ? " Jack answered , " I 'm tine . Just a couple of ribs and my leg . Are you all right ? " In half a minute we earnestly asked each other the same questions all over again , as though for the first time , and then again , and again . There , in the emergency room of Bloomington 's St. Joseph 's Hospital , Jack said another thing . He held up his hands , turned them over , opened and closed his fists , and repeated like a prayer , " Thank God ! My hands are all right ! " The day we were married , a pretty little girl with hair like corn silk and black button eyes had come into his office with a bouquet of daffodils . We took them to our wedding , because she had said , " I love you . I feel like I could fly ! " A little girl who was well , because Jack 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered that child as he opened and closed his fists . Then the doctors arrived in the emergency room and my white cart was trundled away from Jack . It was time for X rays . The pain was beginning ? the pain that was to last a long time . It came in giant waves that swept over me and pulled me away from consciousness . I tried , to talk , because I always find assurance in words . I talked to the quiet-faced , white-gowned nun who moved me carefully onto the X-ray table . The doctor said , " Careful . Watch it . Slowly now . " I said , " But she 's gentle . It does n't hurt . X-ray tables are hard . This is n't hard . " The rest of that night was a confused blur . The pain rose higher and higher , consciousness slipped away ? to come back and slip away again . Faces and voices appeared in brief scenes that ended quickly . " You have a skull fracture , " someone said . The surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high white cart . I was taken back to surgery and to Jack . I could touch his hand again because our carts were side by aide for It few moments , A voice said , " We 're going to operate on his knee arid his chest . " " I 'm going to be tine , " Jack said . " This wo n't lake long . They 're going to sew up the cuts on your face . " Strong Jack  --  with his chest caved in ! Then there was silence again . It was n't like any silence I had ever felt . I had a sensation of moving away a great distance , and then coming slowly back into the white room . I heard the words , " I do n't think she 's going to make it . " With a physical yank , I pulled myself up and hack from blackness to light . I had only one thought : t he children . Not-going-to-make-it meant nothing in terms of fear just then . You do n't care whether you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're fuzzy-headed with pain . But not-going-tomake-it meant there were two little children back in Quincy , Illinois  --  my children ? who needed help . I had to get word to my mother , to get her to . Johnny and Mary Sue . And Then They 'll Sew Up Your Face I 'VE got to send some telegrams . " I opened my . I. eyes , and I never saw such shocked faces in my life . A nurse blinked . The surgeon smiled and said , " It 's all right , nurse . Write the messages . " The first message went to a next-door neighbor . JACK AND I IN CRASH . JACK BROKEN RIBS , BROKEN LEG . ME SKULL FRACTURE . TELL ADELAIDE the baby sitter NOT TO TELL THE CHILDREN . The second message , to my mother in California , was the same except that it ended : GO TO QUINCY TO THE CHILDREN , PLEASE . And then ? sure that I was making sense  --  a message to a friend in Chicago , with whom we had planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PARTY TONIGHT . WE CRASHED EN ROUTE . AwFULLY SORRY . And to a family in Evanston , with whom we planned to stay the following night , more regrets . These are the things I did in the moments when I pulled myself back to consciousness : I asked about Jack . I whimpered . I complained that my right foot hurt terribly . ( You 'll do things like that . You 'll pick one place that hurts and concentrate on that.i I could n't move my right arm , my pelvis was twisted , my whole torso sprained , my head was broken . I lay on a bloody table with my throat cut and my face sliced like a loaf of bread . And I complained only that my right foot hurt . Nothing else seemed important ? that is , until the surgeons started sewing my face . If you ride in suicide seat , and you crash in suicide seat , the chances are that they 'll he sewing your face too  --  if you live . I do n't know what a man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do if someone was sewing your face ? Put it this way : if you had a skull fracture and were supposed to he dying , but if you could cling to the very edge of consciousness and watch while they put your face back together , what would you do ? And most women know ? they 'd watch . Every stitch . My theory is that my vanity saved me ? that I pulled myself far enough out of the void to stay out of it , because I was vain . It was the only face I had , and I was fond of it . Above me was a bright floodlight , and grouped around it , six mirrors . I could see six faces ? all mine  --  reflected above me . Six half-faces , and ? six times  --  the ice-cream scoop out of my forehead , the slice across my nose , the slashes on my cheek and the place where the right half of my mouth used to be . I could see my right ear , just dangling , and a bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two nurses , all in green  --  exactly the same shade of green as the truck on the highway . There was no anesthesia with a skull fracture . I felt the pricking of the needle and the black thread going in and out , over and  --  over again . " Take lots of stitches . My husband says the scarring is less on the face if you take plenty of stitches . " I know I said this at least once . " Do n't fret ; you 'll get lots of stitches .... Let 's get this ear back nn now . " " Here 's a tooth knocked out of line , doctor . " No , that 's my crooked tooth . " ' ? Your husband is downstairs in his room , sleeping now . He 's all right .... Yes , his heart is all right . " " Sure looks as though these teeth are out of line .... I ca n't understand how you missed a broken jaw . Stop talking . You 're supposed to he unconscious . Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while more . Do n't move your foot . Hold on ; just a few more . Want to get this cut here . Right through the gums ! . . . No. no. nurse , not that needle  --  a smaller one . I want Number Four-0 black thread .... Well , get some , then . Now . Hurry . Now . Hurry ! " " Now ! Hurry ! " I heard that again . This time it was a woman 's voice . I opened my eyes . I was lying flat , with white covers up to my chin . I could sees carved ivory cross on the wall , blurring and splitt ing into two crosses , there on the wall as close as the truck on the highway . I tried to turn my head . but my head didn't. move . It was stiff . The woman 's voice was my mother 's . Her face was there over my bed . " Mary , are you awake ? " " Jack , where 's Jack ? " I heard her through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours , right through that door . His kneecap is broken . They removed part of it .... And his ribs . . . . He just ate his dinner . " " What time is it ? " " It 's five-thirty . It 's May eighteenth . You 've been here two days now . " Two days of blackness . Two days of stillness . And now it was dusk time again ? dusk time , dinnertime , death time on the highway I did n't see Jack for a week , and then , for only a few minutes . A nurse cranked up my bed ? just a little , but high enough so that I could see him through the door connecting our rooms . He was propped up in his hed , his leg in a casts He waved at me and grinned , a big , happy grin . " Hello again . " I got a big smile from a man who knew his knee might never heal , who felt terrible pain as he lifted his arm in greeting . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pulse of 130 ! My head was n't in a cast after all . That stiffness was blood , dry and hard , with bits of glass in it , and screws and sundry other automobile parts . Under some circumstances you reach Far for a joke . You do that when you hurt and do n't want to cry . My joke was to caution the nurses : " Do n't throw those nuts away they belong in my head . " Not very funny  --  not half so funny as the first day they put Jack in a wheel chair and pushed him into my room . He was wearing a hospital robe made of an old white pucker-striped bedspread . It was straight and ended somewhere below his toes . " That 's my duster. " he said . He wore it even after his robe arrived from home . It gave us something to laugh about . It was two weeks before I could turn my head enough to see my face in the dresser mirror . It was pully , pasty , messy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from serum sickness . That 's a thing that goes along with crash injuries sometimes . When you get metal and glass in you , you have to have a tetanus shot , and sometimes there is a violent allergic reaction . For hours , one night , I was completely unreasonable . " I ca n't stand it ! I ca n't stand this ! " I raved . It ached and itched and throbbed enough to drive a stoic wild . But I stood it , because someone finally got through to me . " Allergic ( Continued Ott Page 62 ) ( 12 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST .1 , MMMMM ary 30 , 1954 I CRASHED IN SUICIDE SEAT ( Con from nage l9 ) reaction ? tetanus shot . " All of a sud. den it was funny , because it was nothing . " This is what they mean by adding insult to injury , " I said . A skull fracture , with a concussion , is a fearfully painful thing . Be warned in advance . You lie flat and still , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst . Then a smashing pain hangs your head between two cymbals , and it starts all over again . Think about that when you get careless on the highway or in town . You can crash right in front of your Own house . Everyone has his own reaction to pain and injury and helplessness . I could n't speak easily , but I wanted to hear voices . I could n't read , because I could n't focus , but Jack read thirty-two books in one week . I wept no tears in the hospital ? 1 who weep easily . I was beyond tears . But Jack , the cairnest of men , wept one night . I could hear the deep , sobbing sounds . I worried mostly about Jack 's heart . not his knee , because I did n't understand the grief a leg injury like that could give him for the rest , of his life . I realized that my face  --  or at least the face I was used to ? was gone . But I knew that I 'd have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one personal fear ? for my mind . Would my mind still work with my head bashed in ? One morning I could n't recall the name of Mary Kirsten , the pert little nurse 's aide . For two days I tried to think of her name , and I said nothing . Finally my surgeon said , " You might as well tell me . What 's eating you ? " " Nothing . " " Come on . I 've got lots of time . Is it your husband ? I 've told you the truth . He 'll be all right .... No ? What , then ' ? " " It 's my mind . Something 's wrong with my mind . I 've lost , a name  --  the nurse 's aide  --  ca n't remember it . " The doctor laughed . He went into Jack 's room , and they both laughed . " I went up to Lincoln today to operate , " the doctor said . " Nurse up there asked me for a prescription . Known her for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could n't think of it . Oh , she was furious . There 's nothing wrong with your mind , but , you 've sure got a lovely skull fracture . " Well , when there 's nothing wrong with your mind , you can think , and wonder . You think a lot when there 's nothing to do but lie still . I started thinking one morning when a lean . hard-faced scrubwoman came into my room , No. 208 . She pushed her mop around with irritating fervor , bumped my bed so hard I wanted to scream . Any joggling hurt . " You look like you been in a wreck , " she said . I was almost rude , but it hurt too much to do anything except mumble , " Yes . " " My Bon-in-law , too , " she said . " He was in a wreck . " " I 'm sorry . " " No , I 'm the one that 's sorry . He was just going to work , not bothering nobody , and a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Was it had ' ? " " It was bad . He turned over four times , and he was killed . Crowded him right off the highway , that car did , and my daughter expecting too . " She went back to her mopping , silent , resentful , leaving me to think . That was the first day I got to see a newspaper . A nurse held it up for me so I could see the headlines . I could n't read the newsprint . But on the front page of the Bloomington Pantagraph that day I counted six people dead in automobile crashes . Six dead and fifteen injured . Six dead ? and the scrubwoman 's son-in-law too . Well , they were dead , and I was alive  --  but I wondered if it was n't more difficult to survive . A wreck is n't over when the ambulance leaves the scene carrying the dead to the morgue and the survivors to the hospital . Being a survivor is a struggle  --  a struggle that lasts a long time . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my children became almost unbearable . I could n't speak t heir names . Finally , the doctors agreed that we might go back to a Quincy hospital , where Johnny and Mary Sue could visit . " We 'll knock you out , and you 'll probably still have a head when you get there , " our surgeon said . The day we left Bloomington , Jack was wheeled into police court to testify against the driver of the big green truck . The driver had been arrested for traffic violations , been released on hail and called hack now for trial . He was young  --  twenty-seven  --  and scared . The state trooper testified . " I was there inside of minutes , and the driver was standing by his truck . I asked him how it happened , and he says , ' I was watching my rear . I did n't look to the right . ' " That 's where we had been  --  on his right . The driver was convicted on a charge of reckless driving . ( His appeal on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they cleared the courtroom . " I just want you to know , " Jack said , " we know you did n't do what you did deliberately . " " I 'd give anything to undo it . I 'm sorry . " But these things are irrevocable . A wrong turn , an extra burst of speed , the carelessness that kills ? these things are irrevocable . All the " sorry " in the world wo n't end your pain , once you crash . And sorrow wo n't silence the screams of the survivore when you make a mistake on the highway . I lay in the ambulance in front of the police station , watching the clear blue summer sky . Trees and sky again ! I Was so happy , waiting for Jack and feeling the hot sun on me , when the state trooper Caine out and over to the ambulance . ? " You do n't remember me , but I know all about you , " he said . " I 'm Joe Griffin . I was there when you crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you stop it ? " He was a good man to silt . He patrols a section of highway in McLean County where twenty-one people died in one year . " I do n't know , " he said . " I had a rough one last week . A young man , only twenty-nine , with a big promotion from his company  --  insurance company . He was driving from Texas to the East to go in the main office . They said he was like a genius . He was killed about a mile from where you crashed . No need for it . " I do n't know why it never occurred to me how much a state trooper cares . This man stood outside the ambulance with the pain etched deep in his leathery face . " He lived a couple of days , but the does said his mind would have been gone . I guess it was better for him that be went . A lot of them do n't go . They live  --  just barely ? for a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeding , and they go right on speeding . They get mad at us . We put up signs and we put on campaigns . We line them and we scare them , and they go right on . " You can get killed just being rude on the highway , he said . That 's a big death reason . You ca n't push people around in automobiles without risk . Speeding is a death reason . And so is relaxing too much when you drive  --  you might forget to look to your right at the crossroads . Drinking and fatigue are death reasons , and stupidity ? the only really incurable driving illness . " Suicide seat 's the worst place in a crash , " the trooper said . " They 're always messed up in suicide seat . " You can wear safety belts in a car  --  webbed belts , much like those you wear in a plane . Now they tell me ! You can buckle on a piece of webbing , so you wo n't smash into the windshield when you crash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? before I crashed . Maybe the California police laughed at that idea once , too  --  but all the highway-patrol cars in California are being equipped with safety belts now . Indiana and Oregon and Washington are putting safety belts in their patrol cars . " I 'd never let mykids ride in the iron t seat of my car , " the surgeon had said . But what if you obey all the rules ? I wanted to know . And if you have n't got a safety belt ? What if you crash then ? Is there anything you can do ' ? How about the witty friend who came to the hospital and said , " You did n't crash right . You should have relaxed . " How do you relax with split seconds between you and sudden death ' ? Relaxing is not the trick , the trooper said . I 've checked this a hundred times since , with a hundred safety officials . ) It 's this way : If you are at the wheel of your car , and you see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leave your foot on the brake , but slide out from under that wheel and throw yourself flat on the front seat . And if you 're riding in suicide seat , do n't brace yourself , whatever you do . Just slide down to the floor , fiat . Cover your head with your arms . Or throw yourself onto the seat , too , if there 's room . Do n't remain in a sitting position . You 've got a chance ? if you 're below the level of the dashboard . If you ca n't get below the dashboard , you 're better off pressed against it than straining away from it . Those in the back seat have the odds in their favor when a crash comes . For best protection there , throw yourself fiat on the floor and hug the back of the front seat . This I know . Now I know ! We 'll be all right . We spent three months in the hospitals . We still hurt . We will for a long time . Jack 's leg is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll probably need an operation someday for the removal of the patella , the rest . of his kneecap .

My ankle will always be one of those floppy , trick things . It 's strapping and health shoes from now on . The head pains will come and go for a year or two . But someday I 'll really romp with my children again . For us , life . But what about you ? You who may crash tomorrow ' ? I keep on wondering , why ? Why ca n't everyone see that a car can he a lethal thing , the pain so great and death so quick ' ? What causes the acci-dents ' ? Is it the bad roads ? No . Three out of four accidents last year involved cars traveling in clear weather on dry roads . Is it dangerous curves that cause crashes ' ? Eighty per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Can it be that our automobiles are n't in good condition ' ? Well , last year nine out of ten cars that crashed were apparently in ' good shape before the smashup . Is it women drivers more than men who cause the accidents ' ? Women were driving in only 8 per cent of the fatal accidents , and 12 per cent of all accidents ; although , of course , there are more men driving , and doing heavy driving . No , those are n't the reasons . There are three major causes for accidents , and they all add up to the same thing : A lack of a sense of responsibility on the part of the American driver . Speed is the worst offense . Thirty-five per cent of all the accidents , and 28 per cent of the fatal accidents last year happened because people drove faster than they should . In open country , failure to keep to the right of that white line was the second worst offense . In cities , the second offense was right-of-way violations . Read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Are n't we grown-up enough to sit behind the wheel of a car ' ? Ca n't we understand what lethal things these powerful . sleek machines can he ? I wondered , as we rolled away from Bloomington and the ambulance nosed around a car smashed up at the edge of the highway . I wondered in the dusk as we pulled up beside another ambulance at the entrance of St. Mary 's Hospital , in Quincy . The orderly and a policeman were gently lifting out a stretcher , careful not to jostle the woman lying on it so still . Our driver jerked his head questioningly , and the policeman answered , " Crash . Out on the hardtop . " My little cart was rolled into the hospital . I could see the other stretcher disappearing down the long , dim corridor . It was dusk time , dinnertime . And I wondered .
