One morning last week Venezuela 's Communist Party boss . Gustavo Machado , walked into the Caracas house of Rear Admiral Wolfgang Larrazabal , leading presidential candidate and ( until he started campaigning ) head of the ruling junta . Half an hour later , smiling from ear to ear . Machado came out with a document . On it was Larrazbal 's signature , officially accepting the support of the Communist Party in the Dec. 7 election . <P> The Reds could have voted for Larrazbal on the yellow ballot of the leftist U.R.D. ( Democratic Republican Union ) Party , which also nominated him . But the Communists , who believe they will make an impressive showing in Venezuela 's first free election since 1947 , wanted their followers to vote on the party 's own red-colored ballots so that Communist strength could be plainly exhibited . By granting his consent . Larrazaal stands to gain an estimated 150,000 Red votes , which could be decisive if the three-way election is a close contest . Others in the race : Rmulo Betancourt. of the leftist Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party . <P> In welcoming the Communists , the handsome naval officer , hero of the revolt that toppled Dictator Marcos Prez Jimnez , has entered into a formal alliance no Latin politico has tried since the days of Guatemala 's hapless Jacobo Arbenz . In taking Red help , Larrazbal insisted that he is not one of them . " I am not a Communist , " he wrote in his acceptance letter . " On the contrary , I am a Catholic of unbreakable faith and a liberal democrat . My acceptance of Communist support does not signify any commitment , present or future . " But by running up a big vote , the Reds hope that 1 ) lesser Communist candidates will ride into office on the red ballot , 2 ) Larrazbal will take Communists into his government . 3 ) he will be forever in their debt . <P> At the hustings popular Candidate Larrazbal was drawing bigger , more enthusiastic crowds than either of his rivals . At a Caracas rally , 100,000 citizens turned out - the most in Venezuelan history . At Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larrazbal could not make a scheduled speech .
