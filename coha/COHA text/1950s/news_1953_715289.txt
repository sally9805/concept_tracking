txt President Eisenhower and a delegation of Congressional leaders , Governors and Federal officials proposed today a sweeping study of Federalstate programs with the aim of decentralizing Federal power and reducing and eliminating costly programs and duplicating taxation . A tripartite commission would make the survey , with the Federal Social Security System as a primary target . Health , welfare , education and road-building programs were mentioned as samples of other targets by Senator Robert A , Taft of Ohio , the Senate Majority Leader . The conferees met with the President from 10 A. M. through lunch and up to the moment that General Eisenhower left the White , House around 1:45 P. M. for his golfing holiday in Augusta , Ga . The Governors said that since ' state budgets were generally in better shape than the national budget , they had offered to contribute $50,000 as well as staff members to get the commission started . Billions of Dollars Involved A bill , which is being drafted in the White House , will be introduced in Congress soon to create the commission  --  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission .. , . oAR , bout twenty-five members that include Presidential , congtetSional and gubernatorial representatives . What the conference tackled was obviously an immense problem involving billions of dollars of Federal and state funds used to administer mutual programs , a great many of them founded by the New and Fair Deal Administrations . Some of the conferees conceded privately that many of these programs were here to stay . They saw , however , a prospect of at least achieving substantial economies by ending Federal participation , in some programs . Such a result not only would cut operational costs but also would save the cost of a bureaucratic unit in Washington that allocates the money used by the counterpart bureau at the state level . By way of illustrating the difficulties of the problem , Senator Taft referred to the school lunch program . He told the conferees that it was something the Federal Government should never have got into , but now the program had become a " terrible thing " that Congress feared to touch . Senator Taft did not propose to end Federal participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of how difficult it was for the Government to disengage itself once it started a program . A White House announcement after the conference said that the President envisaged a commission of bipartisan membership that would propose legislation " to eliminate hodge-podge duplication and waste in existing Federal-state relations affecting governmental functions and taxation . " The President himself issued a statement saying : " Another phase of this problem relates to taxation . The existing systems of taxation , both at the Federal and state level , contain many gross inequalities in so far as the tax burden between citizens of different states is concerned . There is often a pyramiding of taxation , state taxes being super. , used upon Federal taxes in the same field . " The development of the Federal Social Security System warrants study . This analysis should encompass not only the distribution of costs between the state and Federal Government , but also the operation and coverage of the system itself . " It is a proper function , of Government to help build a sturdy floor over the pit of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , we are equally committed to carrying out that great program efficiently and with greatest benefit to those whom it is designed to help . " Gov . Alfred E. Driscoll of New Jersey said that the Governors were aware of the need to balance the Federal as well as the states ' budgets , and that " the Governors were anxious to cooperate with the Federal Government in reducing its cost . " The other Governors present were Allan Shivers of Texas , president of the Governors Conference , which is the executive body of the Council of State Governments ; James F. Byrnes of South Carolina , and Walter J ; Kohler Jr . of Wisconsin . The Council of State Governments is supported by the fortyeight states and in 1949 produced an exhaustive report on the problem taken up today . Entitled " Federal-State Relations , " the document was submitted to the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch Of the Government , which was headed by former President Herbert Hoover , and was printed as a Senate document . Some statistics on duplicating fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Treasury Department reported last year that - the Federal Government collected $45,016,000,000 in taxes from these sources : Individuals and corporations , inheritance and gift levies , alcoholic beverages , tobacco , gasoline , stock transfer , amusements and miscellaneous . State governments tapped those same sources  --  also general sales and property taxes not available to the Federal Government  --  to the tune of $8,932,000,000. gubdivisions of the states covered all the sources of the ? Federal and state governments for a total of $7,998,000,000 . In its report , the council included a paper by Roswell Magill , New York tax expert and former Under Secretary of the Treasury , which showed that if the National Government and the states relinquished certain taxes in duplicating fields , they would come out nearly even in the end and would save the taxpayers money , annoyance in filling forms and administrative costs . Using official revenue sources in the 1948 fiscal year , Mr. Magill proposed that the Federal Government relinquish to the states rev , enues aggregating $2,587,000,000 from these sources : estate and gift taxes , $888,000,000 ; gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : admissions and club dues , $464,000,000 , and Federal unemployment tax , $205,000 , - 000 . On the other hand ; the states would stop taxing two sources and give up two Federal aid items , which brought them $2,351,000,000 in the 1948 fiscal year . These were state income taxes , $1,079,000,000 ; liquor and tobacco , $769,000,000 ; Federal highway aid , $436,000,000 , and administrative grants under Federal unemployment tax , 07 , - 000,000.
