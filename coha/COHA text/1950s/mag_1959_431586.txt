The girls met in a Greek class at Hunter College , and for old times ' sake they decided to record their teacher , Professor Emeritus Pearl C. Wilson , reading poetry and prose in ancient Greek .

The most important development in the past ten years , however , has been the impressive demand for the best music in the world played by the most talented musicians . " The development of the long-playing high-fidelity record has had much the same relationship to the spread of classical music that the invention of printing had to literature , " according to Dean Earl V.

Most of this Renaissance music , written in archaic notes with little hint of what voices and instruments Gabrieli had used , had not been heard for centuries . Vanguard hired scholardetectives to find out what instruments should record the music , and to transcribe the ancient notation into a modern score . The result , after years of search and study , was one of the best-received recordings of the year . Many a composer has been rescued from almost complete oblivion .
