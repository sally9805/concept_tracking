For two years the Rev. Georges Bissonnette of Central Falls , R.I. has shepherded a strange little flock in a dangerous wilderness . Under the terms of the 1933 Roosevelt-Litvinoff agreement by which the U.S. recognized the Soviet Union , U.S. denominations were permitted to send clergymen to minister to their nationals in Moscow . The Augustinians of the Assumption were chosen to supply priests to the Roman Catholics , and Father Bissonnette was the fourth Assump-tionist to serve a tour of duty in the enemy 's citadel ( no Protestant groups have ever sent ministers ) . <P> French-speaking Father Bissonnette , 33 , has been a lively and well-liked figure in Moscow 's tiny free world .

The sudden expulsion was obviously an act of retaliation for U.S. refusal to extend the visitor 's visa of Metropolitan Boris , Exarch of the Russian Orthodox Church of North America , who left Manhattan last week after his prescribed stay of 60 days . <P> The U.S. at once " protested vigorously " through Ambassador Charles E. ( " Chip " ) Bohlen that Father Bissonnette 's expulsion was a violation of the 1933 agreement and was " in no way related to cases of temporary visits " like that of Metropolitan Boris . In Moscow Father Bissonnette sadly said a last Mass in his apartment for 20-odd members of his flock . He advised them to turn for spiritual guidance to the Russian priest of the Church of St. Louis , Moscow 's only Roman Catholic Church . Said Father Bissonnette : " If you do not speak Russian or Polish and have trouble with the language , just say ' Ya vinovat ' ( I am guilty ) , and he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
