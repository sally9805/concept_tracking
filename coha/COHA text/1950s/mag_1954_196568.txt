The first drama of the new session of Congress took place last week , five hours after the President had delivered his State of the Union message , and after most Senators and Congressmen had pronounced their appraisals to newsmen and gone home to dinner . Just after dark , Ohio 's white-haired Republican Senator John W. Bricker walked into the White House and made his way to Ike 's second-floor study to meet with the President and an assortment of Administration brass , including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , Attorney General Herbert Brownell and Senate Majority Leader Bill Knowland . The problem : what to do about the Bricker amendment ( TIME , July 13 ) , which has turned into a time-bomb threat to both G.O.P. unity and White House-congressional relations . <P> The Administration opposed the Bricker amendment at hearings last spring , but between sessions , John Bricker and his disciples carried their case through the nation . Bricker returned to Congress last week with not only the backing of his powerful old ally , the American Bar Association , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . The plain fact confronting the conference in Ike 's study : John Bricker had assembled enough Republican and Democratic votes to get his amendment through the Congress , and enough support in enough states to get the amendment into the Constitution . <P> Sticking Points . Brownell , Dulles , Knowland &; Co. worked hard to get a compromise with the Bricker forces , but inevitably , both sides ran into two basic sticking points : <P> No. 1 . Bricker insists that Congress shall have the power to regulate all executive agreements ; the Administration will not yield these powers-which are all too slender in an era when events demand fast , detailed executive action in foreign relations . <P> No. 2 . The amendment specifies that no treaty shall become the law of the land until both houses of Congress have passed enabling legislation . Bricker wants Congress to determine which treaties require enabling legislation ; the Administration insists that the President must have the power to decide . <P> Dedicated Man . John Bricker 's mood is one of dauntless dedication . He is willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suits his conscience . But he complains that the Administration does not really know its own mind . " It 's my Administration , " he says . " It 's a Republican Administration . I want to get along with them . But they do n't seem to want to understand the issue . They have n't advanced one cogent argument against the principles of the resolution . " <P> Bill Knowland is duty bound to call up the Bricker amendment for action in the Senate in the first weeks of the session . If no compromise can be reached with Bricker by then , the Administration has two fearsome choices : 1 ) tight-lipped acceptance of defeat , and all that it may mean in crippling the operation of U.S. foreign affairs ; 2 ) a wide-open fight between wings of the Republican Party , with subsequent peril to the Administration 's legislative program . <P> Said Vice President Nixon at week 's end : " All of the Republicans are virtually on their knees praying , but it 'll take a miracle to bring this thing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
