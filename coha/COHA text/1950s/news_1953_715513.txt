txt President Eisenhower expounded today his concept of balanced economic and military security . It was based on a realistic air power program , a rejection of isolationism and complete devotion to Allied unity within the United Nations . The President addressed the annual convention of the National Junior Chamber of Commerce this afternoon , on the first day of a five-day trip in which he will explain his Administration 's programs to the people . With firmness but without acerbity , General Eisenhower struck again at the views recently expressed by Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio , Senate majority leader , suggesting that the United States ignore the United Nations in its Far East policies . Similarly he answered the critics of his air power program , promising more planes in fact , fewer in theory , as the warm debate continued over the Administration 's proposed slash of $5,000 , - 000,000 in the Air Force budget . Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg , Chief of Staff of the Air Force , has contended that the proposed reduction would give the country a one-shot Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loom The President 's speech was a more carefully premeditaled and reasoned expression of the views he had been expressing in news conferences and in his recent nation-wide radio and television broadcasts . He tackled the vital issues of national security and world peace at a time when support from the groups he meets on this trip might influence the related tests approaching in Congress on taxes , I the defense budget , foreign trade and foreign aid . When the President entered the Municipal Auditorium he was greeted with an uproar of cheering and noise-making from the more than 8,000 young men and women who were delegates to the convention . He grinned appreciatively and raised his hands as the great hail shook with cheers and the vibrations of all manner of noise-makers . Soon after his arrival here the President began to pick up sentiment , from business men as well as politicians . He stopped at the American Swedish Institute , a cultural organization , for a reception by a group of about fifty persons , including Gov . C. Elmer Anderson , who had greeted him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board of directors of Pillsbury Mills , brought up the controversial excess profits tax . He said the great majority of big and little business men in Minneapolis " were absolutely back of you . " Mr. Pillsbury said the business men here were not going along with the National Association of Manufacturers , which has opposed before a Congressional committee the six-month extension of the fix that the President desires in order to raise an additional $800,000,000 of revenue . " Our defeat on that was 84 to // 46 in our favor , " President Eisenhower replied . " That is a kind of defeat that I can take . " The reference by the President was to a vote taken by an official group of the National Association of Manufacturers . While the vote was 84 to 46 to continue the tax , it actually was a vote that continued the association 's opposition . That was because the 84 votes in favor did not constitute two-thirds of the voting group . The excess profits tax is to expire June 30 . The extension faces strong opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives . Then another questioner wanted to know what the Administration would do in case of a recession . " From the beginning , " said the President , " we 've had people who were experts studying every single indication on the horizon in order to be ready to take timely Governmental action , no matter whether the forces are deflationary or inflationary cycles . " President Eisenhower In his speech viewed the world crisis as total and universal , a struggle being waged against communism not for imperialistic or materialistic objectives but essentially " for the soul of man himself . " He rejected any idea , however , that the fight could be made successfully with guns alone , or by refuge in what " we might call the ' fortress ' theory of defense " according to which the United States would follow a lone course . Demands Complete Unity The President did not mention Senator Taft or General Vandenberg but it was plain that he had their views in mind . Nor did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , rejecting the kind of truce that is in the making in the Korean war . The South Korean Republic seemed to be specially intended for notice , however , as he pleaded that all free nations should stand together and that " no free nation is too humble to be forgotten . " " There is no such thing as partial unity , " said the President in his discussion of what unity and isolation would mean in the world of today . " That is a contradiction in terms . " In his recent Cincinnati speech , Senator Taft had said that if the truce negotiations broke down in Korea , the United States should ignore the United Nations and decide what to do by itself . Clarify . ing his views during a flurry of adverse reactions , Senator Taft said that the United Nations had been effective in stopping aggres-1 sion but not in the over-all task of achieving world peace . In discussing the defense pro-1 gram , President Eisenhower re iterated that even with the $5,000 , - 00.0,000 slash , the country would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some form of air , power . To emphasize what air power in the developing atomic era meant , he explained that twenty-five aircraft with modern weapons could " in a single attack visit on an enemy as much explosive violence as was hurled against Germany by our entire air effort throughout four years of World War IL " He seemed to be referring specifically to General Vandenberg , who deplored before a Congressional committee a few days ago the Administration 's reduction of the original plan for 143 wings by mid-1954 . A wing is the basic operating unit of the Air Force , and contains from thirty to seventy-five planes , depending on the type of plane and the mission .
