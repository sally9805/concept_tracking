The man who blueprinted the Welfare State , 72-year-old Lord Beveridge , last week surveyed the brave new world of womb-to-tomb security and sadly reported : there has been " too much leveling down . " <P> Addressing himself to " My dear Posterity " in a talk over Britain 's BBC , Beveridge complained : " The baronial hall with its troops of servants laying coal fires in every room is giving place to rows of council houses each with radiators and a television aerial ... It is not possible for anyone , however hard and well he works , to enjoy the kind of income or to make the savings for old age that were easy when I was a young man . " <P> What worried His Lordship most was how to find the " right natural leaders " in what he called an " economically flattened " society . " In the old days , " he said , " when individual wealth could pass on to one 's children , much of the leadership of the country was determined automatically . Just from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leadership will come ... I do not know . <P> " Somehow , " sighed Lord Beveridge ( himself the son of an untitled Indian civil servant ) , " we have to carry on the aristocratic tradition ... without the aristocrats . "
