Spinning around the great circuits of the world , one whining , bright red racer topped them all last year : Italy 's Maserati , the car that whisked Juan Manuel Fangio to a world championship and many another driver to fame in the last 30 years . To Maserati 's makers , Adolfo Orsi and his son Omar , the fame was expected to pave the way for quantity production of a new richly appointed sports-touring car rivaling Mercedes-Benz and Ferrari . When tighter new rules outmoded their biggest racers last fall , the Orsis were ready to quit racing and plunge completely into the luxury market with an $11,000 Maserati Gran Turismo 3500 ( 143 m.p.h . ) . <P> Last week Maserati skidded off the track . The government-owned bank Credito Italiano asked that Adolfo Orsi be declared bankrupt , impounded Maserati 's assets , sent the shamed Orsis into hiding . Adolfo owed the bank $15,600 and had written a check with no funds to cover it . But that was only part of the reason . For the Orsis , the bright fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands from a blessing into a curse . <P> In 1937 Adolfo bought the Alfieri Maserati firm , then financially foundering , as an addition to his scrap-iron and farm-implement businesses , later used the plant as the base of a new machine-tool business . Racing cars were only the frosting on the cake to give the tools a famous name . By last year the combination was bringing in $3,000,000 annually . But along with the cash came trouble . <P> Argentine Dictator Juan Peron , a racing bug and sponsor of Driver Fangio , got so enthusiastic about Maserati racers in 1954 that he handed Adolfo Orsi a $3,000,000 machine-tool order to help speed Argentine industrialization . In turn , Adolfo enthusiastically allowed Peron three years to pay . A year later , when Peron was ousted , Argentina had paid only a fraction of its bill , all in wheat to the Italian government , which has yet to convert it into cash for Maserati . To top it off , Adolfo took on another $437,500 machine-tool order from the Spanish government-which has also failed to pay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To save Maserati without wrecking their remaining businesses , which are independently solvent ( annual sales : $2,000,000 ) , the Orsis offered Driver Fangio a 50% share in Maserati for $625,000 . Fangio , who has a thriving G.M. distributorship in Buenos Aires , could raise only half the necessary funds . That left Maserati at the mercy of the state-owned Credito Italiano , which had the right to turn the firm over to the government . Last week the plant was still running-but for the government and without the Orsis.
