South Africa 's Jim Crow laws discriminate against the country 's 300,000 East Indians as well as its 8,000,000 Negroes . India has found a simple way to retaliate . It simply clamped an embargo on all exports to South Africa , including jute bags , in which India has a near world monopoly . South Africa uses 15,000 tons of bags every year for packaging its crops . Negroes and poor whites use them as beds , blankets , carpets and doormats . Now old bags are being patched like tire tubes . A farmer who clothed his Negro laborers in jute , with holes cut for head , arms and legs , was fined not for underpaying and ill-treating his help , but for destroying bags . In desperation , the Malan government went to the black market . <P> The government has paid more than $25 million this year to buy gunny sacks in Europe , then handed them out at a loss to South African farmers , who must return them for reuse . Last week came the unkindest blow of all . Shamefacedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one European black-marketeer , working through a Swiss bank and with a forged Lloyd 's certificate that his bags had been inspected and approved , loaded a million bags aboard a British freighter at Genoa . When the bales were unwrapped at Durban , they proved to be full of rags . The swindler , admitted Minister Louw , got away with $700,000 of the government 's money .
