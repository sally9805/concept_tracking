The New York Times Sunday Magazine section carried a glowing analysis called " The ' New Look ' of the President . " In London , Lord Beaverbrook 's Daily Express took up the cry : " Call him a new Ike . For there 's no doubt about it . Dwight D. Eisenhower is a changed man today . " To the studious newspaper reader and radio listener , it seemed that everybody and everybody 's brother , aunt , cousin and cook were prattling happily about the New Eisenhower . It was an odd business because , in point of obvious fact , the New Eisenhower had been around for quite a while-and his presence was apparent over months past to anyone willing to look . <P> Sudden Flood . What had brought the tide of praise for President Eisenhower to sudden flood was apparently enthusiasm for his bold effort to sweep aside the cold war 's barriers by trading visits with Soviet Premier Khrushchev . The chatter about the New Eisenhower came during an Ike week that was dramatic in several other ways . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference , held in a converted Gettysburg gymnasium . On Capitol Hill , an attempt to override an Eisenhower veto of an inflated housing bill failed miserably and all but nailed down a victory for Ike in his long , steady fight to balance the U.S. budget .

He is now the man of action again , moving and planning and speaking out with a new serenity . " Pundit Walter Lippman , who had been wringing his hands for years about Eisenhower shortcomings , agreed-more or less-with Reston : " We have seen no such display of energy and initiative since the early days of his first Administration . For years the present Eisenhower has been quiescent , as it were submerged . But what we see now is not a new Eisenhower . This is the old authentic Eisenhower with his liking for large gestures which sweep aside the concrete details that more worldly statesmen and professional diplomats worry about . " <P> Full Holler . Characteristically , the British press , until a few weeks ago reviling Ike as a senescent , bewildered man ( " a man who can hardly perform his day-to-day tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now turned full-holler the other way round . Under the headline ,
