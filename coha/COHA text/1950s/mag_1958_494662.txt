Defending the Court NO ONE suppose that because , during the closing minutes of the last session of Congress , legislation to curb the authority of the , Supreme Court failed to pass , the campaign against the Court is dead or has lost its momentum . For the past three years , the Court has been exposed to concerted and vicious attacks . Charges of insanity , depravity , Communism , treason have become commonplace . The leadership of this campaign has come , in large part , from the South . But it has gone North looking for recruits , and it has found them . The immediate aim of the Southerners may be to undermine the Court 's school desegregation order , but the target is broader than that : it is civil liberties in general . Rep. Howard W. Smith ( D , Va . ) will reintroduce next month HR 3 ( it lost in the Senate last time by one vote ) , a bill to repeal the long-standing doctrine of federal preemption in the fields of concurrent federal-state jurisdiction . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern conservative , is only one of many who have been saying that we must get rid of the notion " that the Supreme Court must legislate . " ( In 1937 , FDR said much the same thing : we must have a " government of laws , not men . " ) The reaction to this campaign on the part of responsible leaders of opinion has not been quite what one might have hoped . On the one hand , aid and comfort has come to the Know-Nothings from some very surprising quarters . Thus the Chief Justices of the State Supreme Courts saw fit this past summer to issue ( over dissents in their own ranks to be sure ) an almost wholly unsupported broadside , criticizing the Court in vague , general terms . On the other hand , the Court has been afforded the doubtful benefit of a kind of wholesale , indiscriminate defense : Whatever the Court lays down ( and however the Court lays it down ) is right , because the Court speaks in the name of the Constitution . Its doctrines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fit subject for comment . This is more or less the President 's position . Such a defense strengthens the Court 's enemies , who are able to point out that the American tradition rather indicates that the Court 's pronouncements and ways of doing business are as much legitimate subjects for public debate as any other question of state , and that the Court 's doctrines will command broad and enduring support only as they seem worthy of support . Moreover , such wholesale defense , tending to foreclose discussion , weakens the Court itself . Here , after all , are nine men insulated from all political responsibility , receiving each day in their marble temple the natural deference of their own entourage and of the lawyers who stand before ? and below ? them , prevented by custom from discussing their affairs with anyone but their colleagues and law clerks . How if not through the play of outside criticism can a sense of contact with , and responsibility to , present opinion be injected to balance and reinforce a Justice 's sense of responsibility to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him and to the tasks that will face those who sit when he is gone ? Happily , a wholly different note is struck in two distinguished recent addresses , one to the California Bar by Erwin N. Griswold , Dean of the Harvard Law School , the other at Brandeis University by Paul A. Freund , Carl M. Loeb University Professor at Harvard . Both denounce in the strongest terms " the ignorant and disgraceful billingsgate , " as Mr. Freund calls it , to which the Court has been subjected . Leaders of opinion have a duty to condemn defiance of Court decrees ; moreover , beyond this , certainly in the desegregation cases , the Court 's decisions must be defended on their merits , as right and good . One aspect of such a defense on the merits is , one might almost say , factual-scientific . Its point is provable . For what is in question is the process of the Court , whether it has abided by the usages of the craft in its treatment of precedent , of jurisdictional and procedural problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rather different . Particularly in the desegregation cases , it touches more nearly ultimate morality and truth . Here , nevertheless , as Dwight MacDonald has said with relation to esthetic issues , agreement is possible , since while the point " can not be proved , it can be demonstrated , a quite different operation involving an appeal ? by reason , analysis , illustration and rhetoric ? to cultural values which critic and reader have in common . " Neither Dean Griswold nor Mr. Freund , however , is content to rest with a defense of the Court . And so they both proceed to a vigorous if judicious criticism of other features of the Court 's work . A number of recent majority opinions and a somewhat greater number of dissenting opinions have shown a disturbing tendency , in Mr. Freund 's words , " to carry a sound principle beyond the point where it collides with a sound principle rubbing against it from the other direction " ? to the point , that is , where judicial error is demonstrable . Thus , to take one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealing to shared values , can lead one to see that a state ought not to be allowed to exclude from its bar an applicant who , though once a Communist , . fs able to show that he has long since had a change of heart and is now attached to the Constitution . There is nothing wrong , indeed everything right , about the Court 's so holding ? as it has . But it is another thing entirely to tell a state , as the Court did in Konigsberg v. California last year , that an applicant who , though he was pleased to assert his own good character and loyalty , refused to answer questions regarding Communist affiliations , must also be admitted to the Bar as a person of good moral character . After all , it is only common sense to consider that such questions offer a good test of the applicant 's general veracity . And the Court is not prepared to hold ? and it obviously could not very well hold ? that good moral character is an improper standard for Bar admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , or that Communist affiliation is irrelevant to that . The sound principle of state self-government , rubbing from the other direction , was reached here , and should have prevailed . For the performance of its great and unique task , we should preserve , protect and defend the Court ? when necessary , by criticizing its missteps . Budget Realities T HE Bureau of the Budget now estimates that the national deficit which was $3 billion last year will have grown to $12 billion by the close of business this coming June . Budget Director Maurice Stans sees " little present hope of holding expenditures in fiscal 1959 much below $80 billion " ? as against an income of $67 billion . " The hard fact , which many people fail to realize , " Mr. Stans told the Union League Club of New York , is that 77 percent of our current budget is devoted to the cost of past wars and the present Cold War . This year the costs of present national security ( military , atomic energy and Mutual security ) plus past wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $61 billion . If we deduct this from the estimated revenues of $67 billion , we would have only $6 billion left to run the rest of the government .. . At the same time Mr. Stans was stressing the difficulties of cutting expenditures , Rep. Wilbur Mills , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , was proposing a thorough reorganization of the tax structure . " A great deal of revenue , " he says , " could be provided by a broadening of the tax base , a removal of some special deductions and DECEMBER 15 , 1958 preferences , and an increase in rates on some specially favored groups . " In the last Congress , Democratic leadership agreed with the Administration that to raise the tax question would be to lift the lid on a Pandora 's box . But as the realities of US obligations and needs become more evident during the coming budget debate , that fearful view should no longer be controlling . Who Rules the House ? THE House Rules Committee is the right-wing minor- ity 's secret weapon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the first week of the new Congress , liberal Democrats ? however many there are ? will have surrendered before the battle starts . The man who will rule is the chairman of the Rules Committee ? Howard W. Smith ( D , Va. ) , who scored 90 percent wrong on The NR 's analysis of voting records in the last session . He will run the 12-man Committee , and thereby the House , because he will be able to command six of the 12 Committee votes . Any legislation not to his liking can be denied access to the floor . There are eight Democrats and four Republicans on the Committee as it now stands . But two of the Democrats ? Smith and Colmer of Mississippi ? are at least as reactionary as any Republican . And where in the last session some liberal legislation had the swing support of two Republican Committee members ? Hugh Scott ( Pa. ) and Henry J. Latham ( N.Y . ) ? neither is in the new House . The Republicans who are likely to take their place will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be nullification of legislative progress during the next two years , the Democratic leadership is required to limit the power of Chairman Smith . This can be done , as we pointed out in our post-election issue , only in two ways : either by re-establishing the 21-day rule , permitting any bill to be brought to the floor for debate and vote if it has been before the Rules Committee for as long as 21 days ; or , by enlarging the Rules Committee to at least 15 members , so that an eight-man majority could overrule Chairman Smith . Both reforms are more than desirable , they are essential if this Congress is to do what it was elected to do . Nepotism at the Dime H ATS OFF to Elliott V. Bell , a corporation executive HATS but not an organization man . Mr. Bell , chairman of the executive committee of McGraw-Hill , often sounds off about the economy with views that we may not always agree with , but that are original , forthright and often frankly controversial ? a rarity in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just resigned as trustee of the Dime Savings Bank of Brooklyn , a cushy lifetime sinecure , in protest at the election to the board of a son of the chairman . " The trustees of a mutual savings bank being self-elected , serving for life and having no stockholders to account to , are under an obligation to hold themselves to a very high standard of conduct , " he said . We could question Mr. Bell 's implication that the standard of conduct need be any lower at , say , stockholder-owned A T &; T ? but no matter . What does matter is that the New York State Banking Department says it can not forbid nepotism in the savings banks . It seems wrong for such great aggregates of other people 's money ( $1.2 billion at Dime Savings ) to be controlled by self-perpetuating boards without even a theoretical check by the depositor-owners or the authorities . Perhaps there should be a law . Nobody 's Good Enough WE have been listening for some months to the opinV V ions of amateurs and experts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the Democratic Presidential nominee in 1960 . And we have tentatively decided that the only really good candidates are dead . Among the living , one is too far out in front and another is hardly visible . One talks too much , another too little . Some are too old , some too young . If Mr. Right were to come along , he could not be nominated , and if nominated , he could not be elected . The charming Senator Kennedy has a creditable voting record , intelligent advisers and an assured TV manner . But he needs aging , and why does the South like him , and why did n't he criticize Joe McCarthy ? Senator Symington , then ? a dean-cut figure , a family man , a commendable voting record . But where 's the oomph ? Governor Meyner has green eyes and a great many votes in New Jersey , and his wife is related to Adlai Stevenson . But what does he believe ? There is , of course , Adlai himself . The Gallup Poll says he 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best qualified . But no . He 's putting on weight , he 's had it twice , he 's divorced . So what about Senator Humphrey ? Everybody knows where he stands . If he can out-talk Khrushchev he can out-talk Nixon ; and the people in Minnesota love him . Yet . . . did n't Doris Fleeson call him a " gliberal " ? Then why not pick a political President , a man of experience and parliamentary skill ? Draft Lyndon Johnson . On the other hand , he 's Southern , or almost , and votes with the oil interests . " Soapy " Williams ? He 's in the tradition ? aristocratic but with a heart that beats for the working man . Still . . . he did n't win big enough the sixth time , and there are those bow ties and square dances . Alright for Michigan . . . but . A dark horse then . Joe Clark ? Splendid . Refined . Courageous . But does n't he look a little frail ? And so we hunt for a hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after the election . We have a simple but practical suggestion : let all liberal Democrats immediately cease their search for the best man , and start looking for the second best . Strength or Paralysis ? V ICE PRESIDENT NIXON , responding at a London press conference to allegations of weakness in President Eisenhower 's leadership , is reported by the London Times to have said that the President " might not seem to lead vigorously , but the results spoke for themselves ? for instance , over Quemoy and Matsu . " The example confirms the criticism . What a frozen leadership does is to maintain a firm stand on the position to which it is frozen . Just as it can not advance , so it can not retreat . One of our correspondents , referring to the weakness of recent French governments , pointed out in these pages that France repeatedly " found herself unable to move forward or back , able only to utter protests at the actions of others . " The demonstrations of firmness that the Eisenhower Administration has provided so far have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HERE HAS BEEN a rash of stories about inflation in the arts , brought about , Time magazine believes , by the " buccaneer investor , who does not know what he likes but knows a good investment when he sees one . " This week , a small Picasso of no consequence is on display at the Carnegie International show in Pittsburgh , priced at $60,000 . In the art world , as in the commercial world , it is less important what you are than who you are . Art News sets the fashion ( abstract expressionism ) and the impressionable pay for the privilege of being a la mode . A picture by an Art News favorite , Jackson Pollock , was bought by the Metropolitan Museum of New York within the past month for $30,000 ; several years ago it would have brought $1,000 or less . As The New Republic 's art critic suggested last July , a painting these days " is not so much an object of virtue as the painter is saint . . . . The girl who ends up with Picasso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paintings . " The real collectors , those who buy for love , are forced to consider the cash potential of a canvas that has caught them . Each collector has a list of pictures he could have bought for so much less a short time ago , and some of them are investing over their heads just because they are afraid not to buy now , for fear prices will keep on climbing . Five years ago , one Midwest exhibitor handled an Abraham Rattner that was offered for $1,800 . Last spring , it was priced at $8,000 , and it has been said on some authority that " next year it will be three times that . " DECEMBER 15 , 1958 Anti-Merger Enforcement UNITED STATES District Judge Edward Weinfeld 's re- cent decision , holding the proposed merger between Bethlehem Steel Corporation and the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company would violate the " anti-merger " statute , could well launch a new era in antitrust enforcement , with emphasis on merger prosecutions . This presupposes , of course , that the Department of Justice and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weinfeld 's favorable interpretation of the statute ( which seems likely ) , and that the President will ask Congress for enough money to enable these agencies to do an effective job ( which seems unlikely ) . It is not surprising to learn that a merger of Bethlehem and Youngstown would be in violation of the law . They are among the largest industrial corporations in the United States , ranking approximately 9th and 53rd in sales . Their combined assets are well over $2 billion . In the iron and steel industry , Bethlehem is second largest , Youngstown sixth . In terms of ingot capacity , they represent approximately 20 percent of the entire steel industry . They produce many of the same steel products and have competed actively in a number of markets . Obviously , their merger would be one of the largest in the history of our country . But most mergers do not cast shadows as gargantuan as that of Bethlehem-Youngstown . Generally , the companies are smaller , the industry less important and the affected competition not as significant . The task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they must attempt to apply Judge Weinfeld 's interpretation of the law in Bethlehem-Youngstown to mergers of lesser significance . This , we believe , these agencies will not be reluctant to do ? at least at the career-man level . In the eight years since the present " anti-merger " law was passed , the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission have brought in the neighborhood of 40 cases against mergers . This is a fairly modest number in view of the thousands of mergers occurring in that period , but we can understand this modesty in the absence of a definitive interpretation of the law . Judge Weinfeld has now supplied that definitive interpretation and a certain boldness of approach to the merger problem would now seem to be in order . But this , as the saying goes , " takes money . " We believe the new Congress would give the President whatever he asks for to forestall further undue concentration in industry ? one of the basic objectives of the anti-merger statute . The big question is , will he ask for it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advisory letter to its members entitled : YOUR DEALINGS WITH MEMBERS OF THE NEW CONGRESS . It 's heartbreaking . Businessmen are not appreciated . There is first of all a " tendency in government to look upon business as something to be taxed and regulated . " Few understand that the businessman " is usually hemmed in . . . by employees who look upon the business solely as a source of income for themselves and not a way of life ? , and the more income the better ; by suppliers who want highest prices for their materials cads ; ' by creditors and stockholders who . . . look for security and perhaps larger income ; by consumers who want better products at cheaper prices . " But if the businessman minds his manners , he can survive . " Try , " advises the Chamber , " to avoid giving the appearance that you are ignoring the election returns when you express your opinions to Members of Congress . There is a general impression that the voting trend indicated a lack of support for the Conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , the man who shows a willingness to take another look at his position in the light of possibly changing conditions , is always more convincing . " We 're convinced .
