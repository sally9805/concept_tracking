. He wanted his dinner , which would be served him in a privy chamber with Alice , and he wandered towards the stair . His two elder sons looked at each other , John in response to a gesture walked over to his brother 's couch . " Let him go  --  " whispered the Prince . " He 'll not be needed now . " He fell back on the cushions , gasping . His squire mopped his templeswith spirits of wine and after a moment the Prince spoke again , " Nor am I needed . Christ 's blood , that I should come to this  --  useless , stinking mass of corruption ! John , I must trust you . I know your loyalty  --  whatever they say . Conciliate them  --  listen to them . Hold this kingdom together for my son ! " Tears suddenly spurted down his cheeks and a convulsion shook his body . John knelt by the couch . His own eyes were moist , while he  --  4 silently kissed his brother 's swollen hand . The convulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prince for months . They carried him sadly from the Painted Chamber and took him home by barge to Kennington across the river , where Princess Joan and their little Richard awaited him . Very soon the Commons began to show its mettle . A delegate  --  requested that certain of the lords and bishops might join with them in conference in the chapter house . The Duke agreed graciously and waited with sharp interest to hear their choice , nor was surprised that amongst the twelve men named were two of his bitterest enemies , his nephew-in-law , the Earl of March , and Bishop Courtenay of London . The earl , still at twenty-five pimply and undersized , had never forgiven the slight Lancaster had put upon him after the Duchess Blanche 's death , when he had been kept cooling his heels in the Savoy . Each year his jealousy had grown and was now reinforced by fear . March 's two-year-old son , Roger Mortimer , was heir presumptiveto the English crown , after Richard . Unless the dastardly Lancaster should plot to force the Salic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger 's claim came through his mother . This fear added fresh fuel to March 's loathing ; and the earl , upon hearing his name called , looked up at the Duke with a sly triumphantsneer , which Lancaster received with a shrug . March was a poor weedy runt whose spite was worth no more return than bored contempt . Courtenay was more formidable . As Bishop of London he was 4 s the most powerful prelate in the country after Canterbury , and the Duke 's well-known views on Episcopal wealth and his associationp301with Wyclif had long ago incurred Courtenay 's hatred . The Commons ' choice of these two lords to bolster up their coming attack against the crown gave some measure of the difficultiesahead , but was not startling . The choice and the acceptance of Lord Henry Percy of Northumberland , however , was dismaying . The Duke , standing rigid on the dais , watched with a tight mouth while the twelve hostile bishops and lords filed out to the Abbey chapter house to join the Commons . The lords remaining in the Painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvets and let loose a buzz of consternation . Michael de la Pole detached himself from his fellows and coming up to the Duke said with the familiarity of long friendship , " By God 's blood , Your Grace , what 's got into Percy ? The blackguard 's gone over to the enemy ! Yet a month ago he swore passionate love to you and the King ! " The Duke laughed sharply . " He has no enduring passion except for himself and his wild Border ruffians . He 's swollen with pride and no doubt March has been puffing it with the hot air of prom-ises . " He sighed , and de la Pole looking at him with sympathy said , " There 's a vicious battle ahead , and I do n't envy you the general-ship . " In the ensuing days , the Commons ' line of attack became abundantlyclear . The first mine was sprung with the election of Peter de la Mare as their Speaker . De la Mare was the Earl of March 's steward . He was also a blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chancellor 's demand for a subsidy . What , he asked , had become of all the money already granted ? The people , de la Mare went on , were grievously dismayed at the shocking waste and corruption in high places , and they wished the guilty parties brought to justice . He stopped . There was a long silence in the Painted Chamber . Everyone looked at the Duke , who finally said , inclining his head , " Indeed if this be so , the people are within their rights . Who are those whom you would name , and what are their alleged crimes ? " And he smiled with perfect graciousness . The smaller fry were dealt with first : a customs collector , and the London merchants John Peachey and Richard Lyons , both accused of extortion , monopoly and fraud . These men were summarilytried , found guilty and sent off to prison.  |p302Then  as the Duke and his friends had suspected , the Commons went for Lord Latimer . They accused him of a dozen peculations , of having helped himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally of treason in Brittany . Here John momentarily lost his calm and spoke out in anger , for Latimer , however unattractive a personality , had been his friend , and though quite probably guilty of malversation , the accusation of treason the Duke considered to be outrageous , and said as much . It was thereupon withdrawn , but Latimer was found guilty on the other charges , and the Duke , biting his lips and avoiding the convictedpeer 's frightened foxy eyes , made no further effort to save him . The Commons exulted openly : they had for the first time in history succeeded in impeaching a minister of the crown ! John had been to Mass that morning and there prayed that he might be guided by justice in the coming trials and that he might be given strength to conciliate the people as his brother had imploredhim to do . Revolt , civil war  --  like the evil smell of brimstonein plague time  --  pervaded the air of the Painted Chamber , indeed the air of all England . The Prince thought compromise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . The indictment of Lord Latimer had been expected , the identity of their next quarry had not . A collective gasp rose from the lords ' benches as de la Mare called , " Lord Neville of Raby ! " " What 's this ! " cried Neville jumping to his feet and turning purple . His fierce little boar 's eyes glared at the Speaker and then at his hereditary enemy , Percy of Northumberland . He strode down the hall towards the Commons , his great chest swelling . He shook his fist shouting , " How dare you churls , ribauds , scum  --  to question me , a premier peer of the realm ! " Some eighty pairs of eyes stared back at him defiantly . He swiveled and charged through the center of the Chamber past the four woolsacks up to the dais . " You can not permit this monstrous act , Your Grace ! " The Duke 's nostrils indented and he breathed sharply . For Latimer he was not responsible , but Neville was his own retainer who had served him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the other Border lords , yet ever loyal to Lancasters . The Duke hesitated , then he said quietly , " It seems that we must hear , my Lord Neville , what they would say . "  |p303The  Speaker bowed and launched forth at once , raising his voice over Neville 's uproarious objections . The Commons ' charges of illicit commissions were trivial , a matter of two marks a sack in some wool transaction which Neville furiously denied , but he could not sustain his innocence . Their next accusation , that four years ago he had produced an insufficient number of men to serve in Brittany and then allowed these men to conduct themselves licentiously while awaiting shipment , Neville contemptuously refused to answer at all . Commons , considering that the charges were proved , requested that he be removed from all his offices , and heavily fined . This is ridiculous , thought John , ' t is only to insult me that they attack Neville . Though there had been slight dishonesty proved , what man among the Commons , what man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he tightened his jaw and held his peace . He waited for the next accusation in grim suspense and was relieved at the object of their final and most virulent attack  --  Alice Perrers . There was truth in what they said of Alice : that she was rapacious , venal and a wretched influence on the King ; that she bribed judges , forged signatures , and helped herself to crown funds and jewels . Moreover they said , it had been discovered that she was married and thus wallowing in flagrant adultery and that her hold on the King could only be the result of witchcraft . A Dominican friar had given her magic rings which produced enslavement . Nay , belike it was n't witchcraft , John thought , as he listened to this accusation . Her hold was simply that of gaiety , and a warmth , however spurious , to light an old man 's bones . Fear of death had come upon the King . What wonder that he fled from the gloomy monks who spoke only of the dangers of hell fire ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witty stories and listened sweetly to his meandering tales of long past battle ? Evil as she might be , it would go hard with the old man to have her banished from England , as Commons demanded . For I think he can not live without her now , nor live long anyway , thought John sadly . And he thought too of Katherine with the sharp twist of longing she always roused in him , and how miserable a thing it would be should outsiders try to part him from her . Yet Katherine and the Perrers were as unlike as a rose and a jackdawand it were shame to think of them in the same breath . He equably acceded to the Commons ' wish and had Alice summonedto the bar . She came before them soberly dressed and de/mure , her little cat face hidden by a veil , her head meekly bowed , which did not prevent her from casting voluptuous , imploring glances sideways at the Duke . He had her sentence softened to banishment from court , and they forced her to swear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would never again go near the King . Then they appointed two sergeants-at-arms to go with her and see that she obeyed . " And now , by God , " said Lord de la Pole to the Duke , on theday that Commons finished dealing with Alice , " I think we 're out of this stew . See  --  that sharp-toothed young de la Mare 's jaded at last , there 's no more bite in him . I was proud of you , my lord . ' T was no easy thing to let them override your inmost wishes and your loyalty . And yet I think it had to be , some of their claims were just and it may be wise to sacrifice royal prerogative at times , if it gain the love of the people . " " Ay , so my brother of Wales thinks , " said John , smiling into the bluff , affectionate eyes of the older man . " But by Christ 's sweet blood , now they must be contented . Is it too much to hope they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his friend with a sudden wistfulness . Before the baron could answer they were interrupted by a messengerwho rushed into the Painted Chamber and , throwing himself to his knees before the Duke , panted out urgent words . The Duke shook his head with a look of deep sorrow . He rose and held his hand out to still the hubbub . " Lords and commoners all , " he said , we must adjourn . The Princess of Wales has sent from Kennington . This time there is no hope of his rallying . " Edward of Woodstock , the Black Prince , died on Trinity Sunday , the eighth of June in his forty-sixth year . The King his father , and the Duke his brother , knelt by the bedside , and to those two he confidedthe care of his wife , Joan , and the nine-year-old Richard . The King and Duke kissed the Bible held out to them by the Bishop of Bangor to seal their oath . Then the old King beat his breast with loud lamentations and fell into a pitiable childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Duke and the bishop remained with the Prince until the end came , when John leaned down and kissed the brow which had been contorted with pain and was now suddenly at peace . As thep305Bishop of Bangor folded the gnarled warrior hands across the still breast , John left the bedside and walked into the antechamber , where the old King whimpered in his chair and stared with frightenedeyes at the crucifix that was fastened to the wall . Princess Joan knelt on a rich carpet beside her little son , holding him close and crooning to him tender mother words of reassurance . Richard 's body was stiff in her arms , his delicate girlish face was glassy from the horror of hearing his father 's last agonized cries . " It is finished , " said John crossing himself . " God give his soul rest . " The three in the antechamber made the sign of redemption , while the Princess gave a low shuddering sob . John slowly sank to one knee before the child . He took the icy little hand and laying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , King of Castile and Leon , Duke of Lancaster , do swear allegiance to thee , Richard , who art now the heir of England . " The child 's round cornflower eyes stared down at his uncle 's bowed head . This big magnificent man had always seemed a being as godlike and remote as King Arthur . Richard turned whispering to his mother . " Why does my uncle of Lancaster kneel to me ? " " Because you will be King of England , Dickon  --  when  --  " She glanced at the old man humped over in his chair . " Some day . " She looked down at her brother-in-law , and her tear-blurred eyes were beseeching . " God pity us , John , " she said , " and you must pity us . Who is there but you that can protect us now that my dear lord is dead ! " " I have vowed to protect you , my sister , and Richard shall be  --  by reason of his holy birthright  --  ever first with me and before my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said after a long moment . Little beauty remained to Joan of Kent , who had once been the fairest maid in England . Her forty-eight years had coarsened her . She had grown fat and the pure golden hair was brassy now with dye . Yet the feminine charm which had captured and held the Prince of Wales ' resistant heart had not faded . Despite her anguish for her husband and the fears she felt for the future of her son , she smiled at John and she touched his shoulder caressingly with her plump ring-loaded hand . " Christ and His Holy Mother guide us all , " she said very low . She looked from the handsome stern-faced Duke to the old King and then to the frail trembling child beside her.  |p306For  Katherine , the summer months were slow and heavy with longing . Kenilworth , scarce three days ' journey from London , was not isolated . Messengers went back and forth to the Savoy , and Katherine had the comfort of brief letters from the Duke , but she did not see him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too that he threw himself into whatever aspect of his life was uppermost with single-minded vehemence , and the news that came through from London made clear the enormous pressure put upon him now . Parliament sat on until mid-July . And there were the multitude of duties and arrangements resultant from the Prince of Wales ' woefuldeath . And the King was ill , had taken to his bed at Haveringat -- Bower , pining for the banished Alice more than for his dead son , so the people whispered . The Duke was virtually regent of England . Katherine strove to be reasonable . She played with her babies ; she supervised the studies and games of the older children ; she sat embroidering with Philippa and their women ; and often they all rode out with hounds and bows and the Duke 's foresters to hunt the roebuck . Katherine had become a fair shot herself under the Duke 's tutelage , and even Philippa enjoyed the chase . The months passed , and Katherine lived for the receiving and writing of letters . She had mastered writing now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly friar . She wrote to John of the children , and frankly of her love and longing , and she wearied him with no reproaches . Yet each time she picked up the quill and at many other moments too she wondered if he found time to visit Hertford , which was but a morning 's ride from London . And knowing that he must , her chest would churn with sick jealousy of this woman she had never seen . Costanza shared his bed , his name , his rank , however cold and foreign she might be , however little he might love her . When these thoughts overwhelmed Katherine , she would fight them with a frantic busyness  --  ripping out embroidery she had set and starting anew in a snarl of silks , or scandalizing the little Beauforts ' nurses by a total upset of routine when she seized her babies and carried them off to her solar for hours of impassioned cuddling . There were two at the castle who suffered with Katherine when they saw the strained feverish fits come on her : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The maid suffered in full awarenessof her mistress 's heart , and the child from instinct ; yet in both the result was the same  --  a resentment of the Duke . Hawise did not express it , knowing that would but hurt her lady more , andp307Blanchette was not aware that she hated the great powerful figure whom her mother loved . But it was during that summer that the little girl first took to weeping without reason and to wandering off by herself to hide in remote nooks of the castle or the grounds , nor would come out , until at last she heard her mother 's frightened voice , when she would let herself be found , and cling sobbing to Katherine . At last at the beginning of September , a messenger arrived from the Savoy and bore joyful news . The Duke summoned Katherine and some of the household down to London . " Ma tres chere et bien-aimee , " the Duke wrote to her in French , as he always did , and told her that he could not yet leave London ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied his daughters on the occasion of the annual obituary service for their mother , the Duchess Blanche , at St. Paul 's . He directed that she leave her Swynford children and the two Beaufort babies at Kenilworthwith their nurses , since the London air was not so healthful for little ones as that of Warwickshire ; and he ended with an enigmaticlittle quotation which was private to them . " II te faudra de vert vestir , " he wrote , and she finished it aloud laughing softly , " c'est la livree aux amoureux , " thinking of the first time they had said it to each other at the Chateau la Teste when she had worn , the green kirtle as they started for the Pyrenees . " Ay , now yell be merry as a popinjay again and juicy with love like a plum , " said Hawise , acidly coming into the solar with an armfulof Katherine 's white silk shifts and glancing at the letter . " Well , when does he come ? " " He does n't . We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new betaking ! " Hawise 's sandy eyebrows shot up . " Will it not cause talk , an ye go to London ? " Katherine 's glowing face hardened . " What more fitting than that I should pay respect to the memory of my beloved Duchess ? " Ay , you 've no cause to fear her , Hawise thought , but what of the other Duchess ? And she said , " There may be discomfortable things for ye to meet down there , sweeting . " Katherine lifted her chin . " I must chance it . Dear God , Hawise  --  " she turned with sudden passion , " do you not remember how long I 've been parted from him ? " Katherine , the two ducal daughters , Hawise and a score of householdservants journeyed down to London four days later . Blanchette cried frantically when her mother left , but Tom didp308not even bother to say farewell , having embarked at dawn on a rabbit-snaring expedition with one of the Deyncourt boys . Katherine worried about Blanchette for some time as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Avon . Beside the river bridge there stood a tavern , on its swinging sign was painted the Duke 's arms . She gazed at them lingeringly , thinking that despite the thousands of times she had seen it this blazon never failed to give her a thrill of delight . And she forgot Blanchette . At first the arrival at the Savoy was dismaying . She had not remembered how vast it was , how filled with people and commotion . Numerous as were the household officials , those of the chancery were greater . And too at the Savoy , most of the Duke 's retinue were quartered . Katherine was given a chamber to herself near the falcon mew and close to the ducal suite , but she felt nearly as remote from him as she had when first she stayed here at the BeaufortTower seven years ago . Hawise helped to dress her in green satin trimmed with seed pearls , and then Katherine waited two hours in her room without word before a page tapped on her door to say that His Grace wished her to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-remembered carved-oak table , frowningat a private missive to Wyclif , which he did not wish to dictate to a clerk . But he flung his pen into the sand cup and jumped up to give her greeting . He held out his arms and she ran to him with a low cry of joy . He laughed , holding her from him , looking at her so that her pulses pounded . " And so you 're wearing green , dear heart , as I asked  --  and I too . " He pointed to the lining of the dagged sleeves of his brocaded robe . " We 'll do full justice to love 's color , wo n't we , Katrine ! " He put his hand on her breast and kissed her avidly . He lifted her and carried her to the great crimson velvet bed which stood by the Avalon tapestry . Before the honied oblivion overwhelmed her , she thought of that other time so long ago when he had carried her to this bed ' , and she had denied him with fear and anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space of the thought 's flash she could not remember the reason . But it was because of Hugh , was it not ? The answer seemed to her as flatly meaningless as a problem on the abacus . More than Hugh though , she had been full queasy of conscience in those days , a priggish child . But she could not remember what that girl had felt . When their bodies were close they often caught echoes fromp309each other 's minds , and John , seeing the faint shadow in her languorouseyes , said , " Ay , darling , I never thought we 'd be here like this , that other time when you ran from me . " He laughed low in his throat . " Nor did I guess how hot a love my pope-holy little nun could show , though ' t is true she has the hidden mark of Venus . " He kissed a certain small brown mole . Quick rose dyed her cheeks , she pushed him away from her with mock anger , yet her voice trembled as she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have me more coy ? Maybe I should check your desire with stern looks and remind you that this is a fast day , and for conscience ' sake we must abstain ! " At this he laughed again , with tenderness . " Do you think my love could have been held so close by a cold and canting woman ? " He seized her hands as they shoved against his chest and holding them pinioned wide apart , looked down at her teasingly , and then with the darkening grimness of passion until her lips parted and she ceased to struggle . The Duchess Blanche 's Requiem Mass was to be held on her death day , September 12 . A week at the Savoy had passed in a delicious haze . Taking their cue from their lord , the courtiers showed no recognition of Katherine 's actual position , but there was an undercurrent of indulgent approval of the lovers . And except for the few of the ladies who were jealous of her beauty and would have liked to enjoy the Duke 's favors themselves , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day they held a fete champetre in the famous gardens . Tables strewn with thyme and loaded with simple country fare were set up beneath the rose arbors , and later the lords and ladies , glowing from the ale they had drunk , girded up their velvet robes to dance the hay and cut other rustic capers . On another sparkling morning the Duke ordered out his barges . All seven of them , garlanded , and canopied with tapestries , started down the Thames on a junket to Deptford . The Duke rode in his great barge of state with his two daughters , a half-dozen of his gentlemen  --  and Katherine . She sat on a cushion beside the Duke , her hand curled into his beneath a concealing fold of his outspread satin mantle , and dreamily watched the London banks stream by . Above the gabled houses the church spires pierced the violet sky like arrows , and the music of their bells nearly drowned out the gay songs from the minstrels ' barge . They floated swiftly with the tide like the cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely skimmed the water , the helmsman alone was brisk as he swung his wooden tiller to steer them amongst the teeming water traffic , produce and fishing boats , the pleasure barges of other nobles , and the ferries plying to and from the Surrey bank . They came to the Bridge with its load of higgledy-piggledy houses so squeezed it seemed that some must slide into the rushing current , nor was Katherine 's dreamy peace disturbed by the row of severed heads that were stuck on iron pikes along the Bridge . Though one young curly head was fresh and still dripped blood , she felt but a dim pity . There were always rotting heads on London bridge , and she neither knew who these men were nor for what crimes they had suffered . The sun sparkled on the water and the warm firm hand clasped hers tenderly beneath the mantle fold . Today John was relaxed and pleased to share with her his knowledge of the scene around them . He pointed out a galley from Venice , spice-laden so that the pungency of cloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English ship , Calais-bound , with a cargo of the precious wool . Once they laughed together at a drunken monk so fat he over-  --  weighted the wherry he was crossing in , and howled with rage each time his great rump splashed in the water . It was her last day of merriment . That evening they returned with the tide as the Savoy chapel bell rang for vespers . They disembarked at the barge landing and followed the Duke through the arch to the Outer Ward . Katherine saw at once from the throng of horses and people that some new company had arrived , but beyond noting that they must be foreigners , for there was something odd about their clothes and she heard words in a strange tongue , she thought nothing of so usual an occurrence . Except for a pang because the arrival of important guests would necessitate prolonged entertainment and inevitably postpone the hour when she and John might be alone . As she followed behind him she saw him start and heard him say " Christ 's blood ! " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of newcomers . She stood uncertainly by the bargehouse when suddenly her arm was clutched and she looked down at her sister . " Philippa ! " she cried staring at the plump face beneath the neat white coif . " What do you here ? " " My duty , naturally ! " said Philippa shrugging . " But I expected warmer greeting after the time we 've been apart . "  |p311Katherine  bent and kissed her sister on each cheek . " I was startled , I thought you at Hertford with  --  with  --  " She faltered , glancing towards the newcomers . Bitter coldness checked her breath . " Ay , so , " nodded Philippa . " The Duchess is here . To visit her wedded lord . She took the notion in the night , from a dream . HEr father the murdered King Pedro appeared to her and told her to come . Or so I 've gathered from the only one of her ladies who 'll speak English to the rest of us . Faith , Katherine , " she added pattingthe girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll have to make the best of it . Show me to your chamber . I dare say I can sleep with you ? " " Where will the Duchess sleep ? " asked Katherine very low . " In the ducal suite , of course . She always does when she comes here . " Katherine turned and silently led the way up to her chamber , where Hawise was drowsing by the fire waiting for her mistress . Hawise and Philippa greeted each other in the offhand manner of long but tepid acquaintanceship . " This 'll not be easy for my lady , " said Hawise , glancing at Katherine , who had moved to the window to stare out through the tiny leaded panes at the silver Thames below . " Bah ! She need n't fret . " Philippa hung her serviceable squirreltrimmedmantle carefully on a perch and bent to adjust her coif in Katherine 's mirror . " The Duchess has n't come for bed-sport , that I 'll warrant . " " How d'ye know that ? " Hawise saw Katherine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly , " she can not , if she would ; which sport I think was never to her liking . But since she gave birth at Ghent last winter an infirmity has gripped her in her woman 's parts . " Katherine turned slowly , her dilated eyes were dark as slate . " Then if this is true , she will but hate me the more , as I know I would . " " What whimsy ! " Philippa had no use for morbid speculations . " I dare say she never thinks of you at all . What wonder to her that the Duke should have a leman , indeed what great noble has not ? " Katherine flinched , her nails dug sharply into her palms . She turned back to the window and leaned her cheek against the stone mullion . " Ye shouldna 've said that . " Hawise scowled at Philippa , who was searching in Katherine 's little tiring coffer to find a pin . " Whyever not ? ' T is simple truth . By the rood , Hawise  --  canp312you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This coffer 's like a pie 's nest . Hark  --  there 's the supper horn . You must hurry , Katherine . " " I 'll not come down , " she said in a muffled voice . But to such folly Philippa would not listen . She flattened Katherinewith stern elder sister edicts . And her common sense , though devoid of imagination , was not untinged with sympathy . Katherine was here , the Duchess was here , sooner or later they must meet , best to get it over . Katherine , hastily attired by Hawise in the splendid apricot velvet gown , accompanied Philippa down and across the Inner Ward to the Great Hall , where the chamberlain separated them and seated each according to rank . Philippa went to the long board by the door where were fed the mass of commoners : heralds , squires , waitingwomen , friars , the lowlier chancery officials and their wives . Katherine , no longer entitled to her usual seat , since all room at the High Table was pre-empted by the Castilian retinue , was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . She slid quickly into place but could not raise her eyes from her pewter trencher which the varlets heaped with gobbets of smoking brawn . Yet soon she was forced to notice the knight beside her , Sir Esmon Appleby . He rubbed his foot against hers , he made play of brushing her arm as he reached across her to dip into the salt , he cast sideways looks into her bosom . She moved away on the bench , though wedged as she was between him and the elderly clerk of the Duke 's privy expenses this was difficult . Sir Esmon gripped his hand on her velvet-covered knee and whispered with wine-soaked breath , " No need to be so prim tonight , sweet burde . His Grace is occupied , pardee ! " " Leave me alone ! " she said , shaking with anger . " Nay , sweet heart , " the knight 's hand crept upward along her thigh , " play not the virgin with me ! I can show you many a lusty trick , I 'll vow His Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her trencher and slashed it down across the groping hand . " Jesu ! " yelped the knight , jumping up and staring at his welling blood . The lady next him squeaked with laughter , even the old clerk snorted into his cup as Sir Esmon , dabbing at his hand with his napkin , picked up his trencher and angrily moved to a place at the far end of the board . Katherine sat stiff and faint with humiliation , staring at her untouchedfood . At last she raised her head and looked at the High  --   |p313Table  , at the great high-backed golden chair beside the Duke which had always been empty till now . Dear Mary Mother , she thought . The misery which had receded with Philippa 's revelation in the chamber washed over her in a muddy flood . The Duchess was small and young . She was not ugly as they had said . Katherine , like one who can not cease from pressing on an aching tooth , strained her eyes down the Hall . Young . Four years younger than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine had known this , yet she had resolutely pictured the Duchess as middle-aged , and big with a haughty maturity . She had not guessed the smallness . The Duchess was dressed in somber gray . Katherine could see no jewels except her crown and a long sparkling pendant at her neck , which must be the reliquary she wore always and which Philippa said contained one of St. James ' fingers . Katherine looked from the glossy black wings of Costanza 's netted braids beneath the golden crown , to the dark eyes below . Even at this distance , one could see that they were large and brilliant , and they seemed to gaze out with brooding intensity from the long narrowface , even when the little head tilted towards the Duke . Katherine , watching in anguish , saw that they spoke but seldom together . His face that she knew so well in all its moods was set into the stern mask which she passionately told herself always hid boredom . But she could not escape noting another quality she had never seen in him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilt salver , drank from the same hanap , and Katherine saw that he held back from each sip and morsel , so that Costanza might partake first , and that every motion of his body and the carriageof his head showed obeisance . For Christ 's sweet mercy  --  will he not look towards me once ! Her fingers ripped a hunk from the soft white bread and kneaded it like clay . " You eat nothing , my lady ? " said the old clerk on her left . He looked at her curiously . " Nay , sir  --  I  --  I have a touch of fever . " She seized her wine cup and drained it . The thick heady vernage burned in her stomach . She picked up a breast of roast partridge , dipped it in the sweet pepper sauce then put it down again untasted . The meal dragged on . Katherine sat and waited for the moment when she might bep314released . He had no thought for her , he had forgotten the sweetness of last night , of this very day in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bitterness grew close to hatred . Ah , Katherine , where can you run to now , as once you ran from him ? Where in the whole of England could you hide from him now , he who pretends to love you ? Cold , cruel , heartless  --  so deep was she in her turmoil that she paid no heed to an announcement by the herald . She caught its echo only because of the buzzing of the people around her . The Duke had commanded that all those who had not previously been presented to the Queen of Castile should come up now as their names were called . This too , she thought  --  he wishes to humiliate me , to see me pay homage to his wife . And she steeled herself in anger . One by one , lords , knights , and their ladies were summoned by the chamberlain . Then she heard " Lady Katherine Swynford . " She walked stiffkneeddown the Hall , her cheeks like poppies . There were snickers quickly checked , and she felt the slyness of spearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , touching the * a. " small cold hand extended to her , but she did not kiss it . She raised her eyes as Costanza said something quick and questioning in Spanish , and she heard the Duke answer , " Si . " The women looked at each other . The narrow ivory long-lipped face was girlish and not uncomely , but seen close like this one felt only austerity . The black eyes glittered with a chill fanatic light . They seemed to appraise Katherine with the scrutiny of a moneylenderexamining a proffered trinket , and again Costanza spoke to the Duke . He leaned slightly towards Katherine , saying , " Her Grace wishes to know if you are truly devout , my Lady Swynford . Since you have the care of my daughters , she feels it essential that you neglect no religious observance . " Katherine looked at him then , and saw behind the sternness of his gaze a spark of amusement and communion . Her pain ebbed . " I have tried not to neglect my duties towards the Ladies Philippa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood the sense of this , as indeed she understood far more English than she would admit . She shrugged , gave Katherine a long enigmatic look , and waved her hand in dismissalas the chamberlain called another name.  |p315Katherine  quitted the Hall , walked slowly across the courtyard . Oh God , I wish I had n't seen her , she thought , yet he does n't love her , I know that . No matter that she is so young and a queen , it 's me that he loves , and it does her no real wrong  --  and she does n't care  --  one can see it , and she can not even bear him a son . Yet , Blessed Virgin , I wish I had not seen her . Throughout the sleepless night in her lonely bed , Katherine 's thoughts ran on like this . THE DUCHESS COSTANZA that night announced to the Duke that she wished to make pilgrimage to Canterbury at once . It was for this that she had come to London . Her father , King Pedro , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her certain things to tell the Duke . " He reproaches you , my lord , " said Costanza to John when they were alone in the state solar . Her Castilian women had been dismissedfor the night , having attired her in the coarse brown robe she now wore to bed . Her large black eyes fixed sternly on her husband , she spoke in vehement hissing Spanish . " I saw my father stand beside me , groaning , bleeding from the hundred wounds that traitor made in him . I heard his voice . It cried , Revenge ! When will Lancaster avenge me ! ' " " Ay , " said John bitterly , " small wonder he cries out in the night . Yet twice I 've tried  --  and failed . The stars have been set against us . I can not conquer Castile without an army , nor raise another one so soon . " " Por Dios , you must try again ! " " You need not speak thus to me , lady . There 's nothing beneath heaven I want more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop you ? " she said hoarsely . Into the proud cold face came a hint of pleading.  | " No , " he said startled , " of course not . " " Swear it ! " she cried . She yanked the reliquary from beneath her brown robe . " Swear it now by the sacred finger of Santiago ! " She opened the lid and thrust the casket at him . He looked at the little bleached bones , the shreds of mummied flesh and thick , ridged nail . " My purpose needs no aid from this . " She stamped her foot . " Have you been listening to that heretic  --  that Wyclif ? In my country we would burn him ! " Her shaking hand thrust the reliquary into his face . " Swear it ! I command you ! " Her lips trembled , red spots flamed on her cheekbones . " Bueno , bueno , dona , " he said taking the reliquary . She watched , breathing hard , as he bent and kissed the little bones . " I swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cross . " But the time is not ripe . The country is weary of war , they must be made to see how much they need Castile . They must  --  " he added lower and in English , " regain their faith in me as leader . Yet I think the people begin to look to me for guidance . They say that in the city yesterday they cheered my name . " She was not listening . She shut the reliquary and slipped it back under her robe . " Now I shall go to Canterbury , " she said more quietly . " My father commanded it . It must be that since I am in this hateful England , an English saint is needed also for our cause . I shall see if your Saint Thomas will cure me of the bloody flux , so I may bear sons for Castile . " The Duke inclined his head and sighed . " May God grant it , lady . " But if , he thought wryly , ' t is not God 's will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall submit with patience . He held out his hand to Costanza , and with the ceremony she exacted and which he accorded to her rank , he ushered her up the steps to her side of the State Bed . He held back for her the jeweled rose brocade curtains . She thanked him and shutting her eyes , began to murmur prayers . Her narrow face was yellow against the white satin pillow , and his nostrils were offended by her odor . Costanza 's private mortifications included denial of the luxury of cleanliness . Beneath the requisite pomp of her position , she tried to live like a holy saint , contemptuous of the body . In the first years of their marriage she had not been so unpleasing . Though she had brought to their bed only a rigid endurance of wifely and dynastic duty , still she had allowed her ladies to attire and  --  cleanse her properly at all times , and taken pride in the smallness of her high-arched feet , the abundance of her long black hair . She had been quieter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hadp317been moments when she showed him tenderness , had once spoken of love , which greatly embarrassed him . Only once however . And since the birth and death of the baby boy in Ghent , she had become like this , indifferent to all things but her religious practices , her strange dreams and her consuming nostalgia for Castile . John climbed into his side of the great bed , glad that space enough for two separated them . He heard her whispering in the dark , " Padre , Padre  --  Padre mio  --  " and his flesh crept , knowing that it was not God , but the ghost of her own father that she supplicated . Yet Costanza had no tinge of madness . Brother William had said so , three weeks ago when John had sent him to Hertford to examine the Duchess . " Disorders of the womb do ofttimes produce excitable humors in the female , " the Gray Friar had reported . " I 've given Her Grace a draught which may help her , but her Scorpio is afflicted by Saturn  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friar with stern unmistakable meaning . " Her Grace is nothing disturbed by my  --  my association with Lady Swynford ! " John had answered hotly . " She has never suffered from it , nor does she care . " " Maybe not , my lord . But God cares  --  and the sin of adultery you live in now is but the stinking fruit of the viler crime which gave it birth . " " What 's this , friar ? " John had shouted in anger . " Do you join my enemies in the yapping of vague slanders  --  or is it that your bigot mind sees love itself as such a vileness ? Speak out ! " " I can not , my lord , " said the friar after a time . " I can but remind you that Our Blessed Lord taught that the wish will be condemned even as the deed . " " What wish ? What deed ? You babble like a Benedictine ! You had better stick to leeching . " . " Do you pray sometimes , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ? " said Brother William solemnly . Until now , when Costanza 's behavior had reminded him of Brother William , John had put this conversation from his thought , deeming that the friar , like all the clergy , puffed himself up with the making of dark little mysteries and warnings . He had answered impatiently that no doubt Masses had been said for Nirac in St. Exupere 's church in Bayonne , since money had been sent there for that purpose . He had resented the friar 's steady accusing gaze and said , " It was not my fault that the little mountebank 's wits unloosened , or that he dabbled in witchcraft ! You weary me , Brother William . "  | " Ay , " said the friar , " for you 've a conscience blind as a mole and tough as oxhide . Beware for your own soul , my Lord Duke ! " No other cleric in the world could have thus spoken without instantpunishment , and the rage that injustice always roused in John had hardly been controlled by the long liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sent the friar away from the Savoy before Katherinecame . Sent him far north to Pontefract Castle , where the steward had reported several cases of lung fever . At the thought of Katherine , John stretched and smiled into the darkness . Tomorrow night she would be here with him again , since Costanza was leaving for Canterbury . Nay  --  not tomorrow night , for that was sacred to the memory of Blanche and would be spent in mourning and fasting , as always on this anniversary . The next night then . He hungered for Katherine with sharp desire , picturing her as she would be now in her bed  --  white and rose and bronze , warmly fragrant as a gillyflower . The Castilian Duchess left the Savoy next morning with six of her own courtiers and a few English servants . She was dressed in sackcloth , her head was powdered with ashes , and she rode upon a donkey , for that was the humble beast used by Our Blessed Lord . Katherine from her chamber window watched the pilgrimage move slowly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes shone with happy tears as she turned to her sister . " Blessed Jesu  --  so she 's gone again ! God be thanked she did n't stay for the Requiem Mass . " " The Duchess cares for no past but her own , " said Philippa dryly . " Now that I 've a fortnight 's leave , " she added considering , " I think I 'll go back with Geoffrey to Aldgate . His lodging must be in sore need of my care . Last time he 'd let an ale keg drip for days - ruined the floor cloth  --  and the fleas ! " " Geoffrey 'll meet us at Saint Paul 's ? " asked Katherine , but she knew the answer . He , of all people , would never fail in respect to the memory of Blanche . Katherine too thought of Blanche with loving reverencelike that one gave the saints . She saw her , gracious and fair , smiling down through the gold gates of heaven  --  for surely Blanche had ascended from purgatory long since . The horror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had diminished to a small lurid picture such as the monks painted on their vellums to show the agonies of hell . One gazed with mild shock , and then one turned the page . Later that morning , the Lancastrian procession from the Savoyp319to St. Paul 's Cathedral was led by the Duke . They were all dressed in black and all afoot . Katherine 's position was between Elizabeth and Philippa , behind little Henry , who followed his father at two paces . Katherine and John had exchanged hurried words while the processionformed . He had bent close to her and whispered , " Dear heart , we shall be together again tomorrow , " and she had pulled her black veil quickly across her face to hide her unseemly joy . As they marched across the Fleet bridge and entered the City at Ludgate , the Londoners made way respectfully . The men uncovered , many of the women ducked a curtsy as the Duke marched slowly past . There were cries of " Lancaster " and " The Duchess Blanche , God rest her sweet soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's voice somewhat thickened with drink shouted out , " Cock 's bones , but the Duke 's a handsome kingly wight , belike he 'd be no bad ruler for us after all ! " She was shushed by a hundred whispers , but John felt a contented glow . He thought that the temper of the London crowd was for him as it never had been before , and he thought that his poor brother had been right to counsel moderation in the handling of the Commons . " The Good Parliament , " the people called it now . And the sacrifice had not been too great , barring the whimperings of the old King , bereft of his Alice . The imprisoned merchants doubtless had deservedsome punishment , the Lords Latimer and Neville , too . The new Privy Council which Commons had appointed to the King was harder for John to stomach , and yet here too magnanimity might be shown ; for little Richard 's sake it might be possible to conciliate and work with even such enemies as the Earl of March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Paul 's immense nave , through the choir and to the right of the High Altar where he knelt in Blanche 's chantry beside her marble tomb . His retinue filed in . The nobles filled the choir , the rest overflowed into the aisles . Philippa , Elizabeth and Henry knelt on purple cushions at the far end of their mother 's chantry . The priests in black and silver chasubles commenced the celebration of the Mass . " Introibo ad altare Dei  --  ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam  --  " The chanting and responses went on , but for John three words echoed and re-echoed  --  Laetificat juventutem mean , the joy of my youth . He looked up at Blanche 's effigy , all but her face covered with a black velvet pall . The twenty-eight candles , one for each of her years on earth , illumined the serene alabaster profile . Joy of my youth  --  yes . But you would not begrudge me joy now , my Blanche , you know that you 've lost nothing that was ever yours in this new love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , a soft forgiving peace flowed over him . He heard Philippa weeping quietly , saw Elizabeth 's and Henry 's awed frightened eyes at the end of the tomb , and he longed to say to them , " Be happy . She wants us to be happy . " His exaltation grew , and with it a certainty that all would go well with him from now on . His enemies would melt away , success would come in war , in peace . Castile would crumble for him like a marchpanesubtlety , and he would build it up anew of strong and shining steel while all of England rang with the glory of his name , as it had once rung for Edward . " Requiescat in pace  --  " The Mass was over , John felt exalted , cleansed , much as he had felt long ago during the sacred vigil before his father knighted him . He walked down the nave . Throughout the vast church his people rose from their knees to follow him . He stepped out to the porch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not comprehendingwhy there was a great crowd in the walled close . Again he heard " Lancaster , " and he threw his head up to smile at them , thinkingthey came to do him honor . He checked himself , seeing that there was no answering warmth in the upturned faces . They appeared shocked , some even dismayed , but the strongest impact from those gaping faces was a malicious curiosity . " Make way  --  make way ! " cried Lancaster Herald , bustling out ofthe church and brandishing his baton and trumpet . " Make way for John , King of Castile , Duke of Lancaster , and for his meinie ! " The crowd did not move . There were a few nervous snickers , then from the midst of the rapidly swelling throng a man 's voice shouted , " Fine sounding titles , herald ! But tell us why we should make way for John o ' Gaunt , a Flemish butcher 's son ! " John stood rooted to the pavement . The sky darkened and across the close the roofs wavered like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine with the ducal daughters had come out on the porch in time to hear a man shout , but at first she was simply puzzled like the others . Then she saw whom the crowd was warily watching : like a great collective beast of prey , uncertain of its quarry 's next move . And the Duke did nothing , he stood as if some witchcraft had turned him to stone . Katherine instinctively moved nearer to him as the vanguard of his retinue began to trickle from the church.  | " Ay , " cried the same taunting voice , " John o ' Gaunt seems wonderstruck ! He 's not yet read the placard what 's nailed on yonder door . The good monk there was passing , and he read it to us , my lord , so we maught all share the secret o ' your true birth ! " Katherine , utterly bewildered , looked where the crowd did and saw two Benedictine monks hovering near a recess of the church porch . Their faces were sunk deep in their black cowls . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side door into the church . The crowd roared , half with laughter at the disappearing monks , half in the jeering excitement with which they would pelt stones at miscreants in the stocks . Yet some were uneasy . The Duke 's motionlessfigure was uncanny . He stared over their heads as though weird signs were painted on the western sky . Their spokesman shouted out once more , but in less certain tone . " Will ye not read the placard , m'lord ? T is on Paul 's door behind ye . It tells strange tidings o ' a noble lord what holds his head so high ! " Katherine 's heart began to pound . She noted something familiar in the voice and stood on tiptoe to peer into the crowd . She saw a broad red face , a sandy thatch of hair beneath a peaked cap with the badge of the weaver 's guild . My God , she thought , ' t is Jack Maudelyn ! She glared down at Hawise 's husband with some confused idea of quelling him , when Lord de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Christ 's blood , what 's ado here ! What 's this mob ? " His shrewd eyes darted over the scene , and he drew his sword , shouting , " A Lancaster ! A Lancaster ! Come forth to your lord ! " Inside the church there were startled answering cries . The great doors were flung wide . The Duke 's knights and squires came running out , fumbling at their sword hilts . The crowd wavered and pressed back against the wall , then as though a cork had been drawn they poured , stumbling , scrambling , through the churchyard gates , and fled up Pater Noster lane . " Shall we after them , Your Grace ? " cried a young knight eagerly . The Duke made no answer . He had not moved on the step while his retinue surrounded him . De la Pole sheathed his sword . " No , " he said to the knight . " ' T would not be seemly here on this day of mourning . ' T is no doubt some prentice prank . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got his first direct look at the Duke . " God 's bones , my lord  --  you 've not been wounded ? " The Duke 's face was gray as the church stones and beaded with moisture . His lips were drawn in like an old man 's . Katherine too stared at her love 's face , and she ran to him crying ,  | " My darling  --  why do you look like that ? They were but silly japes the man called out . " He shoved her aside , and walking to the church door , shut the half his men had opened . On the door dangling from an iron nail hung a large square of parchment . It was inscribed in English in a fine writing suggestive of the cloisters . The Duke clasped his hands behind his back and read it slowly . Know men of England , how ye have been wickedly deceivedby one who incontinently plots to seize our throne . The Duke of Lancaster is no Englishman , but a Fleming . He 's none of royal Edward and Philippa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that once in Ghent , the Queen 's Grace was delivered of a son that a nurse overlay . In fear of her lord the King , the Queen did send to find anotherinfant the same age . It was a butcher 's son , and he whom ye now call John of Gaunt . This secret did the Queen confess to the Bishop of Winchester , on her deathbed , so it is said . The Duke drew his dagger from its jeweled sheath . Its hilt was enameled with the lilies and leopards , tipped with a ruby rose of Lancaster . He thrust the dagger through the parchment and left it quivering there . He turned to his bewildered courtiers . He saw none of them , nor Katherine , nor his children . His face became one only his fighting men had seen , as his lips drew back in a terrible smile . " They shall learn whether I am Edward 's true-born son . " That night at the Savoy uneasy speculation hummed . In the kitchensand cellars , the varlets whispered together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the chapel priests buzzed as unceasingly , as did the Duke 's squires , or the knights and lords who headed his retinue . The Duke had gone to Havering-at-Bower to see the King . He had put off his mourning clothes and ordered his fastest horse to be saddled . Galloping as though Beelzebub 's own fiends pursued him , he had set off for Essex . He had chosen none of his men to accompany him , nor spoken to anyone : he had gone alone . This , a circumstance so unprecedented and foolhardy , that Lord de la Pole , anxiously frowning , spoke of it in the Great Hall that night . " God 's wounds ! Who can guess what 's in his mind ? He 's like a manp323bewitched ! " He spoke to Sir Robert Knolles , another old campaignerwho had served the Duke for twenty years . Sir Robert gnawed on his grizzled mustache and cried staunchly , " Why , he will avenge this insult to his honor . What man can blame him ? " " Yet such paltry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've whisperedfar worse of him than this farradiddle about a butcher 's son , or even that he plots for the throne . " " Whispered , ay , " said the old knight , " but this was written down . " De la Pole was silent . He himself , who could read a little , had awe of the written word , but to the common folk writing was a sacred oracle . " By God ! " cried de la Pole , angrily banging his hand on the table . " No one who saw him today could doubt him a Plantagenet ! D' you remember Prince Edward 's face at Limoges massacre ? No mercy , and no quarter when the fury 's on them . " " But that was war , " said Sir Robert . " His Grace can hardly massacrethe whole of London . " " Nay , and our Duke has keener mind than his brother ever had . He 'll find subtler means of vengeance . But , " he added frowning , " I can not guess what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Table , heard this conversation , and her troubled heart grew heavier still . Her hurt that he had no more thought of her than for the rest of his meinie was eclipsed by her suffering for him . She had read the placard . The shock it gave her was not at its absurd content but at the vicious hatred which had prompted it . And she who knew John better than anyone , guessed at some strange uncertainty , or fear . She thought of the night at Kenilworth , when he had said , " I 've been tilting with a phantom . " Her unhappiness culminated later in violent anger at Hawise . Katherineturned on her maid the moment their chamber door was closed and they were alone . " It was your jack , the whoreson churl , who shouted insults at my lord ! " she cried . " No doubt you knew it . You faithless slut , no doubt ' t is nothing to you to take the Duke 's bounty , while your own man sneers at him and yammers filthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeting , do n't , " she cried . " I didna know till now that Jack had aught to do wi ' that scrummage today . And God help me , but I love ye better'n him or mine own child . ' T is in part for this that Jack do hate the Duke . " Katherine turned and flung her arms around the stout neck . " I know , I know . Forgive me , " she cried . " But if you had seen my lordp324standing there  --  alone  --  on the step  --  I would have shielded him  --  I could n't " Hush , poppet , hush , " Hawise stroked the wet cheek and made the gentle soothing sound she used to Katherine 's babies . I 'll speak sharp to jack when I see him , she thought , but Jack cared little what she said any more . Since she had left him to serve her lady he had taken some Kentish wench to live with him . " ' T is nothing so grave after all , sweeting , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and meant no real harm . The Duke did n't know who ' t was shouting ? " Katherine shook her head . " Only I up there would 've known him . And my lord was dazed , you could see . Oh Hawise  --  " She shut her eyes with a long unsteady breath while the maid 's thick nimble fingers set to unfastening her brooch and girdle . " Sleep now , " said Hawise , " for ' t is late , and shadows cast by candle are vanished in the sun . The Duke'Il be back here wi ' ye on th ' morrow , I 'll take oath o n't . " But he was not . All through that autumn the Duke stayed at Havering Castle with the old King , who received him with delight , clung to him and mumbled gratitude to his dear son . For the Duke at once recalled Alice Perrers . He sent the King 's own men-at-arms to fetch her from her place of banishment in the north . He met her in Havering courtyardhimself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brocades and a whirl of musk , Alice flounced triumphantlyout of her chariot , her three little dogs frisking and barking after . She raised her thickly painted face to the Duke . " This is different , Your Grace , " said Alice with her sideways smile as she curtsied , " from that time at ' Westminster when you did bow to Commons and send me away . I thought you could not mean it . " Her wooing voice caressed him , she squeezed his hand softly . He withdrew his hand . " Dame Alice , much has changed since that day in the Painted Chamber , and now I bow to no man  --  or woman . " He looked at her in such a way that she was frightened , and she nodded quickly . " My lord , I 'll do your bidding in everything . I 've some influence in my own fashion ; but I  --  I  --  I do beg of you one more boon . " He inclined his head and waited . She breathed sharply , her green eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mare , " she said , watching the Duke closely yet sure of her ground . " I did not like the things he said of mc , my lord . " The Duke laughed , and Alice involuntarily stepped back . " The Speaker of the Commons already lies in chains in Nottingham Castle dungeon , " he said . " I shall decide what 's to be done with him after I deal with other matters . You may go now to the King . " One by one and day by day the Duke of Lancaster reversed all the measures which the reform Parliament had put through in the spring . He summarily dismissed the Privy Council that Commons had appointed . The Lords Latimer and Neville were released from their confinement and reinstated at court . The merchants impeached by Commons were released from gaol . The old King signed whatever papers his son gave him , much pleased that his beloved Alice and John were now in agreement , and mistily aware that he was helping to punish a pack of upstart rebels who had dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex at Havering Castle with his father , but after the first few days of inner frenzy , his mind regained control . His purpose became a staunch ship , steered by his skilful brain , and glidingrelentlessly forward along the cold channel of his fury . He had the force of the King 's authority and the King 's men behind him , and backed it by his own equally powerful Lancastrian feudality . He summoned key men of his retinue to Havering , he kept messengers galloping in a constant stream between Havering and the Savoy . He sent them farther afield to the far-flung corners of his vast holdings . From Dunstanburgh in the north to Pevensey in the south , from his Norfolk manors in the east to Monmouth Castle on the Welsh border  --  the stewards and constables were alerted to be ready in case of need . But there was no need . Commons had dissolved long ago . The members had scattered to their homes all over England . Their Speaker was imprisoned , and the lords and bishops who had given them supportnow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . All but the Earl of March and Bishop Courtenay of London . The Duke let the bishop be , for the present . Courtenay he would deal with later , and he had a special weapon in mind . But for theproper punishment of March , one ally was essential . The Duke sum-moned to Havering the powerful Border lord , Percy of Northumberland , and in an hour 's secret conference , showed him plainly where self-interest lay and how worthless had been March 's promises.  |p326The  frightened ' little Earl of March thereupon was ordered to leave the country on foreign service . He refused . Assassination on shipboardor in Calais seemed to him quite as possible as the already accomplished imprisonment of his steward in Nottingham dungeon . Instead he resigned his marshalship of England and fled across the country to barricade himself in Ludlow Castle . The Duke rewarded Percy 's rejuvenated loyalty to the crown with the abandoned Marshal 's staff . These measures it soon appeared were but preliminaries . At the end of October , the Duke attacked William of Wykeham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new LancastrianPrivy Council on charges of graft , and robbery of the public funds . So one morning the corpulent fifty-four-year-old bishop stood before the King , the Duke and the members of his council , facing them all with more bewilderment than anger . He had always been in high favor at court , he had been the King 's chaplain , the King 's architect , the Queen 's confessor , and Chancellor of the Realm . He had had no enemies until now . His pudgy fingers tightened on his crozier ; beneath his gorgeous red satin cope his portly belly rumbled with nervousness . " I can not understand , Your Majesty , " he began his defense to the King , but seeing that his old patron 's wrinkled eyelids had shut and the gray , crowned head was nodding , he turned to the Duke . " Your Grace  --  these charges , they 're outrageous ! They deal with matters ten years gone . " " But they were true  --  my Lord Bishop ? " " By the Blessed Virgin , how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every groat ? ' T is impossible , my lord . " " Maybe your memory will sharpen if you be relieved of the clogging burden of your revenues and temporalities , " said the Duke . " Holy poverty is much desired by the clergy , I believe . " He glanced to the corner of the chamber where stood a priest in plain dun-colored robes , ' John Wyclif , whom the Duke had called here from Oxford . They exchanged a grave slight smile . The bishop 's mouth fell open . His jowls quivered , his voice was shrill as he cried , " Your Grace , why do you persecute me ? There are many other bishops  --  you 've always shown me favor before  --  " The Duke 's eyebrows raised slowly . He folded his hands on his lap and gazed back at the flushed sweating face beneath the jeweled miter . " It can not be , " cried the bishop , suddenly perceptive , " that youp327believe I had aught to do with that preposterous changeling story ! " " The scroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Queen Philippa on her deathbed . " The Duke spoke so soft , the members of the council strained to hear , and the bishop stared with stupefiedeyes . " But the Queen confessed no such thing , Your Grace ! ' T is all a lie ! " " That I know , my Lord Bishop . But someone started this lie . Your name was written . " " By the Holy Trinity , it was n't I. You must believe , Your Grace , it was n't I ! " The Duke shrugged . " Yet you 've admitted your memory is faulty . " He glanced at his council . " The trial will proceed . " It proceeded and soon ended . The Bishop of Winchester was stripped of his rich manors , and his coffers full of gold . At one stroke all his worldly possessions were removed from him  --  though his episcopaloffice , even the Duke could not touch  --  for that had come down through St. Peter from God . The Duke 's retinue rejoiced . They swaggered and boasted of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of discomfited bishops . In the taverns and halls and on the streets they jeered also at the commons , and at the cocky bantling Peter de la Mare who had thought to defy the Duke and now found himself rotting in a dungeon . Alone of all Lancaster 's knights , Baron de la Pole had reservations . He had expressed them to the Duke and been sent away from Haveringfor his pains . On a November morning in his chamber at the Savoy , he was gloomily letting his squire array him in hunting costume when his page announced Brother William Appleton , and the barefoot friar walked in . " Well now , Brother , " cried the baron heartily . " I 'm glad to see you . How was it at Pontefract , are you just back ? " " Some time ago , " said the Franciscan . " I 've been staying with my brethren at Grayfriars . I hear strange things of His Grace . " " Not so strange ! " said the baron , instantly defending his Duke . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I hear , " said the friar , " that no act of the last Parliament has been suffered to stand , that the Speaker is imprisoned , the Earl of March banished . " " It is so , " said de la Pole . " I hear that the Bishop of Winchester is homeless , virtually begging his bread from door to door . "  | " Like a friar , my dear Brother , like a friar ! " de la Pole laughed . " ' Twill do the fat bishop no harm ! And remember , " the baron leaned forward , " it is to little Prince Richard that he gave all the bishop 's confiscated lands . That should stop their foul talk of plots against the child . " " Nothing but a miracle will stop talk . The Duke 's acts are frighteningthe people . " The baron sighed and sitting on a stool held his legs out for his squire to put on his leather hunting shoes . " He no longer cares . He wants only revenge . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friar sternly . " ' T was that placard . He knows not who put it there , or wrote it . So he strikes out blindly . ' Twill be Bishop Courtenay next . A tougher stick to break than Winchester was , and for this he 's using Wyclif . " The friar nodded . He had heard how Wyclif had been preaching in the London pulpits , preaching his doctrine of church reform and church taxation so that the burden of the people 's own taxes might be lessened . " An honest man , Wyclif , " said the friar thoughtfully , " and his teachings touched by Holy Truth , I think , but they may dangerously inflame the commons  --  " " Lancaster too is an honest man ! " broke in the baron , " though hot of temper like all his race . And still he 's shown forbearance . Mind you , Sir Friar , there 's been no bloodshed ! He 's even checked the King 's whore in her clamor to kill de la Mare . " " Bloodshed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knights understand . There are far worse sufferings . But ' t is not of that I 'd speak . " He glanced at the baron 's squire who was polishing the tip of his master 's spear . The baron took the hint and waved dismissal . Brother William sat down on a stool and explained . " All this that we 've been saying is common knowledge . I 'll not spread any rumor that is not . ' T is about that placard . I believe I know who wrote it . " " God 's nails  --  " breathed the baron , sinking back openmouthed in his chair . " Do you indeed ? His Grace has sent spies throughout the city to listen in the taverns and question offhandedly , but to no purpose . " The friar hesitated . This knowledge had not come to him through any secrets of the confessional , for if it had his lips would have been as sternly sealed as they were on another matter relating to the Duke . Shortly after his return to London from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at St. Bartholomew 's Benedictine priory , so great was his reputation as leech that even the monks called on him at times . As he had left the priory infirmary , he had been shocked to hear drunken voices coming from the scriptorium and a bleating laugh like a goat 's . He had been about to hurry past the door , thinking that the prior kept lax rule here , when the same bleating voice called out , " And this one 'll hang on Paul 's door too , ' t is better than the change-ling  --  " Someone said " Hist ! " and there was a sharp silence . The friar walked into the scriptorium . Two black monks , their foolishyoung faces red with the ale they had shared from a mazer , gaped at him blankly . The third man was perched on a high stool at a desk , a quill pen in his hand , a square of parchment under it . His robes and semi-tonsure showed him to be a clerk . His pock-marked face instantly became bland as cheese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution . " You make merry in here while you inscribe your scrolls ? " said the friar pleasantly , trying to edge near enough the desk to see what the clerk had written . " You treat of merry topics , Sir Clerk ? " One of the monks in evident confusion said , " This clerk is none of us , he but lodges here at the priory . He has lately come from Flan-ders . " " Nay , I 'm an Englishman  --  of  --  of Norvich , " said the clerk quickly in his bleating voice . " Johan of Norvich , I but spent a time in Flanders . " " Johan ? " said the monk in surprise . " We 've called you Peter  --  " " Johan  --  Peter  --  both . " The clerk slid off his stool , and the friar with keen disappointment saw that the scroll was blank but for two words " Know ye  --  " " Is't the custom at Saint Bart 's that Gray Friars haf right to nose around and question us ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mazer he took a long draught . The Gray Friar had made some civil remark and gone , but he had been mulling this matter over in his mind ever since . He had consultedhis superior , he had prayed on it , and now , knowing the baron 's loyalty and shrewdness , he had come to him . He told the baron what he had overheard , but added , " There 's no proof , they 'd say ' I heard wrong , the parchment with the two words will have vanished . And there is much that 's puzzling . Whate'er this clerk may call himself , he spoke with Flemish accent . And neverp330have I seen malice so pure in a man 's eyes . What can he have so harsh as this against the Duke ? The young monks are fools and swayed by this man though willing enough to spite Wyclif 's patron , no doubt . " " The clerk is being bribed ? " suggested de la Pole . " By March ? Or Courtenay ? " " Ay  --  mayhap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nub of the matter is  --  shall I go with this tale to the Duke ? " The baron pondered . " Not now . There 's no proof , and the Duke may be led to more blind violence . His rage is nearly slaked , ' twill all die down  --  if nothing further happens . The clerk and Benedictinemaybe will bate their tricks , since they must guess you heard them . " Nodding thoughtfully and with relief , the friar stood up . It went against his grain to carry tales that he had got by eavesdropping and he decided to wait for developments . It might well be too that the Duke would not receive him , since they had parted last on a discordantenough note . This reminded him of something and he said , " How is't with Lady Swynford ? What part has she played in all this coil of His Grace 's ? " " None at all , " answered the baron . " I doubt that he 's seen her since it started . " His face softened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savoy for days and then returned to Kenilworth , with the ladies Philippa and Elizabeth . And yet it seems he loves her dearly when he has a mind for love . " " A vile adulterous love , " said the friar grimly , pulling up his cowl and adjusting the knotted cord at his waist . " God will scourge them for it . "  |p331KATHERINE  kept Christmastide alone with the children at Kenilworth . The Duke divided his festivities between his father at Havering and his nephew , little Richard , who remained with the Princess Joan across the Thames at Kennington . His establishment at Kenilworth was not , however , entirely forgotten . In February , the Duke sent belated New Year 's presents to everyone , and a silver-gilt girdle for Katherine herself , but the accompanying note was stilted , though it indicated that she should return to the Savoy for a visit with the Lady Philippa , that there was an envoy coming from the Duchy of Luxemburg who wished to see Philippa with a view to possible marriage negotiations . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private message to Katherine . He sent the note and the gifts by a new young squire Katherine did not know , a Robert Beyvill , who was to escort the ladies back to the Savoy . Katherine received the letter while she sat amongst her householdin Kenilworth 's beautiful new Hall . She kept rigid control of her face as she read and thought , Dear Mother of God , he has then really ceased to love me or he could not write thus . I shall not go  --  I 'll refuse . Even as she thought this , her heart began to deny it . His love had been buried but surely it was still there despite the evil demon , or whatever the incubus was , that drove him . She must not let her pride strike back at him , since he had again summonedher , no matter how coldly . She would go to London . And underneath ran bitter realization . What choice had she but to obey ? This castle was his , the bread she ate , the clothes she wore came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like his children , like this young squire who stood waiting respectfully before her , she had no course but submission . Suddenly she thought of Kettlethorpe . That place was wholly hers , her widow 's rights had been confirmed . How small and mean it was compared to these lovely castles where she lived now here , now there , at the Duke 's whim ; and yet that crumb of far-off Lincolnshirewas the only thing in the world entirely her own . The thought was fleeting . She looked at her little Swynfords  --   |p332Blanchette  's golden curls bent over a grubby bit of embroidery while Philippa gravely helped her , Tom whittling an arrow on the hearth  --  both well grown , finely clad , and educated better than most nobles ' children . And she thought how much they had profited by their mother 's situation . She turned her eyes to the young squire and said quietly , " Then we must make ready to leave for London , must we not ? What are you named , sir ? " " Robert Beyvill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Robin , " she said with her sudden enchanting smile , thinking him well-named . He had sharp eyes , a curly brown head , and his tunic was a bright rusty red . He was tall and merry-looking . Altogetherfar more pleasing a squire than Raulin d'Ypres had been  --  or Ellis . Katherine rose abruptly and poured wine for Robin . She never allowed herself to think long of Hugh 's erstwhile squire . She had seen Ellis once in Lincoln when little John was born . She had met him by chance as she walked up Pottergate to the house the Duke had leased for her . Ellis had stopped squarely in front of her , his heavy Saxon features twisted to a mask of loathing . " Whore ! " he had cried , and spat directly into her face . She had not told the Duke the whole of it but she had seen to it that Ellis de Thoresby was sent off to his estates in Nottingham . " I daresay Lady Philippa and I sha n't be gone long , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke soothingly , for she knew there would be bad moments with Elizabeth , who adored the gaieties of London and resented being left out of anything . Worse than any tantrums Elizabeth might have was the stricken look in Blanchette 's eyes as the little girl raised them to her mother . Plain as speech they said , And so you leave me again  --  for him . " Come here , darling , " said Katherine to her . " Shall we sing Havelock the Dane ? Will you play it on your lute ? " That was the child 's favorite ballad , and it used to be that to the point of wearinessshe begged Katherine for it . But Blanchette shook her head and lowered it over the embroidery . " No , thank you , Mama , " she said in a dull flat little voice . Katherine , Philippa and Robin Beyvill , the squire , left for London on the fifteenth of February , accompanied by the usual escort of men-at-arms , varlets and baggage carts , while Hawise , and Philippa 's waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling coffers.  |p333Robin  enlivened the way by telling the two ladies all that had been happening in London , but Philippa did not listen as she rode sedately along on her white mare . She was praying to the Blessed Virgin , supplicating that understanding Lady with conflicting petitions . First , that the marriage negotiations with Luxemburg would come to naught and second , that she would always have the will to obey her father . But Katherine listened eagerly to the squire and learned more about the Duke 's activities than she had ever known . Robin had an uncritical admiration for his lord , whom he had served four years , though only recently promoted to be one of the Duke 's own personal squires . There was plenty of time for talk as they wended along the frozen muddy roads , and Katherine 's interest was enlivened by feminine amusement when she discovered that Robin was casting her in the classic role of the unattainable lady fair . He had too much humor to sigh and groan , as the love-stricken squire should do , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped her to dismount , he blushed when she looked at him , and once when she dropped a sprig of holly which she had been wearing on her bodice , she saw him stealthily pick it up and , kissing the red berries , slip the whole twig into his pouch . Katherine 's sore heart was warmed by this adoration , in which she saw no danger ; after all , the lad was barely twenty , and she full twenty-six . She relaxed with him and enjoyed his company , perhaps all the more so because Robin was not of high blood . His father was a franklin in Suffolk , a prosperous one , who farmed ample lands and owned a new half-timbered house . Robin went on to say proudly that his father , Richard , was even now sitting in Parliament at Westminster , a new member of the Commons . " For , " said Robin laughing , " the Duke has seen to it that this Parliament shall be properly packed with his own supporters , so there 'll be no trouble like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what had passed last spring except that the two lords she knew , Latimer and Neville , had got into difficulties but were now released . No one spoke to her of national affairs , but since the incident of the placard , she had been shaken into more awareness . They jogged out of Buckinghamshire towards Woburn Abbey , where they would sleep that night , while she considered what Robin had said and she spoke thoughtfully . " So all goes well with His Grace now ? He has no more enmities to fight against ? " " God 's body , lady , I would n't say that ! " Robin laughed again ,  |p334then  sobered and turned sharply in his saddle . " There 's still the bishops ! May the devil 's pitchforks prick their fat rumps until they 've bled out all the gold ! " " Robin ! " cried Katherine . Philippa looked up from her vague gazing at the road . " Are you a Lollard , Sir Squire ? " she said stiffly ; her long mild face showed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of piety that Philippa dared differ from her father 's views . " I ask your pardon , my lady , " said Robin to Philippa , " I spoke too crude . " But his eyes never lingered on the girl , and they returnedat once to Katherine as he explained eagerly , " I but feel as Wyclif does , and our lord the Duke . We 've had the poor preachers ' come to our home in Suffolk  --  they 're good honest men , lady . " " Welladay , " said Katherine , uninterested in Wyclif 's preachers or indeed in Wyclif . " What is it between the Duke and the bishops now ? " " They most damnably defy His Grace ! " cried Robin , his brown eyes flashing . " The Bishops ' Convocation has dared to summon Wyclif for trial at Saint Paul 's on Thursday . ' T is Courtenay 's doing . " Katherine could see no reason for Robin 's vehemence . The bishops were powerful , of course , everyone knew that , but the Duke was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some struggle over Wyclif seemed to her of scanty importance . She now thought that she had been overly frightened for the Duke when he had faced the mob that jeered about the placard ; and as they drew nearer to London she began to wonder with increasing anxiety what was really in her beloved 's heart , and to suffer a miserable , vague jealousy , not of Costanza ; but there were plently of designing ladies at court . And he had apparently been seeing much of Alice Perrers  --  and the Princess Joan . John was not aware that he had neglected Katherine . There were times when he longed for her and desired her , but these emotions took place at the back of his attention and were overwhelmed by the obsession which had come to him . The demonstration of power was a drink heady as the strongest metheglin ever the wild Saxons brewed , and yet continual imposition of his will did little to appease the pain which drove him on to further fight . This pain smoldered like a hidden coal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery lump that rose into hisp335throat and stuck there , so that he choked and gasped and sweated as he tried to swallow it down . Alone in his great State Bed , he would roll in shameful distress , clenching his fists and struggling for each breath , until at last he fell back exhausted and the thing dissolved . Then he would think of witchcraft and pull himself from bed to pray at Blanche 's prie-dieu in the corner of the chamber . In the mornings he could barely remember what had happened , and would awaken with increased passion to outwit his enemies . On Wednesday , February 18 , he rose after a badly troubled night and angrily shouted for his squires to come and dress him . His head ached and he was annoyed at the lateness of the hour . Parliament would open today at eight , and he must hurry to Westminster . This docile Commons was voting as it should , but they needed constantguidance . Just as he was leaving the Savoy he remembered to summon the chamberlain , and told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lady Swynford , who might arrive today from Kenilworth . The chamberlain looked startled . The MonmouthWing was not where Lady Swynford had lodged before , and it was half the length of the Savoy from the Duke . The Duke caught the flicker in the man 's eye , and some realization of Katherine'sfeelings pierced his preoccupation . But nothing on earth would induce him to let anyone see him in those humiliating nightly attacks , and besides he had no time for love . He flung himself onto his horse and pursued by two of his squires galloped along the Strand to Westminster . After the day 's session , he dined in the Hall with many of the lords . Percy of Northumberland sat on his right . They had much to discuss about Wyclif 's trial tomorrow at St. Paul 's , and the showdown with Bishop Courtenay . " But , " said the Duke , sipping without relish some very fine malmsey , " we must be temperate , Percy . Wyclif should be his own best advocate . " Northumberland irritably hunched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking sturgeon from the platter offered him by his kneeling son , who was acting as his squire . The baron crammed his mouth full , sputtered with pain and spewed the fish out onto the rushes . " Sweet Christ ! M'tongue 's burned off ! " He clouted young Percy violently on the ear . His thirteen-year-old son had a temper to match . " ' T is not myp336fault , my lord , an you gobble like a swine ! " he cried throwing down the platter . Father and son glared at each other . The blue Percy lions on their surcotes jigged in and out with their fierce breathings . Then the baron thwacked his heir across the shoulder , upsetting him into the filthy rushes . " Hotspur , Hotspur ! " he roared , slapping his thigh . He turned to the Duke , " Saw you ever such a game cockerel  --  dares flout its own sire ! " " Certainly your young Hotspur shows a spirit which will be useful to keep the Scots in order , " said the Duke dryly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ay  --  the Scots  --  " said Northumberland , rinsing his blistered mouth with wine . " First we must keep London in order . " " You can not tamper with the City 's liberties , " said the Duke firmly . They had been through this before . Percy , as new Marshal of England , was continuously annoyed that the City did not admit his jurisdiction . " Hen piddle ! " cried Percy . " That pack of baseborn tradesmen  --  what right have they to liberties ? Let the mayor stick to his needles and threads , ' t is all he 's fit for . " " If you abolish the mayoralty and take to yourself the ruling of the City , do you think the Londoners 'll submit ? " " By the rood , they 'd have to ! Jam the bill through Parliament , through their own Commons . They 've awe enough of that ! " The Duke turned away . His ally 's loud voice rasped on him . The headache which had plagued him all morning began to throb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort . Later that afternoon as London church bells were ringing for vespers the Duke and Lord Percy rode into the City bound for the latter 's town residence at Aldersgate . This mansion was but a few hundred yards beyond St. Paul 's , and it had been decided to use it for headquarters . En route from Westminster to the City , the Duke had stopped at the Savoy to pick up certain of his men and Brother William Appleton . The Franciscan , now fully reinstated in the Duke 's favor , was to be one of Wyclif 's advocates . The other three  --  a Carmelite , a Dominican and an Austin  --  were to meet them at Percy 's " inn . " A bleak wintry drizzle began to fall as the Duke and Percy precededtheir followers up Pater Noster lane along the wall of St. Paul 's close . The little ecclesiastical shops were boarded for the night , and the streets were nearly deserted , for the citizens were at home by their firesides.  |p337They  crossed the wide market place at ' West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and only the lowing of penned cattle from the shambles disturbed the quiet . They entered St. Martin 's lane , and at the bend where it narrowed by the Goldsmiths ' Hall , the Gray Friar suddenly saw three figures in the gloom ahead . Startled , he stood up in his stirrups and peered over the Duke 's shoulder . There was still light enough to recognize two black-habited monks and a third shorter man in a dark cleric 's robe . The three figures paused and wavered in a moment of obvious confusion , when they saw the horsemen approaching . Brother William caught the flash of something white and stiff being thrust into the clerk 's sleeve . " My lord ! " cried the Gray Friar , " we must catch that man ! " He kicked his mule and clattered past the astonished Duke . The two monks swiveled and , hiking up their robes , pelted as fast as their legs would take them towards Aldersgate . The clerk limped franticallybehind , while his head jerked this way and that searching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to dart into an alley , and swooping down with a long arm , collared a handful of cloth . The Duke galloped up as the struggling clerk had nearly freed himself and , leaning from the saddle , grabbed the man 's wrist . " What 's this , Brother William ? " cried the Duke with some amusement , his powerful grip tightening on the plunging wrist . " What games do we play with this wriggling little whelp ? I never knew you so sportive . " The friar had flung himself off his mule , and plunged his hand into the clerk 's sleeve . He brought out a roll of white parchment and squinted down quickly in the waning light . " This is the man , my lord , who wrote the placard on Saint Paul 's door , " he cried . The Duke started , his grip loosened , and the clerk , twisting suddenlyfree , would have made off but a score of retainers had come up , and he was surrounded . He stood still in the central gutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bind him , " said the Duke in a deadly quiet voice . A squire jumped forward with a leather thong and tied the clerk 's wrists behind his back . " Take him to my inn ! " cried Lord Percy . " We 'll deal with him there . " The clerk suddenly found his voice . " You ca n't ! " he shrilled.  | " You haf no right to touch me ! I know my rights . I claim the City 's protection ! " In windows of houses past the Goldsmiths ' Hall a few heads peered out cautiously . " Hark at him ! " roared Percy . " Hark who speaks to the Marshal of England . Take him , men ! " The clerk was picked up and rushed down the street to Percy 's gate . The Duke and Percy followed . The courtyard gate closed behind them . They dragged the clerk into the house and flung him down on the floor of the Hall . He hitched himself slowly to his knees , then to his feet . He stood swaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands opening and closing spasmodically behind his back . The retainers of both lords crowded around , staring curiously , eager to inflict more punishment . As it was , blood dripped from the long ferrety nose , and a lump big as a chestnut rose from the bald spot in the tonsure . " We 'd best flog him , afore he 's put in the stocks , " said Percy with relish . " What 's he done , by the way ? " He looked at the Duke , who was standing six feet from the clerk and regarding him fixedly . The Duke held his hand towards the friar without answering , and Brother William gave over the large square of parchment . " Bring me a light , " said the Duke . A varlet ran up with a torch . The rustlings and murmurings ceased , the Hall grew still while they watched the Duke read , until he raised his head and said , " This time it seems that I  --  John of Gaunt  --  for reason of my base birth am therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles of France to sell him all England . " There were a few gasps , Percy 's red face grew redder , but nobody moved . The Duke took the torch from the varlet and bending down held it near to the prisoner . " Let me see your face ! " The clerk 's knees began to quiver , he hunched his shoulders higher around his ears and the sound of his breath was like tearing silk . The Duke knocked his head up with a blow of the fist beneath the chin and stared down by the torchlight . Suddenly he reached out and yanked the clerk 's collar from his stringy throat . A jagged white scar ran from the jaw to the Adam 's apple . " And so it is you , Pieter Neumann , " said the Duke softly . He handed the torch back to the varlet . " You still bear the mark a boy made on you thirty years ago at Windsor . " " I do n't know what you mean , Your Grace . I am Johan , Johanp339Prenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in France , I fought well in France for England , Your Grace . I know not what is on the parchment , it vas the monks at Saint Bart 's wrote it . I 've clone no harm  --  " " He lies , my lord , " interrupted Brother William solemnly . " For I myself saw him writing on the parchment . " " He lies  --  " said the Duke . " As he always lied  --  lied  --  " he repeated , but in the repetition of the word , the friar heard a wavering . He noted this with astonishment . What could it be that the Duke doubted , what uncertainty had caused that stumbling inflection , and what earlier association could there have been between these two ? " We 'll hang him ! " cried Lord Percy , who had finally comprehendedthe situation . " Haul him out to the courtyard ! " Four of his men sprang forward . " Wait  --  " The Duke held up his hand . " Take him to some privy place , put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . " Percy 's men hustled the clerk through the kitchens and below stairs to the cellars , where in the darkness there was a small dungeon . The clerk 's wrists and ankles were clamped into the holes in the wooden stocks , and the men pulled savagely on his twisted leg to make it fit the hole . The Duke had followed them . He watched impassively while the prisoner groaned and cursed and tried to ease his dangling rump on the dungeon paving stones . Then he said , " Leave a torch in the bracket and go . " Percy 's men obeyed . The Duke , clanging shut the iron door , leaned against the wall " You suffer now , Pieter Neumann , " he said , " but you will suffer far more than this before you die , if you do n't speak truth to me . Where have you been since that day at Windsor Castle when you did steal your mother 's purse and ran away ? " Pieter 's eyes slithered to a heap of rusty chains and fetters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where ? " " In Ghent gaol and at the Abbaye de Saint Bavon vere you were born , Your Grace . The monks taught me to write . " A sly hope came to him as he noted a change in the Duke 's face when he mentioned the abbey . He rested his chin on the rough plank top of the stocks and waited . " What brought you to London ? " Pieter considered quickly . He had fled from Flanders after steal/ing a gold chalice from the abbey church , landed off a fishing boat in Norfolk and made his way here knowing there would be more scope for his talents . He had not been disappointed . " I longed to see England again , " he said , " the country vere my poor mother died  --  Isolda , who nursed you and loved you so , my lord  --  " he added in a sort of hissing whine . The Duke 's breathing quickened , he bent over crying , " And who has paid you now to write these placards ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug in until the bones crunched . The clerk whimpered and twisted , finally gasped out , " Courtenay . " The Duke straightened up . " By God  --  " he said under his breath . " Would even the Bishop of London stoop so low ? " " If you set me free , my lord , I could write another placard , " whispered Pieter . " I could say that after all you 're no changeling , that  --  " He broke off and screamed , " Ah  --  Your G-grace  --  haf mercy  --  nay , nay do n't ! " Plain in the torchlight he had seen murderleap in the Duke 's eyes . John folded his arms and leaned back against the dripping fetid wall stones . " Did you think that the King 's son would kill you as you hung there trussed like a fowl on a spit , my poor Pieter ? Nay , ' t is not so you shall die  --  though how you shall die I 've not yet decided . " He smiled quietly and turned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leaf me here like this , I-I 'll crawl on my hands and knees , I 'll kiss your feet , I 'll  --  " The Duke opened the iron door and going out into the cellar , banged the door behind him and shot the bolt . He walked down the passage between rows of piled wine casks until he reached the steps up to the kitchens . From there he could no longer hear the echo of Pieter 's hysterical cries . Katherine and her companions duly arrived at the Savoy that afternoon . The bowing chamberlain met them in the Outer Ward and informed them that His Grace would not be there this night , he was staying with the Lord of Northumberland in the City . The chamberlain had been given no special messages for either lady , and doubted whether His Grace would even return on the morrow , since it was known that he intended to sup in the City after the trial at St. Paul 's . Philippa let out a long sigh of relief . No marriage talk for the present anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dragging step . If this banishment to a part of the Savoy so remote from him were truly a symbol of the way he wished it to he between them , why then had he summoned her here at all ? She did not leave her chamber again that night , but lay sleepless on her bed , staring into the shadows with hot aching eyes . The next day she sent Hawise to fetch Robin from the squire 's dormitory and when he eagerly presented himself , she told him that She wished to attend the trial today in the cathedral and asked him to accompany her . She felt that she must see John again , no matter what the circumstances , and that then perhaps she would know what was amiss between them . Robin assented blithely . His eyes sparkled at the thought of escortingher anywhere , but particularly to a spectacle which promised some excitement . Hawise was grimly disapproving . " You 're full young and brash , m'lad , to have the care of our lady here , there 'll be a rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her from harm ? " " That I can , you old mulligrubber , " said Robin , chucking Hawise under the chin . " You know well , " he said , giving Katherine a soft yearning glance , " I 'd give my life for her gladly , if t'were needed . " " Humph , " said Hawise with an unwilling smile , " sheep 's eyes , calf talk  --  nay , lady dear , ye must n't wear that gown ! " Katherine , hardly listening to them , had pulled the gorgeous apricot velvet robes from her traveling coffer and was smoothing down the ermine bands . She looked up astonished , then flushed . She had been following instinct in planning to make herself beautiful , but she knew that Hawise was right . " The old gray woolsey , and your plain russet mantle , " said Hawise with decision , lifting these garments from the coffer and shaking them out . " ' T were best ye be not noticed , an ye must go . " She did not add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a raven perching on the Duke 's great coat of arms that hung over the gatehouse . She understood her mistress 's heartache and frantic desire for action , but she was uneasy . When she sent Katherineforth with a quick hard kiss , she crossed herself and on rare impulse went into the palace chapel for a prayer . Katherine and Robin arrived early at St. Paul 's , but it was already jammed . The mayor and his aldermen , and their wives , filled the choir aisles ; while packed around them stood members of the great guilds : the vintners , the goldsmiths , the mercers , the grocers , all recognizable by their banners.  |p342The  nave overflowed with a surging restless mass . There were prentices in their leather jerkins , tavernkeepers and alewives , clerks and a goodly sprinkling of monks . There were professional archers with metal breastplates and long quivers , and heavily bearded seamenwho happened to be in home port between voyages . There were whores with ray hoods , and bandaged beggars with crutches . The largest nave in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Londoners who wished to see their bishop defy the Duke of Lancaster . Folk clambered on the tombs , they clung to the window ledges and the carved-stone traceries of the pillars , but still more kept pressing in . Robin shoved and coaxed and threatened until he got Katherine nearer to the Lady Chapel . Here all the bishops were assembled around Sudbury , the gentle old Archbishop of Canterbury , who looked and doubtless felt distressed , for he was ever a man of peace . Robin put his hands around Katherine 's waist , and blushing a little at this liberty , lifted her to a high perch between two iron bars of a chantry . Katherine looked first towards Blanche 's tomb , and could see the brightly painted stone canopy and the wrought-iron grille that en-closed her chantry , but not the lovely alabaster face . Still she felt a little comforted by her nearness to Blanche . They waited a long time , and the crowd grew restless . There were stampings of feet and impatient whistles , when high in the tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine craned forward and saw William Courtenay , Bishop of London , appear majestically on the choir steps . He held his crozier at arm 's length to rest the tip on the tapestried carpet , and stood like a Roman general , awaiting the homage of a conquered people . Then she heard shouts at the great door . Her head turned with a thousand other heads to look down the nave . She saw a stockyman in armor covered by a surcote embroidered with blue lions . He waved a shite staff and shouted , " Get out o ' the way , you scurvy knaves . " His arms threshed like flails , and she saw him pound someone'shead . " Who is it ? " Katherine whispered . Robin , standing on tiptoe answered , " Percy , with his marshal 's staff . The people wo n't give way for him . " The Bishop of London descended the choir steps and called out angrily to Percy , " What entrance is this you make into the Housep343of God ! Throw down your staff or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Katherine did not hear the answer , for behind Percy and topping him by a foot , she saw John . The Duke stood where a ray of amber sunlight streamed through the painted glass of the western window onto his head . The blue and red velvet of his sleeves , the three ermine tabs on his chest , the lilies and leopards of his surcote , the gold of his coronet all glowed in a soft yellow nimbus , while his face seemed to shine . Humility struck Katherine , even shame that she had dared to expect love from such a man as this . But then the Duke strode forward , pushing past Percy , and hurried to the choir steps . She could hear nothing that was said , but she saw that he shouted something to the bishop , who shouted back , and that there was great wrath between them . The Duke plunged again amongst the muttering people and led forward Wyclif and four friars . The priest walked sturdily with downcast eyes and the crowd fell back , for many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not Wyclif that they feared . Wyclif entered the Lady Chapel and the people surged forward again . They climbed up onto each other 's shoulders so as to see . Katherine 's view was blocked but not her knowledge of what was taking place , for those in front called back to others and murmurs blew like wind throughout the church . " The Duke demands a seat for Wyclif ! Our bishop will not allow it ! "  --  " Now Percy shakes his fist in the bishop 's face . "  --  " The archbishop seems to plead and try to calm them but no one listens . "  --  " Now by God 's body  --  Lancaster  --  " " Oh , what 's happening ? " cried Katherine in an agony . She heard nothing but " Lancaster " as a sullen roar like mounting surf beat to the vaulting of the church . Robin cried , " I can not tell . Sweet lady , I must get you out from here  --  " But he saw no way to move her through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " The Duke threatens our bishop  --  Jesu , he 's drawn his sword  --  Lancaster would kill  --  " " Kill  --  kill  --  kill  --  " Like the senseless repetitions of a nightmare , a thousand voices bawled the word . There was a sharp crack of wood from the rood screen as the mob heaved against it . The tapers rocked in their holders . A woman screamed . " Quick ! " cried Robin , " we 'll try for that door . " He scooped her off her perch and holding her tight in his left arm edged backwardp344along the wall to a small recessed door . Sweat broke out on his forehead when he found that it was open . He pushed Katherine through . They were in the cloisters . From there a gate led to the churchyard and through the gravestones on to Watling street . Katherine had obeyed her squire blindly , so frightened by that roaring mob that she could not think . But on the street she clutched Robin 's arm and cried , " What will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . " " No harm can befall our Duke , " cried Robin fiercely , wiping his forehead on his sleeve . " I must get you to safety  --  ' t were madnessto stay in there , ' t would do no good  --  " " Yes , yes , " she cried , " then take me to the Pessoners in Billingsgate  --  ' t is near . Hurry , Robin , hurry  --  so you may go back  --  " He nodded instantly and they ran together through the streets towards the Bridge until they came to the fishmonger 's half-timbered house on Thames street . " Lady Katherine ! " cried Dame Emma in amazement as she opened to their frantic knocks . " Let me stay here , " panted Katherine . " Robin , run back and see  --  then tell me  --  " She sank onto the settle by the bright fire and struggled to catch her breath . Dame Emma was alone , the children were working on the fish wharf , the maids all in the brewhouse grinding malt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the still room for a bunch of dried sage , prime remedy for nervous upsets . When the brew was cool enough , she brought it to Katherine and made her drink it with the same kind firmness that Hawise had inherited . " Cock 's bones , m'lady , what 's ado ? " she said then , her smile as warming as her applewood fire . " Is't some trouble at Paul 's ? " she added , and her smile faded , for her husband Guy , and Jack Maudelyn too , had gone to see the trial . Katherine explained quickly and Dame Emma shook her head . " There 'll be cracked pates and brasted bones if no worse , the City 's been heaving like a pot o ' porridge these past months . This 'll boil it over . I pray me goodman keeps his wits , though I 've scant hope o ' Hawise 's jack  --  sore as a bear on a chain  --  is jack . " Katherine did not answer ; she twisted her hands together and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sipped the sage brew , she wandered about the cheerful low-ceilingedroom , presently she sat down by Dame Emma and despite the good dame 's protests helped her with the cracking and picking out of hazelnuts . Dame Emma thought how those white soft handsp345had once been rough and red with chilblains , and of the frightened fifteen-year-old bride who had so touched her heart and Hawise 's . " Lady Katherine , how does my wench ? " she asked suddenly . " Does she serve you well ? " " Oh , Dame Emma , I can not tell you how well ! She 's my sister , my friend  --  indeed I  --  I  --  " Her eyes , though shadowed by worry , shone with wistful gratitude . The goodwife patted the slender wool-clad shoulder and thought that she understood why Hawise so loved this fair woman , though Hawise 's father did not . Egged on by Jack , Guy himself had taken to grumbling lately , to saying that Hawise had better come back to her family and leave the shameful service of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he used to be by the salary and benefitsHawise received , since he himself was prospering . Yet even Guy must grudgingly admit they could not do for the ten-year-old Jackie what Katherine 's influence had . The lad was gone for a page in a Kentish knight 's home , and a chestful of clothes with him that would not disgrace an earl 's son . Katherine threw down the cracker and pick amongst the tray of rattling nuts and wandering to the window peered out again . " Robin 's coming , he 's past Saint Magnus ' church ! " She opened the door and flew out to the street . They came back in together and Katherine cried to Dame Emma , " All 's well with the Duke ! Thanks be to God and His Holy Mother  --  Tell  --  tell what happened , Robin . " The young squire laughed and picking up some hazel meats crunched them in his strong teeth . " When I got back , His Grace and Lord Percy had already left the church with Wyclif . I talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all a rare good joke . With the turmoil and the shouting , and a score of bishops darting here and there , the folk got confused ; and then the rood screen tumbled down and frightened them so they rushed back into the nave . " " And then ? " cried Katherine . " Why then the Duke and my lord Percy simply walked out through the Dean 's door , mounted and rode off towards Cornhill , where they are to sup with Sir John d'Ypres . Percy 's squire said my lords were cool as spring water and very tickled at the breakdown of the trial . " " There 's a-many wo n't be , " said Dame Emma , frowning . " God 's nails , ' tsounds a disgraceful brawling all around . " Yes , it is so , Katherine thought bitterly . She sank down on a little three-legged stool within the hearth and rested her forehead on herp346cold hand . She closed her eyes and saw John as he had stood beneath the amber light of Paul 's great window , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had never been less godlike . Hot temper he had always had and arrogance , but not like this . She thought of the furious shoutings and the clash of a sword next to Blanche 's quiet tomb . The fire leaped up , and in its flames Katherine saw far different pictures of him . She saw the gentleness of his face as it had been at Les Landes when they first came together in love ; she saw the tender laughing way he had played with their babies when he had last come to Kenilworth . But aside from these personal things , she thought of how he had so often shown a true compassion . Of a happening in Leicester town three years ago , when they crossed the street at Southgate , and an old crazed man had darted out from the gate 's shadow . In snatching at the ruby brooch that clasped the Duke 's mantle , he had gouged John 's cheek open with filthy fingernails . The wretch was one of the Duke 's own serfs , and yet John had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guards would have seized him , and taken the old man to a room in Leicester Castle , there to be tended and sheltered until he died at last while blessing the Duke 's name . Yet there now seemed in John nothing but hatred . The squire and Dame Emma looked at the brooding , desolate figure on the stool within the hearth . Firelight shimmered on the burnished head , on the lovely lines of the brow and straight nose and round cleft chin , and they glanced at each other . Robin yearned to kiss the little hand that plaited and unplaited a fold of the gray skirt , to implore her to smile . The goodwife 's impulse was more practical . " Sir Squire , " she said , " since me men folk 're out , do ye go down cellar t ' far corner behind a keg o ' malmsey . Ye must move the keg to reach a stone crock o ' peach brandywine I put down last Lammas . Fetch the crock an yell be so kind , ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made off into the courtyard , bound for the passage that led to the cellars , Dame Emma reached up to a shelf and taking down her two engraved silver cups began to polish them ; for she never served her famed liquor in ordinary mugs . Dame Emma had but dipped her cloth into the powdered pumice when she heard the pound of running feet outside , and a banging on the door . In the excited shouts she recognized Jack Maudelyn 's voice.  |p347Dame  Emma jumped up and yanked the settle around so that it hid Katherine . " Stay there , " she whispered , and pulled the bolt . Her son-in-law shot in . " Out of me way , old mother , " he cried , dancing with impatience . " I want me headpiece and bow and quiver , Master Guy too , get down his pike and sword . " He flung open the door to the passage where the Pessoner weapons were kept , began to pull them feverishly off the wall pegs . " Not so hot , not so hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . " What 's all this coil ? Where 's Master Guy ? " " He 's coming . " He shook her off as he grabbed a handful of arrows from his quiver , " Where 's longshot ? Where 's me best goosetippedshaft ? The devil take it  --  who 's been meddling here !  --  and this pike 's dull as wood  --  no matter , ' twill serve  --  " He thrust his sandy shockhead into the helmet , slung the quiver over his shoulder . " Serve for what , jack Maudelyn ? " cried Dame Emma in a great voice . " Why , to pierce the Duke 's black heart , if God gi ' me that honor ! " He was fumbling with the leather lacings of his headpiece and did not hear Katherine 's gasp from behind the settle , but Dame Emma ran to the hearth as though to mend the fire . She held her finger to her lips and shook her head violently . Katherine had started up but she sank back onto the stool . The dame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'ye mean by that wicked speech , ye rascallion ! " Jack seized his longbow , shouldered his pike and cried exultantly , " I mean that John o ' Gaunt and that whoreson Percy 'll never see another sunrise ! Men o ' London 're roused at last ! They 've gone off to Percy 's now  --  then we 're on to the Savoy after Lancaster ! " " Jack , Jack ! " cried Dame Emma starting back , " ye couldna do this fearful thing an ye would , the Duke 's own guards  --  " Jack broke in contemptuously . " The Duke 's own guards 'll not stand against two thousand men ! Hush your blab , old ' oman , I 'm off , tell Master Guy to hurry after  --  " He dashed through the kitchen and the slam of the front door shook the house . Katherine stood up . Her face had gone pale as the plaster wall . " Call Robin , quick ! " The dame obeyed . The squire had been tugging at the malmsey keg but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into the kitchen.  |p348Katherine  stood in the center of the rush-strewn flags , her looks so white and strange that Robin cried out in alarm . She shook her head impatiently to still him and spoke with tense restraint . " Listen  --  a mob two thousand strong is after the Duke . They would kill him  --  but they think him at the Savoy . You know wherehe is ? " Robin gaped , but the control with which she spoke conveyed urgency quicker than if she had shouted . " At Sir John d'Ypres ' in Cornhill , " he whispered . " But Lady , how know you this  --  " " No matter . Hurry , Robin , warn him  --  my God  --  " Her voice rose suddenly . " But where can he go  --  tell him west out of the city  --  " " He would not run from a rabble , lady , " Robin , breathing fast , had now caught the full impact of her news . " Not our Duke , and with this reckless spirit he has shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the force of her desperate concentration . " Then tell him little Richard is in danger too , that he must get across the river to Kennington and protect the boy . Make him go ! " Robin turned with his hand on the latch , when Dame Emma ran up with a paring knife , " Best take this off , " she cried and slicing the stitches , yanked the Duke 's badge from Robin 's shoulder . The squire grunted and dashed out . While the door was opened both women heard the distant roars of the mob . " They must be at Ludgate , " whispered Dame Emma . " Christ 's blood , but they'vegone mad  --  and you too Guy le Pessoner ! " she shouted , for her t ' Y husband came lumbering along the street , his moon face purple , his paunch heaving beneath his guildsman 's tunic . " No , you do n't , " she cried pushing him down on the settle , as he started for the armory passage . " Yell not go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms akimbo and eyes snapping like sparks , glared down at her panting husband . " Ye big fool , what 's got into ye  --  out roistering and murdering  --  " She grabbed the poker and brandished it in her husband 's face . " Emma , forbear , " stammered the fishmonger . " Ye do n't know what they 're doing to us . They aim to make us serfs here , to take London 's liberties . They 've a bill at Westminster ready now , to put that stinking marshal over us . Already he 's ta'en a prisoner he 'd no right to , had ' im mewed up in a dungeon . We freed the knave and burned the stocks they 'd put him in . We searched for Percy  --  " " And did ye find him ? Nay , stay there , " Dame Emma thrust thep349poker at her lord 's belly and he sank back on the settle . " Not yet  --  he 'll be at the Savoy wi ' t' other traitor  --  Peter  --  who 's this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing like a church statue beyond his angry wife . Katherine walked forward around Dame Emma , and looked down at the ' fishmonger . " What has the Duke of Lancaster ever done to you , Master Guy , that you should requite him like this ? " she said . The fishmonger dropped his eyes . " What does Lady Swynford here ? " he muttered , twisting his leather-shod feet beneath the settle . " Fled here for shelter from ruffians like you , " cried Dame Emma . " Would ye deny it to her  --  " Master Guy swallowed , he waggled his head distractedly . At length he said , " Nay , " and sighed . " Ye can put the poker down , Emma . Me blood 's cooling . But wrong 's been done us  --  great wrong . Would ye have us take these wrongs like gelded conies ? " He reached to the hearth for a flagon of ale and his wife , putting down the poker , brought him a cup . He drank , then looked at Katherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter thoughts of you , many a time , but now I 've room for pity . Me blood 's cooled down to be sure  --  but out there  --  I doubt they 'll be slaked until they 've slain your  --  " The word he would have used was paramour , yet there was something in Katherine 's face which checked him . " Until they 've got Lancaster , " he finished looking down into his cup . Katherine shuddered , yet still she spoke with biting calm . " They 'll not get him , Master Guy . For they say God is just , and will know that the Duke has suffered wrongs as much as you have . " " Brave words , my dear , " said the fishmonger . " At least in this world he has you to speak for him . " " And cares not  --  " she whispered , turning away.  |p350KATHERINE  SLEPT that night of the riots at the fishmonger 's . After a few hours of exhaustion , she awoke with a jump of panic when St. Magnus ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received kindly by the Pessoners , who told her the latest tidings . Little harm had been done after all , yestereve . The Duke and Percy both had somehow escaped , said Master Guy , and here Emma made a private signal to Katherine , for she had not disclosed Katherine'spart in warning the Duke . It seemed that Bishop Courtenay himself had finally appeared and berated the mob leaders , saying that they had carried their disorders too far and that he was ashamed of his flock . So one by one they had slunk off to their homes , contenting themselves with reversing the Duke 's coat of arms wherever it hung outside a shop and then pelting the blazons with mud and excrement . " And I 'm glad enough now , no harm came to the Duke , " said Guy , donning his leather apron which was plastered with fish scales , " ' T was a good night 's work as ' t is , in especial that we let loose the wrongfully held prisoner from Percy 's inn . The marshal 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that ? " asked Dame Emma , coaxingly pushing a dish of fried eggs towards the silent Katherine . " Some fellow from Norwich . I didna see him . ' T was said he was in mortal fear o ' the Duke . Th ' instant he was freed , he hared it off for sanctuary in Saint Paul 's . " Dame Emma sighed . " And think ye , chucklehead , that this is the end o ' London 's trouble ? Can ye get it through your numb skull that violence but breeds violence ? D'ye think the Duke will smile and thank ye for this night 's work ? " The fishmonger thrust his lip out and said stubbornly , " He should not a tampered wi ' our liberties , he should not a set hisself against the commons . " The goodwife sighed again . " Ay , commons 've no friend at court these days . " She bustled over to pat Katherine 's shoulder . " Ye do n't eat , my lady ? " ,  | " No , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I must get to the Savoy . God be thanked the Lady Philippa and Hawise seem to 've suffered no harm . I had forgot them last night . " Ay , poor lass , you forgot all else but one man 's danger , Emma thought as she said , " Ye canna go alone . Go wi ' her , Guy , she 'll be safe wi ' you . " The fishmonger grumbled that a load of herring awaited him at the wharf , that his prentices must be chivvied to work , that there was a mess of cod to be delivered to the Guildhall , but finally he took off his apron and mounted Katherine behind him on his great bay gelding . He was a goodhearted man , and he admired Katherine 's fair face , but he was increasingly convinced that Hawise 's devotion to this woman was unfortunate , even dangerous . The mortal hatred aimed at the Duke might well glance off and hit those near him , as indeedit already had ; and though no coward , Guy did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected on his own connection with the Duke through that of his obstinate daughter . He rode along in gloomy silence until they had crossed the Fleet bridge , then he said , " How long d'ye look to be down here , m'lady ? " For he thought that since Hawise could not legally be forced to break her service indenture to Lady Swynford , and would not if she could , at least the farther away they went , the better . " Not long , " said Katherine with a cold vehemence that astonished the fishmonger . " I shall see to that , Master Guy . " " To Kenilworth , then , or Leicester ? " " No , " she said , " to Lincolnshire , to my own home . " " By Saints Simon and Jude ! " Guy twisted his fat neck around to stare at her . " Will the Duke allow it ? Are ye not contracted to him as governess to his little ladies , as well as by other  --  other ties ? " " I believe the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff and straight on the pillion . " And by the Blessed Virgin , I am no serf , to be bound against my will ! " " Welladay ! " cried Guy , thinking that the riot had very properly frightened her into caution . " ' T is a sensible plan . " Katherine did not answer . The gelding jogged along the Strand past St. Clement 's little church . Katherine had passed the church fifty times without special notice ; today as she glanced at it , eleven years slid away . She saw in the porch a priest and a knight with crinkled hair , and a girl with a wreath of garden flowers on her head . Handfasted , they stood , the girl and the knight , while the priest intoned , " To have and to holdp352from this day forward to love . . . and to cherish . . . till death .... " She turned away from the church and stared down the Strand ahead , until they came to the Savoy , then Master Guy started and cried , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine looked up at the gatehouse . They had wrenched off the Duke 's great five-foot painted shield and hammered it back again upside down . " ' T is what they do to traitors ! " said Master Guy and chuckled suddenly . " Them leopards look mortal silly astanding on their little heads awaving of their little legs . " His chuckles grew into a rumble . " For the love of Christ  --  stop it ! " Katherine cried , shaking his arm . " Ca n't you see what you 're doing to him ? What man could stand the vile lies  --  the hatred  --  you know he 's not a traitor . Oh God curse the lot of you ! " She jumped down off the horse . The fishmonger 's jaw dropped . He stared after her while she was challenged by two men-at-arms who barred the way with crossed spears , then he saw her pass and disappear into the Outer Ward . He shrugged his thick shoulders and rode slowly back to town . That afternoon , unable to come to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was chilly , the clipped yew hedges and the shrouded rosebushes were drenched in gray mist , but she had flung a warm squirrel-lined cloak over the gray woolsey . Nor would she have felt the cold in any case , while she paced the deserted brick paths and thought of her new-found decision . She would leave here tomorrow . She and Hawise and the Kenilworthservants who had come down with them would return there at once . She would pick up her children and hasten to Lincolnshire  --  to Kettlethorpe . John might be momentarily annoyed at her taking their two babies from the luxury of Kenilworth , but since they obviously no longer interested him any more than she did herself , his protest would be a formality . He should have no cause to reproach her for negligence in her duties to Philippa and Elizabeth either . Until he should appoint a new governess , Lady Dacre here at the Savoy would be delighted to wait upon Philippa  --  and delighted to get rid of me , Katherine thought . Well she knew that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Secure in his love and protectionshe had always ignored these slights . Now this was changed . Back and forth she walked between the frosty yews and thoughtp353harsh practical thoughts . She would keep the wardships and annuityhe had already given her if he allowed her to , for she owed it to his children , that Kettlethorpe might be made habitable for them . But she needed nothing more . She would be invulnerable again and alone , with this ' wicked unwanted love walled out of her heart . Suddenly she looked down at the ring he had put on her finger in the ruined chapel in the Pyrenees . Betrothal ring . She stared at the round translucent sapphire , the stone of constancy . Her lips tightened as she twisted the ring from her finger and walked to the riverbank . She stood on the marble pier and holding the ring outstretched in her hand , gazed down at the black lapping waters . " Nay  --  I can not , " she said , after a moment , turning from the river . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her arms , Swynford boars impaling the Catherine wheels ; the blazon he had made for her . Am I then nothing of myself ? she thought with anguish . Can I not live apart from memories of him  --  She sank down on a stone bench , and stared out across the river to the barren stony hummocks of Lambethmoor . The mists grew thicker and downstream the pale lemon light faded over London . One by one from its churches the bells rang out for vespers , near at hand the Savoy chapel gave forth its sprinkle of silvery chimes . She stirred restlessly on the bench . The bells ' familiar summons disturbed her . Since Sunday she had not been to Mass , nor partaken of the Blessed Sacrament in weeks , for it no longer gave her comfort ; things of the spirit had grown as empty and cold as her love must grow . The bells drowned out the sound of approaching oars on the river until a barge appeared out of the mists quite near the pier . Katherine started for the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice called out , " My Lady Swynford , is it you ? " She turned and recognized Robin 's feathered cap and rusty tunic as the squire waved from the barge 's prow . She came down the steps and waited while the oarsmen steered up to the pier . " So you 've returned , " she said quietly . " Your errand last night , Robin , was well done , I 've heard . " The youth jumped to the pier and cried , " I 've been sent for you , my lady , to come to Kennington . You 're to come back with me at once ! " " No  --  " said Katherine , unsmiling . In the shadow of her hood her face gleamed hard as pearl , her eyes were cooler than the mists.  |p354Robin  was dismayed that the lovely laughing girl who had been his most precious charge was transformed into a stern woman with a stranger 's eyes . He stammered , " But my lady  --  ' t is a command  --  you are summoned to Kennington Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " You may tell him that I know , he has never been lacking in courtesy when he thinks there 's cause for it , but in sending you to warn him I did nothing that his lowliest varlet would not have done . " Robin blinked , and looking down at the toe of his leather shoe , said unhappily , " It is not His Grace who summons you . " The bells ceased their ringing and there was silence on the pier . " Who does then ? " said Katherine . " The Princess Joan , my lady  --  she commands in the name of Prince Richard that you shall come at once . " " Whyfor ? " said Katherine , in a less sure tone . " I 've never met the Princess , what could she want of me ? Robin , is His Grace not at Kennington too ? " " Ay  --  he was  --  locked into a chamber with Percy , I believe . I 've not seen him since we crossed the river last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Princess was most anxious . " Since there was now no queen in England , Princess Joan was sovereign lady and must be obeyed . Katherine reluctantly let Robin help her into the waiting barge . The oarsmen bent their backs and pulling sturdily against the current moved their craft upstream . They passed Westminster and crossing to the Lambeth bank landed at the Kennington pier . They went up a terraced path to the fair small country palace where the Prince of Wales had died . Robin led the way through a courtyard and upstairs to the Princess Joan 's bower , where a waiting woman admitted Katherine at once , then left her alone . The room was gaudy as a jewel box ; the walls hung with painted silks , the floor covered with bright woven flowers in a Persian carpet . The furniture was gilded , and in a gold cage studded with crystals two white birds twittered . As Katherine looked at the birds the Princess entered hurriedly , in a rush of pink velvet and a wave of heavy scent , crying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been awaiting you ! " She held out a fat dimpled hand so loaded with diamonds that Katherine , as she curtsied , could scarce find space to kiss . " I have come , madam , as you commanded , " said Katherine distantly , and rising , she waited.  | " Take off your mantle and sit down , my dear , " said the Princess , while she settled her billowing hips into a canopied chair . Katherine obeyed , wondering what was wanted of her , and her pride hardened still further , for she thought that she could guess . The Princess was like a large blowzy rose . Katherine noted the dyed hair , the excessive plumpness of the rouged cheeks , the charcoal blackening the scanty lashes , and thought how the nuns at Sheppey Convent had admired this fair maid of Kent , and of how she had once heard a knight say that when Joan had married the Prince of Wales she was " la plus belle femme d'Angleterre  --  et la plus amou-reuse . " Perhaps his brother thought so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " My dear , you 're not at all as I expected . I see now why  --  yes  --  I 'm glad I summoned you . " The girl looked highborn and well-bred , Joan thought in surprise , most lovely features . The firm cleft chin showed character too . She was relieved at this new view of Lancaster 's mistress , for gossip had it that the little Swynford was an upstart strumpet , and some said that she kept him from his Duchess by the use of black arts . Joan smiled , the gay confiding smile which had won many a heart , and said , " I have something to ask of you , Lady Swynford  --  ' t is a delicate matter . " " Perhaps I may save you embarrassment , madam , by telling you that I intend to leave the Duke 's service tomorrow , and shall go to live permanently in my own manor in Lincolnshire , " said Katherine . " Is that far enough away ? " The Princess 's eyes grew round as turquoise disks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you think I asked you here to beg you to give up the Duke ? Great heaven , child , it is quite the opposite ! " ' What ! " cried Katherine sharply . " Madam , you are jesting . " For the Princess was laughing in small muffled spurts . " Nay , listen , " said Joan wiping her eyes on her pink velvet sleeve . " Forgive me , I do n't know whether I laugh or weep , for I am frightened  --  frightened  --  do n't stare at me with those great angry eyes  --  my dear , I need your help . " The Princess rose and walking to Katherine cupped the girl 's chin in her hand and gazed down earnestly . " Do you really love my brother of Lancaster ? " Katherine looked away , and her color rose . " Ay , I see you do . " " He loves me no longer , " said Katherine very low . " He 's had no thought of me in months  --  there are many signs  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the carved mantel absently traced the pattern of acanthus leaves with her finger . " I believe you 're wrong , " she said , " and for two reasons . I lived fifteen years with his brother and in many ways they are like as two cockleshells . Edward never ceased to love me and come back to me , and yet when the dark violent fits were on him  --  " She shook her head . Her hand dropped from the mantel and she sat down again . " And the other reason is this . Three weeks ago we held a Christmas mumming here for my Richard . John came , of course , with many others to do Richard honor , and late that night when we had all retired I could not sleep for missing my own dear lord and fearing for the future of my little son . Then I heard a strange noise in the State Chamber which is next to mine , and where John slept . It was a sound of outcry and struggle . I opened the door between and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I knew that he was in the grip of some frightful dream . He choked and panted and cried out your name . Katrine ! Katrine ! ' He cried it with a frenzy that would wring your heart . I went to him and woke him , and he was angry with me and bade me get out . We did not speak of it again . " The hardness in Katherine 's breast dissolved a little , and she said with a faint smile , " ' T is something to know that he yet thinks of me in dreams . But what is it you would have me do , madam ? " The Princess , gripping her chair arms violently , cried , " Go to him ! Go to him  --  and somehow , make him listen  --  make him stop these dreadful things he 's planning  --  Christ 's mercy ! I think he has gone mad ! " The girl got up and ran to kneel by the weeping Princess . " Dear lady , he is not mad , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , never has he told me his plans . " The Princess , gripping the chair arms violently , cried , " Go to him ! Sir Simon Burley  --  Richard 's guardian  --  pled . I even summoned the old archbishop here , John would not see him , do you know what he means to do ? " She shuddered , and her tear-blurred eyes grew fixed . " He means to muster an army , his own people and Percy 's from the north , he means to march it onto London ! Civil war ! Worse far than what my dear lord dreaded . There 'll be no England left for Richard . " Katherine sank back upon the carpet . Her heart beat heavily and her thoughts ran together in confusion . " And this gathering of an army is not all , " cried the Princess . " Hep357proposes this night to violate sanctuary  --  to seize some prisoner who has fled to Saint Paul 's  --  to drag him out from the altar  --  hang him . " " Jesu , no ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her the worst of all that the Princess had said . The right of sanctuary was God 's most sacred law and to violate it meant damnation . " Ay , " said the Princess with a groan . " Every man 's hand would be against him then . John will be killed . He was saved last night , Katherine , but after this nothing could save him . As surely as his grandfather was murdered in Berkeley Castle , so will John be killed and thousands of others with him . " " This prisoner , " cried Katherine , " who is he ? " In the blackness of her confusion , there was a glimmering . An intuition . " Some knave who did write placards about the Duke , so Percy said . " The Princess spoke with weary impatience . She thought this a foolish question indeed when the welfare of her son and England was at stake . But Katherine 's intuition grew stronger . In some way the prisoner held the key to John 's unreason . All these things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he read the placard at St. Paul 's . Of a sudden her prideful hurt and anger vanished , and her love flowed back on a wave of pity , while she felt in her own breast a vibration from the wild submerged pain he had been suffering . She saw that the Princess Joan was right , and that she alone had love enough for him to wrestle with his demon . The bower door opened and a child walked in , a lad with curling flaxen hair and a face so delicate that but for his parti-colored hose and royal blazoned surcote he might have been a girl . " Dickon ! " cried the Princess holding out her hand . " Come to me , love . Here , Lady Swynford , " she said as the child stood by her knee , " is England 's hope . " She looked at Katherine with pleading , praying that the girl 's hesitation would be finally resolved by the sight of this fair royal child . Katherine started from her thoughts and curtsied . Richard bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mama , my lord Uncle John is leaving  --  he 's on the stairs  --  I thought you did n't wish him to go  --  " " Dear God ! " cried the Princess jumping up , " he must not go . If he leaves here  --  Katherine  --  can you stop him  --  for I know that I cannot. "  | " Perhaps , " whispered the girl . She shut her eyes . Her mind formed no prayer , she importuned no saints nor even the Blessed Virgin for help , and yet it seemed that some new calm strength came to her . The Princess rushed to the door . They went out together and down the newel stairs to the courtyard . The Duke , in brass helmet and full armor , his hand resting on his sword , stood by the river gate shouting last instructions to Percy : " Then by dawn we 'll have raised a thousand men between us , ' twill do for now . The Savoy  --  " He stopped and stared , as Katherine came up to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his new plans that at first it seemed he did not know her . Beneath his lifted visor his face was set and haggard , his eyes the sharp ice-blue she had always feared . She looked at him softly , but she spoke with the force that had come to her . " My lord , I must see you alone now . " " Katrine ! " he said bewildered . " What do you here ? You were at the Savoy  --  nay , in Billingsgate  --  I remember Robin Beyvill said you sent him . ' T was not well done , they were in no danger here at Kennington . I would have faced them down in London , they 'd not have dared to touch me . " " My dearest lord , " said Katherine , looking steadily up into his face , " I wish to see you alone . " " What tiresome folly ! " He jerked his mailed hand on his sword hilt . " I 'm off to the Savoy . My men are gathering , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drawn off frowning , the Princess and the boy stood watching by the palace door , while along the edges of the court the grooms and retainers were peering openly , wondering at this lady who dared delay the Duke . Katherine drew herself high , her chin lifted and she said inflexibly , " All this will wait until you 've talked with me . I command it , my lord . " " Command ! " " Yes , " she said unflinching . " By reason of this you gave me . " From her purse she drew the sapphire ring and held it out to him on her palm . " And this is the first thing I have ever asked of you , my lord . " He looked at the ring , and then at Katherine . He turned impatiently to Percy . " You go on ahead . I 'll follow shortly . Now Katrine , what do you wish of me ? "  |p359The  Princess saw that the first battle had been won and came forward hastily . " There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can talk to Lady Swynford there . I 'll send food and drink to you , for you 've not eaten all this day  --  " She saw his face darken , and added with the desperate guile she had often needed for her Edward , " Supper will give you more strength and a clearer head for whateverit is you plan to do tonight . " John frowned , but he walked over to the stairs without comment . The women followed , while the Princess pulled Katherine a little behind . " God help you , child , " she whispered , " and Saint Venus help you too . You 'll have need of every help to turn him from his purpose . Make him drink much  --  and  --  by Peter , I wish there were time to dress you in one of my silk chamber gowns , though ' twould n't fit  --  no matter , you must know the ways to make him think of love . Woo him , cajole him , weep  --  " " Dear madam , " whispered Katherine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you nor me , nor England , she thought , but because he is destroyinghis own soul . She entered the State Chamber and the Duke turned sharply on her . " What would you say to me , Katrine  --  I 've little time . " " Time enough to rest a bit though , my lord . And I ca n't talk to a man standing in full armor , ' t is frightening . " She gave him a gay coaxingsmile , though her heart beat fast . He grunted and sat down on the wide oak chair where his brother had used to sit . She went to him and quickly unhooked the latchet of his brass helmet and lifted it off his head . " And you ca n't eat in these , " she said , unbuckling the straps that fastened his mailed gauntlets . " Here comes Robin with wine  --  wo n't you let him take off the rest of your armor ? ' Twill be quickly donned again when you wish to leave . " The young squire had entered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Princess 's cellars ; a server followed bearing a silver platter loaded with eel jellies , white bread rolls and a steaming oyster pie . She gestured to Robin , for still John did not speak . He was fighting a great weariness that had come on him when he sat down . He had not slept in two nights , the first at Percy 's Inn , the second here . His head swam , and because it blunted his purpose , he fought off too the realization of how strongly he had responded to Katherine 's touch as she drew off his helmet . He suffered Robin to unbuckle the other sections of his armor and hang them with his great sword from gilded wall pegs where thep360Prince of Wales ' black tilting gear still hung . Then he took the cup of wine that Katherine brought him and drank quickly . As he had hoped , it cleared his head . " What are you doing at Kennington ? " he said scowling . " Why did n't you wait at the Savoy to see me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone and she was preparing a plate of food . She had never lied to him , nor would she , but she knew that she must choose all her words with care . " It is not always so easy to see you at the Savoy , my lord , " she said pulling a corner of the table over so that he might eat in comfort , " nor for me to see you at all  --  of late . " She smiled , with no hint of reproach , and sat down close to him on a stool . " You look very tired , wo n't you eat , please ? Alas that ' t is only Lenten fare , but these oysters are well roasted . " He started to protest hotly , to say that if she had forced him to delay his start simply to babble of oysters , he would be gone this instant , but instead , and to his astonishment , he said a very different thing . " Why do n't you wear the ring I gave you , Katrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they left the courtyard . She was startled too , but she answered evenly , " Because I thought that it had lost its meaning . " A quick dull flush mounted his thin cheeks . " Nay , how could you think that , lovedy ! " The little pet name he had so often called her slipped out as unawares as had his question , yet he felt aggrievement . Whether he saw her or not , he had known her ever there in the background  --  waiting , like his jeweled Order of the Garter , seldom worn , yet the possession of this most special badge of knighthood was of steady importance to his life . " I have had matters to think of , " he said roughly , " but these matters had nothing to do with women . " " Yes , " she said , filling his cup , " I believe that now , my lord . " She brushed against his shoulder as she put the flagon back on the table , and he smelled the warm fragrance of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip around her waist and pull her closer to him , but she moved away before he touched her and sat down again . His arm dropped . He drank , and spooned up the oysters , eating fast , for he found that he was famished and this the first food in weeks that had had savor for him . While he ate , he felt another new factor , a quality of rest and lessening of strain . He resented the thought that this easing came somehow from Katherine , who sat beside him quietly , gazing into the fire . He had forgotten too how beautiful she was , nor did he wish to think of it now.  |p361He  picked up the gold-handled table knife and cut himself a slice from the bread loaf , while pulling his mind back towards his purpose . They were massing at the Savoy , men-at-arms from his near-by castles at Hertford and Hatfield . They 'd be there by now since he had sent messengers off at dawn , and the King 's guard from Sheen too . It would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England , but already he had sufficient fighters to back the first move that he would make . Pieter Neumann  --  He threw down the bread and his fingers gripped the hilt of the knife . This time he would kill Pieter with his own hand  --  no mercy . Yet as he thought this , a spasm of nausea gripped his stomach , and his throat seemed to thicken and close . It had not been so this morning when a messenger brought the news that Pieter had been freed by the London mob , and had fled to sanctuary in the cathedral . Then his rage had been so violent that he had lost all control for a time , he had been shaking and shouting with fury , and he had seen alarm in the faces of those around him , Joan and Sir Simon  --  even Percy , who was angry enough himself at the outrages . Katherine had turned to look at him as he threw down the bread and gripped the knife and she forced a long steady breath to master her dismay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skin had turned the color of mold , he swallowed hard and painfully , and in his eyes as they stared at the knife the pupils had swollen so that there was no blue . Katherine felt a shock of recognition . Somewhere there had been a child who looked like that , an uncomprehending terrified child . She searched hard for the memory , and when it came it seemed to her so incongruous that she rejected it . The reminder was of her little John . Last summer he had wandered into the cow-byre at Kenilworth , and a playful calf had galloped at him , knocking him down . The child had believed the calf to be a werewolf , fitting it someway into a horrible tale a serving maid had told him . Katherine had reasoned with her boy , had made him pet the calf , and got him to laugh at his terror , yet a month afterward the child had had a nightmare from which he awoke to scream that the calf was after him with the slobbering fangs and blood-red eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he trembled and grew white . It were folly indeed to make a comparison between the thirty-sixyear-oldDuke of Lancaster and a four-year-old child , and yet  --  in both she had seen the same intrinsic shape of fear.  |p362The  Duke stirred and put down the knife , he wiped his lips on the damask napkin . " I  --  I must go , " he said in a voice that wavered . He stood up and glanced towards his armor . Katherine rose too , and took his hand in hers . " Why must you go , John ? " She looked up solemnly into his resistant face . " Is it to kill the man who is in sanctuary at Saint Paul 's ? Is it to do sacrilegious murder , that you must go ? " He snatched his hand from hers . " How do you know that ! And if it were , what right have you to question me ! Katrine , you 've never before  --  get out of my way ! " For she had backed up so that she barred the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray eyes fixed on him with compassion , but her tone was cool and searching as when she rebuked her children . " Of what , my dear lord , are you so afraid ? " He gasped , and raised his hand as though to strike her . " No , dear , " she said . " To hit me 'll do no good . All these last months have you not been striking out , and has it eased you ? You know that it has n't . I believe that to speak out might ease you . I love you , John , trust me . " He listened , looking at her and then away . " No man or wornan has ever thought me a coward , " he whispered . " And now you , who say you love me  --  " " Holy Christ , my dearest , you 're no coward . I know well how you lead your men in battle , and how you 've risked your life a times , and yet there is something that you fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders sagged , and he said in a listless voice . " Witchcraft  --  witchcraft - The man must die this night , for he has cast on me a monstrous spell . " He made the sign of the cross and turning , walked to the cushioned banquette beneath the window , sat down and rested his head in his hands . Katherine too crossed herself , but without conviction . There were sorceries and devilish spells , of course , and yet she did not believe that here they were the answer . She went to John and sat beside him on the banquette . " Who is this man that you fear ? " she said gently . " Not him , I do n't fear him , the sniveling crippled little shavepate  --  " he muttered , nor seemed aware that he contradicted what he had just said . " What then ? " she persisted , " What is it that so troubles you ? " " Katrine , for God 's sweet sake ! Why must you naggle at me ? You know what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reverse my shields , they lie and slander , they doubt my  --  my honor ! "  | " Ay  --  " she said hesitating , for almost she sensed the something deeper than this , something that she began to think he did not see himself . " They 've done terrible things to you , but it is because they are afraid ; and you have made them so . Do n't you see this , my lord ? " He did not answer . She saw his brown hands clench and unclench , and then the fingers fall lax . She watched his hands which she had always loved . The palms were square and calloused from much handling of the lance and sword , but the fingers were long and sensitive as those of Hankyn , his chief minstrel , whose soul was filled ' with poetry , and John 's touch at times could be tender as a woman 's . She saw now that these hands were trembling , and she ached to put her arms around him , to kiss and comfort him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would push away in anger , as surely as Tom or little John struggled in manful pride against ill-timed caresses , and she spoke again in a clear sorrowful voice . " You are the strongest , the most powerful man in England , my dear lord , so can you not be merciful ? " His head twisted around and he looked at her strangely . " Isolda said that ! When we vowed in the chapel . But she did not keep her vow . Blessed Virgin , he 's drunk , she thought , trying to check her terror that this might be worse than drunkenness . " Isolda ? " she questioned as steadily as she could . " Isolda Neumann  --  my foster mother , " And having said it , he sighed and added in a tone of wonder , " In all these years I 've never spoken her name . " He reached over for the flagon and his crystal cup , poured until the rich golden wine splashed on the table and drank . Katherine was amazed . She guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was this of his milk-nurse , and vows in a chapel , and ' why had he never spoken the woman 's name ? She dared not question too much , fearful of rupturing this quieter mood . The courtyard clock had struck eleven long ago , though he had not heard it . It was black night out , and if he would but stay until the wine took full effect , she might yet persuade him to the rest he so badly needed . She glanced frowning at the State Bed , where the Prince had died  --  still hung with gloomy sable mourning velvet  --  when John spoke again . " The man you asked me of , the one I shall kill , is Pieter Neumann , who was Isolda 's son . " " Ah , " Katherine breathed , still more startled and trying to un- derstand this revelation . She ventured on what seemed at first sight to be likely . " And he injured his mother in some way ? And you , loving her very much perhaps , have not forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded too weak , too pat . Yet John said , " Yes , " with a peculiar quickness . " Yes , that was it . " He had glanced off from the truth , she knew . What was it the Princess had said of the man in sanctuary ? " Some knave that wrote placards about the Duke . " The placard on Paul 's door  --  the ridiculouschangeling slander . He stood up suddenly , swayed and caught at the table . " Late , " he said thickly , " must go . Do n't like your eyes  --  Ka  --  Katrine  --  gray eyes that lie  --  break vows  --  she said she 'd never leave me but she did  --  she vowed something else  --  else  --  vowed Pieter had lied  --  " He rolled his head back and forth as though to rid it of a weight , and stumbled a few steps . Katherine ran to him and flung her arms around him . " Here , dear love , you must rest . " He stumbled again and by wedging her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He fell prone onto the black coverlet amongst the embroidered argent ostrich feathers . Katherine had never seen John dead drunk , for his tastes were temperate , but she had had much experience with Hugh , and she thought now that either he would be very sick or sink at once into a snoring stupor . But she was wrong . As she brought a candle to the bedstead and herself climbed up beside him , pulling her furred cape over them both , he rolled over onto his back , and he began to speak in thick disconnected sentences . She leaned over him and listened while her heart pounded with her desperate effort to understand what he would tell her . At first she thought he did not know that she was there and that these were only drunken ramblings , but his eyes opened , and he looked at her with recognition , though his speech was so slow and heavy that she could scarcely follow the words . Vows in the Chapel of St. George at Windsor , broken vows . He said it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling ? " Katherine whispered at last , " how did she betray you ? " and thought she should not have spoken for he grew silent , and turned his head away , gazing vaguely at the black folds of the bed curtains . But after a while he spoke . " She went away that night , though she vowed she 'd never leave me . She died , " he added in a fainter voice . " She died of plague . "  |p365Katherine  waited tensely . This was no moment for reason , for saying that Isolda could not help her death . " She lied in that  --  " said John . Suddenly he struggled up onto his elbow and staring into Katherine 's white face he said with a remote and terrible quietness , " So perhaps she lied when she denied what Pieter said at Windsor . " " What Pieter said  --  " repeated Katherine . " What Pieter said ? " " Changeling , " he muttered . His lips drew away from his teeth and he fell back on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesu  --  now I see  --  " She twisted up onto her knees and crouching over him she cried , " And you believed it then , that you were naught but a butcher 's son ? Part of you believes it now ! It is for this that you must prove to England  --  to yourself  --  John , look at me ! " She took him by the shoulders and shook him . " Wake up and listen ! It 's the foolish frightened child in you that believes this . As your son believes that a playful calf is a werewolf ! " He gazed up bewildered at her gray eyes shining in the candlelight . They were desperate in her desire to reach him . The fog cleared a little in his mind . " Isolda told you the truth ! " she cried . " Oh John  --  you who are most like the King of all his sons , so like that men say you are twin to what he was when young . How could you doubt your birth ? " He moistened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know that I doubted it  --  until tonight . " His hand moved gropingly and caught a fold of her skirt , and his eyes closed . She stretched herself beside him and took his head against her breast . He did not know it , though he moved as though seeking the position in which they had so often lain together . His breaths grew quiet and even . The Duke slept nearly the clock around , and for many hours withoutstirring . When the palace bells rang for morning Mass , there was a knock on the door of the State Chamber . Katherine , slipping her arm carefullyfrom beneath John 's head , hurried from the bed . She opened the door and held her finger to her lips . The Princess stood in the passage round-eyed and anxious . " Is all well ? " she whispered , noting Katherine 's dishevelment : the gray gown twisted and wrinkled , the great coils of bronze hair that had tumbledon her shoulders , the white tiredness of the girl 's drawn face.  |p366Katherine  stepped out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said gravely . " He sleeps . " " God be thanked , " said the Princess . She carried her gold beads on her wrist for she was on the way to Mass , and she kissed the crucifix . " Poor lass , " she said , touching Katherine 's hand . Her plump rosebud mouth quivered with sympathy , for she remembered the exhaustingviolence of Plantagenet love-making . " Come to my bower . A sage femme in Bordeaux gave me a philter , ' twill restore you  --  " She bent closer and whispered . " Nay , " said Katherine smiling faintly . " ' T was not that , madam . He has been carrying a strange and torturing burden . Please God , ' t is lightened . " She put her hand on the door . " I must stay near him lest he wakes . " The Princess , enfolding Katherine in a smother of soft scented flesh , kissed her impulsively . " Ah my dear , if you have by any means brought him out of these fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " She went down the passage towards the chapel thinking that all the rumors she had heard about John 's leman were false , and that it was a sorry shame that Katherine could not have been born Queen of Castile instead of that cold dark foreigner at Hertford Castle . All that day , while the outer world hummed and messages went back and forth to the Savoy , Katherine stayed in the State Chamber watching over John as he slept . Robin brought food and drink to the door , and she took a little . Sometimes she rested , far on the outer edge of the bed so as not to disturb him . And she thought long and hard about this secret thing that had so deeply troubled him . She saw on what twofold foundation the whole structure of his early life had been built : Isolda 's love and the sacred privilege of royal birth . And that when to the child 's view these two had dropped away from under him together , a part of him had shattered as truly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was strong and tough as had been his father , and most of the royal Norman line ; while from his mother he had staunch Flemish common sense . So time had passed and he had built his world up again , and forgotten this shock that had so frightened him once  --  until the placard brought it back , hideously grown because now the whole of England witnessed it . Since then this buried dread had gripped him and he had fought back as a child does with blind fury . And yet because he was not a child but a man , composed by now of as many colors and shapes as a painted glass window , there had been deep-seated struggle in his soul . For he was merciful , by nature , neverp367had he killed senselessly or maimed even in war , as his brothers had done , and of all Edward 's sons he was the most sensitive . Katherine thought this and much else throughout the long day . She thought of the fearful power of a lie , of all evil  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had believed herself capable of guiding their lives rightfully , of easily salving their hurts , and that by providing for their mind and body nurture she had fended off all . Now she was uncertain , and dismayed . Little John 's misconception about the calf was minor enough , and would pass in time ; but what ' other concealed demons might not be preying on a child ? And with a painful twisting at the heart she saw Blanchette 's stricken eyes as she had looked up from her embroidery the last day at Kenilworth . It was useless to deny that her firstborn and dearest child had lost her old happy confidence and was drawing away into some bitter jealous little climate of her own . But what can I do ? Katherine thought despairingly . She glanced towards John as he lay sleeping still . Her love for him had grown tenfold since he had trusted her last night with a glimpse of his naked soul . Yet yesterday she had been swamped with a resentful pride , even with the hatred that seemed welded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What then was certain ? What was there that would not shift and veer at the mercy of the winds of feeling ? Sanctity , the clergy said . Prayer . The practice of religion . The benevolence of the holy saints . The Grace of God . Katherine rose and walked to the Prince of Wales ' prie-dieu in the corner beyond the armor . A gilt , elaborately enameled triptych hung above the prayer desk . The center panel depicted Calvary , the side ones showed various tortures of the damned . These were intricately detailed : naked bodies writhed in orange flames , and from severed limbs and seared eyes dripped ruby gouts of blood . The Christ 's face on the Cross expressed only contorted agony and above the panels was written , " Repent Ye ! " She gazed at the triptych with repulsion . Here was no message of steadfastness . Here naught but warning and more fear . Her rebelliongrew , and she wondered , What guidance do we truly get from the saints or even from the Blessed Mother and Her Son ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lord from harm ? What of the vow she herself had made to St. Catherine in the storm at sea ? Had the saint in truth really saved her ? And this vow she now felt had h-ad nothing to do with heavenly guidance . Thep368necessity of faithfulness to Hugh , however bitter , had sprung from her own self-esteem , her own integrity . For I believe , thought Katherine , there is nothing beyond or above ourselves . At once  --  and for an instant she was frightened  --  she heard plain in her head how Brother William would cry " Heresy ! " in his stern tired voice . Then she forgot her painful questions and ran to the bedside , for John stirred and said , " Katrine ? " " My lord , " she whispered , bending over him . His eyes were clear as the sky of Aquitaine , and the smile he gave was one she had not seen in long . He reached his arms up and pulling her down kissed her hard on the mouth . Then he sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep I 've had  --  " He looked at the curtainedwindow . " Is't dark still ? " " Again ! " she answered smiling . " You 've slept the day through . " " By the rood ! And did I then ? " He scooped his hair back from his forehead and stretched prodigiously . He ran his tongue around his mouth and said , " Dry as tinder . It seems that I was drunk last night  --  it seems to me too that I babbled much nonsense . " He quirked his brows and looked at her half laughing . " You do n't remember ? " she said softly . " Nay  --  only that you were near me , and most patient . And that I love you , sweet heart . " He pinched her cheek and grinned at her . " I shall prove it soon  --  but not in this gloomy bed . Lord , what a dismal room . We must get back to the Savoy . " He got up and walked into the garderobe . She heard him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Send for food , lovedy , " he called to her , " I 'm famished . " She picked up the hand bell and rang it . There was a pause before it was answered , for the page , who stood ever ready in the passage , had been given orders . When the door opened , it was the Princess who came in , and with her was her chief advisor , Sir Simon Burley , a grave-eyed conscientious man whose grizzled beard waggled anxiously as he said , " The Duke 's awake ? " Katherine nodded and gestured towards the garderobe . John walked out , his face and neck still aglow from the vigorous sluicing he had given them . " Good evening , Joan , " he said to his sister-in-law . " Did you think you had old Morpheus himself for guest ? " He turned to Burley , " And you , Sir Simon , I see by that long face that there 's more ill news . Ca n't it wait until I 'm fed ? " " My lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lon/cloners have gone off to Sheen , to the King 's Grace to beg him to reconcile your quarrel with the City . They know your troops are massing at the Savoy . The people are affrighted . " " And so they should be , " said John with calm sternness , " And shall make just reparation . " The Princess and Burley glanced at each other , both remembering the terrible rage of yesterday , the threats of war , of violation to St. Paul 's , of murdering revenge . " What is just reparation , my lord ? " said the Princess nervously . " By corpus ' bones , Joan ! I 'll decide that when I 've got to Sheen and heard what they offer . Certain it is our poor father wo n't know what to do  --  My sweet sister , have your cooks all been drowned in the Thames ? Or shall I roast a leg of yonder chair myself over the fire ? " The Princess laughed and called orders to the hovering page . " My lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with relief , " you sound yourself again . Your sleep did great good . " Impatience , arroganceand sternness he showed as always , but she saw that the wild consuming unreason had left him , and she sent Katherine a look of deepest gratitude . NEITHER KATHERINE nor the Duke ever mentioned the night at Kennington Palace , though it had an immediate effect on their relationship . His need for her deepened , he talked to her more freely about all his concerns , and he kept her with him constantly , showing her many public as well as private signs of his love . Katherine bore herself with discretion , but all those of the Duke 's meinie , and soon many others outside , grew aware of her new status . At the Savoy , her lodging was changed from the Monmouth Wing ,  |p370nor  was she put in the small room near the Privy Suite which she had occupied on earlier visits . She was given the Duchess 's small solar adjacent to the State Chamber , while her nights were spent with John in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Table in the Hall her seat was shifted to one next the Duke , and though decorumwas observed by the vacancy of the Duchess 's place to his right , it pleased John to order made for Katherine a chair no less magnificent than his own , with gilt carvings , topaz velvet cushions , and her embossedCatherine wheels for a headrest . These elevations naturally set many spiteful tongues to wagging , but they wagged in secret , not only for fear of the Duke , but because the Princess Joan made plain her tolerance of the situation and treated Lady Swynford with marked favor . To the Duke 's close friends , such as Michael de la Pole , the Princessdid not hesitate to attribute the Duke 's new restraint to Katherine'sinfluence . This de la Pole inwardly doubted , but he smiled and made some vague remark about the softening power of fair womanhood . Still whatever the cause , the baron was pleased to see that his lord had reverted to his normal temperament and handled the aftermath of the riots with justice . The Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to their apologies and extenuations , had exacted mild enough punishment : a public penitential procession to St. Paul 's in which the City dignitaries should carry a candle painted with his coat of arms , and had ordered that the unnamed instigators of the disturbance should be excommunicated . When these orders had been grudgingly obeyed , he saw to it that the obnoxious parliamentarybill to curtail the City 's liberties was quietly dropped . When the people demanded a fair trial for Peter de la Mare , who was still imprisoned in Nottingham , this was granted . In the course of some weeks the Speaker of the Commons was released and rode in triumph back to London . Against William of Wykeham the Duke 's hostility lasted longer , since he was not adverse to making an example of the bishop as a lesson to the episcopal party . Upon finding the Duke implacable , Bishop Wykeham bethought him of another method to regain his rich temporalities , and by the promise of a colossal bribe to Alice Perrers , convinced that lady , and through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . King Edward duly signed a bill for Wykeham 's restitution . John when he heard this was displeased , but he shrugged and letp371the matter rest . This happened in June when the King was obviously failing and there was a great deal else to be thought of besides the chastisement of one fat bishop . Katherine was interested to hear of these various clement measures and gradually began to understand something of the conflicting ambitionsand turbulence which made difficult any clearcut policy . But in the matter of Pieter Neumann 's fate she felt vivid personal concern . And on this one topic , John would not speak to her . She saw that the hidden wound , though purged of its prurience and healing rapidly , yet would always leave a sensitive scar , and she forboreany mention of Pieter , though she ached to know what had been done with him . She found out at last in Eastertide , on Maundy Thursday after the foot-washing ceremony . On this Thursday the act of humility in imitation of the Blessed Christ was performed throughout the Christian world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savoy the line of beggers began to form in the Outer Ward directly after Mass . It was customary to number the poor by the age of the lord who would humble himself to them , but the Duke magnificently augmented his own thirty-seven years by the ages of his three Lancastrianchildren , thus making forty additional ragged and filthy candidatesto be honored . The ceremony took place in the Great Hall and Katherine stood watching at one side of the dais where the paupers , looking both proud and frightened , were seated on benches , and tittered nervously as the great Duke of Lancaster commenced the washing of their dirty scabrous feet . The Duke was dressed in a humble russet tunic devoid of ornament . Two squires held silver basins of warmed rose water , and Robin held a towel . The Duke smiled gravely at his paupers and worked quickly and conscientiously . He made the sign of the cross on each foot , then kissed the toes , while murmuring the words of humilityUpon dismissal the owners of the feet went on to material rewards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meats and bread , from which the paupers were permitted to fill large sacks , and at the door the Duke 's almoner doled out pieces of maundy silver . It was a solemn ceremony , but Katherine had trouble keeping her face straight as she watched the ducal children perform their ablutions on their own forty of London 's poor . Elizabeth had been brought down from Kenilworth for Easter , and was wild with excitement at her release from the country butp372she had protested hotly at this penance . " I wo n't do it ! " she cried angrily to Katherine . " Their feet stink and their fleas and lice come jumping out all over me ! " Elizabeth had not , however , actually dared to flout the yearly custom , but her performance of it was scarcely penitential . She held her nose with one hand while she made a hasty dab at an outstretched foot with the other , and she had finished all of her paupers before Philippa had thoroughly washed and dried one pair of feet . Philippa alone truly seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl 's exalted face . Pity it was she could not follow her obvious vocation . But at least the marriage offer from Luxemburg had been refused , so she had been happy lately . Katherine turned to watch the Duke 's son do the ablutions . Little Henry imitated his father as closely as a stocky ten-year-old boy could imitate the graceful motions of a tall lithe man . Henry dipped the towel in water , rubbed , crossed and kissed with a good deal of the Duke 's imperturbable dignity . But he would never have his father 's debonair charm . When the ceremony was concluded and the gratified paupers had begun to gabble and bicker amongst themselves , the Duke came to Katherine and said , " Shall we visit the mew , sweet heart ? ' Twill smell far better than in here , and we must see how your little merlin does . " Katherine assented gladly . Falconry had become a passion with her , and she was as eager as the Duke for her merlin to be trained , so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Duke 's head falconer , met them at the door of the mew with a finger to his lips , and the sad tidings that Oriana had some puzzling ailment . The great white northern falcon had drooped upon her perch for days , she had refused gobbets of raw meat , and even tiny newborn rabbits with which Arnold tempted her . The falconer glanced back into the darkened mew where fifty hawks of all degrees set up a restless fluttering and tinkling of their silver leg bells . " They be tittuppy , " said Arnold anxiously , " hearing voices . Your merlin does well , m'lady , " he added to Katherine . " She now flies boldly to the lure , but Oriana  --  " He turned back to the Duke shaking his head . John , instantly concerned  --  for his royal gerfalcon had no peer in England , and aside from his affection for her , was worth nearly two hundred marks  --  had framed a question as to her medication , when he was interrupted by Brother William Appleton . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Outer Ward and on seeing the Duke standing at the door of the mew , dismounted and walked over . " My lord , " he said gravely , gazing at the Duke from beneath his pointed black cowl , " it is done . The ship sailed from Pevensey on Monday . " He glanced coldly at Katherine . She saw John draw a long shaking breath while he said very low , " Chained in the galleys ? " " Even so , my lord . He 'll not trouble you again . " " And the Benedictine monks ? " " Have been stringently disciplined by their prior . " John sighed once more , and into his eyes there came a vague look , as though he listened to an echo . " Good , " he said at length . " You 've done well , and I thank you . " He clapped his hands together once , then let them drop , and turning to Katherine said , " Wait here , lovedy . I must see Oriana , but ' twill disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mew with Arnold , and the Gray Friar made as though to leave , but Katherine cried out , " Brother William , I beg you ! " The friar paused and examined her . She wore a new gown of emerald brocade so lavishly furred with ermine that it befitted royal rank , and the gold fillet that bound her hair was jeweled and scalloped like a noble 's coronet . " Lady Mede , " he thought angrily . " Pride be painted here and pomp of the world . " It was Alice Perrers that Long Will satirized in his " Piers Ploughman " as Mede , the corrupt courtesan- Yet here was another such , and worse , by reason of the crime which had exalted her . " What do you wish , Lady Swynford ? " he said with fierce emphasis on her surname . She felt in his gaze some deeper meaning than the abhorrence of an ascetic friar for the sin of unhallowed love . He ' frightened her , but she persisted urgently . " This man of whom you spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galleys , is it Pieter Neumann ? I 've a right to know  --  " she added sharply , as his lips tightened , " for my dear lord 's sake . Ay , I know you think me worthless and lewd , but by the Holy Blood at Hales , my love for him has not harmed him , it may even be that it has helped him at times . " She ended on a note of quivering hurt . The friar , opening his mouth to cry that no good could come from evil , and that she was a fool to think her love had caused no harm , yet did not speak . The candid innocence of her eyes restrained him ,  |p374and  he felt that there was still some good beneath this wicked flauntingbeauty . After a moment he said curtly , " It was Pieter Neumann , deported on a ship bound for Cyprus where he 'll remain in exile  --  if he survives the voyage . " " But he was in sanctuary  --  " " And stayed there the allotted forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this matter than he had supposed . " All was done with due regard for the laws of sanctuary . I myself was present at his hearing , and have just seen that the sentence of banishmentwas duly executed . " " Bishop Courtenay did n't try to save him ? " she asked quickly . " No  --  " said the friar startled . " Courtenay 's now ashamed of his tool , and rightly so . " " Did the Duke not see Pieter ? " The friar hesitated , but again he answered her . " No  --  I believe he did not trust himself . " " God in his mercy be thanked , " said Katherine . " My dear lord is then truly and honestly rid of his fardel . " She spoke with simple fervor and more to herself than the friar , but Brother William was softened . He bent close and spoke in a tone he had not used to her since the night of Hugh 's death . " My child , " he said earnestly , " rouse yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength ! " " Rouse myself ? " Her mobile face hardened and she stepped back from the friar . " Give up the Duke  --  and this unclean love of yours ! Uncleaner than you know  --  " His sunken eyes blazed a warning , then he checked himself . " Ay , to you all earthly love 's unclean , " she said bitterly . " You threaten me with hell , I suppose . It may be so  --  but I do n't believe it . I have come , " she said looking at him defiantly , " to believeonly in my self , and my love . " He shook his head and looked at her with sadness . " You speak foolishly , Lady Swynford . Disaster will come to teach you better . Nor do I mean hell fire  --  but in this life  --  disaster ! " he repeated on a sharper note and suddenly he clutched his crucifix . He stared down at the paving stones , his face half hidden by his cowl . As happened sometimes during his strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , dreams so vivid that almost , in his pride , he had thought them holy visions . But the dream last night must have come from Satan , so full of senseless horror had it been ,  |p375of  glaring bearded faces gibbering , of the smell of smoke , and blood . When he had said " disaster " now , he remembered that he had seen Katherine 's tearful tender face bending over him in his dream ; and that she and he had been linked together in fear . " Christe eleison , " he whispered , much disturbed by the memory of this dream and the foreboding that had come with it , disturbed too that he should have dreamed of Katherine , for it was long since the devil had injected a woman 's face into his sleep . " Benedicite , " he muttered , abruptly , and walked rapidly away towards the chapel . Katherine waited by the mew for the Duke to come out and the discomfort Brother William had aroused in her soon melted in the warm spring sunshine . Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violets and the yellow celandine had rooted in scanty pockets of earth between the stones , and she touched the little flowers as she passed . Through the water gate she could sce an arch-shaped bit of the Thames glinting sapphire beneath the warm blue of the sky where rooks cawed and wheeled towards their nests in the elms across the river . She walked down to the landing and breathed softly . The air smelt of new-turned earth and the budding greenwood . With the slapping of oars , sounds more melodious than the rooks floated to Katherine from a wherry filled with young folk . A shockhairedlad in scarlet jerkin tootled on his pipe while the others caroled merrily , Oh Lenten is come wi ' love to town  --  sing hi ! sing hey ! Wi ' blossom and wi ' birdies ' rune  --  sing hi ! ho ! hey ! They drifted out of earshot , but Katherine , smiling , gazed after them . When the Duke , having finished inspecting Oriana , walked up behind her on the pier she had a lapful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river to watch the little purple specks go bobbing away over the ripples while she sang in her sweet warm voice , " Oh Lenten is come wi ' love to town , sing hi ! sing hey ! " He laughed and kissed the top of her bent head . " Moppet , " he said , " you 've forgotten your weight of years and many children ? " Katherine giggled and rising from the step saw that no one watched except the old bargemaster . She flung her arms around John 's neck and kissed him heartily . " Many children , my lord , but not yet a full bevy , " she whispered against his ear.  |p376The  Duke looked startled as he took her meaning . " Is it so , my Katrine ? " His eyes darkened and he looked down at her anxiously . " You are n't pleased ? " she asked while her smile faded . " Ay , I shall welcome it . You know that . But you were very ill last time , lovedy  --  two nights I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the altar rail . " " Ah , dear heart  --  " she whispered turning her cheek against his shoulder , for she had not known of that . When Hawise had finally nursed her through the childbed fever into full conciousness again , he had been gone from Kenilworth and on his way to Bruges to negotiate the truce  --  with Costanza . " Nay , but all will go well  --  this time , " she said quickly . " I 'm a fruitful woman and shall bear you another brawny son . " She could not forbear the little note of triumph , for the scale dipped heavy on the other side and she could hear voices sniggering , " What , again a Beaufort bastard ! Surely shame itself must blush by now ! " John , too , thought of Costanza and with a glacial repugnance which must be controlled . During Lent he had had no need to visit her at Hertford , nor would she have received him since she observed the penitential season in strict solitude . But she had sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her pilgrimage to Canterbury had resulted in a cure . No doubt Costanza again had hopes that she might bear an heir for Castile . He looked down at the lovely curved cheek that rested trustfully against his russet-clad shoulder , and taking her hand he said in a harsh voice , " Thank God , Katrine you wear my betrothal ring again . " He started to tell her of the pain he felt for her and all that he would do in recompense ; of his Nottinghamshire manors that he would give her and a necklet of rare Eastern pearls a Lombard goldsmithhad sent word of to the palace . But she stopped him . " Nay , darling , I know . You need n't fret yourself like that . See , it 's for this I had you engrave , the raison on my brooch . " She touched it , " It is as it is . " " Cold comfort , " he said roughly beneath his breath . He drew her tight against him and they stood silent on the pier watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his palace of Sheen at Richmond , the old King died at last . He was in the sixty-fifth year of his life and the fifty-first of his reign , and most of his subjects felt that both had lasted too long . The glories of Crecy and Poitiers were far in thep377past , and many now thought that those victories were negated by the interminable warfare that succeeded them and was not yet ended . The very week of the King 's death the French were harrying the coast of Sussex . Yet even those who despised the King for his insensate lust to rule France at whatever cost to England , and for his extravagance and blind follies , were shocked by his end . The King was alone with Alice Perrers when he was stricken with an apoplexy . She had been sitting on his bed , casting dice with him , , and provoking him to delighted titters by the outrageous stakes she demanded  --  the Archbishop of Canterbury 's miter , the province of Gascony , the crown regalia  --  when the King gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His staring eyes swam with red , one lip drew up in a snarl , as half of his face was turned to stone . Alice screamed and jumped off the bed . The King fell back on the pillows . He gave forth great snoring gasps as she watched him , horrified . She saw that he must die and that her long power was at an cud . She bent quickly and pulled three richly jeweled rings from off his flaccid fingers . She thrust the rings in her bodice and backed off trembling , then she turned and fled from the chamber , pausing only to shout at a page that he must get a priest . She ran from the palace to the river , had herself ferried over , and by bribing an innkeeper on the western bank secured a horse and set out for safety to a nook in Bedfordshire where a certain knight owed her return for many favors . The old King died soon and alone , except for a friar that the frightenedpage had found . His sons and little Richard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach Sheen for some hours . England mourned courteously for the King , the people wore sad clothes , black cloth shrouded their windows , and Requiem Masses were said throughout the land . Edward 's funeral procession and burial ticxt to Queen Philippa on the Confessor 's mound in Westminster Abbey were conducted with doleful pomp . The dirge-ale was drunk to the accompaniment of decorous sighs . But everywhere eyes turned with hope and rejoicing to the fair charming boy who would be crowned on the sixteenth of July . It was useless for wry-faced oldsters to grumble that unlucky was the land ruled by a child : a chorus of rebuttal drowned them out . Richard of Bordeaux was their own . They had loved his father , and Joan of Kent was as English as the hawthorn . Angers faded . The bishops checked their fulminations against Wyclifand the Duke of Lancaster , the Lollard preachers turned theirp378sermons from the injustices done to the poor and spoke on Isaiah 's text , " A little child shall lead them . " The great nobles ceased their jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prodigious sum upon their share of the coronation festivities . On the Feast of St. Swithin , July 15 , the day before the ceremony in Westminster , Richard 's procession from the Tower through the City surpassed in magnificence any civic celebration ever seen . Katherine viewed the procession from a tier of wooden benches which had been erected on West Chepe for the accommodation of privileged ladies . The Princess Joan sat on a dais , flanked by two of her sisters-in-law , Isabella of Castile , Edmund 's frivolous and emptyheadedwife , who was as unlike her sister Costanza as a chaffinch to a raven , and Eleanor de Bohun , the great heiress , Thomas of Woodstock'sbride . Eleanor was a high-nosed girl with a mouth like a haddock , who fussed so loudly over some matter of precedence that Katherinecould hear her acid complaints from where she sat at some distance from the royal ladies , with Philippa , Elizabeth and her own Blanchette . The Swynford children had been brought down from Kenilworth for this extraordinary occasion , and her little Tom by special favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession amongst the nobly born boys of approximately Richard 's own age . St. Swithin , doubtless propitiated by countless prayers , had in the morning duly cleared some threatening rain clouds from the sky , and the afternoon was as dazzling as the white silk banners and the cloth of silver draperies that were festooned along the line of march . On the Chepe the great open conduit , new-painted in blue and gold , gurgled pleasantly near the grandstand , and the heat grew such that Katherine sent a page over with a flagon to be filled . The conduit , for the three hours of the procession , ran with wine . Good wine , and even young Philippa drank thirstily before resuming her sedate cornposure . Elizabeth fidgeted and yawned as detachment after detachment of the commons walked past by City wards , all garbed in white in honor of the child king . Blanchette sat quietly beside her mother . Her wondering eyes moved from the marching men to a gold-painted canvas tower where four gold-costumed little girls of her own age were perched in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung over the flimsy parapets . The commoners had all disappeared down Pater Noster lane and the men of esquire 's rank were filing past when Blanchette leaned forward and said , " Th  --  there 's Uncle Ge  --  Geoffrey , " with the littlep379stammer in her speech which had developed during Katherine 's last absence from Kenilworth . " So it is , darling ! " her mother answered staring at the rotund figure in the white linen over-robe that made him look comically like a Cistercian monk . She had not seen Geoffrey in months , for he had been again in France on King 's business . As his file of esquires passed the ladies ' stand , he looked up and waved at them , then peered quickly along the benches looking , no doubt , for his wife . But Philippa Chaucer was not there . The Duchess of Lancaster would attend the coronation tomorrow and was even now en route from Hertford with her ladies , including Philippa , but a secular parade did not appeal to her . The knights and knights ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new mayor  --  the wealthy grocer , Nicholas Brembre . He complacently curbed his prancing horse with as much negligent skill as any knight , while he bowed to the stand where his lady mayoress Idonia was ensconced on silver cushions at a place of honor near the Princess Joan . " He looks almost a gentleman , except he 's so greasy and sweaty , " said Elizabeth of the mayor in a shrill astonished voice . " Hush , Bess , " said Katherine sharply . " Gentlemen sweat too , in heat like this . " " Not my father 's grace , " retorted Elizabeth pointing proudly . " He 's never slobbery , no matter what . " Katherine bit her lips against a laugh , for Elizabeth was quite right . The lesser earls and barons had passed by and Richard 's uncles , led by the Duke , had appeared at the curve by Chepe Cross . In cream velvet trimmed with silver and riding on a snow-white horse , John gleamed as immaculate as an archangel . His brothers , the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine like a couple of nondescript rustics by comparison . She had no opportunity to admire John as she wished nor to respondproperly to the bow he sent in their direction , for as the little King approached in a blare of herald 's trumpets and the rattle of drums , the ladies surged to their feet amidst cheers and roars of " Long live Richard ! " The small girls in the canvas castle were prodded from below and in a sudden frenzy began to fling out gold florins and tinsel leaves across the King 's path . Someone hidden in the tower pulled a string so that a canvas angel with jerking arm brandished a crown over Richard 's passing head . The boy looked up , startled , and laughed , a high fluting tinklep380audible even through the tumult of his acclaim . The ten-year-old Richard was pink and white and delicate as an appleblossom . His thistledown curls were yellow like a new-hatched chick . His shoulders seemed too slight for the vast white and brilliantstuddedmantle they had draped on him , albeit he sat his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knighthood when the beast lagged . " By corpus , he looks like a maiden , " cried the irrepressible Elizabeth , examining her cousin critically . " I trust he 'll cease to be such a mollycoddle , now he 's King ! " She had scant use for Richard , who was poor at games , liked only to mess about with little paint pots or to read , and clung to his mother 's skirts when teased . " Tomorrow he will be God 's anointed , " said Philippa severely , frowning at her sister . " You must not speak like that of the King 's Grace . " Elizabeth subsided , faintly awed , so that Katherine could give her whole attention to the group of lads that followed Richard on foot . She singled Tom out first and showed him to Blanchette , aware that the child had drawn back and ceased to look at the procession as the Duke rode by . " Look , sweet , " she said taking her daughter 's hand , " how bravely our Tom marches with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like Hugh , she thought with a pang . The dusty-lookingcrinkled cap of hair , the square Saxon face , the forthright stride  --  these were all from Hugh , so was the boarhead-crested dagger that dangled on his hip . The Duke had given him a far handsomer dagger , but Tom obstinately preferred his father 's . " He 's m  --  much t  --  taller than L  --  lord Henry , though he 's younger , " said Blanchette . Katherine squeezed the passive little hand and agreed , but she sighed . Blanchette 's pride in her brother was natural enough , yet this remark , like nearly everything Blanchette said , showed her animosity to the Duke and all who belonged to him . Well , she would have to get over it , thought Katherine with sudden impatience . The two Hollands came cantering up at the tail of the procession , waving their great swords and crying to the people to stand back and wait until the King had passed the cathedral before they rushed to the wine fountains . These two young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and , beloved as Joan was , no one felt that they did her much credit , except apparently Elizabeth , who had recovered from Philippa 's reproof and pointing at the younger Holland , John , said , " There 's a comely lusty-looking man ! ' T is Jock Holland . He picked up my glove when I dropped it t' other day at Westminster.  |p381Nan  Quilter , " she added admiringly , " says he has more paramours than any other man in London . " " Elizabeth , you 're disgusting ! " cried Philippa . " Must she forever tattle servants ' gossip , Lady Katherine ? You must find some way to refine her tastes . " Before Katherine could speak , Elizabeth tossed her dark curls and said , " In truth , ' t is not my lady here should chide me that I speak of paramours . " Katherine felt herself go crimson and heard a little gasp from Blanchette . " This is not the moment to discuss your rudeness , Elizabeth , " Katherine said mastering her voice with difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions may be , your father 's grace has put you in my charge . " Elizabeth flounced , but she looked down and began to twiddle with a loosened pearl on her bodice . Philippa put her hand on Katherine 's knee , shook her head and said gently , " I ask pardon for my sister . " Her pale eyes rested on Katherine with sorrowful affection . " God 's blood , what a fuss about naught ! " cried Elizabeth , suddenly giggling . " I meant nothing . " She looked up through her lashes at Katherine . " ' T is too joyous a day for long faces , " she said coaxingly . " Oh , my dear lady  --  please  --  may n't we buy some of those comfits ? " Elizabeth 's giddy eye had caught sight of a sweets vendor who was pushing through the crowd . Katherine silently drew some silver from her purse and gave it to the page , who darted after the vendor . Elizabeth had been insolent certainly , yet bitter it was for Katherine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple truth . But what of Blanchette ? Could she at ten know the meaning of " paramour " ? Or had she gasped only because she saw that in some way Elizabeth was attacking her mother ? Katherine looked down with an aching tenderness at the little head with its silken crop of flaming curls and was dismayed to see that the round chin was trembling . " Here , darling , " said Katherine brightly , taking a sweet from the plate the page proffered , " you love marchpane . Look  --  ' t is made like a perfect little crown in honor of the day . " " I c  --  ca n't , Mamma  --  " said Blanchette shrinking . " I feel sick . " She clapped her hand over her mouth . Katherine jumped up and putting her arm around the child rushed her down off the stand to a street gutter.  |p382Poor  lamb , thought Katherine , holding the clammy little forehead . It was the heat and excitement . Hawise must make a wormwood physic for her when they got back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet the child and sing her to sleep . Even the Duke 's influence was not sufficient to procure for Katherinea good view of the actual coronation ceremonies in the Abbey . As High Seneschal of England he had been ruling on hereditdry claims and matters of precedence for days , and therefore honor demandedthat he show no favoritism . Katherine was accordingly jammed into a section halfway down the nave amongst other wives ; I and widows of obscure knights . Her pregnancy was not yet obvious when she hid her slightly thickened waist under a green silk mantle as she had today , but hours of standing or kneeling were an ordeal , and she would have begged off from attending the ceremony , except that the Duke wished her to be there , had wanted her to share with him , no matter how imperfectly , in this tremendously moving occasion . But there was another reason besides her condition which had made her reluctant . At the margin of the sanctuary dais , on a gilt carved and velvet throne as splendid as the Princess Joan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of her claim to the kingdom of Castile , a small lion-headed scepter . The Duchess had duly arrived at the Savoy last night , Katherine having retired some days past to the Monmouth Wing with her children . John had spent the night at ' Westminster Palace with Richard so that Katherine had not had the anguish of the thought of him with Costanza . A humiliating anguish which she each time believed to be conquered . She knew that there was no love between them and that whatever union they had resulted from a sense of duty . And yet  --  Today in her coronation robes , a sparkle of jeweled crimson and ermine , the Duchess was a handsome woman . At this distance , anyway , she seemed imbued with a dark slender majesty that dominated the other royal wives , and even the Princess , who appeared to be an enormous mound of periwinkle blue surmounted by an orange blob of hair . Katherine closed her eyes and leaned her aching back against a pillar . Outside to the sound of trumpets and tabors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north door of the Abbey along a carpet of striped red worsted . The Duke carriedp383the great blunted sword of mercy , Curtana , and behind him , his enemy , the Earl of March , whose baby son was Richard 's heir , carried the sword of state . The bitterness between March and the Duke was abeyant just now , like other enmities , and John had gone out of his way to conciliate the nervous , spiteful little earl . The Earl of Warwickfollowed with the third sword ; Edmund of Langley and Thomas of Woodstock carried the orb and scepter . Over Richard 's bare head , the barons of the Cinque Ports , by ancientright , upheld a cloth-of-gold baldequin supported by four silver poles . After them came old Sudbury , the Archbishop of Canterbury , 1 us wrinkled face working with emotion , his blue veined hands tremblingon his crozier  --  and after him the bishops and the abbots and priors and monks . As they entered the Abbey and Richard was placed on a platform halfway between the choir and the High Altar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firmetur Manus Tua . " Katherine 's eyes filled , the people around her wept as the glorious singing mingled with the exultant organ and the Abbey was awash with beauty of sound , enclosed by the beauty of stone . She could see very little of what took place , but in the suddenly - tense , quiet church she heard a quavering boy 's voice repeat the coronation oath and when the archbishop turned to the people and asked if they would have and hold Prince Richard for their King , she cried joyously with the thousand other voices , " Ay , we will have him ! " while her spine tingled . The ceremony progressed : the Veni Creator , the Litany , the Collects . Then the King was anointed with the holy oil and invested with all the ceremonial robes and the regalia . Finally he was crowned and installed upon his throne . The archbishop commenced the EnthronementMass , and first of all Richard 's subjects , the Duke of Lancaster , knelt before the child to do him homage . Katherine could see John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people were kneeling , and she saw that Richard smiled sweetly down at his uncle . " Ah , our little King 's one of the Blessed Virgin 's holy cherubim , " whispered a voice behind Katherine , " and he 'll bring a bit o ' paradise to England  --  and peace , God willing . " Richard 's reign started with bright promise . Only the most superstitiousthought ill-omened two small occurrences . The little boy drooped and had gone very pale when the Mass and homage were at last over and he walked down the transept to quit thep384Abbey . He swayed giddily as he stepped into the North Porch . His old tutor , Sir Simon Burley , was watching . He swooped the child up in his arms and ran with him towards the Hall , where Richard still must endure the banquet . When Burley lifted him , one of the King 's red-velvet consecrated slippers flew off and must have been seized by some knave in the watching crowd , for it was never seen again . So soon had Richard lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Westminster Hall , the child complained that his head ached dreadfully from the weight of the crown . His cousin Henry sat opposite him in his father 's place , since the Duke and other lords were riding their horses up and down the Great Hall , keeping order . " Feel the thing , Henry , " said Richard , pushing at his crown . " ' T is heavier than an iron helm . " Henry curiously reached his stubby little hands across the board to try the crown 's weight , but the Earl of March intervened violently and snatched the crown from Richard . " I will hold it for Your Grace , " said the Earl , " so that you may eat in comfort . " Henry shrugged and returned to his roast peacock , of which he was very fond . This pother about the crown seemed to him silly , and Richard was always whining about something , anyway . Henry wondered if he could get Tom Mowbray off in a corner for a wrestling match pretty soon , and then remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl of Nottingham after the banquet , and make a lot of other new earls too . Lord Percy would turn into Northumberland , Uncle Thomas of Woodstock was finally going to get a title of his own and turn into Buckingham . The old King had n't cared much for his youngest son and had done mighty little for him , not even a title . But small wonder , thought Henry , Uncle Tom 's a mump . Henry chewed his peacock , drank some wine and yawned . This was a frightfully stately banquet , no dogs to play with under the table , and nobody to talk to but Richard , who was half asleep . Out of sheer boredom , Henry counted up the people whom he did n't like . Uncle Thomas and Aunt Eleanor headed the list , both scowly mumps . And Robert de Vere , whom Richard thought perfection . Robert had a nasty mind , and there were other things  --  though Richard was such a baby he did n't understand . That about finished the lists of dislikes , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really feel much about herp385one way or the other , nor that lisping little dolt of a Catalina , for he almost never saw them . This thought naturally brought him to Lady Swynford and her two children of whom he had seen quite a bit lately . Well , he liked them . Blanchette was pretty and no nuisance , Tom Swynford wrestled and tilted better than most boys , and as for Lady Swynford  --  Henry suddenly realized that in a vague sort of way he thought of her as his mother . Then he thankfully forgot this dull pastime . The minstrels and the tumblers had arrived . In a tapestry-hung gallery at the far end of the Great Hall , the Princess Joan ate with the royal ladies and a few selected peeresses . She had soon given up making conversation with the Castilian Duchess , who responded in polite monosyllables while pecking at her food and sipping her wine with what the Princess , who adored eating , considered maddening affectation . Joan was therefore thunderstruck when the Duchess lifted her head and , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweenford , es vero que  --  zat she is wiz child again ? " Joan for all her experience did not know how to take this , and her instinct was to protect Katherine . She answered , " Why  --  I know nothing about it , Duchess . " Though she did . Costanza gave the Princess a shrewd stare from under her thick white lids . Beneath the ermine cape her thin shoulders sketched a shrug . " I do not inquietarme about bees  --  bastardos , " she said , " excepto  --  " She stopped , obviously searching for words , and the Princess , embarrassed but curious , suggested that French might be easier . Costanza 's eyes flashed . It was the perfidious French who had been supporting the usurper Trastamare on the throne . She never spoke French . She continued frigidly , " La Sweenford she make heem  --  el duque  --  soft . He forget  --  Castile ! " And a very good thing too , thought the Princess , who began to get the drift of this , as Costanza 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's little golden head . Joan had no intention of using her new influence to take up the cudgels for Castile . The French depredations in Sussex were quite enough worry . So she ignored Costanza 's real meaning and said with her charming sunny smile , " Oh , I do n't believe the Duke has grown soft , in any way . On the contrary , I think he 's showing great wisdom lately . We mustp386straighten out the tangles in our own land first , do n't you think ? " Costanza understood enough to realize that here was not the ally she had hoped for ; a curious blankness like a mist obscured her brillianteyes . Her lips quivered , and she muttered passionately in Spanish , " Why will not God let me bear a son ? " She clutched at the reliquary on her chest . Poor lady , thought Joan , recognizing anguish of spirit , even though it did not seem to spring from anything as natural as an unloved wife 's jealousy . Joan was not introspective , nor given to moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable love escapade . But it did occur to her that whether Costanza really minded or not , she was being increasingly wronged by this flagrant affair of John 's with Katherine , and that probably the Duchess suffered more than her colossal pride would let her admit . Joan 's facile fondness for Katherine slipped a little . Spurred by her ever-alert watchfulness for Richard 's safety , she viewed John 's liaison with sudden alarm . Look how the old King 's prestige had waned because of Alice Perrers , . how the commons had .4 almost lost reverence for royalty and actually rebelled against the crown . In truth it would be wiser for John to be more discreet in regard to Lady Swynford . Not cast her off , of course , no need for that . He could send her to one of his northern castles , Knaresborough , Pickering , or better yet , to Dunstanburgh on the Scottish border . There people would forget her and he could visit her in secret . Joan decided to take up this matter tactfully in a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coronation , and she had no doubt that John would soon see the wisdom of her advice . She was destined to be completely disappointed.  | IT SNOWED SOFTLY in Leicester on Christmas Day of the year 1380 , and to the hundreds of guests sheltered at the castle and the Abbey of St. Mary-in-the-Meadows , and in other foundations and lodgings throughout town , the pure white drifts were good omen for young Henry of Bolingbroke 's wedding to little Mary de Bohun . Of all the Duke 's country castles since he had abandoned Boling- broke , Kenilworth and Leicester were his favorites , and the latter was the more fitting for the marriage of the Lancastrian heir . The Duchess Blanche had been born here and her father , the noble Duke Henry , was buried here in the beautiful Church of the Newarke which he himself had built to enshrine his most treasured relic , a thorn from Christ 's crown of martyrdom . This joint celebration of Christmastide and a wedding had tuned Leicester to feverish pitch . Each night mummers came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scamper on their hobbyhorsesthrough the Great Hall . And each night a fresh boar 's head was borne in to the feasting and greeted by its own carol , " Caput Apri Defero . " The halls and churches were bowers of holly , bay and evergreens . On every hearth a yule log burned . The kitchens overflowed with mince pasties , lamprey stews and plum porridge . A stream of servers could not keep filled the wassail bowls with their " lamb 's wool " froth of roasted apples . And , this Christmastide was a feast of light and music . Scented yule candles burned all night , while the streets of Leicester were extravagantly lit by torches that cast their rosy flames on the snow . The waits sang " Here We Come a-Wassailing " in the courtyards , the monks chanted " Veni Emmanuel " in the churches , and in the castle gallery the Duke 's minstrels played carols without ceasing . On the night of the wedding there was a riotous banquet in the castle Hall . Katherine 's sides ached from laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool 's costume , ajingle with tiny bells , and wore a tinsel crown on his head to show that he was king and must be obeyed . The Lord of Misrule had been chosen by lot , and happened to be Robin Beyvill , though one soon forgot that , becausep390he was masked . Robin 's nimble brain thought of many a comical jape , and he won laughter even from the frightened little bride when he seized a peacock feather in lieu of sword and solemnly knighted Jupiter , the Duke 's oldest hound . Katherine sat beside the Duke , but the- were not in their usual seats of honor , for those were given to the bride and groom  --  and Richard . The King and many of his meinie , including his beloved Robert de Vere , had come to Leicester for his cousin 's wedding , though not his mother , the Princess Joan . Joan sent polite messages to Katherine occasionally but they had not met since the coronation . To this weddinginvitation Joan had answered that her aching joints and swollen leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine for a while , and then she accepted it , with a certain defiance . The Duke had told her of the Princess 's request that he hide Katherine away in one of the northern castles and of his indignant repudiation of the idea , adding with tenderness , " It seems Joan has forgot what love is , sweet heart , or she could n't suggest such a thing . " In fact , Joan 's intervention had but increased his ardor , and far from hiding Katherine during these three and a half years , he had taken her with him on all his journeys throughout England . The constables of his Yorkshire castles , Pickering , Knaresborough and the gloomy Pontefract , of the High Peak in Derbyshire , of Newcastleunder-Lymeand Tutbury in Staffordshire , as well as of Kenilworth and Leicester , had grown accustomed to receiving Lady Swynford in the Duchess 's place . Nor during that time did these constables ever see the Castilian Duchess . She remained at Hertford in retirement . Rumor said that she was sickly , a little crazed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could not be said of Lady Swynford . There were four Beaufort bastards now , the last , a year-old girl , christened Joan for her father . The Duke appeared to dote on all these babes as wholeheartedlyas though they had been fair-born . The three little Beaufort boys , John , Harry and Thomas squatted now on stools by their parents ' knees , gaping at the antics of their elders , while the Duke caressed the curly yellow head of his namesakeand asked Katherine some laughing question with all the fond domesticity of a contented husband . No one else took much notice of the Duke and Katherine , all eyes were turned on the Lord of Misrule , the bridal couple and the King ;  |p391but  Geoffrey Chaucer watched his sister-in-law with sharp interest . Geoffrey had eaten and drunk a bit too much . He pushed back from the table , unloosed his girdle and the lower buttons of his pearlgraysurcote , which was too tight a fit . He had not worn it since the coronation and felt much easier in his usual semiclerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rood ! , thought Geoffrey , settling back in slightly tipsy contentment , little Katherine had thoroughly tamed that fierce Plantagenetleopard ! It must be nine years that she had enthralled him , and to judge by the Duke 's attitude now , his passion for her was strong as ever . That was a long time for the sweet fire to burn so bright , Geoffrey thought with a touch of envy , yet he had always deemed Katherine an exceptional woman . She had borne six children , she must be about thirty , but her beauty was undimmed , though it had acquired assurance and lost the touching wistfulness . The new quality was not brazenness certainly , Katherine could never be that . Yet there were changes . Her gown was low-cut as that of Edmund 's promiscuous Isabella , and Katherine leaned openly against the Duke 's shoulder as she had never used to do . Still , her gray eyes were clear as crystal , her high white brow smooth as a girl 's and the new-fashioned Bohemian headdress gave to her a look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon above their faces unfortunatelysuggested a horned cow . It was so with his Philippa . Geoffrey glanced sideways at his wife , on whom the wassailing had taken effect : Philippa was breathing hard and staring glassy-eyed at her heaped silver plate as though daring it to accuse her of being drunk . Thanks to Katherine , she was as well gowned as any of the noble ladies , but her horned headdress had slipped over one ear and its blue gauze veil trailed in the sauce . Philippa would be very cross in the morning . Ah well , ' t is Christmas and a wedding too , Geoffrey thought . It was a year of weddings and matchmaking . The Duke , singleheartedin all that he did , having turned his mind to domestic matters , had now married off two of his children in ways most advan-. tageous to their prosperity if not their happiness . However , nobody expected happiness from marriage and least of all the Duke , though he had achieved it once . Even now , though Geoffrey was fat and forty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Duchess Blanche . The Duke had procured for his Henry another great English heiress , such as Blanche had been , but the marriage of these two chil/dren promised no such felicity . Henry was thirteen and his bride twelve . Up there at the High Table , in her glittering finery , one could see the child trembling like a little white leveret . But she would return to her mother 's care tomorrow . The Duke had no intention of prematurely taxing the breeding powers that would eventually produce the next Lancastrian heir , though some less wise fathers threw the children into bed together at any age and accepted whateverconsequences might arise . " She 's an ill-tempered vixen , " asserted Philippa suddenly , enunciatingwith great care . " She 's scowling at me . " " Who ? " asked Geoffrey , looking around and trying not to laugh , for his wife 's dignity was much impaired by the further descent of her headdress . Philippa raised her spoon and pointed at the hawk-nosed Countess of Buckingham . " Her . Bride 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothingly . " ' T is simply that she dislikesthis wedding , scowls at everyone . " Though it was true that Eleanor de Bohun 's angry eyes rested on Philippa 's dishevelment with disgust , her fish mouth was set in continualdisapproval anyway . Thomas of Woodstock 's wife vehemently agreed with her husband , and resented the Duke 's perfidy in snatchingher little sister from the convent where they had sent her to be a nun . Mary 's return to secular life and marriage to Henry reinstated her as co-heiress to the vast Bohun fortune and correspondingly halved Eleanor 's share . Only an uneasy desire to keep an eye on the proceedings , lest worse befall , had brought Eleanor to the wedding at all , and she made no effort to be civil . " She glares at me , " retorted Philippa belligerently , " because she dares not be rude to Katherine . Oh , I heard her in the garderobe , squawking to her ladies that I 'd no right to be seated above the salt . She called me a pantry wench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lady Eleanor spoke some truth , if not all of it , " murmured Geoffrey , but not loud enough to further inflame his wife , who suddenlyforgot her grievance at discovering the sauce stains on her veil and began to rub them furiously . Geoffrey recrossed his legs and considered with amusement the Lady Eleanor 's contempt . Scribbling wool-counter no doubt he was , but a much traveled one on the King 's secret service . Peace negotiations , royal marriage negotiations , in France , in Flanders , in Italy ,  |p393he  had acquitted himself well in these . Though general recognition might be pleasant , its absence was not upsetting . " I wot myself best how I stand For what I dree , or what I think I will myselven all it drink .... " He had written that in his poem on the unreliability of Fame , verses Ile had started at Kenilworth and never quite finished . He had abandoned it before the end since the royal " love tidings " he had meant to celebrate had not materialized . The little Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Richard . There were love tidings aplenty now to celebrate . He glanced again at the new-wed couple . Henry , chunky and serious in his white velvet suit , was politely trying to entertain his pop-eyed bride by carving a horse out of bread . And Geoffrey looked at the King , whose betrothalto Anne of Bohemia , sister of the Holy Roman Emperor , would soon be public . Richard at barely fourteen still resembled a golden meadow full of pink and white daisies . His German bride-to-be , a year older , was reputed to be lumpish and brown as a nut . It was hard to fit either the flowery conceits of courtly love , or the forthright pleasures of mature mating to these dynastic marriages of children . Geoffrey 's eyes veered to the Lady Elizabeth , the Duke 's younger daughter . Her marriage yielded even less inspiration . At Kenilworth last summer when Elizabeth was sixteen she had become the Countess of Pembroke by means of an eight-year-old husband , John Hastings , who had promptly suffered an attack of measles and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Elizabeth would wait until the years should bring virility to her little husband . At this moment her cheeks were flushed , her dark eyes bright with wine , or lechery , as she lolled against John Holland and teased him with pouting lips . The King 's half brother was no Joseph , and his repute for wenching was great . It was a wonder that the Duke did not curb his wild young hoyden , but the dallying pair were hidden from his sight behind a festoon of hanging bayleaves , and none so easily hoodwinked as a fond father  --  except a husband . There remained the Lady Philippa . Decorous as always , she sat smiling quietly at some quip made by her Uncle Edmund . Her pale hair was braided in the old manner at either side of her cheeks . She had much of her mother 's gentle dignity , but never Blanche 's beauty.  |p394Of  Philippa there had been many , abortive , love tidings . Scarcely a prince in Europe but had been mentioned for her husband , but none found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwed , and happy that she was still virgin , Katherine had said . Geoffrey 's eyelids drooped as he thought with sudden impatience that though poetical eulogies of royal matings often produced pleasingrewards , he no longer felt the requisite chivalric fervor to do them justice . St. Valentine concerned himself with common folk as well as courtly ones , and the saint 's influence on all folk was humorous enough to the onlooker . Yet it was no saint , nor Venus or Cupid , who moderated the affairs of love . No one but Dame Nature . And a gathering of amorous birds would serve to show various kinds of love as well as any gallant knights and languishing ladies . The turtledove , the falcon , the goose , the cuckoo and the eagle  --  he thought , much entertained with his idea  --  fowls of every kind , a parliament of fowls . He started as a wand of jingling bells thumped him on the shoulder . The Lord of Misrule stood on the inside of the board grinning down at him beneath a red-spotted half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin . " ' T is crime to doze when all make merry ! In punishment we decree that you give us a rhyme . Come tell of love , my master ! Tell us of love ! " Geoffrey laughed and rose . His loosened girdle fell off with a clatter of sword , another button popped off his surcote . " I am undone , Your Majesty , " he twinkled to Robin . " Your pardon . " " Ay  --  granted  --  ay  --  " cried the young squire , shaking his fool 's scepter threateningly . " But sing to us of love ! " The young people on the dais ceased chattering as the King stood up , hushed the minstrels and watched expectantly . Richard had an eager appreciation of poetry as of all the arts and though he preferredFrench , had read one or two of Master Geoffrey 's English translationswith pleasure . Katherine rose too , and seeing that it was Geoffrey that Robin teased , walked a few steps down the Hall and smiled at him encouragingly . Geoffrey bowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Since I from Love escaped am so fat I think no more to be in prison leanSince I am free , I count him not a bean .... " He sat down . There was a startled roar of indignation . " For shame , for shame , "  |p395called  Richard on a trill of his high childish laughter . " My Lord of A I isrule , you can not pass so ungentle an offense ! What penance will you give him ? " Robin waved his scepter as he considered . " By Saint Venus , I command that he shall kiss his wife ! " Philippa bridled at the shouts that greeted this , but Geoffrey promptly rose again and , seizing her by the chin , kissed her heartily on the lips . " ' T is naught so great a penance , " he cried , and her indignantsputterings died away . Then Robin 's usually level head forsook him . This brief time of power had made him drunker than the wassail . By all the rules of Christmas , no man could gainsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each man kiss the lady of his heart ! " He whirled , and before she had the faintest conception of what he would do , Robin had covered the few steps between them and , grabbingKatherine around the waist , pressed his eager young mouth passionately to hers . Few people saw it , because Robin 's command was being obeyed , in a whirl of fumblings and giggles and coquettish screams . Katherine was so astounded that for a moment she could not move . She had continued to treat Robin as a boy and had come scarcely to notice the adoring looks he gave her , hut this was no boyish peck . It was a man 's kiss , hot with desire , and when she finally jerked her head away , he whispered , " Three years I 've waited for this , my heart 's life . I shall die if you be not kind to me ! " and he kissed her again . " Jesu , my poor Robin  --  you 're mad , " she whispered , pushing at his chest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and muttered a torrent of love words against her cheek . She gave him a great terrified shove  --  as a voice spoke beside them . " Here 's a pretty little piece of Christmas mumming ! ' T would seem you play your parts well . " The voice of stone , the eyes of murderous blue flint . Robin 's arms slackened . She released herself and cried wildly , " To be sure , my lord  --  why riot ? The King of Misrule must be obeyed , it seems he feels most sportive , and has just told me he would kiss all the ladies . " " No ! " cried Robin , past all caution , and still gazing at her through the mask . " I want only  --  " " The Lady Isabella , " cried Katherine , seizing the arm of Edmund 's light-minded wife , and thrusting her at Robin . " Here 's a king dies of love for you , my lady ! " Isabella giggled and preened herself , her voluptuous Castilian eyesp396gleamed at Robin . She hiccuped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My lord , " said Katherine to John , moving quickly , " shall we not join the dancing ? " Here at Leicester a special chamber had been built for dancing . The King and the bride already were gyrating hand in hand in the popular Pavo . " Nay , my lady , " said the Duke , " I do not feel like dancing . " " You 're tired , my dearest lord , come to our solar , we 'll rest awhile . " " I feel no need of rest . " He did not look at her , the corners of his nostrils were dented white . He swung on his heel and strode under the minstrels ' gallery towards the guardroom , where his men-at-arms were feasting . Katherine ran after him in great fear . She had forgotten in these three quiet years that his eyes could look like that  --  " My lord , " she cried desperately , " You can not be angry at a boy 's tipsy yuletide kiss . ' T is unworthy of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at last he stopped by a torchlit recess and turned on her . " Tipsy  --  ay ! Wine makes a windowfor the truth . I marked well how little you resisted , no doubt because these kisses are not so unaccustomed . " Her own eyes blazed as hot as his , but she knew that Robin 's safety depended on her control . " I must believe that this outrageous slur gives proof of your love , " she said trembling . " If you have lived so long with me and can not trust , then all our life is mockery . " John 's fists fell slowly open . Her bitter voice spoke to his heart but yet he was deafened by the shock he had felt when he saw her in another man 's arms . A new shattering pain , since never by word or deed had she given him cause for jealousy . He had seen how men admired her , but so sure had he always been of her love that no doubts had troubled him . " If you did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect him , and thrust Isabella at him ? " he cried . " And why did n't you strike his foul slobbering face ? " Why not ? she thought . Why , because she liked Robin and love is not so plentiful in this world that one should receive it anywhere with odium . But this she could not say , so she told part of the truth . " I spoke for fear of you , my lord . What you would do  --  " " You think you need to guard my honor ? " he cried with new fury . " This yeoman churl that I hired as squire , did you think I 'd challenge him to knightly combat ! Indeed Katrine , ' t is your own peasant blood that speaks  --  ' t is perhaps the bond between you two . "  | " Ay  --  Your Grace ? " said Katherine , flatly , staring at him . After a moment she continued , " I thought you would set your guards on him  --  though your chivalry might well breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was no sound in the passage , except the Duke 's harsh breath . Music and the gliding of feet came from the dancing chamber , the dissonance of befuddled voices from the Hall . The torch sputtered and flared brighter . Katherine 's eyes stared into those of the Duke . At last he sighed and dropped his head . " I 'm sorry , Katrine , " he said unsteadily , " but the sight of you in that ribaud 's arms  --  " His hands shot out . He grabbed her shoulders and yanked her towards him . He bent and kissed her savagely . " Were his kisses sweet as mine , lovedy ! Did your mouth open for him too ? " His fingers dug into her shoulders until the skin sprang up livid . She gave a sobbing laugh . " You know that you are my whole life  --  you know it  --  " " Dear Christ , that I should love you still like this , " he said through his teeth . " That I can desire you now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bordeaux  --  do you feed me love potions , Katrine ? " " No , do I have need to ? " she whispered . They stood looking at each other , breathing as though they raced with time . He caught her round the waist . " Come , " he said , and pulled her down the passage towards the solar stairs . " No , " she cried , " we 've been gone long now . What will they think ? You can not so slight the King ! " He laughed in his throat . " The King will wait on love as well as any man . " In the partially emptied Flail , the varlets stacked the trestle boards and renewed the candles . Geoffrey still sat on , warming himself at the fire . His Philippa had gone to sleep in a chair and snored softly , with her hands folded on her stomach . Some knights and squires slept too against the walls , while others diced or pitched pennies . Geoffrey had seen what passed between Katherine , Robin and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning . But he had seen something else as well  --  the look on Blanchette 's face when Robin kissed her mother . He was fond of his pretty niece , but she puzzled him as he knew she did Katherine , who treated the girl 's dark moods with an anxious forbearance . Blanchette 's marigold curls and dimples , her small deli/cate body , belied the intensity of her somber slate-gray eyes . Girls of about fourteen were often flighty , but Blanchette 's brooding silences , her stammering speech and unwillingness to join with other young folk in any pastime seemed stranger than the normal humors released by puberty . Throughout the banquet , Blanchette had sat next to a stalwart knight called Sir Ralph Hastings , who was cousin to the Earl of Pembroke . Sir Ralph owned much land in Yorkshire near Pontefract , he was one of the Duke 's most able knights ,  --  and a widower . Recently he had become enamored of Blanchette and had asked Katherine for her , who had told the Chaucers of it . " A splendid marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what luck ! Why , she 'll have noble kin  --  she 'll be cousin to the Lady Elizabeth ! Speed the matter , Katherine , lest Sir Ralph change his mind . ' T is not everyone would want a sulky little snip like Blanchette , and no heiress either . " " She has income from the Deyncourt wardship , my lord granted her , " said Katherine slowly , " and her share some day in Kettlethorpe . But the child says she hates Sir Ralph . " " Rubbish ! " had cried Philippa sharply . " She but hates whatever you , or His Grace , tell her to do . ' T is the very thing for her , a wise older man 'll soon straighten out these dumpish moods . You humor her too much . " " Maybe  --  " Katherine 's smooth brow had creased in a worried frown . " My lord thinks so . Yet it twists my heart to force the child  --  " Blanchette had however been forced to the extent of sitting next to Sir Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , Sir Ralph , with high florid color , and curling brown beard . Blanchette sat beside him with downcast head , until Robin began to jingle and caper along the Hall between the trestles . Then her great clouded eyes had fixed on Robin and at the moment when he kissed Katherine , Geoffrey had seen the girl start back and whiten . She had left the table at once , gliding out into the courtyard . Nor had she returned to the Hall . Was that violent flinching because the girl had some special feeling for Robin ? Was it because she felt her mother besmirched ? It was hard to tell what Blanchette felt . But , Geoffrey thought pityingly , there was a fey quality about the girl , not sulky as Philippa and many others believed  --  but tragic . On the morning after the banquet , John and Katherine lay late in bed , as did most of the castle inhabitants . The winter sun had risenp399to its full brilliance , and the folk of Leicester town were already out skating and sliding on the frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the holidaymakers on the ice , and seeing a strip of orange-colored light through the brocaded bed curtains , murmuredthat it would be a fine day for the stag hunt in Leicester forest , and yawned voluptuously . In the great enclosed bed it was warm , snug as a walled garden . She lazily kissed the corner of John 's jaw , and nestled against him , savoring with drowsy delight the hard strength of his muscles . He acknowledged her caress with a smile and a gentle pinch on the satin skin of her hip , but he had been awake for some time , and thinking . " Lovedy , " he said , " Robin Beyvill must go . I 'll not answer for my temperance , if I see him making calf eyes at you now , and besides there 's another reason . " Katherine blinked . She had quite forgotten Robin . " Yes , " she said thoughtfully , " it were better he leave here  --  but not in disgrace , my dear lord . He 's served you well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . To the Scottish border  --  to my fortress of Liddel . There he may cool his ardors by taming the Scots , who are rampaging as usual . God bless them . " John chuckled . He still had affection for the violent brood that harassed the Border , affection born of his early visit with his father when he was a lad , and which was incongruously enough returned . He could arrange truces with the Scots , when no one else could . Certainlynot Percy , who had deliberately provoked the latest Scottish hostilities . Percy be damned , John thought . The Earl of Northumberlandhad taken to snorting and pawing at the Lowlands again , regardless of England 's safety  --  and need . At last a new approach had opened towards the seizure of Castile , to the final victory over France . This was no time for enraging the ancient rival to the north , as well . Two incredibly fortunate deaths had given England her chance to strike . Last year the usurping Castilian bastard , Trastamare , had died , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles the Fifth , the wily avocat who had so long plagued the English , was gone too . His successor , Charles , was but a boy of twelve , and subject to fits . Spain and France were both , therefore , virtually leaderless , plunged into turmoil . And Portugal had risen as an English ally . " Ay , " said John aloud on a note of solemn exultation , " This time we 'll succeed . I know it . " Katherine stiffened inwardly . She had no need to ask what hep400meant . Nowadays he told her freely of his plans , and she had never but once requited his confidence with the intrusion of her personal fears . That once she had said , " But what will happen to me , my lord , if you enter at last into your kingdom ? " And he had answered in surprise , " Why you 'll come too , Katrine , after Castile 's affairs have settled down . There 's a little castle on the Arlanzon outside of Burgos where you shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget the pangs this prospect gave her , and the bitter misgivings . As anointed Queen of a Castile which she herself had brought to John , would Costanza show the same forbearance she showed now when she was but a penniless alien in her husband 's country ? And already there had been a change . Philippa said that when the Duchess heard the news of Trastamare 's death , she had laughed loud and shockingly . She had decreed a three-day festival at Hertford , her chapel bell had pealed from dawn to dusk and her jewel-studded statue of the Virgin was carried through the streets to the accompanimentof Spanish hymns of thanksgiving . And she had summoned the Duke to Hertford , where he had stayed a week  --  all matters it were better not to think of . " Thank God , darling , " said Katherine at last , sighing , " that at least you do n't leave England soon . ' T is something I could n't bear . " He frowned . Her remark pressed on a subject of deep concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new campaign . But he himself must remain at home for a while to strengthen domestic affairs , and cope with both Scottish and Welsh disorders . Richard 's council , the Princess Joan and his own judgment had concurred in this policy , though it irked him and he had little trust in Edmund 's diplomacy in Portugal . " I 'd not stay here , lovedy , " he said gravely , " if it were n't wiser in the long run . " " Nay , " she said with a sharp laugh . " I know your love for me could never keep you here  --  nor should it , " she added with quick penitence . " Forgive me . " He turned and looked at her : the luminous eyes between their thick black lashes , the straight little nose , the voluptuous red mouth above the cleft chin , the transparent rose of her cheeks , the tumbled bronze of her fragrant hair , and the blue veins and white curves of her firm full breasts . " By the Holy Rood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half rueful , " Ip401hope it 's not you who keeps me here . That were shame indeed . " There were those who thought so ; Costanza did . He had denied it furiously and with truth . No woman , not even Katherine , could turn him from his goal . As the Castilian throne drew nearer to his grasp its lure shone even brighter . But he had learned prudence in these last years , and the need for careful planning . Money must be raised for an army , and sporadic little bursts of rioting , not only on the borders , but in English shires , must be put down with a firm hand  --  And then Castile . Katherine heard his deep breath , and knew that he was thinking of those sun-baked plains that he had shown her from their mountaintopin the Pyrenees . She understood now better than she had then why that faraway land was the summit of his dreams . She no longer wondered that he was not satisfied with being the greatest nobleman in England and its virtual ruler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king of a country nearly twice as large as England . What complete answer that would be to continuing slanders that he plotted for Richard 's throne ! And , thought Katherine  --  that other thing . The ghost of the changeling story had been laid , even his enemies had forgotten it , and John could now refer to it with no more than the passing scorn he gave to all rumors about him . But the scar was there . The King of Castile would be far above all rumors . " We must get up , slug-a-bed , " said John with sudden energy pushingdown the ermine coverlet . " Ring the bell . " There were two more days of merrymaking before Richard and the other guests would leave . Stag hunt this afternoon . Bullbaiting and some jousting tomorrow . The season had unfortunately made it impossible to hold a tournament . Katherine reached an arm through the curtains for the hand bell which would summon Hawise and a valet of the chamber . The bell made her think of Robin , who as body squire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My lord , you spoke of a second reason why Robin must be sent away ? " " Lollard , " said John succinctly , thrusting one leg out of bed . " But , " she protested , " you 've never been against the Lollards ! " Half the court , the Princess Joan and until recently John himself had subscribed to most of Wyclif 's doctrines . " The Lollards now go too far , " said John impatiently . " Their preachers are inflaming the people . And you know very well that I can no longer champion poor old Wyclif . I think his wits 've addled.  |p402Though  I 'll not let his enemies harm him either . He shall propound his dreadful new heresies in peace at Lutterworth , but I want no active Lollards in my meinie . " The chamber valet came in and drew back the curtains while anotherpoked the fire into a blaze . A squire presented his lord with a silver tankard of ale . Another held John 's scarlet velvet dressing gown . Hawise delayed a little in coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawise had been up with the nurse , rubbing the little gums with clove syrup . Katherine could not spring naked from the bed when the chamber was filled with men , and as she snuggled in the warm hollow to wait for Hawise to bring her robe , she thought briefly about Wyclif , knowing that the reformer had sharply disappointedJohn . Wyclif against the bishops , and the corrupt clergy , had been worthy of help . Wyclif against the Pope , particularly that now , since the schism in ' seventy-eight there were most confusingly two popes , had merited many an intelligent person 's approval . Wyclif against the spiritual teachings of the Church was another matter . John had been sympathetic with the Englished Bible which Wyclif wanted given to the people , there was no harm in that , and the Duke believed in learning . He had been patient with the fiery black-robed doctor 's arguments against the idolatry of saints , the folly of pilgrimage , the futility of confession : But lately Wyclif had attacked the sacredness of the Mass itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had actually stated that the consecrated wafer and the wine did never change at all into the Blessed Body and Blood , that they were merely symbols . He had said it was better to worship a toad than the Sacrament , for a toad at least had life . And here John 's long tolerance had shattered . Perhaps , thought Katherine , Brother William had had something to do with John 's revulsion against Wyclif . The Gray Friar himself no longer had the least sympathy for the reformer . And as for me , thought Katherine wearily , I can not care either way . The observance of her religion had become dim , meaningless , boring . John was truly devout in a hearty male way . He believed as his father and mother had believed , so Wyclif had ended by horrifying him . And yet , she thought , it was like him to continue to protect Wyclif despite their quarrel . His enemies misunderstood as usual . They gave him no credit for the loyalty that was his strongest trait . When he showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine , what use top403dwell on gloomy things ? Today we 'll have the stag hunt and tonight we 'll dance , my lord and I. She smiled , for their bodies were attuned in all ways and they danced so well together that even the most spiteful were forced to admire . " God 's greeting , my lady , " said Hawise popping her broad face through the curtains . " You look gay as a goldfinch . My lord too  --  " She gestured with her white-coiffed head towards the garderobe , where the Duke 's voice could be heard singingAmour et ma dame aussi Votre beaute m'a ravie ! while his squires rubbed him down with an herb-steeped sponge . " His Grace is in good spirits , I hear . ' T was not his mood last night in the Hall , by corpus ! " She enveloped Katherine in a chamber robe , encased the slim feet in embroidered kid slippers . " How do you know that ? " asked Katherine startled . " Even common folk 've eyes , sweeting . ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bussed you too hotly last night , and the Duke went black as iron . Some thought he 'd beat you to a jelly with a pikestaff , some that Robin 's bloody corpse 'd be found afloating in the Soar ; but I never fretted . You can do anything with his grace nowadays . " The two women walked into Katherine 's garderobe . It was warmed by a charcoal brazier and smelled agreeably of smoke and Katherine 's amber essence . The stone latrine was shut off by a heavy tapestry , much to Hawise 's disapproval . She considered Katherine 's nose too squeamish . The stench of latrines was well known to be the best preventive of moth , and without it Katherine 's perch-hung rows of fur and wool garments were in grave danger . Katherine sat clown on a stool and Hawise commenced combing out the long tangled hair . " Robin leaves today for Cumberland , " said Katherine , while soakingher hands in a basin of warm cream . Still every winter she had to fight recurring chilblains . " Ay  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , but small wonder . He 's been panting for you like a thirsty dog , this age past . " " I did n't know  --  at least I never thought much about it , " said Katherine ruefully . " Half the young squires 're sighing and languishingafter somebody , it 's the fashion . " " Truth is  --  ye 're blind as a midday bat to all but the Duke , " said Hawise chuckling . She began to rub separate coppery strandsp404with a silk cloth to increase their sheen and added in a different tone , " Yet there 's one who 'll be heart-stricken that Robin 's to be sent off . " " Who ? " asked Katherine idly , patting her hands dry on a linen towel . " Blanchette , m'lady  --  nay , I see ye 'd not guessed . The poor little wench keeps a button he wore under her pillow , and I 've seen other signs . " Blessed Saint Mary  --  " cried Katherine on a long note of mingled pity and exasperation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Still it ca n't be serious , she 's too young , and Robin 's shown her no special notice , has he ? " " Nay . Robin 's had eyes for no woman but you . " Katherine sighed . This then was one explanation of Blanchette 's increasing hostility . Lately she had hurt Katherine by her silences , her stubborn refusal to comply with any of Katherine 's requests , though Katherine had shown tolerance in the matter of the betrothal to Sir Ralph . The Duke had even been annoyed with her about it . Blanchette could scarcely hope for another such offer , and Sir Ralph was not the man to be kept dangling . " Robin 'd be no match for her , even if he 'd have her , " said Katherine slowly . " She must look higher than a hobbledehoy Suffolk yeoman . God 's blood , I do n't know what ails the girl . She cares nothing about all we 've done for her ! " Hawise was silent while she began the elaborate braiding of her mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this child who never smiled any more . Hawise wound and netted the thick braids at the back of Katherine 's head in readiness for the moony headdress later , and offered thoughtfully , " She seemed brighter on that visit to Kettlethorpe than I 've seen her in donkey 's years . " Kettlethorpe ! " repeated Katherine with disgust . She put down the mirror , and frowned at the unpleasant memory . A year ago in November , after she had recovered from the baby Joan 's birth , the Duke , having business in Lincoln , had decided that they should visit Kettlethorpe and see how Katherine 's property did . They took Tom and Blanchette in their train , so that the Swynford children might see their birthplace , and they had stayed at Kettlethorpefor three very uncomfortable days . The Duke had long ago appointed a resident steward under the direction of his Lincolnshire feodar , William de Spaigne , so that the manor had been kept in repair and was being as efficiently run asp405possible . But to Katherine , Kettlethorpe had presented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draughty and damp . Comfortswhich she had come to take for granted were entirely lacking , a dense November fog chilled the bones , and she , who was so seldom ill , promptly came down with violent chills , streaming nose and a racking cough . She had viewed her erstwhile home through a haze of physical and spiritual dis-ease . They had held a love day and ale feast in the manor Hall . Herded by the steward and a new reeve , her serfs had filed through and apathetically knelt to do her homage , while little Tom stood by her chair with a proud smile , savoring this parade of his own future possessions . But Katherine thought the serfs a poor-spirited mangy lot , and wondered that she had ever been afraid of them . Milburga had turned into a shrunken old woman with crippled joints , Will the cook trembled with palsy and had been ousted from the manor kitchens . Only Sir Robert , the priest , was much the same , fat , untidy and garrulous ; but Molly , his hearthmate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here before , some bowel complaint had carried off half of Laughterton . Then there had been three runaways . Odo the ploughman 's twin lads had taken to their heels and disappeared in Sherwood forest . Cob o ' Fenton , the former spit-boy had refused to pay his heriot fine on his father 's death , and made off too , but he had been caught at once and brought back . his property confiscated , he had been branded with an F on his left cheek , for " fugitive , " and was even now in the village stocks as an example . The steward reported that the unrest and disaffection amongst the serfs was truly shocking . Also , and here the steward had grown even more gloomy , there had been thefts and poaching . Hare and even a fat roebuck had been taken from Lady Swynford 's own enclosure . Sheep had been stolen from her flocks . Two of the culprits had been caught by the smell of roasting mutton in their cots . And hanged . The steward had walked Katherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up , beside the stocks where Cob the runaway was being punished . Cob had changed little since the old days . Still small and flaxen-polled , though he must be thirty . Between white lashes his pale eyes had stared at Katherine sullenly  --  while the branded F reddened on his cheek . She turned quickly from him , and recoiled as she saw the gibbet . Two rotting half-naked bodies dangled from the nooses . Katherinep406took one shrinking look and recognized  --  despite the bloated livid features  --  the long skull and jaw of Sim Tanner , the reeve . She gave a horrified cry and the steward said , " Ay , my lady . Sim took to thieving and poaching as soon as I turned him from his reeveship . Had got used to little luxuries no doubt , and would n't give ' em up . " So Sim had escaped Nirac 's dagger so long ago , to end finally like this . The fog swirled thickly in from the Trent , Katherine 's teeth chattered with another chill and she had hastened back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ordered that Cob be freed from the stocks , and that his plot of land be restored to him , for she had been sickened by all the sights on the village green . Dear Mother of God , how she had detested Kettlethorpe , and been in a frenzy to get away again . But now she remembered that Blanchette had not . The girl had visited all the haunts of her childhood , the Broom hills , the mill , the river ford and a little pool where she had once played with village children . As though some inner sluice gate had been raised , Blanchettehad asked a spate of eager , shy questions about her father . Was it here in the Hall that his armor had hung ? What had been his favorite horse 's name ? And she had said , " How old was I , Mama , when Father kissed me goodbye here on the mounting b  --  block , the last d  --  day I ever saw him when he left for Aquitaine ? " Katherine had answered that Blanchette must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered . " I d  --  do remember , " said Blanchette with a sad yet excited little smile . " God rest my dear brave father 's soul . " Katherine , lightheaded with her own illness and profoundly discomfitedby all these sights and memories , had paid little attention . She realized that both children thought Hugh had died of wounds sustained in glorious battle , since no details had been given them . But it was true enough the dysentery had been a kind of battle wound . There was no falsehood in that . " Ay  --  I remember now , " said Katherine finishing her thoughts aloud to Hawise , " that Blanchette wept when we left that odious place . But I feel ' t is morbid . She has everything to make her happy now in this new life the Duke has given her . I 'll certainly take a firmer hand , as he wishes . " Katherine 's face cleared and she waved away the huge gauzy goldhornedheaddress that Hawise lifted up . " Let be , for now  --  " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other children but that naughty little wench . I 'll not frighten the babies with that foolishp407thing , and I 'm off to the nurseries . How are Joan 's gums , poor mite ? " " Sore as boils , I 'll warrant , from the uproar she do make , " answered Ilawise dryly . " She yells louder'n any o ' her brothers did . " Katherine laughed , and the two women walked down the passages to the nursery wing . John and Harry had long since gone out to play in the snow with other castle children , but her two latest-born were sitting on a bearskin rug by the fire . Thomas , so christened because he had been born on St. Thomas ii Becket 's Day , but called Tamkin to differentiate him from his half brother , Tom Swynford , was engaged in playing some private game with a set of silver chessmen the Duke had given him . Joan was solemnly chewing on a bone teething ring . Both children squealed with delight when they saw their mother . Tamkin jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katherine settled down on the bear rug with them , and kissing them both , pulled the baby into her lap . Joan immediately clutched at her mother 's necklace and succeeded in getting the whole of a balas ruby pendant into her mouth . " Nay  --  greedy one  --  " said Katherine extracting the pendant . " Hush , " for the little pink mouth opened wide for a roar . Katherine put her finger on the reddened gum and rubbed gently . " Fail dodofais dodo , chou-chou , mimi , brebis  --  tout fait do-do  --  " she crooned . Joan gave a fat pleased chuckle and quietened . Joan was an obstreperous and comical baby . Her brown hair grew in little wisps like a hedgehog , her eyes were purple-black and round as bilberries . She was the only dark one of all Katherine 's brood and she bore some resemblance to her Aunt Philippa Chaucer . Or could it be to another dark and Flemish Philippa ? " Did you know , my poppet , " said Katherine smiling down and tweaking the button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The baby gave a protesting squeal at the removal of the comforting finger , and Katherine gave her the teething ring . " Me too ! " cried Tamkin , waving La Ferce , the queen of his chess set . " And my grandsir was a king . Hawise telled me . " He trotted the plumed king on Katherine 's knee , and made a clicking hoof noise with his tongue . " When I get big , I 'll be a king . " " No , Tamkin  --  " said Katherine softly . " Never . " She looked at her small son . A true Plantagenet like the other boys . They all had the wavy hair , long fine nose , flat high cheekbones , light eyes ; though none quite so vivid a blue as their father 's . " Then what 'll I be ? " Tamkin rolled over on his stomach andp408began to stuff the tiny pawns into caves he poked in the bear fur . " A knight , darling  --  that you can be . A splendid brave knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , when it was fractured by a thrust of fear . If anything should happen to John , what would become of the Beaufort bastards ? She crossed herself and sat staring into the fire , while the baby gurgled drowsily on her lap , Hawise and the nurses came and went at their tasks , and Tamkin , tiring of his game , ran off to find his greyhound puppies . Even with the Duke 's all-powerful protection , what future did they have ? The boys might be knighted in due course by their father , and make their own way as best they could with the appointments he could give them , but they might not aspire to honors . And the baby Joan  --  It would take a stupendous amount of dowry to get her married properly . Few worthy noblemen would overlook the stain of bastardy . But if it should happen somehow  --  in terror , her mind veered from facing the actual thought again  --  that John could not see to their future , who would protect them then ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly not the Earl of Buckingham . Edmund might make a feeble gesture , but when did Edmund 's vacillatingimpulses ever persist for long ? It was a treacherous marshy ground over which she had so blithely walked , thinking it firm as granite . She looked at the baby in her lap , at Tamkin , who was trying to teach one of his puppies to beg . She thought of her two handsome gently bred older boys , who were being reared like young princes . But they were not . They had no legal name , no certain inheritance of any kind , and no sure future but herself . Blessed Mary , she thought , and what could I do for them , alone ? She stilled her panic and forced her mind to a practicality that was repugnant to it . Deliberately she scrutinized the total of her few possessions . The Duke from time to time had given her property , which she had accepted with reluctance , disliking the idea of paymentfor her love . The private income that these brought her she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket money compared to the lavishness in which she lived . She had the meager Swynford inheritance , of course , though it was distasteful to her . Besides , it would belong eventually to Tom . She had a yearly hundred marks as governess 's recompense , but that would shortly stop , since Elizabeth was married and Philippa beyond the age . She owned houses in Boston , which brought in a small rent.  |p409She  had two wardships , including the Deyncourt one for Blanchette , some perquisites from the Duke 's Nottingham manors , and that was all , except her jewels . We could never live on that , thought Katherine , frightened . We 'd have less than yeoman status . And she determined at least to accept the new wardship and " marriage of the heir " John had semihumorouslyoffered her . " ' Twill be appropriate , Katrine . A neat turnabout for the insolencehe showed you . " Ellis de Thoresby , Hugh 's erstwhile squire , had been killed in a drunken brawl three months ago , leaving a two-year-old son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son that John offered her , and she refused sharply . She had neither seen nor heard of Ellis since he spat at her in the streets at Lincoln . She wanted no reminder of him . Ah , but I must be practical , thought Katherine . I 've been a soft fool . It was not mercenary to try and protect her children 's future , and when the right moment came she would talk to John about it . The moment must be chosen , for though he was generous , he preferred to think of such things himself , and she knew that he might be angered that she should seem to question the provision he intendedsome day to make for all his children . And he would be right , she thought with sudden revulsion . She could not appear to grasp and scheme as though she had forebodings for him . There was no danger that could threaten them when she had the certainty of his love . She would go on as she had been , nor worry about the future . Katherine picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking around to find the source of an exceptionally wintry draft , saw that Tamkin had opened the leaded window and was hanging halfway out . " Tam , " she called , " what are you doing ? Shut the window ! " The boy did not hear her , for there was much noise outside . The nursery windows looked down on Castle street , where a cluster of rustics and townfolk had gathered , while a man in a long russet gown stood on a keg and harangued them . Hawise came in bearing a pile of the baby 's breechclouts as Katherinewent over to her son . " ' T is only some Christmas mumming , " said Katherine impatiently , shutting the window . " Nay , " said Hawise peering over the little boy 's shoulder , " ' T is that Lollard preacher , John Ball , just come to Leicester , I hear . He'sp410been jabbering and havering since Prime . I do n't much like the look o ' it . " " Whyever not ? " said Katherine in surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , Mama , " said Tamkin , " over ' n ' over , ' n ' shaking their fists . " " They do , " said Hawise grimly . " D'ye know what they sing ? " Katherine looked out again more curiously . She saw that the preacher had a fiery red face between a black beard and a crop of black hair on a round head , that he waved his arms violently and sometimes struck his russet-clad breast , pointing up to the sky , and then at the castle . Now and again he would stop with both arms wide outflung , when all the crowd of folk would stamp their feet and chant something that sounded like the rhythmic pound of a hammer on a smith 's anvil . " What do they sing ? " Katherine said and opened the window wide . The hoarse pounding shouts gradually clarified themselves into words : When Adam delved and Eva span , Who was then the gentleman ? " What nonsense ! " began Katherine  --  and checked herself . " What do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Hawise . " This last poll tax has really roiled ' em , and John Ball 's doing his best to keep ' em roiled  --  throughout the land . " " Oh , " said Katherine shrugging as she turned from the window . " The poll tax is hard on folk , no doubt , but wars must be paid for , Hawise . Why must they show so much hatred ? " " ' T is easy to hate , lady dear , when you be poor and starving . " " But they 're not ! " cried Katherine , her eyes flashing . " Nobody starves in Leicester , or any of the Duke 's domains . The kitchens often feed three hundred a day . " " ' T is not everyone wants to be beggars , sweeting , " said Hawise chuckling . " And there 's mighty few who like to be unfree . " " The Duke has freed many of his serfs when they deserve it , " retorted Katherine hotly . " The eve of Christmas he freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' T is true , " said Hawise . " But there be ten thousand more in bondage . Ye needna look so fierce  --  ' t is not my thoughts I 'm giving  --  ' t is what that John Ball yammers out there . "  | " But what can they do ? " said Katherine , frowning towards the window , where again the doggerel pounded its inane rhythm . " Oh , they 'll not do anything , " Hawise shrugged . " ' T is naught but talk . England be a great place for windy grumbles . ' Twill all die down like stale ale . " THE LANCASTRIAN household held their May revels at the Savoy . The early spring had been stormy but by the end of April , days of warm sun and nights of gentle showers enameled the countryside with green luster . The Savoy servants trundled in barrowfuls of primroses and violets from the meadows near Tyburn , and made garlands to hang in each of the hundred rooms . They cut thick dewy branches of the rose-budded may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kitchens and Great Hall were strewn with new rushes and fragrant herbs . Every nook was spring-cleaned . The myriad windowpanes sparkled like diamonds set in lead ; the cream and beige tile floors were polished smooth as eggs , and the silk carpets and the tapestries of the State Chambers were scrubbed and flailed to their pristine glow . Gilt , vermilion and azure were brushed on the stone chimney carvings , while new-painted fleurs de luce powdered the vaulted ceilings between polished timbers . The offices of the chancery , the Great Treasure Chamber , the smithies , the barracks , the armorer 's shops , the falcon mew , even the cellars and the empty dungeon received new coats of whitewash and were decorated with greenery . A gilded Maypole had been set up in the river gardens on a square of turf which was enclosed by the famous Provencal rosebushes , alreadytipped with coral buds . Each afternoon of May week , there was dancing around the great shaft , while the multicolored ribbons wove up and down against a drift of pear blossoms.  |p412There  were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hide-and-Seek in the maze , or at Hoodman Blind and Hot Cockles . At night there were bonfires built along the riverbank , and the Duke 's barges , festooned with streamers and lit by torches , raced across the river while wagers were placed on each contestant . No one could be melancholy during these days of Maytime brightness , and the Duke shut his mind to impending problems and enjoyed himself wholeheartedly with Katherine . On May 12 , he was to set forth for Scotland again . The King 's Council , much pleased with his handling of earlier Scottish disorders , had commissioned him to ride north and negotiate for a prolongation of the truce and cessation of the new hostilities . Percy 's touchy sensibilities would have to be soothed . The Lord of Northumberlandfelt that Border matters were his own exclusive concern , and passionately resented interference from Westminster . But a combination of tact , flattery and sternness would doubtless pacify the Border lord as they had before . Everything contributed to the optimism born of Nature 's own gaiety . Parliament had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being raised , albeit there had been some trouble . The first collectors , through laziness or venality , had failed miserably to hand over the average shilling a head that was required . In March the system had been tightened and a fresh staff of collectors commissioned . The chancellor , who was now old Sudbury , Archbishop of Canterbury , had been scolded for his slackness ; and a new treasurer , Robert Hales , Prior of St. John 's , put in charge of the dilatory revenues . The common folk might grumble  --  to be sure , taxes always caused grumbling  --  but a democratic effort had been made to distributethis tax fairly , " with the strong to help the weak . " It was true that the levy of a shilling might wreak some hardship , amongest laborers and servants , since their wages seldom reached fourteen shillings a year ; but on the other hand , the glorious prospects of eventual victory in France and Castile should certainly move the people to patriotic sacrifice . Besides , this new tax , for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even a baron or a bishop was assessed at a pound a head . What could be fairer than that , thought the Peers , while the Royal Council and Parliament agreed . Katherine had been a trifle uneasy since she had heard John Ballp413preaching at Leicester , until the Duke told her that Ball had been imprisoned in Kent by Archbishop Sudbury . " No need to fret , lovedy , " said the Duke gaily . " With that rantinglittle firebrand quenched in jail , the people 'll quiet down . They 've no real cause for grievance , anyway . " Katherine was reassured . Yet she did say hesitatingly , " But the villeins are n't reasonable . My steward writes that at Kettlethorpe , Cob o ' Fenton has run off again ! Though I freed him from the stocks and gave him back his land . " John shrugged . " No doubt they 'll catch him , Katrine . ' T is always hard to judge when leniency be wise . Some serfs would have shown you greater gratitude . " She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely day must be enjoyed to the full , especially as she and John would so soon be separated . Yet she had little fear for him on this march to Scotland which he anticipated with pleasure , nor should it take more than a month or so . She was to await him at Kenilworth with their children , and Kenilworth was a happy summertime castle . On Sunday she would leave the Savoy with the Duke , who would drop her and her household off at Kenilworth while he continued north . But before they left there was a small private matter to be attended to . Sir Ralph Hastings would accompany his lord to Scotland , and Blanchette 's betrothal should be solemnized . It had been delayed after Katherine 's decision at Leicester because Sir Ralph had been at Pontefract , but now he had arrived at the Savoy , eager to claim the girl . This was on Wednesday , the eighth of May . The Duke and Katherine were sitting in the rose garden watching a troupe of Cornish tumblers and gleemaidens who were cavorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archway into the garden , and walking to the Duke 's chair knelt and kissed his hand . " God 's greeting , my lord , " he said , and bowed to Katherine . " I 'm here a clay before I thought to be , but love is a sharp spur , by Peter ! " He chuckled and swaggered in his violet brocaded cote-hardie . A wellmademan was Sir Ralph , and had spared no expense in clothing himself as finely as any young dandy at Richard 's court . Blanchette 's aversion to him he had assured himself sprang from charming modesty , being quite certain of his attraction . He was thirty-five and looked younger . He was an excellent horseman and jouster , and had been forbearing to the old wife he had been married to forp414twelve barren years until her lung complaint released him . Blanchette had no excuse whatsoever for her behavior , thought Katherine , smiling at Sir Ralph , who was asking after the girl . " I 'll get her  --  " said Katherine rising . " In truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Woo her gently . I confess she 's sometimes of a heavy spirit . " The knight frowned a trifle but he spoke confidently , " Oh I 'll soon gentle the little burde , once she 's mine . ' T is natural she should be shy . " " Natural , maybe , " said the Duke smiling . " But she 's played the coy long enough . We 'll have the betrothal tomorrow , a merry climax to May revelry . Here in the arbor  --  and some jousting to follow . Blanchette shall be May Queen for the day . " Katherine bestowed a loving glance on John as she hurried from the gardens in search of Blanchette . The girl lodged in a chamber in the Monmouth Wing , and could seldom be persuaded to leave it . Here she carried on many little occupations of her own . She had wooden puppets that she dressed in scraps of silk and velvet and played some secret game with , though she was well past the age for such toys . She strummed her lute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once if anyone came to the door . And there were her birds . Almost daily Blanchette sent the page who waited on her to the market . He fetched her singing birds  --  linnets , thrushes , skylarks and sometimes nightingales that had been netted by fowlers and were offered for sale . She had a ritual with these . She left them in their cages only one night ; while she talked to them softly as though they were Christian souls . At the dawning she would free them through her window and Godspeed them as they winged out of sight . A harmless enough pastime , but while Katherine stood at the girl 's door she heard the low voice inside singing a plaintive tune , and the twittering of a bird . As she put her hand on the latch , Katherine 's throat constricted while a memory assailed her  --  of the Lady Nichola in the tower room at Kettlethorpe . Nay , but the child is in nothing like Nichola , Katherine thought with vehemence . She pushed the door and found it locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' T is your mother . " After a moment the door opened slowly and Blanchette stood as though to bar the way , her hands clenched together between her breasts . Her copper-gold hair cascaded in loose ringlets down her back . She wore dove-gray chamber robe , unadorned . Never would she willingly wear any of the costly trinkets that the Duke or Katherine gave her . She was still shorter than her mother but her slight body showed the curves of womanhood , though her face had not lost its baby roundnessand a few freckles still peppered her nose . " Come , child , " said Katherine more gently , " why must you always act as though I 'd harm you ? I love you , and wish you nothing but good . It hurts me when you act like this . " The girl stood motionless on the tiles , her somber eyes fixed on Katherine . A tiny green linnet hopped and twittered in a wooden cage though the cage door had been opened . The lute lay on the window scat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a piece of parchment on which there were some straggling characters . Katherine moved to examine them , thinking to please Blanchette with praise for practicingher writing . She read the childish letters at a glance . I sigh when I singFor sorrow that I see . Robin is goneAnd thinks naught of me . Blanchette with a muffled cry rushed over and swooped up the parchment . She crumpled it in her shaking hand , while fury flashed iii her eyes . She turned on her mother and gasped , " What d  --  do you w  --  want of me , my lady ? " Katherine sat down on the window seat and shook her head . " You must n't blame me , dearling , for things I ca n't help , " she said quietly . " You must believe that all sorrows pass , and what you feel today you wo n't in a year . And you must believe that I know what 's best for you . " The girl said nothing . Her eyes moved from her mother 's pleadingface to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her fingers clenched the crumpled ball of parchment , and she flung it on the tiles . She that was the sweetest and the gentlest of children  --  Katherine thought  --  dear Lord , why is she like this now ? Ay , it must be I 've spoiled her . She sighed , then spoke with decision . " Blanchette , Sir Ralph has come . He 's in the garden with my lord . Your betrothal shall take place tomorrow . " Blanchette raised her eyes . " I 'll n  --  not , " she said through herp416teeth . " I 'll  --  run away . You 'll n  --  never find me  --  " Her voice shrilled and the stammer left her speech . " I 'll not do what he says , ever  --  I swear it by my father 's soul ! " She crossed herself and her face went white as clay . " This is wicked folly ! " cried Katherine . " ' T is not what the Duke says , ' t is what I say  --  " She gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You lie ! And I hate you ! You are naught but his creature , you and the scurvy pack of bastards that you bear him ! " She turned wildly and stumbling across the room flung herself on her bed . " Jesu , " whispered Katherine . She sat rigid on the window seat . A black wave submerged her and at length retreated , leaving behind a jutting rock of anger as refuge . She rose and stood by the bed . Blanchette 's face was buried in her arms , her shoulders shook but she made no sound . " This , Blanchette , is too much ! " Katherine said in a voice of icy control . " God knows if I can ever find it in my heart to forgive you . " Blanchette quivered . She twisted her face slowly around and stared up at her mother , and seeing there anger for the first time in her life , she gave a frightened moan . " Mama , " she whispered . Katherine moved away . Ay , she thought , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her humors , with the hatred she shows to John and me , and her jealousies of my babies . She blames me too that Robin did not love her , and now she speaks to me like that . " Since you are lost to decency and make wicked threats , Blanchette , " she said , " I shall see that you are strictly guarded night and day . One of my serving maids shall stay here with you , and a manat-armsremain outside the door . Tomorrow at noon there will be your bethrothal to Sir Ralph , and after that I 'll send you to a convent until your marriage . You may be thankful that I do n't beat you as you deserve . " She picked up the hand bell and rang . " Mama  --  " whispered Blanchette again . She slid off the bed . Her eyes were dark with fear . " I d  --  did n't m  --  mean  --  " Katherine answered frigidly , " Think not to wheedle me into softnessas you have so often . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a step . She turned her head from side to side , her eyes moved from the green linnet to the window , then back to her mother 's face . But Katherine did not look at her . One by one Katherine took the measures for Blanchette 's imprisonment . She summoned a serving wench , a taciturn Lancashire lass called Mab , and told her not to leave the girl alone a moment.  |p417She  stationed a man-at-arms outside the door , telling him to enter if the servant should call . She herself bolted the door on the outside as she left . Then she went back to the gardens and told Sir Ralph that he would see Blanchette on the morrow at the betrothal , but that the girl was indisposed at present . The knight was not pleased . In the Avalon Chamber Katherine tossed and turned that night until John anxiously asked her what ailed her and suggested that a warm sleeping posset be sent for . She reassured him and kissed him . But she did not tell him of what had passed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help it . He held her close in his arms and after a while she slept , soothed by the familiar comfort of his love ; but her sleep was filled with confused bitterness . Blanchette acted throughout the morning of her betrothal like one of the jointed puppets that she played with in her chamber . She let the Lancashire wench and Hawise array her in a gown of myrtlegreensatin and embellish her with jewels , her own and Katherine 's . She raised her arms and lowered them when they told her to . They twined flowers in her flowing hair and garlanded her with lilies . She never spoke at all nor seemed to know what they were doing , but once , when Hawise stood back admiringly and said , " God 's blood , my poppet , I vow you 're near as fair as your mother was on her bridal day ! " Then a strange look came into Blanchette 's eyes  --  of pain , of fear , of revulsion , Hawise could not tell , but it was a relief to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she had been drugged with poppy juice , for all that her eyes glittered glassy bright and her cheeks were crimson . When Blanchette was dressed , Hawise went to fetch Katherine , who had stayed inflexibly away from her daughter . " She 's ready , my lady , " said Hawise , " but I fear she 's sickening with something . Her skin 's hot as fire to touch , and she do seem strange even for Blanchette . " " Bah ! " said Katherine , " there 's no more wrong with her than ill temper that she 's being made to obey at last . ' T is not the first time she 's acted illness when she wanted her own way . " Hawise knew that this was true , but still she was uneasy and she said hesitatingly , " I hear there 's some sickness in t'Outer Ward . " Katherine , who was examining her face in the mirror , preparatory to descending to the garden for the betrothal ceremony , looked upp418and caught her breath . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nay , " Hawise crossed herself . " Saint Roch protect us ! Some pink-spotted fever ' mongst the children . " " Oh measles , no doubt , " said Katherine returning to the mirror . " I think Blanchette had them long ago , nor has she seen anyone to catch them from . Hawise , you croak like an old raven today . " " ' T is the toothache , " said Hawise gloomily , exploring a jumping molar with her tongue . " I 've said all the charms , I prayed to Saint Apollonia , but ' two n't stop . The barber 'll have to pull it , like the others , God help me . " An agonizing prospect sufficient to cause Hawise 's general apprehensions , but she had not told Katherine all that she knew of the sickness . It might be measles , but not like cases she had nursed . A little spit-boy had died in the night , screaming with head pain and scarlet as a boiled crawfish , and the page who waited on Blanchette was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chapel bell began to ring , in the Outer Ward the clock manikins clanged out the first of twelve strokes . Katherine jumped up and hurried to the Monmouth Wing . Blanchette was waiting . She looked once at her mother and then at the window , while Katherine said " Come " sternly and took the girl 's hand , which was certainly dry and hot as a hearthstone . They walked through the courtyards and the archway to the gardens . Amongst assembled lords and ladies , Sir Ralph and the Carmelite , Walter Dysse , waited by a portable altar in the rose arbor . The Duke stood resplendent beside them , dressed in his gold and pearl embroidered tunic , wearing the chain of Castile and the Order of the Garter . Jesu , how handsome he is , Katherine thought as she advanced gravely , holding Blanchette by the hand . The girl moved like a sleepwalker , but suddenly as Katherine started to place the little hand in the outstretched one of Sir Ralph , Blanchette gave a strangled cry and sprang back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran frantically away through the archway . " By God , what 's this ! " cried the Duke , while Sir Ralph flushed crimson , staring after Blanchette . " She shall be beaten for it , " cried Katherine , herself trembling with anger . " Nay , my lord , " she said to John , " I beg you let me deal with her  --  " Angry as she was she must still protect Blanchette from the expression she saw in both men 's eyes . The Duke hesitated before he shrugged . I-ie gestured to thep419minstrels and said with formal courtesy to Sir Ralph , " I 've a troupe of gleemen may divert you from this shameful behavior . " The knight bowed silently , biting his lips , while Katherine hurried back through the archway , and saw Blanchette at once , behind a yew tree , on the inner side of the wall . The girl was doubled up on the ground and had been vomiting . Katherine stared , and her anger became fear . " Oh my poor child , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother without recognition . " Hurts  --  " ' she muttered hoarsely , putting her hand to her head . Her fingers touched the garland of lilies and she pulled it off . " White swans , " she said , wrenching at the lilies and throwing them up into the air . " I must let them fly away home like the others . " Dear God , thought Katherine , with a stab of terror . But as she touched Blanchette , trying to raise her , she knew that this was the madness of fever , not lunacy . The girl 's body gave off heat like an oven , her face and neck , even her chest , were scarlet , and her teeth began to chatter in a convulsive chill . Katherine called out repeatedly for help . In the garden they did not hear her , the minstrels were playing and the company were dancing . But the Savoy 's sergeant-at-arms , Roger Leach , was berating the lazy porter at the Beaufort Tower and he heard her , and came running . In response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried her to the Monmouth Wing . " ' T is what they call the scarlet sickness , my lady , " said the burly soldier pityingly as he put the moaning , struggling Blanchette down on her bed . One of his own babes had had it a fortnight past . " They mostly goes out o ' their heads wi ' ut for a while . " Katherine threw her headdress on the window seat and twisted up her long silver sleeves . She dipped a napkin in a flagon of water and held it as best she could to Blanchette 's tossing forehead . " Get me Hawise , quick ! " she cried to the sergeant . " Then fetch Brother WilliamAppleton  --  nay , I do n't know where he is  --  at Grayfriars may he . But get him ! " The sergeant bowed and hurried away . Katherine sat on the bed and tried to quiet her delirious child . On Sunday when the Duke departed for Scotland , Blanchette was better . The fever persisted but now she did not cry out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesh of tiny scarlet dots , andp420she seemed to feel less pain . Brother William had bled her and had her rolled in cool cloths . He had given her febrifuges and opiates . He said that now though she was still in danger , he had great hopes of her recovery . Katherine could not leave Blanchette alone , so Hawise and the Beaufort babies were to travel up to Kenilworth without her . The Gray Friar would not allow Katherine to say farewell to her smaller children . This disease lived in the breath , Brother William said , and breath was so subtle an element that there was no telling what it might permeate . So he had a brimstone candle burned in Blanchette 's chamber . But there was little danger for older people , their breaths were strong and could fight off the evil miasma . The Sunday morning when Katherine said goodbye to the Duke there was a storm as they came out of the chapel after Mass . The sky grew purple , lightning forked through black clouds and thunder rocked the palace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The knights and men-at-arms were already mounted in the Outer Ward , the baggage wagons and the chariot with Hawise and the Beauforts already crammed in , were lined up for the start . Katherine spoke apologetic words to Sir Ralph , who received them courteously , but it was evident his ardor had cooled when he remarked that no doubt he would see Blanchette again sometime , after his return from Scotland . Katherine sadly gave him the stirrup cup , and turned to wave to her children in the chariot . The little boys waved back and Hawise held Joan up and made her kiss her hand to her mother . Katherine tried to smile . She went away quickly to follow John into a little anteroom below the Avalon Chamber . He was dressed in full armor , the squire outside held his latten battle helmet in readiness . Katherine raised her arms to him , gazing at him piteously . Tears ran down her cheeks . " Lovedy , " he cried kissing her , " you must n't weep . Blanchette will soon be well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we planned . " He smiled down at her . " Ay , " she said , but another crash of thunder rattled the windowpanesand she jumped and shivered . " ' T is evil omen , " she whispered . " Sunday thunder . Tonnerre de dimanche est tonnerre de diable ! ' " She crossed herself . " John , there 's danger  --  I feel it . A blackness in my heart black like the sky out there . John , must we be - parted now ? " He crossed himself too , but impatiently . He was eager to be off , and he had scant faith in omens when they did not accord with his wishes . " The storm 'll soon be over , Katrine . Already ' t is lifting . It421must be strain from nursing that coddled , vexing child gives you dark whimsies . Come , smile , lovedy  --  I 'd not take the memory of adismal face to Scotland ! " She tried to obey him but she could not . She saw that he had already gone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural . His men were waiting in the court for word to start , days of hard riding were ahead and already the storm had delayed them . He bent to kiss her again and with finality , but the oppression in her breast sharpened to panic . " John , " she cried , " I 'm afraid . Something threatens our love . I know it ! " She threw her arms around his neck , pressing her face to the harsh steel links of his gorget . He had never seen her so excited and unreasonable . He stroked her head as she clung to him sobbing , and said tenderly , " Hush  --  hush , " mastering his impatience because he loved her . But as she continued to weep he took her hands and pulled them down from his neck , " Farewell , my love . God keep you . " He strode out of the anteroom before she could stop him . She watched from the window while his squires held his stallionand he mounted . The rain had stopped . Brightness flowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Monmouth Tower , his brass helmet glinted as he turned and waved goodbye . She leaned from the window and slowly waved her silver scarf . He spurred his horse , which leaped ahead through the gateway to the Strand . The cavalcade formed after him and clattered two by two through the arch . The chariot and baggage train filed after . Katherine watched until the stableboys returned to their tasks and the great Outer Ward was empty . Even the yapping dogs had slunk back towards the kitchens . Quiet fell on the whole great Savoy Palace , three-quarters emptied now . The subdued drowsing state that it would show until its lord returned to it again . And its lord , as he cantered along the country road through the village of Charing Cross , suddenly reined in his stallion and looked back to gaze at the fair white palace which was more completely home to him than any of his country castles . It sparkled in the after-storm sunshine . He smiled tenderly at Katherine 's dismalness , and thought that the Savoy set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tasseled bridle and spurred his stallion , which bounded northward . No premonition told the Duke that he had looked his last on the Savoy.  |p422Throughout  the rest of May and the first week of June , Katherinelived in a seclusion as complete as though she were on an island . She moved into the Monmouth Wing , and for the days of Blanchette 's danger slept in the chamber with her child . She saw no one but Mab , who shared the nursing , the varlets who brought food and Brother William , who came daily to examine the patient . Blanchette improved gradually , the rash faded , her body no longer burned with raging heat ; but a succession of complications bedeviled her . For some days her throat was so swollen that she could not swallow , and when this abated she suffered from excruciatingearaches until the drums burst and prurient matter ran out on her pillow . During this time the girl reverted to her childhood and looked to her mother for everything , weeping and fretting if Katherine left the room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though it had never been , and Katherine poured out a remorseful love . It was nothing but coincidence that Blanchette had come down with her illness on the day of her betrothal , and yet Katherine could not quite rid herself of guilt , and she thought now that Blanchette 's outrageous insolence on the day before had stemmed from the beginning of the fever , too , and was sorry that it had made her so angry . As the girl finally improved , Katherine knew that all her strong love for this child was now augmented by the crisis they had passed through together . Blanchette had gained the added preciousness of something nearly lost which one has oneself saved from destruction . On the ninth of June , a month after the onset of her illness , Brother William pronounced Blanchette definitely on the mend . It was in the long golden dusk that the Franciscan friar came to visit his patient and found the girl sitting propped up in the window seat with Katherine beside her . Blanchette 's head rested against her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she seemed shockingly diminished because the lovely hair had begun to fall out in handfuls , and Katherine had resolutely cut it short to strengthen the new growth . Huddled up in her dressing robe , cuddling against her mother , and with the little shorn head , she might have been a child of five , and the Gray Friar upon entering felt an unwelcome softness . As a humane physician he had answered Lady Swynford 's frenziedp423plea for his services . Indeed he could not have refused , since he ' was retained by the Duke , but he had had to conquer a deep reluctance . Ile had entirely avoided Katherine since the day in the courtyard by the falcon mew , and pleading his own ill health , had spent more and more time in his cell at Grayfriars in town , leaving the routine care of the Duke 's meinie to two secular leeches . He had been troubled with no more wicked dreams of Katherine since the one in which she had been linked with disaster , and he wished to for- , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done his duty by Blanchette and treated Katherine with rigid impersonalityduring the girl 's illness , but he had been forced to admire the mother 's devotion . Tonight he saw that Katherine was as pale and listless as her daughter and while he looked at Blanchette 's tongue and felt the slow pulse in her neck , he spoke in a warmer voice than usual . " Lady Swynford , we shall have you ailing too , if you do n't take care . I 'll brew you some parsley water , and , " he glanced around Blanchette 's chamber , " this place holds unhealthful miasmas . Now the lass is better , I think you should move . " Katherine looked up , pleased by his kindly tone , and said eagerly , " To Kenilworth ? But sure she 's not well enough yet for that ? " " No , " said the friar frowning . " I meant that you might move to another chamber , one with more air and light . " Katherine nodded thoughtfully and after a moment said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those apartments are by far the most comfortable . " And I , she thought , will sleep in the Avalon Chamber again . In the ruby velvet bed where she had passed so many ecstatic nights , and where John would seem nearer to her . She was aware at once of the friar 's withdrawal . He said stiffly , " There are many other rooms at the Savoy . " Blanchette too stirred and said in her weak little voice , " Oh Mama  --  do n't let 's leave here . " " Sweet heart , ' twill do you good , " said Katherine briskly . " There are beautiful tapestries for you to look at , I 'll tell you stories about them and you can watch the boats on the Thames , and there 's the Duke 's collection of little ivory saints  --  you 'll like to play with them . " Blanchette drew her breath in , and Katherine realized that it was the first time the Duke 's name had been mentioned since the girl 's illness , yet surely all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her . She was reassured when Blanchettemurmured , " As you will , Mama . " Brother William frowned , but there was nothing he could say . The Duke 's suite was certainly the most comfortable accommodation in the palace . " Please sit down and sup with us , " said Katherine gently . " You seem wan yourself , good Brother . There 's no fresh sickness about , I hope . " " No more than usual , " said the Gray Friar . " No new fevers at any rate . Ay , I am awearied . " He sat down abruptly . " I 'll take some wine . " For months now there had been a gnawing in his stomach , but he did not bother to give himself remedies , he simply fasted more stringently and ignored it . Katherine 's ring of the hand bell was answered somewhat tardily by a servant she had never seen before , a pimply gat-toothed youth with scabs on his scalp . The points of his hose were untied and his blue and white livery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said surveying the uncouth servant with disapproval . " Piers be took wi ' a colic , " answered the lad staring at the ceiling . " So I come in his stead . I be called Perkin . What 's your wish , m'lady ? " Katherine was slightly disturbed . Lately since Blanchette no longer required her every thought she had noticed a subtle unrest amongst the varlets , nothing so crude as insolence , but slight deviationsfrom the smooth level of service she was accustomed to . The Savoy had been left with a skeleton staff , since the vast army of servants required to wait on the Duke and his retainers naturally moved with them from castle to castle . Katherine 's own servants had traveled to Kenilworth with Hawise and the little Beauforts , and none of the family remained at the Savoy . Elizabeth had gone to visit her mother-in-law , the Countess of Pembroke ; the Lady Philippa was spending three months of retreat with the nuns at Barking Abbey ; Henry divided his time between his little wife 's ancestral de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her own Tom Swynford was now formally attached to Henry 's retinue . The Savoy 's ordinary maintenance staff was therefore ample for the needs of Katherine and Blanchette , but it seemed to her that this had grown uncommonly lax . She gave the scabheaded Perkin the order for meat and wine and determined to question the chamberlain about the servants ,  |p425when  Brother William , who had been examining the lad intently , said , " Since I 'm here , I 'll have a look at this Piers ' colic . Where does he lodge ? " Perkin 's eyes shifted to the Gray Friar and he said , " No need of that , Sir Friar , ' t is but the common gripes . " " Where is he now ? " repeated the friar , fixing his stern gaze on the reddening face . " How should I know , sir ? " said the lad sullenly . " He maught be lying in t ' kitchen passage , or he maught 've ta'en his pallet to the ; cellars , or he maught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errand of his own ? " said the friar with chill emphasis . The lad thrust out his underlip and did not answer , then seeing that there were to be no more questions , disappeared quickly . " What did you mean by that ? " asked Katherine frowning . " The varlets ca n't leave the castle wards without permission . " " There 's a deal being done just now without permission , " said the friar dryly . " There 's rioting in Kent . " " What sort of riots ? " asked Katherine after a moment . " Is it the poll tax again ? " " That and other grievances , all most ably dinned into the peasantsby a priest called John Ball . " " But he 's in gaol ! " she cried . " My lord told me so and said the commons were quieting down . " The friar crossed his lean shanks , and resting his gaunt tonsured head against the chair back said with patience , " He was in gaol , but the Kentishmen have released him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex too , I hear . " Katherine thought of the russet-clad preacher she had seen at Leicester and the pounding ridiculous couplet the mob had chanted , and felt again a vague apprehension , though not of any personal danger , for rioting in Kent seemed nearly as remote as fighting in France . And it was not , thank God , like that black night in ' seventysixwhen the people of London had gone mad with rage against Percy and the Duke . This seemed to her a matter of diffused and wearisome theory , and she had learned by now that there were always malcontents about . " But what is it that the commons want ? " she said impatiently . " Or rather , " she amended , for well she knew the impossible things that the human heart could want , " what is it , in sanity , that they can hope to get by their riots ? " The friar raised his lids and looked at her . He smiled faintly.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
