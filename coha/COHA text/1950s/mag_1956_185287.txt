For generations the brothers Parker and other enterprising gamesters have been cluttering U.S. living rooms with " board games ' " derived mostly from the ancient Indian game pachisi , all the games having in common the goal of reaching a desired haven by avoiding obstacles strewed along the way . <P> Last week a children 's game in the Parker manner was sweeping Communist Hungary . Called The Road to Peace , it requires each player to move a Picasso dove around the board until it reaches a center spot marked " Peace . " A throw of the dice that lands the player in a Red City ( i.e. , cities in the Soviet bloc , plus Tunis and Guatemala ) earns him an extra turn . Green Cities ( London , Paris , Caracas , etc. ) carry a penalty of one turn . But woe betide the player who lights on a Black City , for he must promptly leave the game altogether . The one Black City on the board : Washington , D.C.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
