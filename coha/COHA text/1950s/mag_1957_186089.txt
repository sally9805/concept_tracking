Ten months that shook the soviet empire have passed since the last announced Moscow meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party . Yet to hear the Committee tell it last week as it wound up five solid days of deliberations , all they had really talked about was the current state of the Russian economy . <P> The economic balance sheet drawn up by the Committee began with the cheery news that in 1956 Russia had increased production of capital goods 11% and that of consumer goods 9% . " An idea of the scope of Soviet industrial production , " crowed Pravda , " can be gained from the fact that by the end of 1956 the Soviet Union will have smelted 49 million tons of steel , mined about 430 million tons of coal , produced 84 million tons of oil , and generated 192 billion kw-h of electricity . " * <P> Then the Committee got to the red ink . Despite increases over 1955 , production of steel , coal , cement and timber in 1956 did not reach the goals set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , scowled the Committee , " the plans for housing have been only partly fulfilled , " which was a soft way of saying that Russia 's desperate housing situation is in terrible shape . <P> Out of Bounds . The trouble , huffed the Committee , was the failure of Soviet planners to stay within the bounds of " the real possibilities of securing enough material and financial resources for fulfillment of the plans .

The new planner is scholarly looking First Deputy Premier Mikhail Pervukhin , 52 , who has risen high as an industrial manager ( the approved biographies , which always make top Reds humble sons of the proletariat , list him as a blacksmith 's son , which he may or may not be ) . <P> The Central Committee took the unprecedented step of sending the Sixth Five Year Plan back to the planners with demands for revision of unrealistic targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and curtailment of the number of construction projects . " Carefully unmentioned was the fact that the Polish and Hungarian revolts had created unexpected new drains on Russia 's resources , especially coal . <P> New Voices . It was hard to believe that in five days the 133 members of the Central Committee failed to take up such a pertinent topic as the spreading ferment of discontent in the universities . In Kiev and Azerbaijan , reported the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda , students were in an " unhealthy state of mind , " and at the Leningrad Technological Institute they indulged in " brash and demagogic remarks " that showed " an effort to ignore completely the undoubted gains of Soviet culture . " In Moscow , where university students openly admitted listening to Western radio broadcasts , the youthful audience at a Lenin Library lecture walked out in disgust at the speaker 's lame explanations of events in Hungary . Simultaneously , there appeared in the capital anonymous mimeographed " newspapers , " which were obviously written by intellectuals , and which charged that the Soviet government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
