At 54 , Bascom Giles was a prosperous businessman and a durable politician , well known all over Texas . A nourishing real-estate operator , he was past grand master of the Grand Lodge of Texas , Ancient and Accepted Order of Freemasonry , and a prominent and popular figure in the state government at Austin . Texas ' land commissioner for 16 years , he was re-elected for the eighth time last year , but disqualified himself and astonished his friends when he refused to take the oath of office . Last week in a courtroom in Austin , Bascom Giles was convicted as an accomplice to the theft of $6,800 and sentenced to three years in the penitentiary . <P> Open Invitation . The tribulations of Bascom Giles are part of the vast and complex land scandals which have rocked the state ( TIME , March 7 ) and cost the taxpayers an estimated $10 million . The scandals revolve around the Texas land program , a 1946 amendment to the state constitution that authorized $100 million in public funds to enable veterans to buy land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or farm land for a 5% down payment , with 40 years to pay off the balance . The state furnished the unpaid balance and held title until the veteran had retired the loan . <P> In land-proud Texas , the program ( conceived and largely written by Bascom Giles ) seemed a fine policy , enabling many a young man to become a landowner , and providing a much more enduring bonus for war service than cash . But the loosely written law and the $100 million were an open invitation to racketeers and grafters . <P> Soon , land promoters and dishonest public servants were waxing fat at the expense of the veterans and the taxpayers , with an ingenious racket . The racketeers 1 ) got options on land at market prices , 2 ) duped veterans into signing the necessary papers , 3 ) with the aid of crooked officials , got the land appraised at several times its actual worth , 4 ) put on pressure to get state loans on it , in the names of the bamboozled veterans , and 5 ) pocketed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Veterans Land Board , composed of Giles , Governor Allan Shivers and Attorney General John Ben Shepperd , eased the way by hastening its approval of the hot transactions , often acted so expeditiously that the promoters were able to pick up the options with the state 's money . The fact that Shivers and Shepperd rarely attended board meetings undoubtedly helped Giles work out his plan . Usually the ex-servicemen had no idea what they were signing . Many thought the papers were some sort of application for a cash bonus . <P> Unclosed Case . At Giles ' trial , witnesses told how B. R. Sheffield , a professional promoter and former business associate of Giles , had bought Rosenow Ranch , a scraggly , 10,114-acre tract in Kinney County , Texas for $162,500 , sold it to the state a year later for $353,000 . Giles admitted he had raised the state appraiser 's valuation of the land $5 an acre . L. V. Ruffin , a Brady real-estate dealer , testified that he had traveled in Sheffield 's Cadillac to California , Mexico , Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moved out of Texas .
