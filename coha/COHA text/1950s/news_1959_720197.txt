txt Republican legislators greeted Governor Rockefeller 's tax increase program today like small boys faced with a giant spoonful of nasty medicine . They did not like the taste of it and they were net sure it was going to do them any good , but they believed that they would probably have to swallow it anyway . The thirty-four Senators and ninety-two ' Assemblymen of the majority sat in stony silence for fifty-two minutes as the Governor outlined the financial program that would bring in $275,000,000 more in taxes from their constituents . Only once , when Mr. Rockefeller misspoke and called the poor the rich , did his audience respond audibly , with a muffled titter . When he had finished , the lawmakers rose and gave him a twenty-second round of applause . But as they filed out of the Assembly chamber ? on their way to a second closed briefing session with the Governor ? many of the Republican legislators were grumbling about how // unpopular the tax increases were going to make them at home . " I do n't like these tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we do about it ? " one Assembly/. man asked . " If we only had time to educate , our people on the need , " another Republican said . " But I 'm getting snowed under with angry letters even before the official announcement . " There were very few Repub. licans , however , ready to say that they would vote against the higher taxes . A number said frankly that they had voted in the past to create and expand expensive state programs and that the time had come to settle the account . Democrats Critical The Democrats had no such problems . As expected , they flailed away at Mr. Rockefeller in statements , concentrating on the amount of new taxes he sought and the revised exemption system . The Rockefeller Administration has assumed that it would get no help from the Democrats and would have to assemble the necessary 30 Senate and 76 Assembly votes from the Republican majorities of- thirty-four and ninety-two , respectively . The Democratic State Chairman , Michael H. Prendergast , said that the State had embarked on " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In submitting his $2,041,000,000 budget , Mr. Prendergast declared , the Governor is only " seeking to justify a monumental tax grab . " The Democratic minority leaders , Senator Joseph Zaretzki of Manhattan and Assemblyman Anthony J. Travia of Brooklyn served notice that their members would vote against the revision of the income tax exemption system proposed by Mr. Rockefeller . They said it would increase taxes in the lower income brackets by 25 to 411/2 per cent , After the Governor had read his budget message , the Republicans filed to his office . There , first steps were taken to eliminate the potential nucleus of a Republican tax rebellion . The five-man delegation from Onandaga ( Syracuse ) County , which had opposed the increased gasoline tax last month , indicated that it would accept the income tax program on certain terms . The Syracuse lawmakers reported that they would probably be able to support the tazc program if the Governor , or at least one of the Republican legislative leaders , made a special trip to their home territory and explained the financial situation to the citizenry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most important labor leaders to dinner in the Executive Mansion , where he plied them with hospitality and Administration doctrine on higher taxes . But hours before his guests arrived , the New York State Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations had issued a statement , charging Mr. Rockefeller with tightening " the taxation stranglehold around the necks of the people . " After the dinner , however , several of the labor leaders said they had never seen the labor statement and indicated that they thought the Rockefeller tax program might be inevitable . Several of the union officials reportedly urged Mr. Rockefeller to give them enough time to make the situation clear to their membership . Given this , they indicated , organized labor might provide the Governor with a different reaction than Democratic , doctrine dictated . The Citizens Public Expenditure survey , a private taxpayers ' group , blamed Mr. Rockefeller both for taking more money away from the people in taxes and for spending more on the Government .               @ @ @ @ @ @
