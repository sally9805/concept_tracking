txt ARMY WILL STUDY CASE OF EX-MAJOR EARTHY ACCUSED Dentist Promoted , Honorably Discharged Had Invoked the Fifth Amendment 1Stevetes ' letter to McCarthy is printed on . Page 8. 31211. , ** . C.X .. TE1 , Robert T. Stevens , Secretary of the Army , has ordered an investigation to determine whether there was subversive collusion or conspiracy in the recent promotion and honorable discharge of Maj. Irving Peress , an Army dentist . The Secretary has also set up new rules to make a repetition of the Peress affair impossible , he said . Dr. Peress , who lives at 61-39 79th Street , Elmhurst , Queens , was separated from the Army at Camp Kilmer , N. J. , Feb. 2 . This was shortly after he had invoked the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution at a closed hearing before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations . The Fifth Amendment provides that a witness in any criminal case can not be compelled to give testimony against himself . It has been interpreted by the courts to protect witnesses before Congressional committees from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to criminal prosecution . At an open hearing here yesterday of the same committee , presided over by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , Republican of Wisconsin , Dr. Peress again invoked the Fifth Amendment . He declined to answer thirty-three questions about Communist activities and connections . One sought to learn whether he had tried to recruit soldiers into the CommuInist party . Policewoman Testifies The committee also heard testimony in open session yesterday from Miss Ruth Eagle , a New York City policewoman . She said she had served as ' an undercover agent in the Communist party for two and a half years after 1944 . She declared she had known Irving Peress and his wife Elaine as Communists , and him as a liaison officer between his Communist cell and the American Labor party . Secretary Stevens ' actions in the Peress case were disclosed in a letter from him to Senator McCarthy . The letter was made public at the end of the hearing by John G. Adams , the Army Department 's chief counsel , who attended the hearing in the United States Courthouse at Foley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissions would not be given when loyalty data were refused , and honorable discharges would not be given after refusal to answer questions properly put by Congressional // committees . He conceded that the Army 's system for screening out undesirables had broken down - in the Peress case . He also acknowledged , as Senator McCarthy has contended , that Dr. Peress should not have been promoted from captain to major while under investigation . Last night Senator McCarthy declared that the Peress case would not be closed " until each and every Army officer who took part in giving an honorable discharge to a Fifth Amendment Communist is exposed . " He spoke at the forty-fourth annual dinner of the Traffic Club of New York , Inc. , at the Commodore Hotel , attended by 2.500 persons . Mr. McCarthy said he had written to Secretary Stevens " asking for the court-martial of the ( former ) . major and everyone who was instrumental in his promotion , knowing he was a Communist , and everybody who knew he was a Communist and did not bring it to your attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to talk action against those who promoted Dr. Peress , if the investigation warranted it . Senator Decries Letter But the Secretary 's letter aroused Senator McCarthy 's ire . in two respects . Whereas the Secretary said the Army did not have enough facts to court-martial Dr .. Peress , the Senator earlier in the day called this a " completely incorrect statement " and insisted it had had ample facts since last April . Senator McCarthy also took issue with a phrase- in the Secretary 's letter referring to " discrimination for political beliefs . " The Senator termed this phrase " Communist jargon " and said the Issue was not political beliefs but participation in a. criminal conspiracy to destroy the'nation and its Constitution . He said the letter contained " double-talk " and " evasion . " Senator McCarthy reiterated previous praise of Secretary Stevens and said he must have been misinformed or have merely signed a letter written by others . He suggested these might- have been " holdover press agents from the previous Administration . " Interrupting the testimony several times to demand action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCarthy called on him to produce within twentyfour hours the names of all Army personnel concerned in Dr. Peress ' discharge . If he does not get them , he asserted , he intends to go on the Senate floor and ask for contempt citations against those responsible for withholding them . He referred to " this fantastic , shameful situation . " He also demanded the presence before his committee of the officer who signed Dr. Peress ' discharge paper and whoever had been responsible for what he termed " discrepancies " in the dentist 's Army file . ' Why Was He Promoted ? ' " This Fifth Amendment Communist got a hurry-up honorable discharge after I had written Secretary Stevens asking he be court-martialed , " said Senator McCarthy . " The Army has evidence that he was a member of the Communist party , that he took a false oath when he swore he was not , that he refused to answer questions from this committee and from the Army . " Why was he promoted last November and given an honorable discharge this month . when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party leader ? " At a closed hearing after the public hearing , Senator McCarthy ordered Mr. Adams , Brig . Gen. Ralph W. Zwicker , Commandant at Camp Kilmer , and other officers on the general 's staff , out of the hearing room . Asked why he had done so , he said he had thought it a good idea . From Army sources it was learned that the exclusion tookI place after Mr. Adams had rea demand from the Senator to be sworn in and give testimony as a witness . Mr. Adams was reported to have raid he could not because he was present as ' Secretary Stevens ' personal representative . " Disgraceful Performance " Senator McCarthy said a lieutenant colonel from Camp Kilmer had refused to give certain information about the Peress case on the ground that he could be court-martialed if be did . General Zwicker also testified . " There was a disgraceful performance today but I intend to find out who waeresponsible for covering up a Fifth Amendment Communist who was an officer in the Army , " said Senator McCarthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open hearing Tuesday morning . " I have also asked the Army to produce its adjutant general , Maj. Gen. William E. Bergin. as a witness . It is up to Secretary Stevens to correct this situation quickly . He should take a new look at the top of the team to see Whether this type of coddling of Communists will continue . " Senator McCarthy announced he intended to turn over the record of the Peress case , " including obviously false affidavits. " to the Justice Department with a view to criminal prosecution for false swearing in his Army papers . He also said he would ask Congress to cite the dentist for contempt for improperly invoking the Fifth Amendment in refusals to answer seven questiqns In these seven cases after the witness declined to answer Senator McCarthy ordered him to answer and warned him he was not protected by the Fifth Amendment , but the witness each time persisted in his refusal . Roy M. Cohn , chief counsel to the committee , advised Senator McCarthy that in some of the seven questions the witness had forfeited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same area of inquiry at the closed session .
