He was simultaneously suspended from the Police Department without pay . , Lieutenant Reilly , whose pay was $89 a week , had testified he had borrowed $6,000 in two installments of equal amounts from Gustave Wagner , Queens bowling alley proprietor , and had paid some of the money back to Wagner .

In Manhattan , General Sessions Judge John A. Mullen refused to reduce the $100,000 bail set for Harry Richards , who is being held as a material witness and supposed " front man " for Frank Erickson , well-known bookmaker . Erickson 's bank account in a Broadway bank was in the name of H. Richards , Erickson told a Senate Committee in Washington a week ago . Frederick Kaplan , attorney for Richards , engaged in a lively argument with Assistant District Attorney Alfred J. Scotti in court before Judge Mullen , with Mr. Scotti telling the court that " this man had the nerve in my office to threaten me : " He quoted Mr.1 Kaplan as saying " You 'll regret the action you 're taking . " Mr. Kaplan retorted that Mr. Scotti had tried to intimidate him , and contended that Richards was being questioned improperly . " The proper place to ask questions of this man is before a grand jury , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Scotti shouted back . Mr , Kaplan told the court that when Richards was taken on Monday to the Empire Trust Company , 580 Fifth Avenue , where he had a safe deposit box , the District Attorney 's investigators told him to open the box . " Nothing was in the box , " Mr. Kaplan said . Judge Mullen asked Richards if anything had been done to compel him to answer questions or do anything he did n't want to do , and Richards admitted nothing of the kind had taken place , except that he had been " ignored when I told them I 'd like to have my attorney . " Judge Mullen then rejected the motion for bail reduction .
