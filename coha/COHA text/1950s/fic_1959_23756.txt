" It 's a disgrace for the Huily . " " I warned you this would happen , " said the man . " There 's nothing we can do now . I warned you .

" It 's been nothing but aggravation with him , " said Joshua 's wife . " We 're through . He nearly gave me a heart attack tonight .

" Send him away , he 's better off . " I returned to the interviewing room . Joshua was now sitting silently , almost motionless on a wooden chair . He was leaning forward on his hands , and he seemed , sitting there drawn up into himself , somehow older than he had moments before . " They 're gone ? " he asked quietly , looking up at me . " Yes . " " No one stayed ? " " They 're all worn out , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " For them to sleep eight hours is everything . Personally , I think life is better with open eyes . " Joshua sat still then , looking at the floor . He did not speak again . I tried to question him further , but he did not answer other than to look at me once and say , " So what 's to be ? " What was to be was exactly my problem at that moment . It was obvious that Joshua had been extremely excited . Whether this was a quick eruption , violent , and now spent , or whether this was the onset of some longer illness , I had no way of knowing . But it was certain that the family would not welcome his return that night . I told hint that I would have to admit him to the hospita I. " This I expected , " said Joshua .

Two male aides took his clothes and possessions . and after dressing bins in the tradition-il blue hospital pajamas , escorted him to the ward . He did not protest , even when the big key turned in the strong lock . T HE next morning , when I entered the ward , I found Joshua arguing with another patient , a schizophrenic young man who felt pursued by twelve red devils . " A man like you should be so superstitious , it 's disgraceful , " said Joshua . " I get messages , " said the young man . " True is true , and I hear the truth . It 's the transmission of the senses . They talk to me . " " Let them talk . You do n't have to listen .

Tell them This head I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . " What I could make finally of Joshua 's story was this : He had a granddaughter of twenty who was shy and knew few young men . Determined to improve her social life , Joshua contacted a marriage broker who arranged a date for the girl . The arrangement was a success and after a brief courtship , the girl announced her engagement . It was at this point that Joshua became so perturbed that he was escorted to the hospital , where I came upon him struggling with his civil rights . " What was it that upset you so much about the engagement ? " I asked . " Gevalt . And you are supposed to be a psychiatrist ? Understanding you 've got about as much as Goldman , the marriage broker , that thief . He advertises scientific introductions . For a scientific introduction I paid and what did I get ? An introduction to an anachronism , a man from out of the middle ages , a rabbinical student . " " You did n't care for the young man ?

A character like this , he studies for years how to marry a young girl , she should support him while he reads every day two lines from the Talmud . " " But your granddaughter seemed happy ? " " What she knows from life , I could write everything on the fingernails of one hand . From scientific introductions , I expected she should get a scientist , what else ? A man with a little forward look . A chemist , a biologist , a doctor  --  at worst  --  a psychiatrist . What did she get ? A blue heard , with such a drooping black coat even in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . " I attempted to obtain an account of Joshua 's background and family history , but he ignored most of my questions . However when I inquired about his past hospitalization , he seemed suddenly attentive and embarrassed . " In a hospital ? Once , yes . Nothing serious . " " What was the matter ? " " I tell you it was nothing . I got a little mixed up , that 's all . " " In what way ? " " For a while , I got into my head a foolish thought . Would you believe it ? I thought mywife , Esther , was making me horns with another man . I nearly forgot it already , such an idea . My wife was already past fifty then , and throwing no aspersions against her , but she looked like sixty-five . " " How long were you away ? " " I do n't know exactly . A few months maybe .

The first visiting day already , when I took a look at my wife 's figure , I was cured . " Usually such information would alter considerably my diagnostic impression . Joshua had been in a mental hospital with an apparently bona fide paranoid picture . Nevertheless , despite the history , I was convinced that Joshua was not now psychotic . I decided to keep him in the hospital only until his agitation had completely disappeared . I protested . Last night , they put in my room , he has to sleep right next to me , this Rabbi . I could burst . What is this , a test , a punishment ? Probably the only person in the world I absolutely could become insane from living together in the same room with is a Rabbi . So who is my roommate ? This Rabbi Fineman , also a little crazy , and a terrible snorer into the bargain . From such a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew nothing about it , Joshua , " I said . " I guess the nurses did not realize how you felt . " " They knew , they knew . If they did n't know , I told them plenty . What is the world already so decayed , there is no religious freedom ? I got to live practically right on top of superstition and ignorance , not to mention the music through the nose all night ? " As soon as I could , I spoke to the chief nurse and explained Joshua 's case to her . She understood and moved the Rabbi out . In his place she 54 THE LEFT FIELDERS put a chronic alcoholic who had given up religion long ago . Still the friction did not disappear . Whenever I came upon Joshua he was in an argument with the Rabbi . On the ward , in the recreation room , at occupational therapy , they seemed always to be in a bitter fight . Rabbi Fineman was seventy-eight . Retired from the pulpit after fifty years at one synagogue , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a mild confusional state anti some loss of memory for recent events . Without family and financial resources , he had been placed in a city nursing home . There he had lived for two years . In that time , he had been a model patient , quiet , easily managed . Despite his circumscribed memory deficit , he knew nearly all the prayers he had learned as a rabbinical student , anti he regularly conducted services at the home . Recently , however , the Rabbi had been having somewhat greater difficulty following ward routine . He had missed several meals , having forgotten the time , and once or twice he had dressed himself in the middle of the night , believing it was morning . The superintendent of the nursing home , alarmed , had packed him off , promptly , to the hospital . With him had come a brief note stating that the Rabbi had become completely unmanageable , and that city law forbade a nursing home to care for a psychotic patient . It was a case of panic , nothing more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to continue to live comfortably at the home , instead of being imprisoned in a psychiatric ward . But there was no use arguing . I had found that out long ago . I could have argued forever . They would still have said he was out of his mind , and a danger to society . S 0 I had Joshua , and I had the Rabbi , and I had endless days and nights of aggravation . Try as I might , it seemed impossible to keep them apart . I warned Joshua away from the Rabbi , pointing out the threat to his ravaged ego of such masochistic behavior , but he dismissed the idea . " Listen , about me you should n't worry . Such crazy ideas like this Rabbi 's got , they do n't rub of on an educated man in the twentieth century . What , do you think if some lunatic on a wooden box tells me tomorrow is the end of the world , I got to go right away and pack my suitcase ? " Still I was worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the john , during meals , they would assault each other with insults carefully planned and nourished . " Listen , Rabbi , " Joshua would say at dinner , " the kosher food you ate all your life , it kept you sane ? " " To ear such food nourishes not only the body , Mr. Liebstine , but about such things a Philistine from the Bronx would n't know . " " So what did it do for you ? Instead of being a lunatic , plain and simple , you got a kosher psychosis . Mazzeltov . Maybe in the state hospital , I could arrange for you a nice roommate , a crazy fellow I know , a rabbinical student with a blue beard . You could pray for each other . " " But for your disease , there is no hospital at all . Such ignorance is incurable . " " And if you 're lucky , " said Joshua , " maybe in the state hospital , they 'll give you a skull cap . When you forget to put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Clothes I may forget , true . But without my pants , I 'm better off than a man without religion . Mr. Liebstine . " For a month before they left the hospital , the smalharms war continued with attack and counterattack , along the con-idors of the ward and on the hospital grounds . Their behavior became disturbing to the ward . Moving their battlefield to the concrete dimensions of the chessboard , they played continually , long into the night , match after bitter match , alternating strategic moves with strategic insults , and ignoring the nurse with her tray of sleeping medication and threats of needles . On recreation walks , they would disappear together , and a search party would have to be organized . We would scour the grounds , finding them at last , the pitch of their voices betraying their presence . Then we would bring them back from the secluded patch of earth to which they had retreated to fight in peace . The chief of the psychiatric service , receiving word of the administrative problems for which Joshua and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition of their cases . " There 's only one spot for old fellows like this , " he said . " There 's no use trying to find another place for them . They 're state hospital material , and the sooner we send them there , the better . " As far as the Rabbi was concerned , I could see no alternative but state hospitalization . No nursing home in the city would accept him . Without family or money , there was no hope of a private hospital . He would have to live the remainder of his life in a state mental institution . But in Joshua 's case , the situation was different . He had a family that could take him back . True , he had been through a psychotic break but this had occurred years before and since there was nothing now to suggest a recurrence of the illness , I felt that with a little patience he could be managed at home . The family disagreed . Angrily , articulately disagreed . Joshua had visitors just once . On the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , his wife , sister , and brother-in-law came to the ward . They spent a few minutes with him , talking loudly , and then descended on my office . " What do you plan to do with him , Doctor ? " his wife asked . " He ca n't come home . " " Why is that , Mrs. Liebstine ? " " He 's out of his mind , that 's why . He needs to be put away . " " Why do you say that ? " " Why ? Just live one day with him and soon you 'll know why . He talks day and night out of his mind . All the time he 's mumbling about freedom . For him in the whole world , there 's not enough freedom . Can you imagine ? Freedom to think , he complains he 's got none , but freedom to sit like a king and make every minute pronouncements , let me tell you he has plenty . Also to eat eight times a day he manages to be free enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this he would n't move his behind from the chair . All right , he means well , this I know , but what ran you do with a man like this ? He 's a mental case . You 'll have to send him away . Let him live in a hospital . It 's the best thing . " I told the family that there was no reason medically to send Joshua to a state hospital , but they were adamant . " No , " said Mrs. Liebstine , " I 'm finished . He 's gotten to be a regular lunatic . My granddaughter 's fianc ? he nearly scared away with such insults on religion , I thought the poor girl will faint . Me he once already accused I 'm taking into my bed a gigolo . Enough is enough . If you do n't send him away , I 'll get a lawyer . " I tried to explain about Joshua , to show them that his behavior was defensive , that it grew out of fear and loneliness , but it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told them that it was their right to petition through the court to have Joshua committed , but that as his doctor , 1 would oppose it . T H F. went through with it . The family obtained a lawyer , and a court hearing was scheduled for the following week . In the meantime , I had begun the disposition of the Rabbi 's case . I explained to him that he would be sent to a state hospital . There was no other alternative . Then I tried to describe the advantages of such an institution , its spacious grounds , its opportunities for recreation , all the things I had been taught to say to patients who were to be committed . During my speech , the Rabbi said nothing . He sat quietly , watching me , listening . When I had finished he only nodded and walked out of the office . That night . however , when I was making rounds , I heard him in his room talking to Joshua . " What could 1 have clone ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . The only thing is , I wish there was some other place for me . A place with people more my ' kind . I do n't make friends so easily . " " You 're a fool , " said Joshua . " I always said it , and now I 'll tell you plain . You live in left field , way out by the bleachers . For fifty years you study all kinds of rules and regulations how to get into Heaven , so in the end you end up in Hell . " " Perhaps I did wrong somewhere along the line . " " Did wrong ? What did you do ? You stole from the congregation ? You slept with the cantor 's wife ? The trouble is you ( lid nothing wrong . You could n't even have that satisfaction . It 's not you , Rabbi .

Tell the doctor you demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to me and requested a hearing . I notified the court and the Rabbi 's case was placed on the agenda , to be heard on the same day as Joshua 's . It rained the clay of the hearings , a steady downpour which let up only late in the afternoon ? when the court had adjourned . There were perhaps twenty people present , Joshua 's relatives and their attorney comprising the largest segment in the small room . The remainder of the group was made up of employees of the court and a handful of doctors . Judge Hornlin , the presiding juror , was a veteran of the bench , who had conducted many commitment hearings . Privately the psychiatric residents had diagnosed him as a case of pathological narcissism . Untrained in psychiatry , he nevertheless fancied himself a psychiatrist , and he routinely conducted what he termed a psychiatric examination of any patient certified for commitment . On the basis of his findings , the judge had sent a good many severely ill schizophrenics home . At other times he had committed individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed them to ix psychotic and dangerous to the community . While his decisions regularly frustrated and outraged me to the point of contemplated homicide , I was not unhappy this particular afternoon to see Judge Hornlin take his place on the bench , for I felt that his peculiar nature might favor Joshua 's cause . The Rabbi 's case was heard first , and even for Judge Hornlin there could be no question about the decision . I presented the Rabbi 's predicament and the judge . after interviewing him briefly , committed him . " I 'm sorry , Rabbi , " said the judge . " I join you in wishing that other facilities were available for a case such as yours , but there is clearly no alternative . You are to go to a state hospital . " The Rabbi was led away , and Joshua 's case called . Then , for the next hour , I fought with Joshua 's family and their lawyer . I presented my report to the court , explaining that after psychiatric examination , I found no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseshoe baldness and a shining scalp , countered with examples of Joshua 's behavior at home , which , he claimed , provided clear evidence of a deranged mind , technicalities be damned . Joshua 's relatives testified to the unbearable anguish his bizarre behavior had caused them . The granddaughter was brought in and she testified to the humiliation she had suffered as the result of Joshua 's interference in her life . Her fianc ? , the rabbinical student , pulled down his trousers to show a bruise inflicted by Joshua 's foot . The attorney made much of the last history of mental illness , recounting in detail Joshua 's paranoid behavior and thinking . Finally Judge Hornlin called Joshua before him to he examined . " Mr. Liebstine , how do you feel ? " asked the judge . " Which part of me are you interested in ? " said Joshua . " I 'm a man of many parts . You heard it . I 'm sometimes a ferocious tiger . " " But how do you feel now ? " " Wait . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , you know , Judge . I hear the truth . It 's the transmission of the senses . " " You hear something ? " " Do n't you ? I 'm surprised . I thought you were a member of the club . All right . I 'll translate . Today I feel up and down , in and out . That 's the latest official report . " " I 'm afraid I do n't understand . " Judge Hornlin looked perturbed . " Up for commitment , down to Hades . In a prison , out of a prison . Sane or insane , which is which ? " The judge was staring at me . The attorney was smiling . " Mr. Liebstine , " said Judge Hornlin , " I 'm having trouble following you . " " Why are you following me ? Are you judge or jury , or Mr. Hoover ? " Judge Hornlin shifted in his seat . Joshua 's wife was smiling faintly . I sat in silence , mesmerized . " Mr. Liebstine , " said the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believes you sane . Do you agree with him ? " " Sane in an insane land , or insane in a sane world . Choose sides . I 'm a man without a home , without a country . Maybe you 'll give me a passport ? " " Frankly , you seem quite disturbed to me , Mr. Liebstine . Do you realize where you are ? " " In the space age , the psychiatric age , the regressive age . Which stop do we get off at , Judge ? " " Mr. Liebstine , " said Judge Hornlin , " were you thinking this way when you were previously hospitalized ? " " I 'm thinking this way all my life . It 's a disease I got young . " " I understand you had some disturbing ideas concerning your wife at one time . I 'd like to know how you feel about her now . " " How is it you 've got such a big interest in my wife ? Arc you the one who has been carrying on with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already when you were so anxious to follow me . Mr. Judge gigolo , eh ? Well , you picked a lemon . " Judge Hornlin turned to me . " I think we 've heard enough , Doctor , " he said . " I do n't know what this man was like when you examined him , but it is clear that he is seriously disturbed at this time . He is to be committed to a state hospital . " And Doctor , " the judge added , " please be sure of your facts before you testify before me in the future . " T H F next moment the courtroom was empty except for Joshua and the Rabbi and the aides assigned to guard them . Joshua 's family had left quickly , talking excitedly with the lawyer . The judge had signed the papers and was gone . I was unable to move . What had happened before my eyes was simply impossible . I was certain of my ground . While I sat there , Joshua came over to me . " Thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , maybe they did n't think you were so smart this afternoon . I 'm sorry . It 's just that I have n't quite finished converting that numskull of a Rabbi . You understand . " I looked at him . He smiled . For a psychiatrist , you 're not half bad , " he said . " Maybe some day you 'll he boss of the whole hospital . It would make me glad . " The aides escorted Joshua and the Rabbi outside . The door of the courtroom opened and they walked out together . I could hear Joshua 's voice in the hall . " With a genius like you around , Rabbi , " he said , " the lunatic asylum is in for a religious revival . Come on , Messiah , I 've got you checkmated . " For a long while I remained in the empty room . I wanted to be by myself . I wanted to think things over from the beginning . But somehow , all alone there , I could think of nothing but my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in my mind . How much more of life would I have to know before I could understand the needs of another human being ? Finally , tired of trying to puzzle things out , l walked into the ward . Joshua and the Rahhi were at the chess table in the day room . For a long time I watched them from a distance . They sat in one corner of the room , leaning toward each other , playing and arguing hotly , oblivious of the rest of the world , sheltered behind the strong locked door that guarded their freedom . HOWARD SIMONS THE PAIN IN EVERYBODY 'S BACK Although the slipped disc is a new fashion , it ; lethally is one of the oldest of human complaints  --  and perhaps the most frustrating for a doctor to handle . B REAT H E S there the man with soul so dead , who never to himself bath said , " My back is killing me . " Doctors doubt it . Low back pain is perhaps the most ubiquitous ailment of mankind . Whenever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . Whenever it is pondered by a member of the medical profession , it is in frustrated terms . The first surgeon I approached on the subject said , " We might as well discuss the cosmos . " A recent medical article referred to it as " that enigma of medicine . " And a progress report on orthopedic surgery published a few years ago started out with the observation : The mists of ignorance still shroud the back-pain problem . . . . " Paiii can , of course , smite any part of the back . However , the lower sectors are particularly vulnerable when measured in number of sufferers . For this reason ( and because the woes of the neck , shoulders , and upper arms are another medical story ) this report will be limited to the phenomenon known as Iow back pain . It is , in fact , a major health problem which besets practically everyone in the course of a lifetime . Nor is it likely to wait until we are bowed with years . A venerable authority on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical School , regularly asks his second-year students whether they have spent a day or more in bed because of low back trouble . More than half of them invariably say yes . Doctors are not surprised by this result . Conversely , they tend to be highlyskeptical when a fifty- or sixty-year-old patient claims to have been free from low back pain through life . Its most improbable . Crippling and distressing though it is , low back pain is seldom fatal ; many are only part-time sufferers ; infants and children escape it for the most part . In some instances it fills a need , by providing chronic complainers with a socially acceptable , hardy , and mysterious complaint . " The diagnosis of ' back pain , ' " says one surgeon , " is about as specific as ' fits ' or ' fever . ' Medicine is not in the dark about it  --  the public is . The public wants a definitive ailment . Often medicine ca n't give it to them . So they turn to chiropractors and the like . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " This widespread bafflement is understandable , for the back is a masterfully engineered con-glomerate of bone , nerve , ligament , and muscle . The backbone consists of twenty-four separate vertebrae , including from top to bottom the cervical , thoracic , and lumbar . These are connected to the sacrum which is joined to the coccyx ( a vestigial tail ) . Each vertebra is made up of a solid piece of bone and a spinal arch through which the spinal cord is threaded , much like spun silk through a needle 's eve . Each vertebra is separated from the next by a gelatinous disc . From the spinal cord two spinal nerves pass through the arch in each vertebra to serve as communicators between the brain and specific areas of the body . Muscles located on both sides and in front of the spine support the vertebrae when at rest or in motion . This is a much simplified sketch of the elaborate architecture which holds man erect and makes physical action possible .

Sometimes it is a referred pain masking an ailment at a remote spot . It can he a symptom  --  to name but a few  --  of typhoid fever or a short leg ; appendicitis or an abscessed tooth ; syphilis or a gastric ulcer ; tonsillitis or a deformed foot ; kidney trouble or a tumor ; a skeletal defect or encephalitis ; a disturbed endocrine gland or reproductive organs displaced by pregnancy ; an injury or had posture ; a ruptured disc or a figment of the imagination . One of the commonest causes is osteoarthritis , for which  --  like arthritis in general  --  very little can he done . The most popular cause today is known in medical circles as the posterior protrusion of an intervertebral disc . This is the phenomenon discussed at cocktail parties as a slipped , ruptured , herniated , or protruded disc . Although " fashionable " at the moment , the slipped disc has plagued man from time immemorial . It is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swing from branch to branch and got around otherwise on all fours . We are still designed this way although we plant our two feet squarely on the ground and stand erect . The consequence is back pain , as well as flat feet and hip trouble . Monkeys , as far as we know , escape these ills but some animals are less fortunate . Low-slung dogs , such as the dachshund , Pekingese , and basset , are victims of poor engineering and overbreeding . Because they are too long for their height , stresses are improperly applied to their weak backs . So their discs slip too . THOSE FRAGILE DISCS M A N suffers not merely from being a mis- shapen biped but because of other habits . Most animals keep their muscles flexible , live shorter lives , and do not mistreat their backs as we do . Man , on the other hand , is either overprotected or overexercised , is living longer , and abuses his back at work , at play , at rest , and asleep . Animal ailments , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two decades man has statistically discovered the protruded disc as a major contributor to his low back troubles . For example , out of two thousand persons admitted to the Mayo Clinic over a period of several years with low back ailments , one-half had either a disc protrusion or osteoarthritis . Other recent studies , both here and abroad , confirm the growing medical belief that changes of the lumbar discs together with osteoarthritisare responsible for most low back and sciatic pain . Lumbago , which plagued our forebears , is seldom mentioned today . It meant literally " a pain in the back " and described rather than diagnosed a variety of aches . The disc is made up of a circular , tough , fibrous , elastic mass known as the annulus fibrosus which houses a fiberless , jelly-like core known as the nucleus pulposus . This combination is an excellent shock absorber , cushioning the vertebrae , and preventing the brain from taking a terrible beating with each step .

But inserted into a ruptured disc , it brings on the full fury of sciatica . Medical researchers believe that when and if they fathom this sensitivity change they will be close to solving the riddle of back pain . Disc rupture is a problem of aging , though heredity may also play a part . As you grow older , you are more likely to suffer a protrusion . Aging is a local phenomenon , proceeding at different rates in various parts of the anatomy . Since the lower back ages rapidly , the disc , instead of remaining a tough , elastic band , wears out . What happens when it ruptures is analogous to a tire blowout , with the tough , outer annulus fibrosus behaving like a well-worn tire , and the jelly-like , inner nucleus pulposus like a tube . The nucleus pulposus erupts or protrudes , ruptures , slips , or herniates through the weakened wall of the annulus fibrosus .

For example , hoisting a 25- to 30-pound weight places about 1,200 to 1,500 pounds per square inch of pressure on the central part of the lumbar discs . Ironically , the stronger you are the more likely you are to suffer a rupture . Weight lifters and other athletes are prime candidates for back trouble , though not necessarily in the line of duty . For example , Rocky Marciano suffered a ruptured disc in 1949 but kept right on winning for the next six years . After his retirement in 1955 , he picked up his small daughter one evening , felt a stabbing , violent pain in his back , and had to be rushed to the hospital . A ruptured , bulging disc is in a position to endanger the two nerve roots near the spinal cord . Soft tissues around the disc often swell up and this inflammatory change irritates the
