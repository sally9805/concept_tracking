Correspondence ? Miss , Halsey 's Quarrel with Nixon SIRS ; ACCORDING to Margaret Halsey ( NR , November 10 ) , Richard M. Nixon ? a man nakedly driving for power ( presumably the power drives of Messrs . Rockefeller , Stevenson , Brown , Kennedy et al . are more decently clothed ) ? sup ( Continued on page 23 ) Withdrawal from Berlin 0N NOVEMBER 10 , Mr. Khrushchev warned that the price for free access to Berlin was going up : the West would be compelled to recognize the sovereignty of the East German regime . Two weeks of uncertainty have gone by , uncertainty not only over how the Russians would force us to pay the higher price . It has been uncertain how the West would respond . At once , the Western powers ? or as many as were prepared to do so ? should have carried the controversy into the enemy camp . The President should have led a diplomatic counter-offensive , affirming and repeating that the Russians have not withdrawn from East Germany , and that the claim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Soviets maintain 22 divisions in East Germany today , plus four more in Poland , plus an unknown number in . Hungary . At least some of these are equipped with tactical atomic weapons which the Soviets paraded before the world in Red Square ' on November 17 , 1957 . They are said , however , to have established intermediate ballistics missile sites in East Germany . It is fantastic to think of the Pankow regime as representing anything but the power of the Kremlin . We pointed out last week that the Berlin crisis has been provoked by Khrushchev at a place of his own choosing , and that he is now " trying to exploit the universal fear of war in order to ' gain a diplomatic advantage . " That advantage is consolidation of Communist power in East Germany . It is bluff and we must call it , not merely for the sake of the Berliners , but as much for the sake of East Germans who remain , involuntarily but not necessarily permanently , under Russian rule . We realize that to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at the time of the Berlin airlift , that risk should be taken . This is an opportunity for Western leadership to recall world attention to the real issue : the future of Germany . And the real solution is a united Germany in which free elections are guaranteed . If the Russians speak of withdrawal , it is our opportunity to advocate genuine withdrawal , which means acceptance by the four conquering powers of the unconditional right of all Germans to unite under leaders of their own choosing . In this situation , politically at least , the West could lead from strength , knowing ? o as do the Germans and the Russians ? that free elections would mean the termination of Communist rule in every part of Germany . As for the immediate threat to our right to enter and leave Berlin via the Autobahns ( unless we accept the sovereignty of the Pankow regime ) Washington 's answer should be unambiguous . We should not accept the pretense that the Pankow regime is independent ; we should not accept the pretense that the East German regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force is used by Moscow 's , agents to bait Berlin-bound US vehicles , our forces should shoot back . Investigating the FCC ONE OF THE first decisions which will face Sam  - -  / Rayburn and his new House Democratic majority is what to do with the 18-month-old Harris Subcommittee investigation of regulatory agencies . The Subcommittee has run through its first $300,000 and is scheduled to expire at the end of January . At times , as William Costello observed last week , the Subcommittee has " made a considerable spectacle of itself cavorting in the headlines with random cases of official misconduct . " But the headlines have at least served to publicize the character of , persons being appointed to various agencies and their questionable activities while in office . And it might even be argued that the current FCC investigations were a necessary prelude to a comprehensive study for which the public has now been prepared and which is clearly now in order . In our view Mr. Costello has demonstrated that a revitalized Harris Subcommittee should henceforth concentrate on how and why the FCC has given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service programming in radio and TV . The Subcommittee 's first counsel , Bernard Schwartz , had plans for such an investigation ; his successor , Robert Lishman , is also aware of programming deficiencies . However , the Subcommittee has only touched on this aspect of the problem , while pursuing the more dramatic but less significant indiscretions of such men as Richard A. Mack , the recently indicted former FCC commissioner , Sherman Adams and Bernard Goldfine , and now FCC ex-chairman George C. McConnaughey . It is time for the House to extend the life of the Harris Subcommittee and for the Subcommittee to move on to more substantial questions . FCC laxity is a result of the Commission 's acceptance of a broadcaster-promoted theory that the FCC should not meddle in programming unless commercial irresponsibility or threats to national security are involved . This theory is contrary to the Federal Communication Act and the idea that the " public interest , convenience and necessity " call for a close scrutiny of the performance of broadcasters before licenses are renewed . The broadcasters argue that the renewal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always a danger of a direct or indirect censorship over radio and television programs . ( What of the " censorship " by advertisers of program content ? ) And we grant also that those who obtain TV or radio licenses should not be made to feel that their franchises may he taken from them arbitrarily or for frivolous reasons . We must certainly avoid a situation in which broadcasters fear scheduling ' shows that might offend the political forces controlling the FCC . But the choice need not be between one extreme or another : There is a middle way permitting the enforcement of public interest programming and at the same time avoiding federal dictation . Penalties , short of lifting licenses , could be imposed for failure to comply with FCC programming requirements . Direct fines might be imposed , or perhaps , instead , advertising on a program might be prohibited for a stated period of time ? two weeks , three weeks , or more.1This is one way to strike at the pocketbook of the broadcaster for failing adequately to serve the public interest . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should be explored . An effective investigation would require a new appropriation of at least $500,000 so that an enlarged Subcommittee staff could conduct a sustained FCC investigation , while at the same time performing necessary lesser duties in overseeing other errant agencies . Word from the Boss A FTER READING our analysis ( Nov. 17 ) of the Pennsylvania election returns ? in which we said that the poor Democratic showing in the state was attributable in part to the Big-City-Machine look of the ticket , and to the fact that Democratic Senatorial nominee George Leader had " played ball with Philadelphia boss William Green , who is under indictment for bribery " ? Congress ? man Green telephoned , loud and clear , to set us straight . He wishes it known that : His name is William I. Green , jr . He delivered a very large Democratic vote in Philadelphia . He had some responsibility for the selection and election of Philadelphia Congressman Herman Toll ( whom we had described as " a prot ? g ? and ally of Sen. Joseph Clark and Philadelphia Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congressman Toll 's letter to The New Republic ( printed in this issue ) before the letter was mailed . And , he is not under federal indictment for bribery ; he is under federal indictment for conspiracy . " Compromise " on Cloture A s TRB notes in his wire this week , Southern Senators will probably offer to " compromise " on the Senate rules by accepting a rule permitting cloture by two-thirds of those present and voting . The " compromise " play will be quarter-backed by Lyndon Johnson and will appeal to many people who will see in it a moderate position half way between the one extreme of requiring the vote of two-thirds of the entire membership to impose cloture ( the present rule ) and the other extreme of permitting cloture by a vote of a simple majority of the Senate ( the proposal of Paul Douglas ) . But cloture by two-thirds of those present and voting is no compromise at all . It is a disguised " heads I win , tails you lose " sort of rule , providing iron-clad protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters is so intense DECEMBER 1 , 1958 that no Southern Senator who can walk or be carried will be absent from the floor during a close vote on a motion to end discussion of a civil rights bill . The Southerners can , therefore , always muster at least 20 votes from their own camp , and they can count on adding at least 13 more from among conservative Northern and Western Senators . These 33 votes are more than a third of the entire Senate membership : the certainty that they can be produced means that cloture can not be applied to a civil rights filibuster under any kind of two-thirds rule , whether it requires two-thirds of the entire Senate or only two-thirds of those present and voting . The present rule does have the slight virtue of treating all filibusters equally by barring cloture on any , and it is so patently outrageous in its terms that it constitutes a standing invitation to reform . If the Senate will not accept cloture by a majority of the members , the better course would be to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has the two defects of protecting civil rights filibusters as fully as they are protected now , and of reducing the pressure for meaningful reform . Arab Refugees THE UN General Assembly 's discussion this year of the Relief and Woiks Agency for Palestine ( UNRWA ) has produced two developments which could push the Arab refugee problem off dead center . The first has been a strong US plea that in view of the 1960 expiration date of UNRWA 's mandate , studies be authorized now to get away from the " dole " approach and toward self-support projects and the integration of refugees in the Arab host countries . This was followed by Israel 's new offer to compensate the refugees in advance of a general peace settlement . Although the offer is conditional on ( 1 ) actual integration of the refugees , and ( 2 ) the US standing by a 1955 pledge to help finance such a settlement . diplomats consider it a helpful gesture . The Arabs have unfortunately insisted that no study is needed , that it must be " repatriation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab cooperation , our delegation has dumped the problem in Secretary-General Hammarskjold 's lap . Meanwhile , there are reports of continuing contacts between Israel and leaders of the refugees . It is noteworthy that Jordanian newspapers displayed the Israeli compensation offer prominently , and one of them even cautioned Arab politicians against sacrificing the immediate , attainable interests of the refugees to any long-range , political goals . In addition to being host to more than half the nearly million refugees , Jordan also contains most of those who were well-off in old Palestine and would , therefore , benefit most from any integration-compensation agreement . Bargaining Power in Sudan F ROM EARLY evidence it appears that General Abboud 's takeover in the Sudan was designed to forestall a pro-Nasser coup which may have been brewing and which , in Abboud 's view , the politicians whom he has displaced would have been unable to prevent . The coup came after a period of weeks during which evidence mounted that all was not well in the Sudan . The coalition cabinet was showing signs of floundering in partisan politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President of the Sudanese Senate ( of the same party ) , as well as the former Premier and leader of the opposition , Ismail al-Azhari , all were meeting in Cairo with Nasser ? reportedly against the wishes of ex-Premier Khalil . Mr. Nasser 's visitors made statements in the Egyptian capital indicating that the question of the distribution of Nile waters ? the principal item of controversy between the Sudan and the United Arab Republic ? was the main subject of their talks . At the same time , Khalil was paying a visit to Ethiopia , and presumably getting the Ethiopian viewpoint on the Nile ; since the Blue Nile comes from the Ethiopian highlands , the Ethiopians are determined to have a voice in any talks on the river and to have Egypt recognize their right to increased diversions . Khalil may have been paving the way for an Ethiopian-Sudanese hypropolitical entente against Egypt . Indeed , the Sudanese coup can be said to be the direct - reverberation of Nasser 's victory in obtaining Soviet money to start building the Aswan High Dam . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . with the Russians marred by the insistence of the Sudanese that they have a right to increase their own diversion of water ? in disregard of the 1929 Nile Agreement to which the Sudanese do not feel bound . Only a strong government , secure in its position as representative of the Sudan , might stand up to the political and propaganda pressure that Nasser has exerted on Khartoum in recent weeks . General Abboud 's coup gives the Sudan such a government . THE NEW REPUBLIC There Were n't Two Sides To the Story in Phoenix SEN , BARRY GOLDWATER had more than good looks , money and a sound constitution . He had help in his campaign from someone who hates taxes and labor unions and Eisenhower Republicans as much as he does ? Eugene C. Pulliam , owner and publisher of the only two newspapers in Phoenix , The Arizona Republic ( morning and Sunday ) and the Phoenix Gazette . And since Phoenix has about half the state 's population , Mr. Pulliam helped . A brief documentation of how may explain why Barry Goldwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country succeeded in doing : running against " labor " and making it pay , pay , pay . Let us record only some of the coverage of The Republic . The Gazette story would be a duplicate . On October 9 , The Republic previewed its strategy with a. page one head : GOLDWATER LASHES COPE 'S VOTE TEST . From then on , the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education was to be tagged the " Cominittee to Cancel Out People 's Equality . " It , and not Mr. Gold-water 's Democratic opposition , became the target . On October 10 , The Republic reprinted on its front page an article from Newsweelk by Raymond Moley headlined WRITER SAYS LABOR HARD AFTER GOLDWATER . On October 15 , The Republic headlined a Goldwater charge on page one : COPE HAS $450,000 CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST . . . " to defeat him Goldwater in his campaign for reelection . " The $450,000 figure was repeated over and over again . Then , near the end of October , COPE 's preliminary report to Congress on campaign expenditures was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as suddenly and conveniently as Joe McCarthy had once dropped his first figures on the number of Communists in the State Department . In tones more shocked than before , the paper and Goldwater then announced that " a $14,000 political fund , including $1,000 earmarked specifically for Governor McFarland , was sent into Arizona by National COPE . " On October 16 , McFarland finally made the front page with a story of his own ? but above it , " piggy-back , " was a 50 percent bigger story about Goldwater . The same arrangement of stories was repeated four times . Never did McFarland get top line over Goldwater . But COPE did . On October 19 , the headline read : COPE AGENT MUSCLES IN . Below was a picture of Charles Alva Green . California labor figure , snapped in front of a downtown Phoenix restaurant , accompanied by two other mug shots of Green taken from California law enforcement files . In the body of the news story and unattributed in any way was the following paragraph : " Here in Arizona , with unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well on their way toward control of the Democratic Party , and that could be the political control of the whole state . " On October 20 , after Goldwater appeared before the Mine-Mill Union Council in Tucson , the headline on the front page of The Republic 's bulldog ( early ) edition read , UNION REJECTS GOLDWATER . Hasty revision for morning coffee readers produced a contrary head : UNION LAUDS GOLDWATER . What had happened was that the union did endorse McFarland , but had said Goldwater 's " basic honesty and sincerity " could not be doubted . On October 24 , The Republic tried a tie-in between its anti-Reuther line and an appeal to Catholic voters . As if it were a news break , it published the months-old testimony of UAW Secretary Treasurer Emil Mazey before the Senate Rackets Committee hearings . On March 6 , Mazey had referred to Kohler Company influence over " the church , the Bar and the Medical Association " in Cheboygan , Wisconsin ; cross-examined by Senator Curtis ( R , Neb. ) as to whether he meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of integrity , " Mazey had replied : " If they are controlled by the Kohler Company they could n't be . " GOLDWATER HITS UAW AIDES CLERGY ATTACK , screamed the page one head . The lead read : " A charge by a Walter Reuther top aide that every one of the Catholic clergy in a Wisconsin community lacked character and integrity brought angry comment from Senator Goldwater last night that this was typical of the ' rule or ruin ' attitude of the labor bosses . Goldwater hired all Phoenix TV channels to show by film clips the dramatic story of the Senate Rackets Committee hearings on the corruption and ruthlessness of union bosses . " And he did . On television , Goldwater utilized unidentified film clips of picket lines , fist fights , cars with bullet-riddled windows , surly men snarling at the camera , and other assorted mob scenes . The men in the pictures could have been scabs fomenting trouble at a peaceful picket line , but that did not matter . The solid home owners of Phoenix and Tucson were shown what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldwater angrily announced ( and The Republic faithfully reported ) that his elderly mother had received numerous threatening phone calls . Strange men warned her to remember the acid bath given Victor Riesel , and vowed to wreak all sorts of vengeance on her , her son , and her family . The same night , Goldwater 's campaign manager found the door to his apartment " kicked " open . To the best of his knowledge , nothing was missing . The moral was that union thugs and jackanapes would stop at nothing . But although " his campaign managers expressed fear of harm to . ? . his family , " The Republic assured its readers that Goldwater was unalarmed . Reuther 's name was invariably coupled in the press with that of the Teamsters ' Jimmy Hoffa . It was n't until the day after the election that The Republic observed with a straight face on its editorial page that there 's a " difference between the two : . . . One of Hoffa 's few virtues is that he sees labor unions as most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reuther , on the other hand , sees unionism as merely a step toward power over government . . ? . In the interests of making intelligent decisions on public affairs , it is important to remember the difference . " On October 31 , McFarland , for the first time , got a front-page story while Goldwater did not : MAC DRAGS MC CARTHY INTO CAMPAIGN . In a TV speech , McFarland had briefly mentioned the late Wisconsin Senator . Eighty percent of The Republic 's article was devoted to the McCarthy bit , complete with background material . On the last Sunday of the campaign , Mac passed up a rally at which Goldwater appeared , in favor of a meeting and TV show . The Republic crowed on November 3 , one day before the election , that " MAC MISSES FINAL RALLY , " implying that Mac either lacked the energy or had quailed at the prospect of appearing on the same public platform with his opponent , Senator Goldwater . In the closing days of the campaign , a smear of un-known parentage appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalin , asking " Why not Barry Gold-water ? " The Goldwater camp angrily denounced the handbill as a scurrilous trick , and the McFarland camp , disclaiming any knowledge of it , insinuated that Gold-water had planted the cartoon . Said The Republic : " MAC IN TEARS ABOUT SMEARS : WHAT DOES HE SAY OF THIS ? " The lead on this " news story " : " Further evidence of the type of political campaign conducted by COPE appeared here yesterday in thousands of pamphlets attacking Sen. Barry Goldwater . " No one , not even the FBI which was called in on the case , officially knew or knows now who had had the leaflets printed . They could have conceivably come from either camp . Yet front-page top line on November 2 told of the coming to Arizona of an investigator from the Senate Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections . Under the head : SENATE COUNSEL FLIES TO PHOENIX , The Republic , speaking of the Joe Stalin cartoon , said , " Political observers in Arizona attributed the Goldwater smear to those supporting McFarland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political observers " were : " The guys that wrote the story . "
