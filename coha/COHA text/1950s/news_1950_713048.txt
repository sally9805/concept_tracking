Letters to The Times New York Census Discussed Metropolitan Area Is Considered to Be Real Unit To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of July 10 , " Lost : 400,000 New Yorkers , " takes such a restricted view that it might have been headed " City vs . Suburbs . " As the Regional Planning Association has often shown , our present organization of municipal life is far behind the times . The metropolitan area of New York City contains 16 million people ( 1950 census ) , 60 per ' cent more than all of California and twice as many as Australia . This metropolitan area is the real unit , as was well set forth in your Sunday Magazine article of June 18 , " The Suburbs Are Strangling the City . " There are 500 municipalities in this area and each has its Mayor and Council , very few of whom would wish without a struggle to relinquish authority to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. Renner in the American Magazine advocated that each metropolitan area of more than three million people should be constituted as a separate state . To balance this , he would amalgamate certain states , such as Delaware and Maryland , in one , and all of New England into another . What we are dealing with are " Political Myths and Economic Realities , " as Francis Delaisi has so well expressed it . Since , as you say , " New York is sharing the fate of other American cities in losing population to its surrounding suburbs , " it is high time for more realism . The industrial cities make America strong and the suburbs make her beautiful . No amount of artificial urban improvements can reverse that balance . PRO BONO PUBLICO . New York , July 10 , 1950 . New Class Created To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your news report that the New York City census figures seem surprisingly low is hardly a surprise to my wife and myself , not to mention several other of our Manhattan friends who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ census counter has ever approached us at our old abode , 132 West Forty-eighth Street , or at our new one , 414 East Fifty-second Street . If this is symptomatic of the way things are being done , the total count may well be off a million or two . We are not personally disturbed by this snub , but think of the sociological significance : it creates a whole new class of non-existent citizens . DOUGLAS WOOD GIBSON . New York , July 10 , 1950 . Uncounted in Census To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial of July 10 , " Lost : 400 , - 000 New Yorkers , " was of great interest to me . Although I live in a very accessible place , in the East Fifties , no census taker has approached me , and I am uncounted . CHARLES L. WEIGHT . New York , July 10 , 1950 . Press Restrictions in Argentina TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I trust that you will permit me to add a few facts to Virginia Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will strengthen the points she makes and will show that Peron has not infrequently used his interference with the freedom of the press to prevent opposition political parties from reaching the voters with their message . In previous dispatches on the question of the freedom of the press your correspondent has often used the case of the Socialist newspaper La Vanguardia , and for that reason doubtless felt that it need no longer be repeated . But old tales often deserve to be retold , and especially this one , for few here realize the length to which Peron has gone . When three years ago , Peron closed , on a technicality even . more trivial than he has used against other newspapers mentioned by Miss Warren , La Vanguardia , one of the oldest Argentine newspapers , with a continuous service of more than fifty years , it had a circulation of about 300,000 . Every effort to have it reopened has so far been in vain . Furthermore , attempts to substitute other papers for the closed La Vanguardia have been equally unsuccessful . For a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Government killed it by refusing to continue its second-class mailing privileges and by interfering with its distribution in other ways . La Lucha , which took its place , met with a similar fate when the Government threatened to put the printer out of business if he insisted on printing the paper . Since then the Socialist party has been unable to get any printer to undertake the job . In the meantime its own presses are rusting because the Government refuses to lift the suspension against La Vanguardia . FANNY SIMON , Member of the International Affairs Committee of the Socialist Party , U. S. A. , in charge of Latin-American relations . New York , July 10 , 1950 . Education in Race Equality To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : News of the Supreme Court decisions of June 5 outlawing segregation in interstate transportation and education was received by Americans in Germany with great satisfaction . Some Germans have tried to defend Nazi racial pen2-cution by pointing to American discrimination against Negroes . The court decisions will strengthen the hand of every American in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMES of June 21 , raised some questions , however , in that he challenged " relying on educative processes . " Some Americans here know that there were hundreds of German laws both federal and state against anti-Semitism in the Weimar republic . But Hitler wiped them out along with the courts without any difficulty . One wonders about the efficacy of laws and court decisions without the support of public opinion which the educative process and religion can provide . ' Mr. Robison is correct in writing that " it will require a vast mobilization of resources to compel acceptance of the present decisions . " The education , broadly defined , of the past twenty years and of the next twenty years will constitute a major part of that " vast mobilization of resources " essential to implementation of the Supreme Court decisions and to the ' social adjustments attendant to them . WILLARD JOHNSON . Bad Nauheim , Germany , June 25. 1950 . Aircraft Safety Measures Inadequacies Seen in Development of Our Air Transport Design To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea is directed mainly to victims of noncombatant air crashes . In reality , these persons should no more be considered war casualties than the fifty-eight who recently lost their lives over Lake Michigan in this country 's worst air disaster . The Congressional Record of June 22 carries remarks by Congressman Harold Donahue of Massachusetts which clearly point out the unexplainable reluctance of the United States aircraft and airline facilities to introduce important safety measures which have already been tried and proven . An analysis of Congressman Donahue 's remarks certainly indicates that we have permitted our air transport develop .. ment to stagnate around one design . The solution to some 65 per cent of our fatal air crashes is to displace the fuel from the engines and house the passengers in more than just a shelllike fuselage structure . It is reasonable to assume that the Lake Michigan crash airliner encountered severe turbulence and had its gas cells ruptured , permitting seeping fuel to come in contact with the hot engines or their exhausts . Numerous news photos clearly show how even minor crashes collapse the present day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety research groups have been citing these inadequacies in our air transports . So far , only one man seems to have done anything toward improving the situation . Vincent J. Burnelli 's lifting body type design eliminates almost completely the aforementioned hazards that cause noncombatant air deaths , both at home and abroad . Yet , though his Planes have been successfully flown and wind tunnel tested , the aviation industry in general has been reluctant to accept the obvious for no apparent reason . It all leaves me rather perplexed . You see , I have more than a casual interest in the airplane business  --  I am a pilot and have to fly them for a living . CHALMERS H. GOODLIN . New York , July 5 , 1950 . Our Future Attitude on Korea To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YOP.K TIMES : As one to whom civilization seems too precious and laborious an achievement to be lightheartedly destroyed , I respectfully suggest that our Government and the Security Council of the United Nations , to counter charges of American imperialism should solemnly pledge themselves , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Korea : To refrain from invading North Korea ; To accept a free plebiscite in South Korea as to whether it desires union with North Korea ; In the event of an affirmative vote. , to arrange for a free election , by all adult Koreans , of a democratic government for all Korea ; and To allow these elections to be supervised , and their integrity guaranteed , by an international commission appointed by the unanimous vote of the full Security Council of the ' Unites ' Nations . WILL DURAN T. Lake Hill , N. Y. , July 8 , 1950 . To Combat Postal Deficit To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : This might be captioned " How to Get the Post Office Department Out of the Red . " Why not put in a package-wrapping department in every first-class post office ? It could be tied in with the parcel post department . Most people de not know how to tie a parcel properly . Many people do not have the right equipment , cord , . paper , boxes , cartons , handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge , say 25 cents to 50 cents , depending on the size of the parcel and the number of items , for having their packages wrapped . This service would be especially welcome around the Christmas holidays , Father 's Day , Mother 's Day , etc . With 3,000 men wrapping about 100 parcels a day at an average price of 30 cents per parcel , this service department would gross better than $25 , - 000,000 annually . The Third Assistant Postmaster General should look into this . ALBERT R. DWYER . Mount Vernon , N. Y. , July 10 , 1950 . Heavier Steel to Protect Cars To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have just received my new 1950 car , which cost twice the 1940 model . Now I have a more powerful motor and am surrounded with thin sheet metal in the body and fenders , making it a potential death trap in case of accident . You report 430 deaths over the holiday . Many of these people would be alive had the automobile manufacturers used heavier steel , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . S. F. M. St. Albans , N. Y. , July 5 , 1950.
