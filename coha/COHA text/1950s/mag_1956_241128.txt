Globetrotting British Historian Arnold Toynbee turned up in Manila , and after looking it over and thinking it over , reported a change of mind to the London Observer . " In spite of my affection for America , " he wrote , " I have sometimes felt a touch of the same irritation as my fellow Dutchmen , Frenchmen , and Britons at hearing my American friends confidently assert that America has done better by the Philippines than the rest of us Westerners have done by those Asian and African countries that have been temporarily under our rule . My glimpse of the Philippines has changed my feelings about this . The American boast is a proud one , but I believe it is no more than the plain truth . "
