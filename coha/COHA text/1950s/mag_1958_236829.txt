Hoping to float a nuclear-powered tanker by 1961 , the Atomic Energy Commission and the Maritime Administration last week awarded design-study contracts totaling $400,000 to General Electric Co. and Manhattan 's George G. Sharp marine-engineering firm . The plan is to install a boiling-water reactor in a conventional T-5 tanker , now being built by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp . at Pascagoula , Miss . The Sharp company also is designing the first U.S. atomic passenger and cargo ship , the N.S. Savannah , for launching in 1960 . The Government hopes that lessons learned in building the Savannah will make the power plant of the atomic tanker lighter and cheaper than that of the merchantman . While the 22,500-ton tanker will not be economically competitive with a conventional ship , experts reckon that a nuclear tanker of 85,000 to 100.000 tons would be commercially feasible .
