Steelworkers ' Chief David J. McDonald reached across a table in Pittsburgh 's Hotel William Penn one day last week and handed a sheaf of papers to Clifford Hood , president of U.S. Steel . Thus the steelmakers opened negotiations for a new contract . There was nothing new or unexpected in the union 's 22 contract demands-a guaranteed annual wage , " substantial " wage increases , premium pay for weekend work-and the first session brought out no fireworks . Nevertheless the session made history . Sitting around the table were representatives not only from giant U.S. Steel but from Bethlehem and Republic as well-the Big Three which employ 60% of all steel labor and make 55% of all steel . It was the first time that the steel companies had voluntarily sat down to industry-wide bargaining . Previously they had always talked separately , with U.S. Steel generally setting the pattern which was then followed by the others . <P> Company spokesmen were careful to deny that a precedent for industry-wide bargaining had been set . Said U.S. Steel 's Chief Spokesman John Stephens : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . " But Dave McDonald was jubilant . Actually , for all their apprehensions about joint bargaining , the idea had some attractions for the steelmakers ; e.g. , in case of deadlock they could present a united employers ' front , make it more difficult for the union to negotiate separate agreements and pick them off one by one . By seeming to bow to McDonald 's strategy , the steelmen were also boosting the union chief 's stock with his men . The industry likes McDonald , a reasonable , conservative unionist , raised by the late Phil Murray from stenographer to become his successor as head of the 1,250,000-man union . <P> This week the talks went on in a setting deliberately chosen by both sides to speed an early settlement and beat the June 30 strike deadline . The negotiators are moving to Manhattan , away from Pittsburgh and intense local pressures . In place of massive negotiating committees , each side has slimmed itself to a four-man team , with Stephens heading the industry group ( U.S. Steel , Bethlehem , Republic , Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and McDonald heading the union bargainers.
