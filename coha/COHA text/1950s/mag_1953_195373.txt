In their soundproof hearing room , members of Congress ' Joint Committee on Atomic Energy broke a three-month deadlock ( TIME , March 23 ) . By unanimous vote last week , they elected New York 's Representative W. Sterling Cole as their chairman and Iowa 's Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper as vice chairman . <P> The deadlock had lasted through six meetings of the committee . Six times the members had divided right down the middle : eight Senators for Hickenlooper , eight Representatives for Cole . Then House Speaker Joe Martin and Senate Majority Leader Bob Taft stepped in . Martin convinced Taft that the Represenatives were right in their contention that the chairmanship should alternate between Senate and House . Taft persuaded the Senate members to retreat from their stand that a Senator should always head the committee . <P> " Stubby " Cole , the new Mr. Atom of Congress , was born at Painted Post , N.Y . ( pop . 2,405 ) 49 years ago this month . He made Phi Beta Kappa at Colgate ( class of ' 25 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law School of Union University in 1929 , began practicing in Bath , N.Y . He was elected to Congress in 1934 at 30 . <P> The short , grey and handsome Cole is married , has three sons , is an elder of the Bath Presbyterian Church . His most active interest beyond work and family : good food . He imports Cheddar cheese from his district ( New York 's new 37th-the Binghamton area ) and passes it around on the Hill . California 's Representative Leroy Johnson keeps him supplied with Bing cherries , which Cole soaks for a year in bourbon to produce his own excellent cherry liqueur . <P> Although a member of the Armed Services Committee since 1946 , Cole talks as much about disarmament as armament . In 1950 , he expressed doubts about the morality of the hydrogen bomb , pointing out that it is a weapon for mass destruction . He also doubted whether it was practical , asked : " Is it worth the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to produce it ? " The same year , he introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations . <P> Cole thinks the U.S. Government should tell its people more about atomic energy , and feels it could do so without violating security . On the other hand , he vigorously opposes giving any secret atomic information to the allies , even Great Britain , because " they are too lenient with traitors . " Confident that the U.S. is far ahead in atomic development , Cole nevertheless sees a great , new field to conquer . Said he : " We have advanced so far in stockpiling and capacity to produce A-bombs and weapons that we can afford to turn some of our attention to the development of atomic energy for industrial power .
