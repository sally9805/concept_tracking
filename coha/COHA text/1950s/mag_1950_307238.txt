Mario Scelba , Italian Minister of the Interior , gripped the white steering wheel and stepped on the gas . His jet-black car shot ahead along the die-straight highway at 80 m.p.h. , leaving his escort of police motorcycles and official limousines far behind . Scelba was racing into the " triangle of death , " a section of Emilia in northern Italy , the notorious Red stronghold where scores of men have been killed in violent flare-ups between Communists and antiCommunists . There were plenty of Reds who would have liked to kill Minister Scelba himself . <P> As Scelba reached Modena , he got out of his car to look carefully at a poster . Under the caption " Scelba is in Emilia . He must n't get out ! " a cartoon showed a mouse with Scelba 's face caught in a trap . Grimly Scelba climbed back into his car and drove on-still further into the trap . <P> 48 or 52 ? No mouse is Sicilian Mario Scelba . A lawyer and Popular Party worker before the war , he has emerged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalition cabinet . He has rebuilt Italy 's police into a wellarmed , well-disciplined force nearly a quarter-million strong ; his famed celere , or motorized police , whizz through Italian cities in jeeps , cracking down relentlessly on Communist street brawlers . To Communists , he is Public Enemy Numero Uno . <P> Yet Scelba drove on serenely . At Carpi , scene of repeated Red-led strikes , he got out and walked through the market place , alone and unprotected . When the crowd recognized his balding head and his hooked Sicilian nose , some people sneered , but most , admiring his guts , applauded . When Scelba 's police escort finally caught up with him and asked anxiously whether they had better clear the square , Scelba just laughed and walked on , still alone . <P> Later he drove on to Campagnola . While he was eating a hearty lunch accompanied by a quart of sparkling Lambrusco , a Communist leader burst into his room . " How old are you ? " snapped the Red . " Forty-eight , " answered the Minister of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " sighed the Communist , " You made me lose a bet . I just laid down a thousand lire that you were 52 at least . " Scelba 's bodyguard , who this time had managed to stay by his side and were fully expecting an assassination attempt , sighed with relief , and Scelba took a nap in a chair before an open window , a perfect target for any Red marksman . <P> Scelba did not display his courage just for the fun of it . He had a political point to make , and in several speeches during his visit to Emilia he explained the point . Said he : " Communists speculate on the fears of others . . . The Italian Communists are only a minority but with threats and violence they intimidate large sections of the population . . . We must kill this inferiority complex which persists where Communists are concerned . . . " <P> " In Times of Calamity . " To help kill the inferiority complex , Scelba had a plan . Scelba wanted to establish a civilian volunteer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect Italy against Red sabotage . It was Scelba 's answer to recent well-documented reports that the Communists are training guerrillas and saboteurs in the hills .
