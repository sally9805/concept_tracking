The Oswald Nelsons of Hollywood are probably the most self-sustained family in the U.S. They not only live and work together but , each Friday night , sit down to watch themselves on TV film and . an hour later , hear themselves on recorded radio . Both shows are called The Adventures of Ozzie &; Harriet ; both are broadcast by ABC ; both star Ozzie Nelson , his wife Harriet , and their two children , 17-year-old David and 13-year-old Ricky . Ozzie 's mother-in-law is in charge of answering the fan mail , and Ozzie 's brother Don is one of the show 's seven writers . Says Ozzie proudly : " We 're truly a family project . The program is entirely on our shoulders . " <P> Like the low man on a totem pole , Ozzie , 46 , carries most of the load . He produces and directs the TV show , edits and cuts the film , polishes the scenarios ( " I make the words sound real and natural " ) , keeps his sponsors ( Hotpoint and Listerine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures his sons on the Eagle Scout concept of honor or takes them on for practice sessions of football or basketball . On the show itself . Ozzie 's character lacks the overhead drive and adding-machine efficiency that he displays in real life . As in most other TV family dramas . Ozzie is pictured as a lovable but rather silly oaf who needs rescuing from untenable positions by his sweet , understanding wife and his tolerant children . <P> The Nelson children apparently accept their double life as completely natural . David says that the Saturday filming of the TV show makes little difference to him or his friends , since " most of the kids in my class have jobs over the weekend anyway . " Ricky has been more difficult . At eight he wanted to quit school because he could already read a radio script and was not able to see the need for further education . Ozzie insists that both boys will go on to college and to law school . He remembers that when he was a New Jersey law student he also had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evenings . He met his wife , Harriet Hilliard , when he hired her to sing with his band . <P> Ex-Athlete Ozzie ( he won his letter at Rutgers in football , swimming and lacrosse ) reserves a special phrase for high tribute : " The man is a great competitor . " He finds it immensely satisfying that his TV show has the highest rating of any on the ABC network , and that the Nelson family shares an annual income of $350,000 . When he was 24 , Ozzie drew a competitive satisfaction from the fact that he was already making more money than a Supreme Court Justice . Last week some rapid pencil work by Ozzie revealed that he had been outdistanced by his teen-age sons : David and Ricky now each earn more money than is paid the President of the U.S.
