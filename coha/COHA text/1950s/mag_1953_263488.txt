" There has to be a first time for everything , " said Columnist Drew Pearson ruefully one day last week , " and this is the first time I 've ever lost a libel suit . " That day a jury in federal district court had brought in a verdict in favor of onetime U.S. Assistant Attorney General Norman M. Littell , for $50,000 compensatory damages , plus $1 for punitive damages - the biggest libel verdict ever returned in Washington . <P> Lawyer Littell charged that Pearson had damaged him by writing in his column : " The Justice Department is casting a quizzical eye on ... Norman Littell . They have reports that Littell is acting as a propagandist for the Dutch government , though he failed to register as a foreign agent . " The jury decided that Pearson was wrong on his facts because Littell had never worked for the Dutch government . <P> Pearson planned to appeal the verdict anyway , thought his phrase " casting a quizzical eye on " gave room for a lot of leeway.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
