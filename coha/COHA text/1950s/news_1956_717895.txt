txt Faced with mounting opposition , House Democrats backtracked today orr their plans to push a revised farm bill with direct subsidies to farmers . Insteaa tney piannea to oiler tomorrow a compromise bill that would include the Administration soil bank plan and other features not specifically opposed by the Administration . The Democratic shift came as Senate Republicans and a few Democratic supporters prepared to start the soil bank through the Senate unless the House acts soon on a separate soil bank bill . It was understood that the effort to get the soil bank before the Senate would be made next week if the House insisted on taking up the new Democratic bill . The Administration 's soil bank bill is sponsored in the Senate by thirty-nine Republicans and four Democrats . Representative Harold D. Cooley , Democratic chairman of the House Agriculture Committee , said he would introduce tomorrow the revised farm bill that Democrats had hoped would he the vehicle for regaining 90 per cent of parity supports on corn , wheat , cotton , rice and peanuts . Fight Will Continue The fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between existing price support levels and 90 per cent of parity will not be dropped completely , however . Representative W. R. Poague , Democrat of Texas and author of the idea , will present tomorrow a bill including the feature . The Democratic decision to set aside the direct subsidies came after Republican leaders lashed the Democratic tactics and Representative Clifford R. Hope of Kansas , top Republican of the House Agriculture Committee , refused to go along with the Democratic plan . Mr. Hope said he believed , however , that the bill Mr. Cooley would introduce was " a fair compromise . " He predicted early action on the measure . Mr. Cooley said he did not " want to get into another party fight at this stage of the session and face another Presidential veto . " He added that if Mr. Poague 's direct payment plan was inserted in his bill he would support it . Representative Charles A. Halleck , Republican of Indiana and principal figure in the Administration 's farm fights in the House , said the revised farm bill was almost " certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " He and Representative Leslie C. Arends of Illinois , House Republican whip , called the direct // payment idea " a glorified version of the Brannan Plan . " The Brannan plan , named after Charles F. Brannan , former Secretary of Agriculture , advocated paying farmers the difference between what they received in open markets and a high , fixed support level . Contention Is Disputed Mr. Poague disputed their contention . He said his idea followed the parity payment plan of the Nineteen Thirties and that it would cover the dairy products and small livestock feed grains in addition to the five so-called basic crops of corn , wheat , cotton , rice and peanuts . Mr. Cooley 's compromise proposal will contain only one of several support price-raising features of the vetoed farm bill . It would give growers of small grains , rye , oats , barley and grain sorghums , a higher support than at present if they agreed to put a part of their land into the soil bank . The North Carolinian said he would retain the small grain provision because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , express itself on this particular provision and that he would not object if it were taken out . The Cooley bill 's small grain provision would nullify the Administration 's recent action of granting $1.25 a bushel price support to commercial or Midwest corn farmers and permitting them to plant as much corn as they wish . Heretofore , compliance with acreage allotments has been a condition for price support . Farmers who comply with controls receive $1.50 a bushel support . Other Provisions in Bill inner provisions in me uooiey bill to which the Administration did not object when carried in the vetoed bill include an increase of 8,000,000 acres in the 1956 corn acreage allotment and a stipulation that corn farmers must put 15 per cent of their land in the soil bank to get price supports . It also provides an additional $500,000 to strengthen prices of perishable farm products through a purchase program ; an additional $500,000,000 for surplus disposal programs ; and various means of seeking new outlets for farm commodities . Removed from the bill was the revival of rigid 90 per cent price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double standard for calculating parity that would yield higher support prices and two-price systems for wheat and rice that would have granted these crops full parity on a portion of the crops consumed domestically as human food . Both bills will be considered on Monday by the House Agricultural Committee .
