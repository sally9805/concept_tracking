The Miller 's Beautiful Wife ( Ponti-De Laurentiis ; DCA ) , based on The Three-Cornered Hat , the well-known Spanish comedy of confusion by Pedro Antonio de Alarcn , offers somewhat more confusion and rather less comedy than the novel . But the comedy is always pleasant , and the confusion , as Director Mario Camerini merrily confounds it in this Italian translation , has something of the suspense and desperate fascination of a tangle in milady 's drawstrings . <P> Milady in this instance is the miller 's beautiful wife ( Sophia Loren ) . The miller 's problem is that the governor of the province ( Vittorio De Sica ) is less than scrupulous about how he uses his authority . And so one night the miller ( Marcello Mastroianni ) finds himself sitting helplessly on a prison cot while , back at the mill , the governor is occupying the miller 's bed . But back at the gubernatorial palace , the governor 's wife ( Yvonne Sanson ) is all alone in the gubernatorial bed . The situation clearly demands robustious action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enterprising young man , and the miller is nothing if not eager to climb . <P> So it goes for more than an hour and a half-proof positive , in CinemaScope and rosy Technicolor , that in the movies no less than in geometry , the triangle is the most stable of figures , a straight line the shortest distance ' twixt two points . <P> The Seventh Sin ( M-G-M ) . Somerset Maugham 's exotically scented brand of soft soap has kept the mass readership in a happy lather for the last half-century . But yesterday 's suds , as that shrewd old party could have told the makers of this movie , just wo n't wash . The Painted Veil ( 1924 ) , dragged out of Hollywood 's bottom drawer , has faded so badly it is hard to recall that on Greta Garbo it looked good . <P> Maugham wrote his bestseller during the era of the not-quite-emancipated woman-a time when literary convention prescribed , as the natural consequence of adultery , a cholera epidemic . In The Seventh Sin the epidemic is caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British bacteriologist ( Bill Travers ) but carrying on with a French business man ( Jean Pierre Aumont ) in Hong Kong . When her husband finds out , he ( of course ) packs her off posthaste to the nearest outbreak of cholera . Her character immediately begins to improve . The local white trash ( George Sanders ) philosophically assures her that Schnapps ist gut fr die Cholera . But at the sight of a corpse the heroine clutches her throat theatrically and gasps : " It makes everything else seem horribly trivial . " <P> Unfortunately , she is not referring to the plot , which continues . Actress Parker goes to a convent , where she acquires Wisdom : " One can not find peace in the world or in a convent , but only in oneself . " Rather than swallow such bromides , the husband dies of cholera , and , as the widow sails away into the sunset , she remarks : " I 'm beginning to like myself . " It is hard to see why . <P> The Lonely Man ( Paramount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right at home on the range . The hero ( Jack Palance ) , like so many disciples of The Method , is 1,000% sincere ; he would not dream of speaking a line until he had lived it right down to the last rivet in his denims . The results are sometimes disconcerting .
