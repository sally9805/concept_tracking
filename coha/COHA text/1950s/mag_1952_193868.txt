Prussia 's greatest statesman , Prince Otto von Bismarck , often maintained that the squabbling states of Germany would never be united except by blood and iron , but lived to acknowledge that coal and iron played the larger role . Last week six Western European nations , including the ancient enemies France and Germany who have three times tried blood and iron , gave coal and iron a chance to unite them . <P> In the sharp spired city of Luxembourg ( pop . 65,000 ) , Sunday-suited burghers , many of them heavy workers from the Grand Duchy 's steel mills , stolidly watched the nine-man High Authority of the European Coal-Steel Community take charge of an industrial colossus which will outproduce Russia in steel and rival her in coal . The Schuman Plan had become fact , and with it the ceiling imposed by the Allies on Ruhr steel production was finally lifted . Behind a battery of red gladioli in Luxembourg 's City Hall , the men whose job it will be to sweep away Western Europe 's tariff walls , crush its cartels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel to all members of the Community on " equal terms " sat together for the first time . They were : <P> JEAN MONNET , 63 , " Mr. Europe " ( TIME , Aug. 11 ) , president of the High Authority ; <P> FRANZ ETZEL , 50 , German lawyer and chairman of the Bundestag 's Committee on Economic Affairs , vice president ; <P> ALBERT COPPE , 41 , Belgian Minister of Reconstruction , second vice president ; <P> PAUL FINET , 55 , boss of Belgium 's all-powerful General Federation of Labor ; <P> ENZO GIACCHERO , 40 , Italian Christian Democrat and professor of engineering ; <P> HEINZ POTTHOFF , 48 , labor-minded German steelmaker and German delegate to the Allied Ruhr Authority ; <P> LEON DAUM , 65 , French steel magnate and Marshall Plan adviser ; <P> DIRK SPIERENBURG , 43 , Dutch delegate to the Benelux Council ; <P> ALBERT WEHRER , 57 , Luxembourg minister to France . <P> Shrewd and practical men , selected for their devotion to the cause of Europe , Inc. , they were the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the Community were as nothing to the storms that lay ahead . Before the High Authority can come to grips with miners and steelmen , it must : <P> Patch up the blistering feud between France and Germany over the coal-rich Saar which the French control and the Germans covet ; <P> Establish a price-equalization fund whereby Belgium 's high-cost coal mines can be modernized and made competitive ; <P> Negotiate a commercial accord with Britain , the only major coal and steel producer which shunned the Schuman Plan . <P> Yet the directors of Europe , Inc. , who consider themselves responsible not to the governments but to the people of Europe , regard the Schuman Plan Treaty not only as a mandate to set up the Coal-Steel Community but also as a mandate to lay the foundations for a new supernation . Its name : the United States of Europe .
