In twelve years , Soprano Dorothy Kirsten has traveled from torch singing in " a joint in New Jersey " to the stage of the Metropolitan Opera . Not content with this success story , she signed up last fall to sing popular songs with Frank Sinatra on Light-Up Time ( weekdays , 7 p.m . E.D.T. , NBC ) . Last week , with Sinatra suffering from a sore throat , Dorothy Kirsten took over as M.C. of the show . " I 'm a long-hair with shorthair moments , " she explains . " People forget that I learned how to swing before I learned the classics . "
