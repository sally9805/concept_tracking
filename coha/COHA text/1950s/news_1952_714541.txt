txt Many Greeks are aroused by the intervention of U. S. Ambassador Peurifoy in their , country 's internal affairs . The ambas.ndor 's offense was to publicly take sides in a domestic political dispute over what kind of electoral setup Grecce should have  --  proportional representation or a simple majority system . Mr Peurifov backed the latter on the grounds that it would insure a more stable government . and hence more efficient use of American aid . This incident is not the first of its kind , nor will it he the last . In recent years , American officials have picvrtcly offered Greek governments much more pointed " ads ice " on such %at-led matters as the drafting of a new civil-service code and even their national budgets There have been frequent reports of similat behind-thescenes pressures exerted in the internal affairs of certain other countries . America 's attempts at intervention in the affairs of other nations are more obvious in the field of foreign policy . The threat to withhold aid has been used to bludgeon nur Western European allies into , embarking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or necessary . It has beenused to draw acceptance of German rearmament from nations which really do n't want the Germans rearmed ? the French , the British , even the German people themselves . But what domestic or foreignpolicy measures can achieve real success if they lack popular backing at home and if the people who must carry them out come to feel that they are imported from the U. S. A We do n't like other countries meddling in our affairs  --  and proud peoples the world over feel the came way . American attempts to influence their actions can only create a legacy of ill will toward this country . American intervention in the affairs of other nations is not , however , the fault of officials on the spot . like Ambassador Peurifov . It is implicit in the U. S. program for appropriating billions in foreign aid each year . The man who hands out the dollars can hardly be blamed for trying to get the recipients to spend his money in the most efficient way . The good will that America seeks to build abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense efforts . That is the danger of global largesse .
