Underlying Capitol Hill 's revolt against foreign aid is widespread misunderstanding about what the term means . Lumped together as " foreign aid " are several quite different kinds of assistance-and none of them is the kind of aid first given in 1948 under the Marshall Plan . Undertaken to help Western Europe recover from its World War II battering , the Marshall Plan had done its work by the early 1950s and was replaced by an aid program basically designed to support the U.S. 's system of military alliances . Of the $3.8 billion total for foreign aid this year , about $3.2 billion goes to provide military equipment and " defense support " for U.S. allies . But the notion persists that foreign aid is still largely , or even mainly , economic-a sort of international dole . <P> Last week Secretary of State John Foster Dulles cut through the confusion with a plan to put foreign aid on a more sensible basis . To the Senate 's Special Committee to Study the Foreign Aid Program , Dulles outlined a new Administration aid policy with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as for aid calculated to ease the defense-cost burden of military allies should henceforth be part of the Defense Department budget . ( But the economic portion of military aid will still be administered by the International Cooperation Administration . ) <P> Future economic-development aid should be offered as easy-term loans rather than as grants , and should be financed out of a revolving fund that Congress would replenish as needed ( estimated first-year need : about $500 million ) . Such a fund , argued Dulles , could " accomplish more with less expenditure " than the present rigid system of year-by-year , country-by-country appropriations . <P> Dulles ' outline left many a gap and blank to be filled in . One gap was soon pointed out by Export-Import Bank President Samuel C. Waugh . Would the fund 's easy terms undermine the businesslike hard loans that both the Export-Import Bank and World Bank are trying to make the basis for sound international development ? " Soft " loans , Waugh told the Senate committee , could " imperil the status of any loans made on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was any proposal for legislation to encourage private investment abroad . <P> But the plan was a welcome , if long overdue , beginning . Under Dulles ' redefinition , the arguments over foreign aid could now take on some semblance of reality , i.e. , defense aid could be explained as such , and economic-development aid examined and defended for its own value . <P> Asked Georgia 's Senator Richard B. Russell , one of Capitol Hill 's most outspoken critics of foreign aid : " Just what is the objective , the ultimate objective , of this economic program which you outline ? " <P> Dulles . To keep alive in these countries the hope and belief that they can lift up their economies without accepting the Communist alternative . <P> Russell . But where are you going to stop it , Mr. Secretary ? Is there any time that you can see that you can ever stop it , short of bringing the recipient countries up to our own level ?                  @ @ @
