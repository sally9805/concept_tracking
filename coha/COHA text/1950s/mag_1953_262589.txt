THE LITTLE MADELEINE ( 350 pp. ) - Mrs. Robert Henrey - Dutton ( $4 ) . <P> French-born Madeleine Henrey , a highly intelligent woman , must have realized the risk she was running in writing the story of her childhood . All she had to work with were the short and simple annals of the poor . Yet The Little Madeleine is a triumph over the facts of life , a moving story of considerable charm and readability that is all the more remarkable be cause it is not about anything or anybody of seeming importance . What raises this artfully simple book above the commonplace is Author Henrey 's deep respect for life itself , anybody 's life . <P> Madeleine was born in 1906 in the shad ow of Montmartre 's Sacre-Coeur . The cards were pretty well stacked against her . Father was an ex-coal miner from the provinces who had come to Paris full of self-assurance and wound up as an ill-paid laborer . Mother was a seamstress , a slim country redhead with a profound conviction that life would not hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was a succession of sleazy flats in the slummier parts of Paris , poor food , illness , and an environment in which bawds and criminal riffraff were taken for granted . Her father died a pauper , and for several days , while her mother tried to raise money for a funeral , the body lay in their tiny , one-room-and-kitchen flat . Madeleine 's mother wor ried about the effect on the child , but a worldly neighbor snapped : " Let her be ! . . . Hide nothing from your little Madeleine , and if later her luck changes , she 'll know something about both worlds . " <P> Once in a while Madeleine 's luck did change . There was a fine interlude when she stayed with country relatives . Another time she and her mother went to live in a provincial town , inadvertently moved into a brothel . Her luck changed for good when , with mamma , she left Paris for London , became a hairdresser at the Savoy Hotel while mother did dressmaking . Today little Madeleine is Mrs. Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gifted Child Actor Bobby Henrey ( The Fallen Idol ) . Her saga of life &; death in Paris is an endearing , peculiarly feminine mixture of gentleness and Gallic realism , a reminder that life has its quota of sentiment and that it can be conveyed without sentimentality .
