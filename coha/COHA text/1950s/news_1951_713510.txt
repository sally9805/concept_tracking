txt The State Department is gloomy about the Soviet note agreeing to a new meeting of the U.S .. British . French and Russian foreign ministers . The feeling is understandable . Whereas the Western powers asked for a meeting to discuss all disputes -- in the Far East as well as in Europe  --  between the Soviets and them . the Kremlin 's long-winded and fuzzy response seems to limit the talks to Germany , and primarily to the demilitarization of Germany as provided by the Potsdam agreement . Thus any hope of a settlement of the Sims-American war in Korea at such a meeting appears knocked in the head in advance . Likewise any settlement of the German proble-n in the sense of uniking the divided ? ountry . As to demilitarization. the one thing the Soviets really want to t ilk about . the Western powers can hardly be expected to relish conversations on that topic when it is now their agreed policy to reconstitute West German military units within an " integrat-d " European force . The correct interpretation of the Soviet note is doubtless that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block the rearming of Western Germany . Yet it would be a mistake for the U. S. to refuse ? as Secretary of State Acheson seems inclined  --  to hold this meeting The most obvious reason is that to do so would be to leave itself open to the charge that it is unwilling to negot. ite with Russia . This country should always be willing to talk , as long as it is possible to talk . Another reason is that it might be Possible to broaden the discussions . Suppose the only item on the official agenda were German demilitarization . It would still , it would seem , be possible for ** Acheson to closet himself with Mr. Vishinsky for a down-to-earth talkon the threat of world war . Perhaps nothing would come of this , but we do not recall that it has recently been tried . And es-en the question of German demilitarization might be worth talking about , even at the cost of listening to lengthy Soviet harangues about Amerlea 's ' aggressive designs . " For one thing . Americans ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this meeting as a means of getting the record in perspective  --  the record . that is. of Soviet violations of Potsdam and the remilitarization of Eastern Germany which the Soviets have long sinre undertaken . Finally , the possibility of some agreement on this subject should not be rejected in advance . Western policy on Western German rearmament should be flexible . It is a dubious policy at best : a reversal of the war aims of World War II . a propaganda godsend to the Russians . The Germans do n't want it . the French do n't want it and e.eryone is uncomfortable about it . Perhaps even more important , the Russians fear it . They fear it so much they have hinted they might pull a Korea in Germany to prevent its realization . But if they fear it so much , it ought to be a lever for hard bargaining , a means of extracting iron-clad concessions from the Soviets . Perhaps it is too much to expect that they could thus be persuaded to disband , for example , their East German military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone . We are only saving it might be worth trying . And if some such concessions could be wrung from the Russians , that would vastly relieve the explosive tensions in the middle of Europe . ' For that . we believe abandonment or postponement of the plans to rearm Western Germany would be a small price to pay .
