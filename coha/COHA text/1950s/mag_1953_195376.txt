Dwight Eisenhower and other top-echelon Republicans last week agreed on a successor to G.O.P. National Chairman Charles Wesley Roberts . Their choice : New York 's Nassau County Surrogate Leonard Wood Hall , 52 , a tall , bald , former U.S. Representative ( 1939-52 ) , and onetime chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee ( an experience that would be valuable for the national chairman in the 1954 congressional elections ) . <P> The first man to boom Long Islander Hall for the chairmanship was House Speaker Joe Martin , who toured the world with him in 1951 . Then Governor Tom Dewey stepped in behind his fellow New Yorker , although Dewey and Hall , old friends , had recently been on opposite sides of a factional fight in New York . Hall traveled with Eisenhower during most of the campaign last fall . After a call at the White House last week , Hall smilingly said he would take the job if it were offered to him . <P> This week the national committee is to meet in Washington to make it official . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
