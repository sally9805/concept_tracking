When his first son Yoshimitsu was born , Farmer Koji Matsuzaka of Shinshushinmachi , a small mountain town 160 miles northwest of Tokyo , boasted : " He will grow up to be a giant . " The proud father did not know how close his prophecy would come to the truth . By the time Yoshimitsu entered senior high at 16 , he towered 6 ft. 7 in . At this time he began to have blinding headaches and tired so easily that he spent most of his time lying at home on a tatami . School doctors diagnosed Yoshimitsu 's trouble as a hormone imbalance , recommended that he see a specialist , but Father Koji was afraid of the cost . <P> Not until last spring , when Yoshimitsu was 21 and had reached a basketball coach 's dream height of 7 ft. 2 in. , did he get to a specialist ( on a newsman 's intervention ) . Said Dr. Kentaro Shimizu ( 5 ft. 4 in. ) , one of Tokyo 's top brain surgeons : " These cases are so uncommon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Installed in a specially built bed ( 8 ft. 6 in. ) and swathed in a vast yukata ( summer kimono ) Yoshimitsu was X-rayed and tested to a fare-thee-well . <P> The findings : he had a tumor on his pituitary gland ; evidently it had boosted the gland 's output of growth hormone to a fantastic level , while suppressing its output of three other vital master hormones which govern the adrenal glands , the thyroid and the sex glands . <P> Dr. Shimizu gave Yoshimitsu generous injections ( up to 30 mg. a day ) of testosterone and other hormones for almost a year to slow his growth and help build his strength . Last March Dr. Shimizu performed a drastic operation . He opened Yoshimitsu 's skull across the forehead and probed past vital brain substance to get at the deep-hidden , almost inaccessible pituitary . Then he removed the tumor . <P> Last week the young giant was almost ready to go home . But what to do ? Dr. Shimizu would not let him join a stage troupe ( too insecure ) . Yoshimitsu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore the stares of passersby . Said he : " I hate to leave this wonderful hospital , but I am a grownup now , so I must face it . " At 7 ft. 7 in. he is indeed grown up , but mercifully , he will probably grow no more .
