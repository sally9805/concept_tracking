Mohammed Mossadegh , just about the last man standing between his country and the Reds , last week tried to take his country two steps away from Communism . The first was a little step . The unpredictable Premier called in British Charge d'Affaires George Middleton to discuss once more the possibility of a settlement with the British . Then , while Mossadegh waited for London 's response ( certain to be hedged with suspicious reservations ) , he decreed one of the most far-reaching rural reforms ever proclaimed by any government . It was more thoroughly spelled out than Egypt 's ( see above ) - if less certain to be carried out . <P> Under his new dictatorial powers , Mossadegh , himself a wealthy landlord , abolished centuries-old feudal dues and services , and ordered landlords to turn over one-fifth of their rents to the impoverished peasantry . Half of this sum will go to the sharecroppers on each tract . The other half is to be deposited to the credit of local , peasant-run cooperatives which are to be set up in each village to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water for the peasants . Point Four men on the scene applauded the scheme . <P> Aware that what he decreed in Teheran might ( and probably will ) be ignored in the countryside , Mossadegh announced that resisting landlords will be jailed for two months and fined double the value of their first evasion . Second offenders will be fined quadruple the amount ordered . <P> Iran 's wealthy landlords , who own 70% of the nation 's cultivated land and 40.000 of its 41.000 villages , growled angrily . So did the Reds , who screamed at seeing their thunder stolen .
