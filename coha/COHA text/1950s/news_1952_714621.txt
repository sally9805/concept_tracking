txt The sixty-nine prisoners barricaded since Tuesday morning in ad print shop of the Trenton State Prison surrendered yesterday afternoon . releasing their three remaining employe hostages unharmed . Another and larger band of mutineers , however , still manned a barricade last night in Rahway State Prison Farm , forty miles to the north , where a " sympathy " revolt was begun just before the 9 P. M. " lights out " on Thursday . At Rahway 232 " non-dangerous " inmates held possession of a second-floor dormitory with New Jersey State penal officials apparently determined to wait for them to be starved into submission , the strategy employed at Trenton . Nine guards seized as hostages in the Rahway disturbance thus far have not suffered molestation , according to prison officials . Word of the Trenton capitulation was conveyed at once by officials through public address systems to the Rahway mutineers as well as to inmates of the New Jersey State Prison farm at Leesburg . The news had no visible effect on the Rahway holdouts . Officials at Leesburg were tipped off that fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sympathy with the Trenton mutiny . Guards informed the inmates that these plans were known and there was no fire-setting . ? The Trenton surrender was realized bloodlessly and without capitulation to the mutineers ' principal demand  --  the ousting of Warden William H. Carty . The rebels won apparent official approval of a survey of the pron to be conducted by the Osborne Association , national penological welfare society . At 3:20 P. M. the Trenton rioters decided to yield . A few minutes // later they filed out of the print ( shop two by two . The water that they were believed to have cached in preparation for the mutiny had long since been exhausted ; what food they had stored and the sandwiches sent in for the captive hostages had been shared and eaten . Cleaning Up Is Put First Still they made " demands , " but these were reasonable  --  they wanted as prerequisites to surrender a shower bath , a shave and a change of clothing , even before they had food , and assurances that they would not be beaten ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The demands were granted . Bearded , dirty , weak from hunger and thirst , the prisoners emerged from self-imposed captivity . Since 11 A. M. Tuesday they had remained in the unheated two-story stone print shop building , about fifty yards from the entrance to the prison center . They had been wearing their working attire ? denim shirts , khaki trousers , shorts and shoes . Water and electricity had been shut off from the building almost from the moment of the revolt . The men were marched across the yard to Cell Block No. 1 in one of the dormitory wings extending from the prison center . This was prepared for their isolation in advance of their surrender . The three prison employe hostages were permitted , a few minutes earlier , to leave the shop by a side door . The hostages , two ' guards and a printing instructor , were weak and tired but unharmed , officials said . Oris Robison , in charge of printing instruction , was released Thursday night when he suffered a mild heart seizure . He was lowered from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had broken a heavy wire screen . The prisoners had set up barricades on both floors of the shop with printing supplies and heavy machinery . Talks leading to the surrender were carried on through a window , about head height , broken but covered by outside wire mesh , at the end of the building . The inmates , visible despite the darkened interior , were six to eight feet from the officials . Survey for " Ancient " Prison In a statement following the surrender , F. Lovell Bixby , deputy Commissioner of Institutions and Agencies , said : " It is my understanding that the Institutions Department will request the Osborne Association to make a survey at the prison and advise officials as to the needs and requirements of the ancient institution . " The prisoners had complained about the food , bedding , sanitation , recreational programs and parole procedure . Robert R. Hannum of the Osborne Association , whose good offices the mutineers had asked in the " mediation " talks , was present during " the negotiations . " Parts of the Trenton Prison were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old are still in use . It has been extended and modernized in most sections . Gov . Alfred E. Driscoll and other officials have voiced their objections to the prison 's being located in the city instead of in open country . It occupies an entire block in the older part of the city , mostly given over to industry . ? It is expected that the rioting prisoners will be kept for the present in tart isolation cells . Mr. Bixby said that " the punishment to be inflicted as a result of the disturbance will be determined later after a full investigation . " Leaders of the revolt were said by officials to be August B. Doak , 36-year-old kidnapper serving a life term , and William Dickens , 38 , serving a twelve to twenty-oneyear robbery sentence . They had armed themselves , officials said , with paper-cutting blades taken from a printing machine . Several others were reported in possession of razor blades . Doak and Dickens were reported to have cowed the other prisoners , threatening to kill them if they tried to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Prison in the town of Woodbridge 343 prisoners and eighteen guards were in Wing 3 , a two-story dormitory built twenty years ago , when the , disturbance began just before 9 P. M. Thursday . Before barricades ) of smashed beds , bedding , banisters , chairs and other furniture , plumbing and other appliances were put up , seventy-five prisoners and nine guards were evacuated at 10:30 P. M. At 8 A. M. yesterday thirty-six other prisoners who were in the ' day room on the first floor got out . They acted when the rebels removed the first-floor barricade to let out a prisoner who had served his time and who was to have been released yesterday . In the early scuffling two guards were injured and four prisoners , who apparently had no part in the rioting , suffered cuts and bruises . They were treated by Dr , Perry Proudfoot of Roselle , the prison doctor . Superintendent R. William Lagay said at 3 P. M. when he returned to his home after an all-night watch : " At present we plan to sit tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rioters on a weighted string in mid-afternoon asked whether they had a committee to negotiate with prison officials . There was no reply . The rioters kept themselves ap- , prised of outside happenings , including news of their own and the I Trenton uprisings , by crystal radio sets they had fashioned out of odd , parts . Charles Singer , assistant chief engineer of radio station WOR. ' said that the prisoners could pick up signals easily from the etas tion 's Carteret transmitter r mtl distant on almost any hometnadf device . The prison 's giant copper dome , a local landmark , serves an antenna for catch-all radios . Messages on Bedsheets The barricaded prisoners lettered bedsheets crudely and hung theta out of windows to voice their grievances . The messages , in black , red and green , read : " The Parole Board is not fair . We want a change . We want to see Osborne the Osborne Association representative . Tell the truth . We have a radio . We want a new Parole Board . We want an impartial investigation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segregation . Doctor will verify . " In Trenton Homer Zink , chairman of the New Jersey Parole Board , said that charges made by the rioting prisoners " are absolutely untrue . " " The men are heard by the Parole Board individually and alone . " he said . " Nobody is in the room except the three Parole Boa rd members and the State Prison 's Parole Supervisor , Manton Morris . " No man goes out of the room unless he has been interviewed by at least one member of the board , sometimes all three members . The clerk referred to in the prisoners ' complaints , presumably Morris , does not interview the prisoners . No prisoner ever leaves the room unless he is asked the following question : ' Is there anything more you would like to say " : ' " The names of the nine guards still held as hostages were given out by Superintendent Lagay as George Collelio of Jersey City , John K.
