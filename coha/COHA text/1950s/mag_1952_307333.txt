From the rear terraces of an expensive new apartment house in Rio , the residents can look down upon the bustling , bawdy life of nearby Kerosene Hill , one of Rio 's 120-odd favelas ( shanty towns ) . Kerosene Hill is a jungle of rickety shacks made of packing-case slats , flattened tin cans and odds &; ends of junk . Like most other favelas , it has no piped water supply ; favelados lug pump water up the hill by the bucketful . A hair-curling stench rises from the shallow ditches that serve the settlement as sewers . " We have a great time watching these human anthills , " said an apartment dweller recently , " but they watch us too . Sometimes we wonder what they 're thinking . " In his voice was an undertone of fear . <P> During the past ten years an estimated 1,000,000 people have swarmed into Rio looking for a better life than they had in the provinces . Many of them ended up in shantytowns . Today the favelados number an estimated 500,000 , about three-fourths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , avoid favelas even by daylight . " As a sanctuary for criminals , " said the newspaper O Globo , " the favelas are as inviolate as the ancient temples . The law . . . stops at the base of the hill , as if it were the frontier of a foreign country . " Cariocas fear favela-bred epidemics of disease and crime , but they fear explosions of discontent even more . Now &; then , a rumor that favelados are about to descend from the hill in plundering hordes puts fear into carioca hearts . Such rumors floated about during last month 's carnival celebrations , souring some of the city 's gaiety with a vague dread . <P> Biggest of the favelas is Little Crocodile Hill , where some 45,000 people live jumbled together in squalor and misery . Last week something unusual happened there : strangers invaded the hill and set to work clearing ground for a clinic , a police station and water pipes . The city government was starting a campaign to clean up the favelas , and the program 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen Little Crocodile as the first project . <P> Romano knows well enough that he can not merely tear the favelas down . " There is nowhere for the favelados to go , " he says . He is keeping his program limited in the hope that , unlike earlier and more grandiose schemes for abolishing the favelas , it can be carried out . His three-part plan : 1 ) stop the growth of favelas by preventing construction of new shacks ; 2 ) destroy the few flatland favelas , the foulest of all because the sewage in the open ditches does not run off ; 3 ) " civilize " the hillside favelas by providing them with police protection , free medical services , schools , electricity , sewers and running water . <P> Limited as his program is , Romano faces a hard struggle . He will have to fight an endless battle with municipal agencies for funds and cooperation , and he will have to combat the hostility and apathy of the favelados themselves . But he is determined to push ahead . " This may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we do n't control the favelas , they will keep on growing and turn this city into one vast slum . "
