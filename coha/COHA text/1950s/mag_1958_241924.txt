NAKED TO MINE ENEMIES ( 543 pp. ) - Charles W. Ferguson-Little , Brown ( $6 ) . <P> <P> Had I but served my God with half the zeal <P> I served my King , He would not in mine age <P> Have left me naked to mine enemies . <P> <P> This noble exit from history 's stage was written by Shakespeare for Thomas Cardinal Wolsey , one of the great Englishmen of his time . This biography , the first appropriate to the scope and splendor of Wolsey 's career , makes excellent reading on three counts : it evokes the vast historic tide that submerged the Middle Ages in the frothy waters of the Renaissance ; it tells a whodunit about who would rule England 's roost ; and it is a success story of a butcher 's son who rose to highest honors in his country and his church only to fall in the end . Though Biographer Ferguson ( a Reader 's Digest editor ) takes a cool view of theological matters , the book always conveys the rising sense of crisis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult role to represent both the universal church and an island king . As Ferguson puts it : " Rome could pay his wages , and England could enjoy his talents . " <P> The Tycoon . His talents were great . In a time when a Briton 's fate was largely fixed by his birth and when regulations governed life down to the smallest detail ( e.g. , the fine for " toying with a maid . " fourpence ; for breaking a glass , twelve-pence ) , young Wolsey 's best chance to advance in the world lay in the church . He went as a scholar to Oxford , excelled his fellows by becoming a bachelor of arts at 15 ( he was known as the Boy Bachelor ) . He was ordained a priest before he was 30 . A tireless writer and an administrator with ruthless business acumen , Wolsey went after church posts like a modern tycoon buying up companies . He became Royal Almoner to young King Henry VIII on his accession in 1509 , within three years was privy councilor and below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> With gusto , he accumulated bishoprics ( and illegitimate children ) . His taste for high life and ceremony was not merely personal ; pomp and circumstance were a matter of public relations , an art in which Wolsey was a master . A high point of his career came when he stage-managed the futile but beautiful pageant known to history as the Field of Cloth of Gold : in a pleasant French valley , England 's King Harry and France 's young King Francis I met to pledge a treaty of friendship . It was , says Author Ferguson , " the last great canvas of the Middle Ages ... it marked the end of the age of chivalry and somehow prophetically dramatized the end of the age of churchmen . " <P> The Split . Wolsey created an apparatus of state about his King-the framework of a modern national administration . Henry himself grew under the cardinal 's tutelage-one of the King 's first diplomatic coups was a pious book presented to the Vatican , which won him the title still borne by British monarchs : " Defender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wiser than his cardinal : " Prithee , Good Harry , let thee and I defend one another and leave the Faith alone to defend itself .
