txt FILM WRITERS LOSE CONTEMPT APPEAL Supreme Court Wo n't Review Lawson-Trumbo Convictions for Ignoring House Queries By LEWIS WOOD Some to Txz NEW YORE TIME . WASHINGTON , April 10 ? The power of Congressional committees to compel witnesses to confirm or deny whether they are members of the Communist party was upheld today when the Supreme Court refused to review the lower court convictions of John Howard Lawson and Dalton Trumbo , Hollywood movie writers . Through an order , the highest tribunal declined to examine the rulings against the two men , who were convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to answer the questions of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1947 . Eight other writers were cited for the same contempt , but their cases are yet to be disposed of by the courts . In other actions the Supreme Court : 1 . Unanimously reversed the conviction of Richard Morford for refusing to give the Committee on Un-American Activities records of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship , Inc . The court found that he had been denied the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias toward him . 2 . Refused , through an order , to review the contempt-of-Congress conviction of George Marshall , for failure to produce records of the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties for the Committee on Un-American Activities . Marshall was chairman of the organization . It was expected tonight that the // eight other Hollywood figures besides Lawson and Trumbo would have their cases heard by a judge who would make decisions after reviewing evidence in their suits and in the cases denied review today . The eight are Ring Lardner Jr. , Albert Maltz , Alvah Bessie , Samuel Ornitz , Herbert Biberman , Edward Dmytryk , Adrian Scott and Lester Cole . The ten men came into the limelight when the Committee on UnAmerican Activities made an investigation of allegations of communism in Hollywood . Lawson and Trumbo were each sentenced to ' serve a year in jail and pay a $1,000 fine . None of the other eight has been tried , as they agreed to await the outcome of the Lawson and Trumbo test cases . The eight entered into stipulations with the Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court refused a review as it did today . Government lawyers said tonight that the details had not been ironed out , but it was presumed that the eight would allow a trial judge to rule on the matter . Free Speech Held Limited In appealing their convictions , Lawson and Trumbo argued that the Constitution guaranteed them protection against revealing their private beliefs and associations . However , the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , upholding theft conviction , repeated its earlier stand that the House committee could inquire into Communist party membership . The Appeals Court asserted : " No one can doubt that in these chaotic times the destiny of all nations hangs in the balance in the current ideological struggle between Communist-thinking and democratic-thinking people of the world . Neither Congress nor any court is required to disregard the impact of world events , however impartially they view them . " Further , the appellate court said that neither the right of free speech , nor the " right to remain silent " were absolute . " When legislating to avert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national welfare , Congress may abridge either freedom , " the appeals court added . The ) actual presence of Government employes on the jury was not the compelling ' factor in the Morford issue as the court had decided in the contempt-of-Congress case of Eugene Dennis , Communist party leader , and elsewhere , that this was not illegal . However , in the Dennis case , the Supreme Court said that " preservation of the opportunity to prove actual bias is a guarantee of a defendant 's right to an impartial jury . " Today it concluded that a similar opportunity was ' . ! . denied " to Mr. Morford . Mr. Morford was executive Director of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship , which was included in the list of subversive organizations drawn up by former Attorney Co neral Tom C. Clark . Now an Associate Justice , Mr. Clark took no part in the Supreme Court proceedings today . Rejecting the demand of the Committee on Un-American Activities , Mr. Morford would not supply a list of contributions to the council . Convicted under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a misdemeanor , he was sentenced in the trial court to three months in jail and a $250 fine . The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the conviction . The unanimous opinion in the Morford case was a one-page per curiam , or unsigned , document of the Supreme Court . Justices Hugo L. Black . and Felix Frankfurter went even further than the other jurists , for they cited their dissents in the Dennis case to show their objection to Government employes sitting on the jury . Justice William 0 . Douglas , who did not participate in the Dennis decision , shared the Black-Frankfurter attitude in the Morford ruling . George Marshall , with whose conviction the Supreme Court declined to interfere , refused the request of the Committee on Un-American Activities for records of the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties in 1947 . His declination to give a list of contributors and other data , led to his conviction in the district court in . Washington where he was sentenced to three months imprisonment and a $500 fine . The Court of Appeals sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a question of the constitutionality of the Congressional resolution creating ' the investigating committee . The House committee had declared the federation to be " one of the viciously subversive organizations " of the Communist party .
