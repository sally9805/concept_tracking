" Retreat , hell ! " snapped Major General Oliver Prince Smith , commander of the 1st Marine Division , with which he had fought on Guadalcanal , New Britain , Peleliu , Okinawa ( TIME , Sept. 25 ) . " We 're not retreating , we 're just advancing in a different direction . " * <P> " We 're gon na get out of here , " said Lieut . Colonel Raymond L. Murray , commander of the 5th Marine Regiment . " Any officer who does n't think so will kindly go lame and be evacuated , but I do n't expect any bites for that offer . " There were no bites . <P> Said Colonel Lewis ( " Chesty " ) Puller , famed battle-scarred commander of the 1st Marine Regiment : " We 'll suffer heavy losses . The enemy greatly outnumbers us . <P> They 've blown the bridges and blocked the roads . . . but we 'll make it somehow . " <P> The running fight of the marines and two battalions of the Army 's 7th Infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles over the icy , twisting , mountainous road-was a battle unparalleled in U.S. military history . It had some aspects of Bataan , some of Anzio , some of Dunkirk , some of Valley Forge , some of the " Retreat of the 10,000 " ( 401-400 B.C. ) as described in Xenophon 's Anabasis . The retreat of the 20,000 in Korea would not have been possible without General Tunner 's ultramodern airlift , which supplied them with all the ammunition and food they could use , and even with bridging equipment ( see below ) . <P> Bulldozers for the dead . Assembled in Hagaru , south of the frozen , blood-stained beaches of the Changjin Reservoir , the 1st Marine Division and the 7th had already suffered heavy casualties in battles with the encircling Communists . They had heard the screams of their comrades when the Reds lobbed phosphorous grenades into truckloads of U.S. wounded . When the order came to start south , the enemy was already closing in on Hagaru 's makeshift airstrip , whence thousands of wounded and frostbite victims had been flown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately wounded man . <P> The marines abandoned none of their disabled men , but bulldozers pushed the dead into mass graves by hundreds . <P> The fight to Koto , six miles down the road , was the worst . The crawling vehicles ran into murderous mortar , machine-gun and small-arms fire from Communists in log and sandbag bunkers . The U.S. answering fire and air attacks killed thousands of the enemy and held the road open . When the lead vehicles reached Koto , the rearguard was still fighting near Hagaru to keep the enemy from chewing up the column from behind . <P> Beyond Koto there was a bad stretch of road winding through steep gorges . Moving at 3 m.p.h. , the column halted several times while engineers filled shell craters in the road . At one point there was a four-hour stop while the engineers built abutments on both sides of a chasm so that a bridge span would reach across . The airplanes silenced much of the enemy fire , except on one agonizing day when the air cover was grounded by a driving snowstorm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
