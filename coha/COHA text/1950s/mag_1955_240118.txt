In every city and town in Massachusetts last week , police searched for a blue-eyed , four-year-old girl whose name and face were familiar to newspaper readers across the U.S. Everyone knew that the youngster was safe , but no one could say that she had not been harmed . Hildy McCoy , born out of wedlock to a Roman Catholic mother , was the innocent victim of a bitter and poignant custody case . To avoid giving her up , her Jewish foster parents had hidden her in defiance of Massachusetts law . <P> Hildy was born in a Boston hospital in 1951 to Marjorie McCoy , a pretty , 21-year-old nursing student from Marblehead , Mass . Ten days after birth , she was taken by a childless Jewish couple , Mr. and Mrs. Melvin Ellis of Brookline , Mass. , who paid Marjorie 's doctor and hospital bills and gave her $150 for incidental expenses . According to the doctor who arranged the adoption , Marjorie McCoy was told that the Ellises were Jewish . <P> Is It Legal ? Three weeks later , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marjorie declared that she had just discovered that the Ellises were Jewish , shortly afterwards demanded the return of the child so that she could be brought up a Catholic . Since Massachusetts law provides that " when practicable , " an adopted child shall be given " only to persons of the same religious faith as ... its mother , " a state welfare agent called on the Ellises and warned them that the court would probably turn down their adoption petition . <P> The Ellises disregarded the warning , adjusted their lives to their new responsibilities ( " I ca n't tell you how nice it is , " Mrs. Ellis told a friend , " not to be able to go out except on Saturday nights like other parents " ) , gave the child solicitous attention in their comfortable suburban home . When the courts ruled against their adoption petition in 1953 and ordered Hildy returned to her mother , Hildy knew no other parents than the Ellises . <P> As the case dragged on for the next two years , Marjorie McCoy ( who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted Hildy back only so that she could turn her over to the Catholic Charitable Bureau for adoption by a Catholic family . The Ellises refused to give up Hildy unless her mother would rear her herself , offered to bring her up as a Catholic if they could keep her . When the court refused their plea and issued an order for their arrest , they fled with Hildy . <P> Is It Christian ? Last week , with his wife and Hildy still in hiding , Melvin Ellis , owner of a Boston dry-cleaning firm , returned to Brookline . " I 'm not a willing hero or martyr , " he told reporters , " but I 'll do anything to help the child . I am prepared to go to jail , if necessary , in protest against this law and its administration . " The court granted the Ellises a temporary reprieve from a contempt charge , ordered them to appear in court July 18 . Meanwhile police continued their search for Hildy.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
