It was perishing cold in France last week . Rich women shivered and complained about the difficulty of heating their high-ceilinged rooms , bus riders shivered and told each other that it was the worst winter in two generations , the poor just shivered . By week 's end more than 90 were dead of the cold alone-no one knew how many more of pneumonia . <P> Suddenly Paris was aware that a man was organizing a Resistance against the cold . Bearded and gaunt , wearing a black cape with the flair of an actor , a 41-year-old priest called Abb Pierre was rocketing through the city in a tiny green Renault , collecting old clothes , setting up distribution points , opening emergency shelters . From radios and the stages of theaters , on street corners and in churches , the soft voice of Abb Pierre appealed : " My friends , help us ! " <P> And the response was strong . The Ministry of Health doled out 4,000,000 francs . From another ministry came blankets . The army contributed trucks to move supplies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup kitchens and sleeping halls . The Metro turned over three unused subway stations to Abb Pierre for shelters against the cold . <P> The voice of Abb Pierre went on : " Empty your attics , Parisians . There may be venerable things in them , but they 're less venerable than the lives of babies . " As the Abb strode through a tent shelter late last week , a woman in a chic Persian lamb coat handed him $210 collected from friends . " Monsieur 1'Abb , " she cried . " You have awakened us ! " <P> The Soft Touch . That is what Abb Pierre has been trying to do for a long time . The fifth of eight children of a wealthy Lyons silk manufacturer , Henri Antoine Grous at 18 signed his inheritance over to charity and entered a Capuchin monastery . Eight years later tuberculosis forced him to give up the rigors of monastic life , and he was assigned as a secular priest to the diocese of Grenoble . <P> After the fall of France he joined the Resistance , helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forging documents , fought in surprise raids against German and Italian barracks . He was captured by the Italians but escaped to the mountains , where he joined the famed Vercors Maquis and founded an underground newspaper . The Germans chased him to Lyons , where he took the pseudonym Pierre and went to work forging identity cards until things again got too hot . When the war ended , he was a priest with six decorations and no parish-and no great urge to settle down in one . <P> He went into politics , and in 1946 became a deputy to the National Assembly . But his real vocation slid casually into his life with a young couple and a baby who had just been evicted and had nowhere to go . Abb Pierre bedded them down in his ramshackle house in a run-down Paris suburb . In no time , the word got around that the " abb with the beard " was a soft touch . His house became headquarters for the homeless .               @ @ @ @ @ @
