He who rides the tiger Finds it difficult to dismount <P> Ever since 1949 , U.S. businessmen trying to operate in-or get out of-Red China have learned the bitter truth of this ancient Chinese proverb . Under the guise of smiling cooperation , the Communists have systematically stripped businesses while holding their managers virtual prisoners . Last week the last of hundreds of U.S. businessmen , who once did a $1 billion business in China , was safely in Hong Kong with a tale of seven years of subtle commercial torture . His name : Charles S. Miner , 49 , manager of a big auto , newspaper , real-estate and insurance business in China for Manhattan 's C. V.Starr and Co . His company 's losses totaled nearly $5,000,000 before the Reds were satisfied . Said Miner : " Our companies were wrung dry like dishrags until we had lost everything . " <P> Promotion &; Profit . If any Western company could have hidden Red China 's tiger successfully , it was C. V. Starr and Co. , which directs a network of worldwide ( 69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starr , an old China hand and more recently a U.S. skiing fan . ( He has turned Stowe , Vt. into one of the top U.S. ski resorts . ) Starting in China in 1919 , Starr 's group built its American-Asiatic Underwriters into Asia 's biggest insurance operation , with more than half of China 's total business ; it accumulated large real-estate holdings , opened Studebaker and Buick-Vauxhall agencies , published Shanghai 's English-language Evening Post &; Mercury . When Charles S. Miner took over in 1948 , the company was doing a highly successful business and hoped it could continue under the . Communists . Starr 's Evening Post even fell for the line that the Reds were really " agrarian democrats " without binding ties to Moscow , went so far as to welcome Mao Tse-tung 's army as the beginning of a " true liberation . " It was a foolish hope . <P> Red censorship throttled the Evening Post so effectively that it was soon forced to shut down , sell its equipment at junk prices . The auto agencies next went under . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the land company , Metropolitan Land Co. , was allowed to manage its properties . <P> On the Treadmill . In 1950 , when Red China entered the Korean war , all pretending stopped . In quick succession , the Communists piled on enormous claims for back wages , charged fantastic tax assessments , added on phony claims for payment of insurance debts actually paid years before to the Nationalists . Starr 's land company lost all its undeveloped land to nationalization , was stripped of 200 rented houses in one grab on the pretext that the titles were invalid . As business foundered , each dismissed employee had to be paid off in U.S. dollars ; once Manager Miner was jailed for ten days when U.S. currency restrictions held up the necessary cash . To top it off , the Communists calculated interest on unpaid claims at 1% , compounded daily .
