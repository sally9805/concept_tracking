The world 's most fabled and , internationally , the least widely heard pianist is 44-year-old Russian Sviatoslav Richter . Most Westerners who have managed to attend one of his concerts are convinced that he is one of the greatest pianists now playing . But unlike such famed Russian contemporaries as Pianist Emil Gilels and Violinist David Oistrakh , Richter is not a Communist Party member and has never been allowed to travel to the West . Last week the West traveled to Richter . In Leningrad the touring Philadelphia Orchestra ( TIME , June 9 ) joined him in a performance of Prokofiev 's prickly , sardonic Fifth Piano Concerto . <P> The orchestra had never played the work , and Richter had only one hour 's rehearsal with the Philadelphia musicians before going on . But orchestra and soloist sailed through the piece with astonishing rapport , immediately sensed by the audience . " All the time , " said Conductor Eugene Ormandy , " electricity was flowing back and forth . " Richter gave Prokofiev 's tongue-in-cheek score a kaleidoscopic range , resisted the temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percussive effects in its driving climax . " He tossed it off , " said the Philadelphia 's awed Concertmaster Jacob Krachmalnick , " like walking through a garden . " <P> Unexpected Tensions . Pianist Richter 's technical mastery is so complete that he makes audiences forget about technique . With his enormous hands , he can play tenths and simultaneously thirds between thumb and forefinger . His bravura passages are majestic with no hint of pounding , his pianissimos a wonder of velvety control . His flexible rhythm gives even the most familiar music unexpected tensions . As he plays , his faunlike face registers emotion like a mass of exposed nerve ends , winces in a spasm of pain when he hits one of his rare wrong notes . <P> Richter is most at home with Liszt and Schubert , also plays Debussy and Ravel occasionally ( " They 're too beautiful to play very often " ) . Unlike most Soviet artists , he has a wide command of contemporary Western music , e.g. , Bartok , Hindemith . All told , he has a repertory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slew of concertos . <P> Only Clue . Starting as assistant conductor of the Odessa Opera at 16 , Child Prodigy Richter decided at 21 to make a career as a pianist . He enrolled at the Moscow Conservatory , made a name for himself in Soviet music when in 1939 he played the premiere performance of Serge Prokofiev 's Sixth Sonata . These days he gives as many as 120 concerts a season in Russia and the satellites . He lives with his wife , Lyric Soprano Nina Dorlyak , in a Moscow apartment whose telephone number he is too absent-minded to remember . When he is in the mood , he may sit for 14 hours a day at the piano , but he is also likely to go for months without practicing . He dislikes recording , and as a result the scattered Richter disks available in the U.S. do him scant justice ( with the notable exception of some fine Schumann playing he has done for the Decca and Monitor labels ) . Nevertheless , for most Westerners , recordings will probably remain the only clue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him to the U.S. , there is no sign yet that Russia is ready to send its finest pianist into the world .
