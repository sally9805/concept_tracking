The Civil Aeronautics Board finally gave the U.S. airline industry an E.T.A . last week for its general passenger fare investigation . Estimated Time of Arrival : February 1959 , nearly six years after the study was proposed . Grimly , alphabetically , twelve lines have uttered millions of words trying to prove that they need a 20% boost in air fares , especially now that they must raise $2 billion for new jet fleets . Before this simple message even reaches CAB 's examiner next summer , it will total some 20,000 pages , not counting exhibits . Then it will take another six paper-strangled months before a decision . <P> Airmen could tell the story in six minutes . With costs up 45% since 1945 , profit margins have slipped . U.S. airlines made only 4.6% profit on a $1.3 billion gross in 1956 . Last year the margin skidded to 1.6% , and T.W.A. , Northeast and Capital fell into the red with combined losses of $8,700,000 . This January and February the industry 's overall losses jumped to an estimated $12 million v. $400,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry is that by the time red-taped CAB gets around to deciding on a fare boost , so many lines may be in such serious financial shape that they will have trouble competing . Though the industry recently got an interim 6.6% fare increase , it will only boost the 1958 profit margin to 2.6% , far less than is needed to pay for jets . Domestic carriers still need $600 million , but simply can not make the healthy profit needed to attract bank financing . Wall Street is just as cool to equity financing : common stocks of the twelve lines are selling at 64% of book value . <P> The answer that airmen dislike but the one they may be forced to by CAB 's painful delay is a return to subsidy . Either that , or the industry may see a rash of mergers , leading off with Northeast , which won the rich New York-Florida run last year and still lost $1,000,000 in the first quarter of 1958 . National might merge with Northeast to eliminate a rival on the Florida route . Delta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems by taking over the struggling line .
