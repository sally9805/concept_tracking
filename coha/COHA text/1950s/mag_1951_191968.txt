On the sunny Charles River last week , Cambridge University 's crack rowing crew lined up for a race with the best in the East-Harvard , M.I.T. and Boston University . Harvard 's Coach Tom Bolles , who had led his 1950 crew to victory in the Grand Challenge Cup races at Henley-on-Thames last summer , was on the glum side . The U.S. crew season had only just opened . He figured his crew could be " about four lengths faster a month from now , " since in spring practice Harvard had only managed to log 180 miles . By contrast , Cambridge , in the racing pink , Had logged practice spins of about 850 miles , had defeated its traditional rival Oxford by 15 lengths , then whipped Yale a fortnight ago by four lengths ( TIME , April 23 ) . Said confident Cambridge Coach Harold Rickett : " We 'll never be any better than we are now . " <P> His simple strategy for the race called for " fast foot " from the start . Within the first minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 40 Ibs . ) Cambridge shell jetted to the lead at a 42-stroke-a-minute clip . Harvard fell gradually behind . According to Coach Bolles 's strategy , his crew was to conserve its strength at first , catch up with Cambridge in an all-out final sprint . But by the time Harvard made its bid , the smooth-stroking Cambridge " fast foot " had run away with the race . The blue-tipped oars of Cambridge flashed across the finish line almost two full lengths ahead of the pride of the U.S. Eastern crews . Boston and M.I.T. puffed in Harvard 's wake . <P> Harvard 's Bolles , whose crews have been beaten only twice before in the past three years ( by Yale in 1949 , by M.I.T. in 1950 ) , was not too depressed . " After all , " he grinned , " I only have to worry about beating one crew a year-Yale in June . "
