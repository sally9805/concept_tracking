Japan may be the strongest anti-Communist force in Asia . But as an occupied country , it is a limping liability which U.S. troops are obliged to defend . Recognizing that General MacArthur 's successful occupation has passed the point of diminishing returns , President Truman last week gave hope of an early Japanese peace treaty . He appointed U.N . Delegate John Foster Dulles head of a mission to " conduct such further discussions and negotiations as may be necessary to bring a Japanese settlement to an eventual successful conclusion . " <P> Behind Dulles ' mission is a new plan permitting Japan to make bilateral peace treaties with the U.S. and anyone else who wants to negotiate . This sidetracks Russia 's demand for a four-nation Japanese peace conference with vetoes for the U.S. , Russia , Britain and Red China . <P> Remember Pearl Harbor . For two years Japanese leaders &shy; with General MacArthur 's blessing &shy; have been doing verbal handsprings to attract the attention of the State Department treatymakers . More than a year ago , Douglas Mac-Arthur said : " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opportunity which alone can come with the restoration of a formal peace . " <P> Red China 's aggression in Korea stiffened the Japanese opposition to Communism . Japan 's Communist Party membership has dwindled to a new low . U.S. prestige , which suffered elsewhere , has apparently not been hurt in Japan by Korean defeats . The Japanese public is well acquainted with U.S. war potential . " Pearl Harbor victory " is what they call the current Communist successes . <P> Although confident of ultimate U.S. victory over Communism , most Japanese are disturbed about the time it would take the U.S. to mobilize . With Russia and Red China facing them on the mainland , Japanese have started thinking about rearmament . Hisato Ichimada , governor of the Bank of Japan , recently said : " Rearmament is a question forced upon Japan by the international situation . " Premier Shigeru Yoshida , who would like to use rearmament as a treaty bargaining point , last week cautiously added his agreement . <P> Cold Commitment . Rearmament would stretch Japan 's present piano-wire economy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw materials , even depends on outside sources for 20% of its food . Southeast Asia can supply part of Japan 's new material needs , but the loss of access to North China 's coal and iron has dimmed Japan 's industrial prospect . <P> Entirely aside from military expenses , the U.S. is now subsidizing Japan 's economy at the rate of $182 million a year . It could pay for some Japanese rearmament by continuing or increasing this after the signing of a treaty . The U.S. subsidy could be reduced by the re-creation of a large Japanese merchant marine . A bigger merchant-marine building program , long restricted by occupation policy , would put the Japanese in a position to import distant raw materials at prices they can pay .
