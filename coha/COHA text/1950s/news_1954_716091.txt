He was well liked , a good business man , and clever , but he could not seem to help Table Tilly no matter how he tried . Table Tilly was my dad 's secret name for her , because for years in the 1930s , Tilly had been trying to make her husband , Pete , buy her a new kitchen table . As each ' new style of table appeared in the furniture store , Tilly would drag Pete inside and dream over the table as Pete inspected it . He would thump its surface , jiggle it for stability , then shake his head . " It ai n't no better than our old one , " he would say .

Pete Agrees to Buy " I sure hated to part with my antique table , " she said . " But maybe Pete will be satisfied with a new one . " Pete thumped and jiggled the oak dinette set .
