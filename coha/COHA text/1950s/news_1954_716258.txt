At the same time , Ithe Administration asked for new authority , so it could bar subversives from privately owned facilities , such as electric utilities , that were important to defense . Two proposed bills were sent to the Senate and the House of Representatives by Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr . In a statement accompanying the measures , he said that they would " go far toward closing , gaps in present laws dealing with subversion and in tightening the legal net around the Communist conspiracy . " Mr. Brownell added it had been found that subversives in defense facilities " constitute a definite peril to national security . " He called the bills vital and urged their prompt passage . They had been approved , he noted , by " the White House Wand other departments concerned . " One of the bills would be entitled the " Communist-Infiltrated Organizations Act . " It would apply to any organization that was substantially directed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a member or members thereof , and is in a position to affect adversely . the national defense or security of the United States .

In sending up the bill to bar subversives from civilian-owned refense facilities , Mr. Brownell said that the National Security Council had studied the problem and found that these subversives " constitute a definite peril to national security . " This bill would be entitled the " Defense Facilities Protection Act . " Mr. Brownell said that it would provide the Government with " new authority to guard strategic defense facilities by barring from them that limited number of individuals who are subversive and may reasonably be believed to be disposed to commit acts of sabotage , espionage or other subversion . " A definite number of these individuals have been identified , Mr. Brownell said , and some were employed in plants where " sabotage in time of war or emergency would seriously impair the military effectiveness of the United States .
