Ever since last autumn 's " cardiac break , " Wall Street traders have watched the stock market climb and kept their fingers crossed , waiting for the inevitable " correction . " Last week , after a month of slowly slipping prices , the inevitable correction came . <P> The market suffered the sharpest break since President Eisenhower 's heart attack last September . The drop was led by the blue chips , which had paced the rise ; but almost every issue on the Big Board lost ground . By week 's end stocks on the Dow-Jones industrial average lost 23.90 points , to wind up at 472.49 , or 48.56 points below the alltime high set in April . The fall set the average back to where it was last November . <P> The break differed from previous shake-outs in one notable way : trading volume was light , never more than 2,600,000 shares daily , v. a 5,000,000-share day during the September selloff . Instead of a rush to sell , the drop was caused more by a reluctance to buy , notably by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips so high . But Wall Streeters guessed that the 10% drop in prices , which had put the market in the same position where it had found strong support in the last two big corrections ( see chart ) , had made some of the blue chips inviting again . Investors who had shifted out of blue chips as their rise narrowed the gap between the yield on the stocks v. the yield on bonds , now had good reason to go back into them again. * <P> What did the market slump mean to the U.S. economy ? One effect was to touch off a heated debate about U.S. economic prospects in 1956 's second half . At his press conference . Commerce Secretary Sinclair Weeks refused to be ruffled , said that " the market is just one factor to take into consideration . " <P> Across the broad face of the U.S. , businessmen were trying to see where the U.S. is headed . Farm-machine sales were down to the point where J. I. Case Co. shut one of its plants . In the troubled U.S. auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first annual meeting , in a big tent in Dearborn , Mich. , Henry Ford II put production this year at " less than 6,000,000 units . " Said Ford : " Production will remain a negative factor at least until the last quarter . " Furthermore , he added , " it seems unlikely that the general economy will expand markedly during the remainder of 1956 . " The frank talk won Automan Ford a cheering vote from the 2,400 shareholders , some of whom had grumbled over the drop in Ford stock from 64 to 53 . At the close of the meeting , many of them hurried forward to shake Ford 's hand . In Wilmington , Del. , General Motors President Harlow H. Curtice , who is worried about FRB 's tightening of credit ( see box ) , told stockholders that sales were seriously down , but noted that higher production by other G.M. divisions-notably Electro-Motive diesel and Allison aircraft en gines-would take up some of the slack . <P> Despite the drop in auto sales , there was no lessening of overall buying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peak . Retail sales are 3% above last year , and Philip M. Talbott , president of the National Retail Dry Goods Association ( 8,000 department and specialty stores ) , said that he expects this year 's sales to break last year 's record .
