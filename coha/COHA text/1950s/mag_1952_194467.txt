As a medical interne back in the ' 30s , handsome Pierre Chevallier was a young man of promise and of promises . The promise was fulfilled during the next 15 years as Pierre became a well-liked and successful physician , a hero of the resistance , the respected mayor of Orleans , a junior cabinet minister at 42 . The promises he made to his bride Yvonne were less handsomely honored . A year ago , Yvonne shot her brilliant husband dead , just a day after his appointment to Rene Pleven 's cabinet as Secretary of State for Technical Instruction , Youth &; Sport ( TIME , Aug. 20 , 1951 ) . <P> Too Much Coffee . Last week , after 15 months in jail awaiting trial , Yvonne sat huddled in grief as Judge Raymond Jadin recapitulated the facts of her life , of how she left a peasant home to become a midwife , of how she met the young interne Chevallier and , at 23 , became his mistress . Was it her first affair ? " Out , M. le President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23rd of May , 1935 . I remember it well . " <P> The judge went on to describe her subsequent marriage , her husband 's meteoric career and her own sense of inadequacy as he forged ahead . " You drank too much coffee ? You smoked too many cigarettes ? You made abusive scenes , scenes of jealousy ? " " Not true , monsieur , " sobbed Yvonne . <P> The judge pursed his lips and went on to the day , June 13 , 1951 , when Yvonne found in her husband 's wallet a love letter signed " Jeannette . " Soon afterwards , she bought herself a revolver . <P> At last the judge reached one fatal morning on which Chevallier came home to the wife who had waited all night for him . Yvonne threatened suicide . " Go ahead , " Pierre told her , " only wait until I 've cleared out . " According to Yvonne 's testimony , she then picked up her gun , intending to do away with herself-but in the heat of the moment she absentmindedly pumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst into tears . She took him down to the concierge . Then she went upstairs , planning once again to kill herself . As she thought of Matthieu and another , elder son , her arm went limp and-bang-there went another slug into Pierre . The courtroom sighed in sympathy . <P> Too Much Promise . The courtroom hissed , however , when slight , shifty Roger Perreau , husband of Pierre 's light-of-love , testified that he had refused to interfere with his wife 's affair with Pierre because " I did n't want any fuss or scandal . " It froze into stony silence when redhaired , creamy-skinned Jeanne Perreau herself announced : " I have a husband who is a good companion . I intend to stay with him . Pierre Chevallier loved me . I loved him . For love , one is never punished . " <P> The prosecuting attorney doubted the story of the accidental shots . He reproved Yvonne severely for keeping a loaded revolver , and for selfishly sacrificing a " public figure . . . rich with promise . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . But all he asked by way of admonition was two years in prison . The jury took 40 minutes to think it over . When they at last decided , the judge asked : " Is the accused guilty of having fired at and wounded Pierre Chevallier ? " The answer : a unanimous " No ! "
