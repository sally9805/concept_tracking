OCCUPATION : WRITER ( 320 pp. ) - Robert Graves-Creative Age ( $4 ) . <P> With the two words of his title , explains Robert Graves , " I fill in my income-tax return-but cynically because ' writer ' has become almost meaningless as a descriptive term since popular education opened the dikes to a shallow sea . " Having blared this raspberry into the face of the " antipoetic world of commerce and bureaucracy , " tetchy Poet Graves admits that he has been forced to spend much of the last quarter-century earning bread for his seven children by churning out historical novels for the antipoetic market . What bothers him now is how much longer he can keep the churn turning . " I shall gradually reduce my Graves 's orders , " he imagines a bookseller saying . " I would n't go so far as to say that he 's written out . But it stands to reason he ca n't keep it up indefinitely .

" Avoid reflections on the chastity of your opponent 's female relations or on any physical infirmity from which he may be suffering . Once you have gone so far it is impossible to retrace your steps and resort to minor forms of vituperation . Never shout ... Be calm . . . Begin with a great show of courtesy . . . " <P> One Man , One Vote . How little , muses Graves , does today 's crude swearer reflect the high polish of his Chinese predecessor . On the other hand , he has also lost the Elizabethan faculty for fairly plastering his " opponent " with a custard-pie onslaught of laborious , invidious obscenities .
