Former President Truman , on a filmed television program with Columnist Drew Pearson last week , gave his version of the famed " red herring " crack about congressional spy hunts in 1948 . Said Harry Truman : " The facts of the case are that , in a press conference one morning , some young man . . . asked me if the action of the House Un-American Activities Committee was not in the form of a red herring to cover up what the Republican Administration in the 80th Congress had not done , and I said it might be . <P> " I never made any statement that there was a red herring , although the Republicans when they 're in power always try to cover up their mistakes by attacking somebody or some institution . " <P> Quick were newsmen to look at the record . The record : at a press conference on Aug. 5 , 1948 ( the . day Alger Hiss swore to the Un-American Activities Committee that he had never been a Communist ) , Truman was asked : " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a good thing , or do you think they are a red herring to divert attention from the anti-inflation program ? " Mr. Truman 's reply : the hearings are a red herring . Then &; there he made an exception to the rule banning direct quotes from presidential press conferences . Said Mr. Truman : " Yes , you can quote me . I said they are simply a red herring . They are using this as a red herring to keep from doing what they ought to do . " The further record : Harry Truman subsequently criticized G.O.P. " red herring " tactics on Aug. 12 , Sept. 2 , Sept. 13 , Dec. 9 , Dec. 16. all in 1948 , on May 26 , 1949. and on Feb. 13 , 1950-nearly a month after Alger Hiss had been convicted .
