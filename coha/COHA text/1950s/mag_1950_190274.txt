To yachtsmen , a youngster old enough to sit still is old enough to learn to sail . On Long Island Sound , cruising ground of thousands of summer sailors , a boy or girl of ten is old enough to race his own boat in " midget " class ( under 15 years ) events . Last week the best of the midgets raced for the championship of the Sound , and the silver-crusted Scovill Cup which is emblematic of it . <P> All that a midget really needs in the Sound 's top event for young sailors is a boat of the 19-ft . Lightning class , good sense about sailing fundamentals and , for emergencies , the ability to swim . The 13 competitors at New Rochelle 's Huguenot Yacht Club last week had a bit more than that . They were the individual champs of 13 yacht clubs and several of them had raced for the Scovill Cup before . <P> Upwind First . Among the novices was 13-year-old Toni Monetti , a tiny ( 4 ft. 8 in. , 80 Ibs. ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Scovill Cup before . She borrowed a friend 's boat , the Bijope , and with her crew ( two 14-year-old boys ) , she managed to sail her way into the five-boat championships . <P> At the signal gun for the first of the finals , her boat began heeling over in the wind . Shouting orders to her crew , Toni set the tiller carefully , shrewdly tacked upwind around the other boats and forged ahead . Toni 's tactical philosophy : " The wind that comes off another boat 's sail is no good . The trick is to come around and put the other boat in your back wind . " By doing just that , and holding her lead , Toni brought her boat in first in two 2-mile races and a conclusive 5-miler . For Toni 's Manhassat Bay Yacht Club , it was the first Scovill Cup victory in 25 years of midget racing . <P> Champagne Later . Despite her skilled sailing , Toni was a bit surprised that she won . Her explanation to reporters , after a moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew . " But not until she was given a dunking in the Sound , a ritual for winners , did she feel like a champion . <P> Toni has been sailing ever since her father , Arnold E. Monetti , Manhassat Bay 's commodore , bought an Atlantic class ( 30-ft. ) sloop nine years ago . Nobody taught her to sail : " I just learned how by doing it . " A ninth-grader , Toni hopes to become an artist because " you ca n't make a living out of sailing . " But , like most of her fellow midgets , she fully intends to keep on racing , too . When she reaches 18 , Toni will sail in women 's class events ; the women 's champion of the Sound is feted each year with a trophy bowl filled with champagne . <P> Last week , in Toni 's honor , the midgets drank Coca-Cola from her Scovill Cup .
