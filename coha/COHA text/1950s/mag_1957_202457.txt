Polio is declining sharply in most of the U.S. for the second year , with abundant evidence that much of the improvement is due to the Salk vaccine . Four months of the " disease year " ( since the number of cases reached its annual low around April 1 ) have passed , and indications are that fewer than 1,900 cases will be reported for the period . This is just half the 3,800 in the same period last year , and less than one-third of the 1951-56 average tally . So far this year no area has reported a major epidemic comparable to Chicago 's last year , which was raging by mid-July . Only six states report minor increases . <P> Most remarkable to U.S. Public Health Service officials is the decline in paralytic as compared with nonparalytic cases . At this time last year , half of all cases were listed as paralytic , one-third as nonparalytic . This year fewer than one-third are paralytic , about half nonparalytic ( the rest are unspecified ) . The overall decline in polio might reflect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative drop in paralytic cases is almost certainly attributable to vaccination . <P> Even so , only 20 million Americans have so far received the recommended three doses of Salk vaccine , Surgeon General Leroy Burney reported ; 48 million others have had one or two shots . Though vaccine is again in brisk demand and short supply , Dr. Burney urged community health officials to plan now for mass inoculation , as soon as vaccine becomes available , of 41 million citizens under 40 who have had no shots at all .
