In St. Joseph 's Mercy Hospital at Pontiac , Mich. , a receptionist glanced up one night last week to see " a zombie " stagger hunched and stiff-legged through the main door . The man wore shoes , socks , and a checked cotton bathrobe ; his body was charred , his eyes swollen , his mouth puffy . " Can you get me to the emergency room ? " he groaned . As doctors gave him blood and plasma but no hope , the man insisted he was " John Doe from Washington , " would say no more . <P> Fingerprints quickly fingered " Doe " as Frank Henry Kierdorf , 56 , bull-voiced business agent of Flint 's Teamster Local 332 and one of Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa 's 40-odd crooked business agents ( i.e. , personal representatives ) . Eventually , Kierdorf gave his own explanation of his burns . He was home alone in Flint , he said , when two workmen appeared , invited him to a secret organizing meeting . At their plea for haste , he tossed bathrobe over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outside Pontiac , 40 miles away , his hosts stuck a gun at his neck , doused him with fluid and lit a match . Then they dumped him at the hospital . <P> Pillows &; Salve . Such brutality was plausible . Kierdorf had an arm-long arrest record , once served 27 months for armed robbery . On parole he had been made , at Jimmy Hoffa 's insistence , a Teamster official like his ex-convict uncle , Herman Kierdorf ( impersonating a federal officer , armed robbery ) , before him . As business agent of the 5,000-member Local 332 , Kierdorf used brutal methods and produced satisfactory results . Once he tried to run over a stubborn employer . Said another : " You do n't give him arguments . " By brutal methods ( see box ) and by picketing until employers anted up money , Kierdorf was successfully negotiating one way or another with every type of company , from sausage makers to rug layers . He might have enemies angry enough to roast him alive . <P> But another explanation soon turned up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim wore no bathrobe when he was hurt . Moreover , he had been dabbed with salve before he arrived at the hospital . A neighbor remembered a Cadillac at Kierdorf 's house the night he was burned ; another saw a similar car and Kierdorf 's green station wagon return two hours later , watched Kierdorf and a companion make four trips to the car with pillows and packages . Police found charred flesh in the station wagon and house . <P> " There 'll Be Another . " More flesh and a fire bomb 's fragments were spotted at a suburban Flint dry-cleaning shop mysteriously burned out the same evening ; a passerby said he saw flames in the shop , noticed two men running , heard screams inside . Police decided that Kierdorf was accidentally burned during an arson job , taken home for first aid , finally dumped at the hospital . All this they put to Patient Kierdorf , who had already been told that he had no chance for life . From Kierdorf came a huskily whispered obscenity - no more . A few hours later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
