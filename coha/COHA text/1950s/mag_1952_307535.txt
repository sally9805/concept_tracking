WAGES &; SALARIES <P> Since General Motors became the first major company to tie wages to the cost of living four years ago , its contract with the C.I.O. 's United Auto Workers has been virtually a one-way street . The net result to date has been a temporary cost-of-living wage boost of 26 an hour . Last week , to nobody 's great surprise , the auto workers moved to keep things that way , guard against big wage cuts if the cost of living should fall . The union asked G.M. to include 21 of the boost in the permanent basic wage rate . Other requests : hike the annual improvement factor from 4 to 5 an hour , raise pensions from the present level of $125 a month . Since G.M. is not required to reopen its contract until 1955 , the company was in no hurry to give an answer .
