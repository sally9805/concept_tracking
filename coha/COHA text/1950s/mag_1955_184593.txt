Endlessly westward from the 97th meridian stretch the Great Plains of the state of North Dakota , fertile in places , arid in others , baked by the summer sun and blown by the winter wind . Here wheat is grown , hard red and durum , and herds of beef cattle meander across far-ranging pastures , silhouetted against low horizons ; here more than 40,000 shining combines work 63,000 well-kept farms . The farmers are apt to feel sensitive when casual visitors from lusher and more verdant places refer to their hard-worked land as a desert . <P> Yet here it was , during the drought and depression years of the ' 30s , that dry winds seared hopes and dreams while piling the topsoil into dunes of dust . This was the Great Dust Bowl of the north , where thin-coated sheep could be bought for just $2 apiece and craggy-ribbed cows for only $12 . " We could n't raise a thing , not even weeds-not a thing , " recalled North Dakota 's U.S. Representative Otto Krueger , a dry-land farmer from Fessenden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people moving out , that one year I counted 675 quarter-sections of land acquired by the county because they had been abandoned with the taxes left unpaid . " <P> Although the big farms are now mechanized and comparatively prosperous , they are still so dependent upon a decent rainfall that farming in North Dakota is rated by its governor to be a boom-and-bust proposition : between 1919 and 1952 the state 's wheat production fluctuated between the extraordinary extremes of 19 and 160 million bushels a year . Since 1930 , the population of the state has declined from 680,000 to 620,000-the biggest percentage drop in all the 48 states . <P> Pyramid on the Prairie . Sturdy and industrious , mostly of Scandinavian and German stock , North Dakotans are working during this time of no immediate crisis on a promising plan to prevent future dust bowls . Last week beneath the prairie sun , tractors and dump trucks , concrete mixers and elevation loaders , electric and power shovels and bulldozers bumped and clunked on the project that is the heart of North Dakota 's new hope-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unpredictable Missouri River at Garrison , N.D. Garrison Dam , a project of the Bureau of Reclamation , the Army Engineers and the state of North Dakota , already stands 200 feet high and 2 miles long ; its 70 million cubic yards of earth and stone exceed by 20 times the bulk of Egypt 's Great Pyramid . It is scheduled for completion next year . <P> Next , the men on the job intend to draw out 525 miles of deep canals from the Missouri into the flatlands , to irrigate no fewer than 960,000 marginal acres and improve no fewer than 18 million acres . North Dakota hopes the new water will bring it : 1 ) 3,600 new farms , 2 ) 1,700 new businesses , 3 ) 20,000 new jobs , 4 ) 93,000 more people . 5 ) $250 million a year in new farm and business incomes . The Garrison project will triple the power capacity of the state with its 400,000 kw , and its flood controls will impound floodwater from 180,000 square miles . Eventually , the Missouri will be backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 15 miles wide .
