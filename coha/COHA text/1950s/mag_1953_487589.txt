A FEW days ago , after months of investigation by the F. B. I , efriend of , mine was notified that she had been cleared as a. loyalty risk and was " suitable " for federal employment . This long-awaited clearanCe is of little interest to her at the moment : she is in a hospital undergoing shock treatment for a mental collapse brought on by the strain of the investigation . Perhaps she should have been made of sterner stuff , particularly since her clearance shows that every aspect of her life ; past and present , can bear minute ' inspection . But as one who has been through the ordeal by investigation I understand only too well the state of mind that led to her collapse . Those of us who have grown up in the demo- , cratic tradition do not make an easy or rapid psychological adjustment to a police-state atmosphere . The number of federal employees who have run the gauntlet of investigation as risks to our country 's security has already reached many thousand . Most of us , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with loyalty clearances . But the experience will haunt us as long as we live , for we have in effect been on trial for treason And in the defense which we have had to make we have been denied the simplest safeguards that every civilized nation extends to the prisoner in the dock charged with this gravest of all crimes . We have been given no clear or eyidential statement of the charges against us . We have not been allowed to face our accusers or even to know who they are . We have been , by a reversal of all democratic procedures of justice , regarded as guilty unless we could prove our innocence . I recognize that our government must take reasonable and proper security precautions in these dangerous times . But when this legitimate and essential inquiry broadens into investigations touching upon the private lives and mental processes of several hundred thousand suspects , as it has in the United States today , common sense is abandoned and a nightmare of inquisition is set afoot . In my pre-investigation days I could not have imagined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like many others , I thought that suppression of our fundamental rights could not happen here . In Nazi Germany , yes , and in Communist Russia , but not in the United States of America . MY PERSONAL experience with the investigative process began during the war years , when -I entered the government as a war-service employee . I had never been a Communist or Communist sympathizer . But during the late 1930 's I had joined the League for Peace and Democracy , which several years later and long after it had gone out of existence was placed on the Attorney General 's list of Communist organizations . The league is the only organization of any kind to which I have ever belonged , except the Methodist church . But my conscience was so deeply aroused by the - Nazi atrocities of the 1930 's that I felt morally compelled to take a stand against them with fellow -- Americans who shared my horror at this evil . I joined the league as an antifascist . I took a government job in September , 1942 . , A few months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my membership in the league , which I freely acknowledged . I was also questioned about my alleged membership in the Washington- Committee for Democratic Action , D banization to which I had belonged and of which I knew nothing . The F. B I. man who interviewed me could not have treated a notorious criminal with colder contempt . In reply to my denial of membership in the Committee for Democratic Action , he asked how I could account for the fact that my name was on its mailing list if I had not been a member I suggested that the committee might have used the membership list of the League for Peace and Democracy as its mailing list . I had laid myself open to the implication of " guilt , " he informed me , by belonging to such an organization as the league . " Caesar 's wife should be above reproach , " he added , " and you ca n't fall in the mire without coming up muddy . " I reminded him that I was not guilty of anything ; I had exercised my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the league had stood years ago for the very principles that our whole nation was now fighting for . At the close of the interview he ' dictated to his secretary the gist of our conversation  --  my acknowledgment of membership in the league and my denial of membership in the Washington committee  --  and I signed the transcript : A few weeks later I received official notice that I had been rated eligible for federal employment " subject to satisfactory fingerprint clearance . " My fingerprints apparently offered no difficulties , for I served the government without question until after the end of the war , when I resigned to accept a better position with a non-governmental organization . YOU WOULD THINK that suspicion of my loyalty as determining my fitness ' for government employment might properly end here . But that is not the way these investigations operate . In January , 1951 , at the urgent request of government officials , I reentered federal employment to organize for one of the emergency agencies the same type of service that I had headed during the war years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interrogatory ; vaguely described in the covering form letter as " based on information received , " which I was instructed to return , answered and notarized , within ten days . The two opening questions in this interrogatory were the same as those which had been addressed to me nearly ten years earlier  --  questions concerning my " reported " membership in the League for Peace and Democracy and in the Washington Committee for Democratic Action . In reply to these I again acknowledged membership in the league and again denied that I - had ever been a member of the committee The next two questions introduced new charges The first , with rather confusing tense references and a sweeping inference , read as follows : The coMinission has received information to the effect that you were sympathetic toward the CommUnist Party and that you vigorously defended Communists , including Alger Hiss , portraying him as an innocent victim . If the above allegations are true , in whole or in part , please furnish full and complete information below . Include in your answer whether or ' not you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In reply to this , I wrote : , I sympathized with Alger Hiss because I was not convinced that he was guilty and because I was extremely reluctant to accept the testimony of a man like Whittaker Chambers . This does not mean that I have any c.sympathy whatever with perjury or treason Many Americans , including some of the jury at the first trial , shared my views on Hiss . I have never defended Communists or communism , either " vigorously " or otherwise , for I am contemptuous of the slave mind , whether Communist or fascist . My own political views , in so far as they are formulated , consist of a firm faith in the gradual and peaceful realization of the democratic ideal For this very reason , however , along with Justice Black and Justice Douglas , I am disturbed by the present tendency to deny , even to Communists , the traditional rights of all Americans to freedom of thought and - freedom of speech . I have not now , and have never had , a " sympathetic association with the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence , aggression , or tyranny over the mind of man . THE FINAL CHARGE against me was that on my latest application for federal employment ( Form 57 ) I had answered in the negative to Question 27 : " Are you now , or have you ever been , a member of the CommUnist Party , U. S. A. , or any Communist organization This charge concluded : - In view of your reported membership in the American League for Peace and Democracy and the Washington Committee for Democratic Action , Communist organizations , please explain ful- ly you- r reasons for failing to answer Question 27 in the affirmative . A copy of the Attorney General 's list , designating these two organizations as Communist , was attached . My reply to this charge was as follows : To the best-of my recollection , the application form which I filled out made no reference to the Attorney General 's list . I can honestly say that it did not occur to me to give information on my membership in the League for Peace and Democracy - in reply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to attempt any deception on this point , for I was fully aware that my membership in the league was a matter of government record . As a war-service employee I was called in for investigation on the basis of this membership , and I was later notified that I had been cleared for government employment . I have pointed out in reply to Question 2 that I was never a member of the Washington Committee for Democratic Action . - The interrogatory ended with an invitation for me to " note hereon any comments you desire to make regarding your loyalty to the United States which you believe should be considered in determining your suitability for federal employment . " Revolted by their expectation that I would shape up a little essay of self-adulation , I replied I have puzzled over this section of your interrogatory for a long time , because I wish to cooperate fully with the Loyalty Board and furnish all information at my command relevant to my suitability for federal employment . But even at the risk of my livelihood I find it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American citizen . I know that I am a good American and that there is nothing in my life to the contrary ; but I do-not know how , with any propriety , to count the ways and make a little list of my particular virtues that- would establish this fact . An interrogatory of this sort has one inescapable and , I think , potentially morbid psychological effect upon its subject , quite apart from his rational anxiety over its threat-to his livelihood and reputation . Each charge against him is couched in mysterious terms ? " It is reported that . . . " ; " The commission has received information to the effect that - . . " For hours after I received my interrogatory I found myself wondering who was my unknown enemy . I tried des perately to recall every occasion on which I had discussed the Hiss case and with whom . Finally I resolved to learn , as men and women in totalitarian countries have learned , to speak my thoughts on public matters with great discretion in the future . AFTER SENDING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I waited anxiously until the following January for further word on my case . It came in the form of a letter . to the DirectOr , of Personnel in my department  --  a carbon copy of which was sent to me  --  ordering that I be dismissed from my government post I had been rated eligible on loyalty , the letter said , but ineligible on suitability for federal employment The reason given for this judgment was that I had made " an apparently deliberate false statement " on my application form in answering " No " to Question 27 regarding - present - or past membership in the Communist Party , U. S A : , or any Communist organization . The evidential findings pn which this decision was based were summarized as follows : Investigation revealed that , as of the winter of 1940-41 , her name appeared on the list of the members of the Washington Committee for Democratic Action . The commission 's files show that she was questioned about this membership in connection with a previous period of federal employment at which time she denied that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Action but admitted that she had been a member of the American League for Peace and Democracy . The Washington Committee for Democratic Action succeeded the American League for Peace and Democracy upon the dissolution of the latter , and both organizations have been cited by the Attorney General as coming within the purview of E. 0 . 9835. - The Loyalty Board was willing to grant my case further consideration , the letter concluded , if either my department or I presented " additional facts " in writing within thirty days ; and pending decision of such an appeal my department could , at its discretion , retain my services . I had no additional facts to present . I had already given all information that had been asked of me , and everyone that I had ever known socially or professionally had also been questioned - minutely about me , as I learned from many sources . Even the girls at the telephone desk in the apartment house where I live had been asked about my personal habits and private ' life . Sick in spirit and - body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous exhaustion " now amounted to almost $200 ? I was ready to give up at this stage and leave government service with an indelible stigma on my name . Many persons who are equally innocent of the charges brought against them by the security officials do undoubtedly drop the fight out of sheer exhaustion and cynical despair ; they swell the statistics , of course , on the number of dangerous government employees from whom America has been saved . My salvation lay in the fact ? I might almost say , in the accident  --  that the director of my office was a man of moral courage . Such courage is rare in Washington nowadays , for even high government officials are cowed by the spirit of inquisition . My director urged me not to quit the fight , and upon his persuasion I replied to the Loyalty Board 's ultimatum . He also wrote to the ' board , attesting to the integrity of my character and to the faithfulness and competence with which I had performed my duties . In my reply I stated at the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further consideration of my case , for all the facts about me were already at the board 's disposal . The body of my defense was little more than a reiteration of points which I had already made in reply to the board 's interrogatory . SIX WEEKS after the order for my dismissal was issued , I received my last communication , to date , bearing upon the question of my suitability for government employment . In it I was informed that the original decision on me had been reversed and that the request for my dismissal was being withdrawn in view of the additional evidence submitted by me and the representations made in my behalf . The decision to spare me must have been based on exactly the same facts as the decision to destroy me . I could not escape , the conclusion , therefore , that my fate , whether for good or evil , was being determined by an arbitrary and capricious power . Moreover , althOugh my last-minute rescue did lift from my mind a heavy weight of anxiety over my immediate ' future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now settled and - that I would be allowed to live out the rest of my simple , quiet , harmless little life in peace . My apprehension on this point was well justified , as the newly formulated security program indicates . This program , which went into effect on May 27 , 1953 , provides for the reopening and review of all old cases in which , as in mine , " field investigations " have been made by the F. B. I. If I remain in the federal service , therefore , I must stand ready to play the role of mouse for a third time in this " cat-and-mouse game with the security officials . The avowed intention to reopen " some fifteen thousand cases like mine shows that the new inquisitors will not be outdone by their predecessors in violating the traditions of freedom In spite of differences in emphasis and procedure , the basic pattern remains the same : free opinion under fire , lawful , association a ground for suspicion , , discharge from federal service on the undisclosed testimony of unnamed informers The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensively than under the earlier program , and the safeguards that previously existed in provisions for review and appeal-of the charges have been removed Attorney General Brownell has said that government employment is a privilege , not a right That may be so But surely even ' a government einployee has a right to something better than dismissal and disgrace as a security risk to his country because he is said to have remarked to somebody somewhere that he does not subscribe to the political philosophy of the junior Senator from Wisconsin . As an American I have faith in the people . In this anxious period of real and imagined danger , they have been temporarily misled by demagogy into a mass hysteria that victimizes the social-minded and unorthodox members of the community . But I am confident that the senseless repression will pass , - like the Salem witchcraft madness , in a wave of revulsion against its excesses , and that America will again dare to be the land of the free , the last best hope of men .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
