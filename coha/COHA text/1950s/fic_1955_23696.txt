A Story by JACK COPE Drawings by Marian Taylor I TE CAME out of the shadow of the bush path and blinked in the sun . The clearing was scattered with refuse and tufts of dry marsh-grass struggling to keep a foothold against the bush . The sun beat on his head but he was listening and took no notice of the heat and of the flies that buzzed up at any slight movement . his face hardened and he ran his tongue quickly over his full , strong lips . He could hear them singing , children singing a hymn tune on a Sunday morning . Which direction did the voices come from ? The willow-bush stretched on for miles , crisscrossed by a thousand paths . One minute you were hidden in the dense , acrid-smelling foliage , your footsteps muffled in soft white sand ; the next , you were in the midst of a shanty cluster . Thousands of shanties and pondokkies grew overnight with the swiftness of a malignant fungus in the bush . They were the homes of the people flocking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . Once the land had been gleaming white dunes until the willow-bush crept overit and bound down the moving sands and shut out the sea haze and the great blue outline of Table Mountain anchored in sky-space above the City . Now the shanty-clusters brought a half-wild life into the bush . The axe was heard ; women laughed and hens clucked ; men shouted to one another over the treetops . He remembered how the police sometimes came ; they tramped along the maze of sandpaths at night carrying flashlights , keeping together in parties of a hundred or more with reinforcements waiting beside the nearest roads . Next day the shanty-dwellers would set their life in order again , talking with a low hum of voices , cursing . A song of lamenting would start , and some would sing with tear-brimmed eyes . On that Sunday morning Benjamin Segode listened to a different kind of song , a Christmas hymn of rejoicing . He had been brought up a Christian at a Mission in Basutoland . His father was a church warden and people said there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him . Benjamin had saddened his father , asking why he , the best preacher in Mafeteng , swept the church floor while the white missionary was up in the pulpit and could hardly make himself understood . His father had said , " God 's will is not always plain for a boy to see . " Benjamin had left Basuto/and and never returned . Though he remembered his father 's sorrowing voice and resigned expression of lace and hands , he had not stopped asking questions . His Sesotho Bible lay , carefully wrapped , in the bottom of his tin box and he felt its presence there like his father 's voice , reproachful , full of distant music . HE WIPED his face with a red handkerchief before he pushed aside the foliage and went on . He walked slowly , picked a leaf involuntarily , and bit it , tasting the sharp , astringent juice . The veins pulsed in his neck and anger was rising to his wide , upward-slanting eyes . He had a mouth turned up at the corners too so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semblance of a smile . The singing came to him more distinctly as he pushed on with muffled steps along the path . Children 's voices , not in his language but in Afrikaans , the language of the white man . That was what he disliked and suspected . Then he was out in a big clearing . Six or seven dwellings sprawled among a few tall trees . Close by was the pondokkie of a wood-hawker opening on a sandy yard where he kept his two donkeys , stacks of cut wood , chopping blocks , and everywhere untidy heaps of wood chips , bark , and refuse . The donkeys stood in the sun on three legs leaning their necks over the fence . The wood-hawker himself was slouched asleep against his pondokkie wall while his wife stooped over a washing tub full of soapsuds . Neither took any notice of the singers . Benjamin Segode looked at them carefully and counted the children  --  twenty or more of them sitting and standing in a little circle under the shade of a large willow . The tree grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailed its ragged branches over two more shanties standing back to back on the other side of the fence . The singing was led by a pretty white girl of fourteen or fifteen . She stood with her back to the tree , Bible in hand , and sunlight filtering through the leaves made bright moving dots on her white cotton dress and her blonde hair braided in two plaits over her shoulders . Benjamin stood at the edge of the bush . None of them had seen him . 0 die vrolike , o die salige Vredebringende Kersfeestyd . . . ? the child voices sang with a lilt-0 joyful and blessed , pcacc.bringing Christmas . tide . . Holy choirs of angels sing the happy news .. . He walked out towards the woman at the washtub until his shadow fell across the soapsuds and she looked up quickly . " Durnele , " he said quietly . He was listening .. " Dumela , Segode , " she greeted him , smiling . Then she caught the look in his eye and glanced across , suddenly scared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there trouble ? " she asked in a low voice . " Yon should know . " His gaze turned to the girl and her Sunday school . She did not follow his meaning . " Here is Benjamin Segode , " she sang out to her husband . The sleeping man stirred and settled back , his hat pushed still further over his face . " Are your children there too ? " Benjamin jerked his head toward the big tree . She was a little alarmed by the question and stood with the soapy water falling in drops off her fingers . Then she nodded . " My children and the other children . " " How can you sell them  --  are they cattle ? " " I do not sell my own children . Segode , what are you saying ? " She dried her hands on her apron , looking away from him , and walked with heavy steps to the pondokkie . " Wake up , " she touched her husband on the shoulder , " here is a visitor . " The woodseller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he held out a hand genially . " Dumela , brother . " " Damela . " " What brings us the good luck of this visit , Mr. Secretary ? " Benjamin warmed to the man 's good-natured manner . Be would have liked to squat at his side and smoke a cigarette with him there in the sun . But he stood back unbending . " Do your eyes see what mine do ? " he asked . " Brother , I think they do . " " That ? " And he pointed expressively with his middle finger at the circle of children and the white girl at the far end of the yard beyond the donkeys . The woodseller stood up . " Is there anything against that ? " He screwed up the corners of his eyes . " You must answer for yourself , " Benjamin said , feeling the heat and indignation rising up again in his veins . The woman had gone round to the other side of the pondokkie and he could hear her voice in a soft cooing tone call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . one out of sight . " Ay , here is our Vigilance secretary , Benjamin Segode . " Voices answered from the bush , quietly , like the note of the Cape robin . " It keeps the children out of mischief and no harm is done , " the wood-hawker conciliated . " You gave her permission to teach in your yard ? " The man nodded and tried to smile although he could see the secretary had brought a flame of anger to singe him . " No  --  you cut wood all day , " Benjamin said , " and you have a heart of wood and a brain of wood . Are you all the same  --  does your wifehave soapy water in her veins ? No harm is done ! You hand over to them the children of our people ; you , Washington Mahleke , sell your own flesh and blood for a morning on your back in the sun ! " " Hai , Segode ! " the woodseller cut in . " Why ca n't you keep them out of mischief yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach them the songs of our race that are forgotten here in this stinking marsh . Teach them to rise up out of the mud ! " The woodseller tugged his beard nervously . The secretary was a younger man than lie and , by rights , had no business to give him such a rating . But he drew a deep breath and said bitterly , " There is some truth in what you say , Segode . " B EN JAMIN waited in silence until their eyes met . He hated the indolence of people who could forget everything in a song or could dance the moon down into the gleaming ocean , dreaming of a full life , and of friendship and peace until the sun woke them up in the naked helplessness of their poverty . He saw his words had shaken Washington Mahleke and touched a hidden sore . Again he mopped his face with the red handkerchief and walked over to the Sunday school circle . The dry twigs cracked under his hoots . The children looked round to see who came , gladly letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and the white girl was reading to them from the Bible . Most of them were pure blacks but there were a few Cape Coloured children among them , and all could understand the language they spoke , which was Afrikaans . The girl was reading in Afrikaans and held open her Bible in both hands . A ray of sunlight shone through the stray whisps of her blonde hair on the pages of the Book . She paused , looking at Benjamin Segode with her bright greenish eyes . " Go on , " he said . She was reading from Genesis the story of the disinheriting of Ishmael , son of the Egyptian bondwoman . " ' And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian , which she had horn to Abraham , mocking : II She looked up from the page again and noticed the sinister smile of the black man . " Go on , " Segode repeated . " ' Wherefore she said to Abraham , Cast out this bondwoman and her son , for the son of this THE LITTLE bondwoman shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " The girl 's lips quivered and she could not read further . Benjamin Segode stepped between the sitting children and approached her . She had turned paler and watched him with a fixed look . He could see now she had brown freckles in the green of her eyes . They were firm , steady eyes , wide open and shining . Involuntarily she had pressed the open book against her bosom and waited , standing her ground . " Good morning  --  and who sent you here to do this ? " he said in English . " I 'm sorry , I do n't speak that language . " He repeated his words in Afrikaans with the thick overtone of a Basuto accent . He knew five languages and the babel of the new slums was easy to him . The girl frowned in the effort to decide whether she should answer a black man 's questions . Then she said honestly , " The Dominic sent me . " " What is your name ? " " Angelina du Preez . " " So the Dominic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heathens . ' Why does n't he come himself ? " " He is too busy  --  he has to preach to the white people at three services and baptize and teach the Catechism . " " He 's not afraid to come here ? " She flushed . " No , he is not afraid . " " He marks the Book for you and the chapters you must read and the hymns to sing ? " " Yes . " " And you believe in God and Jesus Christ and the Saints ? " She frowned again and decided not to answer . The strange , flickering smile of the man was beginning to freeze her . Black people were coming from all sides as if there were no reason for coming but simply a chance they happened along that way . Men with a jacket hung on one shoulder , a woman hitching up a baby in the blanket on her back , older children with long bare legs and bare feet shuffling in a half-dance through the sand . They all stopped in different groups when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one another , yet she felt they were watching her , listening to her every word . She was a long way , more than a mile , more than half an hour 's walk through the bush on heavy sand-paths to the nearest white man 's house . She could scream and her voice would be lost in the willows . " Does the Dominic also give you sweets for the children ? " Benjamin asked her . " No . " Her face clouded with bitter resentment at the unjust question . " I buy sweets for them out of my own pocket money . " Be turned to the children . " Do you like sweets on a Sunday morning ? " They did not answer but lowered their big wondering eyes to avoid his sneering look . They loved their little teacher and were troubled and a little panic-stricken by the manner and tone of the powerful secretary . " Let me see your Book ? " He waited to receive it . But she was suspicious and pressed it still tighter to her as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you afraid to let me see it  --  is it not a good book ? " " Yes , it 's the one and only Book . " S L 0 WL Y. and reluctantly she yielded up the Bible and he took it in both hands with the traditional African courtesy . To take anything with one hand was an affront to the giver . He saw it was marked in a number of places with little pieces of black ribbon , but he did not trouble to see what the Dutch Reformed minister had set for reading . It was easy to find in the great Book he had been brought up on a justification , or at least a point of argument , for almost anything  --  for peace as well as for violence and treachery , for avarice and deceit and hatred , or for love and goodness . He knew how oppression could be sanctified as the curse of God on Ham or the casting out of the sons of Ishmael and the choosing of Israel . It was not honest , it was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin closed the pages and held it flat between the palms of his hands . It was a finely printed Bible bound in black American cloth and with the paper edges tinted red . " Juffrou du Preez , we black people know this Book  --  do you understand ? We have had it for more than a hundred years , two hundred . It is full of good , it is written in a way the heart of a man understands . But I say we should put it away for a time . I mean that we do not accept it from you . Do you hear ? We do not believe you , we do not trust you  --  you , little girl , and your Dominies and your rich men and your soldiers and policemen . When Nve are equal and free we will take up the Bible again . Then we will be happy with it and no one will make us afraid . Is this understood ? " He raised his voice and she pressed her back against the tree with a sense of terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black people gradually closing up . " Is it understood ? " he demanded again . " 1 do n't understand . 1 have done nothing wrong . " " No , juffrou du Preez ? " he gave a short deep laugh ? " you have done right , by your own people . You have come here to capture our children as sla.ves . " " Aah , that is a terrible thing to say . It is not true , I vow and swear it is not true . " " Well , we have had enough . But your Dominic sends you to preach your laws . " " I have preached no laws . " " You think you are above us and can talk down to our children because your white Parliament has passed a hundred Acts to lower us . " " That is politics and I know nothing about it . I have never heard of such acts . If you say false things before these children , then I deny them and God is my only witness of the truth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her lips . But she spoke with a desperate courage , putting him into a rage . " The truth , the truth , " he shouted contemptuously , " Every lie is the truth for your kind . You twist everything to suit yourselves . " Somebody laughed in the crowd behind him , and from the menace in that laugh she felt her knees grow soft and tremble . Benjamin Segode handed her hack the Bible . " Nall vat : IOU Boek en trek ( take your Bible and clear out ) , " lie said in a controlled voice . She stood a moment pressing it to her thudding heart . " Trek , trek ! " he shouted . D WITHOUT knowing what she was doing she began to run . A little figure in white in the gleaming sunlight , her blonde hair braids tied with white ribbons flying out behind her and the Bible , black and red , clutched under one arm . The people in the wood-hawker 's yard parted to let her go . She ran past the iron washtub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door with a slender homemade pipe between his teeth . In a few seconds she was out of the yard and had plunged down one of the sandy paths into the tunnel of the bush . There she saw a single black man coming her way and in her panic she ran on straight toward him , almost into his arms . Surprised , he stepped aside , pushing into the wall of leaves , to let her pass . Her feet sank deepinto the sand at each step and running was like the cloying horror of a nightmare . Angelina du Preez did not know how long or how far she had run when she came to a stop . There was a taste of blood in her throat and her heart was knocking and jolting as if it would leap out of her breast . It was the first time she had ever felt like that . Her legs were weak and heavy almost as though detached from her body . Without knowing she began to run .. At first she listened for anyone who might be following her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush seeds ripening in the SUFI and the swish of leaves . That was all she could hear for a while , holding her breath ; that , and the drumming in her ears . Somewhere a cock crowed ; far off , out of sight , an airplane hummed in the sky . She longed just to catch sight of it , but the strip of sky above the path was narrow and gave her no view . She could not tell where she was or which way she should now go to get hack on the tarmac road , the cars passing , and the houses of white people . She changed her Bible into the other hand , thinking what to do . Trying to fix her bearings , she was certain of one thing alone  --  the direction from which she had run . Should she continue and trust to chance ? But doing so , she might stumble upon more bunches of strange , hostile pondokkies : she might encounter a skolly gangster drunk and treacherous on the lonely bush path . It was cowardly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her mind . " Cod help me , Lord Cod help me , " she prayed . In the vague , rustling emptiness with every bush watching her and maybe concealing something , she had nothing to grip on to , nothing but the thought of the little children she had come to teach and to know . Sunday after Sunday she had found them waiting for her . Surely they had grown to love her in their own way and no harm would come to her among them . It had been a foolish and mad thing to run away from the Native leader , for she had thus accepted his charge of wrong , of untruth and twisting . And in one minute of fear she had lost the children and undone the work and the first mission of her young life . How could she explain it ? If she were to set right her mistake she must go back and face the black people , whatever the consequences , whatever the danger and threat to her life itself . There was no other way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . T HE WAY back was easy to find . She simply turned and followed the path , going neither to right nor left . But at each step , at each sound from the bush , her courage sagged . Then , after what seemed a long time , she heard a murmur of human voices somewhere ahead , and she had to stop to let her heart slow down . The voices became louder as she continued . At last she reached the edge of the clearing near the woodseller 's fenced-in yard and peered out from among the foliage . Where she had taken her Sunday school class , under the same sheltering tree , the secretary was holding a meeting . He spoke slowly and expressively in a language she did not understand and hundreds of people in the yard responded to him with rumbling voices or with a sigh . They had their backs to her . The Native leader had turned her cowardly running away into a success for himself . On the edge of the crowd were the children , her children . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion among their elders . Slowly she walked out across the sand into the full sunlight . They noticed her at once . A murmur came from them and hundreds of dark faces turned toward her . The secretary stopped in the middle of his speech . Some of the children started talking excitedly but their elders hushed them . She came near the children and opened her mouth but her throat was dry and no sound emerged . Again she tried and said huskily , " Children , I have one more thing to say and one hymn to sing with you before I go today .... " She did not know how to continue and there was a silence . Then she said , " Will you listen to me , my children ? " A small boy hiding behind a companion piped up , " No ! " A faint rustle like a deep breath rose from the crowd . " Grade , will you listen to me ? " Angelina appealed . The people had their backs to her . . A little black girl with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " la , my . flonnatfie . " " No ! " shouted another shrill voice . Then one of the children picked up a wood chip and tossed it at the white girl . It grazed her sunburnt leg and left a slight scratch and a bead of blood . Another chip followed and another until in a moment they were all pelting her as hard as they could , laughing and jeering at her . Some chips hit her and some flew past . They did not hurt her ; she could not feel them . But the wound they made was deep in her breast . She stood there in the sunlight and bowed her head and began to cry . Benjamin Segode rushed from his place at the tree and stopped the children throwing wood chips . " Hai ! " he hissed at them furiously . " What is this  --  are you hooligans ? " The children shrank back among the people and the whole crowd fell quite silent . Some watched and some turned away their eyes while the white girl stood there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears ran down . her small face and dropped in the hot sand .
