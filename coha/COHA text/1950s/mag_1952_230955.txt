Exactly six months ago , the U.S. and its principal allies at Lisbon initialed the master blueprint for European defense . By the end of 1952 , they would mobilize the 50 combat divisions that Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower considered the rock-bottom minimum needed to contain a Soviet attack . During 1953-54 , if all went well , NATO 's armies would be doubled , its air force would reach near-parity with the Red air force . All did not go well . <P> Last week the whole painfully reconstructed system of U.S. military alliances , paid for in the main by higher U.S. taxes and devoted in the main to the defense of Europe , was gripped by a disheartening inertia that threatened not to wreck it , but to deflate it . There were sulks and angry words in many of the world 's capitals , and , as usual , it is the U.S. that is blamed most of all-the nation that pays the piper but is still unable to call the tune clearly . " The U.S. got us into this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. must bail us out . " <P> Each ally had its special squawk : <P> Great Britain , forced to choose between arms and exports , slowed down rearmament ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . " It is no part of our hopes or wishes , " observed Tory President of the Board of Trade Peter Thorneycroft to the American Chamber of Commerce in London , " that the citizens of the U.S. should tax themselves into poverty in order that their country might become the soup kitchen of the Western world . We want to pay our way . . . We ask a fair deal for our exporters . . . free and fair competition with your own producers . " It was Thorneycroft 's way of saying that high U.S. tariffs are partly to blame for Britain 's troubles . <P> Spain , a half-ally , half-wooed last year by Senator Pat McCarran 's " special " $100 million appropriation ( which President Truman has refused to deliver ) , was playing hard to get over the naval and air bases the U.S. wants . Franco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironclad guarantee that the U.S. will fly to Spain 's defense in the event of war with Russia . <P> Iran 's Parliament listened to hotheaded demands that Premier Mossadegh expel the U.S. Mission which helps train the 140,000-man Iranian army . Mossadegh let it be known that he might prefer Yankee dollars to Yankee soldiers . <P> France was the week 's prize squawker . The French government pulled a dismaying political tantrum because the U.S. said no to its request for an additional $625 million aid . The U.S. was willing to give the French $187 million more , and suggested that Paris should try to make ends meet on that . This $187 million is an addition to all other U.S. aid to France , which this year amounted to about $1 billion . Parisian hotheads leaked stories to the papers alleging that unless the U.S. paid up , France would 1 ) go bankrupt and possibly Communist , 2 ) pull out of Indo-China , 3 ) forbid German rearmament , 4 ) haul the U.S. before the NATO Council for welshing on its obligations . Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had promised to balance without increasing taxes , had been worked out on the assumption that the U.S. would fork over . Pinay sent French Ambassador Henri Bonnet to the State Department with an indignant protest . Said Bonnet afterwards : " The two governments did not see the question with the same eye . "
