Early one morning last week 30,000 Japanese , carrying wreaths , incense sticks and bits of white paper folded into the shape of flying cranes , poured into Nakajima Park in Hiroshima on the northern shore of the Inland Sea . The waning moon still hung in the brightening blue sky . There was no wind , and the promise of a hot day . Said one Japanese , looking skyward : " It was a morning just like this when the bomb fell . " <P> The crowd massed before a huge , circular grass mound under which are buried the thousands of unidentified victims* of the first A-bomb drop exactly 13 years ago . Green wreaths were soon piled about the mound ; a forest of incense sticks smoldered fragrantly . A bell tolled , signaling a minute 's silence-but some women wept aloud . Then , watched by the silent crowd , Hiroshima 's Mayor Tadao Watanabe released 800 doves . Ten black-robed Buddhist priests began a solemn , monotonous chant of prayers that would continue until sundown . <P> 644 Cranes . The crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data Hall , a chamber-of-horrors museum containing mementos of the day Hiroshima died . Others congregated around the 10-ft. statue of Schoolgirl Sadako Sasaki . Sadako was two years old when the bomb exploded , and only half a mile from the explosion 's center of impact . Yet she was apparently unharmed , and grew into a lively , likable child . In 1955 , one month before graduating from grammar school , she developed the extreme lethargy that is the forerunner of " atom sickness . " Hospitalized , Sadako began folding scraps of paper into flying cranes-Japanese legend holds that a sick person who makes 1,000 paper cranes will recover . Sadako got only as far as 644 , and died . <P> This year the memorial services were marked with a new bitterness . The Tokyo newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun editorialized : " We hope these commemorative events will bring home to those concerned with the dropping of the bomb that they were guilty of acts so shameful that Japan will never forget them . " Said Mayor Watanabe : " We now view the atom bomb dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime committed against mankind . " And he added : " We have become frightened . " <P> The Fright . What was frightening Japan was the sudden sharp rise in leukemia deaths among supposedly uninjured survivors . In the year preceding last week 's anniversary , 65 in Hiroshima and atom-bombed Nagasaki died of " atomic sickness . " In the previous twelve months , the total deaths had been 36 ; in the year before that , 20 . Another statistic was just as chilling : of 32,000 children born in Hiroshima in the past 13 years , nearly one in six was deformed or stillborn . U.S. Dr. George B. Darling of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission protests that " the incidence of abnormal births to parents never exposed to atomic radiation is higher than the layman suspects , and it 's understandable that when one of these occurs in a family with a history of radiation exposure , radiation should be blamed . " But Darling concedes : " We are trying to measure the effect of something new that nobody really understands . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
