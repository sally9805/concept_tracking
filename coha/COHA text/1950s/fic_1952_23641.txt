The Town Mouse A Story by Stephen Becker Drawings by John Groth H is watch had stopped early that morning and he had not bothered to set it ; but he knew it was after noon , probably close to one o'clock , when he saw the pheasant rise out of the cornfield and whirr off to the east and then glide down and strut and lose itself in the corn again . He sat facing the window and back from it , making room for the footrest , and he knew that it was after twelve because the others had been back from church a good while , more than an hour , and he knew that it was not yet one because the table had not been set . He had been reading the funnies , remembering the doctor 's joke about nothing more serious than the funnies for a month , and he did not know why he had looked up just then , but he had been in time to sec the pheasant rise . That was the kind of thing the doctor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor about that , the pheasant going with great speed and he sitting motionless near the window , watching the bird and feeling even more motionless as he watched it . That was a good one for the doctor , and he would tell him too about the stretch of the cornfields off to the top of the rise so that nothing beyond could be seen and all the world was a cornfield , and about the trains that beat by off to the east , and about saying east and west instead of left and right . He would tell him about being up at six , these mornings , and not minding , not feeling at all bad , and only feeling a little bad in the evenings about the whiskey ration , none beforedinner and only one after ; and even that was in the mind , not the body . " There 's nothing wrong with you that is n't wrong with the rest of us , " the doctor had said . " It 's only that you feel it more . In your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You want work in a gymnasium , or a body-building course , or you want me to prescribe a hunting trip to Canada when you have n't hunted for twenty years or maybe more , or a trip to Florida or Cuba , so even if you have n't got the time or the money you 'll know what it is you have to do and you 'll feel better about it all because then you can say to yourself , if anything happens I know just where to go . I know just what to do . " " I have some time , " he had said , " but I do n't have much money . " " Never mind , " the doctor said . " You wake up with the same foul taste in your mouth as the rest of us and you cough the same way because of the cigarettes you smoked the night before , and the night before that and the night before that , one cigarette after another because you were drinking and talking , and your chest feels stiff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell me you get winded climbing stairs . Add to that your worries , you probably worry because you have n't got the money to Lake the romantic cure and about God knows what else ? " " Well , " he had said , " I do n't really worry . " " Oh yes you do , " the doctor said , taking off his owl glasses and tapping the side of the desk with them . " I do n't , about myself , **34;1110;TOOLONG 41 cause I 'm not allowed to . " He grinned suddenly and slapped the white of his jacket . " This . The symbol . I only break down during epidemics , after five days and nights without sleep . " The grin went away . " But you worry . For a man of forty-eight you 're in fine health . But you read an article somewhere about the machine breaking down , and now a twinge is more than a twinge , it 's a flaw in some moving part which rubs up against some other moving part and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole mechanism falling apart . You do n't call it dying , but that 's what you mean . So you come to me . You say you have n't seen a doctor in fifteen years but now you come to me . You expect me to tell you to stop drinking and stop smoking and get to bed early and not work so hard . " He had laughed . " I suppose I do . " " Well , I wo n't , " the doctor said . " ' Name : Thomas Hatfield . Occupation : Actors ' Agent . ' I know a little about you . T know some of the people you work with , or at least used to . I do n't see your name in the paper so much anymore . Maybe times are tough for you now . " " A little , " he had said . " But I know something about you just the same , and about the people you work with . They live fast . A lot of them think . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of real lushes . One of them is my patient . So if I cut you out of all that you 'd die next year , the good part of you , instead of fifteen years from now , or maybe twenty or thirty . Do n't go around saying I said you had fifteen years to live . You may live to be a hundred . Anybody may . " " I do n't think I 'd talk much about it , " he had said , not smiling . " Of course nut . You take it , and yourself , and the world , and the medical profession , very seriously . Who 's your next of kin ? " " Good Lord . " " Oh , come on , " the doctor said . " Do n't make me impatient with you . I like you . You 'll live to be a hundred . Who 's your next of kin ? " " I have two sisters . " " Where ? " " In Iowa . " " On a farm ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor said . " Too good to be true . Bohemians . Actors . Blackening the fair name of New York City . All from farms in Iowa . " The doctor grinned again . Hatfield had grinned back . " Can you spare a month ? " the doctor said . " I do n't know , " he had said , speaking slowly and thinking fast as he spoke , thinking that Tibbetts was a little young to handle it all , or what was left of it all , but that Miss Parnell had been wih him now for almost twenty years and could keep Tibbetts out of trouble . Of course I can , he thought . I decided that weeks ago . I would n't be here if I had n't . " Yes , " he had said . " I can spare a month . " " I thought you could , " the doctor said . " It wo n't be a cure . There 's nothing to cure really except a way of life . But it wo n't hurt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that you 've done something , taken the proper precautions . Paid your respects to death . After that you wo n't be so afraid of falling apart because if you do it wo n't be your fault . You 'll have done the right thing and absolved yourself of all blame . You see what health consists of ? " What I really want to see is how much of a cure you can stand . " The doctor grinned again . N ow he lit a cigarette , thinking , four today , and looked out at the cornfield . Behind him he heard the dull clink of silverware on cloth . " Dinner be ready soon , " Marjorie said . " Fine , " he said . Henry snored from the sofa . " Henry , " Marjorie said , and then louder , " Henry . " " Yeah , " Henry said . " Dinner . " " Okay , " Henry said . They get along fine , Hatfield thought . They like each other fine , and this is a good comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Maybe they did fifteen years ago , but they do n't now . And Henry has a hired man , and they have a deep freeze and kill a steer and a hog once in a while , and plenty of eggs and milk , and nobody works Sunday . They sit around storing lip energy and not even noticing the prints and photographs and knickknacks and lamps and footrests , the antimacassars and accumulated magazines and the plates hungfrom the wall , all this that they spent fifteen years putting together just so they would n't have to notice it . They have neighbors they like and who like them , and they 're not too far from town to buy clothes and see movies , and that 's a big handsome car Henry has . I do n't know , he thought . I just do n't know . It 's too late for me . If getting up at six becomes a habit I 'll be lost for good . Once or twice a year , in the city , he did get up at six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then gone to bed early the next . He would wind it up , whatever it was that he was doing , in the middle of the second afternoon , eat then , as much as he could , close the blinds , and go to bed , feeling a little excited in spite of himself , a little exotic , and fall asleep before five and sleep until six the next morning . Then , still excited , still feeling exotic , he would get up and dress and leave the apartment and walk . Once he had walked to the markets , thinking that this was the thing to do . They were closing when he got there . Sometimes he went in the other direction , to the bridge . The bridge was good at that hour , not loaded up , not spoiled and dirtied by the cars , but shining steel-gray and bright with the sun behind him as he looked and the light glowing back at him from the trees on the Jersey side . And the night club . Shining back at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the early barges and tugs below him in the river , the river bright green and sometimes the sharp whiteness of a sail . Then the cars would begin , and the noise , and even the river would crowd up . Sometimes he went to the park and watched the pretty women ride , and the not-so-pretty women who seemed to have money , and the pretty and not-so-pretty men with both kinds . Then , that night , he would be up late again the way he always was , and it would be another six months until something came along . It was almost always work . " Dinner 's ready , " Eleanor said . " Henry , wake up . Dinner 's ready . " " Okay , " Henry said . Hatfield turned in his chair . He had been hearing the sounds , the women bringing bowls and platters from the kitchen . He watched Henry stand up and stretch and rub his eyes and smile . " Come on , Tom , " Henry said . " Never get healthy sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . He must weigh two ten , Hatfield thought . And looks about thirty . I weigh one sixty and look about forty-eight . But then can he juggle producers ? Can he take a producer in his left hand and a casting director in his right and make them fly like plates ? There are skills and skills . They sat at the table . Henry carved the roast . " What would you do if we said grace , Tom ? " Eleanor asked , smiling . Marjorie frowned . Hatfield laughed and looked at Eleanor . Do I look like her ? he thought . My hair is n't as gray ; but the nose is the same , sharp , strong , high-bridged and thick-bridged . Marjorie 's too , and the lines running out to the corners of the mouth . They have no chins , though . Not to speak of . Jack , I got a girl for you . Not a girl . A woman . Finest actress I ever saw . Talent , Jack , talent . Everything she does you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no chin . Henry 's got a chin , though . Henry 's got a chin you could hang a side of beef on . Got a man for you , Jack . Terrific . Absolutely the end . Biggest god damn chin you ever saw . But he does n't like blintzes , Jack . T HEY ate the roast almost in silence , and the boiled potatoes and green beans , the third Sunday dinner now , eating quickly and drinking the milk and passing the bread , butter , salt , pepper , radishes . Henry said that the hired man had gone to Meredith . Meredith was the town four miles away . Hatfield had been to Meredith once , the second week , with Henry , and had liked the nearly empty streets with the hot sun on them at three in the afternoon , and the cracking , long-ago-painted wooden store fronts , although he did not like the other store fronts so much , the brick or brick veneer or the concrete block , steel , and glass of the movie house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feed market and the hardware and the two clothes stores . " That one 's a Jew store , " Henry said , pointing , There was a shoe store and cobbler 's that Hatfield liked , and a saloon that he would have liked to see because it had the real , hand-carved , dark-stained , probably squeaking wooden doors , but he imagined it was not used much now . He did not like the garage and filling station or the auto parts shop or the new post office and electric building . At the edge of town there was a large and modern building , like a hospital or one of the new school buildings he had seen so many of from the train . " What 's that ? " he asked Henry . " Hospital , " Henry said . " State hospital . For the nuts . " Henry laughed . Then they had gone home . Now , at the table , Marjorie said that the hired man spent too much time in Meredith ; when did he clean his tools and oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day a week in town is not too much . Plates were passed for a second helping of the roast . Hatfield said he did n't think he would , thanks . He was thinking about Marjorie , wondering how she had come to violate the pattern , because the three of them had grown up in a good-sized suburb , and the sequence was usually suburb-city-suburb at twenty-year intervals , but Marjorie had made it suburb-country or suburb-farm and stopped right there , and Eleanor had gone with her , once the honeymoon was over . The honeymoon to Calgary , or Calgary Alberta , as Henry said , and Eleanor waiting for them when they got hack . Eleanor was understandable . The broken engagement and then the dramatic foolishness and the withdrawal from all men except those in novels and motion pictures . The perfect third wheel , Hatfield thought . A natural voyeur type and nothing will change her now . But Marjorie was not the same and was still not explained . Not that lie , Hatfield , cared much . It could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk and unshaved shouting obscenities at the young ladies half-hidden by parasols . Their mother had been like that . It was fear and disgust and pride and they called it sensitivity . Maybe not . Maybe Marjorie just married the man and not the kind of life and then went wherever the man went . And now she is a female squire , whatever that is called . " More peaches , Tom , " Marjorie said . " Thank you , " he said . " I will . " He had not noticed when they went from meat to dessert . 44 I-IARPER 'S MAGAZINE I suppose really there is no pattern , he thought . There is only what most of the people do , and you should never be surprised at the exceptions . There are so many exceptions . Thomas Hatfield , for example , who drank champagne for years and then Scotch and now rye when he can get it . And when his sister lets him have it . Two and a half weeks , he thought . Surprise for the doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They turned to look . " A woman , " Henry said . " Wonder what she wants . " " She 's just sort of wandering , " Eleanor said . " She does n't know if she wants to come in or not . " " She 's sure dressed fit to kill , " Henry said . He laughed . " She 's made up , " Eleanor said . Hatfield wondered why they never had coffee after a meal except breakfast . He lit a cigarette . Marjorie looked at him . " I 'll get an ashtray , " he said . " Here she comes , " Eleanor said . H ATFIELD went into the living room and took an ashtray from one of the end tables . He came back into the dining room and stood looking out the window . They all watched the woman cross the long bright green front lawn and come toward the door . She was about forty and walked carefully without looking up at the house . " I 'll talk to her , " Marjorie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door . No lips either , Hatfield thought . No chin , no lips . " I hope it 's not Meredith , " Marjorie said . The woman was at the bottom step . " Do many of them get out of Meredith ? " Hatfield asked Henry . " Some , " Henry said . " About twice a year . There was one came here last year . " " A great big man , " Eleanor said . " He came across the tracks and up toward the house and it was almost night . I was never so scared . " " I had the shotgun , " Henry said . Hatfield felt a heartburn begin . " This woman looks presentable , " he said . " Oh , that does n't mean a thing , " Eleanor said . " It 's Sunday . They probably were all dressed up anyway . " The woman looked up , finally , and saw Marjorie . The woman smiled . Marjorie opened the door halfway and said , " What do you want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back . " I hope I did n't interrupt lunch , " she said . " We were just finished , " Marjorie said . " What do you want ? " " I just wondered , " the woman said . " I just wondered . " There was a silence . " I just wondered it anybody here was going toward Illinois and could give me a lift , " the woman said . Marjorie said nothing . From where Hatfield stood , behind her , she did not seem to be looking at the woman . Then Marjorie said , " Just a minute . I 'll go see . I think somebody down the road is going to Illinois . You wait here . I 'll see . " She closed the door and looked at Henry . Henry nodded . She went by them into the living room , where the telephone was . Hatfield looked at Eleanor . Eleanor swallowed twice quickly . Her hands were clasped tightly . The knuckles and fingertips were white . Henry stood watching the woman . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped toward the door . " What for ? " Eleanor said . Hatfield shrugged . " Why not ? The sun 's high . It 's a nice afternoon . Summer comes but once a year . " " Be careful , " Henry said . " Some of them are pretty tough . They go crazy and you ca n't handle them . " Hatfield opened the door and smiled at the woman . " Hello , " he said . " Hello . " " I thought you might like to sit on the grass and talk , " he said . " It 's such a nice afternoon . " " All right , " she said . He closed the door behind him and walked down the steps . She turned when he reached the bottom step and walked out onto the lawn with him . " Right here , " he said . " In the sun . It 's lovely out . " " Yes , it is , " she said . She sat on the grass . Hatfield sat facing her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ? " he asked her . The smile went away . " I mean originally , " he said . " Oh , " she said . " Merton . " " Merton , " he said . " That 's not far from Little Fall . " " No . " " I 'm from Little Fall . " " That 's bigger than Merton , " she said . " Yes . " He drew on his cigarette and then reached toward his pocket . " Excuse me , " he said . " Would you like a cigarette ? " She looked surprised . " No , thank you . I do n't smoke . And if I did I would n't smoke on Sunday . " She smiled again . " But I do n't mind you smoking . " " Thank you , " he said . After a pause he said , " It 's a nice day for traveling . " " Yes , " she said . " It 's just fine . " " Have you come far ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hope you get a ride , " he said . " Yes . It would be nice . " T HE sun came down hot . Near Hatfield a grasshopper jumped . Suddenly Hat- field could hear the insect sounds , the buzzes , the scrapes , the whispers , and then he could hear the soft creaking of the trees . " Look at the grasshopper , " he said . She looked . " Yes . I like grasshoppers . " They were silent while Hatfield finished his cigarette . He flipped it away into the grass and watched it smoke . While he watched it he heard the far-off hum of a train . The hum grew louder . When the train made the bend and came into sight they both watched it pass . The high sun gleamed off the cars . When it was gone she said , " I like trains . " " Why did n't you take one to Illinois ? " Hatfield said . She looked away again , and then she blushed . Hatfield could see Marjorie looking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the woman said . " I do n't have enough money . " " I see , " Hatfield said . " I suppose you have some waiting in Illinois . " The woman nodded several times . " Yes . " " Is that why you want to go to Illinois ? " " It 's not the only reason , " she said . " Why else ? " She smiled . " I think I 'd like Illinois . It must he so green and peaceful in the country . Quiet like . You could be alone . " " It 's very much like right here , " he said . " Oh , no , " she said . " No . It could n't be . " He waited , and then said , " And Chicago ? " " Oh , yes , " she said . " I 'd like Chicago . Tall , and all glass and shiny . And the people must be so friendly . " She looked sad . " I heard that people in big cities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatfield said . " Perhaps city people are friendly because they have to live with so many other people . " " Maybe that 's it , " she said . " It must be fine . " " That 's what I thought once , " he said .. He rolled a blade of grass between his fingers . " I live in New York , you know . " " New York . That 's a long way off . " " Yes . I went to Chicago when I was very young . " She smiled . " I liked it , " he said . " I liked the buildings , high and you could see the lake from them , and I liked the streets , the people . Even then the people were in a hurry . They would race up and down in the morning and then at lunch and then at night and not even look over toward the lake . They hurry more now . But they hurried some then and I used to stand and watch them . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the streets watching the people and I would stay too long and he late getting back to work . They were like different colors , the people . The big yellow Swedes and the brown Italians and the blue-gray Germans . Now I do n't see the colors any more . But then it was fine , and they were all different to me , and sometimes they would speak their own languages going by . That would amaze me . I could tell German because they spoke it in the beer garden , and then I could tell Yiddish and then Italian , and I could tell the Scandinavian languages but I could never tell Swedish from Norwegian . Once I followed two men for ten blocks on State Street because I had never heard the language before , and every block I decided I would stop them and ask them but I never did . I was scared . Now I think it was Hungarian but I 'll never be sure . " And the people used to change with the season . It was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in December it was a real . city , crowded and noisy and dirty and the people packed in together , as though it would keep them warm . " " I did n't know there would be so many foreigners , " she said . He looked at her . " But that 's what a city is . Not just where the most people are . Not just the buildings . It 's where all things come together . Do you see ? " " Oh , yes , " she said . " I see . " " I was there five years , " he said . " In Chicago . Five years is a long time , so I got tired of it . Then 1 went to New York and after a year of New York I forgot about Chicago . It was as though I 'd never been in Chicago . Later I decided it was because cities are a lot the same . The streets in New York were different and the individuals were different but it was the same kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I felt at home as soon as I knew the streets . Because the people were the same , you see . So I felt as though I had spent the whole six years in New York . " " Maybe I 'll feel that way about Chicago , " she said . " Then I got a good job and then I had my own , uh , business . So I was really part of it . " She was staring up at the sun . " I was a part of other people , " he said . " That 's what it was . That 's what we started to talk about , is n't it ? " After a moment she lowered her head . " Oh , yes , " she said . " That would be nice . But Iwould n't want to bother anyone . But it seems to me that Illinois would be so nice . " So , Hatfield thought . That 's all you want ? No burnished throne , no perfumed sails , no cloth-of-gold of tissue ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothin 's plenty for you . Just let me be in Illinois , and then just let me be . Was that it with me ? Was I like that ? And why the hell do I sit here talking about it , and to myself at that ? Still , he thought , breathing deeply , still , it seems to me there was more I wanted to say . H E WAS watching her fingers pluck grass when the car turned in the driveway and drove toward the house . She looked up at it and her eyes widened as she smiled . " Why , maybe that 's it , " she said . " Maybe that 's the man who 's going to Illinois . " They stood . The car came up to them and stopped , and two men got out . The woman stiffened and took Hatfield 's arm . He could feel her fingers against his upper arm . " Hello , Mr. Riddick , " one of the men said . " I 'm not Mr. Riddick , " Hatfield said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have to bother him , " the man said . He stepped toward the woman . Turning to look at Hatfield , the woman dropped her hand front his arm . He watched the terrible sadness come into her face , coming out from behind the eyes , from deep back , from a long way off , from a long time ago . He watched it change her whole face . She looked at him without moving . Ile looked away . " Come on , " the man said . The woman moved then . She walked slowly away from Hatfield and toward the car . The man who had not spoken held the rear door open . She got into the car and the man slammed the door shut . He took a key from his pocket and locked the door from the outside . " Site gets away about three times a year , " the first man said . " We 'll try to see that she does n't bother you again . Wants to get to Illinois . God knows why . Same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man laughed . " I suppose it is , " Hatfield said . " Well , thank Mrs. Riddick for me . Tell her well try to keep this from happening again . " " I 'll tell her . " AIIM " ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? The man got into the driver 's seat and his assistant got in next to him . The two doors slammed , and the car backed down the drive . Hatfield could not see the woman . He went into the house . " I 'm glad that 's over , " Henry said . " Never know what they 're up to . " " You kept her very quiet , Tom , " Marjorie said . " Yes , " Eleanor said . " You were very good with her . What did she want ? " Hatfield said , " She just wanted to go to Illinois . What she said when she first got here . " He was seeing her face , at the end . " Crazy woman , " Henry said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marjorie said . " I suppose so , " Hatfield said . " They get queer notions , " Marjorie said . " The trouble is , the city would have broken her , " Hatfield said , earnestly and not to anyone . " You have to be whole and alive or it buries you . " " I do n't see what she wanted to go to Illinois for , " Henry said . " No different there than here . " " Sounds queer enough to me , " Eleanor said . " She ought to learn to be happy where she is , " Marjorie said , " She 'd do all right in Chicago , though , " Henry said . " All the nuts . " ATFIELD looked at him . Then he looked H at them all , and he felt it drop away from him , leave him , the devil within him , the beast on his back . He smiled at them . He lit a cigarette and walked into the kitchen . Springy step , he thought . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here one speaks Hungarian . He hummed a little as he took the bottle from the pantry and set it on the kitchen table . He took the icetray from the refrigerator and ran water over it , and then knocked loose three cubes . He put the cubes in a glass and left the icetray in the sink and then poured from the bottle until the ice in the glass was covered . Marjorie came in . " Tom ! " she said . " At lunch ? And so much ? You put that right back and wait till tonight . " She reached for the glass . Almost smiling , not really seeing her , Hatfield slapped her hand away hard with the back of his own . Looking then into her cold , horrified eves , he drank half his drink . He turned then , and went out of the kitchen and started up the stairs to his bedroom . I 'll get in late tomorrow night , he thought , or maybe early Tuesday morning .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
