" The platypus is the most touchy , temperamental , unpredictable animal , " says Australia 's David Fleay , and he should know . Called " the platypus man , " Fleay is the world 's leading authority on one of the world 's strangest animals , and the only man who has ever made the furry , duckbilled , egg-laying protomammals breed in captivity . Last week Fleay was grooming two juvenile platypuses for shipment to New York 's Bronx Zoo , and he hoped that they would travel by air . <P> When he took three of them to New York by sea in 1947 , says Fleay , " it was one of the most trying times I have ever been through . " He had chronic dyspepsia for a year " due to those blasted platypuses . " <P> Adult platypuses are set in their ways , so Fleay decided to catch young ones and condition them to human company before committing them to The Bronx . During the breeding season , female platypuses dig long tunnels into the banks of Australian streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends . When the young platypuses hatch , they grow fast and fat by licking the milk that exudes from pores on their mother 's belly . They begin to come out of their burrows in January and start life on their own . <P> Double Splash . After getting a rare permit from the Australian government to catch platypuses , which are rigidly protected , Fleay made 22 sorties from his home in West Burleigh , Queensland . Tramping along the streams in a moving cloud of mosquitoes , he watched for the ripples stirred by swimming platypuses and listened for the characteristic double splash they make when they hit the water . In likely places he set funnel-mouthed box traps , caught a few adult platypuses and lots of eels and catfish . <P> On Jan. 22 he saw a baby female platypus puddling in the mud on the bank of the Albert River . The platypus saw Fleay and disappeared into a crevice , but a trap caught her during the night , and Fleay named her Pamela . Three days later he caught a male baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with resignation , but Paddy , another male , captured on Feb. 10 , protested in a way that worried Fleay , who feared that Paddy might never see The Bronx . <P> Live Food . Back at West Burleigh , Fleay began the delicate job of conditioning the platypuses for life in The Bronx . They were installed in a Fleay-designed platypusary with a water tank and grass-lined burrows that simulated as closely as possible their natural habitat . Every afternoon Fleay took them from the burrows and put them in the tank . He encouraged visitors ( " It helps them get accustomed to people and noise " ) . <P> The big problem is food . Platypuses eat half their weight daily , and they demand live food . So every day Fleay dispenses 2,000 earthworms . 200 meal grubs , 30 crayfish , chafer grubs and crickets . Favorite item with the growing platypuses : small , wriggling grubs that Fleay raises under his house in bran and meal moistened with beer . <P> Pamela and Paul responded to pampering . They performed for the visitors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the fun . He often swam upside down to show his displeasure .
