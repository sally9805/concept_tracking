txt Congressional Democrats are finally crawling out of their foxholes and beginning to talk back to Senator McCarthy . For some three months they have been sitting tight in those foxholes . Senator McCarthy seemed to them to be a whole series of time bombs . No one could predict when he would explode , in what direction the explosive force would move , or the power of the explosion . It seemed wiser and safer to let him have his fling . Now it 's different . The difference is that . the explosive senator from Wisconsin has been channeled into what is both a promising and also a politically safe direction ? relatively . Of course , he may not remain channeled . He is totally unpredictable . as his closest Republican friends are the first to admit  --  and ruefully . But the course of the whole McCarthy affair has taken a new turn which is going to be interesting , which may well come up with some real " spy " sensations from the past , and which can do relatively little political damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Department and toward the Amerasia case . Originally the State Department was the target . No one can ever accuse Senator McCarthy of not trying to find card-carrying Communists in the State Department . His efforts had the effect of making the department 's own security staff work overtime on-the same task . The department roster , which already had been combed half a dozen  --  times , has been given another thorough combing since then , with every possible assistance from the FBI . But so far the total factual result of this researching of the department is to disclose one unresolved question about one individual ? John Stewart Service . The reexamination of Mr. Service is now going on . Except for this case , which was being reexamined independently of Senator McCarthy , the McCarthy leads all have led to persons who were not in the State Department , or who had been dismissed long ago , or who had been cleared after careful examination . So far as the State Department is concerned , the affair comes pretty close to being-ended . A A A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more attention has been directed toward the Amerasia case . Here , plainly , is something worth looking into . Amerasia was a magazine . On June 6 , 1945 , its offices in New York City were , raided after it had printed an article which paralleled a secret OSS report so closely as to arouse suspicion . The raid uncovered a considerable quantity of classified government documents . The case was brought to trial on a Saturday morning under circumstances which would make it appear that unusual efforts were taken to hush the whole thing up . Six defendants were indicted originally , but only two ever were brought to trial . The government attorney recommended against jail sentence . No evidence ever was intro- duced into the court record to show that one of the defendants , Philip Jaffe , had a long Communist Party record , although voluminous information of this character existed . Why ? The committee set up to investigate the McCarthy charges intends to find out the answer ? if it can . A A A Here is a worthy project in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the case was hushed up to try to keep the Russians from learning at the time that their spy net had been broken and its members were known to our intelligence agents . But the case might prove more interesting . It also might turn out that it was considered impolitic at the time to have a Russian spy story breaking in Washington when official relations were still friendly . Also , it might have been something more sinister . But it is an unexplained mystery . It 's high time that it be explained . Its explanation might clear a number of innocent persons of wrong suspicion as well as . expose some who were guilty of espionage for a foreign government . It also could serve as a useful escape valve for the head of steam generated by the heat of the whole affair . With this prospect ahead , and the failure so far to make good on the case against the State Department behind , Democrats now are willing for the first time in three months to take a chance on talking back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
