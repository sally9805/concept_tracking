txt A flash strike halted . hundreds of New York taxicabs late yesterday afternoon and union leaders warned that one-third of the city 's cabs might be tied up by this morning . The strikers will return to their jobs this afternoon , but they threatened to renew their stoppage on a broader scale next week , and to repeat it at weekly intervals after that . Union spokesmen asserted that each walkout would continue for twenty-four hours and would get " bigger and bigger " un- ' til the taxicab operators agreed to union recognition and higher pay . Industry leaders declared their determination to fight the union in the courts . They contended that it had no strength among the cab drivers and was seeking to " foist " itself on the fleet owners by coercive methods . The unannounced walkout aggravated the normal late-afternoon scramble for cabs in mid-Manhattan . The situation was made worse by a heavy downpour that increased the number of cab-seekers . However , the shortage was not nearly so acute as on the first day of New York 's last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 90 per cent of the cabs were off the streets . Police Figure Disputed The Police Department reported that out of a city - wide total of 11,795 cabs , 1,003 were idle at 6 P. M. yesterday . Taxi operators insisted the police report was based on union figures . Employers estimates put the number of idle cabs at 300 . The strike represented the first " coordinated " ? thrust by a union that began organizing taxi drivers here a year - ago . The union is Local 102 of the United Automobile Workers , A. F. L. , which : has been under investigation , in recent , weeks by a special committee of the American Federation of Labor executive council because . it IS headed by an ex-convict . The union leader is " John Dioguardi , alias Johnnie Dio , who was convicted in 1937 of extortion in the garment trucking racket . Mr. Dioguardi is general organizer of Local 102 and president of a sister union , Local 649 . In announcing the strike call , Mr. Dioguardi assailed as a " vi. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with " legitimate " objectives . He said the union 's sole goal was to win contracts providing improved pay and working conditions for the drivers . The union wants the fleet ownem to agree to pay the drivers commissions equal to 50 per cent of the amount recorded- on their meters . Most fleets now pay a 44 per cent commission , and a few of the larger fleets pay 45 per cent . The union contends that the total earnings of hackmen , in tips and commissions , has declined // since the city authorized a 27 per cent increase in taxi fares last July : According  --  to the union , the fare rise has meant fewer riders and smaller tips . Mr. Dioguardi , said that 2,800 drivers ' In eighteen garages in Manhattan , Brooklyn , the ? Bronx and Queens had responded to the strike call in. the , first hour . He predicted - the number would rise to 8,000 in fifty garages by this morning. - About 3,500 cabs would be affected if the union carried out its plan . Louis E. Cohen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dioguardi 's figures on both the actual and prospective impact of the strike . He said the walkout had been " a dismal failure . " A telephonic check among the garages indicated that " fewer than 300 cabs " were tied up , and that 800 were on the streets , the employer attorney said . He added that pickets had " grown disgusted " at several garages and gone away . Mr. Cohen said the employers would seek court injunctions today to prevent further picketing . The applications will be based on the contention that the union is not entitled to strike or picket - while it has petitions pending before the State Labor Relations Beard and the National Labor Relations - Board seeking certification as bargaining agent . The union said it was willing to call off its strike against any fleet that agreed to an election conducted under the auspices of the Federal or state board . The employers have been opposing elections on the ground that the union is " unrepresentative . " In the year since it was formed , the union has been unable to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual garages , but yesterday 's wal-xout was the firet , On , a-city- ; wide basis . The largest of , the garages was that operated by the Skyview Transportation Coinpany , at 23-10 Forty-fourth Read , , Long Island City , Queens . It has 200 cabs , and 500 drivers . There has been little union organizaion among New York cab drivers since the 1949 strike , which was called by the Taxi Workers Organizing Committee of . John L. ' ' Lewis ' United Mine ' Workers . The Lewis-backed strike ended after nine days in a complete Tout of the union . Virtually all the drivers returned to their jobs without waiting for , the union to give the back-to-work signal . One of the greatest obstacles to successful union organization in the hack industry is that more than half the cabs are operated by owner-drivers . Another obstacle is , the large number ? of part-time drivers , who spend most of their working hours . at other jobs and drive a cab one ? or two nights al week . It ? is estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers in New York fall into this category . Three hundred strikers , meeting last night at Werdermann 's ' Hall , Sixteenth Street and . Third Avenue , voted to limit the walkout - to twenty-four hours . Mr. Dioguardi told the group the recent increase in taxi fares had meant " more money for the bosses and less for you .
