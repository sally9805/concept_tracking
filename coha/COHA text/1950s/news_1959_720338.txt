txt Defeat of an administration bill for a 1-cent-a-gallon hike in the gasoline tax by the Massachusetts House of Representatives constitutes a major rebuke to Governor Furcolo and his Department of Public Works . While the Governor may recoup his political fortunes later by jamming through his earlier-proposed " ? cent-a-gallon tax hike , the Democratic-controlled House has shown it is in no mood to continue to pass administration bills  --  at least tax bills  --  on a " pass-it-now , thinkabout-it-later basis . " Representative John F. Thompson ( D ) of Ludlow , Speaker of the House , and close Furcolo associate , had planned to jam the gasoline tax bill through the House in one marathon sitting on March 24 , using the same tactics employed earlier on the withholding tax measure . Bloc Defeats Plan But a Republican-Democratic bloc foiled the plan . After considerable maneuvering on both sides , the bill was finally rejected on a 151-68 roll call vote . A total of 65 Democrats voted against the leadership in siding with 86 Republicans to kill the bill . The weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furcolo administration 's political stock on Beacon Hill at the moment . Many observers attribute it to continued failure to deal effectively with the Legislature , both branches of which are controlled heavily by Democratic majorities . To these observers the Furcolo administration has been heavy-handed in its dealings with the Legislature . On the gasoline tax issue the Governor himself advocated in his budget message a L-cent-agallon increase in the present 51 ; r-cents-a-gallon state gasoline tax . But within a few days the State Department of Public Works said a 1-cent hike was needed to keep pace with mounting maintenance costs . Although Senator James J. Corbett ( D ) of Somerville and Representative Harold C. Nagle ( D ) of Fall River . Senate and House chairmen , respectively , of the Legislative Committee on Highways and Motor Vehicles , filed the 1-cent bill , obviously for the department , spokesmen for neither the department nor the Governor 's office appeared at the hearing on the measure . Another Try Later ? ' Yet within a short time after close of the hearing the bill came out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the House Committee on Ways and Means gave it almost as scant consideration before reporting it favorably . The House originally voted 98 to 20 on a standing vote to reject the measure . The leadership swiftly engineered a dinner recess . obviously in an effort to recoup its forces . But on the final vote the margin was 151 to 63 against the bill , with only one Republican joining 67 Democrats in backing it . Another round in the gasoline tax fight is anticipated later . The Governor 's own measure for a 1 ; - cent- a- gallon increase is still in committee . It can be brought out later , if and when the House appears more ready to go along with a gasoline tax increase . This measure might well be passed eventually because legislators could easily hold that while they did not believe a 1-cent increase necessary , they had to vote for a 12-cent hike to insure proper maintenance of the expanding state highway system . Massachusetts labor leaders , Americans fur Democratic Action representatives , Democratic legislators , and college tax experts today opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent limited sales tax . Following two days of hearings before the Legislative Committee on Taxation , given over to proponents , the committee opened hearings to the opposition , with opposing legislators leading off . Senator Robert P. Cramer ( D ) of Williamstown , chairman of the Legislative Committee on Taxation , experienced difficulty in preventing the antisalcs tax crowd from applauding vigorously every sally against the levy . Finally , after threatening to clear the hearing room , Senator Cramer apparently gave up efforts to prevent applause traditionally barred at legislative hearings . Tynan Remark Cheered Representative John T. Tynan ( D ) of Boston , charged that the Furcolo administration - has done what he Republican Party could n't do I or 150 years ... for 150 years the Republican Party attempted to place a tax on those who can least afford CO pay . " lie was cheered when he shouted , " Labor is going to make you fellows do the right thing . " Challenged to show what could be clone if the sales tax is defeated . Mr. Tynan said , " The solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . " However , observers recalled that Mr. Tynan over the years has voted for heavy spending measures . J. William Belanger. president of the Massachusetts State Labor Council , AFL-CIO. opposed the sales tax as a burden on those least able to pay . Ile advocated the council 's program of income tax increases to produce revenue proved needed . Platform Recalled Referring to the sales tax . Mr. Belanger said : " This regressive tax hurts because it is the consumer who pays . It 's like passing the buck . When we talk of a 120-million-dollar to 200-million-dollar take in this state we must realize that it will come out of the consumer dollar and , incidentally , will reduce the purchasing power by that much , because it conies out of the same pockets . " Prof. Edward K. Smith , Boston College economist and fiscal adviser to Lt. Gov . Robert F. Murphy , forecast that if the limited sales tax is passed , - within three years the cry of crisis will again be raised and more articles will be taxed or rates increased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state level , have a way of breeding upon them elves . " Professor Smith said that Mr. Murphy asked him to tell the committee that the Democratic platform forthrightly opposed the sales tax , any sales tax , and that " all Democrats should keep faith with that platform . That calling something a crisis does n't change the fundamentals ; that Democrats should value courage above expediency and integrity above faithlessness . " The Boston College economist called for slashing of the state budget first . Pointing out that the record high 454-million-dollar budget is 46 million dollars higher than the previous budget , Professor Smith said , " it should be cut and under no circumstances should new taxation be advanced until our needs for fiscal 1960 are determined . " When Professor Smith was challenged to show where Governor Furcolo 's hidget could be cut , he pointed out that " 36 per cent of the recommended budg et goes for wages . The state spends twice as much per capita for personnel as many states such as Illinois and Ohio . I wonder if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pushing for income tax increases as an alternative to a sales tax if additional revenue is needed , Professor Smith said " we can already see that tax collections are running 10.7 mil lion dollars ahead of the estimates . We will also see a larger jump in income tax revenue because of yithholdiog . It is not unlikely that 50 million dollars or more above the estimates will come in . " Malcolm McCabe , executive secretary of the Massa  --  huscits Retail Grocers Association , opposed the sales tax , pointing oiit that 500 items sold in food stores would be taxed , causing a problem in separation of taxable and nontaxable items at checkout star ions . Furthermore , Mr. McCabe said that there arc more than 500.000 persons in Massachusetts over 65 years of age who will be subject to the tax even : hough they arc living on limited income . He added that 50,000 hardcore unemployed in the state and their fatuities will be heavily hit by the sales tax .               @ @ @ @ @ @
