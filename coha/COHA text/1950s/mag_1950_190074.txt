" It 's not a question of who will win , " said Sid McMath with a jaunty grin . " Instead , it 's a matter of adding to our majority . " Handsome , breezy Sidney Sanders McMath , a hot rock from Hot Springs , was out to win his second term as governor of Arkansas . <P> He hustled around the state in a chartered plane , reciting his achievements and promising more of the same . At every stop he also took a couple of lusty licks at Benjamin Travis Laney , the wealthy , 53-year-old former governor and Dixiecrat leader who had come out of political retirement to seek a third term and save Arkansas from Sid McMath and those Fair Deal radicals in Washington . Everywhere McMath went , he wore the same old blue suit , red tie and dilapidated Panama . He pumped the hands of the menfolk and introduced himself with a hearty " I 'm Sid McMath . " For the women , it was always a silken " I 'm Sid McMath , honey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters , McMath mailed a gaudy , eight-page comic book relating the saga of 38-year-old Sid McMath . There was McMath the poor boy , born in a dogtrot cabin on an Arkansas farm ; McMath the amateur boxer , and honor student at the state university ; Major McMath the Marine Corps hero , with the Silver Star for bravery on Bougainville ; McMath the racket-busting prosecutor who cleaned up gambling in Hot Springs ; McMath the family loving governor. * <P> McMath made mu:h of what he was going to do for Arkansas in the way of schools , roads and public works . It was good campaign talk in a state that runs 47th in many measurements of standards of living . Arkansawyers have a wry joke about it : " Thank God for Mississippi . " <P> When Dixiecrat Laney tried to picture Sid McMath as a traitor to the South , supple Sid declared against such pet Truman projects as FEPC and compulsory health insurance , but still capitalized on his closeness to Harry Truman . Ben plaintively confessed that he had never learned " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before primary day admitted : " He has had only 18 months in which to make political enemies . I had four full years . " <P> Last week Arkansas voters went to the polls , by a two to one majority gave Glamour-Boy McMath his second term in office , and a feeling that the best of his career was still ahead of him . <P> * Not shown in the happy family strip : the shotgun killing of McMath 's father by Sid 's wife Anne . It happened in 1947 , while McMath was prosecutor . His father , drinking heavily , had threatened Anne ; a grand jury called it justifiable homicide .
