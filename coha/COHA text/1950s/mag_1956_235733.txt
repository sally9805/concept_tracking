Few newspapers in the Deep South have handled the hot desegregation story with the courage of South Carolina 's Florence Morning News ( circ. 14,219 ) . Its outspoken editorials repeatedly appealed for moderation and good will in solving the South 's toughest problem . But last week-by its editor 's decision after two years of threats and pressure-the subject of desegregation was banned from the News editorial page . <P> Editor John Howard O'Dowd , 29 , a home-grown Florentine and a graduate of The Citadel , set the News 's moderate tone right after the Supreme Court decision . He set down his doubt that the court 's intention could be thwarted , warned that " this can not and will not be done with speeches that inflame groups and excite the passions of extremists . " <P> Abuse . Editor O'Dowd , whose father John Michael O'Dowd is publisher and owner of the News , kept his news columns as open as his mind . Recent example : the arrest and release last month of Clarence Mitchell , Washington head of the N.A.A.C.P. , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The News ( one of the first papers in the South to run pictures of Negroes ) ran Mitchell 's picture on the front page with a story that began : " Traditional race segregation in Florence lost its first court test yesterday . " <P> For its views the News has drawn violent abuse . One night last spring a voice threatened O'Dowd on the telephone : " This is the Klan . We 're going to get you . " When the editor drove away from his office at 2 a.m. , a car chased him , pulled alongside him three times to force him into the curb , until he shook it by turning into a side street and dousing his lights . City Editor Charles Moore went to cover an out-of-town Klan meeting , was punched and chased away . While covering a basketball game , Baptist Minister L. B. Ballard , who is the News 's church editor and assistant sports editor , had the rear tires of his car slashed . On his way home , after getting them fixed , two cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . <P> Along with violence and threats , the News was hit by reader complaints and cancellations . In February circulation showed a loss for the first time in years . Early in March the county Democratic convention passed a resolution denouncing the News as the " carpetbagger press . " In electing delegates to the state convention , the group pointedly rejected Editor O'Dowd , who ran 45th in a field of 45 . <P> Abdication . That was the last straw . Fortnight ago O'Dowd announced " a retreat from reason " in a long editorial . " It has become obvious , " he wrote , " that to maintain effectiveness in other important areas of thought , this newspaper must abdicate its position in the segregation controversy . We have seen the situation as being insoluble in the hands of extremists , and have sought men of good will who can sift the elements of right from the chaff of unreason on both sides of the conflict . But men seeking the fair solution have not , in two years , come forward . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scorn and abuse of those on the extreme fringes . . . Editorials that do not speak sedition , bigotry , white supremacy and incitation to legislative folly and physical violence are not accepted as ' honest ' or ' courageous . ' "
