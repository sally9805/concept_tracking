Manhattan 's Daily Worker teamed up with the Chinese Reds to try an old propaganda trick . Under a Peking date line , the Worker last week front-paged a schedule of " news broadcasts by U.S. prisoners of war over Radio Peking , " giving the names , ranks and addresses of 18 G.I.s and officers , who are allegedly prisoners of the Chinese Communists and presumably ready to do some talking . <P> The listing was obviously bait for every U.S. family with a son reported missing in Korea , since it was the only way the names of prisoners come out . The Chinese Reds have refused to turn over names of prisoners to the International Red Cross , as required by the Geneva Convention ( which Peking wo n't ratify ) . <P> The Red propaganda was also abetted by the pro-Commie weekly National Guardian . Last week it printed a list of 155 names of supposed U.S. P.W.s , the Guardian 's seventh such list to date . Several have included statements allegedly from P.W.s condemning the Korean war . Guardian Editor Cedric Belfrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had spied for Russia , claimed that his source of names was the Red-lining China Monthly Review of Shanghai ( formerly the China Weekly Review-TIME , July 17 ) . <P> The Worker 's source was Correspondent Alan Winnington , who covers the Communist forces for the London Daily Worker . When Winnington 's British P.W . reports began running in the London Worker months ago , irate M.P.s shouted " Treason ! " and demanded that the government take action . Suddenly , the London Worker found itself " too crowded with other news " to run the lists .
