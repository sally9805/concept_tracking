Good melodrama succeeds in making its characters and plot believable . When they are not , one way for moviemakers to try for some credibility is to take the camera to the actual scene of the fictitious crime . Latest examples : <P> Union Station ( Paramount ) stages a police hunt for kidnapers through Los Angeles ' railroad terminal , elevated trains , stockyards and municipal tunnel . After methodically nabbing three members of the gang , the cops ( William Holden , Barry Fitzgerald ) undertake the ticklish job of smoking out its leader ( Lyle Bettger ) before he can do away with his hostage , a blind teen-age girl ( Allene Roberts ) . <P> Actor Fitzgerald 's Irish whimsy leavens his role of a wise old police inspector , but the rest of the characters are cut &; dried . Holden seems miscast as a railroad detective with a reputation for toughness . Since he and Heroine Nancy Olson begin to bicker almost as soon as they meet , cinemaddicts will instantly sense a case of love at first sight .

Detective Conte , who has had a couple of years of medical school and some service with the Army medics , gets permission to practice on the patients so that he can track down a killer in the hospital . <P> It develops that the hospital harbors not only a fake doctor and a murderer , but also a cozy illegal traffic in narcotics . To square a beef by New York City authorities , Actor Conte announces in a foreword that the story never really happened . The movie itself then makes the point perfectly clear . Though it never rises above routine crime fiction , the film gains considerable interest simply from Bellevue and the city streets and the Manhattan skyline .               @ @ @ @ @ @
