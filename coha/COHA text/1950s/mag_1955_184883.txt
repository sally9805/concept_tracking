Even Frenchmen who are tolerant of governmental didoes were disgusted . The nation 's top military officer was openly urging sabotage of the Premier 's policies , the Defense Minister was defiantly declaring disagreement with the Premier 's decisions , army officers and ministers were flouting the Premier 's instructions . <P> The issue was Premier Edgar Faure 's desperate attempt to provide a policy for rebellious Morocco . Two weeks ago , his Cabinet had announced agreement on a program of which the chief features were removal of Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Moulay Arafa and his replacement by a three-man regency council . President Coty himself sent a letter to the Resident General , Lieut . General Pierre Boyer de Latour , for delivery to Arafa ; a French destroyer stood by to carry the aged Sultan to sanctuary in Tangier . <P> Off to the Virgins . In the two weeks since , the government of France has all but fallen apart . Foreign Minister Pinay objected that he had not been consulted on the wording , and President Coty 's letter was withdrawn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opposition to the whole plan . Deputies demonstrated in the Assembly , and Pierre Montel , chairman of the Assembly 's Defense Committee , flew to Morocco to urge Sultan Arafa to refuse to leave the throne . Marshal Alphonse Juin , NATO 's Central European commander and France 's top military man , publicly denounced Faure 's plan as " appeasement " and rallied other old North African veterans to his cause . Summoned to a Cabinet meeting , De Latour angrily stomped out , complaining that every time Minister of Tunisian and Moroccan Affairs Pierre July told him to do one thing , Minister for Veterans Raymond Triboulet warned him not to do it . De Latour was at liberty , Triboulet explained , to obey whichever Minister he considered his superior . <P> In U.S. terms , it was roughly as if President Eisenhower , having decided on the removal of the Governor of the Virgin Islands , found Secretary of Defense Wilson announcing his opposition , Senator Richard Russell flying off to St. Thomas to advise the governor to defy his orders , NATO Supreme Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Secretary of the Army Brucker contradicting orders sent out by Secretary of Interior McKay . <P> The ostensible snag was merely the selection of a third " neutral " member of the three-man regency council . Faure picked Brigadier General Si Kettani ben Hamou . Kettani declined to accept until he consulted Juin and Brigadier General Jean Lecomte , Koenig 's chief of staff , and an old North African friend of Juin 's . Lecomte told General Kettani to refuse Faure 's appointment . He did .
