( See Cover ) <P> Well-building hath three conditions : <P> Commodity , Firmness and Delight . <P> - Vitruvius <P> Ever since man settled down under roof , he has been at the mercy of his buildings . What he sees , how he lives , looks , thinks-even how he dies-are overwhelmingly affected by the structures he designs and builds . Through the generations , good builders have tried to measure up to the formula of Roman Architect Vitruvius Pollio , contemporary of Julius Caesar , but they have often thought more of the structure than of its inhabitants , and have at times produced more monstrosity than delight , more discomfort than commodity . But in mid-20th century the art of well-building has reached a high state , and is moving toward greater achievements . <P> The greatest progress has come in a land not otherwise noted for its leadership in the world of art : the U.S. From Beacon Hill to Nob Hill , modern architecture has squalled and tottered through its awkward , unruly , early years , but it has begun-if only begun-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new work of younger U.S. architects with all the fervor that Left Bank jazz addicts reserve for Dizzy Gillespie and Satchmo Armstrong . Said a young French architect : " When we have a chance to see what your architects are doing , we have a picture of what the future can become . We have something to believe in . " <P> Monopoly on Masters . In a major sense , U.S. pre-eminence in modern architecture is an expression of the country 's fabulous industrial expansion . It is also a tribute to the triumphant breakthroughs by U.S. industrialists and engineers whose work ( ranging from the pioneering Brooklyn Bridge to the machine precision of General Motors ' new Technical Center outside Detroit ) has made U.S. resources , machine craftsmanship and technical brilliance the envy of the world . Because there have been and are great opportunities in the U.S. , the country now has a virtual monopoly on the best creative architectural talent of this century ( see box ) . <P> Surest sign of the healthy state of U.S. architecture is the large number of promising younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects , none has a better proportioned combination of imagination , versatility and good sense than Eero Saarinen , 45 , son of late great Finnish-born Architect Eliel Saarinen . <P> Outwardly , Eero ( pronounced arrow ) Saarinen ( rhymes with far-'n-then ) looks like a country family doctor , dresses with the casualness of a young college prof , prefers to live clear of the cities , in the rolling countryside of Bloomfield Hills , Mich. ( pop . 2,100 ) , 18 miles from downtown Detroit . His headquarters is a simply constructed , often cluttered office shed he designed for himself , just two minutes ' drive from his home over winding country roads . Even with an office staff of 43 , Saarinen 's is a small operation by comparison with the major U.S. architectural organizations , e.g. , Skidmore , Owings &; Merrill 's 700 employees . Says Saarinen , who likes to see his plans through from drafting table to finished building : " I feel strongly that architecture has to be a personal service . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
