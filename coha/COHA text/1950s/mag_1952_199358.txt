MANY a peer of England is more anciently British than the royal family . The first of the present ruling house was George I ( 1714 ) , a Hanoverian . After Victoria 's death and her son 's accession to the throne , the line became known as Saxe-Coburg ; in World War I King George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg to Windsor . Queen Elizabeth II is the fourth and probably the last Windsor to sit on the throne : three-year-old Prince Charles , the heir-apparent , is a member of the House of Mountbatten , his father 's family , which Anglicized its name from Battenberg . <P> This chart shows the line of succession as it is today . If Prince Charles dies or abdicates without heirs , his little sister Anne will inherit the throne . Next in line after Anne : the new Queen 's sister , Princess Margaret . Thereafter , the succession goes through the late King George VI 's brothers , nieces and nephews : first , to the Duke of Gloucester , and his sons William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Duke of Kent , who died in World War II when his R.A.F. flying boat crashed in Scotland . They are : Edward , now Duke of Kent , Michael ( whose godfather was Franklin D. Roosevelt ) and Alexandra . Last of all in direct succession is George VI 's only sister , the Princess Royal , and her family : George , seventh Earl of Harewood ( rhymes with Gar Wood ) , sometime opera critic for the left-wing New Statesman and married to a Viennese pianist , their year-old son , and his younger brother , the Hon. Gerald Lascelles ( rhymes with tassels ) , who once shocked the court by falling in love with a bonny barmaid , reduced the shock by not marrying her .
