As president of Transamerica Corp. , close cropped , drawling Sam Husbands , 59 , not only runs the world 's biggest bank holding company , but a profitable sideline : insurance . The sidleine was set up by Transamerica 's late great founder , A. P. Giannini , when he discovered how easy it was to sell insurance to people who came to his banks . Last year Transamerica 's three insurance companies earned $5.6 million , nearly as much as the company earned ( $7.9 million ) through its majority-controlled banks . Encouraged , early this year Husbands picked up a fourth insurance company. * <P> But Transamerica , which could insure its customers against death or fire , still owned no casualty insurance company Last week , Husbands bought Philadelphia 's Manufacturers ' Casualty Insurance Co. and its subsidiary , Manufacturers ' Fire Insurance Co. for $6.3 million . With the new companies , which last year took in $11 millions in premiums , Husbands expected Transamerica 's sideline to become more of a main line than ever . <P> * Paramount Fire Insurance Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance Co. , Occidental Life Insurance .
