Invercargill ( pop . 31,613 ) , N.Z. has rocked since January with news of the holes in one shot by Mrs. Frank Small , a 61-year-old grandmother who plays in the upper-90s . When she shot No. 7 fortnight ago ( TIME , April 27 ) , the argument boiled stronger than ever . Skeptics insisted her string of luck was incredible , that there must be some undiscovered explanation . But the greens on Invercargill 's course are not built like funnels ; other golfers have not been duplicating Mrs. Small 's feats . Moreover , there had been witnesses to all seven of her holes in one , usually different sets of witnesses . Mrs. Small , flustered and distressed by the publicity , seemed to want to forget the whole thing . <P> But last week , playing in a friendly foursome , Golfer Small was again reminded of her uncanny accuracy . On a 114-yd. hole , her tee shot arched to the green and dribbled plunk into the cup for her eighth hole in one . Minutes later , on a 190-yd. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopefully : " This doubleheader may have put the cork in the bottle . " <P> One New Zealand editor refused to believe , or print , details of the double head er . Mrs. Small , reported Invercargill 's Southland Daily News , was " so hurt " by such disbelief that " she has sworn that if she has another hole in one she will say nothing about it .
