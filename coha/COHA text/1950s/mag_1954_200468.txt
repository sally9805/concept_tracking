Counting U.S. Senate seats that they expected to win this fall , Democrats underestimated the power of plump , matronly Fern Armitage Johnson , wife ( for 47 years ) of Colorado 's Democratic Senator Edwin Johnson . Big Ed has never lost an election and seemed sure to win again in November . But after 18 years in Washington , Mrs. Johnson felt homesick for Colorado . Last week Big Ed announced : " Mrs. Johnson has developed a complex about living longer in Washington , so retirement is a must . " <P> At 70 , Ed Johnson is still healthy and hardworking . He sounded wistful about quitting the Senate , but Fern Johnson , squeezing his hand , was " just wild with joy . " Republicans were delighted , too . Johnson 's Senate seat , previously a Democratic cinch , is now open to capture . <P> <P> * MacArthur was nominated for President by the Christian Nationalist Party in 1952 without his expressed consent or approval .               @ @ @ @ @ @
