txt The big question in Washington today is , why did Mr. Strauss accept the post ? As former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission , and currently Special Adviser to the President on Atomic Energy , he is considered one of the most influential men in the administration . He has been a powerful and controversial figure . As Secretary of Commerce he will settle into one of the less prominent , less dramatic Cabinet posts . Speculation centers around several possibilities . One is that as Secretary of Commerce Mr. Strauss will be in a position to promote his firmly held conviction that the peaceful development of Atomic energy is a job for private enterprise , not for the government . He has clashed frequently with Congress on this issue . Another possibility is that Mr. Strauss may have a sentimental urge to follow in the footsteps of former President Hoover . of whom he is a devoted admirer and with whom he served in war relief work following World War I. Experience Noted He does not take over the post without experience in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful businessman as a partner in an investment banking firm and as financial adviser to the Rockefeller family . His loyalty to President Eisenhower is well known . If ? the President had difficulty in finding someone who would ? leave his private business for a year period , it is considered more than likely that Mr. Strauss would accede to any plea from the Chief Executive to come to the rescue . Mr. Strauss is recognized as a man of great ability who is per . sonally likable but who has an- .. tagonized many during his ten ' - ' ore as AEC chairman because of what has been called deviousness , and a habit of carrying secrecy to what : many considered an unnecessary and unwise extreme . The resignation of Secretary Weeks leaves only three rnem-. hers of President Eisenhower's. original Cabinet ; Secretary of State . John Foster Dulles ; Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson , and Postmaster General Arthur E. Summerfield .

He became one of the most ardent and persuasive exponents of the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act and worked hard for its extension during the last session of Congress . His initiation into the ways of government and the penalties for quick judgments came suddenly and obviously unexpect. ; edly , when he summarily charged Dr. Allen V. Astin from the Bureau of Standards . Mr. Astin incurred Secretary Week 's displeasure when he refused to approve a certain battery additive . When scientists from all over the country protested this dismissal and supported Mr. Austin in his judgment , Secretary Weeks showed adaptability as an administrator by eating . his words and inviting Mr. Aus- , tin to return to his job .
