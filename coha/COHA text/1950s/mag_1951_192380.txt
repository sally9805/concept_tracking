As founder and for 20 years boss of A.F.L. 's gold-plated Air Line Pilots Association , Chicago 's David L. Behncke did well for his 6,000 union members . Once a crack pilot himself ( United Air Lines ) , Behncke helped block airline salary cuts during the depression , reduced pilots ' flying time from 140 hours a month to 85 , won raises that have brought top pilots ' salaries to $15,000 , lobbied in Washington for better air-safety regulations . <P> In the union paper he edited , Behncke never failed to tell his pilots how much he had done for them . " To be perfectly honest , " Behncke once said , " I never made any mistakes , even in the beginning . " <P> 1,000-Word Telegrams . But some of his union members disagreed . In 1947 they complained of Behncke 's dictatorial methods , tried to unseat him in union elections . Behncke won , largely as a result of a 5-hour speech- " the best , " wrote Editor Behncke , " the Old Man has ever made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an executive board to check him . <P> In negotiations with United Air Lines this year , the pilots got fed up with Behncke 's dragging , nagging way of doing things . They finally bypassed him as bargainer , picked Union Vice President Clarence Sayen , the 32-year-old pilot who shortly before had negotiated a contract with Pan American World Airways . Said one union member : " We 're sick and tired of Behncke 's thousand-word telegrams giving the world 24 hours to get out . " Behncke was furious . He fired Sayen and two other union officials . But the executive board countermanded the orders . <P> Sweatshop ? Behncke was also having trouble with the union 's own employees ; they complained that they were working long hours under sweatshop conditions , and that their wives did n't like it . Hardworking Dave Behncke made a harder answer than any airline boss ever made to a union negotiator . Snapped he : " They can shoot their wives , they can divorce them , but when anyone works for me I want him where I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it he can work for someone else . " The union 's office employees chose another course : they organized a union and appealed to NLRB . <P> Last week A.L.P.A. 's executive board had enough . In a session that broke up at dawn , the union 's directors kicked Behncke out of the presidency , retired him on a pension of $15,000 a year , equal to his salary as president . A.L.P.A. 's new president : Clarence Sayen . Cried ex-President Behncke , who threatened to take the whole matter to court : " Illegal Putsch ! "
