txt ACHESON TESTIFIES SOVIET MOVES SET FOREIGN AID COSTS Secretary of State Withdraws 1951 Estimate of 27 Billion Total Within 3 or 4 Years HOPEFUL OF KOREA TRUCE But Indo-China Situation Is Serious ' ? He Says All 7.9 Billion Asked  --  s Required By FELIX BELAIR Jr . Special to Ma NEW Yowl Thus . WASHINGTON , March 19 ? Secretary of State Dean Acheson told Congress today that the cost and duration of mutual security aid to the United States ' allies would be determined by the size and direction of the Communist threat to the free world . He added that advance calculations of the cost were out of the question . Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the $7,900,000,000 Mutual Security Program , the Secretary withdrew an estimate he made last year that the job of strengthening the free world militarily and economically could be completed in three or four years for about $27 , - 000,000,000 . Questions from committeemen brought from the Secretary a thumb-nail sketch of trouble spots that provided points of friction between the United States and Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the Secretary , but he added that " I am confident the truce negotiations will be successful . " At the same time , he warned against " undue optimism or pessimism in the present difficult phase . " Ridgway 's Patience Praised He said that the highest praise was due to Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway for the patience and competence he had shown during the negotiations . Although the United States is " continually working " to get other United Nations members to supply a larger proportion of troops for the Korean fighting the effort has so far been unavailing , the Secretary related . He described the sivation in Indo-China as " very serious " and said it would remain so until the French could put a large and effective native force in the field . He added that France had committed most of her professionally trained officers and noncommissioned officers to the Indo-China theatre although they were badly needed in France . In addition to this diversion of manpower from the ground forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the Secretary continued , France was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations on which she was spending more than $1,000,000,000 a year . This situation would continue until native Vietnamese forces could be trained , equipped and placed in the field . Voices Confidence in France Secretary Acheson expressed his confidence that France would carry out its NATO military commitments despite the recent Government crisis and that the Western German Republic would do the same . He said all NATO countries were taking steps to counter inflationary forces in their economies , which had resulted in lower defense production due to higher material costs . In the briefest refer'nce to Spain , Mr. Acheston said he was hopeful that negotiations for the use of facilities ? in that country for the NATO defense effort would bring results soon after the arrival , in Madrid of the new United States Ambassador , Lincoln MA.c &gh,; and the accompanying military mission . - While the Secretary was covering the globe with answers to Senators ' questions , W. Averell Harriman , Director for Mutual Security , was defending the Administration 's program before a critical House Foreign Affairs Committee . Both men contradicted published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference on a $300,000,000,000 military budget . Recalling his estimate a year ago that the defense build-up in Western Europe would cost the United States no more than $27 , - 000,000,000 , Mr. Acheson told the Senate group that " experience has shown it is n't as simple as that . " " You can not look ahead and say this job can be done in two years or three years , " the Secretary said . " You have to proceed on an annual basis as We do with our domestic military budget . The most anyone can say with cer // tainty is that it will be necessary to continue for one more year with vt. program of the present magnitude . " Russia 's Role Is Stressed But that did not mean as suggested by Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper , Republican of Iowa , that the American people might be buying " a pig in a poke " because a terminal date for the program could not be set , said Mr. Acheson . Senator H , Alexander Smith , Republican of New Jersey , told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituents the probable duration and ultimate cost of the Mutual Security Program and that he had been telling them it all depended on Russia and whether she would make further attempts at overt aggression . Secretary Acheson nodded approval and said " that 's right , that 's ! right " The witness went on to explain that many of the factors involved in the final cost of program to this country could not be estimated in advance with any degree of accuracy . Much depended , he said , on the availability of materials , the capacity of Western European nations to produce needed weapons and , above all , the intentions of the Soviet Union . Secretary Acheson made the strongest argument to date for the $1,800,000,000 of " defense support " funds requested by the Administration to enable Western European countries to maintain tolerable living conditions while increasing their defense output . He described this item as " the heart and soul " of the NATO rearmament program and said that without it " you simply are not going to get what you are seeking here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression . Would Seek Economy Elsewhere Mr. Acheson told the committeemen he would " look elsewhere " for places to save money if it were decided authorizations had tot be cut . He declined an invitation ' by Senator J. William Fulbright , 1 Democrat of Arkansas , to suggest that the saving be made at the expense of the domestic military establishment . " It would seem to me. " said the Secretary , " that what we should do is try to strengthen the troops in countries that are going to be in the front line of defense and which must meet the shock of any attack first . I would not look first to that avenue to cut . " He dissented vigorously from an observation by Senator Hickenlooper that the United States appeared to have fewer friends around the world now than before it began the multi-billion dollar foreign aid programs . A little later he protested strongly against a proposal by Senator Theodore F. Green , Democrat of Rhode Island , that the authorization contain new language declaring the sympathy of the United States toward peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence . Challenges Green Statement " I would deprecate it , " said ' the witness when asked by Senator Green haw he would react to such ' a statement in the bill . Senator Green argued that many of these colonial and dependent peoples had formed the opinion that the United States had sided against them in their quest of independence and was more sympathetic to the parent countries . Mr. Acheson challenged the accuracy of the Senator 's statement and cut off further discussion by saving : " I think I have said all I can say of a helpful nature . " The Secretary replied in similar fashion to Senator Owen Brewster , Republican of Maine , who concluded an attack on State Department policies in Yugoslavia and the Middle East with a request for Mr. Acheson 's comment . The witness agreed to write the Senator a letter setting forth his reaction but warned that " we in the State Department always try to approach these problems in an effort to reach a solution rather than to create new ones . " Connally Supports Acheson The Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his scrape with the Maine Republican . Senator Brewster noted that the amount of the recent $300,000,000 grant to Britain for economic aid was identical with the revenue loss to that country last year resulting from the Iranian oil shut-down . Senator Brewster sought to make the point that if the State Department had made a greater effort to reach a solution of the oil controversy along lines satisfactory to the Iran Government , the United States would not have been required to grant Britain the $300,000,000 . Secretary Acheson reminded the Senator that Britain 's $300,000,000 loss on Iranian oil was only one of many adverse developments in its economy that added up to a $1,500 , - 000,000 loss of gold and dollar reserves last year and said that the two figures were not really connected . The witness was pursuing this line of explanation when Senator Connally broke into the exchange to say the Iranian oil controversy had nothing whatever to do with the measure before the committee and that Senator Brewster should discontinue his " political fishing expedition .
