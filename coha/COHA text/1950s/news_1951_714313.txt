txt If the television and radio part of Chicago 's great electrical goods business had to be rebuilt , you might choose four individuals . One would be a colorful personality who once worked as a $6 a week automobile mechanic , the second a fast talker who persuaded a landlord to provide a factory for a $565 company with no rent in advance , the third a man who started a $3,400 enterprise in the corner of a borrowed garage , and the fourth a person formerly known as W9INZE . This would be about as good a reconstruction formula as could left and Galsin be devised , because these individuals actually started four of the city 's most important companies . They are , in order , Eugene F. of Zenith Radio corporation , Paul V. Galvin of Motorola , Inc. , Ross D. Siragusa of Admiral corporation , and onetime radio ham William T. Halligan of the Hallicrafters company . They represent a major part , but by no means all , of the Chicago area 's huge electrical manufacturing industry , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electric goods here covers thousands of different products rangSiragusa left and Halligan ing from industrial trucks capable of lifting 100,000 pounds to hearing aids ; from telephone switchboards with thousands of miles of wiring to the simplest fixtures ; from ranges to thermostats , and from power tools to radar and other fabulous electronic devices . The industry , embracing hundreds of plants , is difficult to define. , ' out the Chicago Association of Commerce estimates that it employs more than 100,000 men and women and produced 13 billion to 2 billion dollars ' worth of goods last year . It is an intricate , quick changsometimes uncertain business which depends on practical scientific progress and , especially in the consufner product fields , on an aptitude for promotion and competition . This city 's leadership in making things- which are operated by electricity can be traced back well into the last century . Chicago had the nation 's biggest enterprise of this kind in 1880 . Men like Gen. Anson Stager , Edward N. Hurley , George A. Hughes , Enos Barton , Elisha Gray , and Milo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television aerials began to decorate its roofs , The most recent addition to the list of Chicago personalities in the electric goods field is James J. Nance of Hotpoint , Inc. , a newcomer who in a few years has built a medium size business into one of the three largest manufacturers of appliances . Backgrounds Are Varied Many companies in electrical manuacturing have colorful backgrounds . The main reason seems to be that the industry , in the past as well as the present , has attracted a number of spectacular operators . of Zenith is a prime example . This company 's history goes back to the early days of radio in 1920 when , a World War I naval intelligence officer , met two young men who were making a radio receiver and also operating a ham station with the call letters 9ZN . The " ZN " became " Zenith " when he formed a partnership . The Zenith head was well equipped financially for the radio business , having been successful i n the automobile sales and financing fields before the war . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , and had worked his way up to a sales manager . In-1910 , when cars were sold for cash , he set up an auto finance company and built up a lucrative trade . Company Big During ' 20a Zenith was one of the big radio companies of the 1920s , with sales of about 10 million dollars in 1929 . Since then has taken it thru two difficult changes which left other companies on the rocks . The more recent of these switches was to television . The earlier was the depression change to lower price radios the average price of a set in 1939 was $34 , against $136 a decade earlier ) . Some of Zenith 's property near Dickens and Austin ays. is a reminder of a company which did n't make it . The property originally was owned by the huge Grigsby-Grunow company which had the " wonder stock " of the late 1920s and which went into receivership in 1933. has won additional repute as a yachtsman and explorer and , most recently , as the leader of a drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoter of phonevision . Own Hearing Impaired He invaded the hearing a i d field in 1943 with a low priced device and has been warring with high price sellers . His own hearing was impaired in an early automobile accident . His phonevision idea of providing a box office for telecasts has gained prestige since theater circuits began outbidding advertising sponsors for some of the top boxing shows . Motorola 's Galvin , unlike his competitor , was not well financed when Ile went into business in 1928 . He and his brother , the Late Joseph Galvin , managed to scrape up only $565 to invest in the Galvin Manufacturing corporation to produce battery eliminators for home radios .. He talked his way into factory space and got several. , customers to help furnish manufacturing equipment . Then the battery eliminater market collapsed and he looked around for a new product . He found it in a novel radio set for automobiles . To get orders , he and a few associates drove to a radio manufacturers ' convention in Atlantic City , where they displayed the set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sold Car to Raise Cash Orders were taken C. 0 . D. and Galvin was in business again . He also took orders from a Washington junk dealer and a ca , driver in Chicago . Both sold Motorola auto radios on the side , later becoming distributors . Admiral 's Siragusa and three associates did a little better on financing . The associates were John B. Huarisa , Richard F. Dooley , and Kenneth D. Turner , who also became company executives . The original capital of $3,400 was invested in 1934 , not an easy year to get money , and Siragusa sold his car and most of his home furnishings to raise his share . Known in its early days as Continental Radio and Television corporation , the company started in a corner of a borrowed garage . Siragusa was convinced that there was a good mass market for low priced radios . Most of the starting money was used for soldering irons and other equipment , so he tried , u.rsuccessfully , to get operating funds , at one time offering a half interest for $100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retail at $9.95 , was rebuffed by chain stores and mail order houses , and finally sold 250 sets to a Pittsburgh jewelry chain under an arrangement which involved payment for the sets before his supplier bills were due . Siragusa took a similar low price look at TV . Admiral this corporate title was adopted in 1943 from a brand name bought for $100 in 1936 turned out about 500 bulky receivers and then found a gap in selling prices which Siragusa said was " big enough to drive a truck thru . " The company leaped into the small , low price field . Halligan of Hallicrafters became interested in wireless at the age of 14 in Boston , practicing code on homemade transmitters until operators at the nearby navy yard complained . After high school be worked as a wireless man and in World War I he was on a mine layer off the coast of Scotland , rising to chief radio operator . Provided Pearl Harbor Link He moved to Chicago because he thought this city would be the electronics center . He was a manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out to make sets to ham standards in 1933 . Hallicrafters equipment was in service on every front in World War H. One set provided the only contact from Pearl Harbor for several hours after regular communications facilities were damaged . Hundreds of radio and television parts operations supply the big assembly plants of these and other Chicago producers . The parts business , which made an enormous contribution to the nation 's military strength in World War II , ts proud of the fact that it preceded the assembly industry . Jerry Kahn , head of Standard Transformer corporation , one of the oldest and Ilargest Chicago parts companies , recalls when most of the components were made for people who built their own radio rigs . To get back into really old times in Chicago electrical manufacturing , the records to examine are those of the city 's largest establishment in this field , the Hawthorne works of Western Electric company . Started as Small Shop Western Electric now is a vast nation-wide concern , quietly performing laboratory and manufacturing wonders as the Bell telephone system 's supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 162 S. Water st . The shop was known as Gray &; Barton . It actually had three partners . They were Elisha Gray , a college professor and Inventor : Enos Barton , a telegrafer , and Gen. Stager , who was a Civil war telegraf expert and a vice president of the Western Union Telegraph company , Gray and Barton bought the shop with a $500 note indorsed by Stager . They made and repaired telegraf instruments , electric annunciators , and burglary and fire alarms . Survived Chicago Fire In 1871 the Chicago fire missed Gray &; Barton by about two blocks and the firm supervised repair of electrical installations and helped restore telegraf facilities . A year later the business became the Western Electric Manufacturing company with Stager as the first president . In 1880 it was the largest electrical manufacturer in the country , . competing in telephone production with companies operating under the Alexander Graham Bell patent . Gray had invented a phone about the same time as Bell . In 1881 the Bell company absorbed Western Electric as its supply unit , dropping " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first application of telegraf in the Civil war , was president until 1885 , He was succeeded by William S. Smoot of the Remington Arms company , a revolver inventor who was the son of Capt . Joseph Smoot , hero of the U. S. S. Hornet in the War of 1812 . Enos Barton came next and he personally selected the Cicero prairie site for the Hawthorne plant . Makes Central Dial Systems Telephones no longer are made at Hawthorne . The main job now is the manufacture of giant central office switching systems that work quickly and efficiently for anyone dialing a telephone number . The Kellogg name also is important in switchboards , altho the Kellogg Switchboard and Supply company now produces many other telephone products . Milo G. Kellogg , whose grandson , James H. , is president , in the late 1890s made the largest manual switchboard ever put together up to that time . His factory was an old school building in Highland Park . Milo Kellogg , who had been working with telephone devices for about 20- years , got this big order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telephone company in 1896 to provide that city with service . Orders poured in from independent phone companies after this installation and in 17 years the company built and installed 9,000 switchboards . Made Grabsphone In 1905 Among the " firsts " claimed by this company was the manufacture of the first cradle type phone on a commercial production basis in 1905 . It was called the Grebephone . While the phone makers were expanding in the 1900s , a North Dakota inventor came to Chicago with an idea for a " wire cooker . " He was George A. Hughes , whose father had started a small electric generating company in Bismarck , He put an electrician to work in 1909 converting an oil cook stove in a shop on S. Dearborn st . The result was the fins/ electric range . Hotpoint , which developed from the Hughes business , now can turn out 600,000 electric ranges a year in just one of its Chicago area plants . Utility Men Skeptical Hughes demonstrated the first range at a convention in St. Louis . Utility men were skeptical about its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power company in Butte . He organized the Hughes Electric Heating company , began turning out ranges in commercial quantity , and several years later moved to 5600 Taylor st. , location of the present Hotpoint headquarters . Hughes Electric merged in 1918 with the Hotpoint company , a California flatiron manufacturer , and the heating division of Gen , eral Electric company , which was moved to Chicago . Hotpoint dis ; continued manufacture of hand irons 20 years ago but still gets requests . Hughes , who headed the business for 34 years , died in 1944 . The company had changed its name several times . A few years ago it appropriated the brand name , Hotpoint. for its corporate title and also got a new president , James Nance . Under Name , the company has expanded from two to seven plants in the Chicago area . Besides producing the most ranges , dishwashers , and water heaters , it now makes seveta ' other appliances and turns out jet engines for the government . First Electric Washer in 1907 Just before Hughes invented the electric range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the late Edward N. Hurley , who founded the company now known as the Thor corporation . A completely electric ' washing machine was developed in 1907 by Hurley , a former locomotive engineer who had started a small factory for floor scrapers . The washer , built in the Hurley Machine company factory in a loft at Jefferson and Quincy sts. , was a large , ungainly machine . It was a cylinder t ype washer with all mechanism , gears , and chain drives exposed . Despite its appearance , it worked well and one was used for years in the home of Thomas A. Edison . Hurley immediately had trouble with prices and public confusion . Hand operated machines then were selling for about $12 . Hurley tagged his electric at $85 and had to hike this price to $125 when expenses exceeded income . The public asked such questions as " do you have to use soap and water ? " Fine for Sorting Apples When he got an order for 12 machines from Pomeroy , Wash. , Hurley went west to invest igate . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orchards Farms to sort apples . A Pomeroy genius h a d modified the washer to grade fruit with a series of canvas pockets attached to the chain drive of the wringer . To earn expenses of the trip , Hurley called on west coast utilities , returning with enough orders to lift output to 18 a day and give the business a good start . Today , Thor is headed by Hurley 's sons , Raymond J. and John R. Some companies go thru unusual changes in their climb to prominence in the business . One of these is Sunbeam corporation , big Chicago producer of mixers , shavers , toasters , and other small appliances . Sunbeam was established in 1893 and originally was called Chicago Flexible Shaft company . Its products included mechanical animal clippers , such as sheep shearing machines , and manufacture of irons was begun in 1910 to offset the seasonal nature of its business . Smaller Firms Colorful An electrical goods producer does n't have to be a giant to have a colorful company background . Russell Electric company , founded by S. I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric blank-1 ets in 1912 for sale to sanitariums for patients sleeping outside as part of their treatment . War work gave Northern Electric something new to do , each time . In World War I the com pany made electric glue pots which were used in repairing the canvas covered aircraft . In World War II it produced electrically heated flying equipment .
