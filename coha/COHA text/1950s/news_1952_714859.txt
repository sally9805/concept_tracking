txt DEMOCRATS ADVISE TV FOCUS BE KEPT ON STEVENSON ONLY Party Strategists Would Put Truman in Background for Knock ' Em Down ' Talks DEBATE ILEA IS REJECTED High-Plane ' Fight Is Mapped for Governor With Stress on East and Midwest By WILLIAM S. WHITE Special to Ms NEW Yout Tams . WASHINGTON , Aug. 18 ? Some of the leading Democratic campaign strategists are backing a policy that would keep President Truman relatively in the back ; ground on television and turn the full focus on the Presidential candidate , Gov . Adlai E , Stevenson of Illinois . They have proposed or will propose both to the White House and to Stevenson headquarters in Springfield , Ill. , that all efforts be made to leave the television medium exclusively to Governor Stevenson as " a man visiting the living rooms of the country . " They are suggesting that President Truman give all his attention to the more intimate type of speech ? " the hit ' em and knock ' em down type of speech , " to be made only in selected areas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday in Springfield , they are convinced that Governor Stevenson has no intention of heeding the appeals of some Democratic partisans that he seek to force Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Republican nominee , to " mix it " on radio and television . Governor Stevenson has left them with the strong impression that he has no relish for such an idea- because . it was said here authoritatively today , he wants to avoid any impression of trying to intrude on the greater present celebrity of his Republican opponent . Governor Stevenson realizes that General Eisenhower is more widely known and he has no intention of seeking to " horn in " on the basis of the general 's popularity . The Democratic Strategy The probable shape of the Democratic campaign , though by no means fixed and firm as yet , may be described as of now as follows : 9Goverrior Stevenson probably will make what politicians call " a high-plane " fight , with particular attention to the East and to the Midwest , and in the Midwest is expected to give special aid to Democratic Senatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 41 , President Truman , it is believed by qualified informants , will avoid anything that could approach casting a shadow over the nominee . 6The other two of the so-called Democratic " Big Four " ? Senator John J. Sparkman of Alabama , the Vice Presidential candidate , and Alben W. Barkley , the retiring Vice President  --  will be used as highly mobile speakers , possibly dispatched here and there to trouble areas with little advance notice . qUnusual Democratic attention will be paid to the South , although the non-Southern partisans now believe it to be fairly safely back in the party . The intention here will be to try firmly to nail down the 128 electoral votes  --  it takes // 26E ; to win the Presidency  --  of the South that so much was done at the Democratic National Convention to try to make safe . For this purpose , Democratic leaders are marshaling a formidable group of Southern speakers , headed by two of the major Presidential aspirants at Chicago ? Senators Richard B. Russell of Georgia and Estes Kefauver of Tennessee . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably Vice President Barkley las well . Apart from al this , the day brought these political maneuvers here : 9 Senator Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois , chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and a member of General Eisenhower 's board of strategy , struck back at a ministerial critic , the Rev. Richard Paul Graebel of Springfield . 41 a sermon yesterday , in the First Presbyterian Church in Springfield , the Rev. Mr. Graebel accused Senator Dirksen of " telling a blatant lie " to the effect that Governor Stevenson was " the worst Governor " Illinois had seen since the turn of the century . Replying in a formal statement , Senator Dirksen charged Governor Stevenson with a series of " scandals " in his Administration and , with " trying to smear General Eisenhower by associating him with Senator Joseph McCarthy , thus clearly demonstrating that he places the convicted traitor Alger Hiss on a par with the Wisconsin Senator who almost single-handed forced the State Department to fire known ConununiZts and perverts . " Again attacking Governor Stevenson for having given a character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in denying Communist espionage , Senator Dirksen , who himself is a Presbyterian , continued : " I think that while the Reverend knows Governor Stevenson well , it might add something to the discussion to remember that the former Mrs. Adlai Stevenson has said that she will not vote for him and his own family newspaper , which endorsed him for Governor , has so far been unable to endorse him for re-election or for President . " Now , that the Springfield minister has taken up the defense of his most prominent parishioner , I expect his sermons to deal less with me and more with the history of Illinois ' state government under Adlai Stevenson . " Let him explain , not to Senator Dirksen but to his miner , farmer and other church members . " As for me , I try to , practice the Christian virtue of charity but at the same time I know that from the national standpoint we must follow the Gospel admonition to ' seek the truth and the truth will make us free . ' The facts will speak more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Republican of New York , asserted that figures from the Internal Revenue Bureau showed that admitted gamblers in twenty-six northern counties in Illinois had paid in $98,892 in Federal taxes in July . This , Mr. Reed declared , refuted Governor Stevenson 's claim to having cleaned up Illinois . The returns indicated , he asserted , that the " very few " gamblers willing to report their profits had , taken in $1,988,920 in June , or about $24 , - 000,000 a year . It was " a conservative assumption , " he said , that only one gambler in four would file a return and therefore that Northern Illinois gamblers altogether took in a possible $100,000,000 a year , apart from what other gamblers made in other parts of the state . 9 Senator James E. Murray , Democrat of Montana , called General ' Eisenhower " Tom Dewey 's candidate , " on what he said was the word of Senator Dirksen , who had supported Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio over the general at the Republican National Convention . Senator Murray called on President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told the President that " Westerners in particular and farmers in general will go more solidly Democratic than they did in 1948 -- but only if the campaign gets rolling quickly and we get the facts and the issues out . " The Senator asserted that in the Eisenhower candidacy " us farmers and Westerners " would fear " control of our agricultural and reclamation policies by those same Eastern interests which always have and always will want to exploit the West and gouge the farmers in the interests of their own pocketbooks.
