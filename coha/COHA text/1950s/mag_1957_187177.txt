" What pipes and timbrels ? What wild ecstasy ? " So the U.S. might well ask ( with Keats ) at the alarming sound that was heard in the land last week . The same sort of sound had rent the air as General Washington was being pushed out of Brooklyn , as Napoleon went down at Waterloo , as the British in Kenya marched off against the Mau Mau . For Scotsmen in the U.S. , normally outshouted and out-paraded by the Irish , it was a great and noisy occasion : on hand for a 57-city U.S. and Canadian tour were the pipes and drums , regimental band and Highland dancers of Scotland 's own Black Watch , under the command of Major Claud MacBeth Moir . <P> High-Kneed Unison . The Black Watch opened in Washington ( where it stirred its audiences to exuberant Dixie rebel yells ) , moved into jampacked Madison Square Garden , last week skirled through Canada and New York State before heading for points west . Even for a non-Scots observer , the Watch has swank . First off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army and wearing the somber kilts that gave the Watch its name when it mustered for its first parade on the banks of the River Tay in 1740. * <P> While they march and wheel , their cymbals whirling , their diced hose and white spats blurring in high-kneed unison , they play such lilting Scots tunes as Thistle Green and Wee MacGregor . On their heels , majestically slow , come 28 pipers and twelve drummers in a stunning rendition of standard Black Watch ceremonials . The Crimean Reveille starts with a single , furiously impatient bugle call that gives way to the pipes and drums skirling and moaning through The Soldier 's Return and other wild pipe tunes-The Green Hills of Tyrol , King George V 's Army , The Highland Laddie . <P> Solo Lights Out . Then the dancers come out , lay their swords and scabbards in a cross on the floor and perform the Gillie Callum , or individual sword dance ( which is said to date from 1054 ) . Their arms held aloft like antlers , their thumbs and forefingers held delicately together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crescendo of movement that usually sets the crowd to whooping , yelling and stomping . Toward the end , a solo piper-spotlighted on a platform as though he were walking a battlement-softly plays Lights Out , and with a final scream of pipes and whang of drums the Watch marches out . <P> The regimental routine has been jazzed up a little , Major MacBeth Moir admitted , for the benefit of the public : " Possibly some old regimental officers might turn in their graves , but I hope not . I think they would be proud . " <P> <P> *The Watch was originally thrown together as a force of Highland police to prevent cattle stealing , soon became a regiment . Unkilted and wearing khaki battle dress instead , the Watch fought in World War II in Greece , Tobruk , Alamein , Burma , Sicily , Italy , Normandy , Germany .
