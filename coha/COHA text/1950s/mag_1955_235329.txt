No sooner had President Eisenhower moved into his Gettysburg farm last week , than enterprising photographers , training long lenses from perches as far away as one-eighth of a mile , got pictures that seemed to put the viewer right into Ike 's backyard . Next day Presidential Press Secretary James C. Hagerty asked photographers to stop it . " It is vitally important to the welfare and to the health of the President , " said Hagerty. " that he be allowed to walk around that farm without having or being conscious of telescopic lenses on him at all times . " <P> <P> Hagerty spoke to the White House press corps from a new address : a Gettysburg basketball court that had been trans formed into headquarters for the 48 newsmen covering Ike 's sojourn . One end of the white and rose room-which still looked like a gym-was the assembly area for Hagerty 's twice-daily briefings . <P> Townsfolk wandered in and out , especially after the evening movie let out next door , peered over reporters ' shoulders . Moppets surprised the newsmen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regularly to cover the Hagerty briefings for the campus paper and to talk shop with press corps veterans . <P> But the press corps was getting the news out as smoothly as from Denver or the White House press room . Only one thing made newsmen a bit uneasy : they were still dependent for their news on virtually only one source : Press Secretary Hagerty.
