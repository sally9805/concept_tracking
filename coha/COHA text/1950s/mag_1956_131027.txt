Two hours before the 27th running of the Flamingo Stakes at Hialeah last Saturday , Needles was dozing peacefully in his stall . While he was being saddled , he still looked half asleep . But once Jockey Dave Erb was aboard , the good-looking bay colt came alive with a seizure of kicks and bucks to demonstrate that he knew the time for action had arrived and he was ready for it . // Minutes later he had made a near-shambles of this year 's first rich ( $148,800 ) test for 3-year-olds , earning $111,600 for his owners and establishing himself as the early favorite for the 1956 Kentucky Derby . He did it in characteristic fashion , much the same way as his sire , Ponder , won his races . Next to last out of the gate and 11th after half a mile , he responded to Jockey Erb 's urging with one mighty closing run that cleared the track in front of him . // Needles ' impressive victory hardly comes as a surprise . For one thing he won six of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year by the experts on the staff of the Morning Telegraph and Daily Racing Form ( SI , Dec. 5 ) . For another assist in the victory you can credit those Florida lawmakers who , some years ago , in a move to stimulate interest in Thoroughbred breeding in Florida , proclaimed that on occasions such as the Flamingo all home-breds would receive a five-pound weight allowance . Thus , while all 14 of his opponents were burdened down with 122 pounds last Saturday , Needles , conceived in Kentucky but foaled in Florida , skipped around the mile-and-an-eighth Flamingo distance toting only 117 pounds . From now on , unless the present Florida legislative body wants to stir up a war among honest horsemen who come to Florida each year wanting only the chance to win a few hundred thousand dollars without interference from the State House , it should forget the old law in a hurry . If stimulation for Florida breeders is that important , then why not more races limited only to Florida-bred horses , as California does ? // There will be , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to argue that Needles would not have won had he been required to carry 122 pounds . And just as ready to argue the point back with them will be his trainer , Hugh Fontaine , who , as he stood beaming in the winner 's circle , said , " Sure , I was glad to have that five pounds , but , hell , the way he was running today , it would have made no difference . Actually the extra five pounds might have made him level out better and win by more than 2 ? lengths . " // EARLY TRIALS IMPORTANT // Hardly debatable , however , is the significance of early 3-year-old trials like the Flamingo . Only last week , Jimmy Jones , who , along with his father , Ben , has carved out a fabulously successful career as trainer for Calumet Farms , put it this way : // " The transition period between the ages of 2 and 3 is probably the most important period in the career of a race horse . From the one season to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to , and only when he turns 3 can you get a pretty fair idea of whether he 'll be any good or not . " // Jimmy Jones , of course , was reflecting the point of view of the professional horseman , but what he said was just the sort of sought-for encouragement that owners of new 3-year-olds were waiting to hear . For , despite the glamour of winning big stakes and bushels of money with a 2-year-old , owners of race horses know just as well as the people who come out to bet on their horses that  --  with very few exceptions  --  real racing glory comes only through ownership of a champion 3-year-old , a colt who carries his colors to victory in , say , the Kentucky Derby , the Preakness or the Belmont . // Most owners too are fortunately just as aware as the Jones boys that what happened in 1955 wo n't necessarily happen in 1956 ; that there is no written law which states an ugly horse can not outrun a handsome one or that a fashionably bred colt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-but-forgotten stallion . This , then , is the time of the racing year for owners to hope . // " If , " as one owner said , " a man ca n't look at his horses in training in February and feel thrilled at the thought that at last this is going to be his greatest season , then that man has n't acquired the basic ideals of race-horse ownership . " // TOUGH SEASON AHEAD // The season for 3-year-olds is a long and grueling one , and of the roughly 7,500 colts , geldings and fillies who advanced a year in age last January first , only those animals with the utmost soundness , durability and heart will be around to take the bows next fall . Many a " name " in February will have turned into a vague memory or a complete nonentity by November . But the luring challenge in the months between is the opportunity to race for over half a dozen stakes worth $100,000 or more each , against the toughest opposition the sport can provide . // Hialeah 's Flamingo will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it does , for the present , provide a basis from which to start appraising the 1956 crop . Two and a half months ago , when he listed 118 3-year-olds in his Experimental Free Handicap weights , New York and California Handicapper Jimmy Kilroe went on record as saying he could see nothing outstanding about the caliber of the horses he felt obligated to weight . " This does n't mean , " Kilroe hastened to add more recently , " that it wo n't be a good year . On the contrary , I think it 's often the case where a crop of ordinary  --  or evenly rated horses  --  will provide for a more interesting and exciting season than if you come up with one , or even two , horses who dominate the scene so completely that people are inclined to forget that there are other horses even running . " // There are , for that matter , many fine colts running at the moment , and a few did themselves no discredit at all in losing to Needles . His runner-up was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even to be found on the Experimental list ( Kilroe 's Experimental ratings are based on his personal judgment of how the previous season 's 2-year-olds would do in a theoretical race at a mile and a sixteenth in the fall of their 2-year-old year . It is recognized not only as an appraisal of form by an expert based on 2-year-old performances , but also as a forecast of what may be expected from these same horses when they turn 3 . ) Actually the race known as the Experimental is run in New York in the spring , and in recent years the horses top-weighted by Kilroe have usually preferred to skip trying its six-furlong distance under handicap conditions in order to concentrate their preparations for the longer distances which will be required of them in the 3-year-old classics . // Behind Golf Ace were a lot of fair prospects about whom more will be heard . There were , for instance , Mrs. Elizabeth Arden Graham 's Gun Shot , a chestnut son of Hyperion ; Mrs. J. R. H. Thouron 's Happy New Year , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nail , who , if he has n't decreased in stature by finishing ninth , certainly indicated no ability for going a distance of ground . Also in the Flamingo field were two Calumet colts , Fabius and Liberty Sun ( who finished third and seventh respectively ) . " All I 've been hearing down here at Hialeah , " said cagey Jimmy Jones the day before the Flamingo , " is that Calumet is loaded . I do n't know who started that one , but it just ai n't so . We 've got four or five colts that I 'd call just nice prospects  --  Liberty Sun , Fabius , Eastgate may be the best  --  but it 's too early to tell . Horses have to be brought along slowly to go a distance and you 'll often discover that when you 're about to give up on one , he 'll surprise you by developing almost overnight . Ponder was that way . Three weeks before he won the 1949 Kentucky Derby none of us really believed he was a mile-and-a-quarter horse . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a case of Ponder showing us he could go a distance , but he took his own sweet time in showing us . Horses wo n't be hurried in their training . If they 've got it , they 'll show it to you when they 're ready . If they have n't got it , all the training in the world wo n't make ' em do what nature does n't intend for them to do . This is the kind of year when there could be any number of horses develop overnight  --  surprise all of us . I just hope we got one of ' em . " // Not to detract from Needles ' victory , it 's still true that the colt most of the trainers at Hialeah were thinking of last week was a sleek , black number who was n't even on the grounds . His name : Career Boy . Career Boy had been top-weighted on the Experimental list at 126 pounds ( one pound more than Needles and Nail ) , and although he failed to finish at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handicapper Kilroe voted him a special award : the colt most likely to succeed in 1956 . Owned by C. V. Whitney , Career Boy is at the moment training at Camden , S.C . Last week he was just galloping , this week he starts breezing , and what Trainer Syl Veitch has seen to date makes him all smiles . " He showed us last fall that he can run at the finish , " says Veitch , " and from his breeding he should have no trouble going a distance . A son of the Belmont Stakes winner Phalanx , Career Boy is out of a Mahmoud mare , Swanky , who is a full sister to the 1946 Futurity winner First Flight . He 's a slow starter and usually takes five-eighths of a mile before he 'll level out . But then , whammo , away he goes . " One of Career Boy 's stablemates at Camden is a son of Eight Thirty named Head Man , whose dam is another Mahmoud mare , Snowfall . " He is developing better than ever , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious of all the compliments being heaped on his two best 3-year-olds . " If they 're all saying I 've got the best horses , they 're just trying to put me on the spot . But I do n't mind it so much . I 'm just watching and waiting  --  watching to see what the Florida and California charts tell me  --  and waiting to see the others beat their brains out . I hope we 'll be ready for them when the time comes . " // There are other names that will bear watching this spring , and still others who may make themselves heard by later in the summer . And there are some who made news last year who will find the pickings thin in this new season . Remember Prince John , winner of the Garden State ? He was injured in Florida and wo n't be seen until at least midsummer . And Swoon 's Son ? They say he 'll be a sprinter only  --  and sprinters do n't win Kentucky Derbies . But for future reference here are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a big way : Busher Fantasy , Getthere Jack , Liberty Sun , Eastgate , Gun Shot , Happy New Year , Lawless , Terrang , Fabius , Call Me Lucky , Count Chic , Greek Spy and Born Mighty . To many turf fans , these may hardly be familiar names , but some of the owners they represent surely are : Mrs. Elizabeth Arden Graham , Mrs. Isabel Dodge Sloan , Rex Ellsworth , Mrs. Gene Markey , Mrs. Anson Bigelow . And this is the kind of season which will almost certainly see many new faces in winners ' circles around the country . // It 's a long way from the Flamingo to the Derby  --  only two horses , Lawrin and Citation , have made it from one winner 's circle to the other . In between now and the Saturday afternoon of May 5 will be many a severe test . Just to name a few : the Florida Derby , the Chesapeake , the Wood Memorial , the Blue Grass Stakes and the Derby Trial . // Another test comes off this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect from such West Coast 3-year-olds as Terrang , Like Magic , Fathers Risk , Blen Host and Polly 's Jet . Californians are almost ready to admit that they do n't have a Kentucky Derby horse this season . Of course they admit this with tongue in cheek . They know perfectly well that three of the last four Kentucky Derby winners  --  Hill Gail , Determine and Swaps  --  all won the Santa Anita Derby first . It could happen again in 1956.
