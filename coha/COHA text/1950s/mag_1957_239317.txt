Prokofiev &; Tolstoy The U.S. witnessed a major musical event this week : the American premiere of the late Sergei Prokofiev 's War and Peace . Although the composer finished his first version while the Germans were still rumbling toward Stalingrad , the sprawling work , which in one version took eight hours , had been performed only once before outside Russia ( in Florence , in 1953 ) . The present 2hour edition-brilliantly produced in an English translation by NBC-TV 's enterprising Opera Theater , and conducted by Peter Herman Adler-was. the version Prokofiev himself approved before his death four years ago . It turned out to be less an opera than a pageant , but it offered some of the best music Prokofiev ever wrote . <P> The libretto , by Prokofiev and his wife , Poetess Mira Mendelsohn , arbitrarily hacked great chunks out of the Tolstoy epic without ever linking them in true dramatic tension . Tolstoy 's own brilliant literary counterpoint-in which he switched from peace to war scenes and back-was abandoned . All the peace was concentrated in the first part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the figures in Part I suddenly dropped out of sight . Moreover , the libretto was narrative rather than dramatic , required whole passages of flat prose to be set to music , with the result that long stretches of the score were labored and discursive . In the war scenes , the opera stiffened with self-conscious patriotism , which Prokofiev illustrated with military airs that occasionally verged on the banal . But overall , War and Peace was a notable achievement . Whatever it lacked in sustained dramatic effect it made up in color , movement , and the driving force of lyric melody and great choral frescoes . <P> The music of the first part and the situations that it animated glowed with an almost Latin fervor . Andrey and Natasha ( well sung by Morley Meredith and Helena Scott ) faced each other across a garden ashiver with moonlight and poured out their yearnings in great warm gusts of melody ; Natasha pirouetted giddily at a ball and lacily sang her infatuation with Anatol across the shimmer and sheen of violins . In one magnificent ball scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dance , dance , dance the waltz " ) eerily foreshadowed the dance of death that was to come on the battlefields . In other passages the music sparkled with a dry wit , or lilted through the great candlelit palaces . <P> As Prokofiev moved from personal emotion to glorification of the Russian masses , he was less successful , but nevertheless produced some fine choruses-e.g. , the troops in praise of General Kutuzov , the citizens in a hymn of thanks for victory . The second part also produced the most authoritative acting-and one of the finest voices-in Baritone Kenneth Smith , who played General Kutuzov with sinewy dignity . High point of the opera came in one of the closing scenes , in which Andrey and Natasha were reunited as Andrey lay on his deathbed . Through his delirium he hears a pulsing beat , played in the orchestra by the strings sul ponticello ( bow strokes near the bridge ) , and echoes it over and over again in a faint , falling cry . In one of Prokofiev 's most dramatic musical inventions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest ever written for opera .
