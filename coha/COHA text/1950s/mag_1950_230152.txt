Marxist dialectics reached interesting heights of confusion last week in the election of a deputy mayor of Colombo ( pop . 355,000 ) , capital of the island nation of Ceylon . <P> Colombo 's city council , which elects the mayor and deputy mayor , has four major parties : United Nationalists ( conservative ) , Communists , and two brands of Trotskyites . For deputy mayor , the Communists had to choose between a Trotskyite and an independent with Nationalist support . <P> They plumped for the Trotskyite and their three votes elected him . <P> This decision was a grave ideological error . Within hours , they were denounced by Ceylon 's Communist central committee and suspended from the party . <P> The three erring Communists knew just what to do . They immediately issued a standard confession , admitting their error and endorsing their own censure . This reversal reminded the Ceylon Daily News of another Marxian " crisis " wherein Groucho , feeling the pulse of an unconscious woman , looks up at his audience and says , " Either this woman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
