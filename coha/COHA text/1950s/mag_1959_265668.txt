Since the spring of 1957 , law-enforcement agencies have been trying to unravel the complex dealings of Fancy Financier Lowell McAfee Birrell , 52 , who promoted his way to control of 40 companies , mainly through top posts at Swan-Finch Oil Corp . and Doeskin Products , Inc . Last week a New York County grand jury indicted Birrell on 69 counts of grand larceny , alleged that he stole stock worth $14 million from the two companies . <P> Birrell , a Presbyterian minister 's son and a lawyer , began his jiggery-pokery after he got control of Swan-Finch in 1954 . He increased the oil company 's shares and exchanged them for the assets of other firms . The indictment charges that one of his biggest coups , the exchange of 700,000 shares of Doeskin Products stock in 1957 for 1,140,390 shares of Keta Gas &; Oil Co. , a Swan-Finch subsidiary , was accomplished " by presenting a fraudulent document .

He pledged the rest of the Doeskin shares as collateral for loans . When the loans fell due , the moneylenders sold the stock to satisfy their claims . Through such tactics , Birrell personally is alleged to have made $3,000,000 at the expense of the stockholders . <P> Stocky ( 5 ft. 8 in. , 200 Ibs. ) , well-tailored Birrell has not been seen in the U.S. since November 1957 , when he failed to answer a warrant for his arrest in a Securities and Exchange Commission case involving Swan-Finch . Since then he reportedly has been in Havana and other foreign capitals leading a fast and elegant existence , always with a beautiful girl on his arm . <P> Birrell 's New York lawyer has said he will advise Birrell to come home and fight the case . But convicting him will be no easy task because of the intricacy of his maneuvers . Said John Devaney , chief of the New York SEC 's fraud division : " Birrell 's strategy is well-nigh infallible .
