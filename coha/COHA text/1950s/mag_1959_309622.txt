Princeton students once voted him the world 's worst poet , and a jeering couplet hounded him for years : " I 'd rather flunk my Wassermann test/Than read a poem by Edgar Guest . " * Such insults missed their mark , for Edgar Albert Guest never even pretended to be a poet . Said he : " I am a newspaperman who writes verse . " And at the time he died last week at 77 , Edgar Guest 's success as a verse-writing newspaperman had never before been equaled and may never be again . <P> Genial , gentle Eddie Guest was born in England , came to Detroit with his parents in the 1890s , dropped out of high school before graduation , and washed glasses in a drugstore . He landed an office boy 's job with the Detroit Free Press , worked his way onto the news staff and became a first-rate police reporter . But life 's seamy side was not for Edgar Guest ; he asked for a change of assignment and was moved to the exchange desk-where a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . By 1916 he was rhyming his own column seven days a week , and he kept it up for 43 years . <P> By ordinary literary standards , Guest 's verse was mundane doggerel , written in soporific singsong and filled with synthetic back-country colloquialism . Guest 's world abounded with wimmen folks , doctor folks , farmer folks and jes ' plain folks . He extolled friendship and friends , God and worship , his wife Nellie , his son Bud , his daughter Janet , the virtues of porch sitting , of babies , tablecloths , wood-burning stoves and wooden tubs , sausage , and two kinds of pie ( lemon and raisin ) . To Edgar Guest , death was " God 's great slumber grove " or " the golden afterwhile . " Samples of his rhyming : <P> Ai n't it good when life seems dreary <P> And your hopes about to end , <P> Just to feel the handclasp cheery <P> Of a fine old loyal friend ? <P> Ai n't no use as I can see <P> In sittin ' underneath a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , <P> An ' that your life is extry sad . . . <P> Such verses carried Eddie Guest to fame and wealth . With the Free Press as his home base , Guest at one time saw his verses syndicated in 275 newspapers . He filled 25 books , and some 3,000,000 people bought them , as before they had bought Ella Wheeler Wilcox and James Whitcomb Riley . A Heap o ' Livin ' ( " It takes a heap o ' livin ' in a house t ' make it home/A heap o ' sun an ' shadder , an ' ye sometimes have to roam " ) alone went through 35 printings , sold more than 1,000,000 copies . At his peak , Guest earned $128,000 a year . He had many impressive friends ; Henry Ford and William Lyon Phelps were among his greatest admirers . He owned two handsome homes-a vast , colonnaded winter residence in Detroit , a summer home in fashionable Pointe aux Barques . <P> Guest 's success confounded him almost as much as it did his critics . As well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same kind of jingles that James Whitcomb Riley used to write , " said Guest . " All he tried to be was sincere . " All Eddie Guest was was sincere ; reading his verses on TV , he used to weep with the emotions they aroused in him . And perhaps it was because millions of readers recognized sincerity and shared in those emotions that Edgar A. Guest , the newspaperman who wrote verse , was a U.S. phenomenon .
