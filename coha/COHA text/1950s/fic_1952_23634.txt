The Queens of the Flowers A Short Story by Glen Haley Drawings by Arthur Shitstone 1 T was Papa 's idea for us to go over on the Western Slope after the Fletcher Shows went busted in Salida , Colorado . He knew a fellow , Roy Martin , with a fruit ranch near McCord , and Papa said Roy would give us all jobs , even Mama and me and the two boys . Of course I 'm thirteen and old enough for quite a lot of work , but Cecil is only nine . Harold is eleven , a bad age . We expected to just stay until we got some repairs on the Model A and bought some clothes , but then Papa hired on as a mechanic at the coal mine above McCord and seen the chance to make a real stake  --  maybe buy an interest in a Ferris wheel , he said , instead of just greasing one . But we had to have a place to live that winter , and that 's how we went to see old Mrs. Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Everybody said she was either going to die or move to California , one , and she wanted someone to take the place and look after it . I sometimes wonder how things would have turned out for us if we had n't gone to see Mrs. Wallace that day . It 's a cinch if we , any of us , had known what was going to happen afterward we would have sure steered clear of the place . And still who knows ? Maybe it was better the way it worked out . Maybe what happened would have happened anyway . They sent me in to see her . I 'm a good hand with old people . It was a pretty nice big old wooden house with a scraggly front porch . There was some kind of flowers , or what wasleft of them  --  this was late September  --  planted all over the front yard . Mrs. Wallace was n't in the house  --  she was out in back , sitting on an apple box turned over on its side , digging away at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them just planted everywhere back there . She was sitting there with her legs spread apart under her dress as only a real old lady would sit , and when she finally took me in through her glasses she spoke real pleasant . " Hello , little girl , " she says , " you 'll have to excuse me , I 'm trying to get my beds into shape . It 's quite a task for an old body like me . " I said it did look like quite a job . I asked her what kind of flowers they were . " Peonies , child . The most beautiful peonies in the world have been grown right here in McCord . Mr. Wallace my father took peonies to the St. Louis World 's Fait , you know , and won the blue ribbon . " Old people , the lonely ones , they do n't care what you come to see them for , they just glom right on to you and start talking , and the best thing is to listen for a while . She talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how badly the flowers was run down and how she wished she could get a man in to help her out . I broke in then and told her why I was there . She was a little doubtful about Harold and Cecil . But I lied and said that they was well behaved , and she staggered out front on my arm , and talked to Mama and Papa . The boys was quiet thank heavens at the time , and she finally decided that we could " try each other out " for a week . The last thing she said was to Papa : " Are you a flower lover , Mr. Casey ? " Mama could n't help snickering , but Papa just sat there , looking dumb . Finally he said : " I never been accused of it before . " " If we 're going to get along well , Mr. Casey , " Mrs. Wallace said with a smile , but meaning it , " you 're just going to have to help me with my peonies , that 's all there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Papa said . After we drove off , Mama said , " Well , Casey ( she always called Papa Casey  --  his given name is Paul ) well , Casey , that 's going to be good , you following that old lady around , diggin ' in that old yard like a big prairie dog . " Papa swung the car around the corner so hard that it like to piled us kids all in one heap , and said , " We got to live somewhere . " p APA certainly worked hard that fall . He left for the mine before daylight , and when he come trudging up the street around four o'clock  --  he rode with some other fellows  --  there would be old Mrs. Wallace , out on the front porch , tyin ' on her bonnet as he come through the gate . She sure run him ragged . She had a bad habit of clicking her false teeth and then smiling kind of silly and making a joke out of everything she wanted done . Papa cleared off weeds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke up the clumps of flowers and threw some away and planted others in different places . Finally he had to rent a trailer and haul in three tons of sheep manure . He said he sure felt like a fool when he told the Greeks west of town he wanted that manure just to put on some flowers . One afternoon they was working out back and I was getting supper  --  Mama had n't got back from town yet  --  and I heard Papa growl : " These here flowers must be quite the stuff to be worth all this trouble . " Mrs. Wallace just said in an awed way , " Oh , Mr. Casey  --  have n't you ever seen peonies ? " " Not to my knowledge . " Well , there was n't any more work for a while . Mrs. Wallace lowered herself down on the back porch and put her hands out almost as if she was praying . " They 're the queens , " Are you a flower lover , Mr. Casey ? " Mr. Casey . The real queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that my father developed himself . The Wallace St. Louis Red and the Wallace Bronze  --  they 'll take your breath away when you see them in bloom , they really will  --  bronze with yellow centers  --  red with pink centers  --  the loveliest things on the surface of the earth . " Papa never said anything for a minute , and then he just shook his head . That night when he come in to say good night and have a cigarette , he said , " You still pray once in while , do n't you , Sister ? " I said I did . He pulled in a deep drag there in the dark and sighed , " Well pray for a change in the weather , will you ? That old lady 's got me dragging my tracks out . " I would never pray for a thing like that , but the weather changed anyway . Late cold rain , and a first snow , and that was the end for Mrs. Wallace . She had a bad spell of colds , was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to California . The man who run the bank come by in his car to take her to the train . He had a real old but kind of classy car , and on Sunday afternoons he rode around reared way back behind the wheel , while his wife rode in the back seat . Papa helped Mrs. Wallace into the back seat with the banker 's wife and she said good  --  by to us real nice , as if we was family . At last she said to Papa : " Thank you very much , Mr. Casey , for helping me with the queens ; they 'll repay you for it a thousandfold in the years to come . " Mama looked up at the trees to keep a smile from running wild , and Papa he looked down at the ground and hooked his thumbs in his back pockets . " That 's all right , " he said . And the big old car moved off . " ' They 'll repay you for it a thousandfold , ' " Mama mimicked as we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? there ai n't gon na be no ' years to come ' for me in this hick town . " B UT I think even Mama sort of enjoyed that first winter in McCord , even when the snow come to stay , and the roads was bad , and it was so cold . We had a house , and each one of us kids had a room upstairs of his very own . The boys did n't do too well in school , and I had trouble in English , but I did good in arithmetic , because I used to help Mama make change when she run the baseball concession with the Fletcher Shows . I made friends with several kids that went to the same Sunday school that I did . Papa was an Odd Fellow and we took to going to the Odd Fellow dances . Mama really loved to dance . Around eleven-thirty , if the grownups was n't ready to leave , I would round up the boys and come on home . But Mama was restless , even that first winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear her quick , high laugh coming from the Silver Grill when I would go by after school  --  but I knew better than m stop in and bother her unless it was something real urgent . And she used to try to get Papa to go down after , supper for a few beers , and sometimes he did , but lie usually begged off by saying he was too tired . Mama would go anyway and nights when she got borne real late there would be a big hullabaloo with Papa over it . And yet they had the really big fight after the PTA carnival , of all things . I had told the teacher about Mama and she was asked to take the baseball booth . She used to run one with the shows and she sure did a job of it for the PTA . About everybody come around to watch at some time or other that evening . I was sure proud of her . And then afterward they took us kids home and went down to the restaurant . About one o'clock that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it downstairs . After the big fireworks was past , the crying and the shouting , I went downstairs and through the hall to the kitchen for a glass of water . They was sitting on the sofa  --  or Papa was  --  Mama was up and down . Right now she was having a cigarette and walking up and down in front of Papa . I suppose I remember Mama best with a frown on her face , as she was then . But Mama was pretty . Her hair was long and just a little red even when it was n't tinted , and she wore it with nothing but a black band . She always looked so young . " Do n't you feel it once in a while ? " Mama was saying . " Do n't you ever feel like loading the kids into the car and just pickin ' up and sailin ' right on out of here ? " Papa was sitting there , plucking at his lip as he did when he was troubled . Mama said , " Come on . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and head for the , / Coast . Pick up a show at Ocean Park , and make the big circle . What do you say ? " She I could hear her quick high laugh . set down beside him and leaned over and looked up into his face . " The kids is happy here , " Papa said . " Kids is happy anywhere , " Mama said ; " they have big times with the carnival . " " There 's more than big times . This is the first real schoolin ' they 've had , almost . And besides , we 've got this house at a real low rent ? " " Damn this house , and everything around it , " Mama shouted , stood up . " You 're gettin ' to be a regular old woman yourself , from livin ' in this house after one  --  tendin ' flowers ... . " " Them flowers do n't mean a damn to me , " Papa shouted . " Well , you sure spent enough time putterin ' with ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Marie , we ca n't take the kids out of school . We 'll have to stick around until June . " On the stairs I stopped and waited to see what Mama would answer . It took her a long time . Finally she said , in a low voice , " I 'm stayin ' a while , Casey , but not too long . " W INTERS go slow in McCord , but spring when it finally comes , comes fast . All at once . It seems to show up in the sky first and then to seep down through the hills making them bald of snow . Then you see it in the sods of the ditchbanks and the dry streaks in the roads . Finally the orchards get it , in buds and tiny leaves , and before you know it , the peach trees and then the apples , pink blooms and then white , all spring into glory row on row around the hills . And Papa , when the ground begun to thaw , started puttering around out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said about Old Lady Wallace the fall before . I kind of kidded him about it one night when he had been digging up one of the beds . He was sitting on the back stoop smoking and I come out and said : " How 's your queens comin ' along , Papa ? " He looked around at me with a ridge between his eyebrows . " What are you talkin ' about ? " I felt kind of silly myself after I said it , but I told him then , " Well , Mrs. Wallace always called them her queens and since you 're lookin ' after them , ai n't they your queens ? " " Oh well , hell , " Papa said , " they 're just a bunch of old flowers , not even that yet , but as long as I was put to so darn much trouble last fall , and as long as we 're livin ' here , might as well get a little of the good out of ' em . " The more he talked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " I got to keep the goddam yard cleaned up , no use lettin ' the weeds take over . " Mama sure got his goat one night . It was the night he found the first bud . He called us kids back to look at it as if it was really something , and about that time Mama came up the driveway . She was just back from town , and she was feeling , well , pretty good . For the first time she showed some interest in the flowers . She bent down and studied the bud , and said " Why it sure is . It sure is a peony bud . " " Yeah , " Papa said , looking over her shoulder , " I just come out this evening , and there it was . " " Well , well , " Mama said . " I figured all this old stuff that looked so dead would have to go , but now I see that some of it is coming back good , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still looking at the bud , called to the boys who had gone back to playing marbles . " Harold and Cecil , reckon you could use a good marble ? " and before Papa could stop her she flipped the bud right off the stem with her thumb and finger and over at the boys . Both she and Papa stood up , and she give a kind of a dirty little chuckle , but I did n't like the expression in Papa 's eyes as he stood there gripping the hoe handle . " Oh Casey , " Mama laughed , " you should just see the expression on your face . " He still did n't say a word , and she said , " It 's just a joke ; you ai n't lost your sense of humor , have you , livin ' in this one-horse town ? " But the flowers come on , and they did look fine . There was some big old red ones in the corner by the fence that just took your breath away . And if Mama did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several stopped to look at them , one or two a day sometimes . The banker stopped one Sunday , and said Old Mrs. Wallace would be proud . He said Papa ought to take some to the County Fair . " That would be really good , " Mama said afterward ; " I can just see you goin ' to the fair with your hair slicked back and carryin ' a fistful of peonies  --  brotherl " Peach harvest come on again , and we were still in McCord , with Mama gettin ' a little unhappier about it every day . She just could n't get any definite answer , about when we would leave , out of Papa . Or out of us kids either . We were kind of used to the place by now . It seemed like home . The boys talked about roaming again but I do n't really think they wanted to . W HEN harvest was over , we went down to the fair . We seen the rodeo in the afternoon , it was n't much , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Cedaredge , who had an exhibit of peonies , and they were really something . Papa just stood and stared . This Mrs. Wooton was there herself at the time , and she come out and said , " Do you like them ? " " They 're sure all right . " I could n't help saying , " Papa raises ' em too . We live in McCord . " Well , she just lit all up and took his hand and shook it right then . " You 're the man at the old Wallace place ! " she said . " I 've heard you 've been working with them . " " Oh , I just kind of keep the weeds down , " Papa said , " but yours  --  they 're just an all around better class of peony than them we aot " 0 . " Oh , you 're wrong , " she said , " give them time . You may have to replace some of the stock , and use some commercial fertilizers , but in another year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mama could n't stand any more of this , she tapped Papa on the shoulder and said , " Me and the kids are takin ' a walk down the midway  --  I got to get out of here before I vomit . " So we went on . It was getting along toward dark , but We were n't in any hurry to leave when we got to the midway . It was fun to watch the suckers and see what they were going for . It was just like old times , and it made your heart heat faster , to smell the old smells and see the lights and hear the noise . Almost as if we had never been away . Mama 's face really brightened up , and she was chewing away at her gum at a great rate . It was n't long before we got to a baseball game . There was a fellow there , he was darkcomplected with long black sideburns , and he wore a cap . Kind of good looking . He held out three baseballs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little girl . " " What do you think we are  --  suckers ? " Harold yelled , and Mama laughed and said , " Listen , buster , I was peddling throws when you was in knee pants . " And I said , " I would n't have one of them kewpie dolls . I bet they did n't cost you two bits apiece . " " Well you 're a bunch of hard cookies , " he said . " Carnival people ? " " We was , " Mama said , " but we got shang-haied . " Cecil was hungry , so Mama told all us kids to go get some hamburgers , and she stayed and talked to the fellow . After we got the hamburgers , I spent an hour and a half throwin ' the rings at another concession . I give the fellow a pretty hard time , and the crowd got quite a kick out of it . I can really toss those rings . Course the prizes is hardly worth keeping . We stayed that night because Mama wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then we waited at the door for Mama . She danced about half a dozen times , I guess , with the fellow with the black sideburns . And then Mama and this fellow disappeared . Papa was really mad . We kept lookin ' for ' em and lookin ' for ' em on the dance floor , but we could n't see ' em . Finally the band played " Home , Sweet Home . " Papa said , " You kids go pile in the car . I 'll be back . " We did n't argue with him . We went , The boys was asleep on their feet , anyway . It must have been an hour and a half before Papa got back . All the cars had left and we was parked all alone on the lot . The moon was up , real big and pale in a sky that was shimmery , like blue spun candy . I saw Papa , finally , comin ' from the direction of the carnival . He fell down twice . I finally got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands was all wet . " Is the boys asleep ? " he said . I told him they was , and he struck a match . His hands was all cut and bloody , and there was a long bloody slash across his chest , right through his shirt and underwear . " Had some trouble , " he said . " Reckon you can hold the car on the road ? " He leaned back in the seat and never said anything . I think he was kind of out of his head . Once he almost cried , saying , " Oh , Marie  --  Marie  --  Marie , " and another time he muttered , " I worked him over good until he went for his knife . " He would n't have a doctor . I helped him clean up before he went to bed . That was when he asked , " I guess you know what your mother is focin ' to do , do n't you ? " I just could n't answer : my lips trembled too much . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't , Papa , " I said , " please do n't . " After a minute he said , " That 's right , honey . She 's still your mother , no matter what . Always think as well as you can of her . " p APA did n't go to work or any place . He just stayed upstairs , smoking . When I got home from school that night I was hoping against hope that Mama would be back . But the downstairs was vacant . Papa was still in his room , but he 'd been out . There was a jug of wine'on a chair . I woke him up around dark and asked him if he wanted something to eat . All he said was , " Did she come back ? " " No , Papa , " I said , " not yet . " He did n't get up all evening . I heard him in the middle of the night , moving around , but he was in bed again next morning , and stayed again all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the carnival had moved on . Papa came into my room late that night . He was dressed , and had his hat and coat on . He called to me in a low voice so as not to wake the boys . " Sister , " he said , " I want to talk to you . " He was n't drinking this time , but when he worked his way down to a seat on the side of the bed , I could feel his body tremble a little . He lit a cigarette . " Sister , I feel if I stay around here , I 'll go out of my mind . I got to hit the trail . " I felt like crying . But I just said , " Well , Papa , we 'll just pack up and light out , then . " " No , " he said , " you kids is better off here . And I got to be alone . " His voice sounded really troubled . " It 's hard to explain , Sister , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I always been crazy about your mother ? " " Oh , Mama 'll be back , " I said . " I look for it . " It was fun to watch the suckers and see what they were going for . " I do n't . I know it wo n't be her and me again . Now I just want to be on my own for a while . I 've got to have it that way . " " What 'll happen to us ? " " I 'll be sendin ' you money , right along . " I could n't ask it right away but finally I controlled myself well enough to get it out . " You 're comin ' back , ai n't you ? " " Oh sure , " he said , " Oh sure I will . " He said it too quick . I knew he never intended to . And what he said next proved it . " I 'm no good to you . " " Oh Papa you are . We need you twice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I ai n't no good . You kids would be better off where you had someone to look . after you . " " I can look after the boys -- I always have . But I need you to look after me , and to sort of lean on when the boys are too much for me . I ? " Papa squeezed my hand . " You 're my brave little girl . " Then he kind of brightened , or pretended he did . ' ' You know , I 'm an Odd Fellow with good standing , and they have one of the nicest homes for children , over in Canon City , that you ever saw ? " " That 's the same town the prison 's in , " I said . " Oh , but it 's a nice place , " he said quickly , " it do n't have nothin ' to do with the prison ? " " We wo n't go , " I wailed , " Papa , we wo n't go . I 'll take the boys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All right , all right , " he said , patting my hand . " Do n't wake the boys . We 'll see , sister , we 'll see . For the time bein ' you kids stay on here and start to school . And you look after the other children till you hear from me . Will you do that ? " " Of course I T told him . " There ai n't anything else I can do . " . " All right now , " lie said . " Give us a kiss . " Before he went out I called out to him . " Do n't forget us , Papa . " I think he was about to cry , too . " Of course I wo n't , " he said . " I 'll be thinkin ' of you a lot . And you 'll hear from me often . Good-by , Sister , " was the last thing I heard . I guess I cried just about all night . In the morning I fixed a little breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa come in to see me late last night , " I told them . " He 's gone on a little business trip . " Cecil did n't say nothing , but Harold said , " He ai n't gone on no business trip . He 's just lit out . " He 's the most disconcerting youngster , at times . He started crying , which of course started Cecil off , but I talked and talked , and finally they come around . I told them of course that Papa would be back sure , in a little while , and that he would be writing to us right along . I had a hard time with the boys as the weeks went by . When they did n't feel like doing a thing , why , of course they did n't do it . But , some days they was better about it than other days . My worst trouble was getting them home at night . Papa sent a little money along and we got by . And it was December before the neighbors , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town council we was living at the Wallace place all alone . They turned it over to the lodge and a fellow come to see us . He started right away harping on the Children 's Home , but I told him that Papa would be back in a month , and that he would be awful put out if they did a thing like that . They did n't exactly believe me , but they did decide to hold off awhile , and they hired a woman , Mrs. Kittredge , to come in and look after us . She helped with taking care of the clothes , and she baked pretty good bread except now and then you found a long gray hair in your slice . But she could no more control the boys than she could fly , and they was always hurting her feelings and then she would call me in . So I was just about looking after all three of them . Still , it was the best we could do ; I realized it was her or the Home , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and then there . You heard from him in Cody , Wyoming , in Salt Lake City , and in Phoenix . He did n't write much . I felt awful low and lonely once in a while that winter . For a long time , I used to always get a little thrill out of seeing a tall , slouching man on the street , because I thought it might be Papa , and even as much as I was mad at Mama , I used to always go by the restaurant when I was coming home from town , and hold my breath , almost expecting to hear Mama 's quick , loud laugh coming from inside . But I begun to get over it as the winter wore out . And along toward spring , too , I could tell it was n't going to be long before the lodge THE QUEENS OF would take steps . The superintendent at school had come up to visit us , and shook his head about it . I knew it was coming . ND then , one evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys to come home from wherever they had got to . It was a springlike evening in March , and I was for some strange reason thinking about the peonies , Papa 's queens , and how they would look this year , when a tall slOuching man walked by on the street , as though his feet hurt . There was something in the sound of the footsteps that thrilled me , even though I could n't see him well . I held my breath . He stood there outside the gate a few minutes , and then he opened it and come in . " Hello , " Papa said . " Is that you , Sister ? " I think I was happier to see him than the boys was , at least at first , because when they showed up around ten o'clock , he tanned them both good and sent them to bed . I ca n't say I felt exactly sorry for them , either ; Harold especially had got awful impudent and independent while Papa was away . Papa was quiet and kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his job at the mine . And although the snows clung to the ground yet , he often sat on the back porch in the growing dark before supper and had his smoke . One time I come out and at beside him . And that 's when he said all he ever did say about being gone . " Pretty hard on you kids , was n't it , while I was away ? " " Yes it was , Papa , " I said . " I thought you was n't ever coming back . " He picked up a piece of stick and rasped the rotten bark off with his thumbs . " I did n't know either , Sister , " he said , " where I would go or what I would do . I did things I 'm ashamed to think about just to keep going , going on without thinking , until one morning I was laying in a hotel bed in an Arizona town , feeling low . And you know , all of a sudden I do n't know how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , and I could see it as if it was sort of under water , everything was standing so still and straight . It seemed to me all the peonies was in bloom , looking bigger and finer than ever  --  especially them big reds over in the corner there . " - Papa threw away the stick . " Then I asked myself  --  what are you running away from , Paul Casey ? Why do n't you go back to your home and your kids ? And I hit the trail that afternoon and come right straight here . " " I 'm glad , Papa , " I said . And as Papa sat there , looking out over the back yard , I could n't help thinking that maybe lie had come back to McCord because of us kids , it was pleasant to think that ; and anyway he was home that was the important thing , but just the same I was sure glad that the queens was there with us , to help us pull him home .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
