The boys at Madison Square Garden waited to be shown , for sophomore basketball flashes too often became fumbling schoolboys on their first trip to Manhattan 's big time . When he loped out on the Garden 's floor last week , the University of Cincinnati 's Oscar ( " Big O " ) Robertson needed a big night to show the skeptics he could play in the big league . <P> Robertson showed them the biggest night , pro or amateur , in the history of Garden basketball . Floating through the defense of Seton Hall , the lithe , 6-ft. 4-in . Negro from Indianapolis did everything right . He drove for layups , hooked from the foul line , jump-shot with either hand . He picked off rebounds , intercepted passes , set up teammates . When the Big O was done , Cincinnati had drubbed Seton Hall , 118-54 , and the new boy in town had 56 points , a Garden record . <P> Long before game 's end , the specialists in the press box were wondering whether Robertson did not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Salle 's Tom Gola , De Paul 's George Mikan or even Kansas ' Wilt Chamberlain . Robertson 's points lifted his game average to 32.1 , second in the nation only to Chamberlain 's 32.2 , led Coach George Smith to muse : " You know , this is the first time we ever let this guy loose . " On the loose again two nights later as his team smashed North Texas State , 127-57 , Robertson scored 35 points , squeaked past Chamberlain with a game average of 32.3 . The New Yorkers were convinced . Said St. John 's Coach Joe Lapchick : " This is the greatest sophomore I 've seen . "
