One day last week , Clement Attlee quietly picked up the morning paper . A minute later he found himself in the most embarrassing how-de-do a British Prime Minister had faced in a long time-the kind of situation that a Socialist would hardly wish even on his worst capitalist enemy . <P> It was the eve of the Paris conference on the Schuman Plan ( see above ) , and the paper reported on a pamphlet entitled European Unity , put out by the Labor Party 's National Executive Committee . The day the pamphlet reached the public , Attlee was slated to explain to the House of Commons that despite Britain 's aloof attitude , the British government really wanted to cooperate in the Schuman Plan - at least in considering it . Yet the sweeping , truculent pamphlet seemed to proclaim to all the world that the British Labor Party wanted to do nothing more than blow the Schuman Plan to smithereens . <P> Surprise . The brown-covered , 15-page booklet ( price : 3d. ) violently rejected not only the Schuman Plan but the whole idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only way Western Europe could be saved , said the Labor Party 's little book , was through Socialist planning and public ownership of industry . Britain must not surrender any of its sovereignty to a supranational body , since such a body would be dominated by non-Socialists who would interfere with Britain 's domestic planning . The pamphlet also came out flatly against a Council of Europe with any real legislative power . <P> In the works long before Schuman made his dramatic proposal , the pamphlet had originally been intended to clarify the policy of the Labor Party , which had been divided on the issue of Western European federation . By the time the drafting committee got through with it , the small group favoring federation had been silenced . The finished document bore the arrogant , doctrinaire mark of its chief author , Minister of Town &; Country Planning Hugh Dalton , whose bumbling indiscretions had gotten him and his government into trouble before . <P> Attlee had seen an early draft of the pamphlet , made some marginal notes on it , then forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printers last month without Attlee 's knowledge ; Labor Party headquarters forgot to tell him the publication date . <P> Silence . The pamphlet hit the world like a slap in the face . Cried ECA 's Paul Hoffman : " Deplorable isolationism ! . . . " France 's Robert Schuman said with Gallic politeness : " I am surprised . " It was , he added , " a brutal decision . " <P> Attlee tried valiantly to repair some of the damage . First , he effectively silenced Dalton , who had been trumpeting his views at press conferences . At week 's end , under Dalton 's chairmanship , Socialist delegates from nine countries assembled in London to consider the <P> Schuman Plan ( the French Socialists , who support the plan , were so annoyed with their British comrades that they sent only one delegate ) . Dalton was unusually quiet . The conference broke up a day early , issued a polite communique which carefully skirted the real issues .                @ @ @ @ @
