Capital Airlines ' President J. H. ( " Slim " ) Carmichael flew into London to make a deal that revved up the British aircraft industry 's sorely tried pride . Last week he ordered 15 more Vickers Viscount turboprop airliners ( for $18 million ) , giving him a total order of 75 , of which he has already received 29 , all now in service on Capital 's routes . Said Carmichael : " There has never been an airplane that has operated with greater dependability than the Viscount . The public likes Viscounts and we like them . " <P> Capital bought the Viscounts in 1954 because it had to have planes that could match the big , swift DC-6s and DC-7s of its rivals on the crowded New York-Washington-Chicago routes . Yet because it has few long , nonstop hauls , Capital could not operate big planes as economically as other lines . The medium-range Viscount seemed to be the answer , although , as the first foreign-made plane to fly in U.S. airlines , there was a question how it would stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Viscounts were a hit from the start . With big picture windows , less noise and vibration than piston-engined planes , the Viscounts operated up to 85% of full load for the first few months , have averaged 70% in their first full year v. an average 64% load factor for the rest of the industry . Replacing Lockheed Constellations with Viscounts on the Chicago-Washington run , Capital tripled its business , carried 33,802 passengers from February through May 1956 v. 11,322 passengers during the same period of 1955 . Traffic on the New York-Pittsburgh run was up 74% ; Chicago-Pittsburgh was up 90% ; Chicago-Cleveland was up 124% . <P> Figuring all costs , says President Carmichael , Capital 's Viscounts had a break-even load factor of 56.8% , almost 10% better than its piston-engined Constellations . Total operating costs are $1.57 per mile v. $2.16 for the Connies . But the initial costs of getting the new Viscounts into service actually cost Capital a $1,300,000 deficit in 1956 's first quarter , will probably hold down profits this year , even though operating revenues were up to $11.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
