RUSSIA Purge of the Purger ( See Cover ) <P> Down Sadovaya Boulevard , a wide , busy thoroughfare in north Moscow , sped a detachment of Soviet tanks and truckloads of soldiers . The time was 5 p.m. , the day June 27 . Such sights are rare in Moscow , and foreign diplomats noted the movement with interest . <P> At the Bolshoi Theater in Sverdlov Square that evening , the great red and gold curtain rang up on a new opera called The Decembrists , a propaganda piece about a rising of military officers in 1825 , at the outset of Czar Nicholas I 's reign . The Soviet Union 's finest vocalists were on the stage , but opera was not the evening 's sensation . Glancing towards the great state box , which dominates the glittering dress circle of the Bolshoi , the audience saw that it was impressively occupied . Sitting there , impassive , iron-mouthed , unsmiling , were the supreme leaders of the Soviet Union , some in the dark cloth of civilian office , others brilliantly bemedaled . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of their rare public demonstrations of solidarity since the death of Stalin . Counting the heads , the audience found one missing ; the cruel , slyly epicene face of Lavrenty Beria , first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers , chief of the Ministry of Internal Affairs ( police ) , boss of atomic energy , was not among those in the state box . Next morning , Moscow newspapers reported the visit of the great to the Bolshoi and carefully listed the twelve leaders present . The name of Beria was not mentioned ; there was no explanation of his conspicuous absence . <P> Foreign ambassadors , including the U.S. 's Charles Bohlen ( who had been denied .. admittance to the performance ) , passed the news on to their governments ; foreign correspondents filed briefly . Rumors about Beria ran round Moscow , but there were no hard facts . Some recalled that Beria lives with his family in the posh Sadovaya district , in the direction the tanks headed-but so do many other Soviet leaders . U.S. Ambassador Bohlen asked Washington for vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Majorca . <P> Behind the Scenes . Unknown to the foreigners at the time , and to all but a few Russians , a plenary session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party was held ten days later , somewhere in Moscow . On this committee sit Russia 's 200 mightiest Communists , men with great rank and great fears . They gathered to hear the most significant news since Stalin 's death 93 days before : the struggle for power among the Kremlin 's titans had begun . <P> It was suety Georgy Malenkov , the Premier , who got to his feet before them , to put the finger on Comrade Beria . This trusted man , said Malenkov , had committed " criminal anti-party and anti-state actions , intended to undermine the Soviet State in the interest of foreign capital . " How had his criminality been manifested ? In " perfidious attempts to place the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Internal Affairs above the government and the Communist Party . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
