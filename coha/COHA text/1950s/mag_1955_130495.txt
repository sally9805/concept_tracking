The impressive American victory at Wimbledon has left a lot of people feeling that right now Uncle Sam is safely up on top in the tennis world . It 's easy to overlook the fact that most of the glory won on foreign battlefields is due to the efforts of one man  --  Tony Trabert . The unpleasant and disquieting truth is that one man does n't make a tennis team ; that we need a tennis team for our next big hurdle , the Davis Cup matches at Forest Hills in August ; and that we are in real trouble on that score . // For a Challenge Round there must be another singles player plus a doubles team . Who will be our other singles player and who will play the doubles ? We may hope that Vic Seixas gets over his ailments and that Ham Richardson will pull out of his slump , but our bench is still lacking in able reserves for these spots . Never has our need for good players been greater , and seldom in recent years has the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that one man might be available  --  that American in Paris , Budge Patty . This 32-year-old tennis war horse with a yen for continental living shot into the tennis spotlight with a brilliant showing , highlighted by his straight-set victory over Australia 's strong young ace , Lew Hoad . Patty might have been just the ingredient our Davis Cup team needed  --  a stylist with an effortless , poised game , an excellent repertoire of shots and plenty of savvy picked up in years of playing the European circuit . // But Patty turned me down when I tried to persuade him to come to Forest Hills and make the team . He likes the life in Europe . He has made many friends there . He has n't wanted to break these ties by coming to America for the Eastern grass court swing which winds up with the national tournament at Forest Hills . // Then there 's Dick Savitt , the big bear from Orange , N.J. , now at Houston , Texas , whose great ability was demonstrated once again when he gave both Trabert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River Oaks Invitation in Houston ( SI , May 2 ) . Savitt was top news in tennis four years ago  --  an overpowering player who defeated Australia 's best , Frank Sedgman and Ken McGregor , on two successive days and , with the Aussie championship under his belt , went on to win at Wimbledon . But then Dick virtually retired . He went to work in the oil business , played weekend tennis regularly but seldom showed up in the big time . // Yet , as I said last May , if he chose to make a comeback he could certainly make the team . He could make our big three of today uneasy , and might even become the head man of a new big four . I wish he would . // THE SPIRIT OF THE LITTLE NATIONS // Perhaps what we need is more of the spirit that animates all the little nations of the Davis Cup who year after year come out and keep this worldwide competition a living , animated and exciting thing . Each time the Davis Cup play starts rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartened  --  to see players of countries like Norway , where skiing is the major sport , or the Philippines , where tennis is still in its infancy , take up their rackets and try once more . They know they have n't got a chance but they keep on plugging . // The last 11 Challenge Rounds have been the monopoly of the United States and Australia with the U.S. winning six and Australia five of the matches . Of all the other countries in the world , only France , Belgium , Japan and Britain have enjoyed the prestige of a Challenge Round performance . // Yet 24 countries were entered in the European zone eliminations , which began several months ago in scattered cities of the old world . There are seven in the American zone waiting to begin July 15 . There were three originally in the Eastern zone , with Burma already eliminated by the Philippines who in turn went down to Japan . // This repeated failure to crack the United States- Australia tennis orbit certainly must discourage the other nations at times . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of engaging in a fine sport  --  inevitably brings them all back . // It 's different when you 're always in the top ranks knowing you will stay there . Perhaps a winning player gets jaded , surfeited with victory . But here is something for Americans to think about , a new note which is creeping into the annual Davis Cup play : // I recall at the Davis Cup dinner following the Inter-Zone matches , Gunnar Calin , the diminutive captain of the Swedes , said he did n't know how long Europe could keep challenging . The expense of sending a team all around the world was great . The returns were always slim . And Calin added a remark which has , perhaps , the significance of that well-known cloud no bigger than a man 's hand . He said he had heard some talk in European circles of a possible European competition . The countries participating would bolt the Davis Cup and play among themselves . // Such an eventuality would seem no threat to so traditional and honored an affair as the Davis Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among European nations , Calin said , is being fed by the Russians . Bent as they are on winning prestige in the sports world , they would like to enter international competition but fear to do so while the U.S. and Australia remain so far ahead of the world . // Russia has sent delegates to many European tournaments to talk of a new tennis alliance , a strictly European affair with America and Australia barred . So far , it has been only talk ; I do n't think any country would lightly bolt the Davis Cup . But I can readily see how , with a push and a promise , they could get the urge . // It 's up to us  --  the U.S. and Australia  --  to keep the Davis Cup the living tradition it has been . It 's up to Americans to provide the players . The door is wide open . Get your rackets out , men , and walk in !
