Leaving the appalling mess of the Korean truce talks and the prisoner-of-war issue behind him , Matthew Bunker Ridgway headed for his new job : Supreme Commander , Allied Powers Europe . When his Air Force Constellation touched down at Washington 's National Airport one evening last week , Matt Ridgway , a four-star general in midpassage , had a chance to talk to his bosses about the gloomy past and the hopeful , dangerous future . <P> He walked briskly down the gangway with pretty Mary Ridgway and three-year-old Matthew Jr . Then the general was whisked off behind sirens to touch all the main bases in Washington . <P> <P> Sight &; Sound . First there was a private talk with Commander in Chief Harry Truman at the White House , then a nostalgic trip aboard the President 's private train to West Point 's 150th anniversary ceremony ( where Ridgway got his second oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal ) . At midweek he disappeared behind the closed doors of the Senate Armed Services Committee , later went on to Fort McNair for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim in his suntans , he addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress . Twenty-four hours later he spoke to a joint session of Washington 's three top press clubs . <P> At all of his public appearances , his audiences were impressed by his pleasant voice , his modesty and his alert , military bearing . But after he had talked , they could remember very little of what he had said . Generally , Ridgway left the impression that the Administration 's decisions on Korea had been just about flawless , that the MacArthur policies ( although he never mentioned the name ) would have been a mistake , and that the U.S. <P> <P> Eighth Army was amply strong enough to turn back any Communist offensive in Korea . <P> Unchanging Objective . But in private , Ridgway was somewhat franker . At week 's end the Senate Armed Services Committee released a censored account of its interview with Ridgway . Items : <P> Hostile forces , built up during the truce negotiations , now have " a substantially greater offensive potential than at any time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still can inflict " a very severe defeat " if the Communists attempt a " major offensive , " its relative combat strength " is perhaps not as favorable as it was a year ago . " <P> It is " an unchanging Communist objective to obtain control of the entire Korean peninsula " - whether " this year , or five or ten years hence . " The loss of Korea would " very definitely " threaten the security of Japan and " vitally menace the military security of the American people . " <P> In answer to a question about Communist diversionary tactics , General Ridgway replied with one of the basic truths of his time : " Everything these people do all ties into one over-all plan . . . " If the general from Tokyo would remember that simple fact when he took over his new job in Paris , his European mission might work out better than his last assignment .
