THE morning fog lifted . All along the Cote d'Or , the gorgeous Golden Slope of vineyards that tints eastern France for 30 miles , the autumn sun beamed warm rays on the deserted towns . Except for a pair of black-clad grandmothers gossiping on the cobblestones and a couple of overalled , rubber-booted winegrowers closing a deal over a jug of Burgundy in the Cafe de la Cote d'Or , everybody in Nuits-St . Georges ( pop . 3,600 ) - men , women and children , the schoolmaster and even the cure-was out harvesting the new vintage in the heart of France 's Burgundy . <P> " To speak of Burgundy , " say the French , " is to speak of wine . " The bulk of Burgundy 's wine flows to the tables of Lyon , Paris and the world from the high-yielding southern slopes of Beaujolais . But the best of Burgundy , the lordly , full-bodied , velvet reds that made Rabelais shout " How good of God to give us of this juice ! " , the wines that George Meredith called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from a 12,000-acre belt of tiny plots stretching in either direction from Nuits-St . Georges along the Golden Slope . <P> There last week , as fast as they could fill their boat-shaped baskets with the honeycombs of tiny black Pinot grapes , the harvesters spilled them into mule-drawn carts . At Montrachet - whose wine , said Dumas , " ought to be drunk kneeling , with head bared " - around Beaune , at Meursault , Romanee-Conti , Vougeot and Gevrey-Chambertin-each hillside as famous in France as any of Napoleon 's battlefields , it was the same . Off went the grapes , the best first , to be pressed in cellars at the foot of each small field . From the vats within these reeking temples of Bacchus rose the sibilance of juice astir in natural ferment . Once again began the special miracle which the mysteries of soil , sun , slopes and ancestral skills have annually brought to pass in Burgundy since the Romans first planted grapes on the Golden Slope . Andre Noblet , red-faced cellar-master of the Romanee-Conti vineyards , whose 4 acres produce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 1953 ) , sniffed , sampled and thanked heaven for at least three weeks of sunshine after the coldest summer in decades . Said Andre : " 1956 is likely to be a small year-but almost half the wine 's quality is in the work , and we shall nurse ours as we would our children . " <P> <P> Of the finest wines , produced from severely pruned vines , there can never be great quantities . The sad fact was , however , that a vine-killing winter and a rainy , grape-thwarting summer had turned 1956 into a bad year for all western Europe 's winegrowers-a disastrous one for Bordeaux and West Germany , a poor one in both quantity and quality for Burgundy . The government has ' already given Burgundy producers permission to strengthen some of their poorer grades by chaptalization. a doctoring process devised by one Jean Chaptal for adding sugar during fermentation to build up a wine 's alcoholic content . <P>
