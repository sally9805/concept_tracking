Chrysler 's Plymouth division began production last week of a new semiautomatic hydraulic transmission system similar to Dodge 's fluid drive . With it , the clutch is used only to get into high gear and reverse ; after that , no shifting is needed . Plymouth , which will get into full production by April , expects to sell Hy-Drive on 40% of its 1953 output . Cost as optional equipment : $145.80 , or at least $30 cheaper than the automatic drives of competitors .
