We Conquered the Mystery Mountain By GEORGE I. BELL How nine Americans became the first to scale the treacherous peaks of South America 's lost mountain range . e knew that somewhere beyond the dark jungle lay a range of beautiful snowcapped mountains . These were our goals  --  these were the peaks we had come 4000 miles to climb . But when we reached the last outpost of civilization , everyone told us that no such mountains existed . The wealthy hacienda owner , our trusty guides , the Indians who lived nearby  --  all of them agreed that beyond the jungle there were no mountains . It was a puzzle . In planning the expedition , back in the United States , we had anticipated difficulties in reaching the peaks of Pumasillo . We knew that they were not shown on most maps of Peru and that they were misplaced on the few maps where they appeared . Yet , although no European or American had ever been in these mountains , we had been confident of our ability to find them . But now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our peaks . We had met a party of the foremost British mountain climbers who had just spent a month wandering around the jungle valleys looking for the peaks of Pumasillo without success . We met a party of Dutch climbers who swore no such peaks existed . But , finally , we proved that the peaks of Pumasillo were very real . Too real , they seemed , when we were later groping through the storms on their icy flanks . Too real , when Fred Ayres was desperately fighting his way out of an avalanche or when David Michael clawed out of the blackness of a bottomless crevasse which nearly got him . Too real , when Gorky Matthews was starting what she thought would be her last slide down a steep ice slope . The peaks of Pumasillo proved challenging and at times dangerous . But we rose to the challenge and climbed three of the highest summits . More satisfying still was the thrill of exploring and opening up a new and spectacular area to the mountaineering world . Our expedition was inspired by a flight which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austen had flown a small plane down to Peru from the United States and I was accompanying him as photographer and excess baggage . I was to join the Franco-American Andean Expedition of 1952 on the first ascent of the then-unclimbed peak of Salcantay . While we had the plane at Cuzco , Peru , we wanted to take pictures of all the big mountains in the area . These mountains , which are called the Cordillera Vikabamba , are largely surrounded by the jungles of the Amazon basin and hence difficult of access and unexplored . Five hundred or a thousand years ago , the Cordillera Vilcabamba was a great stronghold of the Inca Empire . In times of peace the Incas would govern their empire from the capital at Cuzco , readily accessible from the high Andean plains of Peru and Bolivia . But when enemies threatened Cuzco the Incas could retire to the nearby Cordillera . The Incas had a complex network of roads connecting a series of fortified towns in the Cordillera . Even a modest defense effort , when combined with the formidable natural obstacles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards , in 1532 and 1533 , conquered the Inca , overran most of his empire and occupied Cuzco with ease . But they could not penetrate the Indian defenses in the Cordillera Vilcabamba . The only way to get an over-all view of this formidable Cordillera is to fly over it as Austen Riggs and I did . After photographing Salcantay , we flew westward toward unexplored regions . Soon we found ourselves flying over an unknown area of jagged , savage peaks . Several we judged to be about 20,000 feet in altitude and offering challenging climbs , but unfortunately we had no time for them in 1952 . In the fall of 1955 , several veterans of previous climbs in Peru began to exchange letters . Thus was born the North American Andean Expedition , 1956 . We soon were a strong expedition of nine members . Fred Ayres , who is professor of chemistry at Reed College , Portland , Oregon , has been climbing actively for about twenty-five years . He had been on our first ascent of Salcantay and was the most experienced member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liked the country so much that he decided his wife , Corky , should come along and enjoy it . She is in her own right a skilled rock climber , accustomed to scaling the sheer precipices of Yosemite . Graham teaches history at the Robert Louis Stevenson School for Boys in Pebble Beach , California . Still another Salcantay veteran was David Michael , alias Georgia , who is sort of a struggling artist by profession , Georgia has a fine sense of humor , which makes him an ideal companion in the mountains . Then , like groups of athletes from other modern countries , we had our political officer : Andy Kauffman , of the State Department . Andy had first climbed in Peru in 1941 , and has ever since , f suspect , been hoping to be transferred to our embassy in Lima . Arnold Wexler , a physicist with the National Bureau of Standards in Washington , has spent many summers climbing , and George Arnis , our youngest member , had an advantage over the rest of us , in being a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Growing up at such an altitude , George was little affected by even the 20,000-foot heights of Peru . The party was completed by me and Ginny , my wife , I am a physicist and Ginny is a biochemistry-laboratory technician , and we both work for the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory . Ginny had climbed quite a few of the Colorado Rockies , but this was to be her first encounter with big glacier-hung peaks . Fortunately , with so many members experienced in the pathways and pitfalls of expedition planning , the all-important chores could be shared among us . Arnold Wexler , a number of years ago , made a classic study of the rope stresses involved in arresting the descent of a body which has fallen from some height . So Arnold was a logical choice to take charge of expedition equipment . He devised a complete list , including such diverse items as " one Gerry Himalayan tent , four small whisk brooms , one rotary egg beater , 3000 feet Manila rope , three DDT bombs , " and so on , After each item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition owned and would supply it or whether it had to be purchased . Ginny and 1 planned the food . The procedure was simple . Concentrated and dehydrated , yet appetizing and varied foods were the aim . We went over the lists of previous expeditions and profited from such marginal comments as " great , could have eaten twice as much , " or more often " ugh , gave 40 lbs . to the Indians , " and drew up a list . We figured on about two and a quarter pounds of food per man day . Various special items such as dehydrated soups , instant potato and dehydrated milk were purchased in the United States . But for the most part we counted on getting food in Peru . Graham Matthews volunteered to serve as treasurer . We had estimated the cost of the expedition to be about 31000 per member . Of this amount , somewhat over half was transportation to Peru and back . This was handled on an individual basis . Food , equipment and transportation in Peru were expedition expenses and Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough job of arranging all gear for shipment . By mid-April Fred had seen to it that everything was crated and on a ship for Peru . David Michael , George ArMs and Fred formed our advance party , By June fifteenth , when the rest of us arrived in Lima , they had pushed our gear through customs and bought the remainder of the food . But they had disturbing news . It seemed that an able British party was attempting to scale Pumasillo at that very moment . This group included George Band , who , in 1955 , made the first ascent of Kanchenjunga , long considered impossible to climb . The British had left Lima a month ahead of us and were thus a formidable threat to our making the first ascent of Pumasillo . In addition to the British unit , we found that another party of skilled climbers was active in the Cordillera Vilcabarnba  --  led by one of the world 's great climbers , the French guide Lionel Ter-ray . Terray has made scores of difficult first ascents , including Makalu . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we debated whether we should change our objectives . Finally , one factor proved deciding . We had written Peruvian friends in Cuzco to expect us on June nineteenth and have all in readiness for our immediate take-off for the mountains . These friends , Abel Pacheco and Mayalay Flury , had gone with us to the base of Salcantay on that climb and became fans . They had volunteered to arrange for mules and high-altitude porters and to accompany us to base camp . They were , we assumed , waiting for us in Cuzco . Upon this assumption , we based our decision to fly at once to Cuzco . This decision was backed up by guess that the British might not find Pumasillo . Even if they had found it , we thought they could not climb all its numerous summits , for Pumasillo is more a range of mountains than any single peak . The pilot flew close by Pumasillo at our request and I tried to see how the deep valleys fitted together to give access to the mountains . When we reached Cuzco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone wrong with our plans . After settling ourselves in the government-operated Hotel Cuzco , we wandered about , sight-seeing . Later that afternoon , the French climber , Terray , and his companions unexpectedly arrived at the hotel . They had climbed Salcantay and two other peaks . But we were even more interested to learn that they had been accompanied by none other than our Peruvian friends , Abel and Mayalay . Indeed , Abel had not received our last letter and was not expecting us until much later , No preparations had been made for us . Bad news , for four of us were committed to return to the United States on July twenty-fourth . The next day we discussed plans with Abel , He had morsels of information . First of all , he had heard that the British had gone directly to the railhead at hacienda Huadquina a month before . However , the owner was away at some of his mines and the British were unable to obtain mules to transport their gear . For ten days they had waited at Huadquifia before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shortly thereafter , the owner and mules appeared , but the British had lost nearly two weeks at Huadquifia . They were committed to be back in Cuzco by June twenty-fourth to film the annual Indian festival of the summer solstice . So we were hopeful that they could do little on Pumasillo in such a short time . Next Abel told us that there was no such peak as Pumasillo . Abel had never heard of it , nobody in Cuzco knew of peaks in that area  --  we would be wasting our time . Fortunately , we could produce our aerial photographs and convince Abel that we knew whereof we spoke . We then learned the facts of life at Huadquina . That hacienda was one of the richest in Peru . The owner , Don Alfredo Romaineville , was a self-made man and at Huadquifla his word was absolute law . Don Alfredo was a classic type , " un tiana cfrIsico " ? a huge bear of a man , now in his fifties and almost totally deaf . As a youth he had prospected in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows for company " and he loathed city life . Although immensely wealthy , he even now lived only to work , No one could obtain mules at Huadquifia except through Don Alfredo  --  and he was somewhat allergic to mountain climbers . But , added Abel with a flourish , " Don Alfredo is a good friend of mine . " Abel has a substantial hacienda of his own near Cuzco and could thus deal with Don Alfredo as an equal  --  well , almost . Abel agreed to get in touch with Don Alfredo at once , but he thought that it would be at least a week before we could leave Huadquifia . We were unhappy to lose more time , but there seemed little that could be done . And this would give us a chance to meet the British and find what they had done . So we resigned ourselves to some of the tourist attractions near Cuzco . We spent three days at Machu Picchu , sacred Inca city of stone . This ruin , about seventy miles from Cuzco , is on a precipitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knifes its way through the heart of the Cordillera Vilcabamba . The granite gorge of the tintbamba , 10,000 feet deep , provides a spectacular backdrop for the austere rock artistry of the Incas . Since the tiny Machu Picchu Hotel was full , we pitched our tents near the ruins . Huadquina is only about ten miles from Machu Picchu and while at the ruins we were surprised by a chance meeting with the British expedition , en route to Cuzco . George Band told us that they had followed high passes for two weeks and that they had gone completely around Pumasillo , but that they had found no way whatsoever to get to its base . The mystery mountains remained inviolate . He had heard that the valley we wanted to follow was impassable . Then came more bad news  --  Abel called to say that Romaineville had laid down the law : " No mules until July fifths . " Finally , on June twenty-ninth , we were made welcome at Huadquina by the daughters of Don Alfredo Romaineville . That evening I asked Henrique Romaineville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the valley of the Rio Fluadquifia where we wished to go . He told us that the British had were misunderstood ? there March 2 , 1057 two passable trails part way up the valley . One went through the jungle to the little Indian village of Sacsara , but , he added , " there are no big mountains near Sacsara , just hills . " And so it went . The few people who had ever heard of Sacsara would tell us nothing of mountains there . It was a puzzle . Our course of action was clear . A reconnaissance party must go to Sacsara and prove that Pumasillo was there . On June thirtieth , Andy , Arnold , Graham and George Arnis set off with three porters whom Abel had hired for us . At the same time the rest of us poked up another possible valley from Huadquifianamely , the one followed by the British . On July third , the porters returned from Sacsara with the wonderful news that they had found Pumasillo . The trail was more or less passable and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next day it looked as if we might never reach it . Don Alfredo had returned to his hacienda and we told him the good news . But he was unimpressed . There were no mountains at Sacsara ; it would be folly to take mules to Sacsara . Abel came to our rescue at that point . Mules he had promised , and mules we should have . Mules we got . But the question remained in our minds for a long time : Why did Don Alfredo say there were no mountains above Sacsara ? It is possible that he did n't know of them . But it is also very possible that he did not believe we were mere mountain climbers . but thought we were prospectors . Naturally , he would want to discourage the prospecting of mining country which he himself had not scoured for minerals . We had foolishly shown him a Geiger counter which we had brought for amusement . Perhaps this had confirmed his suspicions . The trail from Huadquifia to Sacsara was a route we shall not soon forget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Soon we were surrounded by a wall of vines , creepers and bamboo . Often the trail was hacked in the face of a cliff , but so thick was the vegetation that it was hard to tell whether you were putting your foot down on rock or thin air . We spent the afternoon and night in Indian huts at a clearing called Incahuasi , or " place of the Inca . " Those of us who were on foot arrived long before the mules and we were welcomed by the Indian women and children . They had never seen or even heard of Americans . Abel arrived at the head of the mule train just after dark  --  and he brought bad news . A mute was missing ; he had apparently somehow wandered from the trail . Abel was furious at the mule drivers . A search for the mule that night proved fruitless . Early the next morning . Abel retraced the trail for several miles and found where the unlucky mule had misjudged his footing and plunged through a fragile wall of greenery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule had been instantly killed . It was only with great difficulty that Abel and his aides could reach the animal and salvage the waterlogged load . Shortly above Incahuasi , the trail became a miserable series of mudholes . It began to rain . But we persevered and eventually the jungle thinned . We moved farther up the valley , made rendezvous with our reconnaissance party and established base camp at 13,000 feet . We were 8000 feet above Huadquifia . The campsite was , Andy told us , very convenient for attempts on several of the highest peaks of the Pumasillo chain . But while we pitched camp and for sev eral days thereafter , the presence of high mountains was indicated by faith alone  --  for clouds and gently falling snow obscured any scenery farther away than a few hundred yards . At first we did not mind the snow . We had to pitch tents , organize climbing equipment , check food , sort personal gear  --  there was a host of other tasks to occupy us . But after the first day , this bad weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had one clear morning and took advantage of it to investigate two peaks . The word " Pumasillo " appears to mean " Claws of the Puma , " and this was an apt description of the range . From the Sacsara valley we could count twelve snow-capped summits . The peaks were very steep near their summits and thus , from some distance , resembled the upthrust claws of a puma . Indeed , - none of the three major summits we scaled was large enough to accommodate a standing man comfortably . Four peaks , or claws , were higher than the rest . Together they formed a crest which , at about 20,000 feet , dominated the range . The highest point was probably at the north end of the crest ; we knew from our aerial photos that it would best be attempted from the west . From the Sacsara valley , which was unfortunately east of the crest , it would be a very perilous climb . We called this peak " Hard Pumasillo . " At the south end of the crest was the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower than the highest . We called this one " Easy Pumasillo , " but it turned out that this was is misnomer . " Easy Pumasillo " ? or Lasunayoc , as the natives called it  --  is a sublime symmetric pyramid of ice and rock which completely dominates the Sacsara valley . This was to be our first objective . Because our party was so large , we decided to divide and try another beautiful ice peak , Ccollpachinac Human , which rose directly above base camp . When the weather finally improved , on July eleventh , we set out as two parties to attempt Lasunayoc and Ccollpachinac Human . The Lasunayoc party was composed of Andy , Arnold , Georgia and " Lonesome George . " ( By this time we had experienced some confusion with two Georges and one Georgia on the trip and bachelor George Arnis had acquired the nickname of " Lonesome George . " ) They swiftly followed a route up a glacier to the base of the final ice pyramid . The summit was still 1500 feet above , and all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an angle between that of a roof and a steeple . For hours they hacked steps with their ice axes and tied themselves to long iron pitons which they drove into the ice to safeguard their advance . By late afternoon they had climbed only about 600 feet and were becoming convinced that another side of the mountain offered a better route . Meanwhile , Fred Ayres , Graham and Corky Matthews , Ginny and I were attempting Ccollpachinac Human , We found a beautiful meadow for our camp near the snout of a glacier . The view was so splendid that next morning we wasted a precious hour taking photographs . We could see our friends at work on Lasunayoc . Ccollpachinac Human is a peak of classic beauty and would have been a glorious climb had it not been for all the fresh snow which hampered our advance . We kicked steps up slopes of loose powder snow to gain a ridge which we hoped would offer better going . This was Ginny 's first time on a glacier and I was naturally happy to see that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ridge offered matchless views . But we soon had to cross some big crevasses , and then , as Ginny glanced down into their seemingly bottomless cold blue depths , she wondered if glaciers were much fun after all . Gentle slopes led to some ice cliffs below the summit towers . Punching steps in the deep snow on these slopes was slow and tiring work . By this time clouds had settled around us , and Ginny , whose hands and feet were now soaked by melting snow , decided that glaciers had their definite drawbacks . Fred and I turned to do battle with the deep snow . As Fred was plowing a waist-deep trench toward the cliffs , there wassudden ly a sharp hissing sound and the snow around Fred began to slide down the mountain . I thought Fred was in serious trouble . But fortunately he was near the edge of the slide and a few frantic lunges carried him to solid snow . This had been only a small slide , but it made us acutely conscious of the hazards of a big one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther ahead and at the marry big crevasses , we reluctantly returned to base camp . The next morning we held a council of war . Two attempts , no ascents , and Andy , 99 Arnold , Ginny and I would have to leave in a week . We agreed that Lasunayoc was now the objective , and finally decided to shift our attack to its southeastern side . Accordingly , on July fourteenth , Georgia , Fred , Lonesome George and I set out for the southeastern flank of Lasunayoc with three sturdy porters . Graham , who had seen the southeastern side on reconnaissance and had a route in mind , went ahead to prove it out . Around noon he found an excellent site for camp on a prominent rock buttress between two big icefalls . We had climbed nearly 3000 feet from base camp and it was beginning to snow . We pitched camp and Graham and the porters returned to base camp . In the morning we climbed to the top of our buttress to search for a route . Immediately ahead we found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbled icefall . Still higher there appeared to be another plateau , out of which rose the summit pyramid . Our first problem was clearly the big icefall . This icefall was formed where the Lasunayoc glacier cascaded over a continuity of rock cliffs . These tended to break the glacier into a series of impassable ice cliffs . A route had to be found between them . The icefall , nearly 3090 feet high and a mile wide , was in many places is wilderness of tumbled skyscrapers of ice . We set off across the plateau . At first we made good headway , but then we encountered deep snow . We could see where slopes had avalanched and we had to use extreme care to avoid being caught in any snowslide . Now the clouds , boiling up out of the Amazon basin , closed in on us . This proved to be typical  --  clear before ten A.M. , then clouds and intermittent snow . We paused for lunch on a level spot  --  a good site for the next camp . It was protected from anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet wide and a hundred deep . That afternoon deep snow , avalanche conditions , zero visibility and crevasses made the route-finding tricky . For several hours we probed ahead but time and again we were brought up short in the maze of giant crevasses and ice cliffs . We groped back down to Camp The next day the porters carried up Camp 11 to our previous flat lunch spot . By the time we reached it , we were in the clouds again and could see little . But the visibility was slightly better than the previous day and we spent all afternoon looking for the route above . The deep snow not only made for avalanches and hard labor but it concealed crevasses , Of course , we always proceeded roped together with strong nylon line which can hold a 3000-pound pull . But Georgia had a close call . While casually crossing a most innocent-looking flat stretch of snow , his footing suddenly collapsed and he had the sickening sensation of plunging into a big crevasse . Fortunately his shoulder and elbow caught on one side and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastened to his boot stuck OD the other . The combination threatened to break hint in two , but after a few frantic seconds of struggle he was able to escape from this awkward position . After this , we would never allow slack to accumulate in the rope between two climbers , The next morning we followed.another promising route with high hopes . But it was blocked higher up by a crevasse twenty feet wide and five times as deep . Above rose two ice cliffs  --  each overhanging , and the height of a five-story building . This iccfall just seemed to be built wrong . So we tried yet another route , which we called " Ski Alley . " This was a gentle crevassed corridor which appeared to lead nowhere , but which , in fact , enabled us to sneak past all of the big ice cliffs and reach the summit plateau . Here we had a brief glimpse of the summit pyramid before it was swallowed by driving snow . The next morning Fred was up cooking breakfast at the heroic hour of 3:45 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the upper plateau , where we spied a likely route to the base of an ice cliff some 200 feet below the summit of the final ice pyramid . But following it was another matter . The plateau was drifted with bottomless snow and it took three hours of steady toil to punch our way to the , base of the pyramid . By then the clouds were upon us , as usual . We started up through recent avalanche debris . Above this was a steep slope  --  perhaps 400 feet in height and obviously prone to avalanche again . Our hearts were in our throats as Fred kicked the long flight of steps up this unstable horror . But it held . By the time we reached the ridge , visibility had decreased to only a few feet . As 1 advanced along the ridge , nothing could be seen . Cloud-filled space was indistinguishable from snow . I would poke ahead with my ice ax to locate the crest of the ridge and then advance a foot . The snow was an evil formation known as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fracture into great blocks , which slide off the mountain at high speed . But in due course the ultimate cliff loomed ahead . Here we paused for lunch and quiet meditation , We thought that perhaps the cliff could be by-passed on the left , Accordingly , l tiptoed in that direction . The prospect was forbidding , I stood at the top of vertical rock cliffs that plunged out of sight into the clouds below . I was still separated by thirty feet of steep ice and snow from the ice cliff proper , But that cliff looked like an impossible overhanging honeycomb of rotten ice . 1 tiptoed back to the others and announced that , as a conservative married man , I judged the route to be impractical . At that point , Fred , a fearless bachelor , tiptoed out for a look . He was not so easily daunted . He carved out a perilous route to the base of the ice cliff . He swatted at it in disgust once or twice , but to scale it was clearly hopeless . It could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There remained hope that one could make a long traverse below the ice cliff to the right and finally get around it . But time did not remain for the attempt that day . The next day I had to start out to Huadquina with Ginny and Arnold . All hands retired to Camp I and base camp to regroup for the final assault on Lasunayoc , As soon as l left , I am told , the weather took a turn for the better . By July twenty-third , Graham , Georgia , Fred and Lonesome George were ready to renew the attack on Lasunayoc . The porters had moved up high camp to the head of Ski Alley . From this higher location they hoped the summit would be more easily attainable . Fresh snow had drifted into our old tracks across the plateau , so that a new trail had to be punched out . But by ten in the morning they had reached our previous high point and were beginning a delicate traverse to the right underneath the overhanging ice cliff . Beneath them still larger ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They scaled a short icicle-draped cliff to gain a long shelf between the two levels of big cliffs . They then followed the shelf for several hundred yards until finally the ultimate cliff eased back into a somewhat less than vertical slope which led them to the summit ridge . The apex of Lasunayoc was a blade of snow so thin and insecure that they dared have only one man at a time inch his way to the top while securely held on a rope by the others . Clouds were billowing about , so they wasted little time on the inhospitable summit of " Easy Pumasillo . " Next on the list of unfinished business was Ccollpachinac Human . On July twenty-sixth all hands scaled one of its summit towers , only to find that strict honesty compelled them to note that another and much harder tower was at least five feet higher . So on July twenty-eighth Graham , Fred , and Lonesome George returned for this pinnacle . They left camp by moonlight and were only a few hundred feet below the top by dawn . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bottomless snow , they were confronted by a final 175-foot snow steeple . Graham did some bold leading up this dangerous fluted slope . When , hours later , they reached the summit , it was to be greeted by a stomach-wrenching view down the north side . No one dared stand upright on the summit , of Ccollpachinac Human  --  what held it together was a complete mystery . Later , the party climbed one other nice peak  --  the Indians called it Ttiyuyocwe nicknamed it " Ladies ' Day . " Here , too , the summit proved to be an incredible snow ornament , more the product of a disordered imagination than a bit of terra firma . With two more minor summits , the expedition had thus scaled six of the peaks of Pumasilla  --  about as many as we had ever hoped to get . I have to admit that my own recollections of the trip are tarnished by memories of unnecessary delay , and of having to leave before any climbs were completed . But these are merely minor elements in an otherwise pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area to the mountaineering world . I was happy to introduce Ginny to a land of high mountains and happier still that she enjoyed this land , But the primary joy was simply that of climbing on beautiful mountains . I have learned that men climb mountains for as many reasons as there are climbers . I know that some have climbed with motives that are ignoble  --  spurred on perhaps by hate , or jealousy , or a mean ambition , But I like to think that usually this is not so and that in climbing we come to know a high religion , truly and deeply . I remember one evening when four of us were standing outside the tents at Camp II on Lasunayoc . The storm clouds of the afternoon had cleared and all around us we saw the virgin whiteness of powder snow . The sun was low in the west and its slanting rays shone on the summits of the highest peaks of the Cordillera Vilcabamba . Finally , only the tip of Salcantay was lighted by the dying sun . Then at twilight we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blackness of the Amazon jungle to the northeast . Such a scene spoke only of the majesty of nature and the vain and fleeting quality of human endeavor . Then I heard the purring of the gasoline stove cooking supper ; I smelled the boiling stew . And , looking around , I saw my three companions  --  and our two little tents perched here on the side of this mountain . The nylon ropes , crampons and ice axes were neatly arranged outside for the climb next morning . Then I knew that this climb we had set ourselves  --  to scale the ice slopes of Pumasillo  --  was a joyful affirmation of the vitality of the human spirit .
