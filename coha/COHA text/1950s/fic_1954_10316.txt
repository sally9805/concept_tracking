, or whether , once they were over , they simply and irretrievablyvanished . The party was large and gay and noisy . Hugo 's apartment took up the whole top story of an old , graystone building , and had a terrace which overlooked the Park . When Julian and Sylvia came in , Hugo pushed his way toward them , bringing martinis . " You already know Louisa , " he said proudly , bringing her forward . " Here is Mrs. Leonard , Louisa 's mother , and her sister , Elaine . You know everyone else . " It was always the fiction , at Hugo 's parties , that everyone knew everyone else ; Julian never failed to be amazed , however , at the extent of his friend 's acquaintance ; on a quick first look around he saw almost no one whom he knew . The invitationhad been for cocktails , and read " five to eight o'clock , " but the host typically in such a case provided an enormous buffet , and most likely no one who counted himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , or provided himself with any other entertainment during the whole evening . Louisa was slender-waisted and handsome , with very large , black eyes , and long , black hair falling free over her shoulders ; a girl who wore massive , crude bracelets of hammered silver , and somewhat suggested a goddess of battles . When Julian had met her before , in less public circumstances , she had seemed subdued and rather maidenly , but now a certain wild emanation of power possibly without control frightened more than it charmed him , and he gathered that she was already a little drunk . He envied Hugo his girl 's youth  --  it was perhaps typical of Julian in his present state of mind to think of this marriage as in effect a transfusion of blood  --  while at the same time , youth or no youth , and through all the finep101ripeness of complexion , sparkle of eyes and freedom of movement , he thought dourly that one detected already in the elder Miss Leonard the possibility and even the probability of Mrs. Leonard , with her pinched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hugo had spoken so often about Sylvia and Julian , she had been longing to meet them . Now that she had met them , however , there seemed to be little more to be done about it , and Mrs. Leonard stood stiffly before them for a moment , then lunged away to the left with her cocktail glass extended . Hugo took Louisa suddenly away to be introduced to new guests , Sylvia too turned aside , rather becauseof the unwritten rule that one did not hang about one 's husband than because she particularly wanted to talk to anyoneelse , and Julian was left in a little clear space with Elaine Leonard . This girl was smaller than her sister , she came about to Julian 's shoulder , and , in his opinion , which he gave himself as a connoisseur , quite pretty ; the combination of black hair , cut short , and blue eyes , with intensely white skin and teeth , was pleasing , it had an extraordinary delicacy delightfully set off by a smile which was slightly crooked and eccentric , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though , behind the young lady which she of course was , there now and then looked forth another creature of gamine artlessness and honesty and , perhaps , impudence . All this Julian perceived with great objectivity , with aestheticdistance , and would perhaps have had no further interestin Elaine , whom he considered too young , had she not at once said something quite arresting to him . " Do you know who you look like , very much ? " And , as Julian winced slightly , " You must have heard this a hundred times before  --  you look exactly like Federigo Schwartz . " So , then , his name was Schwartz ? With a certain superiorp102irony Julian patted the right-hand pocket of his coat , and felt through the material the envelope of the first of Federigo 's letters , which had been there since the morning . " How do you know I 'm not ? " he asked , with a teasing smile . The girl looked at him steadily for a moment before replying . " Oh , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as strict as Federigo , and your eyes  --  I think  --  are lighter . " " My eyes are quite dark , " said Julian , a little piqued . " But Federigo 's are black , absolutely black . And anyhow , I do n't believe you could be Federigo , because , you see , he 's supposed to be off on a world cruise . " " Supposed to be  --  ? " " I mean , it 's hard to know exactly , with Federigo , " Elaine said seriously . " He is a secretive sort of person , and he 'd as soon lie to you as not . Anyhow , about the world cruise , I did n't hear it from him , you know . Someone just said the other day that he had sailed . He has his own boat . " " Do you know him well , this Federigo ? " " Oh , no , I 've just met him a few times . But you must know him , surely , " she added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a large city , " said Julian . " I have heard of him but never met him . " " Probably , " Elaine said , " he goes around pretending to be you , and getting you into trouble . It must be marvelous to have someone who looks exactly like you , " she added . Julian considered this statement with some care . " Well , " he said , " he has n't signed my name to any checks , at least not so far . " " And have you signed his name to any ? " asked Elaine . The course of the party would imitate in little the growth and decay of civilizations , thought Marius as he stood on thep103edge of this one . In the beginning , a few isolated pairs and groups regarded one another suspiciously , like peoples whose sacred books tell them they alone were made by the gods , and who now have to account for the Ammonites and Edomites who surround them . Presently , a little commerce developed , assisted by the co-operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cultures  --  and larger groups began to form , with migrations from one part of the room to another . Then , as if on a signal , everyone began to co-operate on building the Tower of Babel ; all conversations became one , and all conversations became unintelligible , oftenquite literally in a number of different languages . There would follow a dispersion of the nations from this Plain of Shinar , and for a while all would be flux and chaos ; the personwith whom one believed oneself to be talking would suddenlyno longer be there , would be replaced in mid-sentence by another or by several others , but all this would seem scarcely to matter , one ear being as good as the next . Then , slowly , more permanent arrangements and alignments would develop ; as the weak fell by the way , the nations whose name was Historybegan to form the true , the intimate and mystical body of the party , from whose behavior general laws might be deduced ; and it was at that time  --  still , for this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polyhistors , the great talkers and consecutive , traditionary thinkers , of whose number Marius accounted himself one , would step in to make continuity and a certain amount of sense of the business beforean enthralled auditory . And then , once that great age had run its course , not without a further defection of the drunk and lecherous , would follow the modern period of arrogance , quarrels , fights ( often enough ) and rather pathetic , careless libertinism ; until at last the pitiful remnant perceiveditself to be huddled in isolation and silence among thep104ashes and cigar butts and the ruined glasses . Then  --  in the gray , cold light  --  everyone would go home , and that was a metaphor , thought Marius , for , quite literally , The Lord Knew What . He made his way through the crowd to Julian Ghent and Elaine Leonard , who were now standing together as if they did not know why , in silence ; to them he repeated the substanceof what he had just thought concerning parties and world history . It fell quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marius concluded they could not have heard all he said , the clamor around them was terrific . Still , the silence at the center of it , where they stood , became noticeable , and to make conversation Marius said : " I suppose Sylviatold you , Julian , we had a quite amusing afternoon drivingout to see Alma . " He turned to Elaine and added , " Mrs. Alter as is , " to which Elaine replied , " I know . " This little exchangegave Julian time to compose his face , which neverthelesslooked a trifle grim . " Yes , Sylvia said , " he drawled with such ease and assurancethat Marius at once perceived Sylvia had said nothing of the sort . The idiot , he thought , she wants to dramatize everything . He smiled boldly up at Julian , who was taller than he . " Let me get us some more to drink , " Julian said , taking their glasses , and he edged away through the crowd toward the bar . " And you are the sister of the bride-to-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Elaine . " I gather , " she replied , " you are one of Hugo 's loyal friends who believe he is making a dreadful mistake ? " " Oh , no , " he said . " I do n't make judgments . " " What do you do , then ? " " I watch , " said Marius with great gravity . " I watch the comedy go by . "  |p105Elaine  thought him an oddly pompous person , but at the same time felt some sort of alliance with him , perhaps becausethey were both younger than the general run of people there ; also , of course , they were single , which in that gatheringwas not the usual thing to be . She could think of him as a boy , which of course was impossible with Hugo and Mr. Ghent and people like that . " You would n't by any chance be one of the clowns yourself ? " she asked , smiling her crooked and charming smile . " You see through my disguise , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a wonderful time . " What a delightful girl , he thought , and considered the likelihood of his falling in love with her there and then  --  for that smile alone , if for nothing else . Julian now returned with the drinks . He was furious with Sylvia , also secretly pleased . There were secrets after all , then . Federigo , he told himself , was real . At the same time , looking at Marius rather carefully , he did not believe that this young man made love to Sylvia . A litle pipsqueak intellectual , he thought , and poor at that . It was ridiculous . Nevertheless , Sylvia had kept it secret . Julian experienced a certainpride of power in the advantage he seemed to gain by knowing this small fact ; he personally became the irony of fate , and felt , as he handed Marius a martini , as though the pearl onion in its depths had been poisoned . Oh , dear , Marius thought as he accepted the drink , smiling again at Julian , is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole evening , not caringin the least whether this would allay her husband 's suspicionsor intensify them , but simply to punish her for this piece of what he called romanticism . " Here 's to us all , " said Elaine , raising her glass and smilingimpartially at both of them.  |p106It  was all very well , thought Sylvia with some annoyance , to decide that one would treat Marius with exactly the considerationone gave to others , not more and not less , but it was disturbingto have no opportunity whatever to put this excellent plan into effect . It was getting late , everyone had already eaten , and Marius , who by now had formed about himself a small cohort of people , out on the terrace , to whom he was being witty , had at most nodded twice to her across the room . She resented this rudeness on his part , and considered that if he valued her friendship , to mention nothing more , he had best be somewhat more demonstrative . Sylvia , for all her recently developed line of psychiatric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society . She was rather slow , and did not like conversations which quickly broke off , or groups which constantly changed their compositionwhile one thought what to say next . She preferred that stage , rather late in a party , at which it was possible to have a long , serious talk with some one agreeable person , a programwhich had only the one difficulty attached to it , that the gentlemen who most readily settled down to such a long , serioustalk were also those most likely to want to take her off in some dark corner or down the hall to a bedroom . For these reasons she had not , so far , been enjoying herself at all ; she felt bored and very self-conscious , as though everyonewould notice how much she stood alone . She was also drinking more than usual , perhaps for no better reason than that , where she was standing , there was no place to put down the glass , which accordingly she raised to her lips nervously every few seconds . Hugo came over to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she felt humbly grateful , and smiled up at him . Hugo was rather drunk , and leaned on her heavily . " Having a good time , darling ? "  | " It 's a lovely party , Hugo , " she replied . " It is , is n't it ? Everyone happy , having a good time . No harm in that , is there ? " he demanded sternly . Sylvia was reflecting , rather vaguely , that this was the man , this one with his arm carelessly flung about her , who had first known her body . Here they were , eight years older , or nine years . It seemed horrible , and yet as though it visibly proved nothing ever mattered ; she felt slightly faint , and as if she and Hugo were withdrawn into a space of silence amid the noise , a perceptible isolation . Something of this feeling must have transmitted itself to Hugo . " We 've never talked about that time , " he said , somewhat aggressively . " No , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , " he said , though Sylvia considered this to be no great achievement ; what else would she be thinking ? But Hugo became very serious . " I never would have forgiven myself , " he said heavily , " if anything had happened to you then . " " Do you think that was nothing ? " she bitterly asked him , thinking how odd it was that she and this large body next to her had together made a child , which of course could not be allowed to be born , much less to live , grow up , die  --  the wretched thing , whatever it was , and nameless at that , had not even had time enough to die . Likely enough she could never have another . Hugo thought that was nothing . " I mean , " he largely explained , with a gesture of the hand , as though this party itself were one of the results of their union , " it 's all worked out , has n't it ? You and Jay , my dearest friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he admonished her . " He 's a good man . And you 're a good girl , Sylvia . SometimesI think you two are the only really happy people I know . I hope it will be like that with Louisa and me. "  | " And Alma , " Sylvia could not resist adding . Hugo took his arm away and turned to face her . " I know , " he said mournfully . " You need n't push it . You could n't make me feel more of a failure than I do already . Believe me , Sylvia , I know I 'm to blame  --  but what can I do , what can I do about it now ? " He looked down at her with an expression of pathetic and childish helplessness . " I just am that way , " he pleaded , adding , with some smug satisfaction , " but my Louisa will keep me in line  --  look at her over there . " He pointed out on the terrace , to the group around Marius Rathlin . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " said Hugo . Sylvia watched Louisa drain the remains of her drink and hand the glass to a young man with a crew-cut who made off toward the bar . She was glad that Hugo could see this as a demonstration of strength of character . " Tell me , seriously , Sylvia , " Hugo said , " does Jay know what happened with us ? " " He has never known you were involved , " she replied . " Of course , he had to know about the child  --  and I presume , " she added with an angry smile , " he may have deduced some prior sexual activity from that . " " Do n't joke , darling , " Hugo said . " I 've always felt badly about that . Sometimes I think I owe it to Julian to let him know , and you do , too . This way , it 's like holding a dirty joke over his head  --  if you see what I mean . " " I really do n't see what would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say , " she added , " that every cell in one 's body is replaced in a matter of seven years . The people we were then must be outlawed by the statute of limitations , or something . " " Believe me , Sylvia , " Hugo said , " I 've always been attracted to you . If I were n't a reformed character  --  " He broke off , laughing , and took her arm . " Let 's go out on the terrace , "  |p109he  said , " and listen to Marius being witty , if that is what Marius is being . " " I 'd really be just as pleased , Hugo , " said Sylvia , " if you could control your sudden access of conscience to the point of not confessing to Julian . A wife 's job is difficult enough without that . " They strolled together out on the terrace . AT eleven-thirty Julian abruptly left the party . He spoke to no one , and it did not seem likely that anyone had seen him go . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it was characteristic of Hugo 's larger parties to proliferate , late in the evening , half over town ; people went to nightclubs , for rides in automobiles , to other parties ; then , sometimes , they came back . Doubtless his lust for the strange girl Bianca had been developingunconsciously in him almost from the moment he had left his wife 's arms several hours before . But this simple motive would not by itself have been strong enough to overcomethe guilt it evoked , and therefore employed those hours in allying itself with consciousness and reason , and building a complex structure of rationale whereby the act itself might be supported . By the time he left , this rationale , for all practicalpurposes , had replaced in his mind the motive of lust ; to the extent that he told himself , in the elevator , that he was merely going to walk once or twice around the block , and not until he found he was walking rapidly down Fifth Avenue , on the Park side , did he fully acknowledge again what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place . . . But there was no orderly arrange/ment of reasons , they tumbled extravagantly one over the other like the explanations of a guilty schoolboy who does not see that one excuse is infinitely better than two . What it all came down to , though , was that he was angry ( Sylvia ) , drunk ( himself ) and bored ( the party ) . He had been one of the group surrounding Marius Rathlin on the terrace . It was true that Marius talked brilliantly and was amusing , particularly when he became a little drunk . But what was all this , thought Julian disgustedly , but talk talk talk ? What had it to do with anything that mattered ? Sylvia had lied to him by failing to mention Marius ; this caused Julian a bitter satisfaction , it represented an opportunity , the world implied so tenuously and delicately in the anonymous letter began to exist . Here was Marius , now , talking ( as though that world did not exist ) about religion . Marius was wearing his lecturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity that further annoyed Julian , who moved a little away from the group and stood by the railing of the terrace , where he abstractedly entertained for a moment the idea of throwing himself down on the street . Beyond lay in silence Central Park , a darkness thinly laced with lights ; while he watched , a traffic light changed from red to green out there in the black space . Bianca would be walking , perhaps , toward the Zoo , toward the pool , where he imagined the seals , silent and unwatched now , plunging swiftly through the opacity of the waters . He was bored . Out there , somehow , in the silent spaces of the Park  --  where he had played as a child , and how far away that was !  --  lay life , impulse , secrecy ; while up here on Hugo 's fine terrace there was talk . Marius was praising Catholicism now on aesthetic and  --  of all things  --  hygienic grounds ; he developed the paradox that it was the most satisfactoryreligion " for a gentleman " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animism , " the nasty practices of the heathen , " Catholicism did not deny these things but rather sanctified them , drew them up into grace ; it gave the believer a wide and living world . Thus Marius . But Julian considered that all these fine ladies and gentlemen gathered here , listening to the fine talk , kept in their hearts the secret of lust , that their inmost thoughts were concentrated on sex , that madness thinly veiled possessed them all , the madness which all the forces of society seemed designed at once to provoke and restrain but never to allay . " Therefore , " he said to himself , " we live in hypocrisy . I am not alone , but I am merely bitten by the same great louse which crawls in the night from bed to bed . " But this acknowledgmentmade him feel more alone than ever . He was drunk , though only to that point at which he had a magnified view of his own powers and of what was possible . Because his thoughts were secret , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the house . Julian was fifteen minutes beforehand at the rendezvous ; this annoyed him . Like a schoolboy , he thought . The loneliness of the Zoo frightened him somewhat ; what seemed the laughter of beasts in distant cages intensified the silence which appeared to him to belong to his own moral isolation . Bright green leaves whispered and waved about the globe of a nearby lamp , and the sidewalk beneath reflected a million particles of gray , stone light ; it might have been a landscape on the moon . The dark waters of the seal pool rolled uneasily , the oily surface caught occasional ripples of light . A seal barked loudly close at hand , and Julian jumped . A policeman passed under the street lamp across the pool and seemed to be eying Julian closely , but said nothing and went on , the metal plates of his heels striking the pavement in a measured beat  |p112Perha|ps  she would not come ? At this moment Julian hoped she would not . He allowed himself five minutes more , then he would take a taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he had never left it . In the darkness behind him animals groaned and chuckled as though in uneasy sleep . Bianca came from the shadows and took his arm . She was wearing a white dress , sleeveless and loosely cut . Julian found his heart beating very rapidly , and he imposed upon himself feelings of desperate gaiety . At one instant he thought : no one will ever know . At the next instant he thought that it would always be possible to kill himself afterward . " Where shall we go ? " he asked , noticing that his voice shook in the attempt to keep its tone light and casual . " I know a place , " she replied almost in a whisper , and he allowed himself to be led away . They walked westward , out of the Zoo , through a tunnel smelling of urine , up a dark path . Julian put his arm around Bianca 's waist , his hand slipped down to rest on the curve of her backside , which hardened and softened agreeably with the rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing on under her dress , and he confirmed this observation by sliding his hand up to touch her breast , at which she leaned closer to him and rested her head on his neck so that he smelled again , in some excitement , the strong , raw perfume with which she seemed almost drenched . Julian 's heart was pounding , his mind was shaken by a feeling of wild freedom in which nothing , not the most horrifying or perverse imaginings from dreams , would be forbidden him . The strange thought came into his head that he wished Bianca would resist so that he might rape her . Possiblyhe would kill her afterwards . Presently , in a place of darkness , she led him aside from the path . They clambered hand in hand up fairly steep slopesp113of rock , then into a grove of young trees . She turned to face him , and for a moment they stood apart . " All right . Now , " he heard her say in a new , sharp voice , and almost at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , while something else , harder than a fist , came at him from in front and smashed against his nose and mouth . He was thrown heavily to the ground and kicked once or twice , more with contempt , perhaps , than to hurt . " Go over him good , " the girl said . " The bastard 's married , too . " Great indignation in her voice , thought Julian , who did not altogether lose consciousness under several more blows in the face . He felt his coat wrenched around under him , the lining tore out . Someone with a flashlight looked into his wallet ; an inadvertent motion of the light disclosed the two young men , the black and the white , who had been standing behind Bianca that afternoon at the Zoo . One of them , in darknessagain , knelt and took Julian 's wrist watch . Bianca whispered to them to hurry , he felt a final kick under the ribs , then there was silence and darkness . After a few moments Julian sat up and took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was able to move all his limbs . The taste of blood was in his mouth , and he felt a trickle down his neck also ; the place where he had cut himselfshaving had been opened up again . For all this , he felt strangely light and peaceful , almost amused . The suddenness of the attack had given him no time to be afraid , and the entire affair had been over very quickly . Of course , it was disagreeable to lose one 's wallet and watch and be beaten up at the same time , but Julian 's sense of a merited punishment , and one which , moreover , had both anticipated and prevented the crime it punished , gave him anp114odd feeling of relief . With his clothing torn , blood on his face and collar , he thought gratefully that he had done nothing wrong , that the situation had not changed , that inwardly , by the preservation of grace , he was still the man he had been . A disagreeable thought struck him : would this assault be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to some forty dollars , his name , address , et cetera . Suddenly he remembered the anonymous letter ; to his great relief this was still in the side pocket of his coat . Probably , he decided , such people did not go in for blackmail ; criminals , he had heard , usually stuck to one line of work ; and perhaps these little wretches could not even write . This educated thought a little restored his confidence . Just now Julian realized , in a moment of quiet terror , that he was not alone . Someone , a white jacket faintly glimmering , sat beside him on the ground . Out of the darkness a voice spoke . " Poor dear , " it said . " Poor lamb , you have had a bad time , have n't you ? " The voice  --  a man 's voice  --  was gentle , caressing , faintly ironic at the same time . The expressions it employed seemed to Julian faintly effeminate , and suggestive of the character of a male nurse . Now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The handkerchief was wet , but smelled slightly also of some sort of toilet water . Julian pushed it away . " I 'm perfectly all right , " he said severely , but discovered on trying to stand up that this statement was an exaggeration . The stranger gently and firmly helped him to his feet and supportedhim with an arm around his waist . " Here , try to walk a step or so , " the voice advised him . " I 'll hold you . " With the stranger 's assistance Julian was able to get on ,  |p115lim|ping  slightly , and even to get down the rocks to the path . They walked on together . " You must feel an awfully foolish boy , " the voice said out of darkness , its tone both soothing and distantly amused . " You ought to have someone to take care of you . " " I appreciate your help , " said Julian , " but , if you do n't object , we wo n't discuss the matter . " " Embarrassment , oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his tongue several times , most disagreeably to Julian . " You 've made a positive ass of yourself , and you 're afraid I know it . " There followed on this a loud , rather too musical laugh . Then they came into the light of a street lamp . Julian , turning , looked into his own face , his own eyes . The stranger  --  if he could be called that  --  met his gaze steadily and coldly , with a smile which Julian was unable to return and which caused him finally to drop his eyes . " Yes , " said the other with an air of quiet self-satisfaction , as though it explained everything . " Yes . " For reasons which he could not fathom , Julian was not even surprised . " You are Federigo , " he rather muttered than said , his eyes still on the ground . " Come , keep walking , " the other said . " I think it 's time we had a little talk , you and I , and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must get you cleaned up and present-able . " Julian let himself be escorted , Federigo 's arm linked in his , for some distance , to a paved stone circle in the center of which stood a fountain . The waters fell from a pitcher held aloft by three stone women closely grouped , and splashed into a surrounding trough , on the edge of which they now sat down . The entire area was dimly lit by street lamps placed around the outer edges , and Julian recognized the place asp116one where he had once gone roller-skating , around and around the fountain . He looked down into the waters , which were filthy with shredding cigarette butts , matches , candy wrappers , then at Federigo , who was dipping his handkerchief and wringing it out . " Your intentions , " said Federigo , " have doubtless been of the best all along . But you are , you know , a dreadful innocent . Here , hold still , " and he began washing Julian 's face and throat with the handkerchief . " They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say through the rather rough scrubbing he received . " But you do n't surprise me , you know , I 'm not surprised at all . It is quite surprising that I 'm not , when you come to think of it . " He felt that he was babbling most stupidly , but could not stop . " Did you know that I took your name in vain ? " He giggled . " On a letter , it was , a ridiculous letter , though I do n't know if it was so ridiculous after all , do you see ? " " Please hold still and be quiet , " said Federigo . He continued to scrub Julian 's face vigorously , then rearrangedas neatly as possible his shirt and tie , buttoned up his coat . " A little awkward , " he said , " but not too bad . If people do notice , you can always put on a haughty expression and tell them you 'd rather not discuss the matter . Your haughty expressiondoes really frighten people , you know ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh about it behind your back , they are afraid to say anything to you . Of course , they talk about it among themselves . . . . It 's funny , is n't it , what a great deal of such hocus-pocus goes to making up a character , a personality , something that really , in the world 's eyes , exists ? Pulvis et umbra , darling , and yet  --  there it is , big as life , moving around , putting out pseudopodia in the direction of what it thinks it wants . How dramatic and really entertain/ing it all is ! Which reminds me , my friend , what do you think of your little performance this evening ? " " I was an idiot , " Julian said in a low voice ; he felt as if he were back in grade school , and looked cautiously at Federigo to see if he had answered aright . " Oh , as to that  --  it is not absolutely certain , " said Federigo . " On the one hand , yes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase goes , among eminent educators , statesmenand divines . Operationally , it is hard to deny you 've been a fool ; yet , as I said , your intentions were sound . " " I do n't know what it was I wanted , " Julian said sadly . Federigo , for answer , took Julian 's hand , closed it into a fist , and rapped the knuckles painfully against the stone rim of the basin where they sat . " That 's your trouble , " he said . " You do n't really believe it 's there till it draws blood . Of course you know what you want , only you 're ashamed to say so . You want to know the worst . " Julian considered this statement in silence , looking at the slight cut on the knuckle of his middle finger . " Yes , blood , " said Federigo . " From your own private stock and individual blood bank . You have , I believe , some five quarts of it crawling around in you at approximately a mile an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heat  --  as you might call it  --  of passion . " He smeared his own finger on the cut and daintily licked the blood from it . " Salt as sea water , " he said , " which is very nearly what it is . It has built up that wall of skin and bone and brain which keeps you from being the All . All that a boy is he owes to his mother , it 's a wise child , and so forth . " He laughed , and put his arm around Julian . " Put it another way , " he continued . " Did you ever stop to think , years ago , when you came out here to play  --  you roller-skated right around here a numberp118of times  --  well , did you ever believe you would be here tonight ? " Julian tried to disengage himself from the encircling arm without openly using force , but found it impossible . " You think you know everything , do n't you ? " he sneered childishly . " How could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ? " concurred Federigo , as though this explainedeverything . " And yet , you know , time is not the whole business . How many times , already , do you suppose you have walked over the very place where you will die ? " " This is ridiculous , " Julian said , trying to get up but being heavily restrained by his own feeling of weakness as well as by the arm across his back . " I do n't know you , and I do n't believe I want to . " " Oh , now , I should scarcely say that , " Federigo objected . " Who signed whose name to a letter  --  or two letters ? Besides , I only want to help you to what you want . I 'm not here for my own pleasure , you know . " Look , let us consider it this way , " he continued briskly . " As two men of the world , let us agree on one thing , that whateverit is you want , it is not simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matter a thousand and three little girls . Very likely one little girl is much like another , when it comes to that last dreadful scene on the bed  --  do n't deny it , dear boy , you do think it 's dreadful , I know you do . You are perfectlyaware , are you not , that if it was your ambition to go to bed with this one and that one  --  if it was truly your ambition  --  it could be arranged quite easily , without this fuss over anonymous letters and strangers in the Park ? That little creature , by the way , had clap anyhow , so you are better off than you realize . Or perhaps a touch of clap , a mild dose , is included among your secret desires ? Perhaps that would have pleased your mighty righteousness very nearly as well asp119being beaten about the chops with a flashlight and robbed of your money ? Who knows ? I merely offer the possibility for your consideration . " Oh , dear Julian , I 've known so many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spirit . Perhaps you think you are the only man in the world who has had the idea of sending himself anonymous letters about his wife ? You got the idea you were a pretty wicked lad , did you not ? You were in a real tizzy of fright and delight . And yet the thing is done every day , a hundred times a day , the innocent postman  --  if even he is innocent , which I doubt  --  trudges along with fallen arches precisely from the weight of such communications , the world is full of people spying on themselves in this manner . Their typical weapon is the boomerang , and they almost never remember to duck when it returns ; one suspects they do not even want to duck , it is themselves they have been aiming at right along , and they have tribally adopted the boomerang as their armament because it is the only thing one can hurl at oneself . " " But what does one do instead ? " asked Julian , who had to admit to himself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Instead ? Why , look at it . The world is all before you , perfectly real , it all exists , stones , trees , running water , minutes , hours , bugs , mirrors  --  get out of yourself , and smell the bracing air of reality . That 's what to do instead . " " Now you sound like a scoutmaster , " said Julian . " It all exists , " said Federigo impressively , " and not only that , but  --  may it set your mind at rest  --  nothing else does . " " Nothing ? " " Nothing whatever , a little dust , a little smoke , maybe . When you think that is God watching you , my dear , it is n't . " " Who , then ? "  | " It 's only me from over the sea , said Barnacle Bill the sailor , " sang Federigo , suddenly breaking forth in a loud voice , raucously gay , as he stood up . " Come , let us walk out of the Park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expoundto Julian his curious notions . " It only takes a mite of courage , " he said , " audacity enough to put on the point of a pin . You 've lived a sheltered life , you were educated at the best schools , you know theoreticallythat bad things happen  --  so of course you ca n't believe in happiness , and you 're perfectly correct . Happiness does n't really exist , it is only the absence of everything you are looking for ; you know , reality : filth . But you do n't altogetherwant to find it , do you ? Not that you do n't look hard enough , but that you make sure every time of looking in the wrong place . You are like the man the policeman found searching for his watch under a street lamp . Where did you lose it ? ' asks the policeman . Over there , ' the man replies , pointing out in the darkness , I 'm looking here because the light 's better . ' " Federigo laughed with unnecessary vigor at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Julian rather primly . " Of course , of course , that 's what you always tell yourself , you were in the war . You went out there and killed the enemy , did n't you  --  out there ? But you hated the sergeant , the captain , the people on your own team ? Of course you did ! What did you think the war was trying to say , what does it ever try to say ? Be your age ! " And that brings me to another thing . Age . You 're not dead yet , you know , you have a number of years to stagger through . Well , do n't pride yourself so much on your maturity . For whenever you do , you 'll merely make an ass of yourself , as you did tonight . People do n't really grow up , you know , theyp121merely revolve . When you are mature you will realize it by noticing that somewhere along the steep gradient of moral effort you have died . In short , I advise you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little honest pride in what goes on around you . Do you want love ? Go right ahead , fall in love with the first little girl you meet . What 's so terrible in that ? And even if it were terrible  --  could it be worse than the way you are going on now ? " They had come out of the Park while Federigo was talking , and now stood on a street corner . " We 'll say good night now , " Federigo said . " Do n't resent it if I lecture you , I would n't do it if I did n't think it necessary . There , go ahead , live , be happy , you can do it . And remember , I 'll be around if you want me . " Julian began to say something , but Federigo , squeezing his arm , swung him around facing the other way and sent him off with a coy yet forceful slap on the behind . " Get on with you , " he cried gaily , and Julian heard him laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hugo 's building . When he turned to survey the darkness outside the doorway there was no sign of his recent companion . The stone frame of the entrance , the glass in the door , the bronze handle , all seemed brilliantly real , the lights in the hallway nearly blinded him by their brightness ; he felt like a tired swimmer coming up the beach out of the undertow of the last wave reaching after him . There was a mirror in the elevator . He looked pale and fairly presentable , though there was a patch of blood which could not be concealed on his shirt collar . It was perfectly true , he decided , that Federigo 's eyes were somewhat darker than his own.  |p122THE  party was still going on , in a subdued way ; it had considerably thinned out . The door of the apartment stood open , and Julian crossed the threshold just in time to meet Elaine Leonard coming from the kitchen . She stopped , they looked at one another for a moment , just long enough , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , and for her to realize that he had . The glance between them wavered and changed its character several times during that moment ; all Julian 's free-floating speculation about the secrecy of the world , all his diffused lust , became concentrated upon Elaine 's eyes ; also , all the disgust , for himself and for others , which had been as it were held over from the episode of Bianca and scarcely allowed entrance into his feelings until now . Elaine , not knowing the how or the why of all this , nevertheless felt and responded slightly , tentatively , and with some unease , to the fact of its being so . Just how this happened , how such things ever happen , would not be easy to say . She , coming from the kitchen and carrying two drinks , paused in his path and gave him , in the first place , a look intended to go with what she was about to say , namely that his absence had been noticed , not altogether with pleasure ; she raised her eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or knew of , Federigo , interpretedthis glance as somehow involving them together in a conspiracy of undetermined object . He looked back at her with a gravity in which was also something ironical , and his eyebrows went up , too . She took this as some sort of admission of his being caught , for some reason , red-handed , but with a gaiety attached to it that reckoned informally on her knowing how these thingsp123were ; she noticed at the same time the blood on his shirt , and that his lower lip was somewhat puffed out . This last gave him an expression at once sardonically defiant and indescribablystupid . She replied by the merest hint of a smile  --  that smile so full of crooked honesty intending friendly sympathy touched with sarcasm . This sarcasm , in her , seldom meant hatred or bitterness , but was the expression by which she seemed to understand quite well what she did not in fact understand . " You 've been missed , " she said , with a nod of her head toward the further room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who had missed him . " Oh ? " said Julian , and then , " Is one of those drinks for me ? " Elaine gravely handed him one . " I was  --  just out , " he said . " What happened ? " " I 'm afraid your wife , " she replied , " became , you might say , indisposed . " " Drunk ? " " You might say . " " Oh , dear , " muttered Julian , summoning resolution . " Where is she ? " " Oh , she was taken home a while ago . Marius took her . There was some fuss over where you were while all this was taking place . " " I had a little trouble , " Julian said , " in a bar . " Elaine smiled at him somewhat more broadly , meaning to say again that she understood with a superior sympathy touched to irony by her extensive knowledge of the world and its ways . This smile did not exactly , as the saying is , catch at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves . This girl of nineteen or so ( and she knew Federigo ) seemed to see him with a penetrative innocence , the calm of knowledge in her eyes . He felt sentimentally ashamed of himself , as though hisp124presence at this moment visibly corrupted her , and she standing there like a martyr shot full of feathered arrows , taking it as easily as in an Italian painting . He saw himself now in her eyes as some kind of beast , a beast endowed with reason in order that it might make a fool of itself . Please understand , he wanted to say to her , I am not like this , really . I am unhappy . Of course , he could not say any such thing , and he instead gazed intently at her , as though he could make his eyes speak for him : forgive me , they would have said if they could  --  more like a beast than ever . She however misinterpreted his long look to mean that he pitied her for being a young girl who did not understand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more crookedly satirical and her eyes quite severe , as she said to him : " I do n't mean to mix in your affairs , " with a slight emphasis on the final word . The strictness of her look , the kindness and scorn , both it seemed altogether objective , in her tone of voice , broke Julian down . He wanted to reach out and stroke her hair , thus coming , by a process of varied misinterpretationson both sides , to an expression and glance which Elaine , as she had been fallen in love with before , could quite well understand , as she showed by turning away , after a last smile of conspiratorial kindness which cost her nothing , and walking down the hall to the dimly lit room beyond . Julian stood irresolutely in the narrow hall , and stared into his drink . He ought to go home , and it was the last thing in the world he wanted to do . He did not in the least believe he would discover his wife Sylvia in bed with Marius Rathlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it only because his experience had not equipped him to believe any such thing , and for no more substantial reason . He did not want to go home to a discussion of Marius , a discussion ofp125Sylvia , a discussion above all else , of himself . It was to be presumed , of course , that Sylvia , having been ( " you might say " ) drunk , would be asleep . That made matters , almost , worse , since he would have to wait for morning with the threat of explanations pending ; and he could sense already how dreadful , with a hangover added to everything else , he would feel in the morning . He desperately did not want to be told ( being quite capable of telling himself , a dozen times a minute ) that his behavior had been at least irresponsible , and probably something a good deal worse than that . Some people can do it , he reflected , and others ca n't . Why was that ? And how horribly unfair . Some people doubtless made a habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , no one had noticed , or those who did notice were such as would merely smile to themselves . He left a party  --  once !  --  and the world looked ready to fall on his head . The worst of it was that he blamed himself more than anyone else could  --  though it seemed likely that Sylvia , when she recovered , would at least compete with him in that line . If he should be , for example , drunk  --  in a certain high and authoritative mood which drink at one stage induced  --  he had no doubt of his ability to explain everything , make everything all right . . . simply , of course , by lying , or by ( let us say ) dramatizing . With this in mind he drank off the drink Elaine had given him , and went into the kitchen to get another . But it was impossible , for in the nature of things he would not be drunk at the time of explanation , for just the reason that while he was drunk he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , though , and he supposed he must , sooner or later , the prospect of feeling guilty , the necessity of saying something to Sylvia , extended itself before him . Then again , how in the world was one to explain , even top126oneself , Federigo ? who seemed to Julian far more important , at this moment , than anything else which had happened during that time in the Park  --  not so much a time , it began to appear , as an abscess in time , a darkness , a vivid dream with irrevocable consequences still to be faced in waking . Then there was Elaine Leonard , and for an instant he beheldhis self-contempt reflected from her eyes , his corruption gaining pathos from her purity . The tenderness and abasement he felt swelled in him to a romantic , ardent sadness , and he had a maudlin wish to be nineteen again , with the open world of choice before him . Love , passionate and bitterly exclusive , love for this one girl , he saw , would redeem everything : Bianca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be absorbed into the realm of intense feeling and converted , from casual lust and rage , into honesty again  --  if he loved Elaine . In a flash he saw before him the dreadful scenes , the quarrels , the cold arrangement with lawyers , the divorce court , freedom . . . a vision of Sylvia , who looked more surprised than anything else . But , of course , Elaine must love him in return , or what would all this mean or matter ? " Julian ! " It was Hugo 's voice , loud and somewhat peremptory ; his footsteps could be heard in the hall . " Julian ! " He came round the corner into the kitchen . " There you are , " he said , as though his friend had simply been misplaced , like a collar button . " I want to talk to you , Jay , " he said earnestly . " Let 's fix a drink , and we can talk right here . " Hugo fixed two drinks and handed Julian one , quite disregardingthe fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this would prevent their being interrupted . It was like the final conversation with an alcoholic  - -  -  his friends give him one last round of his favorite drink , sit him down , talk to him seriously and more in sorrow than in anger . . . Hugo sat himself down on the drainboard , Julianp127leaned against the refrigerator facing him . Hugo was quite drunk and in a magisterial mood , nevertheless he seemed somewhat embarrassed to begin . " Understand , " he said after a space of silence , " I do n't know , and I do n't want to know , where you 've been all this time . That 's your business . But the things that happened while you were gone , here in my house  --  ah , Jay , I 'm not going to lecture you , you know that . But you are my oldest and best friend , and I hope I 'm yours  --  and just to prove it 's still so , I want to ask you to be best man at my wedding . Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost inaudibly . " Thank you , " said Hugo with a kind of judicial satisfaction . " Now  --  about this other thing . There 's something wrong between you and Sylvia ? There must be . She 's drinking a great deal . I 've never seen her do that before tonight , Sylvia 's not that kind of girl . But that in itself was n't anything , only  --  if you see what I mean  --  you were n't there just when you were needed . " Oh , dear God , Julian thought with dreadful anticipations . It must have been far worse than anything he had thought . " If she had only got drunk and passed out quietly , you know , " Hugo said , " that would not have been so terrible . We could have put her in a cab with someone , Louisa could have taken her home  --  she could have slept here , for that matter . But she made a fuss , " he said impressively . " She made a fuss , " Julian repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaved rather foolishly about it , I thought , she got all sorts and conditions of people to look for you , it was like a kind of game for a while  --  then , she was quite drunk , you must bear that in mind , she started telling everyone , rather loudly , that you hated her , that you believed she was unfaithful to you butp128that you would n't speak to her and would n't give her a chance to defend herself . Then she got dreadfully angry and went about saying shit ' to people , and so forth , you know how it is when people get , well , intense  --  not very pretty , and she kept on drinking through it all . Then finally she announced to everyone present that she would goddamn well give you something to hate about , and she collapsed on Marius Rathlin  --  more or less all over him . " " And ? " " And he took her home , " Hugo said unhappily . " Oh , I 'm not suggesting there was anything sinister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't there , and  --  and , well , you see how it went . Marius was elected . I 'm afraid , " he added stiffly , " some people tended to make jokes about it . " " Oh , " said Julian . " I do n't mean to put all the blame on you , " Hugo said . " I 'm concerned , that 's all . It 'd look mighty odd for an ancient lecher like myself to take a high moral tone with you , but there 's also manners , discretion , to be considered . I care for you and Sylvia more than any friends I 've got . You may not believe it , because I do n't ordinarily talk about such things , but your marriage has always been a kind of ideal to me  --  the way I hope things will be with Louisa and myself . I know you may have made a mistake , " Hugo said with earnest heartiness . " My God , who does n't , sometime or other ? And you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have n't you ? But if there 's something wrong , Jay , for God 's sake do n't keep it all locked up in there , let me know what it is . I 'll help you out , if I possibly can . But what you need is a man you can talk to  --  I know how that feels . So break down  --  here , let 's fix one more  --  and tell Uncle Hugo what 's gone wrong . " After Hugo had fixed fresh drinks and sat back again onp129the drainboard , Julian in a dramatic silence , because there was nothing else to do , handed him the anonymous letter . Hugo opened the envelope and looked at the sheet of paper long enough to read it a number of times . " I see , " he said to himself . " I see , I see . " He looked decisively up at his friend . " Do you think this is true ? " " I do n't know . " " Well , do you have any idea who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Federigo , Federigo , " Hugo observed . " Kind of a smartaleckyname to pick out . A wise guy . " His voice had become very hard , and he clenched his fist suggestively . " Boy , if I were you , " he said , " I 'd take this kind of thing very seriously , very seriously indeed . There 's nothing more rotten , more cowardly , in the whole world , than a man who wo n't sign his right name to a letter  --  whether it 's true or not , " Hugo added angrily . " No , " Julian dully agreed . " Surely you have some suspicion , some idea ? " asked Hugo . " No , I do n't , " said Julian . " Is this the only one of the things you 've got so far ? " " Yes , the only one . " " There will be more , " Hugo said with satisfaction of a sort . " These people are never content to stop with one . Take it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat smugly , " and sooner or later he 'll give himself away . Listen , Julian , " he added , " let me help you . What you need is professional work . " " Professional ? " " Detectives , boy , detectives . I 'm going to hang on to this letter , " putting it away in his pocket , " and I 'm going to take you and it to some people I know . On Monday , " Hugo added firmly , " we 'll go to these people , Pritchard , Ferriter &; Magoun is the firm name  --  why , I should n't be at all sur/prised they could find out right off who sent this thing . They have methods , you know , science . " I do n't think you should go to all that trouble , " Julian said feebly . " If you 'll just let me have the letter  --  " " Do n't be silly , " Hugo said , " I know you , you 'd put it away and worry yourself sick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old friends made unhappy on account of some wretched son of a bitch somewhere . We 'll get this all straightened away together ; why , if you like , I 'll help you explain to Sylvia . " He winked at Julian . " You got upset , you were worried , you left the party and went to some bar on Third Avenue , you got into a scrape with some drunk and he beat you up a little but you ought to see what happened to him  --  that 's all . " He winked again . " She has to accept that , do n't you see , because after all there is this anonymous letter , and if that does n't account for a husband 's reactions , why , what would ? " Hugo got down off the drainboard and patted Julian on the shoulder . " Go home and sleep , " he said kindly , " your worries are over . Only do n't forget , " he added , " if you get another of these lousy letters , you let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Sylvia 's a bitch to you tomorrow , and you 've got to allow she might be , just tell her it will all be explained in a few days . " Hugo saw Julian out the door . " I do n't mean to throw you out , Jay , " he said , " but probablyyou 've had enough party for one night , and anyhow , this one is nearly over . Remember , " he concluded , " on Monday  --  Pritchard , Ferriter , Magoun . I 'll call you up in the morning . " The apartment was dark , a little glow of moonlight or streetlight touched a corner of the bedroom . Out in the hallp131bathroom the dogs stirred slightly , turning over in sleep . Julian listened for a moment to his wife breathing heavily and evenly in sleep . He undressed in silence , letting his clothes fall on the floor . As his eyes became more accustomed to the dimness he saw that Sylvia was fully dressed and lay on the coverlet . He tenderly pulled off her shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence , also that Marius might have risked so much at least without becoming an adulterer . Sylvia stirred uneasily , emitting a groan or a snore . Julian got into his own bed and stretched out . There they lay , he reflected , in parallel , like figures on a tomb , or like an advertisement for pyjamas , except that neither of them was wearing pyjamas . Those figures on the tomb , where had they come from ? On their wedding trip , he remembered , that was where . In England , in some ancient abbey or other down in the west country . A knight and a lady lay , with grave and sharpened features , in a bronze silence atop their sarcophagus . Sylvia had said something , her hand entwined in his just as the knight 's was with the lady 's . What had she said ? " They must have loved each other well . " " For six or seven centuries , " Julian had replied . Fidelity and death , he now thought . There had been another tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the sculptured emblem more realistically imitated the contents : a skull of bronze , through the empty eye of which a bronze and gleaming serpent crawled ; that was austere , as Julian had remarked with satisfaction at the time , austere and witty . " Witty ? " she had asked , and he had been unable to explain , at least to his bride 's satisfaction , just what it was he had meant . He wondered now whether he would die in this bed , which  |p132rested  , as it seemed , rather uneasily under his weight , and he saw this comfortable contraption suddenly for what it was , a waiting , patient animal . Or else it was a marsh , a mire , and he imagined how one day he would feel himself all at once sinking into its soft , yielding depth , stretching out both hands to the woman , the friends , the doctor  --  faceless , all of them  --  who stared down on him from above and watched him swallowed up . And Sylvia ? Would she die in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged , irrevocably , some long time ago , so that there was now nothing anyone could do about it ? Julian wondered whether he would be afraid to die . Perhaps he would , and he saw at the last instant Sylvia bending above him with a bitter and cruel smile , as though this his being terrified to die  --  were the final secret , the one she would have waited many years , maybe , by that time , to discover and confirm . Or would she be the one , and he the watcher above the bed ? What was beyond ? He considered the God in whom he did not believe , and Who was not therefore , it seemed , in the least prevented from existing , just at this moment . The anger of his conscience , which he could not turn away because it began within him , produced in him a vague , objectless terror , or a terror which had everything for its object , and which he could not escape because it caused everything in the world to reflect himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no solidity anywhere , as in a dream the most trivial object became charged with feelings of despair and fear , while the world began to fall away as in a dream . Sylvia for her part was not asleep . She pretended to he when her husband came home , out of shame and hatred . She felt him pull off her shoes . Thank you so very much , she thought angrily , and wanted  |p133to  giggle . Her head had begun to ache terribly . Perhaps she had been asleep , after all , but now her head ached . If she got up , however , she would have to say something to Julian , which was impossible , so she lay there and added the headache , grain by grain , to everything else which was so hateful . A blessed , drunken amnesia was not quite strong enough to prevent her from feeling ashamed , or from the knowledge that she had put on some sort of exhibition which it would be better not to know much more about ; the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that if she remembered them her head might possibly stop pounding . Marius had been , so far as she could recollect , a perfect gentleman . She did not even think he had tried to kiss her except in the taxi ( which was all right ) . Of course , she must have made a splendidly attractive object to kiss , especially after having ( she thought she remembered ) been sick in the gutter just as they got out of the cab . Her mouth tasted as though she had been sick . Marius , it was to be presumed , then , had gingerly deposited her upon her bed , where she now found herself  --  not in it , mind  --  and he had retired , she supposed , upon such a strict observance of the situation as not even to have removed her shoes , which God knew he might have done . Still , a perfect gentleman . And where had Julian been all this time ? She did not know , and just now she did not much care , either ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was necessary  --  if he had been there , it would not have been necessary for him to be there , because she would not have become drunk , so then he might have gone off wherever he liked . . . That seemed to move in a circle , rather . What was all this about ? About Julian 's having gone off somewhere  --  she merely wanted him to know she did not usually mind ; she wanted him to have a certain freedom at parties and so forth , it was one of the things thatp134kept a marriage going  --  nothing serious , only a certain light freedom  --  kissing other people 's wives , just as their husbandskissed her . But it was inexcusable for him not to be there when whatever it was had happened . That dreadful letter . At this moment , with a blinding headache , she could see it so clearly , on the dining room table , a plain white envelope such as might have been purchased in any one o f a hundred shops . But it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light freedom between husband and wife had to be allowed , these days . She herself used to be so strict about such things , like a girl in an invisible convent . With the thought of an invisible convent the pain in her head gave a fearful jump . But now she was relaxed , easy-going . That was the way , a little give and take . They had , she believed , a modern marriage ; this was , however , the expression people typically used some twenty years ago ; she had not realized that modern marriages could be as demode as all that . What had the letter said ? She could scarcely remember . All that fuss about it in her mind all day long , and now she could remember only that it was signed Federigo , and said something about being alone . It was strange how dreams faded from your mind . It was a plain , white envelope , and it lay on the dining room table , just as clear , as clear , as clear as the dream could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did not appear in the Saturday morning mail ; consequently , so far as Julian and Sylvia were concerned , nothing happened over the weekend . On Saturday they got up very late , not feeling well ; there was not energy enough between them to begin a discussion of the previous night . Instead , they politely and distantly sympathized with one another , and recommendedaspirins at odd intervals when the silence seemed to become unbearably intense . At four o'clock they encouragedthemselves with cocktails until they could eat a light supper ( Julian with a show of domesticity made an omelet ) and went to the movies , then early to bed . On Sunday they read the papers thoughtfully for a long time , got out the car and took themselves and the dogs up into the country ; the trees were a hazy , beginning green , flowers appeared , it began to rain . It did not rain hard , but steadily . They felt chilled and gray , and drove back to town . It was late afternoon , and they went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , still raining , they got sandwiches and beer from a delicatessen , went home , ate , Julian smoked a cigar , Sylvia did as much of the double-crostic in the Times as she could do without effort , and went to bed . Nothing happened . . . . It was terrifying . At every momentit seemed something must snap , but nothing did , neither of them screamed or broke into tears and curses , or suddenlyp138turned on the other with a knife , though each thought of such things constantly . They were both polite , good and , on the whole , kindly persons , who had been taught by their parents and at the best schools not to raise their voices , indulge in tantrums or make scenes ; they were reasonable beings . Moreover , they loved one another . Their belief that they loved one another love , on this view , became a slow-burning unhappiness  --  was the sacrifice imposed upon both of them equally by pride ; even at their worst moments in seven years of marriagethey had never allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seemed to them both an admission of moral failure . The dogs , Troilus and Cressida , slept , were fed , moved gracefully around the apartment , and were silently , as possessions have the habit of being in these circumstances , a reproach , as though to say : How can you be unhappy with two such fine dogs ? The furniture too rebuked them , entering into the spirit of the silence : the clean-lined , slender legs of the low , modern tables , the alert appearance of the couch with its square corners and straight back , the inquisitive curve of a lamp which bent its bell-head heavily from a corner ; all these smart impersonal objects , as coldly reasonable here as they had been in the shops whence they came , all at once achieved the identity of unhappiness : if we thought you would be like this , they seemed to say , we would not have come here . Julian recognized this appearance from distant childhood ; it was the critical look the Christmas presents began to have when one became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they saw were both murder mysteries , portrayinga world of sinister gestures most of them meaningless , sleights of hand to defer the recognition of the really guilty person ; detectives moved in a desert of clues , the camera picked up dramatic contrasts of light and shade everywhere ,  |p139the  characters loved and hated each other by turns on demand of the plot . In both stories the murderer turned out to be the girl who had hired the detective in the first place , and with whom he had been more than half  --  saving only his keen perception of evil in the heart in love . To Julian , the reflexiveidiocy of this arrangement , so fashionable in the detective novel , betrayed as though accidentally some real and intimate source of guilt ; in one of the pictures there were even anonymousletters . He and Sylvia sat in the darkness to witness all these things , occasionally they even held hands , transmitting to one another by slight increases of pressure the most cryptic intimations of feeling . They were like two survivors clutching each other across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent and wide ocean . Three or four times during the weekend occurred the followingexchange . " I love you , " one would say , bestowing a light kiss on the other . " I love you too , darling , " replied the other , with a little caress . These words seemed to sink without resonance or reverberationinto the wide silence . They sat in the living room , where from above the mantel of the empty fireplace Sylvia 's portraitlooked down . It had been done five years before , the painter had made Sylvia extravagantly slender ( it seemed now ) and with a look of wild innocence , in the style of Ophelia  --  in a white gown , clutching blue flowers with flashes of dark red  --  of which the intense poeticism disagreeablysuggested insanity . Julian felt he wanted to tear this work off the wall and fling it on the floor in front of his wife , but was prevented from doing so in the first place because he did not know exactly what he would say after that . That picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and startled expres/sion , covered the room like radar  --  is the most dreadful lie ever perpetrated . Covertly , by brief glances , he compared it with Sylvia , in whose comfortable , handsome body he found no trace of the thin , bitter , erotic ecstasy suggested in the canvas . How could she sit there with that dreadful reproach , that living lie , looking down on her from the past ? Sylvia looked up from the paper . " What is the name of the disciple who doubted that Christ was risen ? " she asked . " Six letters . " Julian did not know , and offered to look it up . " That 's not quite fair , " she said , " but still  --  " " It was Thomas , " he announced after several minutes . " He would n't believe till he put his hand in the wound . " " Of course , " said Sylvia , " doubting Thomas . " This is what life is , Julian thought . We use the Bible to fill out crossword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a puzzle , certainly . He did not believe in God , yet it was quite true that he typically felt someone watching him , just as Federigo had said . Federigo ? Was there any such person ? Had he been there , that night in the Park ? Julian uncomfortably remembered a few vivid details , the arm about his shoulder , the somewhat coy , bantering tone of sympathetic yet mocking amusement , the " boomerang "  --  had any of that taken place ? And Bianca ? He felt a sinking sensation of remorse , as if he were about to be sick to his stomach . It had all happened , it was all perfectly real  --  to the stomach ; only the mind found it vague and unconvincing . Federigo , he said to himself reasonably and in a convincing way , is either real or a hallucination . But here his mind began to boggle , since neither alternative could possibly be found acceptable . If he is real , Julian quickly decided , he must be the Devil.  |p143ter  reason than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that Marius had said something similar about war : " It 's splendid , because you can tell the good guys by the color of their hats . " As for Marius , now , did that young man , he wondered , have a real intention of having an affair with Sylvia ? Julian reminded himself sharply that it was not impossible ; it merely seemed impossible , or , better , very unlikely , because he implicitly tended to take it that Marius saw Sylvia just as objectively as he did himself , and therefore that Marius would not see in Sylvia anything so exclusively attractive , unless  --  which she was not  --  she was to be had for the asking . Then , too , apart from her being , so far as he knew , a chaste and modest person , and still a little frightened of pleasure , there was undeniably the fact that courting Sylvia , especially with any degree of secrecy , would be an expensive proposition , even if it meant no more than buying her occasional meals  --  she liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show  --  and now and then ( Julian supposed ) some little present or other . Of course , Marius might personally require a rather motherly type ; and Sylvia , for that matter , someone who by his youth combined lover and child . This idea abruptly disgustedJulian , who believed accordingly that what he felt was jealousy . He glanced over at his wife , as though she must have followed his thoughts , but she continued imperturbably to bite the eraser of her pencil as she looked at the puzzle . It 's amazing , he thought , what things can go on in the human head , what battles and betrayals , all in utter , lonely security . He closed his eyes and deliberately began to think of Elaine with tenderness and lust ; he discovered sadly that it took deliberation to do so , his mind kept slipping off to other things , her image even at his most intense concentration remained vague except for a rather crude intimation of whatp144her smile was like . They were alone in an unidentifiable room , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile again . . . he pulled the dress down over her arms , the same dress she had been wearing the other night , and then without interruptionhe was thinking of Federigo again , seeing his smile instead of hers . That this should be so provoked him to a slight anger based on the fear that he might be impotent  --  which is ridiculous , he added . But it bothered him , as though it were morally a reproach , that he could not concentrate even upon what he proposed to himself as supremely desirable ; it was so , it seemed , only objectively , and his poor , reasonable mind was like an adult saying to a child , " What do you mean , you wo n't have chocolate ice cream ? You know you love chocolate ice cream . " It is old age , he thought sadly , I 've had my time . Upon this consideration it became to him a point of honor to prove himself upon Elaine  --  upon her body and her spirit  --  because the victory would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely , he reflected , that was natural enough , Sylvia herself must understand that . " I ca n't do any more , I 'm going to bed , " Sylvia remarked , standing up . " I 'll just stay here for a little while , " he replied . " You look sad , " she said . " Is anything wrong ? " " I 'm just thinking , " he said with a certain heaviness . " I thought maybe it was your headache again , " she said , bending over to kiss him . " I love you , " she whispered in his ear . " I love you too , darling , " he whispered back , raising himself up to kiss her softly behind the ear . What went on in the human head , Julian decided , went on also , on a slightly larger scale , in the human apartment . Apartment , that is , where people keep apart ; he had never thought of that before . Privacy  --  what it meant was secrecy ,  |p145hy|pocrisy  . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their possessions  --  and sat in an apartment , where they were as dragons guarding some dread secret which they themselves could not understand . People came to the apartment to visit , they saw the thick carpets , the good furniture , the color scheme , the well-chosen prints and paintings , they moved over to ask mute questions of a row of books on a shelf  --  but all these things told them very little , they never saw the apartment at such times as the dragons sat alone , at such times as the secret itself became more terrible and burdensomethan any threat to it from without the walls could possibly be . It was this , perhaps , which gave him the constant sensation of being watched , assessed , marked in some secret book the idea that somewhere there existed a world which exactly replicated the way in which this world ought to go , and with which this world was steadily , point for point , being compared  --  conscience ( he had read somewhere this clever definition ) was the still , small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But according to Federigo , no such other world  --  and therefore no such voice  --  existed ; or if it seemed to , it was only Federigo himself , or , more strictly , Barnacle Bill from over the sea . Only ? It seemed to him now that his life was a kind of dramatic performance ; all that happened appeared to have a singular quality of being witnessed and made prominent , as though on a stage or a movie screen . The cameras moved quietly , recording everything : Sylvia , in nightgown , moves across left to kitchen for a glass of water ; Julian looks up but says nothing ; she returns , blows kiss , exits up right to bedroom . Julian was tired , and every time he shut his eyes for an instant the world of sleep , that lay so close behind the eyelids , persisted in throwing up to him its cynical and whirling hints ; when he laid back his head against the chair he would at oncep146see ( how strange , to see by shutting the eyes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow , or children who were skeletons in dimity dresses ; and then someone would throw a snowball at him and he would wake suddenly in horrorwith that icy lump imbedded in his brain . I really must go to bed , he thought , and all at once he remembered what he had dreamed the night before . He had been in bed ( a curious place to be , in a dream ) , it was a warm night ( as in fact it was ) so that the covers were thrown back and he lay naked on the sheet ( just so ) . Well , on this sheet crawled a reckonable number , say five or six , very little worms , about the size of nail parings ( large ones ) but dark and corrugated . As Julian watched , their tails , or at least one end of them , they did n't seem to have heads , kind of withered off until detached from the rest , whereupon each tail became another little worm ; this began to happen with considerable rapidity , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time that his body was covered with red spots , which in the dream he sensibly took to be worm-bites . And he woke up . The momentary relief he experiencedat seeing his body quite free from any red spots was soon replaced by a queer , remote depression which had stayed with him right through the day  --  different from , more basic than , his secular depression over marriage and life  --  as though something had gone wrong , either with the dream itself or with its relation to his waking life ; as though , he put it to himself , remembering certain remarks made by Federigo on the subject of clap , as though he might in some obscure way have required those red spots to be really  --  really ?  --  present on his body , for reasons too nefarious to be named . Gets up from chair ; moves away from camera to kitchen ; returns with whisky and soda in glass ; exits up right to bedroom ; camera trucks slowly toward bedroom door.  |p147Stimulated  by her anxiety , Sylvia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which thus gained the status of a recurrent image , a symbol , and would be presented to Dr. Mirabeau for inspection on the morrow . She had carefully copied out what she could remember of the dream : The letter lies on the dining room table ; I try to pick it up , but it seems to be glued down . Anyhow , I know perfectly well what it is . It is from Alma , I say , and suddenlynotice a man sitting across the table from me . It is Federigo  --  I know this although he does not look at all like what I imagined . Instead , he is tall and fair-haired , and smokes a pipe ; he says something about a walk in the Park . I know I must not go with him , and then I feel someone pulling my head back by the hair . Sylvia placed a pencil and pad on the night table before goingto bed , so that it would be convenient for her to receive any further revelation which might be granted . MONDAY morning came ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to follow exactly the same procedurewith the second as with the first . One must go through with what one begins , he thought , and took care , as he read the letter ( with a delicate tremor of the hand ) to make a long face and a small mouth . " What is it ? " Sylvia asked . " It is nothing , " Julian replied again , and presently took the dogs out for their morning walk . Sylvia , who was so convinced of the first letter 's being a dream as to have dreamed of it now twice running , stared at  |p148the  new letter with some consternation ; she saw Julian 's hand tremble , as he made a long face and a small mouth and put down the letter on the table . She did not believe it , even the similarity of the envelope and the paper  --  no one she knew would use notepaper like that  --  failed to convince her , and when her husband departed with the dogs she sat for a couple of minutes without touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one instant ; and at the next , suppose it mentions Marius , then what ? Suppose it says something about Hugo , then what ? what ? SIR - Who is Sylvia , what is she ? etc . FEDERIGOThough she noticed that her hands were trembling , Sylvia felt on the whole relieved ; this was not exactly nothing , but it was nothing in particular . Compared with the first , it was even rather genteel ; in becoming literary Federigo had sacrificedsomewhat of his tone , except perhaps for that sharp , rather sinister " etc . " That all our swains commend her ? It seemed a sweeping statement , and for that reason faintly ridiculous . On a sudden suspicion she rushed over to the bookcaseand spent several minutes hunting for the song , which when she found it proved to contain little enough cause for alarm . " He is literate , this Federigo , " she decided in an access of detective-story vigor , " but not sufficiently so , or surely he would have added the one telling line , Is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hurried ? " But chiefly she thought how , provided with the letter itself , she would triumph over Dr. Mirabeau . " A dream , doctor ?  |p149Are  you quite certain ? Then how do you explain this ? " she would say , producing the document . And she would of course sweep out of the office then and there and for good . But as a precaution , Sylvia , still holding the letter , pinched herself to be sure she was awake . After Mirabeau , she decided , Marius must see this letter ; he might have some idea as to the identity of the writer , and better even than that it would convince him of the existence of a certain romance and danger in their relation  --  which of course must be what the letters were about . If he continued after this to claim that he loved her . . . the idea had its perilous charms . As for Julian , poor thing  --  what did he imagine was going on , what must he imagine ? Still , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things in silence . But would he be silent when he returned this morning ? Or would he say to her , Look here , what about this ? as any honest man ought to do . Or was that what any honest man could be expected to do ? Divorce ? Death ? Horribly extravagant notions had entered her dining room . Surely husbands did not murder wives over such things these days ; even the subtle decor of the apartment spoke out rather sharply against the idea . It now struck Sylvia that Julian 's behavior in this business , beyond being contemptible , was also mysterious . On the one hand he might have confronted her with the letters and demanded an accounting ; on the other hand he might have kept silence , she would in that case never have seen the letters , and gone secretly about preparing whatever action he proposed to take : detectives , perhaps , with divorce or even death somewhere in the background . But he had done neither of these things , and substituted instead something oddly in between : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all ,  |p150there  all communication stopped . Whatever this meant , and she had no idea at this moment , it was deep and subtle . Perhaps , in the case of behavior so deep and subtle as this , Julian himself might be quite uncertain as to where he stood , and , if neither player altogether understood the rules of the game , one might succeed as well as the other . Sylvia , imbued at this moment with the spirit of innumerable detective stories , cached the letter in the drawer of the desk where she kept six months ' receipted bills and all the checks returned from the hank : a messy pile of papers of all descriptions ; it would be like finding one particular leaf in a forest . Julian came in with the dogs , which he unleashed . Sylvia was sifting over a cup of coffee at the dining room table , the newspaper spread out before her . He stood about uncertainly at his end of the table , looking down at the other three or four letters which had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? " Sylvia asked , and waited nervously . Julian looked down at her . " There was another letter here , was n't there ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " Sylvia replied . " I have n't looked at the mail yet . Maybe it got under the paper , though . " And she made a show of looking under the paper , shaking it out , looking around on the floor . " It 's not here , " she said indifferently . " Who was it from ? " " That 's very odd , " said Julian , frowning , and added , " it was n't important , only an old classmate of mine  --  I never really knew him well  --  who is getting married . It took him a long time to make up his mind . " " Who was he ? " " Ah , you did n't know him  --  as I say , we never really got to be friends . " " And who is the girl ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a name I 'd  |p151never  heard before , Jane somebody , I think . You 're sure you have n't seen that letter ? " " Quite sure , " she replied , " anyhow , you know I do n't read your mail , darling . Probably it 'll turn up stuck to the underside of a dish or something . " In a burst of co-operative sympathySylvia lifted three or four plates . " Anyhow , as it 's not important . . . " she said after a moment . " Still , it is extremely strange , " he said , shaking his head . " I mean , I do n't have hallucinations , do I ? And how could such a thing simply disappear ? " " I do n't know why you 're making such a fuss , darling , " Sylvia said , and added , with a slight edge to her voice , " unless you 're implying I have for God knows what reason concealed this trivial document while you were out . " Julian stared at her for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was after all something mean and petulant about his face , she decided , something childish between the eyebrows and in the pouting mouth ; it emerged very clearly when he attempted to be ominous without saying so , like a hard type in a movie . " No , of course not , " he finally said . " Of course not . And anyhow , it is not important . Only strange . " And with the customary casual kiss he left for the office . Sylvia sat for a long time , while the coffee grew cold . She felt she had clearly won a victory , for in some sense he certainly had backed down , but its meaning remained altogether obscure ; what inhe world was the battle about ? It seemed as though they were engaged in some sort of bitter contest in separate sections of a revolving door ; they put out their tongues at one another , and shouted things which the thick glass prevented entirely or made meaningless , and all the time , pushing as hard as they could , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fly out on the street in the end.  |p152The  office was dark , Sylvia could rather feel than see , above and behind her eyes , the edge of a circle of light which , like a magical precaution , surrounded the doctor and his note pad . " Any more anonymous letters ? " Dr. Mirabeau was jovial this morning . But Sylvia had no intention of playing her high cards off first ; she had planned this scene , with dialogue , as carefully as an Elizabethan in a tragedy of revenge . She humbly reported two dreams , the second of which had come to her only that morning in a delicious five minutes of renewed sleep . This second one was very brief : a strange man presented her with a calling card , which was , however , perfectlyblank . " So , so , " said Dr. Mirabeau with satisfaction . " I could have predicted from your behavior last Friday that this image would come up again . Its insistence , by the way , is a very promising sign ; certain resistances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream become more pointed . Glued to the table , you said ? Glued to the table in the first dream and in the second it is a blank calling card ; notice that in both cases you are unable to read any message . " Sylvia noticed . " I still ca n't help feeling , " she said , " that the first one , the one I reported Friday , was real . Its tone "  --  giving the doctor his very own word  --  " was different , somehow . " " Can you think of any reason why that should be so ? " " Only , " she said in a weak voice , " that it was real , after all , and that it started the dreams . " " Ah , Sylvia , " said the doctor calmly , " we 've been over that . No backsliding , now . You can see , ca n't you , how it would be to the advantage of the forces behind the dream to convince you of their reality , to get as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then how do you account for this ? " cried Sylvia in ap153somewhat coarser tone of triumph than she had quite bargainedfor . She sat bolt upright on the edge of the couch and spun the letter to him across the desk . Dr. Mirabeau 's eyebrowswent up , wrinkled , remained up as he drew forth the sheet and studied it , while Sylvia concentrated with fierce humor on the expression of his face , which otherwise , however , did not change in the least for several moments ; then a wise , broad smile began to spread itself out  --  like sunshine on butter , she thought angrily , and wondered what wonderful thing he thought he had discovered now . " Well ? " she asked impatiently . " The letters of which it is composed , " said Dr. Mirabeau imperturbably , " are from Harper 's Bazaar . My wife takes it , I was reading it only yesterday . The paper is right , and here , you see , is an initial S at the head of an article , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazineread chiefly by women , you see , " he observed with satisfaction . " You mean , " inquired Sylvia , " Federigo is really a woman ? " But of course . Why had she not suspected a woman in the first place ? Alma , possibly . To have used a man 's name was the most elementary precaution . " Yes , " Dr. Mirabeau said in a strange , rather priestly tone , as though sorrowing over human frailty and at the same time seeing the sad humor of it . " Yes , a woman . " Sylvia began to recover her confidence in Dr. Mirabeau , who she considered was now demonstrating a plain , manly common sense which had taken her in a moment further along the road to a solution than she had thought it possible to get . She might have noticed , herself , about the slick paper , and herself identified the letters from Harper 's Bazaar , which she read ; and of course she might then have drawn the simple yet inevitable conclusion for herself : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " said Dr. Mirabeau , " if there was a first one , which I still beg leave to doubt . Sylvia , " he said , with deep patience , " I 'm surprised at you , I really am . " Observing her somewhat flabbergasted expression he held up his hand before she could find any words . " Please , " he said authoritatively . " You were tempted , and you fell . Of course . I can understand that , only it is a little late in the therapy  --  I had thought  --  for shenanigans of this sort . Am I a dummy , Sylvia ? Is your physician a little boy , to be fooled ? " " What in the world do you mean ? " she asked with indignationand bewilderment . " Calm , Sylvia . Listen , I will tell you a little story . When Sigmund Freud first announced to the world his discovery that all dreams  --  absolutely all dreams  --  represented a wish fulfillment , this news was not received everywhere with screams of pleasure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to say he was wrong , but even the unconsciousof the patients set to work to denounce his theory . A young lady came to him with a dream in which disgusting but trivial things happened to her . Now , ' she cried triumphantly , tell me if you can what wish is fulfilled in that stupid dream . ' The Master merely looked at her , and he said , Why , dear lady , of course  --  the wish to prove that I am wrong . ' " And in the same way , Sylvia , " he continued over the beginning of any protest on her part , " in exactly the same way . . . You leave here on Friday , you are still a little angry , it seemed so real to you "  --  he imitated in passing her pleading tone , adding a rather disagreeable whine  --  " so : what to do next ? Why , of course ! Give the poor old dummy ap155real anonymous letter . He thinks he knows it all , you 'll show him he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him dreams . And you wrote it yourself . Did n't you ? " He smiled at her to suggesthe was being angry only as a friend , that professionally it was quite all right , was the sort of thing his poor , feeblemindedclientele did to him day in and day out . " That is the most outrageous and absurd thing I 've ever heard in my life , " said Sylvia , standing up . " Do n't imagine for one moment , doctor , that I am going to put up with this course of  --  of  --  nonsense , " she sputtered , " for an instant longer . This is the end . " " Just one moment , Sylvia , " said Dr. Mirabeau in a grave voice . He rang a buzzer on the desk . " Nurse , " he said as the door opened , " Mrs. Ghent has become a little overexcited , it is nothing much , but we want to see that she calms down before she leaves here . " The door closed ; Sylvia heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried . " Sylvia , please try to get yourself under control ; have a cigarette , sit down . You know , " he added , " you make me a little concerned . To try to score off the doctor , that is one thing  --  but to take it in this way , with such vehemence , when you are found out ; that does n't show such a firm grasp on the real nature of things , does it ? You seem to have reached a rather perilous degree of detachment . Tell me , apart from these dreams do you sleep well ? " " As well as I ever have , " declared Sylvia , " but do n't you delude yourself for one instant  --  " " Have headaches ? More than ordinary fatigue ? Eye-strain ? " " Dr. Mirabeau ! Just what are you getting at ? " " I am a little disturbed , as I told you . I may as well men/tion that your friend Alma began behaving in this fashion a few months ago , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be the best thing possible . If we could , as it were , isolate this local disturbance over the letter-dreams , let it have a chance to cool off . . . " He seemed now to be addressing himself rather than Sylvia , who accordinglybecame very frightened . " Please tell me plainly , " she demanded , " what you are trying to say . All this is utter nonsense , as anyone but a psychiatristwould have been convinced long ago  --  " " Ah , it is nonsense , then . " " Not the letters , of course  --  but your ridiculous interpretation . And I will not stand for being detained in a locked room by anyone . Medical ethics , doctor  --  " " Sylvia , if you do not take yourself in hand at once , " he said with asperity , " I shall feel quite convinced that you must have a few weeks of rest and professional care , and as your physician I shall take steps to see you get it . " Sylvia , as much amazed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her laughter became very nearly hysterical . She saw herself going the way Alma went . " There , that 's a good girl , " he said soothingly , " laugh it out or cry it out  --  one 's as good as the other , they 're much the same thing , really . " He came round the corner of the desk , patted her hair and dropped his handkerchief in her lap . She continued to laugh rather wildly for several minutes , choked , wept a little , and dried her face with the handkerchief . This seemed to her the most improbable thing that had ever happened to her , and she wondered whether she would simply be abducted through the back door and placed in an ambulance . Julian might not know for several weeks . . . . " Now , that 's better , " said Dr. Mirabeau . " Maybe now we can talk it over sensibly . Come , tell me , what made you do it ? "  |p157All  right , " Sylvia said , putting on an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something between sullennessand hilarity . " It was silly of me , " she said , " I do n't know what I wanted . " " Well , then , that 's all I wanted to hear , " he said heartily . " No need to apologize to me , you know . " " May I have it back ? " she inquired in a small pathetic voice , stretching out her hand . " Why do n't I simply tear it up here ? " he asked , " and we 'll consider the matter closed . " Sylvia debated whether the letter were close enough to snatch ; it was her sanity he was holding there , and about to tear it up , at that . " I 'd like to keep it , if you do n't mind , " she pleaded . " It will be a reminder to me . " " Very well , " he said , relenting , and gave her the letter . " I see no harm in that . And now , you know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the session today . The time is almostup anyhow . And I feel , in an odd way , that despite everything we have gained ground . " Still , " he added , pressing the buzzer which caused the nurse at once to open the door , " I 'd like you to think over what I said about an ounce of prevention . If you 're feeling some extra pressure these days , why not ? What 's to prevent your taking a few weeks of quiet in the country ? You could join Alma . " " You make it sound positively tempting , " Sylvia said as she left , " we could play gin rummy together . " For weeks and weeks and weeks , " she added when she was far enough down the hall to be out of hearing . The letter had become quite precious all of a sudden , and she clutched it very 1 ight in her gloved hand as she emerged from the darkness of Ur . Mirabeau 's basement office for , as she hoped , the last time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , when she wished to consult him anyhow , and when as a result of what had just happened she needed someone to whom she might unburden herself , Marius might not be waiting for her . She stood on the sidewalk for a few minutes , looking indecisivelyup and down the street . Then she went to the drugstore on the corner and called him up . " My dear , " he said  --  his voice on the telephone was flat and small and brittle  --  " you must realize that with all the gallantry in the world I simply ca n't afford to buy your lunch as often as I would wish , unless we eat at the Automat . Accordingly , I offer you the Automat . " " Nonsense , " Sylvia said impatiently . " I 'll pay for the lunch this time . I want to talk to you . " As it was Monday , many restaurants would be closed ; finallyMarius mentioned one in the Fifties that they could agree on , and there they met . Sylvia , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the meal , showed Marius the letter at once , and gave him a brief history of the situation up to the present time . " I mean , " she said , " I 've never been so frightened in my life , I almost thought my mind was going . " Marius , looking thoughtfully at the letter , heard her story to the end in silence . As he had no interest whatever in detectivestories , no futile deductions from it occurred to him . " How very funny , " was what he said when she had finished . " Yet how very serious , too . " " Well , which is it ? " she angrily demanded . " Funny or serious ? If you 're going to be superior about it  --  " " I do n't see why it should not be both , " he replied . " And why do you get so impatient ? I am at least accepting , to beginwith , your version of the business , and from what you tellp159me that is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly good motives available for your having written it yourself . " " Such as  --  ? " she asked in a dangerously haughty tone . " To be perfectly immodest , " he said , " you might be designingto develop my interest in you by adding this element of peril and romance . There , there , do n't get excited , I do n't reallythink that . But even worse than that , " he added , " would be the plausible idea that it was your husband 's interest you were trying to attract  --  which would mean , once you got him to inquire somewhat into what you do all day , that I would be the first person he would come across . Presuming , that is , that there are not a great many others . . . ? All right , all right , I take that back , " he said hastily . " But , you see , that is what made me so angry at you the other night  --  you did n't tell him we were together during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , God knows , so that when he finally found it out he naturally thought it was not innocent  --  what you keep secret never is , of course  --  and my telling him must have looked liked bald-faced bravado . For a momentthere I thought there might be a small scene  --  I 'll thank you , sir , to keep your hands off my wife , ' is the way I imaginedJulian saying it . And when it developed , later on , that Julian was nowhere about and you devolved , to say the least , a round my neck in the presence of one million witnesses to whom you proclaimed that you were taking off to commit adultery  --  well , almost proclaimed  --  and I had to take you home . . . It is true that I got slightly worried , and it went through my mind that for no particular reason we would find Jay waiting for us in the bedroom with  --  I do n't know what . I kept imagining a crossbow , or some other suitably primitiveweapon such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun , do you ? That 's why I did n't stop even to takep160off your shoes , you know . I kept having the odd feeling that he was standing in the closet , so I fled like Joseph at my earliestconvenience . Sorry . " " Oh , God , " said Sylvia miserably , " was it as terrible as that ? " " It was n't great , " he said . " But never mind . Glad to be of service . And really , I guess , he was not in the closet . " " I 'm sorry , Marius . I had no idea . I wish you had n't told me . " I hope you 're not going to cry in here , Sylvia . They may think it is the food . It is true , though , that embarrassment is the most terrible of the emotions . " " What shall we do ? " she asked him plaintively . " We ? Oh , dear , I might have known this would finish with me in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll pay the man , darling , is to leave here . That is my opinion . " As they walked up the block toward Sixth Avenue they passed a record shop , from the open door of which several sorts of music flared out on the street . " ' Phis is where I live , " Marius said . " Upstairs . Would you like to see it ? " Sylvia recognized a degree of arrangement in all this , beginning with Marius 's proposal of that particular restaurant ; nevertheless , she wanted to be in a quiet place for a few minutes . " Where should this music be ? In th ' air or i ' the earth ' ? " said Marius , giving Sylvia the strong impression that he said this to every girl who climbed these stairs . Indeed , the music  --  only slightly muted , and with some effect of distance  --  seemed to come from no particular source and surround them as they stood in the one bare room where Marius lived . In one corner was a narrow cot covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black desk and chair stood againstp161a wall which was absolutely blank save for the dramatic exceptionof a large crucifix , a cheap one of black wood with a silver figure of the Saviour drooping artistically on it . In one corner , behind a hanging , was a gas stove and small refrigerator ; bathroom and closet completed the arrangements , which struck the girl as beautifully and yet rather pathetically austere . " I 'd expected more books , " she said , looking at the small row at the back of the desk . " Oh , I live in the public library , " he said . " The goodness in poverty is not having to own the damn things . Now , Sylvia , if you feel like going to pieces , the house is yours . " Sylvia sat down on the chair at the desk . She did not exactlyweep , but she bent her head in her gloved hands and bit her lip nervously . Marius stroked her hair softly , standing beside her . It was a scene of tender emotion , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About the letter , " he said , " I do n't know what one does with such things . I could think about it for a bit , if you like . " " What good will thinking do ? " asked Sylvia . " Well , I merely meant that that 's practically all I can do , " he replied . " I am not a detective , you know . " After a moment , he added , " You might simply confront Jay with the thing - here are the letters  --  what is going on ?  --  that 's one way . " " I suppose so , " she said dully , " but I just do n't want to . " " Why not ? " " There would be some sort of dreadful quarrel , " she said . " I 'd hate it , I always hate it when the weakness in people comes out , when they suddenly look like children who are goingto cry . I just hate it . " " Be the best thing , maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you do n't want to have it out ? " " What does that mean ? " she asked  | " Maybe you 'd rather have it come true  --  now the letters have given it a kind of presumptive existence . This Federigo has offered you a suggestion . " " I do n't know , " Sylvia said . " I do n't know what I want . " " You seemed to , the other night when you were drunk , " he insisted . " The idea being that if your husband could believe such a thing about you when it was not true , there 'd be a certaingaiety in making it come true . " " Do n't remind me of the other night , " said Sylvia in a small voice . " It will make me wish I was dead . " " Ah , Sylvia , " he said . " Darling . " He took her hands and drew her to her feet , into a kiss and embrace which lasted awkwardlybetween tenderness and passion until she found they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're a very beautiful girl , " he whispered to her . " I do love you , Sylvia , very much . " She permitted , and co-operated in , a number of caresses which rapidly became more ardent . They sat down together on the bed . A march by John Philip Sousa stood out among the medley of musical sounds below . " No , " she whispered as he began to open her blouse . " No , dear . Not here , not now . " She was staring at the hanging figure of Christ on the other wall ; despite that she was not religious , or perhaps precisely because she was not , she was horrified to think they were desecrating that image . " Why not ? " he urged her , also in a whisper , then , his glance following hers , he saw the crucifix . " Ah , that , " he said brusquely , and going across the room he tore it from the wall and put it in the middle desk drawer , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can you do that ? flow can you dare do it ? " He stood facing her with a kind of defiance at once humorousand pathetic.  | " My dear , " he said , " it is my secret . I am not a Catholic at all . I only wish I were . Please do n't tell this to anyone , Sylvia . " For her part , she could only stare at him . " I 've always wanted to be , " he went on , wringing his hands together . " I think it is the most wonderful thing , I love all of it  --  the tradition , the ceremony , all the splendor and kindness . But I could never bring myself to join the Church . I just , you know , behave as if I were , I observe Lent , I observe all the feasts , I meditate on the Seven Deadly Sins , the Seven Sacraments , the Seven Penitential Psalms , the Four Last Things , I think constantly of Christ dying on the Cross  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked incredulously . " I did , to learn the rituals , " Marius confessed . " I still do , now and then . " " But no confession ? No communion ? " " I could n't , " he said . " As St. Augustine tells us , it would be taking hell fire in my mouth . " " Oh , dear , " said Sylvia very abruptly . Marius sat down beside her again . " You see , I do n't believe in God , " he explained , putting his arm around her again . But it was no good ; he felt vulnerable and victimized , even though extremely tender toward the girl who had received his dreadful secret ; while as for Sylvia , she had begun to giggle uncontrollably , she had never been so confusedin all her life . JULIAN 'S conspiracy against the world began to frighten him by the power it had , being itself in its inception unreal , of evoking perfectly real events in its wake . He felt bitterlyp164ashamed of himself for his demeanor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done ? It was impossible for the letter simply to have disappeared in the brief time he was out , yet it was impossible too  --  for him  --  to say directly to his wife , What have you done with that letter ? Secrecy condemnedhim to silence , silence to a world in which , it seemed , no objective evidence of anything existed  --  could he be absolutelycertain he had written and mailed the second letter ? He remembered his doubts about doing it , his determination to do it , remembered that he had sat right here at his desk and done it  --  but he could not achieve , try as he might , any convincing image of his having done it . Possible , after all , that he had dreamed the whole business ? No , it was not possible . There was , in the first place , the first letter ; he clearly had not dreamed that . He reached thoughtfully into his pocket , which was empty , and recalled in dismay that he no longer had the first letter either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call in a company of private detectives . But that too , if all had been a dream , could have been part of the dream . Julian did not think it likely , but he had , just now , sitting like a hermit in the midst of the vast silence , no way of demonstrating the reality of these events , of Bianca , of Federigo , of the letters . His face , of course , was still a bit bruised , though the swelling of his lip had gone down . There was the cut on his throat , but that originally happened while shaving , did it not ? The morning mail , when Miss Duddon brought it to him , included a small package which turned out to contain his wallet ; there was , of course , no return address . The world , that greater anonymity , had spoken . Julian was relieved at the return of the wallet , which cut down on the likelihood of his being blackmailed by those people , and he was strangely charmed by the tact and courtesy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card , the office rather than the home ; feebly , he even felt grateful to Bianca ; the gesture savored , very faintly it is true , of Robin Hood . At the same time , it meant that everything was real , the existence of this objective communication from the outside inspiredconviction also about the letters ; it all must have happened . Then the detectives too would be real . How terrible ! One consequence produced another . Could they find out anything ? It seemed doubtful , unless , as he suddenly realized , they would include him among the suspects merely as a matter of course . They could check on the office typewriter . But how foolish to think they would suspect him , Julian , the husband , recipient of the letters , and the very person , in the first place , who hired the detectives . And yet , he dismally acknowledged , this was exactly what happened in the movies , where it seemed that the criminal 's first action after committing his crime was invariably to hire a private eye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did things really happen that way ? Were people really so filled with guilt as to make such a thing Likely  --  in real life ? But real life , as it was called , continuallyimitated art , so that if the detectives of twenty years ago , say , would not have suspected the husband , these detectives  --  having been , of course , subjected to the movies  --  would certainlysuspect the husband . And Federigo had told him that for a man to send himself anonymous letters , far from being so extraordinary as to be considered unique , happened with incredible frequency and was perhaps not even unusual . Federigo ? There was another problem . Problems were everywhere . In all this , Elaine proved to be the only agreeable thing to be thought about . Julian called up Elaine . Louisa answered the phone , and he spoke to her in a deeper voice than usual ,  |p166not  quite a disguise , in case she recognized him anyhow , but not quite not a disguise either . " This is Julian Ghent , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd like to talk to you , if I might  --  about our conversationthe other night , " he added . " Yes , go on . " " I mean  --  if we might get together somewhere ? " " Oh . I see . " Her voice was doubtful ; a silence followed . Then she said , " I 'm very busy . " " It 's rather important , " Julian said . " How about this aft-ernoon ? " " Oh , I could n't . I work in the Museum of Art in the afternoons . I paint , " she explained . " You paint , " repeated Julian , somewhat put out by the introduction of this new element . " Well , might I come round to the Museum , maybe just before closing time  --  take you for a drink ? " After another silence , Elaine said , " You might . " " The Metropolitan ? " " Yes . " " Where will I find you ? " " I do n't know , exactly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around among the paintings . Do n't come early , Miss Desmonddoes n't like us to be interrupted . " " Miss Desmond ? " " The teacher . " " Oh . I see . " All in all , it was not a very warm or satisfying conversation . And what , actually , did he want to say to the girl when he got there ? I love you ? It did not seem likely . To put these thoughts aside for a time , Julian concentrated with great determination , during the rest of the morning , on Dr. Thybold 's campaign to rid the world of tobacco . That didp167not seem likely either , but he managed to devise what amounted to a threatening letter in the name of modern medicine , addressed to " intelligent men and women everywhere , " and especially to parents . " Would you , " it began , " deliberatelyinoculate your child with cancer of the lungs ? " Julian fancied there might be a small picture for a letterhead , showinga naked babe on an operating table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand  --  poised with the needle aimed at the child 's breast . When he had done this , not giving himself time to think of anything else , he drew the Bible to him and began to consider the campaign of Mr. Archer More . I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD , he wrote in block letters across the top of his pad , then spent half an hour searching for the source of this expression , without success . He would have to ask Miss Duddon , or have her look it up in a concordance at the library . Let it go for the present . With the Bible beside him , Julian began to compose a passageof several paragraphs on the state of the world . He depictedchildren dying everywhere ( not of lung cancer )  --  some by bombs , some of famine , some on the bayonets of savagetroops . It was quite hard , he found , to bring these scenes of carnage into a right relation with Faith ; for he felt , personally , that exactly the same thing would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and filled the churches to overflowing at all hours of the day . But on the other hand , the somewhat swollen style demanded by this work  --  " the I-say-unto-you kind of thing , " as he privately named it  --  came very easily to his pencil , only that it induceda certain self-hatred . I must try to imagine , he told himself , what it would be like to he Archer More . His mind quailed before this idea . The whole business , Julian began to believe , Thybold ,  |p168More  , the art of advertising itself , the entire world of demand and satisfaction , buying and selling , consisted to a dangerous degree in the production and communication of anonymous or pseudonymous letters . He took up the first magazine that came to hand and looked at the advertisements . Page after page , all the same . Everywhere people were speaking blandishmentsand threats , appealing with bitter persistence and ferocity to fear , shame , desire , guilt , despair  --  and always under a pseudonym which gave authority : in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness , the name of love , the name of honor and the name of freedom from underarmperspiration . All this was deemed to be perfectly honorable , also necessary ; if it did not go on , the wheels would stop turning . If the wheels stopped turning , then what ? Julian did not know what . He imagined the stopping of the wheels , the generators , dynamos , locomotives , the taxis in the streets below ; there followed a confused vision of the gleam of metal fading , rust on a window frame , the huge city and the social fact filled with the sight of a soft wind , and silence , silence , silence . As for myself , he thought , I have written two anonymous letters , two . In them I did not speak as though I were God or the Government of the United States , I did not pretend to be Health or Morality or Industry or Labor or Management or Science or Fear of Death or Love or Conscience or any of those fine and wonderful things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happening to me . Hugo did not forget , he came to the office himself during the afternoon and dragged Julian by main moral force to the officesof Pritchard , Ferriter &; Magoun . " I do n't want you to forget it , " he said over his friend 's protest . " I personally , as your friend , want to see this thingp169cleared up as much as you do . Or as much as you ought to do . " The detective firm was not far away , on the fifty-fourth floor of a skyscraper . " This is n't the original Pritchard Ferriter Magoun , " Hugo explained as they went up in the elevator . " These young fellowsbought the name and the good will  --  the mailing list , you know . When they came out of the Army , it was . It 's Mr. Bilsiter I want you to talk to , he 's a good sort of man , he 'll know what to do . " Mr. Bilsiter , whose first name turned out to be Chauncey , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also a graceful wave to it  --  with an egg-shaped face in which huge eyes carried out the egg-motif ; there was also a very lofty forehead with some sort of eczema on it . He was on the phone when they were shown into his office . " But darling , " he was saying , " she knows already , that 's exactly what I 'm trying to tell you , she knows , and what 's more she tore up the prints and laughed in his face and said he could show the negative to whoever he damn pleased . If I were you , Fred , I 'd drop the whole thing right away  --  tell him we do n't do business with people like that . There might he violence , anything can happen with that woman . I 've met her , darling , I know . " Mr. Bilsiter replaced the phone very decisively . " Hugo ! " he cried . " How nice of you to stop in . You have n't had any trouble , have you ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " My business has gone along fine , thanks . The decree is being granted this week . Your people did splendidly , " he added , with some pompous embarrassment . He then presented Julian , stated succinctly what their business was , and handed Mr. Bilsiter the first letter from Federigo . Julian felt hypnotized , he thought this could hardly be happening to him . At the same time , he was a little less ter/rifled than he had been , for Mr. Bilsiter did not look as though he could detect eggs at Easter . He was now staring owlishly at the letter through a magnifying glass . " You poor thing , how disagreeable for you , " he said to Julian . " Do you know this person Federigo , I mean do you know anyone of that name ? " " No , " said Julian . " Heard the name anywhere  --  read it in the papers , maybe ? " " No . " " Hmm . Foreign name , eh ? Italian . " " I noticed that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has mentioned such a name in your presence recently ? " " No . " " I ask , " said Mr. Bilsiter , " because in these matters , where a person does n't use his right name , it almost invariably happensthat he gives himself away by being clever , he uses a name which bears some allusion to his experience , to what he is doing  --  he does n't simply lift one out of the phone book , which would be the sensible way . " " Really , " said Julian , " it 's not very important , and I do n't suppose you can do much on the one letter . I do n't like to take up your time  --  " " You 've received only the one letter ? " " No , " said Julian , before he had time to think . Now I 've put my foot in it , was what he did think when he got there . Hugo and Mr. Bilsiter were looking at him keenly . " One came this morning , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added miserably . " At least I could n't find it anywhere . " He explained how he walked the dogs in the morning , and thought as he went along what a ridiculous figure he must be making himself out to be.  |p171So   --  Sylvia knows , does she ? " said Hugo . " What did she say ? " Julian was forced to recount that disgraceful little scene as well . " I 'm afraid , " said Mr. Bilsiter , " to be perfectly plain about it , sir , I am afraid you are growing a pair of horns . Or why would she deny it ? " Hugo hastily got up . " I do n't think I need to hear this , Jay , " he said kindly . " You can count on Chauncey to help you see it through . I 'll call you up to hear about how things are going along . " He patted Julian 's shoulder with funereal sympathy and took his leave . " As I see it , " Mr. Bilsiter said when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves do n't give us much to work on unless , of course , you get more of them . Oh , we 'll check what little we can , but if you 've no connection whatever with anyone called Federigo  --  if the name rings no bell in your mind  --  we 're fairly stuck , you see , to begin with . We must play a waiting game , " he said sagely . " On the other hand , " he went on , " what we can certainly do is pin down the contents of the letters , establish the truth of the accusation they makeI 'm afraid I have no doubt at all it is quite true  --  and collectthe evidence , names , dates , places . . . . " " Evidence ? " asked Julian stupidly . " For the divorce , " Mr. Bilsiter explained . " You wo n't , I should think , have much trouble at all , it looks like being a perfectly clear case , perfectly lovely . The one thing I do n't like , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She may lay low for a while , not see the man . " He frowned , then said in a brighter tone , " But they seldom do , you know . In my experience it usually turns out they somehowrefuse to acknowledge that someone knows , they ca n't re/sist seeing each other just once more and then once more  --  and so it goes , as if they were invisible . You know , just the way people who pick their noses in public always think no one has seen them . " " But really , " Julian found space to protest , " I do n't want a divorce , I  --  " " What you do with the evidence , " Mr. Bilsiter said , " is naturallyyour own business . You may be the old-fashioned sort , I do n't know . I do n't want to know . We collect the evidence , and there our responsibility ends . We do divorce work , Mr. Ghent , we are not toughs or thugs in this firm . In plain English , i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that matter , yourself , kindly do n't tell me about it . " When Julian left the office of Pritchard , Ferriter &; Magoun he had rented the services of a private detective , who was to report to him upon his wife 's actions daily for as long as was necessary , these reports to be made by mail to Julian 's home . All this Julian did , or allowed to be done , not only because it was too late to turn down Mr. Bilsiter  --  it seemed as though that would be an open admission that Julian himself had guilty knowledge of the letters ( which Hugo would of course get to know at once )  --  but also because he had become somewhatbemused and spellbound by the idea . He saw himself sittingat breakfast , over the coffee , reading about Sylvia while she unsuspectingly sat opposite . Perhaps there 's something in it , after all , he thought as he left the office . It will do no harm to find out , just as a point of academic interest , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little I know of her life  --  or of her , for that matter . What does she think ? What does she think about me ? That is somethingno detective report can tell me , of course . Still , it is interestingsimply to let things happen as they will . And of course I do n't need to do anything with what I find out ;  |p173unless  , that is , the whole awful dream turns out to be quite true . . . . " You certainly have started something now , " said Federigo , who was walking along beside him . " Detectives and all . Probablybloodhounds next . It 's a long boomerang that has no turning . " " I should think I 've got enough troubles without you , " Juliannearly snarled , as they walked uptown . " Without me , my dear friend , " said Federigo , " you would n't have the troubles . Without me , " he added , " you 'd be dead . Here , let 's walk up through the Park . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , ' " blithely said Federigo . " Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . And when he thought thereon , he wept . ' Very beautiful , that , and so mysterious , do n't you think ? And when he thought thereon , he wept . ' Julian , when are you going to weep ? " Julian maintained an angry silence . " You believe , " said Federigo , " that eyes are made for seeing , but I tell you  --  I say unto you , to give it the proper tone  --  I say unto you that eyes are made for weeping with . " They walked through the Zoo , Federigo chatting all the while . " Tell me , " Julian said at last , " what must I do to make you leave me alone ? Do you want me to apologize for using your name ? I 'll do it , I 'll swear never to think of you in the future , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " To make me leave you alone , " said Federigo , " you must be other than you are . " They walked , after this , up past the pond where children sailed boats , or at least where they had done so when Julian was young . As Federigo pointed out , however , there was nowp174but one vessel in this entire water , its progress followed by two or three elderly men ; it was a miniature submarine . " It would solve all your problems , would n't it , " Federigo then observed , " if she simply died this week . A natural death , of course . " " Shut up , shut up , " cried Julian in a childishly savage voice . " Keep your despicable thoughts to yourself . " " Oh , it had n't occurred to you ? I thought it had . Beg pardon , " said Federigo mildly . " Just an idea , " he went on , " just an idea . I was thinking chiefly of your freedom , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your detectives will find out . Will they realize how utterly strange it is for a man to get such letters and then allow his wife to see them , and even to keep one ? If they think of that , dear , I should n't be surprised if it was all up with you  --  honor , morality , honesty , the whole works : pouf ! And all for what ? You have n't even been unfaithful . Ha ha , that started the whole silly treadmillrevolving , and here you are , just what you were before , only a few days older . Except in thought , that is . And I say unto you again , whoso looketh after a woman to commit adultery with her , why , he might just as well go right ahead , is n't that so ? " Federigo chuckled disagreeably , and pointed ahead up the path . " There is the Museum of Art , " he said . " School 's out for today , my friend . Run along to the great masterpieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " Stop ! Wait ! " cried Julian . " I thought you wanted to get rid of me , " Federigo called back over his shoulder ; he ran down a small side path and through a tunnel , where Julian followed . On emerging and looking everywhere around he caught no sight of Federigo , but felt , nevertheless , as though that gentleman continued to watch him from a place of hiding.  |p175T  WAS characteristic of Julian , as a morally minded person , to view the world more or less entirely in terms of his own decisions ; he implicitly believed that once he had made up his mind to be unfaithful , and had gone so far as to find the right girl to be unfaithful with , and even fall prospectively in love with this girl , she would at once fall into his arms , the way ahead would become clear , there would be easy sailing , et cetera . Things did not of course turn out in exactly this way ; he found he had underestimated rather grossly the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , money and attention , all of which had to be provided without disturbance , at least in appearance , to the normal distributionof his time , money and attention . As to time : he was fascinated , his entire sensibility was heightened ; instead of a dull succession of moments along which he traveled like a bead on a thread , he began to see time as a house , an immense closed space of many mansions ( like the Museum , in a way ) with secret passages , hidingplaces , alcoves , false partitions behind which whole rooms could be concealed without disturbance to the apparent dimensionsas seen from outside . If one shaved fifteen minutes off here and ten there and another ten over here , if moreover one were then twenty minutes late getting home , there was very nearly a whole hour which seemed scarcely to belong to time , which afforded a delightful , cozy , though temporaryp176shelter from the inexorable public succession of moments registeredon clocks everywhere around it . In fancy he compared it with that model of an Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum , he first kissed Elaine ; a brightly lit space with cold , smooth , pinkish walls and a sign which said : TOMB OF PER NEB " False door " through which it was believed that the deceased entered into the bliss of the other-world . In order to secure this corner in time , Julian began to take taxis uptown , leaving the office twenty minutes early and savingalso the half hour or so it would have taken to walk . This cost money , and money was more inexorable than time ; time , being manufactured , as it were , out of waste materials , out of moments which separately would have meant nothing and been useless but could be thus assembled into a spare hour , need not be regarded as literally being taken from Sylvia and given to Elaine ; with money it was otherwise . They had , too , he and Sylvia , a joint checking account  --  which they could not be said to have , really , as regarded time  --  and any inordinate withdrawals on his part would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to spend very little on Elaine , transferring in this manner the guilt of his conduct from the moral to the financial realm ; but guilt it remained , slice it how he might , with the result that now and then , in an access of disgust and contempt for himself , he would spend a great deal of money on her all of a sudden ; which he would then regret . As a solution to both problems at once , of time and money , he devised a series of dentist 's appointments  --  for it was quite true that his teeth needed attention  --  which out of consideration for his work he placed in the late afternoon , so that he could leave the office at four andp177attribute all extra expense to the dentist , whom he would claim to be paying in cash ( he even went so far as to invent a personalityfor this dentist , to make him the sort of man who would have to be paid in cash , in case an explanation should become necessary ) . Then even this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite disturbing reason that he was spending money on Elaine which ought properly to go to the care of his teeth : images of death and slow decay  --  " I am killing myself for love "  --  gave a secret poignancy to his love , the more because their source was too silly to be mentionedor even coherently thought about . Attention , however , or , more properly , the quantity of love or of feeling generally , disturbed him in quite another way ; it did not at all appear to diminish by division as money did and as time would if he spent more of it with Elaine . On the contrary he came from a meeting with Elaine buoyed up and filled with affection , of which Sylvia received the benefit ; Julianwas more charming with her , more interested in her , and took her out to dinner more , than he had done for months . He recognized his feeling as in part a kind of obscure gratitude to his wife for not noticing anything , or appearing not to notice anything , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took the form of an increased tenderness and demonstrativepleasure in her company ; even in bed , where Julian desperately thought of Elaine at all instants  --  and thought with terrible remorse that it was she whom he betrayed  --  it was , after all , Sylvia who received his passionate and treacherousardor as sheer advantage . Julian during this time had moments of the most intense wretchedness , but they alternated with moments of great charm- not necessarily , either , the ones spent with Elaine , but chiefly perhaps the moments of imagination ; at least life becameless dull . He thought longingly about the enchantment ofp178a polygamous society ; how easy and delightful it all would be . When he read in the newspapers some story of a man 's having successfully led a double life for some years undetected , with two wives in the same town , he was extremely pleased at what he took to be a demonstration : neither woman dissatisfied , each with her own home and her own life and her own husband , and the man doubtless charmed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied what Julian considered to be the basic , neglected element in the male character , the need to be at least two persons ; as he named it , the dramatic need . One such story in particular fascinated him . A young man in a Southern city had managed for over a year to be the husbandsimultaneously not merely of two but of three women  --  but that is a little too much , thought Julian , imagine the financialarrangements and the struggle to keep those identities fully separate . This situation , however , had a quite amusing finish ; the young man finally was caught out over something trivial : he refused to take wife number three to the same doublefeature he had been forced to see with numbers one and two ; the third wife was suspicious , in the first place , for no betterreason than that she had wanted particularly to see this bill at the neighborhood theater , she began to think , she asked questions , she set on detectives , and the husband was caught . Before being put away by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the tone of the newspaperaccount , was laughing enviously up its sleeve ) this extraordinaryman admitted to being somewhat bored with the whole business , and glad it was over . So affection seemed to expand , with Julian , as required , it rose to its occasions ; the more love he needed the more he had . Somberly he recognized , however , that this happy state sufficed only for the beginning of the program ; for just sop179long as love remained spiritual in fact , whatever it might be in intent , no wickedness appeared on the surface . But beneath the surface there waited , quite plainly , the brute sexual fact , where the principle of division obtained exactly as it did with money ; shameful as it was to acknowledge , love 's incarnation was corrupt while love 's spirit was not ; what was given to one woman in bed could not be given to another , nor was there here any way , such as an appointment with a dentist who did not exist , of fictitiously extending , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not , at this time , very much , for the good reason that he could not by any means be certain or even very confident of Elaine 's soon becoming his mistress ; that existed , if it did exist , at some remote crossroads not quite to be located in ordinary time , and as for the moment he felt borne along on a wave of precarious happiness he did not requirehimself to think very rigorously about the approaching time of decision . On the day he first met Elaine in the Museum Julian had walked meditatively and slowly through the galleries ; he wished to come upon her , if he did , as though by accident , for he was still full of the sensation of being watched , and even had the faint , absurd suspicion that the eyes of the portraits , which seemed to follow him along , had been slit open to admitin their places the eyes of Federigo . He found Elaine seated before a huge canvas by Titian containingamong other figures a billowy , naked courtesan the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very well , on her easel . He stood behind the girl for a few minutes in thought and a certain dismay ; that she should paint was a sufficientlyjarring note , somehow , and that she did it badly was almost intolerable ; moreover , in flat heels and a smock she looked like a dreadful little schoolgirl . He very nearly dropped the whole affair at this time , but one thing alone keptp180him there , and this was the tenuous certainty , something in the straightness of her back , some highly accented concentration on what she was doing , that she was quite aware of his presence behind her . Julian came closer and stood there in a critical posture , his head to one side and hands behind his back . The girl turned slightly . " There you are , " she said . " I 'm nearly through . Terrible , is n't it ? " she indicated her canvas . " It is a little , well , lumpy , " Julian said , comparing it with the original and noticing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint on one cheek . " Mother likes me to do it , " Elaine said . " Perhaps she believesit will keep me off the streets . I do n't mind , really , though . Oh , Miss Desmond , " she said with an air of pleased surprise , " this is Mr. Ghent . " Julian saw a fierce-looking old lady , very small , in oatmeal tweed and thick woolen stockings , who put one hand on the cameo at her breast and sighed flutteringly . " That 's all right , then , " she said . " It is so hard to keep peoplefrom annoying the girls during the session  --  this place , you know , is a veritable wolf-haunt , ideal for pick-ups . You know one another , then . That 's all right . But I must insist , " she went on while shaking hands with Julian , " that you do not disturb Elaine during the hour , I will not have it . Do you paint , Mr. Ghent ? " Miss Desmond began edging him slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't , " Julian politely replied . " Not at all ? " Miss Desmond asked . " Not even a little bit ? " She coyly held up finger and thumb close together , as though to show in how slight a degree it would be possible for Julian to paint . " Not even that much , " he said , and drew Miss Desmond further aside to say in a low voice , " I am sorry to interrupt inp181this way , but there is something important I must say to Elaine . She is my cousin , you know , " he added . " Not bad news , I hope ? " Miss Desmond asked . " If you must , then , Elaine , " she called , " you had better put away your materials and go with your cousin . But remember , " she said severely to Julian , " this is an exception . It must not , must not become the rule . " " Why cousin ? " Elaine asked after they had got away . Julianlaughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Elaine had co-operated passively at least , pleased him a good deal . " Why not ? " he asked lightly , taking her arm as they left the Museum . He led her to a bar nearby  --  there was not much choice in this neighborhood , and it was a disagreeably domestic and ordinary bar  --  but the waiter would not serve Elaine because she was too young . This amused Julian and accordingly annoyed her . They got into a cab and went downtownto a place on Third Avenue called the Delta Cafe , where there was not enough light in the booths for the waiter to make out Elaine 's age , and where in any case he would not greatly have cared . " I hope you solved your little difficulties the other night , " said Elaine . " Ah , " said Julian neutrally , indicating either that he had , or that no solution was possible and that , in any case , the whole matter was beyond discussion . " I think you 've a lovely wife , " Elaine then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A perfectly beautiful girl . I wish I looked like that , " she said simply . " Yes , " Julian said . " But Sylvia 's not entirely well . She goes to a psychiatrist , you know . " " Oh ? " " This is a rather difficult time , " he added , " I do n't know if  |p182we  will stay together , Sylvia and I. " It was the first time Julianhad phrased this idea aloud , and he felt ashamed of it . But there was also a kind of pleasure in this shame , and he thought that now he had begun to betray his wife he would go on to the end , probably a bitter end . " I 'd rather not talk about it just now , " he said . " Why did you call me today ? " she wanted to know . " Because I felt lonely , " he replied . " I wanted someone I could talk with . " " And you suddenly decided on me ? " " I 've thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I like the way you smile . " They looked at one another . In the semi-darkness of this place the slightest glance gained a conspiratorial character ; they were like two spies , full of suspicion , inquiring for a password . They looked into one another 's eyes , saying nothing but what could be said for them by their eyes which were either windows of the soul or mirrors on the world . Julian 's glance intended earnestly what he would not say , and hers inquiredinto its sincerity with a like earnestness in which there was , however , some amusement . The brief dialogue of these eyes ran something like this : ELAINE : This is very nice , and even exciting . There are reservations , of course . JULIAN : I do mean it . I know exactly what I am doing , and I know it is wicked . ELAINE : I am free to do as I like . You , on the other hand  --  JULIAN : I ca n't help myself , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may please and I may not , but thank you . " I hope we can be good friends , " Julian said , and took her hand . " May I see you often ? "  | " I 'm sure we 'll be good friends , " she said , gently disengagingher hand . They continued to meet at the Museum . Julian would arrive I()ward the end of Elaine 's painting session , and hang about evading so far as possible the eye of Miss Desmond ; then Elaine would put away her equipment , Julian following at some distance , and they would meet almost as though by accidentin some quarter of the building where Miss Desmond had no business ; among the medieval armor , in the Egyptian collectionor far away where the Chinese jade and pottery lived . In this way Julian came to see his friend against a number of exotic and diverse backgrounds , and this effect of variety did not at all diminish her charm for him . He was very happy at this time , though also somewhat apprehensive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious double feeling about this ; there was , first , the odd self-consciousness whereby he knew at every instant that he was being watched , spied upon . At certainmoments he had the penetrative knowledge that he himself was doing the watching , that he stood back in a corner of the gallery , slightly shielded by statue or glass case , and saw himself over some little distance taking Elaine 's arm , walking with her , heard himself talking to this girl ( his voice sounded very odd ) ; at these moments he watched with cynical doubt and a sneer how their heads came close together as they looked at one or another exhibit  --  came together and casually , whisperingly , drew apart again without a smile , without a glance , with no acknowledgment of what they both knew . On the other hand he was possessed by a supreme and unfoundedconfidence in either his discretion or his luck ; for the very reason that he felt himself constantly observed by the critical eyes of his own guilt , he did not really believe it wasp184possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told himself that his friends were really not the sort to be found dead in any museum but the Modern Art . Then , too , there was recklessness ; supposing anyone should see , what of it ? When , one rainy day about a week after their first meeting , Julian and Elaine entered the Egyptian tomb with the pinkish walls and found it empty and perfectly screened from observation , they were both quite aware of what was going to happen ; each was quite aware , also , of the other 's awareness , and yet perhaps not altogether certain , so that there existed a fine tension between them as they turned toward one another in the clean , empty tomb which the Museum authorities had illuminatedvery brightly perhaps against just such a contingency . Elaine kissed him with amateurish and experimental ferocity , fastening her teeth on his lower lip ; it was , for Julian , an uncomfortable business , which he felt she probably considered highly erotic from having read about it in a novel . Nevertheless , it was a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happiness . After a moment in which they clung together she let him go , pushing him a little away , and stood back as far as the space of the tomb allowed . She laughed , beginning with that out-ofkiltersmile which he found so terribly appealing . " My dear , " she said , " this is not a good thing for us to be doing . " " You are absolutely lovely as an Egyptian , " Julian said . But of course this kiss , this moment of clarity which divided so exquisitely the past from the future , entailed as a consequencelong discussions ; they were two civilized people , yes , that was agreed , but what exactly did being civilized include in such a situation as theirs ? Julian said at one point  --  they had left the tomb and were strolling aimlessly around the mon/uments of Egypt , hand in hand  --  that they must be absolutelyhonest . " We must know what we are doing , " he said , and Elaine nodded gravely . They knew what they were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circuit of the hall , they found themselves again before the tomb , whereat they smiled at one another  --  " well , once more , " whispered Elaine  --  and went in . They were unaware that at this time , and again as they emerged a few moments after , they were observed by Marius Rathlin , who was enraged at the sight of them . It would not have been extraordinary for Marius to visit the Museum at any time in the course of his studies , but as a matter of fact he had come there because Elaine 's mother told him on the phone that Elaine was to be found in the Museum . From some little distance , just as he had caught sight of the girl and been about to speak to her , he saw Julian come up and take her arm ; Marius had more or less been following them since , with a grim smile of utter indecision on his face . Marius had not seen Sylvia since the afternoon of his confession ; her drastic response had , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After his humiliation he had felt very angry and had a vision in which he seduced Sylvia , there she was lying naked on his bed , and he laughed at her  --  in the vision he even spat on the floor  --  and walked out of the room ( the vision allowed that he himself was fully clothed ) . He rated himself most severely for this feeling of vengefulness , which , however , he could not help having , and decided that the best thing would be never to see her again . Surely she must perceive , if she had  --  which he was not altogethersure she did  --  any delicacy at all , that he had given into her hands a certain power over himself , perhaps the greatcstpower one person can have over another in the limits of polite society , the power of making him appear ridiculous.  |p186On  the other hand , did he not have the same power over her ? The situation of the anonymous letters , and the incredibleattitude of Dr. Mirabeau , were sufficient subjects for humor . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand-off between them , or they would be two blackmailers taking in each other'swashing ; the figure confused but the meaning clear . He had decided finally to stand on his dignity ; she would have to make the first move . And in keeping with this decision he had not seen her for a week or so . Then he had turned his attention to Elaine , who was , he told himself , younger , more attractive than Sylvia , blessedly unattached , altogether more suitable ; he even began to think of marriage . And now this ! It was like moving in a dream down one corridorafter another , and finding at the end of each one Julian . Kissing in the tomb ! it was horrifying  --  by which he meant as he honestly acknowledged that he was envious . He debated whether he should scurry round to the other end of the hall and casually approach them so that they should pass face to face  --  if he did this , he would with generous irony and the most exact punctiliousness stare at Julian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combining scrupulouscourtesy and sophistication with the cut direct . He did not ( lo it , however , because while he would have loved to embarrassJulian he feared to offend Elaine . Marius had spoken to this girl but once ; she had no idea , could have no idea , of his possibly feeling anything in particularabout herself ; yet he already imagined himself in love with her , saw his pathetic figure skulking behind Egyptian statues as the rejected suitor , and attributed this chance revelationin the Museum to design , to her conscious cruelty ; all this of course increased his sour love . But if he did not approach them , then there was nothing to be gained by staying in the Museum . He watched them for ap187moment more , strolling hand in hand away from him just as though their being together were the most honorable and uprightthing in the world . Marius hastened away with his secret knowledge , knowing he would use it  --  somehow , he did not yet know how  --  and regretting for an instant at the same time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detachmentwhich made him the keen observer that he was . " But that 's nothing , " he said as he went down the steps outside , " I am a suitor , I am entering the arena , this that is happening to me is love . " He walked away in a confusion of feeling . " As for that Julian , " he thought grimly , " he is living in a fool 's purgatory . " ALL IN ALL , Sylvia considered , things were looking up ; for nearly a week she had not seen Marius , and during that time there had been no anonymous letters . Could there be , perhaps , some connection ? She had also deliberately missed two appointments with Dr. Mirabeau , and was beginning to hope the doctor would simply and without comment of any sort submit his final bill at the end of the month  --  for of one thing she was very certain , she was not going back to him , not even for so long as it would take to explain that she was not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really her trouble all that long time ? Not that she believed he had sent the letters , no , she would not go so far as to think that even of him  --  but might it not be true , at least in the odd world of the psyche , not that one went to the doctor because one was sick , but that one was sick because one went to the doctor ? It might well be , look what had happened to Alma . It even seemed to her that her husband was becoming kinder again , more attentive and loving , even erotically interesting ,  |p188all  of a sudden ; this too had happened since she left off going to Mirabeau . Sylvia liked to think that things solved themselves the easy way if given the chance ; she began to see the tension between herself and Julian , accordingly , as " one of those times that come up in every marriage , " while as for the anonymous letters , though she remained puzzled , she decided at the end of a week without them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle about . Something nasty had undoubtedly happened , and been felt , reflected , in her behavior and Julian 's ; but she would be willing to settle for its being over , even if this meant she never would understand exactly what had happened . Had she known the letters would stop , she reflecteda little angrily , she never would have told Dr. Mirabeauand consequently she would not have been subjected to the humiliation of being thought insane . But then  --  looking on the bright side  --  she would never have had , either , the nerve to break off the treatment , never would have discovered in a sufficiently convincing way how blind that treatment could be to whatever happened from the outside , how it refused to believe in anything not inwardly provided for . So it was an ill wind which had blown this much good at least . Again , she would not , had she known there would be no more letters , have told Marius of them either ; but then neither would she , probably , ever have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd ) secret , which put her on even terms with him . She hoped , even so , that Marius was not vastly offendedover his confession and her uncontrollable response  --  surely he must be able to see the enormous humor of it ?  --  and determined , though she would not be the first to break the silence , that when next they met , which would most likely be at Hugo 's wedding a few days hence ( the divorce-bak 'd meats , you might say ) , she would be very kind to Marius , and sayp189something  --  she did not know exactly what  --  which would indicate sympathy and secrecy ; and to which he must reply ( of course ! ) with like indications about the confidence she had placed in him . Doubtless the whole thing , as Sylvia vaguely phrased it , was going to die down and be forgotten ; whatever Julian may have been thinking it was evident that lie had now changed his mind  --  whatever had happened , for example , during Hugo 's party , would not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point was , she now saw , to live a full , busy life ; it was only in idleness that one became infected with dreams in which life might be otherwise . One could , of course , continue in the most innocent way to be good friends with a young man I ike Marius , if that were an arrangement in which he would sensibly co-operate . But anything else , so far as she was concerned , would be out of the question , though perhaps with regrets . Of course it would be nice , in some ways , to have an affair ; but things simply were not constituted in that way these days ( she had a moment of doubt here ; were they not ? ) , and the point about taking marriage seriously meant above all that one did not , absolutely did not and must not , make trouble . She resolved that some time soon she would have a friendly explanation with Marius on this score . " Of course we are tempted , " she would say in her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ideally , my dear , I should be delighted to go to bed with you , I 'm sure we should have a splendid time together  --  but one simply does not do such things . " In imaginationshe saw Marius nodding gravely and tenderly his assentto this proposition , which combined romantic charm with moral security ; and Sylvia believed that if he were any sort of man at all he would care for her more deeply than ever  --  she would even say as much : " If you are as intelligent and kind and good as I know you are . . . "  |p190Sylvia  's full , busy life at this moment centered around the preparations for Hugo 's wedding . Exactly what it would centeraround after that event she had not yet considered . There were numbers of things to be done in a short time , for the date had been set rather suddenly and late on account of the divorce . Sylvia still did not altogether approve of this marriage , it is true ; yet she was by nature incapable of remaining apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the invitations , she went with Louisa to give advice about what clothing would be suitable for England at this time of the year ; she arranged by herself the catering for the bon voyage party in the stateroom . " You know , suddenly I 'm very happy again , " she said to Julian one evening . " Ah , darling , " he said , with a kiss , and stroked her hair . " For a while I thought we were going to have a perfectly furious quarrel , " she confessed , " but love wins out again . I hate quarreling , I guess I 'm just not the violent type . I 'd rather just have everything go along smoothly . Real happiness is kind of quiet , just like this , sitting here with you , not sayingmuch . " " Ah well , every marriage has its ups and downs , " Julian replied , his feeling of unredeemable shame mixed with secrecyand triumphant contempt producing , with some effort , a commonplace . " Those horrible letters  --  ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her some physical discomfort , and raised his eyebrows . " Yes , the letters , " he said . " Darling , you did n't really believe there was anything wrong , did you ? " " I was a little uneasy , " he said in a joking tone , " you 're a damn ' attractive wench , you know . But then I decided I wasp191being silly  --  you 'd be incapable of keeping a secret for twenty minutes , would n't you ? " " But who is Federigo ? " she asked with a great sense of reliefthat these cards though face down were finally on the table . " Do you know ? " " I 've no idea , " Julian replied . " That was the most horrifyingthing  --  that feeling that we were being watched over by some stranger , or even by one of our friends posing as a stranger . " " You have n't got any more of them ? " she hesitantly asked , very much wanting not to know . " No , " said Julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a had job . If I ever catch up with him  --  " he added significantly , making a fist . " Well , if you do , " said Sylvia sensibly , " I hope he 's not bigger than you are . " This was the end of the discussion ; they were like two peopleexamining an infected wound and pretending to each other that the hard , inflamed spot which covered it represented the formation of new , healthy skin ; they probed very tenderly indeedaround the edges , and if the one winced the other pretendednot to see . Even Julian began to believe that this was a new life , if not necessarily a more honest one than the old , and that whatever happened with Elaine would at least have no connection with the letters of Federigo , which had served their purpose ( along with , perhaps , other , unforeseen purposes ) and were definitely at an end . He reminded himself , however , that the activities of the detectives were not at an old ; the most recent report let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone shopping with Louisa , with whom she then had lunch and went to a movie ; the evening he had been with Julian himself , who thus appeared like a stranger ( an odd feeling , again as if he were in a play orp192movie ) in the report directed to himself . All this , if dull in the reading , was impeccable domestically . Ah well , he supposedhe must keep these bloodhounds on the track at a rather considerable expense  --  until Hugo left with Louisa on his honeymoon ; then he would tell Mr. Bilsiter it had all been a mistake , or at any rate that he did not want the trailing continued , and the whole matter would be forgotten by the time Hugo returned from England . There was , meanwhile , one little thing that troubled Sylvia , though she talked of it with no one , and this was the odd feelingwhich overtook her now and then , wherever she happened to be during the day , that someone had his eye on her ; she could sense it , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be receptive to a stare . But however often and suddenlyshe turned around , in a crowded restaurant or walking down the street , she was unable to identify her follower , if she had one , which she came finally to believe she had not . " Now this , " she told herself , " would be the ideal tale to put before Mirabeau , who would call it entirely subjective  --  and in this instance he 'd be entirely right , too . It is the beginning of a mild form of persecution-feeling ; I was worried and guilty over things last week , and this is a kind of psychical hangover from that time . If I simply relax , and realize it is my own conscience which is following me around , everything will be all right . " The uncomfortable feeling persisted , however , or at least it returned intermittently during each day , and Sylvia bore it stoically . One evening , when as it happened Julian was out  --  it was the second time in the week that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vacation was coming soon , and there was a good deal to clean up before he could leave  --  Sylvia had a phone call from Hugo , who said he would like to have a talk with her.  | " Why do n't you come over here ? " she said , thinking this must have to do with the arrangements for the wedding ; and Hugo promised to come . " Where 's Jay ? " he asked , and when Sylvia told him that Jay , poor thing , had to work late , Hugo raised his thick eyebrows . " His vacation is coming soon , " she explained on seeing this expression . " Where do you plan to go ? " " No idea , " she said . " We have n't even thought of it yet . " " Ah . " Hugo was not a man who could be comfortable in the possession of secret knowledge ; his awareness that Sylvia , who was possibly unfaithful to her husband , was being shadowedby detectives which Hugo himself , moreover , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he really did like Sylvia as much as he claimed to do ; so he reminded himself that he personally , Hugo , wanted this question of the anonymous letters cleared up , it was all  --  detectives , that is  --  for their own good , it was his business to see his friends happy again , which was as a matter of fact the errand he had come here on . " Look , I have a notion , " he exclaimed , as if it had just come to him . " Why do n't you just take over my place on Long Island for your vacation ? At Lantern Point . " " Oh , Hugo , we could n't do that , " said Sylvia , thinking that this might be very nice indeed . " And why not ? Do you both good to get away from  --  well , to get away from civilization for a bit . It seems to me you 've both been under some strain , these last weeks . " So it had showed ? But of course it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have showed , considering her behaviorat Hugo 's party , Julian 's absence . . . ? A moment of anxious doubt overtook her , and she smiled gaily.  | " Every marriage has its ups and downs , " she said . " Sylvia , " Hugo said earnestly , " I want you to tell me one thing  --  are you and Jay  --  are you , that is , breaking up , have you thought of doing that ? " " Darling Hugo , " she replied , " you of all people must surely know that married couples do now and again think of such things  --  that 's one of the thoughts that keep them going . " " Ah , then it 's not serious , " he said heavily . " I 'm so glad . You two , you know , are just right together , never let anyone tell you otherwise . And if you ever have any little troubles , why , I hope you 'd let me know before you do anything , well , anything odd . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sylvia , I hope you have n't been having any  --  wrong ideas . About Julian the other night . " " Wrong ideas ? " " Such as  --  well , you know what I mean . I happen to know , " Hugo said impressively , " that Jay left that party only because he was unhappy and wanted to be alone for a while . He went to a bar and while he was there he got into a fight with some drunk . So if you 've been thinking anything else , Syl , get rid of it right off . " " Hugo , how do you happen to know all this ? " " Because , of course , Jay confessed it to me . I can tell when a man like Jay is telling the truth and when he 's not , I 've known Jay for longer than you have . " And did he also confess , " Sylvia asked , " what he was unhappyabout , that he had to leave the party to be alone ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hugo said , " but after all , you know , you were giving one or two fairly good reasons , yourself , why he might have been . "  | " Yes , " said Sylvia , frowning . " I 'm sorry I was a fool at your party , Hugo . " " Oh , that . " He waved it away . " Do n't think of it . I only wanted to be sure everything was all right between you two . " " We did have a few bad days , you know how it is , " Sylvia said , " but everything 's fine now  --  so far as it 's your business , darling , " she added sweetly , but Hugo was not embarrassed . " Of course it 's my business , " he said , " when my friends are unhappy . But whatever it was , " he went on after a pause , " I 'm delighted you 've cleared it up . I 've always thought about you two , you know , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are faithful types , you could n't do anything out of line if you had to . It would hurt too much . With me , " he added reflectively , " it 's different . Even now , you know , and I 'm terribly in love with Louisa , I can see the time coming when I shall want someone else , it 's just my nature . But I suffer for it , Syl , you know that . " " Hugo , I 'm sure you do , " said Sylvia , " even if , " she could not resist adding , " it must be great fun to suffer in just that manner . " She softened this remark with a smile , which Hugo returned . " Now then  --  what about the place ? Say you 'll take it , Sylvia , it will give me pleasure to think someone 's getting a bit of use of it Elaine and her mother would n't think of going up there again , I do n't believe they liked it one bit and I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate . It 's primitive , you know , I 've deliberately kept it that way . Out on this lonely point on the dunes , it looks over the sea  --  it used to be a smuggler 's hide-out , the original house , you can still see the foundations . They used to light bonfires there to deceive ships into wrecking on the shoal , and then they 'd plunder the wreck . Mooncussers , they were called , because they hated the fullp196moon that gave them away . There 's a wood stove and fireplaces , you 'll find plenty of wood left . No electricity , of course , and you get the water from a well , you pump it up . I think you and Jay would enjoy it . Be fine for you , too . " " It sounds wonderful , " Sylvia said , dubiously imagining herself drawing water from a well . " I 'll think about it , and talk it over with Julian . " " Nonsense , surprise him , " Hugo said . " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the car and take off , you 'll both love it . Do say you 'll have it . " Sylvia accepted the key , reflecting that they might . actually go up there . To live the simple life , she thought , to get away from things for a while . . Hugo kissed her at the door before leaving . This kiss beganas a friendly salute , which he with some force prolonged and finally attempted to convert into something quite different ; Sylvia pushed him away rather angrily . " There are faithful types and unfaithful types , just as you say , " she reminded him , and he laughed . " I do n't know why I wanted to do that , " he said . " For old times ' sake , maybe . We 're getting older , darling , we 're all getting older . I could love you again , Syl , " he added , " I could ask you to go to bed with me again just for that , because we 're getting older and , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? Or maybe , " he continued , philosophically rubbing his behind against the edge of the door which was swinging back and forth , " maybe it 's more that I want to betray Louisa even now , already , or that I just dread getting married again even if I do love her . There 's a lot of hate in love , is n't there , you get a kind of need to do the dirty on someone just because you love her . The first time I was unfaithful to Alma , you know , I kept thinking about her all the time . It was like slappingher face and saying over and over , Take that , and that ,  |p197and  that . ' Like in the movies . " He laughed again . " It was more like sleeping with Alma than sleeping with Alma was . " " Are you saying , " Sylvia asked dangerously , " that you felt that way with me ? " " No , this was well before your time , darling , " said Hugo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was going too far , according to Sylvia 's expression . " It 's just the kind of rotten no-good I am , " he said apologetically . " That does n't need much further demonstration , " Sylvia said . " Syl , one more kiss , darling , " he said . " For old times ' sake , and to say the world 's not worn out yet . Another couple of days , you know , and I 'm lost forever . " Feeling a certain wry , inward humor in all this that it would be all right to do very near anything so long as you felt you loved only your own husband  --  Sylvia accorded Ilugo this farewell kiss . She felt herself caressed as from a great distance , a distance of more than seven years , and it seemed not to matter at all . These fumbling hands and squeezingfingers , the soft lips and behind them the hard teeth , what were they searching for in her body ? She seemed to be standingback and looking at this body receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , for whom she felt both pity and contempt . " Darling girl , " muttered Hugo as she pushed him away . lie sounded drunk , though he was not ; that was what the body did , the empty body with no one at home inside . " It would have been fun , " he said , recovering himself and smiling down at her . " Yes , I 'm sure it would have been great fun , " said Sylvia , and closed the door firmly after him.  |p198THE  WEDDING of Hugo Alter and Louisa Leonard took place in church , very solemn and ceremonious ; everyone was beautifully dressed and took a serious if not a reverent interestin all that went on . Julian Ghent , being best man , had a close view of the proceedings , and as he did not bow his head more than a little at the appropriate moments , found himself regarding the combed and plastered silver hair of the minister from a distance of only a couple of feet during a considerable part of the service . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus for Julian agreeablefeelings of righteous displeasure which mingled with his conventional wishes for Hugo 's ( and Louisa 's ) happiness and with the emotion , not religious in form but connected commonly with all the higher and mightier observations of the passage of time , which he felt no less than most who were present , and which even brought tears to his eyes . He morally resented the authority over love which everyone was compelled to assume in the minister as the witness of church and state ; he resented the power which must be really present in the business to bring him close to tears ; he resented the rich , golden and vested hypocrisy which in a muted voice sanctified by compulsion . Julian did not weep , but he felt the tears in his eyes and the slight trembling of the chin which had always warned him , in childhood , that he was going to cry . Instead , so as not to , he fiercely concentrated on the bowed , silver hair before him , and wondered whether clergymen were trained to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , in the hope of achieving just this dull silvery luster which seemed , for himself at least , the quintessence of past time together with the seriousness and sorrow of life . Asp199he handed Hugo the ring Julian was reminded that his grandfather , who died in Julian 's childhood , had had just such silver hair , metallically combed and plastered and stiff , thin enough to allow a view of the skin of his head ; this grandfatherdied in the winter , and because he used to winter in Florida the story given to the child Julian was that Grandfatherhad gone away to Florida . Julian had been sent out to the Park to play , he remembered it was a bitter cold , dark day with which he always associated a sepia picture of Florida on a postcard  --  a picture of the Everglades , a writhing of rich vegetation and one passage of reflective , shiny water in the foreground , ali of it of course in the dark rotogravure brown which was then the fashion . Here , then , in the minister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair through which the scalp gleamed , this returned to Julian , not flooding suddenly back like a revelation but slowly spreading and sinking like a stream released over soft ground : how the name of death , when he learned it , had taken on that chocolatebrown together with the smell of the postcard itself , which was in turn associated with the characteristic smell of Florida  --  where he had never gone , perhaps because Florida and the Everglades were the names of death  --  and which carried with it the forbidding bitterness of that afternoon in Central Park , with the keen wind which had brought the tears to his eyes and numbed his fingers . Standing there beside Hugo and Louisa Julian suddenly felt sorry for his grandfatherwho was more than a quarter of a century in his grave , a lone and unthought of by anyone save , for this instant , Julian himself , who seemed to enter for a moment the cold , bitter Everglades of the mind . It was strange that the celebration of happiness should bring with it this ancient image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration of happiness mentioned thep200name of death , reminded of it and of the provisional nature of the happiness whose relation to time was here being so seriously remarked . Oh , my friends , he thought , I do hope you will be happy . But even the thought carried with it all unlikelihood , and induced in Julian 's mind a sophistication quite the reverse of what his inward exclamation sincerely intended ; he saw the marriage as mockery , all its implicationsof virginity and freshness amazed and made the best of by an old gentleman in an odd costume whose silvery hair had the dull gleam of a counterfeit half-dollar , or for that matter a real one . Louisa was very handsome in a gown of heavy white satin . Hugo looked solemn , imposing , somehow ever so slightly pathetic as he gave the appearance of listening to the words of the service with great attention  --  as though he might put them down in a notebook and check his daily conduct against these recommendations which smoothly flowed from the minister'smouth . Mrs. Leonard wept happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the taxi on the way to the boat , and throughout the nervous , rather dreary party which occupied the two hours or more before sailing time . On account of the confined space of the cabin  --  a quite capacious one for ordinary purposes  --  the party was small and gave the impression of being enormous : " Not more than three hundred most intimate friends , " Marius observed to Julian ; moreover , pieces of hand-baggage were everywhere , and presents  --  flowers , baskets of fruit and baskets of bottles of whisky  --  continued to arrive the whole time . Everyonewas standing up , talking , smoking , drinking ; for a background , which one became aware of only intermittently , there was the slight , preparatory trembling of the vessel itself , the humming sound that went with it , now and then a huge blastp201of the horn which caused all the guests to pick up their belongingsand look nervously around , and the purposeful rush of all sorts of people , including officials , past the open door of the suite . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgency , as the time of departure brought to the surface people 's worst anxieties about a possiblefailure to get off the boat before it left  --  an anxiety which punished , Dr. Mirabeau might have said , their dreamlikewish to remain on the boat and sail off forever ; there were arguments about the time , and a sentence frequently repeated was : " Do n't worry , they 'll warn us when it 's time to go . " All this was very fatiguing to the nerves , not least because prolonged farewells tend to lose their character in a few moments , leaving what remains to betray itself finally as an uncontrollable wish to escape . At the center of all this , a peculiar force of secret awareness , which might be given very generally the name of love , related several of these people in a network of unequal tensions : the exclusive character of these relations was witnessed by a superficial gaiety spread among them all , which disguised , or at least intended to disguise , isolated and secret communications of some urgency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not  --  not in particular , anyhow  --  of " the kind of person " Hugo was so far as this related to herself ; she could even perceive this honeymoon voyage not as a setting forth into the new and the unknown but as an interlude in a possible , highly theoretical relation , not yet by any means over , between herself and lingo ; this thought formed a kind of revenge , very remotely , for the sake of Alma , so that Sylvia could look on the new bride with superior pity , poor thing . This awareness of hers was concealed also from her husband Julian , who did not know either the quality of Sylvia 's relation with Marius  --   |p202what  it had been , what it now was , what it might be  --  nor the secret of Marius himself for that matter , whose elegant , learned , altogether fictitious affectation of Catholicism made for something esoteric and aristocratic in his presence . Marius , Sylvia saw , was talking with Elaine , over near the window . Now that would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marius would have to give up his rather bohemian ways and take a job , but if he did he and Elaine might make a lovely couple ; both quite small , thin , highly bred ( all this in appearance , anyhow ) and charmingly young . Sylvia imaginedherself as the Older Woman , stepping out of his life with a gracious smile and the hint of tears , to whom the young people would owe their happiness ; all this , of course , as she realized with a slight start , began with the assumption that she had first been the young man 's mistress , otherwise it would lack its romantic significance . If Marius had not chosen that moment , the other day , for his confession , if it had not struck her as so ridiculous  --  if , if , if  --  who knows what might have happened ? It was so easy to make a mistake . Marius , who would in a few minutes tell Elaine of his love for her  --  would he tell her of his having seen her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with delighted detachment the last rewards of irony . He saw Sylvia  --  looking at her with keen , neutral attention across the stateroom , a tall , serenely beautiful woman in a severely cut suit of navy blue  --  as eaten inwardly with doubt and self-distrust and unhappiness over the anonymous letters which , with Dr. Mirabeau , had very nearly driven her into adultery with Marius himself ; and as invincibly ignorant , at the same time , of the real occasion available for her despair to feed upon ; that her husband was deceiving her with Elaine , who looked at this moment the picture of pretty innocence as she smiled at something he , Marius , had just finished saying . As for Julian him/self , whom the anonymous letters must have worried  --  not quite needlessly , it would seem  --  about the conduct of his wife , Julian seemed at this moment the ideal victim , being as he must be at once worried and happy , scared of unknown and generalized danger but meanwhile quite foolishly secure in the secrecy of his passion which was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship beneath his feet were part of the exultation of his power , and knavishly concluded that if he could at one and the same time make Sylvia and betray Julian to her , this power would have wrought its beautiful utmost ; after which  --  and even through which  --  he would love only Elaine . Elaine for her part regarded Sylvia with what is usually called honest pity  --  a misnomer , since this virtue is almost by definition excluded from the feeling of pity . She felt quite attracted to Julian , and she loved situations of a certain danger ; they were , in fact , the only things she did love . Her feelings for Julian were experimental , but boldly so ; not unlikelyshe would go to bed with him , some little time after lie asked her to , if the adventure could be kept light , casual , charming ; there was a regrettable tendency she had noted in .1 ilian , he wanted to be in love , with all the serious , irrevocableand somehow disconsolate connotations of the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her own toughness , a kind of knowingness about the world which should ( and did ) surprise gentlemen of thirty-five or so in a girl of twenty , and an ability to take excellent care of a self which , whatever else she gave or seemed to give , kept its privacy and sufficiency . Looking over now at her lover 's wife , Elaine was like the executioner whose superlative technique can detach the head from the body so suddenly that the victim mercifully will have  --  so far as human beings can tell  --  no time in which to feel pain . As for Marius , with whom shep204was talking at this moment , he was a sweet boy who transparentlywas going to tell her in a few minutes that he loved her ; Elaine had no real objection to his doing so at all , but hoped he would not be pathetic , if only for his own sake , since what she admired happened to be strength and a certainruthlessness  --  the thing , perhaps , which attracted her to Julian , whom ordinarily she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carelessness he displayed about his poor wife , and this carelessness more than anything else would prevent her from ever getting to know , since it was as a rule , she believed , when people became serious and sad in love that they made fatal errors . Love was most charming when it involved deceit . As for Julian , he too was possessed at this moment with a delighted awareness of his superior power in having at the same time in the one room his wife and the girl with whom he was in love ; it was like seeing two express trains which seemed to be rushing toward one another at a great speed of closing but proved at the last possible instant to be on separate tracks so that they passed one another in perfect safety , with the appearance of accident , of luck , yet with the consent in reality of forethought and plan . And no one knew ! He smiled at Elaine , who happened to glance his way , and she smiled back ; the secret seemed to shuttle palpably through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time disturbed Julian 's Machiavellian pleasure , and this was the momentary thought of Federigo , who remained to him , it appeared , as a kind of legacy left over from the anonymous letters . He is the Devil , Julian thought , and , simultaneously : I am insane . But both these thoughts , deep in the silence of his body  --  he felt them , as it were , in his stomach rather than his head  --  rather increased than diminished his feeling of reckless , arrogant mastery over the nature of things . Hep205smiled at Sylvia , who was not looking at him ; this smile might have gone between her ribs and killed her . He was even willingto smile at Marius , that poor , prissy little gentleman , who was talking so earnestly  --  doubtless wittily as well  --  to Elaine , not knowing of course that this was Julian 's Elaine whom he tried so hard to impress . Marius returned the smile somewhat angrily , he thought , and Julian decided this smile might refer also to Marius 's having attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports would seem negativelyat least to show  --  unassailable ; and Marius , unable to make his friend 's wife , was unaware of turning now toward his friend 's prospective mistress . Julian 's feeling of towering , isolated strength increased until it seemed it might topple from an insane height . Hugo , who was becoming more drunk than anyone present , felt grateful to everyone indiscriminately ; everyone seemed to co-operate in making his life charming and happy . He was , in a way , honest with everyone , so that they all must love him for exactly what he was , which he supposed to be something of a minor villain ; whatever anyone of his acquaintance did , so far as marriage was concerned , he could always compare himself to his own advantage with Hugo . Therefore people did not want him to change , they needed him just as he was , and it was as if Louisa somehow embodied the expression of their gratitude to him . She was beautiful , and her beauty was enhanced in the light of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sacrificed to him . He sought out Julian and tried to express to him something of this feeling of being , as he said , " like a God . " Julian nodded rather distantly to all this , and Hugo remembered that his friend had troubles of his own ; he inquired about the progress of the detective reports . " Nothing , " said Julian , " perfectly clear . "  | " I knew it , " Hugo cried enthusiastically . " What did I tell you  --  you 've nothing to worry about . " " Except , of course , " Julian added , " she had a visit from you the other night  --  you were there for a little over an hour , according to the report . " He laughed . " Are you the man , Hugo ? " Then he added , " I think probably the best thing to do is drop the whole business . There have not been any more letters . And this Bilsiter is being so absurdly thorough , he called up and asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything in the past , had I ever been away for any length of time  --  that sort of thing . " " Oh , really , you do n't say ? " said Hugo , with an abrupt change of expression . Marius meanwhile had told Elaine bluntly that he was in love with her , and now sought some means of demonstrating his knowledge without altogether giving it away . " Do you see much of our friend Ghent these days ? " " No , of course not , " Elaine replied , " is there some reason why I should ? " " No reason at all , " Marius said with dark significance , " absolutely no reason . I just thought I 'd ask , " he added . " He 's in rather a bad spot , you know , these days . " " Oh , really ? " " Yes , it seems he gets these anonymous letters suggesting his wife is unfaithful to him . Letters signed by someone who calls himself Federigo . " " Why , I know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it could n't be that one , that 's Federigo Schwartz , for he 's away on a world cruise and besides , he does n't know Julian , I do n't think . He is Mr. Ghent 's double , did you know that ? The spit of him , like twins . " " Oh , is he , indeed ? " Marius smiled a sinister smile indicativeof more understanding than he actually at this momentp207was in possession of . Here was a strange new piece of information to be deeply considered ; there was a Federigo , he was the image of Julian Ghent ; what did one make of that , now ? He looked very intently at Elaine . " Is she , do you think , " asked Elaine , " unfaithful , I mean ? " " All I mean is , " he said to her , " that because of this situation in which our friend Ghent finds himself , his tastes may be a little capricious just now , and one ought not to take very seriously , for example , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise ; Marius thought she was wonderful at this moment . " My dear , do n't threaten me , " was all she said . " Are you in love with him ? " Marius asked in a low voice . " Of course not , " Elaine replied with a little laugh . " And you must n't be so serious , yourself , either  --  if you love me , " she added , " you must please me a great deal and make me happy . No romantic sulks , now . " So the party continued for some time ; everyone had a secret from someone and for this reason believed himself powerful , sometimes this belief was erroneous . A was victorious over B , B over C , but when it came to the end of the alphabet , A would be found to have been conquered by Z. Finally the visitors were warned that it was time to leave the ship and they collected their belongings and began confusedly stragglingout on deck . Hugo went as far as the gangplank with Julian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible moment , drunk , blushing , and speaking very fast in a low voice , he told his friend that he had been the man who , seven years before , had got Julian 's wife Sylvia with child . Julian stopped walking and simply stared at Hugo stupidly . " I suppose I should tell you to hit me , " Hugo said , a helplessexpression on his broad , red face . " Go ahead , it 's yourp208right , " he added , more or less thrusting his face forward to be hit , and helpfully adding , " I wo n't hit back . " Julian was unable to do anything at all , he stood there as if paralyzed . " This way , please , " an officer cried . The crowd moved , swayed , sifted down the gangplank carrying Julian mercifully along with the others ; Hugo himself was very nearly taken off the boat in this manner . There followed a tiresome period during which all Hugo 's friends stood on the pier waving their handkerchiefs , though Julian , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could not be certain whether he was waving farewell or simply shaking his fist with a handkerchief in it . To be on the safe side , he did a little of both , and hoped that it left Hugo in doubt too.  |p209JULIAN  GHENT , when young and a single man , had been quite unsuccessful with women . He betrayed himself time after time by being evidently too eager when he should have been restrained , a little aloof , or even downright disdainful . Some older and more adept ladies would even tell him about this fault , making an artifice and a convention out of what they were supposed to feel in the course of nature , but even guided by this good advice Julian continued to be too candid in revealing his desire , so that nearly all ladies , however much they liked and even ( some of them ) loved him , continued to deny the final gift of their favors . For the first axiom in love is that whoever does not despise is despicable ; love is , like chess , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a draw very infrequent except between grandmasters . The most poignant thing was that the young Julian had known all this quite well in theory , but was always afraid to put it into practice to the extreme degree that would have been necessary . His love affairs always began well , for when his feelings were not involved beyond admiration and desire he possessed naturally a fine arrogance which made it seem as though the advances were being made from the other side ; but as soon as he saw the overwhelming effect he was having on the girl of his choice he would respond helplessly by falling in love ( perhaps with the image of himself which he saw reflected in her eyes ) , and he would say to himself : " Allp210right , then , she loves me , let us drop the pretense . " A fatal error , since it was certainly with the pretense that the girl had been in love , and she , her own ambition to servility and degradation thus put off , would take her revenge by a mockingcoldness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pains of love as soon as she saw that these pains could be suffered instead by Julian . And this attitude of hers , which he as much as anyone had created , would further inflame in the young man an unhappy passion , or a passion perhaps for unhappiness , which increased as the chances of satisfaction diminished ; he would grow bitter and disagreeable , until quite soon even the friendship which was tacitly supposed to replace love would become unendurable to the girl , and all was over . This flaw in Julian 's nature would perhaps never have been overcome by any internal resources ; he would be , it was possible to predict , all his life a failure at the edge of success , a perpetually bitter optimist . Yet his weakness  --  of inveteratepride , vanity , sentimental greed  --  had oddly been made over into strength by his marriage . Not only did the satisfaction of the immediate desires of the flesh allow him to be less urgent about woman generally , but also the jealousy of his wife , by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian with exactly that aloofnessand restraint necessary to let his more attractive qualities shine forth , so that at parties other women were frequently found trying to get him off into corners and sometimes making improper suggestions to him . The dignified coldness of his response humiliated and further inflamed these women , so that Julian perceived now how successful he might have been had circumstances not made success impossible to take hold of . What he did not perceive was the paradox , that this sue/cess he could not take hold of was owing entirely to his wife Sylvia , who thoughtlessly , by the reflection in him of her jealousy and strict views , made her husband attractive to other women . Had his marriage been suddenly annulled , Julian would doubtless next day have relapsed into his weakwilled , pleading ways , and been spurned again by everyone . These considerations lead to the further thought that it is , after all , virtue which seduces to love . Thus the high price placed on virginity warrants a certain reticence which is lovable because it is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover to humiliation and hurt . The whole proposition is morally wicked , perhaps economicallyunsound , but , however , erotically and abysmally virtuous . Julian 's relations with Elaine Leonard developed , according to the familiar pattern ( with certain technical differences on account of his being married ) , in the direction of unhappinessand began to exchange their original freedom for bondage . The charm of leading a double life , in the first place , began to go sour on him ; moreover , he realized it could not be kept up for very long ; something was bound to give , one way or another . There was even a danger that Elaine , who was perhaps not so much cruel as young and thoughtless , and who , whatever else she was , happened not to be a coquette or tease , might become bored and consequently explode the whole business herself  --  for fun , as she put it on one crucial occasion . Sylvia had gone to the movies and Julian , telling himself that the time had come , pretended to be tired so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this did not prevent him from at once phoning Elaine to suggest , with a show of carelessness , that he was alone and she might if she liked come over for a drink ; she had never before been in his apartment . He re/gretted this step as soon as he hung up the phone , and twenty minutes later Elaine arrived . She was dressed , with a kind of sacrificial simplicity , in black , without jewelry or any accent of ornament , and this costume , together with a kind of quiet tension in her demeanor , informed Julian plainly that she had come to him as his mistress . This was so , as even he had to admit , as a result of his own intentions , his own actions ; he was delighted , of course , in a certain highly theoretical way , also frightened , but not merely in theory . At once he imagined Sylvia , bored with the movie , returning early . His own hypocrisy repelled him , but the idea of ignominious discovery ( and possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said so long ago , " and possibly you as well " ) inspired a kind of nervous terror . While he fixed drinks in the kitchen , Elaine wandered around the living room , looked at the books , the furniture , the pictures ( there was the picture of Sylvia , too , gazing around as if suspiciously ) and said " What a lovely place . " The dogs , Troilus and Cressida , frisked around her , and she admired the dogs ( " What lovely dogs " ) . Julian brought in the drinks and suggested she might like to see the rest of the apartment . Elaine agreed , and they spent a few minutes in this way ( " And this is the kitchen " . . . " Here is the bedroom " ) but as it was a small place there was not a great deal to be shown ; also the furniture appeared to Julian to be staring at him in a peculiarly disagreeable and knowing fashion . Elaine conventionallyadmired everything ; finally they returned to the living room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave sweetness : " You asked for me , and here I am . " And she put up her face to be kissed . Julian obediently took her in his arms . Out of the corner of his eye he saw Sylvia staring out of the portrait . The kiss was prolonged , and became quite impassioned ;  |p213it  represented to Julian a new depth of self-disgust and , perhaps for this very reason , an intensification of pleasure ; treachery , violation , hatred even , were the things which gave point to his love for Elaine . " I love you , darling , " he whispered , with an eye to the portrait . " Do you want me ? " she whispered back , and he replied " Of course I do . " They embraced again . Through the charming , somewhat alcoholic and bitter fragrance of her perfume Julian unwillingly became aware of the sour smell of her body in heat ; this is reality , he thought in desire and wild fear , and let her go . " Not here , darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , and why not ? " She smiled at him her wicked , crooked , innocent smile . Julian glanced up at the portrait . " She might come back , " he said . " And anyhow  --  it would n't be fair . " " Who wants to be fair ? " she lightly asked , turning her back on him . " I love you , Elaine , " he offered again , somewhat helplessly . " Well , then . . . ? " " We must be honest  --  that 's the thing . " " And what does that mean ? " " Elaine , darling , if I told her  --  if we were perfectly honestabout this  --  there 's no shame to falling in love , is there ? Would you marry me if I were free ? " The girl , her face still averted , was silent for a moment . " No , " she said then , in a tone of judicious reflection . " No , I very much doubt I would . " Julian stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in a house which they had robbed and ruined together.  | " I do n't love you , darling , " she went on . " I do n't want to talk about love . This is fun , or it was supposed to be . The last thing I 'm interested in is breaking up one happy home "  --  she laughed angrily  --  " and starting another . That 's not my dish at all . " " But I 'm in love with you , " Julian repeated . " And here I am , " said Elaine . " What do we do about it ? " She turned back to face him , and there would have been perhapsanother embrace , but Julian was becoming thoroughly miserable . " Not here  --  not in this house , " he said with somewhat absurd firmness , the picture of a man putting his foot down and finding quicksand under it . " Your delicacy is marvelous , " she said . " Sylvia would be delighted . " " Please do n't say her name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him with a remote , objective curiosity . " Do n't you believe I have some right in this ? " she inquired . " I thought it was all so simple  --  you wanted me , you were attractive , I decided I wanted you  --  and now where are we ? " " Yes , darling , but not this way , " he exclaimed . " Not with her looking on . . . and she might come back , there 's that , is n't there ? " " Yes , there is that , " Elaine admitted . " This is being damn badly managed , is n't it ? " She seemed to consider for a moment , then asked , " Tell me , Jay , will you go away with me  --  will you meet me somewhere for the weekend ? " This proposition struck Julian as the perfect solution . Away , so long as it was anonymous and without particular character , and as it perfectly put off the embarrassment of the moment , appealed to him enormously.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously said even so , " tell Sylvia something , I do n't know what . Where would we go ? " " I 'm going to Hugo 's place anyhow , " said Elaine , " out at Lantern Point . If you want to come along  --  so . If you do n't  --  so , " she added carelessly . " I leave Friday . Tell Sylvia it 's a business trip I believe that 's what people commonly do , is n't it ? " " But I never take trips in my business . " Then this will be the first time , wo n't it ? " she said sweetly . " She 'll suspect , of course  --  wo n't she ? But what 's that ? And we 'll have a few days . We might even send her a postcard saying wish you were here . ' " " Do n't , please do n't be like that , " he begged her . " I only mean to say you must make up your mind . " Elaine picked up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up quizzically for an instant at the portrait of Sylvia , and said , " I 'm leaving on Friday . You 've got a couple of days to make up your mind and tell her some story or other . But it 's got to be by then  --  or else never . If you came along , " she added , " I might , I just barely might , decide to forgive your rudeness now . Do n't imagine it 's so pleasant for me , your conscience  --  such as it is . " " Darling , I 'll think of something , " Julian promised . " I 'll call you Friday morning . " A kiss , somewhat grudgingly and coldly given , was his rewardfor this pledge , and then Elaine , to his great relief , left . Almost as soon as the door closed behind her Julian began to wish things had been otherwise ; now he felt not only guilty but humiliated as well , and this humiliation , he dimly recognized , increased his love for Elaine , and satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be unfaithful to his wife . Thinking it over now , he found his originalp216motives almost impossible to recapture ; what he had started out to do , possess ( as he called it ) another woman , could be viewed in several ways : as a simple desire for sexual experienceelsewhere ( but it was certainly not simple , whatever it might be ) ; as an assertion of freedom ; as an expression of contempt for Sylvia ( that one hurt , it hit close to home ) ; as an enlargement of his own importance ; as a wish for secrecy and even criminality ; as curiosity about what evil was and where its place in the world ; finally , as a wish to be punished , caught and punished  --  a wish to find , or if necessary create , an objective situation consonant with those feelings of guilt and insufficiency with which he had begun . The verdict of guilt had been delivered first , so long ago ; what had to be discovered was the crime . Like a murderer silently cleaning up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses into the kitchen and washed them ; he also scrubbed the lipstick off his face . Then he realized it would not look natural for him to have sat home all evening without a drink , so he made himself a highball which he did not want and took it into the living room . " You 're not going to offer me one ? " asked Federigo , who was sitting on the couch looking at Sylvia 's portrait . Julian gave a slight start , but only from the suddenness ; it really frightened him that as a matter of fact he was not in the least surprised to see his curious acquaintance sitting there in the living room ; also , while he was disturbed ( naturally , who would not be disturbed ? ) he even , in a way , felt grateful to the presence of another person  --  especially one who was neither Sylvia nor Elaine . " So it 's you again , " he said rather curtly , and made another drink for Federigo , who took it without saying thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he were not used to drink . Federigo was dressed casu/ally in slacks and a shirt open at the throat ; he also wore sandals instead of shoes , and looked very much at his ease ; even impudently so , thought Julian  --  like a proletarian poet or some such individual . " Now what is it you want ? " Julian asked , determined upon boldness . " I ? I do n't want anything , I 'm perfectly content , " said Federigo , looking indeed the image of a man satisfied with himself . " You 're the one , my dear , who wants things . " He laughed . " Though the Lord alone knows what it is you want , when all 's said and done . As a lover , Julian , you 'd make a wonderful real-estate agent  --  and this is the kitchen , this is the bedroom , here is the bathroom . . . ' " Federigo imitated Julian 's voice very accurately , with overtones of sarcasm at the same time . He laughed again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn you , " he cried , " how do you know that ? " " Oh , I 've been here right along , " Federigo said , " only you overlooked me  --  as well you might , I suppose , under the circumstances . Julian , you remind me of a funny story . Do you want to hear a funny story ? " " No , I do not want to hear a funny story , " Julian said between his teeth ; but Federigo went right ahead anyhow , and Julian listened . " There was this man , this drunk , at a bar  --  I 'm sorry it begins in such a common way , but there it is , no help for that  --  and he made friends with a party of strangers . He fell more or less in love with them , the way drunks will , and when the bar closed he took them back to his house for one more drink . But when they got there he first insisted on showingthem over his home . They were unwilling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed them everything in the most boring detail  --  here is the living room , here is the hallp218and this is the closet , here is the kitchen . . . I wo n't take you through it all , I do n't want to bore you , Julian . Finally he led them upstairs into the bedroom , where he turned on the light . And here is our bedroom , ' he told them . That woman in the bed ' ( pointing at her ) is my wife , and that man lying next to her  --  that 's me . ' " Federigo laughed at his joke , but Julian did not . " I do n't see anything so funny in that , " he said with grumpy dignity , " and I do n't see that I 'm very like it , either . " " Oh , you do n't ? " asked Federigo . " Well , then , perhaps you 're not  --  how should I know ? " He looked curiously at Julian . " What are you like , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you know so much , " Julian replied , " I suppose you know that , too . " " I 've a fair idea , " admitted Federigo , " but have you ? There 's the point . Have you ever used a camera with one o f those split-image range-finders ? " he asked . " The sort where you see two images of what you aim at , and you turn a knob until at the right focal length the two images coincide and become one ? To me , " he said , " you are a man looked at through such a camera , not at the right focal length . " " Looked at , " Julian said doubtfully , " but by whom ? " " By yourself ? By God ? " Federigo spoke in a bored voice . " Who cares about that ? " " I care . Listen , Federigo , " Julian said earnestly , " tell me this plainly . Are you the Devil ? " " My dear boy , " drawled Federigo , relaxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an all but incredible naivete . Supposing I were the Devil , and you asked that , what sort of answer would you get  --  tell me plainly , be honest with poor no , dear Mister Devil '  --  how silly can you get ? And even if it became quite clear to you that I was the Devil , what then ? That 's only a name , you would still have to ask what devil218p219would so particularly belong to you . All this dramatic me retro Satanas kind of thing may be very well for the Saviour , but for you  --  no . You do n't want him behind you , after all , behind you is the direction of danger and the unknown  --  a fact which , by the way , also makes toilet training such a profoundinfluence on the Idea of the Good . And by the odd irony of history the great Descartes , inaugurator of the reign of reason , located the soul back there , behind the head in the pineal gland which is supposed nowadays to be the atrophied relic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear . No , Julian , on the whole you had better have your devil out in front of you , in full view  --  like myself , for example . " " I knew that about the pineal gland , " muttered Julian . " It was in Philosophy at college . " " Of course it was , " Federigo easily agreed . " And now you are playing with the notion that I am some sort of subjective hallucination , because I know only what is known to you . Well , that is a nice notion , I suppose , and quite comforting even if it does suggest you are not quite right in the head , because it is better to he a little queer , is n't it , than to be diabolically possessed ? Though some say , of course , that the two things are one . After all , the inner and the outer reality are very oddly married , are n't they ? The outer reality has never been seen except by the inner one and according to its own rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these modern times , " he added sarcastically , " therefore you can see only the external world which is made a part of your internal world  --  so that knowledge becomes a kind of cannibalism , you digest the virtues of your enemy and they become you in the process the courage of the warrior and the goodness of the missionary , all one in the stew . But of course even cannibals must be careful of whom they eat ; you might bite on a coward , a lecher , a thief or murderer , andp220become that  --  if the analogy is not getting a little too farfetchedto be followed . " " Then you are me ? " Julian asked . " I have n't said that either , " said Federigo . " You 're far too intellectual for your own good . Has n't it ever occurred to you that this world is a real world , and that things are profoundly and beautifully , sometimes , just what they seem to be ? Be more simple , Julian . " Federigo stood up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a walk in Central Park . There 's something I want to put before you . " " But my wife , " Julian objected , " she 'll be coming back , she will worry . . . " " You are admirably considerate , " Federigo said . " Nevertheless . . . " And for reasons he could not compass , Julian felt impelled and even willing to follow , taking only one precautionbefore they left , which was suggested to him by the thought of Central Park at night : he left behind his wallet , thinking in confused shame that if his dead body should be found out there in the morning it would be difficult if not impossible to identify . Federigo noted this and seemed to approveit , though somewhat satirically , saying : " I think you are wise to leave behind that little artificial heart ( you notice men typically carry their wallets in pockets so placed as to suggest a right-handed heart balancing the one on the other side ? )  --  not on account of the money , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one license plates which you usually wear on your public person . It is funny , " he added , " you were robbed of your watch , now you leave behind your wallet . It suggests the not absolute impossibilityof your ever learning from experience . " They walked together into the Park . Federigo insisted on linking his arm with Julian 's in a disagreeable sort of in/timacy , but on the other hand Julian felt quite safe with Federigoat his side . They skirted the dark bulk of the Museum of Art and climbed a small hill . " This is Cleopatra 's Needle , " said Federigo , pointing to the little obelisk at the top , " but of course  --  I 'd forgotten  --  you know rather a lot about Egyptian monuments by now , do n't you ? " Julian did not reply . " You will remember , " said Federigo , with something of the lecturer 's manner , " that this field over which we look was once water ? " " Yes , it was the Old Reservoir when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes , " Federigo said . " Now look again . " Julian opened his eyes and looked . There before him was the Old Reservoir again , with its low retaining wall of rough stone . He stood on the path and marveled ; it seemed to be daylight all around him . " Over there , to the left , where the Old Fort is  --  that 's where you used to play , most often , " Federigo said . " Come , let 's walk over that way . " They came to the place , which was full of nursemaids , children , baby carriages  --  exactly like real life , Julian thought , save that they seemed to see it from a great , empty distance . After a moment he realized this was so because of the silence ; it was all exactly like real life except that nothing made any noise ; there between the Reservoir and the playground , under the shadow of the Old Fort , he stood in mysteriousand silent daylight , unseen by anyone , and watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown corduroy shorts , " Federigo observed , " that is you , Julian . " Julian looked at the little creature who at this moment wasp222sitting in some dirt beside the path . He remembered those brown corduroy shorts , which for some reason made him want to cry . Now a governess , whom he remembered quite well though he could not come up with her name , walked over and picked the little Julian bodily out of the dirt and slapped him . There was an expression of absolute rage on her somewhat shriveled face . " That is Miss Collis , " said Federigo . " She was with you for a long time , and loved you quite well , really , little horror that you were . She is still alive , did you know that ? She slapped you in Central Park and she is still alive . She is in an asylum for the insane in upstate New York . It 's odd , is n't it , what becomes of people ? " Julian heard all this as from far away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed as though Miss Collis had really slapped him , hard , only an instant ago , and in part sadly because Miss Collis  --  he looked sorrowfully at her angry face in the playground  --  would one day be committed to an asylum for the insane . This feeling he had , of knowingthe future , and knowing it also as the present , seeing all things , past , present and future , as one , was a feeling of strange power but also of reverence ; he seemed to hear himselfsaying , " You see , one looks at these things , but one does n't touch them . " A moment later he realized this had been said , however , not by himself but by Federigo . The little Julian had by now stopped bawling over the slap ; he was playing in the midst of other children : Tommy Burns , Edward Cohn , Alexander something or other , a little girl named Genevieve , and two others whom Julian could not remember . Federigo supplied their missing names . " Rita Larson , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you grew up . No , do n't worry , she is still among us , she married quite well  --  a banker in Trenton , New Jcr/sey  --  she has several children , the eldest daughter looks rather as she did then  --  or does now , if you 'd rather put it that way . The little boy you do n't remember for a rather good reason ; it was he who taught you about masturbation , you finally founded a sort of social club for the purpose and had an excellent time until the governess  --  not Miss Collis but another one found you all in the bushes one afternoon . That little boy is Raymond Berenger , of course , and he now teaches at a prep school in New England somewhere , though unhappily he will soon be fired for homosexual practices with the students  --  you see , Julian , you had quite literally a hand in that as well . " Alexander Hanson , now , " he went on , " died in the war , at Bastogne . Edward Cohn never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after what you are looking at now he came down with mastoiditis , was operated on and died in the hospital . You forgot about him , as children will , in a few days . " This seemed to Julian the most frightful and cruel outrage of all , though he did not see why . Tears of sorrow and long put-off mourning rolled down his cheeks . " There , that 's right , " Federigo said , " you are weeping , are n't you , Julian ? Tommy Burns is doing quite well , you 'll be glad to know , as a certified accountant in this city . He never married , though . Elaine Leonard , by the way , " he added , " has not yet been born . " Julian silently looked on at the scene below , watching the children playing in the shadow of the Old Fort which seemed to be also the shadow of futurity over them . " I 'm sorry , " he said , still weeping . " Oh , I am awfully sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remorse and regret ; when he opened them again the scene had faded . Itp224was night , the playground stretched out where the Old Reservoirhad been , but the Old Fort still stood on the rocks above . Julian turned to Federigo , but no one was there , and he had to find his way out of the Park alone . As he went home , with eyes still wet , he began to lose the sense of what he had felt ; secular considerations also obtrudedthemselves . Immense lengths of time seemed to have passed , Sylvia would have come home , she would be suspicious  --  unjustly , he cried in silence , unjustly  --  but there would be two glasses standing there because of that wretched drink he had made for Federigo . The silence of the house , and those two glasses , would surely betray him . " He is a devil , " said Julian of Federigo . " Only a devil could do such things as he did tonight . " And indeed it seemed as though Federigo must be a devil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill , since when Julian arrived home he found that practically no time had elapsed whatever , since Elaine 's departure . Sylvia had not returned from the movies , and two glasses , it was quite true , stood on the coffee table , but one of them bore distincttraces of lipstick . The Devil , thought Julian , as he washed the glasses . SYLVIA meanwhile , instead of going to the movies , was visiting with Marius in his room above the record shop , which was now , of course , quiet . It was an impromptu call , and not prearranged , she really had intended going to the movies , but when she arrived at the nearest theater she felt bored with the idea , in need of company , and rather resentful of Julianp225for being too tired to come with her ; also , now that the weddingwas over , her full , busy life seemed a little to have collapsedon her hands . Accordingly she decided that , as she had found no opportunity to tell Marius as yet the things she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time as any , so she phoned him and found him at home . It amused Sylvia , as with great poise she made herself comfortable facing Marius  --  she even sat boldly down on the bed  --  that the crucifix was not in sight on the opposite wall ; she wondered whether he had removed it permanently or merely taken it away for the period of her call . In any case , she did not refer to it . What she had come for , she said , was to talk to Marius sensibly . The substance of this sensible talk amounted to this , that Sylvia and Julian had been going through a critical time in their marriage  --  " the sort of thing that all married couples have to face sometime "  --  but that this time now was over . Anything Sylvia had said during that period , anything she had almost done , must be put down ( of course ) to her worry over the domestic situation ( which conditioned , said Marius to himself , her foreign policy )  --  she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as things will , righted themselves almost overnight ; Sylvia wanted no uncertainty to remain in Marius 's mind concerning her loyalty to her husband . " Of course , " she said lightly , " I should have been delighted to run away with you to some secret place for a mad weekend of delight  --  but you can see what my motive would have been , even then , I should only have been revenging myself on Julian . " " I see , " Marius said , trying to look properly glum and rejected , while in reality he was almost hugging himself withp226glee , as people will whose exclusive possession of knowledge lets them play for a moment the role of destiny in the affairs of others . " What about the anonymous letters ? " he casually inquired . As for the anonymous letters , Sylvia said , that was something she did not understand , nor yet  --  she supposed  --  did Julian . Marius raised his eyebrows practically to his hairline . Doubtless some person had thought it a good joke , though the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of humor ; at any rate , there had been no more letters for some time , and Sylvia , in her new security , very much doubted there would be any more . " We 've heard the last of Federigo , " she said , and added that she hoped Marius would do her the favor of forgetting he had ever heard of such communications , implying that she in return would never mention to anyone any confidences Marius had impartedto her on the subject of religious faith ( allowing her eyes to rest for a moment on the absence of the crucifix on the opposite wall ) . Of course , Sylvia concluded , she and Marius would remain good friends , and she would always be grateful for his having stood by her in the time of trouble . " Sylvia , " said Marius seriously , " supposing you should discover you are quite mistaken , and that the trouble is not over after all  --  imagine , for example , that Julian is actually deceiving you  --  what then ? " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  I thought that if he believed those ridiculous letters he might set out to show me that two could play at it  --  but I do n't really believe he would . He does love me , and he is not a hypocrite  --  and besides , where would he find the time ? I 'd undoubtedly know about it at once . " " Undoubtedly . But still , supposing . . . ? " " Why , then  --  " she laughed  --  " then , darling , I should  |p227fly  for refuge to your arms . I 'd leave him at once , " she added more seriously . At this moment the phone rang , and Marius , answering , was shocked to hear Julian at the other end ; it seemed impossiblethat neither he nor Sylvia could detect each other 's presence in the situation , and Marius believed at first that Julian must have known his wife would be here . Instead , however , it turned out that Julian , speaking in a rather troubled voice , wanted Marius 's help and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marius meet him for lunch next day ? " Yes , I suppose I could , " Marius replied . " What do you mean , a religious matter ? " " I want to ask you something , " Julian said seriously , " about the Devil  --  I thought you 'd be the only person I know who would have a , well , a professional qualification . . . " Marius , amazed , allowed Julian to set a time and place for their meeting , then hung up . " Just a fellow I know , " he said in response to Sylvia 's slight , questioning glance . " I did n't mean to pry into your life , " she quickly replied . Nevertheless , she then went on to tell him , speaking as the Older Woman , that she thought it was time he married and settled down . She mentioned the name of Elaine Leonard tentatively  --  " for instance . " " I hardly know her , " Marius said , adding with beautiful irony , " you know her much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , " Sylvia continued , " you would have to give up your way of living , you would have to take a job  --  " " But Elaine might not care to marry me , " he objected , " she may have in mind to marry quite another person . " They talked for a few minutes about Elaine , agreed she was a charming girl ; then Sylvia got up to leave.  | " Julian thinks I 'm at the movies , " she confessed , " and I must get back at about this time . " Marius saw her downstairs and even to the corner , where he got her a taxi . Sylvia had , more strongly than ever , the feeling of being watched ; but she did not think it right to involve Marius any further than she already had in the subjectiveproblems of her psyche . The matters of Dr. Thybold and Mr. Archer More , which had begun on the same day , the day of the first anonymous letter , as Julian recalled , settled themselves also on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got settled in the office when there came a phone call ; he heard a low , hoarse whisper at the other end . " This is Doctor you-know-who , " the whisper said . " Are you alone ? " " Doctor who ? " " Doctor  --  you know  --  lung cancer , " the voice mysteriouslywent on . " Oh , Thybold , " Julian cried , " what can I do for you ? " " You can please not mention my name , " said the doctor furiously . " Are you alone ? " " Yes . " " I 'm phoning from a pay station . I dare n't go home . " " You what ? " " I 've received an anonymous letter , " Dr. Thybold said in a quavering voice . " I 'm afraid the cigarette industry is after me . " " An anonymous letter ? " cried Julian in exasperation . " Oh , nonsense , doctor . You know perfectly well people do n't do that sort of thing these days . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have the letter right here , I 'll read it to you . "  |p229In  amazement Julian heard Dr. Thybold 's voice , with an appropriate dramatic ominousness , read the following mes-sage : It is not too late to mend . Retract your advertisement at once . Do not go to the police , you are being watched . If you go ahead with your plan consequences follow at once . You have been warned . " Is n't it signed at all ? " Julian asked . " It is signed , " said the doctor , " Nicotine the friend of man . ' " Julian controlled an impulse to laugh , not because it would be unseemly but because the laughter already felt hysterical in his throat . " What do you want me to do ? " " Burn the letters , " Dr. Thybold replied promptly . " I know when I 'm beaten , I ca n't fight the cigarette kings . " " But some of the letters have already gone out , " Julian objected . " Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer for your beliefs . " " Well , I gave up smoking , did n't I ? " Dr. Thybold demanded . " But this is serious . Look , I ca n't talk any longer . A man is watching me . Please do something . " And on this the phone went dead . Julian sat for a few minutesfeeling dazed , then gave instructions through Miss Duddonthat no more of Dr. Thybold 's circulars should be mailed until further notice . " There are two men here to see you , " said Miss Duddon , " a Mr. Archer More  --  he says you will remember  --  and friend . " " Send them in , " said Julian . Archer More was cold sober , and consequently looked frightful , with sagging cheels and dilated eyes so bloodshotp230the pupils were nearly obscured . His relation to the gentleman with him was that of a prisoner to a policeman ; the other man , holding him by the arm , pushed little Mr. More into the chair opposite Julian , but himself remained standing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded . " Just what outrage do you mean ? " Julian countered . " This this advertising campaign , " sneered the gentleman , " about love ! " " Nothing has been published yet , " Julian replied , " I have the copy here waiting for Mr. More 's approval . " " Mr. More will approve nothing , " decisively announced the other man . " I am Mr. More 's lawyer , my name is Henry Pratt , and I am delighted to be in time to prevent Mr. More from getting himself into serious trouble . " " The love of Christ Jesus , " said Mr. More faintly , " serious trouble . Martyrdom . My head hurts . " " You may take it as a definite order , " said Mr. Pratt , " that these advertisements are to be canceled  --  as of now . It is very fortunate that this got to my ears in time . " " I 'm afraid I do n't understand what this is all about , " Julian said . " The law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely you do n't imagine Mr. More has any right to go around spendinghis money , much less throwing it away ? Mr. More , sir , owes alimony to eleven women . These eleven women have eleven lawyers . If this nonsense about advertising became public these eleven lawyers would slap eleven injunctions against Mr. More before you could say  --  well , before you could say whatever you thought of saying . This gentleman , " the lawyer continued , " exists , you might say , in order to go on paying alimony to these eleven women . If he died , that would be perfectly all right , quife legal , because the estate would be split up among the eleven former wives ; if he married again ,  | " You mean you chose me to tell it to , " said Marius , " because you believe I am a credulous and superstitious im-becile ? " " No , really , " Julian assured him , " there 's no need to be offended . " " But after all , " Marius said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Meaning I am damned already ? " " Meaning at least , " Marius replied , " that it would not take any special concentration of effort on the part of His Sin-fulness . " " You know , " Julian said thoughtfully , " sometimes he seems to be a very nice fellow . " " Of course  --  I imagine his appearance wearing your face has predisposed you in his favor . I can only think , Julian , " Marius added , " that you have done something so dreadful you refuse to face it , and finally it has caught up with you ; the objective equivalent of your guilt is meeting you face to face . " " Oh  --  you think that ? " " I 've no way of knowing what it is , of course , " said Marius smugly . " Perhaps it 's an analyst you need , not a priest . You might have an interview with Sylvia 's man Mirabeau , who I believe is very hot on subjective impressions and fantasies and all that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he concluded helpfully . " I thought you might be able to tell me something , " said Julian , " but never mind . I hope you wo n't mention this discussionto anyone ? " " The only advice I can give you , " Marius said , " is , Be good and it will go away . As for your secret , it 's safe with me  --  I shall be as the tomb , as the tombs of Egypt . " He was unable to resist this final flourish , which he thought he had put inp234very aptly , and watched with a bland smile Julian 's suspicious glance get nowhere and disappear . Reflecting on this interview , Marius did not come explicitly to the conclusion that Julian had written those letters himself ; nevertheless , he now decided upon his course of action , which struck him as villainous but irresistibly to the point : the lettershad gone one way so far , now let them go the other way . As he sat at his desk , occupied in the unfamiliar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Historyof Ideas and pasting them together , he smiled sourly , havingthought of a charming parallel from history ; when the young Louis XIV wished to impress Mlle. de la Valliere , he engaged M. le Marquis de Dangeau , a witty and eloquent man , to write his letters to her ; the lady , duly impressed , thought herself insufficiently educated to write a proper reply , and in her turn engaged M. de Dangeau to write her letter to the King . Not a parallel , perhaps , perhaps a bit oblique , but at any rate ( thought Marius ) it must have been extremely amusingfor M. le Marquis de Dangeau . After what Marius had said , Julian was more confused than ever , and it seemed the mere operation of fate that Dr. Mirabeaushould call him up at the office during the afternoon . " Is your wife quite well ? " asked the voice , after introducingitself . " I suppose so , " Julian said doubtfully . " Why should n't she be ? " " Well , she has skipped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial session . " " Oh , I see . " " And I wondered if it would not be wise for you and me to have a little talk about the situation ? " Somewhat numbly , Julian heard himself agree to a timep235late in the afternoon ; it was with considerable nervousness , never having before been to a mind-doctor ( as he put it ) that he presented himself at Dr. Mirabeau 's office . Not being a patient ( not being a patient as yet , Dr. Mirabeau'sattitude proclaimed ) Julian was not required to lie on the couch but sat facing the doctor across the desk ; neverthelessthe atmosphere was hypnotic and mystifying , all the room being darkened save for the single circle of light in which their four hands rested on the blotter , and Julian could see out of the corner of his eye the couch of which one heard so much and which gained , although an ordinary enough piece of furniture , something of the technical , scary mystery of medical equipment generally . " To bring you up to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a question of anonymous letters  --  I take it you did actually get to see these letters ? " " Yes , I did , " said Julian noncommittally . " Ah . Now I must say that I at first made a mistake , a quite natural mistake . Mrs. Ghent did not actually bring the letter , the physical piece of paper , here to the office . From the way in which she spoke of it , I naturally concluded she had dreamed the whole improbable event , and she came in the course of the session to agree with me . " But then , " said the doctor impressively , " there came a second letter , and this one she brought to me . Of course I saw where I had gone wrong at once . " " You did ? " " Yes . For reasons which we need not go into , technical reasons having to do with the analysis , it became quite clear that Mrs. Ghent had written this letter at least , possibly the previous one if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were two . " " Yes  --  had written them , as I say , herself . Now , Mr.p236Ghent , it may be  --  none of us is perfect  --  that I made a furthererror here , a serious one , by treating your wife 's relation with me as her primary motive in these communications . It occurs to me now that if that had been so she need never have brought you into it at all . But as you can testify yourself to the existence of these letters , it strikes me now that their major object was not merely an effect of the transference ( which secondarily it was nevertheless designed to strengthen ) but their major object was to involve you , to focus your interest and attention on whatever Sylvia  --  Mrs. Ghent  --  had done or was about to do . " Now , Mr. Ghent , what I want you to tell me , in perfect confidence , as speaking to your own medical adviser , is thisis your wife faithful to you or not ? That is , has she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaimed in the letters ? " " I do n't know , " replied Julian , " but I have reason to think not . " " Reason ? " " Detectives . I was , of , course , bothered by those letters . " " Naturally , one would be bothered . " " Naturally . " " And you think there 's nothing to it ? " " No . " " Ah , " said Dr. Mirabeau , " I was afraid of that . It makes our problem more acute . " So this was psychoanalysis . Julian already had an impulse to confess everything , but he manfully resisted , though the sweat began to break out on his brow . He wondered , as though from a great distance , whether he would go with Elaine for the weekend at Lantern Point , and , if so , what excuse he would make to Sylvia . " More acute , " Dr. Mirabeau continued , " because , you see ,  |p237if  she had in fact been unfaithful to you  --  these things do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at least some connection with ordinary reality . As it is "  --  shaking his head sadly in the gloom back of the lamplight  --  " as it is , I must tell you that Mrs. Ghent is showing a detachment from the world , an apathy toward the daylight so to say , which I find professionally frightening . It suggests , even , incipient schizophrenia . And her refusal to return here after our last session seems , does it not , to support that judgment ? She simply wo n't face up to the reality of her situation . " " No , " said Julian simply in order to agree ; he scarcely knew what he was assenting to , and only wanted to get out in the fresh air . " Now I can not force her to come back , " said Dr. Mirabeau , spreading his hands in a gesture of easy helplessness , " but just there I think you might be able to help , if you are willing . Pick a time when she seems in a good , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , do not appeal to her emotions or become emotional yourself  --  be rational . In such cases as these , we frequently find , the emotions are curiously unin-volved , stubbornly remote , while the reason itself is extremely susceptible of conviction , it follows and assents to even most ridiculous chains of evidence simply because they have the appearance of being rational rather than emotive . It is an odd condition in which , you might say , the loss of reason presents a symptomatic appearance which is more reasonable than reason itself , the patient will spend long hours analyzing causes , motives , and so forth . Do you see ? " Julian said he saw , and upon his promise of co-operation , over a manly handshake , was permitted to depart . In another moment , he thought , his head might have left his neck and gone spinning skyward , gently and slowly , like those children'sballoons he had seen at the Zoo in Central Park.  |p238FEDERIGO  's third letter , which arrived in the morning mail Friday , outwardly resembled the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Julian but to Sylvia . Julian , who the previous evening had told his wife that he would have to spend the weekend in Philadelphia ( why Philadelphia ? He did not know ) where the firm was planning to open an agency , and who accordingly would phone Elaine later in the morning to say he was going with her , did not even notice the arrival of this letter or Sylvia 's reception of it , because he was engrossed in his own mail . This included a report from Mr. Bilsiter 's office , that on the other night , when he had entertainedElaine and , later , Federigo , when that odd thing had happened in Central Park , Sylvia had been not at the movies but with Marius Rathlin , at his apartment . So ! he was thinking , at just the moment that Sylvia opened her letter , so there is something in it after all . How fortunate that he had not called off those detectives . In order to keep the savor of his triumphant secrecy he looked at his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for her , pity and contempt  --  how secure she must imagine herself !  --  and , for himself , justification . Everything , complex as it was , had worked out ; the idea of the anonymous letters finally justifieditself in the only way possible , by being right , by referringto a real situation ; his going away with Elaine Leonard likewise justified itself by means of what these letters brought to light . Sylvia looked up from her letter , and said in a neutral  |p239voice  , " Why do n't I walk the dogs this morning , darling , and you finish your coffee ? " " Of course , anything you say , " Julian replied . Their eyes , however , did not meet . And when Sylvia had got dressed and put Troilus and Cressida on their leashes and left the apartment , the letter was prominently displayed on the table where Julian must presently see it . Sylvia , with a grim expression on her face , immediately walked the dogs to the nearest drugstore , where she telephoned to Marius . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left open and the dogs kept trying to drag her out of the phone booth . She could see it all now , of course ; and the worst thing in it , perhaps , was her own blindness and ridiculous sense of security , the feeling that the anonymous letters were past and gone , love re-established ( when really it had been an armed truce ) and life ready to go on in the normal way . She imagined Julian and Elaine laughing at her , and this idea horrified her so much that she could scarcely speak when Marius answered the phone . He , having expected this result , had difficulty in sounding properly surprised , and then a more unexpected difficulty in sounding properly gratified , when it turned out that Sylvia would go away with him that very day , that she knew the place where they would go , that she realized ( as she did not , in her extremity , fail to remind him ) that he loved her whateverhappened , and that she was coming at once to his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting , and had to allow that he did not . " Still , " he said , " it will be charming  --  if only it can be kept that way . " Sylvia in twenty minutes appeared , dragging the dogs upstairs.  | " Queen and huntress chaste and fair , " elegantly said Marius , for whom it was perhaps never too early in the morning . " Listen to me , " she said breathlessly , " and do n't be silly . Listen  --  Marius , do you love me ? " " Of course , darling , " he said lightly , and put his arms around her , " you know that . " Sylvia , however , having received this assurance , backed away and drew from her handbag a single key , which she presented to him . He stared at it doubtfully . " It is the key to Hugo 's place out at Lantern Point . We 'll go there  --  it 's lonely and beautiful . Marius  --  I want you to go out there first and wait for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go home to pack , and "  --  grimly  --  " have words with my wretched husband . " " This is all so sudden , " said Marius . " What 's happened between you two ? " " Oh , I 'll tell you later , when I get out there . It was Elaine , all that time  --  do you know , he 's actually going to Philadelphiawith her , on business ; he told me he was going to Philadelphia on business , and I believed it . Then , this morning , that letter came  --  I 'll give him business ! " " Sylvia , " Marius said , " are you going with me for love or revenge ? " This brought her to a stop for a moment . " You do n't know how it 's made me feel , " she said , " how horrible , how dirty it is . " " Ah , there , " he said to comfort her , and put his arm round her shoulder . " But it 's not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you , truly it is . " " Of course , " he said . The dogs had by now twisted the leashes quite around them both.  | " Marius , it will be fun , " she whispered . " But promise  --  I do n't know , I 'm still ashamed  --  promise it will be dark , and without saying anything . " " I promise , " he gravely assured her . " In darkness , silently  --  like strangers . " " Silently , like two strangers in the night . " Julian meanwhile had called Elaine . " I was just about to leave , " she said . " Are you coming ? " " Yes , " he said into the cold phone . " Yes , darling . " " You 'd better get over here in five minutes , then . " " Oh , " he said . " I could n't leave so soon . I 'm not packed , and really I 'd better be at the office during the day  --  Sylvia'sgot the idea I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , you clever lad , " said Elaine , without admiration . " Imagine thinking up a thing like that . " " Darling , do n't  --  I love you , darling . Let me drive out , I 'll be there and meet you by early evening . " " You know , dear , I doubt you will , " was the reply . " I think you 'll back out at the last moment . But it 's your picnic . I 'll be there , and if you are not , that 's the end . Understood ? " " I love you , " said Julian into the phone which had gone dead . Nervously he walked about for a few moments , went to the dining room table and poured himself more coffee . So it was all going to come true at last ! At this moment his eye fell on the letter , which so exactly resembled in appearance the ones of his own composition . With shaking hands he opened it and was shocked to read : MADAME : Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid . . . ? FEDERIGO  |p242For  a moment Julian was capable of only one thought : I never wrote that . He sat down and looked incredulously at the letter , as though expecting it to dissolve in his hands and be no more . This was what it felt like to receive an anonymous letter ; just so Sylvia must have felt . Reality had spoken . At this moment Sylvia returned . " So ! " she said , upon seeing the letter in Julian 's hands . " So ! " replied Julian , but less dramatically . Because they were both highly moral , or moralistic , persons , an argument necessarily had to take place . This argumentbecame passionate at times , at times bitter , at times , also , ridiculous ( there was a passage of debate about who was to take the car , the dogs , et cetera ) ; but this argument was on both sides corrupted by secrecy at the root , and by the uncertainties of desire , so that very little truth resulted from it . Julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being caught out ; the entire escapade with Elaine was by this means wrought up  --  a little hysterically  --  into honesty , he was no longer skulking behind Sylvia 's back , everything was now brought out in the light of day ( except , of course , the letters ) . And Sylvia in the same way-felt a certain relief ; it was now possible to have an affair without betraying anyone ; she told Julian she was leaving him , what she did after that would naturally be her own business . Beneath their disagreeable tones , beneath the real but imperfectly apprehended consternationover parting , both were experiencing the same furtivejubilation , the random feeling of freedom and emptiness together ; it is also likely that neither believed their separation would be permanent . She loves me , after all , thought Julian . When she returns things will be as I wish . And he pictured himself as planning rationally with a much-chastened Sylvia the modern marriage ,  |p243marked  by occasional light infidelities , which would exactly suit his requirement . He ca n't live without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to heel , after a few days , I shall outline exactly what can be permitted and what can not . There were tears , a few , on her side ; sullen gloom on his . At last they subsided into a kind of sad rationality ( like civilizedpeople , as Julian stuffily said ) and Sylvia began to pack . Perhaps their closest appreciation of what was really happeningcame when they accidentally began to talk about their possessions . " Since I 'm the one who 's leaving , " Sylvia said , " I should have the car . " " I 'm sorry , " he replied . " I need the car , and besides it is registered in my name . " " I said I want the car . " " And if you take it , I shall report to the police that it has been stolen ; instead , I give you all the furniture "  --  with a large gesture . " I 'll put that in writing . " " What do I want with all the furniture  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The money in the bank belongs to you as much as to me . I ca n't stop you from buying another car  --  I regret to say . " " All right , but one thing I insist on  --  if I have n't the car , you must take the dogs . " " I do n't want the dogs , " said Julian . " I 've never wanted the dogs . Hugo gave them to you , really . " " Hugo gave them to both of us , for a wedding present . " " And I know why , " said Julian with a sour smile . It was decided upon this that if Julian had the convenience of the car he should also undertake the inconvenience of the dogs , who at this moment were walking aimlessly around thep244apartment trailing their leashes which had not been removed . " Where will you be , if I should have to get in touch with you ? " Julian asked Sylvia . He had determined not to be the first to ask , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a decisive silence , he gave in . " I do n't see that is any of your business , " she replied . " I wo n't be hiding , I assure you . You can find me if you want me badly enough . " " That 's not what I meant at all , " he said heatedly . " I meant , to arrange about the separation  --  lawyers , and so forth . " Neither Julian nor Sylvia had ever had any extensive dealingswith the world of litigation and the courts ; even the word " lawyer " frightened them both a good deal . " We 'll settle all that another time , " Sylvia said . " But meanwhile , I think we ought to agree on one thing . " " And that is ? " " That neither of us will draw out all the money in the currentaccount , or deliberately spend an extraordinary lot just to inconvenience the other . " " Well  --  I wo n't if you wo n't , " Julian agreed . " But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sylvia said with excessive sweetness , " do n't set up your precious little whore in the Plaza . Find her a cold-water flat , or let her live here so long as she does n't use my furniture . " Sylvia perhaps would have had a good deal more to say on this theme , once started ; on the other hand , a better exit might be hard to find , and consequently the door slammed with dramatic finality on the word furniture . As soon as his wife had gone Julian phoned Elaine , but found she had already left . He then phoned Mr. Bilsiter of the detective agency , whom he informed of what had happened.  | " You suspect she is going to Mr. Rathlin , yes , " said Mr. Bilsiter patiently , " and you want evidence , yes , of course . It shall be done , I 'll see to it myself if possible . Now tell me Mr. Ghent , do you want us to phone you  --  quite plainly , do you want to be in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " Well , some do and some do n't , " said Mr. Bilsiter carelessly . " I merely meant , " Julian added , " that I shall be away myselfthis weekend . You may simply send the results here to me by mail , as you did the reports . " " You shall have them , sir , if they are there to be had , " Mr. Bilsiter promised . " Testimony and , to clinch it , photographs . " This last , which had not occurred to Julian , horrified him ; he imagined himself staring , under Mr. Bilsiter 's gaze , at a flashlight picture of his wife in bed with Marius Rathlin , and he shuddered . When one thought of it that way , the whole business took on a quite loathsome reality . But while he was shuddering , Mr. Bilsiter had said good-by and hung up . Now there was no one left to phone . There was no one left . Julian had the apartment , save for the two dogs he did not like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , he would be with Elaine , and time would resume ; but he stood now in an abscessin time where there existed only , it appeared , the fact of his being alone . He walked slowly but nervously around the room ; the dogs walked around the room their leashes rattlingon the legs of tables and chairs . Exasperated , Julian unsnappedthe leashes , collared the dogs and locked them in the hall bathroom , turning on the light because they were afraid of the dark and whimpered if left that way . Now he felt more alone than ever , and confronted by the monstrosity of his nature . The accusations of the world were one thing , and occasionedmere secular anxieties ; but the accusations fromp246within , being inescapable , had a religious and exalted character , so that before he knew it he was pacing up and down like an orator on a platform . The curtains were still drawn over the windows , for Sylvia had not pulled them back . Julian remembered reading that in a closed room one could have no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sudden access of anxiety he strode over and drew back the curtains ; it was a gray , rather misty day , but the world , or at least this street of it , perceptibly existed . An early fly crawled on the window pane and flew against it buzzing ; for no other reason than that he felt miserable and full of guilt Julian devoted some time and attention to pinning this fly against the corner of the frame and squashing it . In disgust he rubbed its small black remains , with a little red blood ( Sylvia 's ? ) from his finger . Of course , the poor thing ( he thought ) had not suffered , there had not been time . But he could not , on consideration , admit this comfortable notion , for , how could he know what time might be to a fly ? Perhaps that instant , in which his fat finger had descended on its life , had amounted , when gauged in fly-time , to some six weeks in agony in a hospital with , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ? In the bathroom , with the lights on , the dogs whimpered even so , and Julian walked the empty apartment . The world went around , and he with it . His nearest evidenceat this moment of the world 's ( and his ) incessantly going around was the electric clock on the bedside table ( he had wandered into the bedroom and stood abstractedly regarding the unmade beds ) . This clock read about a quarter to eleven and emitted a light , humming tone which he had alwaystaken to be the domestic image and idol of the power behind the world going remorselessly about its interminable business . This clock was a machine more mighty , sacred andp247dreadful than any rosary , for example , or prayer wheel of the Buddhist ; under the appearance of an innocent , convenient recording device it exercised an absolute compulsion upon the waywardness of life ; at this very moment , while he watched , it was going about its work of making him older , even while with the same three hands it brought some into the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea and that one late for a plane in which he would have been destroyed . Everyone in society , it would be not too much to say , possessed a clock , or was possessed by one ; portable models were also available , and their association with strap or chain was not accidental , for did they not everywhere demonstrate servitude ? ( Julian was reminded that he no longer had a watch ; also that so far as marriage was concerned he had , more or less , his freedom ; these observations failed somehow to impress him favorably . ) He sighed , he was alone . Sylvia 's photograph on the dresser followed him with eyes of a terrible and accusing candor as he guiltily left that room . The living room was of course no improvement , for there again was the portrait of Sylvia which he himself , Julian , had caused to be done , a long time ago , by a young artist who , for all the appealing expression he had caught , or put , in the face , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swivel mountings . Was there not , he asked himself as he went on through to the kitchen , something morbid , something **26;7728;TOOLONG , in this making of images ? Did it not  --  by its intention of preserving the past  --  give away the selfishness beneath its tender pretense ? as in the anecdote which Marius had told him as coming from , of all people , Sigmund Freud , of a young man who sighingly remarked to his pretty wife , " Do you know , my dear , if either of us should die I think I would live in Paris ? " But if some such wish layp248concealed in the black inward of the camera , in the mind which set the painter on about his business , the eyes took their revenge . " I know what you are thinking , " was their word whatever one was thinking , and whatever one was thinking when suddenly made aware of the eyes , they were right , or at any rate convincing . In the kitchen , where he went without any clear idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subtle hum of the refrigerator , the domestic imitation of silence . Another emblem , this , of the power streaming ceaselessly through all things , the violent fluidity which itself enabled the world to look relatively solid and stable . He opened the door and stared objectlessly into the cold , lighted box , which contained a neat and sparing arrangement of foods , none of them at this momentvery interesting to him : a package of bacon , a box of eggs , a bottle of milk which was paradoxically of all things in the world the coldest-looking and most forbidding ; a thin , tall bottle of Niersteiner , and this he doubtfully reached for , held to the light , began to return to its place , and finally put down on the drainboard of the sink . This move brought him face to face with another electric clock : eight minutes to eleven . The sweep second hand moved with a dreadful smoothness . There were sixty seconds in each minute , thirty-six hundred in each hour , thirty-six times twenty-four was already incalculablewithout pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred and sixty-five would be a staggering figure whatever it was , and , finally , that times an indeterminable ( at present ) number put by some authorities at seventy would be , leaving leap years out of consideration , the enormousnumber of seconds involved in measuring out a long human life , if anyone wanted to know . Julian observed with a sense of irritated anxiety that this problem had already costp249him some fifty seconds in the computing ; moreover , about half his hypothetical number of seconds had already been used up . Of course , he might become a centenarian , or he might fall down dead in , say , twelve more minutes . The first possibility was statistically unlikely , the second did not seem probable under the circumstances unless he killed himself , which he now realized was what he had been thinking of doing . He poured the wine into a squat , ordinary kitchen glass and returned with bottle and glass to the living room , where he sat down on the couch before the ornamental , empty fireplace . The eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over her cheekbones , at the top of his head . It was almost with gratitude that he saw , a few minutes later , Federigo standing rather shyly in the corner of the room , as though he had come through the door only a moment ago . Nevertheless , he put up a show of anger , and said : " You had to send that letter , did n't you ? I hope you 're pleased . " " Ah , darling , I did n't send it , " Federigo said , smiling . " Do n't call me darling , please , " said Julian fiercely and with a surprising blush . " I did n't send it , " Federigo repeated , " and yet , you know , I thought you rather wanted some such thing to happen . It 's been at the back of your mind for a few days , has n't it , that the next thing on the program was to get caught off base , somehow-anyhow ? Are you quite sure , " he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the others ? You might have made it up and mailed it and then forgotten . " " No , " said Julian , nearly in a shout . " That 's ridiculous . You did it , you must have done it . " " I do n't do things , " said Federigo with a kind of disdainful diginity . " If I had , believe me I should have chosen a differ/ent quotation from Lord Tennyson  --  whose reputation , I believe , is going up these days : His honour rooted in dishonour stood , And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true . Practically metaphysical , is n't it , with all that back and forth in the words ; confusing . " " It 's obvious you did it , " cried Julian . " You knew it was Tennyson . " " They 're very well-known lines , " said Federigo evasively . " Still , that 's not here nor there . The point is , what next ? " " I do n't know , " Julian sullenly replied . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elaine ? Kill yourself ? Take a world cruise ? Live elsewhere under a new name ? Redeem yourself by missionary work in a malarial swamp ? " Federigo presented these alternatives , if that is what they were , rapidly and in a neutral voice , adding in conclusion , " How far can you go by Ferris wheel ? " " I 'm going to Elaine , " Julian said . " After that  --  we 'll see . " Spoken like a little man , " said Federigo . " As for myself , I 'm delighted to see you do something straightforward . I 'm sure it will work out for the best  --  so sure , " he added , " that I 've come to say good-by . " " You are leaving me ? Now ? " " It 's what you wanted , is n't it ? " Federigo approached Juliancasually , and before the latter was aware of his intention , heartily and disgustingly kissed him on the mouth , then quickly backed away toward the bedroom , with Julian angrily following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , " said Federigo ,  |p251|pretending  to be unaware of Julian 's fierce expression ; and he disappeared , leaving Julian to walk up and down the floor until his exasperation lapsed in moody inattention and sullenness . He must have remained in this state for some minutes ; he was never certain whether he had heard the toilet flush or not , but when he finally knocked on the bathroom door and then , hearing no answer , opened it , his strange companion was nowhere to be found . " He must have slipped out while my back was turned , " Julian decided as he packed an overnight case . His last action before leaving the house was to open half a dozen cans of horse meat , which he disposed at various points about the house , so that the dogs , liberated from the other bathroom , should not starve . But the image of them prowling the lonely rooms , and perhaps a certain vivid reminiscence of the smell of horse meat , remained with him all the day and night in resentment and reproach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lantern Point jutted into the Atlantic ; it was a desolate , haunted kind of country on the best of days , a land of shifting dunes and twisted , stunted pines , and today a thick fog from the sea rolled cold and gray over it all ; out here , on a knoll which doubtless in good visibility overlooked the water  --  one could hear the waves through the fog  --  Hugo Alter 's house stood alone . Marius received directions at the station and decided , as he had plenty of time and not much money , to walk out ; he investeda small sum , however , in provisions , reminding him/self that even adultery marches on its stomach . The sand road off the highway was clearly marked , and the distance from there only about a mile ; even despite the fog Marius became quite cheerful as he swung along carrying a bag in which were eggs and sausages and coffee and bread there was a kind of biblical and ancient freedom about his having suddenly entered , only a couple of hours from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , on his entrance into the house . In the first place , the front door was not only not locked , it stood open ; nothing could more have resembled a trap . Marius imagined that a party of tramps , escapedcriminals , madmen , might have taken advantage of the loneliness of the place to hide out here . He reconnoitered , listenedat the door , heard nothing , then at last took his courage and stepped inside . Here it was very gloomy and cold , not only from the character of the day but because the windows were boarded up ; the very air had that refrigerated stillness and staleness which suggested the tomb , the whitewashed walls were bare and dismal , one of them bore a calendar which had not been turned since February . It was the kitchen he had entered on , and here he stood for several minutes , while his hands and feet grew cold , looking at the black iron bulk of the wood stove and thinking that he ought to get busy at once cutting some kindling and lighting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unable to move . There was no doubt at all in his mind that Sylvia was a foolish woman ; surely they could have arrangedsomething , more sensible than this ? He himself would not have wanted a hotel room , for hotel rooms seemed to him , for such purposes as this , like re-usable coffins but what in heaven 's name would have been wrong with his own room , poor but centrally heated , and with the blessing of electricity ?  |p253Marius  imagined how cold it would be in this house come night , and how utterly , utterly dark  --  how desolate . " I have my love to keep me warm , " he murmured sullenly . At this moment he heard a noise , a kind of scratching and dragging , from another room . He stood as if petrified . Human beings ? Mice ? He decided finally on mice , but the idea did not much comfort him . The noises began again  --  he imaginedmice five or six feet high  --  then resolved into footsteps ; a door swung toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment of astonishment , neither spoke , for each determined not to be the first to show surprise ( nil admirari , Marius told himself proudly ; one so seldom met situations surprisingenough to let this motto be serviceable ) , and at the end of this moment each was ready with a clever remark . " Dr. Livingstone , I presume ? " said Elaine . " A small world , is it not ? " said Marius . " You are aware , I guess , that this is private property ? " " I just happened to be passing by , and thought I 'd drop in . " Another silence followed , then Elaine said : " While you 're here , you 'll find some kindling in the shed round the corner to the right as you go out ; also an ax and some logs . H you will first bring the kindling and then go off rail-splitting , I 'll try to see that we do n't freeze to death . " Marius did as he was told , with some difficulty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunk of wood , down on his toe , but without serious harm since he had already got too tired to hit very hard . He also , at Elaine 's instruction , pumped water up from the well . In half an hour or so they had the kitchen warming up to a reasonable temperature and had even made coffee . During this time they scarcely spoke ; each was wondering what was to be done with this odd situation . They drank coffee and smoked cigarettes ; the kitchen was quitep254cozy , and ( thought Marius ) as full of suspicious tension as it would have been had they been married and living there for months . " I could have the police come over and get you out of here , " Elaine observed in a highly theoretical tone , not moving from her chair . " Is n't that sort of elaborate ? " he asked , as though also prepared to theorize . " There 's no phone , you 'd have to walk down to the village  --  I mean , you could hardly send me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably you could persuade me to leave  --  but I wonder if there is n't a better way ? " " I wonder , " said Elaine , and a moment later proposed they take a walk on the shore . " I am afraid , " she said , " we are going to have to explain ourselves , or each other , somehow . " Down on the shore , below the dunes , the fog was close and cold about them . The waves washed with a sound of sandpaperat their left as they walked along ; it was possible to see barely twenty feet out on the black calm of the water and the breaking white of the small waves ; not even a bird cried in the calm . " Like the beginning of the world , " she said . " Or the end of it , " said Marius , feeling however that this was not so much a difference as an agreement between them . He boldly took her hand , which she did not remove , and they dawdled slowly down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you love him ? " Marius presently asked ; Elaine looked up at him and grinned . " You seem to know a great deal , " she said . " But , as I told you the other day  --  no , I do n't . This was designed , sort of hopelessly , for pleasure . And you  --  you followed me out here , I guess ? "  |p255Well  , as a matter of fact  --  no , " Marius said . " You see , " he began to explain , " we seem to have got hooked up on the same circuit . Sylvia 's coming down , too . " " Oh , my God , " Elaine said . " And he told her he was going to Philadelphia on business . " After considering this for a moment , she began to laugh . " I think you could n't have heard the latest , " said Marius . " The Philadelphia version has been seen through  --  your friend Federigo , " he added with conscious malice , " has struck again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylviathat morning , reporting the text of the letter as if she had told it him but not by any means admitting his fateful role in the business . " Elaine the fair , Elaine the loveable , " he said , partly to see her blush and partly for the pleasure simply of saying this to her , " Elaine the lily maid and there , with a question mark , it ends . " " It does , does it ? " " Yes , and I very much fear that in the sequel the Ghents have broken up . At least , " Marius added , " Sylvia gave me that impression this morning . " " So that Julian , when he gets here , if I know Julian , will be desperate with love . Oh , dear , " Elaine sighed . " With large , moony eyes and a serious expression and talk about honesty and wanting to marry me to make everything all right again . Oh , dear . " " I think , " said Marius , " that Sylvia has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning that love alone would save everything  --  it also seemed , and this was not so nice , as if she was retreating on prepared positions , and I was to be the prepared positions . " " You mean she arranged this with you before she broke up with him ? " " I am afraid there was this element of calculation in it , "  |p256Marius  said . " But it did n't seem right for me to back out just then . " " Oh , dear , " Elaine said once again . " Do you suppose it is marriage makes people like that  --  or are they that way to begin with ? " " Maybe they get married because they are like that , " said Marius . " Of course , you led her on , " she said . " That was wicked , was n't it ? " " Let not the pot and the kettle begin slanging one another , " Marius reminded her . " You are here , too , you know . " They became aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them on the sand lay a big , dead fish with a huge head of which the lower jaw protruded in a kind of grin studded with sharp , uneven teeth . Flies flew about intensely buzzing , violent with black life in the midst of the calm of the fog . On seeing this sight they both turned in silent agreement to walk back the way they had come , and as they turned Mariustook Elaine by the shoulders and kissed her , with consent . Then , hand in hand once more , they walked away . " What 's to be done ? " he asked . " We might simply run away , " said Elaine . " After all , if this is funny for us , think how it will be for them to find each other here . " " Yes , " Marius agreed . " Quite literally , the bonds of matri-mony . " " Are we , do you think , wicked people , you and I ? " Elaine asked . " Or are we only younger and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " Marius replied . " I suspect we 're wicked enough to live . Probably it would be best to run away  --  that is , you 're not dead set on meeting him , are you ? " " No , " said Elaine , " I think I could live without . " " I feel the same way about her . "  |p257They  walked in silence for some minutes . When they had almost reached the break in the dunes which led to the house , Marius said : " There is another way , you know . It 's difficult , and it 's devious , but ' it has a certain decisive charm as we are , you and I , difficult and devious persons . As I imagine it now , things would go roughly like this . . . " H UMAN actions , of course , are natural and realistic  --  or are they ? The things which take place in our lives take place from , we presume , the more or less accidental complicity of purpose and accident ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over us , or we may believe the result to be consequent on our own rational cleverness , or we may believe things happen mostly by chance . In any case , we seldom and only under special conditions  --  ranging in kind from jokes to tragedies  --  believe our actions , which so resembleproducts of freedom and the free operation of our wills , are in fact compelled , ourselves all ignorant , by other human wills ; and if we believe it seldom , we never believe it willingly . Such things have to be forced upon our notice : a man moving across an open field , under the open sky , naturallyrefuses to believe he is moving through a dark , narrow tunnel from which there is no escape ; yet frequently , so far as his will is concerned , the latter is the more accurate version . What Sylvia saw , what Julian saw , what they saw who watched behind the scenes , or knowingly and with a charmed sense of power acted a part upon the scene  --  as a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater part of the action was acted after dark , Marius and Elaine had hidden all butp258one lantern in order to simplify the plot , and this darkness , it ought to be remembered , was the darkness that was before electricity , the divine and awful darkness which people who live in cities experience only in the midst of a war , and which they otherwise tend to forget about , telling themselves ( if they think of it at all ) that it could not be , really , so terribly dark  --  but , of course , it is . Already when Julian came on the scene , in the late afternoon , he had the headlights on , mostly because of the fog  --  but the fog seemed to bring the night down earlier . As he stepped from the car he saw Elaine emerge from , oddly enough , not the house but a clump of trees . She greeted him with a kiss , and he began to feel better , a little , than he had at any time since early morning . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that he returned her kiss , thinking dismally that he felt , absolutely and physically felt , that he was being watched , probably by Sylvia , absurd as it was to think so . He wondered where she was . While Elaine led Julian into the house  --  he proudly showed her the bottle of whisky which he had been sensible enough to bring  --  Marius dutifully trudged back to the villageof Lantern , where he met Sylvia , who arrived on the only train it had been possible for her to get , the last one of the afternoon . " Oh , dear God , " she thought miserably as she stepped down on the platform and saw her lover , " dear God , this is really happening . My marriage is over , seven years are gone , now I am doing this . " She embraced Marius with considerable fervorin order to conceal this feeling , and at this sight Mr. Bilsiter , standing in the vestibule and preparing to dismount with two cameras and a black valise , turned to smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told Sylvia , that it would be best to dine in the village , which they accordingly did . Marius was tender , charming , even rather sentimental than witty ; also , he paid the check . Sylvia began to feel somewhat more secure , though this probably was as much as anything a result of having dinner . She felt also , and accordingly , as though she had arrived at the end of a road ; this , whatever it turned out to be , was the place of decision ; and she was free for the first time in days of that annoying sensation of being followed . From time to time , however , she wondered bitterly about Julianand his Elaine in Philadelphia  --  how could he , knowing that she knew , go on with such a thing ? Elaine , carefully watching the time , cooked Julian a thin sort of supper , with which , however  --  or more likely with the mere spectacle of her domesticity  --  he was charmed . She then insisted on making him go for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said to him : " Julian , please promise me , when you come to me tonight , it will be dark , and you wo n't speak ? " Julian expressed surprise . " Please , darling , let it be that way . I am not so used to these things , " Elaine added , " as you are . " This unlooked-for hint of innocence  --  and indeed , Elaine seemed , out here in the lonely wilderness beside the sea , less sophisticated than he had thought  --  quite charmed Julian , who tenderly promised they should be silent . " There is a dead fish somewhere about , " he said , sniffing . " Let us turn back . " He kissed Elaine as they turned , and had the weather been much warmer a complication might at this point have developed in the scheme ; as it was , however , they slowly walked back toward the house , where Marius and Sylvia , a few minutes before , had arrived by means of the singlep231that would be perfectly all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could support another wife without renegingon the alimony payments . Mr. More , " he concluded , " is neither more nor less than the living result of his actions , and he must take the consequences . That is all there is to it . Your firm , sir , may put in a bill for whatever expense this business has put you to ; if it is reasonable , it will be paid . If it is not reasonable , you may go whistle for it . Good day . " The lawyer bodily pulled Mr. More to his feet ; Mr. More groaned , wobbled slightly , steadied . " Consider the lilies of the field , " he cried as he was more or less dragged through the door . These two crises , happening on the one morning , left Julian bemused by the idea that life was one grand theatrical performance . I live , he thought , in a world operated by Federigo ; and he began to think that the actions of Dr. Thybold and Mr. More had run their courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an obscure sense , as demonstration : Dr. Thybold in his silly way a moralist , wanting to reformthe world by works , and Mr. More in his silly way a mystic , wanting to redeem the world by advertising , which was after all a species of prayer . " And I too , " he reflected , " I wanted to change the nature of things , and I wrote anonymous letters . And now I do n't know whether I 'm coming or going . " This doubt whether he was coming or going formed the subject of his discussion with Marius Rathlin at lunch . Julian flattered himself that he conducted the inquiry at such a high theoretical level as to arouse no suspicion about his particular actions ; he mentioned no names , neither of Federigo nor of Elaine . The information which Marius already had , however , en/abled him to see rather more than Julian imagined he saw . He knew , for example , about the letters , and he knew that Federigoexactly resembled Julian . The only thing that badly puzzledhim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioning the anonymous letters , of course ) in such a way as made it seem this person could be no more than a hallucination , a Doppelganger in fact ; but Elaine had testified on the other hand  --  and if she were hallucinated , it would surely not be with this particular hallucination  --  to the real existence of a person with the odd name of Federigo , who , however , could not in her opinion be responsible for the letters , being away  --  and if that were true , neither could he be the person who haunted Julian . " You know the thing that troubles me most ? " Julian said . " It 's that I am not even frightened when he appears , not even surprised , really . Sometimes I get angry with him  --  but I ought to be terrified , is n't that right ? " " If you want my honest opinion , " Marius said , " it sounds more like incipient schizophrenia  --  you know the world is full of invisible enemies out for your blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hurt you , so as a result you 're not even frightened . " " Oh . " Julian took this information in reasonable calm , but was of course a little disconsolate . " You think I 'm going insane , then ? " " Well , I do n't exactly think so , " Marius said . " You behave all right , though you look sort of pale and tired . It 's not what I would think by myself , but it is certainly what is suggested by your story . " " But I chose you to tell it to , " Julian explained , " because you 're probably the only person I know at all well who real y believes in the Devil  --  your religion does require you to believe in the Devil , does n't it ? "  |p141If  he is unreal , I am going insane . The Devil of course did not exist , for if the Devil existed , then God would have to exist  --  but did that necessarily follow ? Or was it the Devil himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alone sponsored , criticized and assessedthe belief in a God ? So that God was the imagination of the Devil working on the world ? This line of speculation impressed Julian as at once ridiculous and too deep to be followed any further , he simply became confused . Besides , considered as a real , objectively existing Devil , Federigo appearedabsurd ; he did not have enough reality . Considered , on the other hand , as a subjective impression , he uncomfortably had too much ; if Julian tried to think of him that way , it seemed he had unquestionably been there , no getting around it . But he was not going insane ; he had read somewhere that the very thought one was going insane was one 's best guarantee against it ; insane people never believed they were . On the other hand , if it was only for that reason he believed he was not going insane , where did that take him ? Confusion again . The thought of insanity , however , fascinated him , it presented a way out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsound mind , therefore they were not his crimes . Of course , as his rigorously brought up mind had gathered from all its experience so far , this was a solution too glib for belief . On exactly the appropriate occasions , when one was ashamed , afraid , hoping somehow to avoid an onerousduty , one generally did not fall sick of consumption , break a leg , go raving mad , or simply explode into a thousand pieces ; one faced up , and went on facing up , to whatever was going at the time . If somewhere in this life tragedy existed , this perhaps was where it might be found , in the enduring painp142of responsibility which provided no such symbolic escape  --  in duty , shame , guilt , fear , without the alleviation of sickness , madness , death . To live a clean , honest life . . . Julian knew quite well , in theory , that human suffering , misery and degradation were everywhere around . Civilization , on the other hand , was organized to the end that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as possible confined and segregated , and dealt with by people who qualified as technicians with respect to misery , suffering and degradation and could , therefore , handle the tabooed objects without fear and without revulsion . Others , though , would do well to walk quietly and with their eyes to the front . The blind beggar on the street , the crippled and drunken Legionnaire in the subway , the woman vomiting in the gutter between two parked automobiles : to acknowledge such things was to ask for trouble , it was , for a member in good standing in civilization , slightly subversive , and smacked of making a fuss which was neither necessary nor justifiable ; even charity , when it was unofficial , became a political act . Julian remembered having once seen a dead man on the street , a window-cleaner fallen from his ledge . A crowd gatheredat a little distance . Women , with faces averted , went carefullyaround the body on clicking heels and continued on their ways . It had been beautifully delicate , the expression they unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which did not permit them , just at that instant , to look down . Nor had he himself done anything except feel an indescribable helplessness and lonely guilt , until a policemanand a doorman came running up , and the latter covered the body with a rubber mat taken from before the entrance of a building down the street . He thought now that the policeman and the doorman had been enabled to do this thing for no
