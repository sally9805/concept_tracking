txt RESIGNS IN BELGIUM Gaston Eyskens The New York Times ( London Bureau ) CABINETINBELGIUM QUIPS - 0N QUESTION OF RETURN OF KING Liberals in Coalition Regime , Cause Downfall by Holding to Pre-Vote Commitment BAR STEP TO END REGENCY , Prince Charles Consults With Party Leaders but Fails to Name a New Premier By SYDNEY GRUSON Special to MIN bans , YORK TThilt , BRUSSELS , Belgium , March 18 ? The Belgian Government headed by Gaston Eyskens fell today over the question of King Leopold 's return to , the throne . The Regent , Prince Charles , immediately began consultations with party leaders on the formation of a new Cabinet but , testifying to his difficulties , he had failed to name a Premier designate by nightfall ' . Another period of great uncertainty lay ahead for the country , it was agreed . The Liberals , holding the balance of power in the Lower House , brought the Government down . After days of soul searching they made good their pre-referendum commitment to oppose the King 's return unless he got more than 50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's three areas in last . Sunday 's vote . The Xing won 57.68 per cent of the total votes but he failed to get a majority in Wallonia and Brussels . The Liberals told M. Eyskens at the Cabinet meeting this morning they could not assume respQnsibiliity for calling a joint session of the two Houses of Parliament as required to rescind the regency law and restore King Leopold . M. Eyskens ' party , the Social Christians ( Catholics ) , holds an over=all majority when both Houses sit togeth er , but is two short of a majority in the Lower House . Minority Rule Rejected Worried and weary after what he described as the " most grueling weeks " of his seven months in office , M. Eyskens took the Government 's resignations to the Regent straight from the Cabinet meeting . He was said to have refused to head an all-Catholic party minority administration , which , to survive its first meeting in the Lower House , would have to get the support of two or more of the chamber 's thirty Liberals . Technically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Premier designate was named . Meanwhile , however , there could be no further moves to bring back King Leopold who had called for swift parliamentary action to restore his royal prerogatives on the strength of his margin in last Sunday 's vote . The Government 's fall was a victory for the Socialists . By strikes and shrill propaganda raising a threat of civil war the Socialists apparently still hope to convince King Leopold to change his mind and abdicate . They have received no encouragement from his Catholic supporters , most of whom remained as determined as ever that the King should be brought back as soon as possible after the new Government was formed . Virtually all of the 300,000 mining , metallurgical and public utility workers , who participated in the " warning " strikes throughout the country 's southern industrial belt yesterday , returned to work today . But the tactic of snap walkouts was to be continued . Leaders of 15,000 Antwerp dockers said the men would refuse to work Monday . Socialist Parley Called A special Socialist congress was called for tomorrow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still talk of a general strike if King Leopold returned but the Socialist Trade Union Federation was not believed to have sufficient funds to support a general walkout for more than a few days . Some Liberal Ministers empha. sized after the Cabinet meeting the split with the Catholics was " not irreparable . " This was interpreted two ways : that the Liberals would agree not to overthrow an all . Catholic party minority govern . ment , which assumed sole responsibility for calling a joint session , or that the Liberals would agree to a new coalition once the royal question ' was settled . Liberal Deputy Premier and Defense Minister Albert Deveze said the decision to resign was a " solution ' of mutual loyalty , " apparently a reference to the coalition agreement that did not engage the Liberals to responsibility for convok. // ing Parliament to rescind the Regency . " We must now seek a Premier designate who can form a Government on the basis of a formula that will have national support , " said M. Deveze , acknowledging , however , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely a more ardent Leopoldist than M. Eyskens would eventually agree to ' try to form a minority Government . The name of Foreign Minister Paul van Zeeland was being mentioned tonight . But M. van Zeeland tried and failed after last ' June 's elections in which the Catholic party won 43 per cent of the national vote . In any event any new Government would be expected to last only until the King had returned . As a last resort new general elections could be held but no one as yet favored this course . The Liberals and Socialists wanted to avoid them because they believed the new vote would be likely to give the Catholics a clear majority in both Houses of Parliament . The Catholics would prefer to bring the King back now rather than continue the tense royal question for the four to six more weeks necessary for balloting and of course they could not be certain how the electorate would react to a new election following so closely after the vote on ; the royal question . Also there is a quarrel within the Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as to provoke a split . The dispute is between the moderate and ardent Leopoldists with M. Eyskens representing the moderates and Interior Minister Albert de Vleeschauwer the ardent Leopoldists . While M. Eyskens was in Geneva counseling moderation to King Leopold it was reliably reported M. de Vleeschauwer continually telephoned the King from Brussels , urging him to stand firm and assuring him public order would be maintained on his return . M. Eyskens reportedly clashed with the Interior Minister over what he considered a backhanded bit of political trickery . Party Leaders Called BRUSSELS ; March 18 UP ) ? Prince Charles saw Robert Gillon , Liberal chairman of the House , and Franz van . Cauwelaert , Social Christian President of the Senate , and then called in the presidents of the Social Christian , Liberal and Socialist parties . Julien Lahaut , president of the Communist party , was summoned too , but he could not attend . ) The Regent then susipended consultations until Monday .                    @
