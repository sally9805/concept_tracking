txt It is not very often that a law suit is important enough to stir the chancelleries of the world and the nation 's crossroads at one and the same time . Yesterday the United States Supreme Court heard arguments in just such a case In the unfortunate attair 0 ! the killing of a Japanese woman by Army Specialist Third Class William S. Girard are entangled questions of international significance , political significance and Constitutional significance . At the bottom of it all , though , is a point that may seriously affect the wellbeing of any U. S. member of the armed force% serving his country overseas now or in the future . That point is whether or not the individual in uniform may be used individually as an instrument of foreign policy in disregard of the established procedures . And that , it strikes us , is exactly what the United States Government has done in the Girard case . Under the status of forces agreement with Japan a member of the armed forces who breaks a Japanese law while off duty is answerable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answers to a U. S. court martial . The Army claimed that Girard was on duty at the time of the Japanese civilian 's death  --  guarding a machine gun . The Japanese claimed that the shooting was " unauthorized " and that therefore Girard was not on duty . The agreement provides the mechanics for resolving such disputes over jurisdiction . But , unless we are completely misinformed about this case , the mechanics were not fully carried out . The United States Government , to please the Japanese Government , surrendered jurisdiction despite the Army 's claim and ordered Girard turned over to a Japanese court for trial . Girard 's family filed suit and a Fed- eral judge in Washington ruled that the Government had no right to order Girard surrendered to the Japanese and that to do so would violate Girard 's Constitutional rights . The Government argues that the decision to surrender the soldier was an act of executive discretion carrying out an executive agreement and that the Supreme Court has nothing to say about such things . But the Supreme Court can have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either the Constitution or the status of forces agreement so far as we know is there any authority to surrender a citizen  --  soldier or civilian  --  to Japan or any other foreign country simply because the Government thinks that such a surrender would make the conduct of its foreign affairs more pleasant . And that is what any number of Government officials , from Secretary of State Dulles down , have admitted is at the bottom of the surrender . Some pious words have been spoken in Washington about the effect on U. S. relations abroad if the Supreme Court declines the Government request to surrender Girard , and some warnings have been issued about the effect on the morale of the armed forces stationed in Japan if the people there become angered at us . That has nothing to do with the legal points of the case , but if morale is their concern , the men in Washington who would use Girard as an instrument of foreign policy might well ponder the morale of soldiers overseas if it turns out that they may become at any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government affairs will , we hope , prove as legally distasteful to the Supreme Court as it is morally distasteful to the majority of Americans .
