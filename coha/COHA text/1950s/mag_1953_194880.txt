It took the Bolsheviks ten years to proclaim their first five-year plan . Last week the eager pupil outdid the master : only three years after the Communist conquest of China , Peking proclaimed a five-year plan . Said Premier Chou Enlai : " With the national territory entirely liberated , with the exception of Formosa , with bandits now liquidated , and with agrarian reform nearly completed . . . the time has come . " <P> Nobody specified what it would cost or what the planners planned . Best guess : concentration on metals and chemicals . " Some may ask whether large-scale construction is possible when our government is already so deeply engaged in a struggle in Korea with America , " observed the Peking Daily . " The answer is unequivocal and positive . China must industrialize ! "
