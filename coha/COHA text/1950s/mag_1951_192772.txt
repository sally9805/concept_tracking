Forrest Ray Colson was a thin , pallid , blond boy . His hands were soft and white , and he wore gloves whenever possible . But for all this he wanted to be a " big hero " and have lots of girls . At 16 he left high school in Hollywood and joined the Marine Corps . He served six unrewarding years , from 1941 to 1947 . He saw no action , won no medals . <P> Discharged , he joined the Monterey Park ( Calif. ) police force as a rookie . His neat uniform , pistol and dark gloves had the desired effect on females ; he came to work with a girl on each arm , stole off with women when on patrol duty-and was dropped from the force . He got another job as a rookie cop on the police force of nearby Glendora . After two months the chief called him in and fired him . The reason : women . Colson picked up his pistol , put it to his head and said , " I bet you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You wanta dare me ? " The chief talked him out of it . <P> Colson went to Oklahoma City and moved in with his mother . The 26-year-old ex-hero seemed to have plenty of money saved ; he bought a maroon and black Ford , and took occasional trips back to California , where he dropped in at the Monterey Park police station to ask for a fresh chance to become a cop . <P> One evening last week a woman clerk , who had just started home after her day 's work at a San Gabriel , Calif , supermarket , saw a frightening apparition climb out of an automobile at the rear of the store . Its face was covered by a black mask , dark goggles and a gas respirator . It wore a black helmet decorated by three metal antennas and a skull &; crossbones , was dressed in a black shirt , black pants , black boots and black gloves . It carried a shotgun , wore two bone-handled .38s on its hips and a bandoleer of shotgun shells . <P> <P> The apparition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ran for a telephone and called the police . The masked figure had been robbing suburban Los Angeles supermarkets for ten months , had gotten away with more than $50,000 . Anywhere else a man in a space suit would have attracted attention ; but in Southern California eccentrics were so common that supermarket clerks refused , until too late , to get excited at the appearance of a Man from Mars . But this time the police arrived just as the apparition was leaving the store , clutching $13,675 in a canvas bank bag . As it began leveling its shotgun , a patrolman fired one shot from the hip . The figure fell , shot through the temple . The cops pulled off the mask and helmet , and there lay Forrest Ray Colson-back in uniform . He died two hours later .
