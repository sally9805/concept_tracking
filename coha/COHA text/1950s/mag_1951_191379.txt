To boost its steel production , Youngstown Sheet &; Tube Co. last week announced a $90 million expansion of its East Chicago ( Ind. ) mill . With 75 new coke ovens and a new 1,400-ton blast furnace , the new plant will raise Youngstown 's steel ingot capacity by 20% , its pig iron capacity by 15% . When the new ovens are finished , Youngstown will move from sixth place among the steelmakers into a tie with fifth-place National Steel Corp . ( capacity of each : 5,200,000 tons ) . <P> Youngstown 's expansion is part of a $470 million program by 18 U.S. steel companies , undertaken with an assist from the Government . The National Security Resources Board earlier this month gave the companies " necessity certificates " allowing them , for tax purposes , to write off about 75% of the cost of expansion in five years , instead of the usual 15 to 20 years . Thus , most of the cost of expansion will come out of money that would otherwise be paid in taxes .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
