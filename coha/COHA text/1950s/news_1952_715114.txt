" Tithe Crop Is Better " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor said . " He called me to his farm late in the summer to show that all his acreage was bountiful , but on the dedicated land the cotton stood 12 inches higher than the rest and yielded one and three-quarters bales an acre , compared with an average yield of one bale an acre on his other land . " He asked me why . " Why ? In Malachi iii , 10 , it says : ' Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse , that there may be meat in Mine house and prove Me now herewith , saith the Lord of hosts , if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing , that there shall not be room enough to receive it . ' " That . is why . "
