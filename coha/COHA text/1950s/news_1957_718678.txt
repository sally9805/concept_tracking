txt David Daniel Beck , president of the Teamsters Union , looks like a banker , dresses like a banker , and habitually votes Republican . He hates and repudiates all forms of socialism . He is a confirmed capitalist and extolls the profit system . He neither smokes , drinks , nor rramhine He has boasted that he is a millionaire and some assert he is a multimillionaire . He dresses neatly and sedately in tailored suits . He is in bad trouble in Washington where Senate investigators say , concerning $270,000 in reputed loans of union funds , that there is no evidence of a loan nor a gift . Mr. Beck is scheduled to appear to explain matters before the Senate Rackets Committee March 26 . It will be the biggest show of the session  --  maybe of the year . The whole nation is interested in the finances of the pink-faced , bald , heavy-set labor leader with pale blue eyes who looks like a banker . Beck Epitomizes Phase Nor is the Beck story the story of one man . Fairly or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mushroom labor development , and around him is the question put , " Why does n't organized labor clean house ? " One answer to that is to look at the state of evolution of the American trade-union movement . Theoretically , it is organized into the top organization , the giant AFL-CIO of which George Meany is the head . Actually , Mr. Meany is only a kind of feudal king among powerful barons , all just about as strong as he is . The unions have the individual autonomy of the 13 states under the Articles of Confederation , before the United States Constitution set up the central government . Mr. Beck 's own union has risen under his smooth operation from about 1,200,000 members to about 1,500,000 . Mr. Beck inherited from his predecessor , Daniel J. Tobin , a loosely knit confederation of locals . Mr. Beck promptly created strong central government ? too strong , his critics aver . Mr. Beck began as a poor boy who drove a laundry wagon in Seattle . His standards of success were those of bigness and grandeur  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methodically and successfully to his goal , believing in all the material criteria of his generation . Trappings ? of Success So far as most material criteria of success go , Mr. Beck has achieved them . He has a $50,000-a-year salary , but this is only part of it  --  his last income tax was $91,000 , or nearly twice as much as his salary . This is because he has branched out into many other activities . He liked grandeur and moved the Teamsters Union headquarters ? from Indiana into a sleek , modern , marble office building in Washington near the Capitol where , as he once explained with the critical tone of any other successful big businessman , " we can keep an eye on Congress . " Interior decorations of the building are lush , but genteel . His own office has the svelte luxury of the big corporate executive which is what Mr. Beck feels he exemplifies . Mr. Beck is at home among railroad kings and industrial tycoons , and believes that in the power sense he should be on an equality to bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teamsters  --  and incidentally make a comfortable thing out of it for himself , Dave Beck . Senate Sifts Funds Mr. Beck identifies himself so intimately with his union that its funds and his own seem at times interchangeable . The trade union bought and gave him a comfortable home on the West Coast , at a price of $163,000 . It has a tiled swimming pool . So far as the Senate investigators can ascertain , there is deep confusion between Beck money and union money . What have the teamsters got from all this ? Most observers says that Mr. Beck 's methods have given the average shirt-sleeved driver , high-balling a fast truck over Route 66 , a lot better pay and better hours than he had before . Mr. Beck has n't bothered much about democracy , but the individual teamsters generally seem to feel ' they are a heap better off . " There are some signs of revolt over the Senate committee 's revelations  --  Local 46 at La Salle , Ill. , demands Mr. Beck 's resignation , Local 114 in Cincinnati votes unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unit , and so on : But on the whole they appear to be loyal . They suspect a " plot . " They never have found too much sympathy for labor in the world in which they live . After all , the conservative newspapers which they read seem to be as much cut off from their prejudices and aspirations as is Mr. Beck , on a personal basis , at the other end of the scale . Violation of Ethics ? Walter Reuther and James B. Carey , two AFL-CIO vice-presidents , have condemned the Teamsters Union . The union is in violation o the code of ethics of the AFL-CIO . But the Teamsters have a kind of oblique veto power over their own expulsion . Many a time a less powerful union has been able to enforce a picket line only because the Teamsters cooperated . The Teamsters are the biggest unit in the AFL-CIO ; Senator William F. Knowland ( R ) of California is the latest legislator to say trade unions should " clean their own house . " But Washington winds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect union funds . ? Most teamsters wait arid see : Page 10.
