For the first time since the U.S. Department of Agriculture began buying corn to support its price ( in 1933 ) , farmers voted last week to abolish the acreage controls that went with the high , rigid props . In 26 commercial corn states 346,976 farmers voted 71.1% for a new program proposed by Secretary Ezra Taft Benson . Result : next year corn growers will give up a system that paid 75% to 90% of parity if they planted no more than a Government-set limit , turn to a system that sets the props closer to real market value ( i.e. , 90% of the previous three-year average , but not below 65% of parity ) for all the corn they can raise . <P> " This was the first clear-cut , realistic choice farmers have ever had on the question of controls versus freedom of decision , " crowed Benson . " Farmers are now free to plant as much or as little corn as they wish , with the safeguard of a reasonable support level . They have acted in their own , best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , as Benson devoutly hopes , provide a long-range step-down of subsidized prices toward market prices , may help trim the monstrous program that inflated USDA 's current budget to $6.9 billion . But , in the short haul , Benson 's economy-seeking victory could become the costliest cornucopia in the history of subsidies. * In recent years only a small proportion ( 12% in 1958 ) of corn farms qualified for high supports by staying inside the Government 's acreage limits . Farmers who planted more fed it to livestock , sold it on the open market-or sold it to the Government under a slightly lower price prop , which Benson obligingly extended to such " noncompliance " corn three crops ago . After 1956 the extra price prop was never guaranteed before the crop was planted , but the farmers ' expectations encouraged surplus production . Last week , before the vote , word went around the corn belt that Benson would not support noncompliance corn next year if farmers rejected his plan . Thus many who approved his new system felt that they were voting for continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to cut subsidies . <P> Uncertainty Removed . The big threat to the Treasury lies in the fact that Benson 's scheme removes all uncertainty about what a farmer can get for his corn , no matter how big the crop . The price : $1.12 to $1.15 per bu. , about 12 lower than high supports would have been , but 6 to 9 per bu. higher than the present price peg for noncompliance corn . At Benson 's price , efficient growers can make good money on all the well-fertilized hybrids that their big tractors can cultivate . <P> For example , in Iowa 's Mahaska County , one farmer let 176 of his 800 acres lie idle in the now-expiring soil-bank " acreage reserve , " this year put only 14 acres in corn . In a move matched by many a neighbor , he decided after last week 's vote to plant corn on 250 to 300 acres-18 times as much as this year . " If they want corn , " said he , " we 'll give ' em corn . " <P> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government $1.8 billion , eats up $370,000 a day in storage fees .
