When Eastern Air Lines ' Captain Eddie Rickenbacker offered to pay $100 million for 35 Comet jet transports ( TIME , Sept. 8 ) , it seemed to be a golden opportunity for the British to grab a big chunk of the U.S. commercial plane market . But last week it looked as if the British had muffed <P> the opportunity . Captain Eddie insisted <P> that he had to have the Comets by 1956 . <P> Comet Builder de Havilland said that he <P> could not turn out that many before 1957 . <P> That was too late for Rickenbacker . <P> Right now he is modernizing Eastern 's <P> fleet with 30 new Super-Constellations , <P> the last 16 of which will have Curtiss-Wright compound engines , giving the <P> Connie enough speed and range to match <P> flight time with present Comets over long <P> hauls . By 1956 , Rickenbacker will have <P> this whole fleet paid for and will be ready <P> for his next big move , which he thinks is <P> into either jets or turboprops . He wants <P> to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep , a lead on his U.S. rivals . <P> As far as Rickenbacker is concerned , the present Comet is too small . Nor does he want the faster 44-passenger Comet II , scheduled for limited production next year , although he is willing to buy a couple to test on the New York-Puerto Rico run . Rickenbacker wanted De Havilland to jump ahead to the 60-to-75-passenger Comet III , whose prototype has not yet even been built . Said Rickenbacker : " If I were an Englishman , I would work day and night-including weekends-to keep the advantage they have . " De Havilland 's reply : it can not boost commercial production and meet its rearmament quotas . Then , said Rickenbacker , it ought to license a U.S. maker who can mass-produce the Comet III . Echoed London 's Daily Mail : " Britain . . . will have to scrap the outworn ideas and practices which have been hampering her industries since the end of the war . If we go dawdling along as if it did n't matter much anyway , we shall deservedly lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The truth of that warning lay in the fact that the U.S. , which had trailed the British in jet engines , is fast catching up . While the British have only limited production of their best jet engines , Pratt &; Whitney is now ready to mass-produce its powerful J-57 ; Westinghouse is getting ready to do the same with its J40 ( see below ) . And while U.S. plane builders have built no jet transports , they are gathering plenty of experience with the big jet bombers like Boeing 's 6-47 and 6-52 . If the British can not take advantage of their transport lead now , U.S. builders may soon overtake them .
