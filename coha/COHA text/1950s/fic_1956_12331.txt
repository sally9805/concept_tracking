Time : Then Place : A far country The scene is outside the city in an open space which is used by the children as their playground . At the rear is a low wall , beyond which is a precipice leading to the dragon 's cave . The right and left are flanked by low shrubbery . When we first see them many children are playing in this space . In the foreground JULIUS and THASSAN are throwing a ball to each other . The play goes on until the ball passes THASSAN and goes over the wall . When the other children learn that the ball has gone over the wall , they run to the wall and look over . JULIUS ( pointing ) There it goes rolling down the hill . ILLEA I hope it will stop before it reaches the bottom . THASSAN It 's stopping now . Let 's go for it . ( He starts towards the left . ) ANTONELLA ( stopping him ) The great wolf may get you . ILLEA The monster down there is not a wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's a lion ? ILLEA Because it roars like a lion . THASSAN It also howls like a wolf . p. 3 ANTONELLA And it screeches like an owl at certain times . JULIUS Let 's go down anyway . THASSAN Come on . ILLEA ( as they start ) Wait . You remember no one has ever come from there alive . JULIUS I do n't want to lose our ball . ANTONELLA It will be better to lose the ball than to lose your life . THASSAN What will we have to play with ? ILLEA You can find another ball or something else . JULIUS There 's nothing else to find around here . ANTONELLA Then we might as well go back to the city . ( They start toward the right . ) KALI ( looking ahead ) Look ! Someone is coming . ( They stop and look ahead . ) BURNO It 's the Prime Minister . RHEA And the soothsayer is with him . JULIUS I wonder why they are coming here . ILLEA It is strange to see them at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . ANTONELLA I hope not . ( At this point THE PREMIER and THE SOOTHSAYER enter from the left . They are gray-haired men dressed in long robes . THE PREMIER 's robe is purple and the SOOTHSAYER 's robe is blue . THE PREMIER has folded paper in his hand . ) PREMIER Attention , everyone . ( THE BOYS align themselves at the rear and THE GIRLS at the right facing THE PREMIER and THE SOOTHSAYER . ) Listen attentively . ( Everyone is quiet as he reads . ) " It has been decreed that beginning today and on all days hereafter the youth of our country , both male and female , shall be trained regularly in all their games and athletic competitions ; and when they have arrived at a suitable age they , both male and female , shall in like manner be trained in scholarship and learning . The power of the mind will rule in the future more than the power of strong arms . In order that this law may be enforced in a manner pleasant and agreeable to the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select from among you two males and one female to be your leaders in these games and competitions . " ( Having finished reading he folds the paper . ) If this pronouncement is not clear to you I will read it again . ( Silence . ) Did anyone fail to hear the decree , or hearing , did anyone misunderstand it ? ( Silence . ) Since no one speaks , I must take it that the meaning is clear to all of you . You will note that I , the Premier , have been empowered to select from among you two males and one female to be your leaders in these games and competitions . I shall make my selections now , and if for any reason anyone of you objects to one of those selected , speak at once and state your objections . p. 5 BURNO ( stepping forward ) Sir , if there is an objection to one of those you select , does that mean that the person selected will be replaced by another ? PREMIER No , Burno , it means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconsidered and his qualifications weighed more carefully . BURNO Thank you , sir . ( Steps back into line . ) PREMIER My first selection is Julius ( There are murmurs of approval . ) Julius , come forward . ( JULIUS steps out and stands in front of the line of boys . ) My next selection is Thassan . ( Again the murmurs are heard . ) Come forward , Thassan . ( THASSAN steps forward and stands beside JULIUS . ) My third selection is Rhea . Come forward , Rhea . ( As RHEA comes forward there is applause from the girls . ) Is there an objection to any one of these ? BURNO ( stepping forward ) I object to Julius , sir . PREMIER State your objection . BURNO I object to him because his grandfather was a slave to my grandfather . I do not feel that the descendant of a slave should be one of our leaders . p. 6 PREMIER It is true , Burno , that Julius ' grandfather was a slave , and that the stain of slavery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow one 's descendants through generations ; but I remember Julius ' father , who was a soldier and a hero and who died in defense of our country . KALI ( stepping forward ) But , sir , Julius is still the descendant of a slave . PREMIER Yet , according to law , the stain of slavery was wiped away from all descendants of Julius ' father because he gave his life for his country . That is law and custom . BURNO Would it not be better to select one to lead whose whole family has been proud and free from its beginning ? PREMIER If one can be found among you who is superior to Julius in intelligence , strength and bravery he will be selected . KALI We acknowledge Julius ' intelligence , sir ; but his strength and bravery we doubt . PREMIER Then there must be a test of his strength ; but before there is a test , I must ask if there is one among you who will speak in Julius ' favor . RHEA I will , sir . ANTONELLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Julius . I believe he is superior in intelligence , bravery and strength to any among us. p. 7 PREMIER Then there shall be a test now . THASSAN Sir , before we go on , are we to understand that Julius ' leadership depends on this test and not on whether the stain of slavery is still on his family ? PREMIER I must repeat . It is the law that if a man is a slave , and a descendant of his becomes a soldier of his country , or serves his country in any praiseworthy manner , all descendants of the one who has served his country well shall have the same rights and privileges as all other citizens . So Julius ' leadership depends on this test alone . Are there any more questions ? THASSAN No , sir . PREMIER Then the soothsayer shall arrange the tests of strength and bravery . SOOTHSAYER ( to BURNO ) Burno , who in your opinion is stronger than Julius ? BURNO Kali , sir . SOOTHSAYER Then the test of strength shall be between Julius and Kali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . SOOTHSAYER Julius and Kali come forward . . . . ( THE TWO BOYS move forward . ) Face each other . . . . ( They face each other . ) Each grasp the other 's right hand . . . . When I give the word put all the strength of your right arm and hand into your grip , and he whose knee first touches the earth shall be declared defeated . . . . ( A pause . ) Now ! ( He claps his hands together sharply . JULIUS and KALI squeeze each other 's hand with all their force . At first KALI 's superior weight forces JULIUS to bend toward the ground , but he soon recovers and puts all his strength against KALI . Gradually KALI , lacking enough endurance , begins to bend , until his knee touches the ground . ) Julius is the victor in the test of strength . ( There are cheers for JULIUS as KALI , crestfallen , goes back to his place in the line. ) p. 8 PREMIER Now , do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PREMIER How would you test the bravery of those you would have as your leaders ? THASSAN Let the soothsayer decide . PREMIER The soothsayer , then , shall decide a test of bravery . SOOTHSAYER You would have those who would be your leaders brave enough to face any danger , would you not ? BURNO Yes , sir . SOOTHSAYER Even death ? BURNO Yes , sir . SOOTHSAYER Then I shall give a test of your bravery from which only those with stout hearts will not shrink . ( There is a pause while they wait for the decision . SOOTHSAYER points toward the precipice . ) The dragon ! Let those who would be your leaders bring me the dragon 's tooth ! ALL ( stepping back in fear ) The dragon 's tooth ! SOOTHSAYER If there are those among you brave enough to go down to the dragon 's lair , the same ones are brave enough to lead you . ANTONELLA But , sir , it is almost certain death to go down to the dragon 's lair. p. 9 ILLEA It is certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My elders have told me that many brave men have died seeking it . ANTONELLA My grandfather told me that strong men have been blinded by the stare of the dragon 's eyes , and that the blood of valiant soldiers has been frozen by looking on his awful form . SOOTHSAYER It is dangerous , but not impossible . ILLEA Why must you have the tooth ? What is there about it ? Is it valuable ? SOOTHSAYER ( as everyone listens attentively ) When I was young and strong , there lived two dragons in the cave below with many young ones . At that time a spirit whispered in my ear that the female dragon had in her mouth a tooth on which was written , in strange lines that only the wise could read , the secret of the future good of the world . I told the king and he , in spite of my warning , sent two of his warriors down to kill the dragons , but those warriors never returned . ANTONELLA What happened to them ? SOOTHSAYER I knew what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was determined ; and so they died . JULIUS How did they die ? SOOTHSAYER While they were killing the female they were struck down by the male dragon . p. 10 ILLEA If you know so many things , why do you not know the secret on the tooth ? SOOTHSAYER Only the gods know that . I know the secret is there , and I can read it , but it must be brought to me . JULIUS Which dragon has the wonderful strange tooth ? SOOTHSAYER The female one . The one the warriors killed . THASSAN And so the tooth is still in the dragon 's jaw ? SOOTHSAYER That was years and years ago . Since then the vultures have eaten away the flesh and scattered the bones so that there only remain the dragon 's skull and teeth . Since then the little dragons have grown strong ; and now along with the older male they watch the skull and teeth by turns as if these remnants of the mother were sacred . No minute passes in the day or night when two large blazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret ever be brought to you ? ILLEA If the warrior clad in armor can not do it , is it possible to do ? SOOTHSAYER There are few things that are not possible . I know it can be done , and I know it will be done . Some youth of our country will bring away the dragon 's tooth . Who among you is brave enough to try ? p. 11 JULIUS I will . THASSAN I will . RHEA I will . ( As these three volunteer BURNO and KALI slip back into the crowd . ) JULIUS ( to SOOTHSAYER ) How can it be done , sir ? SOOTHSAYER A youth unarmored and weaponless can bring the secret to us . You can bring it if you are bold and careful . JULIUS You think that I could do so great a thing ? SOOTHSAYER Any youth could do it who would be bold and careful . JULIUS ( eagerly ) If we should bring the secret to you , then we should be great forever throughout the world , would we not ? SOOTHSAYER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who would obey the instructions would be happy . JULIUS Tell us what we can do to bring it to you . SOOTHSAYER You say your ball has fallen over the cliff ? JULIUS Yes , sir . SOOTHSAYER Then you , Thassan and Rhea go down by the path and find the ball ; and when you find it play about with it . Roll it here and there . Roll it close to the mouth of the dragon 's cave and near the skull ; then pull the longest , loosest tooth and bring it to me . On it is written the secret . p. 12 RHEA How are we to outlive the blazing eyes that have destroyed so many ? THASSAN How are we to escape the powerful paw ? SOOTHSAYER Keep your eyes on the ground and on the skull and tooth . Do not look into the blazing eyes , or you will be destroyed . He will not harm you otherwise . He will not strike you with his powerful paw . He will not notice you ; he looks for warriors armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be away before he will know it 's gone . JULIUS ( moving toward the left ) Come , Thassan . Come , Rhea ; let us go . SOOTHSAYER Do as I have said and you can not fail . THASSAN We will get it . We will not fail . ( All three go out left . ) ILLEA Suppose they fail to bring the dragon 's tooth ? SOOTHSAYER Then the secret must remain hidden until it is brought , but it can be brought . I have seen it in a dream . A youth will do it . ANTONELLA I can not see how anything can be written on a dragon 's tooth . SOOTHSAYER It was written there by the gods . ILLEA In what language did the gods write it ? p. 13 SOOTHSAYER In a language not known to you . In a language known to the gods and known to me . ANTONELLA It must be strange to know so many things . SOOTHSAYER ( pointing to the left ) Look over the cliff and see what they are doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ILLEA We can not see them . ANTONELLA I hope the dragon has not captured them . SOOTHSAYER ( with his eyes closed ) You can not see them , but I can see them . ILLEA ( turning to him ) How can you see them ? SOOTHSAYER As I see all things . ANTONELLA What are they doing ? SOOTHSAYER They are near the mouth of the cave , close to the skull . ILLEA And the dragon , what is he doing ? SOOTHSAYER The dragon does not notice them . ( Then he speaks with more excitement . ) They have the tooth ! They are coming ! Watch for them ! ( Everyone looks over the cliff. ) p. 14 ANTONELLA ( excitedly ) They are running this way ! I know they have it ! ILLEA Run , Julius ! Run , Thassan ! Run , Rhea ! ( There is great excitement among all of them . ) ANTONELLA Here they are ! ( JULIUS , THASSAN and RHEA appear at the left . ) JULIUS ( holding out his hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could find ; but it has nothing on it . THASSAN Nothing but a few scratches . SOOTHSAYER Give me the tooth . ( After JULIUS gives it to him ) This is the one . The secret is written here . ILLEA ( as all gather around ) I do not see it . SOOTHSAYER You see it , but you do not understand it . ANTONELLA Interpret it for us , sir . SOOTHSAYER ( reading slowly ) " The secret of the future good of the world depends on the growth of Love and Brotherhood . These must rule the world in the place of Envy and Hate . " p. 15 JULIUS How can this future good be realized ? SOOTHSAYER ( still reading slowly ) " The youth of the world must bring this good about . It must grow in their hearts until they are men and women , and as they grow they must spread the truth abroad . " THASSAN Let 's go back to the city and tell what we have found . RHEA Yes , let 's tell the glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence ) Yes , go back to the city and spread the news . Tell everyone that those who brought the tooth are worthy to be leaders . ( All begin to go toward the city . ) CURTAIN
