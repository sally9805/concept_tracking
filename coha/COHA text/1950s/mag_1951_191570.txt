Reservists and National Guardsmen were fed to the gills and hopping mad . Wherever they went looking for jobs , more &; more employers were beginning to ask pointed questions and phrase the same harsh answers : " Sorry , we have to give it to someone we know will be here next year . " <P> The reluctance to take on men who might soon be in uniform had not yet spread to all employers . But there were already enough examples to support the citizen-soldiers ' gripes . In Boston , Chicago and San Francisco , reservists and guardsmen angrily complained that they were being i ) passed by on promotion lists , 2 ) asked to quit their outfits ( just about impossible ) or start breaking in replacements . In Dalton , Ga. , a young National Guard corporal had just been offered a better job . He inadvertently mentioned the Guard . " Whoa , just a moment , " snapped the interviewer , and called off the deal . In Atlanta , a sergeant in the Air Force Reserve hunted fruitlessly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife &; child . <P> Unfair as it was , there was little or nothing to be done about the situation . An unemployed New Mexico reservist summed it up bitterly : " They tell us to be patriotic and join the reserves , so in gratitude , they make us starve . " - <P> National Guardsmen and regular soldiers had another special and startling gripe of their own . Under the present snafued pension laws , noted the Army Times , an Army or Air Force Reserve captain killed in Korea would leave a pension of $331.80 a month to his widow and two children ; a Regular Army or National Guard captain killed by the same shellburst would leave his dependents a pension of only $130 a month . Reason : reservists come under the same pension laws as civilian employees of the Government ; regulars and guardsmen ( as well as all Marine and Navy personnel with more than a month 's service ) under the much less liberal Veterans Administration provisions .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
