txt Metered parking for about 50D cars under the new Boston Central Artery from Sumner Tunnel to North Station will be provided before Christmas . Herman Carp , Commissioner of the Real Property Department for Boston , said today he is cooperating with the state Public Works Department in preparing the area and hopes to have it completed for holiday shoppers . Current estimates show that 80 spaces will be available between two ramps from Travers Street to Washington Street , 50 on the fringe ' of the artery at Haymarket Square near subsidiary ramps , 220 from Cross Street to North Street , and 160 from Causeway to Travers Streets . There is not much likelihood that much more of the space under the central artery can be utilized for off-street parking spaces , according to city officials . Much of the space is taken up with supports for the arterial highway , transformer stations , and other obstructions . In addition , parking under the artery is severely limited since the problem of entrances and exits to the parking spaces must be controlled so as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , much of the space under the arterial highway will be used for roadway . The section from North Street to Oliver Street , for example , will be paved for regular traffic . The estimated cost of the parking plan to the city is $80,000 and a transfer for this amount from the special parking meter fund has been requested from the City Council . Considerably less than this will be needed , however , since the city expects the Boston Edison Company to install lights under the highway under the same flat rate contract it has for all Boston electric street lighting . This will save $21,500 of the 880,000 , plus future maintenance costs . While Boston does not anticipate using much snore space under the artery , there are plans for off-street parking garages near the ramps of the highway . The first will be at Fort Hill Square at High Street . The city is contethplating an elevator-type ? garage here that would rise 10 to 12 stories into the air .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
