Secretary of State John Foster Dulles last week conceded " in principle " that Americans are entitled to " adequate information " about Red China-but offered a tentative formula for coverage that most news organizations considered inadequate and impractical . In conference with a group of newspaper , magazine and broadcasting representatives invited to discuss the situation , Dulles modified his previous proposal ( TIME , May 6 ) for pooled coverage by a limited number of " responsible " correspondents and offered to lift the ban for ten to 15 newsmen for a six-month trial period . His aim : to restrict China coverage to the twelve* news-gathering organizations that had correspondents on the mainland before the Communists took over in 1949 . <P> Dulles asked the news representatives to join him in selecting the organizations to be allowed correspondents in China , but the Washington Post and Times Herald 's J. Russell Wiggins , representing the American Society of Newspaper Editors , objected that U.S. policy of no contact with Red China is a Dulles-Eisenhower policy , and therefore the President and Secretary of State must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions to it . The newsmen objected to Dulles ' proposed limitation on the size of the group because it ignored " technological " changes since the war , i.e. , the growth of TV reporting . Also , argued the Holyoke ( Mass . ) Transcript-Telegram 's William Dwight , president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association , " economic factors " provide a built-in limitation on the number of correspondents in China . Probable outcome : six-month visas for 20 to 35 newsmen . <P> <P> * Associated Press , United Press , International News Service , New York Times , New York Herald Tribune , Chicago Tribune , Chicago Daily News , Christian Science Monitor , TIME-LIFE , NBC , CBS , ABC .
