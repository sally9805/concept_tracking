Highbrow Station For more than a year tiny , 550-watt Station KPFA had been fighting a losing game . Its highbrow FM programs were a big hit with a limited audience in Berkeley , home of the University of California . But without sponsors or commercials it had trouble making ends meet on the $10-a-year subscription fees paid by 300 of its listeners . Last August KPFA finally closed the doors of its two-studio station , regretfully fired its underpaid seven-man staff . <P> The public reaction was immediate and astonishing . Some 150 Berkeley citizens held a hasty mass meeting , raised $2,300 from the floor . Such notables as Philosopher Alexander Meiklejohn , Economist John B. Condliffe , Composers Darius Milhaud and Roger Sessions became KPFA sponsors . Dr. J. Raymond Cope , minister of Berkeley 's First Unitarian Church , enrolled 250 volunteer fundraisers , who collected a total of $23,000 in contributions . And Raytheon Manufacturing Co. donated the components of a new 16,100-watt transmitter which can send an FM signal throughout the whole San Francisco Bay area . <P> Last week , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncommercial brand of radio , nonprofit KPFA came back on the air . As before , there was no commercial advertising , no sponsored shows , but there was plenty of classical music , drama , talks . Highlight of the first week : the BBC recording of Goethe 's Faust , translated by Poet Louis MacNeice . Running time : three hours , 20 minutes .
