Machine-tool makers say their business is the " first to feel a recession , the last to recover . " Back in January 1956-when the rest of the U.S. economy was still going up-machine-tool orders began skidding from their boom level of $125 million a month . Last week signs appeared that they were on the upturn again . <P> After bobbing around in the low $20 millions all winter , new domestic orders for metal-cutting and shaping tools briefly hit $29.8 million in March ( caused by bunching up three large orders that normally would have been spread over a quarter ) , dropped to $20.8 million again in April , in May jumped to $23.7 million . To economists , who scan toolmakers ' order books for a tip-off to future spending plans of a wide range of manufacturers , even such slight changes are encouraging . <P> The pickup is still too new to be apparent to all toolmakers . For the first five months of this year , Detroit 's Cross Co. ( automated assembly equipment ) was 3% to 5% ahead of 1957 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Acme Co. ( automatic machine and threading tools ) said that June orders were 50% over May . <P> But a good many toolmakers want to see more proof . Said an officer of the Atlantic Machine Tool Works serving the Hartford area : " Sure , the tool business in Connecticut is looking up . When you are flat on your back , where else can you look but up ? " Pratt &; Whitney Co. ' s machine-tool plant at West Hartford says that employment is still off 25% from September . Not until general business improves will the tool business really hum . <P> One thing that holds up orders is a tug of war between toolmakers and their customers over price . Since the last general rises in 1956 , makers have not changed listed prices . But a lot of secret deals are being made . Said Greenlee Brothers &; Co. of Rockford , Ill. ( metal and wood working tools ) : " In the last few weeks we 've had more inquiries about orders than in the previous five months . From all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around . "
