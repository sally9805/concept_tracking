Ever since the Dixiecrat revolt of 1948 , politicians and pundits have been speculating about the course Southern Democrats would follow in 1952 . Truman failed to heal the rift between Northern and Southern Democrats . On the other hand , most of the Dixiecrat leaders lost ground within the Democratic Party . The South 's problem this time was how to oppose Truman without leaving the party . Last week the Southern leaders disclosed the first step in their program . <P> At a quiet press conference on Capitol Hill , Georgia 's Senator Richard Brevard Russell announced that he is a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination . Said he : " I am a Jeffersonian Democrat who believes in the greatest practicable degree of local self-government . " Would he support Harry Truman if the President is nominated ? " I shall not answer that until he is and I see the platform , " said straightforward Dick Russell . " ... I have never been one of those men who say vote the Democratic ticket even if it destroys my country . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Southern Democrat sky-Virginia 's Senator Harry Byrd , South Carolina 's Governor James Byrnes , Texas ' Governor Allan Shivers , Georgia 's Governor Herman Talmadge and Senator Walter George-promptly came out for Russell . All of them know that , at the moment , he has about as much chance of being nominated as a boll weevil has of winning a popularity contest at a cotton planters ' picnic . Then what are they trying to do ? <P> Most of all , they would like to encourage Harry Truman to retire , by showing him that the South is ready to stage a first-class revolt . Their greatest complaint against Truman : his race policies . They abhor the proposal for a federal fair employment practices law , which would strike at segregation . The Southerners rationalize their stand by claiming that this problem should be handled by the states . <P> Whether or not Russell &; Co. cause Harry Truman to take himself out , they want the South to have a powerful voice in the convention , both as to platform and nominee . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trumanite , and adopt another all-out civil-rights plank , is uncertain . Dick Russell would n't say what he will do . In 1948 he let his name go before the convention , and got 263 votes . But he refused to join the Dixiecrats ' post-convention bolt . After a 1952 convention defeat , the Southern Democrats could again try a third party , or they could try to swing the South to the Republican side . Unless the G.O.P. nominee is Dwight Eisenhower , the second course is no more likely than the first . <P> A third and more novel possibility is being widely discussed south of the Mason-Dixon line . Several Southern states have adopted or are adopting laws which keep presidential candidates ' names off the general election ballot . The citizens vote , instead , only for party electors , who will be free to cast their ballots for whomever they wish when the electoral college meets next December .
