As almost every Briton knows , the school called St. Trinian 's is a strange , spooky , neo-Gothic institution based somewhere in England . At St. Trinian 's , gargoylish women in high-collared dresses and spindle-shanked girls in mussy black tunics go blithely through term after term of arson , mayhem and murder . For sheer energy , the St. Trinian 's girl has no match . <P> She has an avid taste for " how-to " books , e.g. , How to Shrink a Human Head , is extremely inventive in lab ( " Smashing ! - Now pass the bat 's blood " ) , once thought up a ripping plan for blowing up Herbert Morrison and the Houses of Parliament on Guy Fawkes Day . <P> Sometimes she is seen strolling calmly down a corridor with a hippopotamus on a leash . Sometimes she is roasting an ox in her room , or hanging a teacher ( " Well , that 's O.K.-now for old ' Stinks ' " ) , or merely stretching a chum out on a medieval rack . On nature walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those out-they 're harmless " ) , would hardly ever go boating without making at least one lowerclassman walk the plank . Faced with a faculty frown ( " Hand up the girl who burnt down the East Wing last night " ) , she can look angelic ; but occasionally she must pay for her crimes by writing lines ( " I must not smoke cigars during prayers . I must not smoke cigars during . . . " ) . <P> In the last twelve years , these ghoulish girls have won fame &; fortune for their creator . A wiry , goateed man who still suffers from the " cab-horse knees " acquired in a World War II Japanese prisoner-of-war camp , Cartoonist Ronald Searle has seen St. Trinian 's become a part of the British public school folklore . His first two cartoon books have both gone through nine printings , and the school itself has appeared in skits in at least three musical revues . Today its bloody playing fields are as famous as Eton 's , and its horrible little girls are quite as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cartoonist Searle 's horror , St. Trinian 's has also become a synonym . He first realized this on the day he read a newspaper account of how three girls in Scotland actually did try to burn down a school . " When he read that , " says his wife , " he went absolutely white . I kept praying - please , please , do n't let them mention St. Trinian 's ! " But , of course , the newspapers did . <P> Last week , fed up with his own " Frankenstein monster , " Ronald Searle confirmed the closing of his imaginary school . In his new book , Souls in Torment , his girls are still playing their old tricks-but they are doing so for the last time . They squash their last teacher under a roller , stab their last classmate in gym ( " Some little girl did n't hear me say ' unarmed combat , ' " chides a teacher ) , and , having come into possession of some top secret information , they blow up their school with the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be only a word-to be used every time a school window is broken , a classroom wrecked or an underclassman over-hazed . Otherwise , wrote Poet C. Day Lewis in a special dirge , St. Trinian 's is gone : <P> Where are the girls of yesteryear ? How <P> strange To think they 're scattered East , South , <P> West and North-Those pale Medusas of the Upper <P> Fourth , Those Marihuanas of the Moated
