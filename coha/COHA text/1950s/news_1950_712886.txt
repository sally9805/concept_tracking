txt Letters to The Times STEPHEN LANCASTER.CHADWICK HALL.REX D. DRILLON.HENRY MAYER . pg . 170 Letters to The Times Aiding Indo-China Our Stand on Internal Affairs as Condition Pto Help Defended The writer of the following letter was formerly adviser to the Indonesian Department of the Netherlands Information Bureau in New York . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In recent days THE TIMES has pointed to the urgent need for a clear decision on United States policy in IndoChina . An editorial of May 6 warns , " If Indo-China is to be saved for a chance at freedom it must be saved promptly . " In a Bangkok dispatch filed the same day C. L. Sulzberger writes , " If French Indo-China succumbs to communism , it is held axiomatic by most observers , Malaya and Burma will topple soon thereafter . " With so much at stake , THE TIMES editorially comments that it is hard to understand United States delay in reaching concrete acts in the case of Indo-China . The editorial then suggests that the reason for delay is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers granted to Bao Dai a condition for any aid that may be given . " The further point is made , with an implicit note of disapproval , that this desire on the part of the United States seems to be an extension of the practice followed in Greece and Korea ? namely , the practice of using our aid as a means for exerting political pressure . I submit that THE TIMES has here touched upon a fundamental and unresolved dilemma facing United States foreign policy , a dilemma which not only hampers the formulation of a positive policy toward Indo-China but in varying degrees toward all countries , and particularly toward so-called " backward " countries . Internal Affairs From the post-World War I era we inherit a rule of international etiquette which says that we shall not meddle in the internal affairs of other sovereign nations . But today , due to our new position of world leadership , we find ourselves vitally interested in the internal affairs of other nations , and in a very real sense our foreign-aid programs unavoidably involve us in the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in their power to achieve stable governments and economies , then they can not be very useful friends and we can not effectively help them . When our friends seem unable to achieve these conditions , we are faced with the choice of taking steps to help put their home affairs in order or of withdrawing aid that is going to waste . This was the choice we faced in Greece and Korea . Our choice was intervention , but it was intervention of a different sort from that which we disavowed after World War I. At that time we were involved in the home affairs of some of our neighbors to the south , primarily for our own benefit . We had not been invited to share responsibility for their welfare and we were under no obligation to do so . Scope of Aid Today our involvement in the affairs of other nations is on an entirely new basis . We have been asked to make common cause with our friends abroad , we have been asked to lend them economic and military aid so that they may achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be done merely by handing over dollars and arms . Perhaps one of the chief reasons for our failure in China was our reluctance to interfere openly in the internal affairs of that unfortunate country . In China basic internal reforms were necessary if United States aid was to produce favorable results . The same is true in Indo-China and in some of the other non-Communist countries of that area . Most experts , including writers of THE TIMES , agree that the Bao Dai regime as presently constituted is unlikely to win adequate support from non-Communist nationalists . Therefore , urgent as aid to Indo-China may be , it would probably fail in its purpose unless accompanied by a political program acceptable to the IndoChinese . Type of Regime If the United States does aid IndoChina , other Southeast Asian countries and the world at large will hold our country responsible for what happens in Bao Dai 's domain . And , since by giving aid we would have to assume responsibility for what followed , it seems only fitting that we should go the whole way and actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Political interference in Indo-China for these ends would in no way be " imperialistic , " but would be in the common interests of ourselves and the Indo-Chinese . And it is high time that we began to realize the need for this type of friendly meddling , because it is the primary requisite for close cooperation with those underdeveloped nations which must have something more than marginal economic and military aid STEPHEN LANCASTER . New York , May 10 , 1950 . What the Electorate Seeks To THE EDITOR OF THE NEI/ YORK TIMES : It is hoped that Mr. Stassen 's recent speech in which he called Mr. Truman " the cleverest politician ever to occupy the White House * * * and the worst President " is not an indication that the Republicans intend to win the 1952 elections by denouncing the successful in their own profession . It would be ? as it has been in the past  --  a sore disappointment both to the G. 0 . P. and to , I believe , a majority of the electorate if the Republicans substitute a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ReFor a Unified N.L.R.B. Functioning of Agency Declared Impaired by Divided Powers The writer of the following letter , a former Assistant District Attorney , is counsel for unions in the telephone and utility fields . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On May 7 , 1950 , you published a letter from Richard A. Perkins advocating opposition to Reorganization Plan No. 12 which would abolish the office of General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board . There is much in Mr. Perkins ' letter that requires answering because his contentions are built upon erroneous grounds . I think an answer becomes even more essential from a public point of view at this time in the light of the action taken by the United States Senate May 11 in rejecting the plan . The National Labor Relations Board has gone on record as favoring abolition of the office of general counsel . Mr. Perkins assailed the board 's position because , as he asserts , it is hostile to our whole judicial system , would lead logically to elimination of review of board orders by the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations policy for the nation 's guidance . " Purpose of Board The board 's activities must not be confused ( as Mr. Perkins has confused them ) with the exercise of judicial powers by a court . Courts handle cases of every conceivable kind , springing ? from the ninny and varied complexities of the gregarious existence of our population . The National Labor Relations Board , on the other hand , is an administrative body ( like the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Securities Exchange Commission ) , created by Congress to carry out a specific policy of labor-relations which the Legislature has set forth as desirable for the nation . That policy can not adequately be carried out where , because of personalities and the intermeshing of spheres of action and power , two segments of the same agency work at cross-purposes . The general counsel has the power to issue complaints upon charges filed by unions and employers alike with no restraint by the board or the courts . On numerous occasions , the board has dismissed his complaints as being in complete non-conformity with the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general counsel has refused to issue complaints in many cases which have great merit and which the policy of the act calls for prosecuting , but his powers under the act are so great that the courts have said that no one can have any redress . One hundred and thirty years ago , the Supreme Court recognized the foolishness of having two wills working at cross-purposes . In the case of Houston vs . Moore , Mr. Justice Washington said : " We are altogether incapable of comprehending how two distinct wills can at the same time be exercised in relation to the same subject to be ' effective ' and at the same time compatible with each other . " Single Policy It is not only erroneous , but it is logically foolish , and , in very fact , expensive and confusing to have two equally dominant segments of a single agency with the power and the inclination to work at cross-purposes , where that agency is to carry out a single ( not a diversified ) national labor policy . Even if the board 's powers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a judge sets forth to a grand jury the orbit within which such jury can operate ? Does he not control that jury by his charges as to law  --  which may be likened to the board setting forth policy to be rigidly adhered to , rather than flouted , by the general counsel ? Mr. Perkins ' fears that the board 's position regarding abolition of the office of general counsel will lead logically to no review whatsoever of the board 's orders is in direct conflict with the terms of the National Labor Relations Act as well as the Administrative Procedure Act . The former law provides for a court review of board orders . The latter law , together with the normal equity jurisdiction of the Federal courts , provides for review of capricious action by an administrative agency . Powers Circumscribed Likewise , Mr. Perkins ' contention that the board 's real reason for abolishing the office of general counsel is to " expound labor relations doctrine for the nation 's guidance " is in direct conflict with the terms of the act itself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Labor Relations Act . Whenever the board steps beyond the circle which encloses its powers and duties , the United States courts , including the Supreme Court , have not been loath to correct the board . An analysis of the actual conditions and provisions , under which the board operates , will demonstrate that the board and the general counsel represent ' opposite magnetic poles , exerting their powers in different directions to the confusion of unions and employers alike . Once this disrupting factor in the procedure under the act is obliterated by the abolition of the office of general counsel , it is submitted that the national labor policy calling for true collective bargaining in good faith between employers and unions alike , will be furthered . At , present , the division of power , under an act setting a unified goal makes only for confusion and weakening of the national labor policy . HENRY MAYER . New York , May 12 , 1950 . Further reproduction prohibited without permission . publicans and Democrats alike would welcome . Under present-day conditions ( and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly never ) the Government can not help but meddle with the private citizen 's affairs . Previously , equality of opportunity could be maintained by a do-nothing state . Conditions being what they are today , equality of opportunity can not be guaranteed without state intervention . This means that the people look to the parties for an answer to the question : How far do you propose to go in controlling our lives and in what manner ? Any party that fails to answer that question will not win an election today . The time when a party could get into office on a purely negative program is gone , just as are the conditions that made the do-nothing state the best form of government . That the absence of a program in politics means defeat today has nowhere been brought out more clearly than in the post-war elections in England and the Presidential campaign of 1948 in this country . Mr. Dewey lost the election with practically an unbeatable hand , had 1948 been 1848 . He lost for the very simple reason that he was playing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no party is going to win an election on a program of denial , by calling the opposition 's chief " the worst President ever to occupy the White House .

Carlos Romulo Concentration of Appointments Called Testimony to His Gifts The writer of the following letter is the former editor of The Iloilo Times , an English-language newspaper published in the Philippines . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorial " For the Philippine Cause " on May 2 on Gen. Carlos P. Romulo was very heartwarming and in line with your consistent championship of the Philippines and its people . I am sure that your editorial opinions are scrutinizes with utmost respect in the official and press circles in Manila and the provinces . On the subject of General Romulo , whose star is still rising , it might be pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts in the Government has no precedent . It seems to me that his appointment to the ambassadorships to the U. N. and to the United States , heading the Manila Foreign Office at the same time , are not so much the demand of the austerity program of the home Government as the singular recognition of his unusual abilities . If a man of Romulo 's stature were not procurable , three men would have been sought for the three jobs . At this juncture the projected Southeast Asia conference , a Philippine obsession , would need a Romulo to guide it and carry it through . President Quirino should be given credit for harnessing Romulo 's talents to the maximum . For all the things written about Carlos Romulo in the United States , I do not think it is known that he started as a Manila cub reporter and rose spectacularly until shortly before the war to be the foremost editor and publisher in the Philippines and one of the most vigorous in the Far East . His English professorship at the University of the Philippines was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attracted by his oratorical and writing power , and he leaned on Romulo for so many things . As Quezon 's star rose , Romulo 's rose with it . War came and he was yanked out of his position as publisher of a chain of newspapers English , Spanish and Tagalog into the army and became an important liaison man between Quezon and . As Bataan fell he was ordered out of the Philippines to the United States , where he lectured and wrote books to help in the war effort . Then came bigger posts like the Resident Commissionership in the United States Congress and the chairmanship of the Filipino delegation to the San Francisco Conference . Today Romulo is a hero of the Filipinos . He combines two rare gifts . He can talk and he can write  --  and both with moving eloquence . High school and college students imitate him . He has become their idol . Since he became President of the last U. N. General Assembly , even intransigent powerful political leaders at home listen to him . REx D.
