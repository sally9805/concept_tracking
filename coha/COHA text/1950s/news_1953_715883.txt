txt Tep American officials in the Orient are convinced there will be no more fighting in Korea unless something touches off World War III . At the same time , they see little chance now for peaceful unification of Korea since the treaty signed this week between Communist China and North Korea in effect moved China 's border southward almost to paralleI.38 . South Korea 's President Rhee has threatened to order his 16 American-trained divisions northward unless a peace conference makes progress toward uniting his country by Jan. 27 ? six months after the Korean armistice was signed . U.S. Troop Exit Hinted But generals and diplomats who have visited Korea during the past month say Mr. Rhee will not reopen the war . They cite these reasons for their belief : 1 . Mr .. Rhee has been told the United States will withdraw its forces from Korea if he rekindles the war . 2 . ROK forces have only enough ammunition for skx days if the United States shuts'off the quartermaster supply faucets. 3 . Mr. Rhee would n't risk losing almost a billion dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher circles here tharresponNorth Korea Hard Hit The only thing that would make the United States troops go into action in Korea again would be for the Communists to start- shooting . In that case American troops , sailors , and airmen would fight again . But the fighting would not be restricted to ** top officials say . There is no doubt now , in the minds of Far Eastern observers , but that North Korea is a satellite of Communist China . Prisoners coming home from the camps in North Korea reported the destruction of the country . Some ventured to say AIM fewer than three million of the onetime population of nine million remained in North Korea . It will take a lot of aid to rebuild North Korea  --  a lot more than it will to rebuild South Korea . The United States already has promised Mr. Rhee nearly a billion dollars . Mr. Rhee 's greatest love is his country . No one in authority here expects him to turn his back on a billion dollars ,          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
