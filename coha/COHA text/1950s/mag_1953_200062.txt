For the men at the front , the last day was the longest . In nine languages , they heard the cease-fire order on bunker radios . Many grinned as they listened to their lieutenants and captains read them the message from Eighth Army Commander Maxwell Taylor : " There is no occasion for celebration and boisterous conduct . We are faced with the same enemy , only a short distance away , and must be ready for any move he makes . " <P> In the air , allied warplanes roared off for North Korean targets , then were called back to their bases with full bombloads . More than 200 F-86 Sabre jets patrolled Mig Alley for the last time , found no MIG-158 willing to fight . The last plane shot down : a Russian-made IL-12 transport , which might have been carrying some of the Red officials who witnessed the signing at Panmunjom . <P> But across the front , hours after the : truce agreement was signed , the big guns roared . U.N . artillerymen were under orders not to shoot unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slug it out until the 10 p.m. bell . The Communists fired round after round at U.N . trenches ; the Eighth Army guns fired back at the Red cannon . Said one marine wounded on the last day : " I guess those fellows on the other side did n't get the word . " <P> On cease-fire night , a full moon hung like a Halloween lantern in the sky . At 9:45 p.m. , command radios crackled : all shooting from the U.N . side is to-stop . <P> The barrage died down , but the smell of cordite hung in the air . At two seconds before 10 p.m. , a crop-haired battalion commander took a soggy cigar from his mouth , flicked a switch , and called his companies : " Thanks for sticking out the war . You 'll be all right now if you do n't step on a mine on the way back . " At the ist Marine Division , a bugler played taps . Despite the sober warnings , men dashed from their bunkers , shed their flak jackets , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man 's land that was suddenly safe .
