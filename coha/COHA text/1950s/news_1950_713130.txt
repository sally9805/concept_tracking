txt Cigarette smokers by the end of the week will be paying up to 1 cent more a package for most popular brands , tobacco trade executives predicted yesterday . The forecast was a reaction within the industry to the announcement of higher wholesale prices made in Winston-Salem , N. C. , yesterday by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company , manufacturer of Camel and Cavalier cigarettes . While other major companies declined comment , wholesale and retail trade spokesmen declared that , on the basis of past Changes in cigarette prices , , the increase quickly would become general . A general rise ' would return the average package price in New York to the record high that prevailed in the latter half of 1948 . That was the last time popular brands of cigarettes sold at more than 20 cents a pack . In its announcement ' the Reynolds Company said its wholesale The price of milk in grocery stores here will go up 1 cent a quart on Tuesday and the homedelivered price will advance 1% cents . This was assured , yesterday when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of increases and smaller dealers indicated that they would follow suit . The price changes , which will affect sweet and sour cream , too , were said to be the result of a. rise in the official price farmers will receive for their milk during August . However , the farm rise will be the equivalent of only about I , three-quarters of a cent a quart . Sheffield Farms , which announced the new retail prices first , ' said top officials of the company were unavailable for comment about the discrepancy . The Bor-1 den 's Farm Products division of the Borden Company , which issued an identical new price list several // price was being increased from $7.75 to $8 a thousand , subject to the usual discounts . Increased costs , especially higher prices of leaf tobacco , were cited as the cause . The- statement noted that the change would mean an increase of less than one-half cent a package . Retail sources here said that it was extremely unlikely that retailers other than chain organizations would absorb the increase ; they added that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 cents for two . Prices of cartons probably will rise in New York from $1.7541.80 to $1.85-$1.90 . In New Jersey , where cigarette prices are set by law , the carton price would rise from $1.87 to $1.92 . The price of single packages in New Jersey has been 19 cents , in Connecticut 19 cents and in Pennsylvania 20 to 21 cents . All of these are expected to go up one cent each . Some retailers were reported yesterday to be concerned over the possibility that the wholesalers would put on a further increase of their own in passing on a manufacturers ' increase . However ; an official of a distributor organization said that such action was most unlikely . The higher ' cost of leaf tobacco cited by the Reynolds Company age rate of 45 cents a pound , compared to 42.5 on 1949 crops . Higher freight rates and labor costs also were said to be factors in advancing manufacturing costs . Except for relatively minor and sporadic price wars in some areas , and the maintenance of lower prices by retailers using cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 20 cents would be ruinous for the average dealer , it was contended . The retail mark-up on cigarettes generally is not more than 10 per cent . MILK PRICES HERE TO GO UP TUESDAY // hours later , also had no explanation . In other areas of the industry , though , the move was interpreted as a step toward ending the price " war " that started last October when Sheffield unexpectedly cut the cost of its milk from 1 cent to 21/2 cents a quart . As a result of Sheffield 's surprise action other dealers cut their prices , too , but complained that i they were losing money . In May sixteen independent dairies sued ' the National Dairy Products Corporation and twelve of its subsidiaries , including Sheffield , for $3,501,022 triple damages , charg ing that " unreasonably low prices " had been set in an effort to eliminate competition . A few weeks ago the damages sought were raised to $9,000,000 . With Sheffield again taking the . lead in establishing general price levels , the independents , whose business is mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onequarter of a cent a quart " relief , " it was said . However , Sydney Wertheimer of the law firm Weisman , Quinn , Allan &; Spatt , - which is handling the independents ' case , said about 11/2 cents a quart was what was needed and indicated that the case would be continued . Automatic Advances Expected The new increases will bring the average price for milk in grocery stores to a shade under 19 cents a quart , it was believed . There is a customary range of a few cents depending on whether the milk is standard approved or homogenized and whether it is sold in glass bottles or cardboard containers . Although retailers are not obligated to increase their prices , the fact that the prices that they will be paying to dealers will go up an even 1 cent was expected to bring automatic advances . The new home-delivered prices for both Sheffield and Borden 's will be 21 cents a quart.for standard milk and 22 cents for homogenized , both in glass bottles . Buttermilk and chocolate ? milk also will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 cent a halfphit ; heavy sweet cream , 2 cents a half-pint , and sour cream , 2 cents a pint . 2 Cents Lower Than Last Year . In its announcement , Sheffield said that milk prices would still be 2 cents lower than last August , despite a 1-cent-a-quart rise on July 1 and the new increase . The July advance followed a farm rise of the equivalent of 1 cent a quart , ordered by the Secretary of Agriculture and the State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets . Under the tennis of the Federal - state marketing order governing milk destined for this area , they had set the farm price at $4.58 a hundred pounds . This month 's price , arrived at under a new formula being used for the first time , will be $4.92 . Since the new formula uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics commodity price index as an important factor , and this index has been tending to rise , further milk increases were considered probable in the coming months .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
