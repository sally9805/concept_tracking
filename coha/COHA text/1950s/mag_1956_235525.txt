" Communism , " said Lenin , " is Soviet Authority plus electrification . " Since then , five Five-Year Plans have come and gone . Soviet Authority is still supreme , but the electrification of Russia hardly extends beyond the big cities . Last week Lenin 's successors announced a sixth Five-Year Plan , the main feature of which was a bracket of atomic power stations with a total capacity of some 2.5 million kilowatts . <P> Actually each successive Five-Year Plan ( piatiletka ) is a set of production targets which the state planners then exhort the Russian people to attain by superhuman effort . The sixth piatiletka ( 1956-60 ) is more than usually superhuman : in the next five years heavy industry must be up 70% , pig iron up 70% , steel up 51% , coal up 49% , oil up 100% , building up 52% , consumer goods up 60% ; in agriculture grain production must increase 80% , while labor efficiency on state farms must rise 70% , on collectives 100% . Incentives are a calculated feature of piatiletki : 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , with wages up 30% ; there will be 50% more technicians and specialists and more than twice as many hospital beds . Airports are to be reconstructed , air freight is to be doubled , and new fast passenger planes are to ply feeder routes . But , faithful to the Leninist dream ( in Russia , electric light bulbs are ironically called Ilyich after Lenin 's patronymic ) , the big story was electric power : an overall increase from 160 to 320 billion kilowatts . No mention was made of the larger atomic-energy target for 1960 , but an atomic-powered transarctic liner with special hydraulic ice-melting monitors was promised . <P> The sixth Five-Year Plan will be the subject of endless stakhanovite speech-making in coming months , but Russian workers may well recall an exhortation made by Stalin of an earlier piatiletka : " We are 50 to 100 years behind the advanced countries . We have to run this distance in ten years . Either we do this or we disintegrate . " That was a quarter of a century ago . Even in the unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of the U.S.S.R. in 1960 , experts calculate , will be only two-thirds that of the U.S. at the present moment .
