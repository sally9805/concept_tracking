There is a provocative passage in The Folks at Home , latest book by Margaret Halsey ( With Malice Toward Some ) . It is : " . . . The word ' communications ' is misleading . ' Communication ' in the dictionary sense means a two-way exchange . But who ever argues with a movie ? Who talks back to TIME and LIFE ? To assume that no body wants to is taking too much for granted . " <P> I agree that it would be taking too much for granted . I have always assumed that everybody wants to talk back to TIME-and does . Many of you frequently talk back , in your letters , in person , and in other ways . And we hope that you will go right on doing so . We are listening . <P> Without listening-to thousands of people every week-TIME 'S correspondents , researchers and writers could not hope to report the news with any degree of authority . At the same time , they are also listening to what is being said about TIME , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important public issues . I am sure TIME 'S editors share with me the fre quent experience of being launched into long discussions about TIME-both at the office and away from it . Not long ago , for example , I was a guest on the television program Youth Wants to Know , where a group of high-school students subjected me to some of the most searching questions about the meaning and motives of journalism that I have ever encountered . <P> At least one member of TIME 'S staff currently has a full-time job of personal communication . He is John Scott , about whom I wrote you in this space last year ( Oct. 6 ) . He speaks before college audiences and groups of busi nessmen . <P> Scott discusses world events , but he also explains some of TIME 'S beliefs about journalism . He probably experiences more back-talking from the people he meets than anyone else on TIME 'S staff . The students are usually most outspoken , challenging him with such questions as : Is TIME objective ? The answer : TIME has certain basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluate the news in the light of these convictions . We have seen a similar approach being shared by an increasing number of people who deal with the news . One recent example is an editorial in Palmer Hoyt 's Denver Post , which said : " The pure factual objectivity which most newspapers have sought has often been a will-o ' - the- wisp . . . Who , what , where , when and why no longer answer all the questions . ' What does it mean ? ' is an important question that newspapers will try , increasingly , to answer . " <P> A related question that Scott is often asked : Does TIME 'S interpretive journalism usurp the reader 's right to do his own thinking ? That could be answered most simply by referring to the letters through which many of you talk back to TIME , and in which you clearly exercise the right to do your own thinking . The answers to your letters , written by members of TIME 'S Letters department , make it evident , I hope , that TIME does listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Letters department distributes , to the staff , a mimeographed summary of the mail that reaches us , called the TIME Letters Report . Because the Letters section in the magazine has space for only a few of the thousands of letters you send us , this report is compiled to give TIME 'S staff a better idea of what our readers are writing . TIME 'S editors read the Letters Report avidly .
