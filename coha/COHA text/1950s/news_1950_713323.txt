txt WASHINGTON , Oct. 14 ? The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has accused the American Bar . Association of using funds granted for impartial Work for peace and law through the United Nations to fight one of the Administration 's principal world-wide programs . Whatever might remain of the endowment 's $15,000 grant to the association may not be spent without specific written approval from it , the Carnegie group has ruled . At issue is the genocide convention which President Truman has submitted to the Senate for ratification , This convention seeks to outlaw the extermination of national , ethnical , racial or religious groups . The Senate is expected to make its decision after it reconvenes late in November . The Carnegie endowment has // concluded , it was learned today , that while its grant to the bar group sought a furtherance of objective approaches to such questions as genocide , a committee of the national bar body was campaigning against the convention as it was approved by a Senate subcommittee . This situation was disclosed in a letter written on Sept , 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar association , by Joseph E. Thompson of New York , president of the Carnegie . endowment . At one point in his letter Mr. Thompson said : . " In view of the unfortunate lack of precision in the agreement under which the grant of $15,000 was made , I am not requesting . that the American Bar Association return : whatever balance may remain . " I do request , however , that you instruct the chairman of the Special Committee on Peace and Law Through United Nations ( identified as William . L. Ransom ) , to refrain in future from employing any of the endowment 's grant for purposes of influencing public or Congressional attitudes with respect to matters pending before the Congress or either House thereof , except with written approval of the endowment . " The Bar Association has condemned genocide , but has taken the position that the convention might supersede American courts and the self-governing powers of American ' states , and pose constitutional questions .. " It is my conviction , " Mr. Thompson wrote , " that endowment funds should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grants-in-aid to influence public opinion on controversial issues or decisions of the Congress or either House- thereof on pending matters , except on the basis of a specific policy decision of the endowment 's board of trustees . * " Despite repeated requests , the endowment has never received a - report from the American Bar Association on the uses to which the grant of $15,000 has been put . The only reports we have received have been very brief financial statements . The only significant facts revealed by these reports are ( a ) that the endowment 's and bar association 's ( on a sort of matching basis ) grants were put into a common fund , and ( b ) that there was an unexpended balance of $6,349.39 on Dec. 31 , 1949 . " It seems fair to assume , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , that the publications of the special committee ( in opposition to the genocide convention ) were paid from this fund . * * " From these documents ( the committee publications ) it is clear to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant from the ehdowment has been violated . It appears probable also that at least some of the funds granted have been employed in support of  --  an ex parte position . "
