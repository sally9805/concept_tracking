Since World War II , Chairman Robert E. Wood of Sears , Roebuck &; Co. , No. i mail-order house , has gone in for freehanded expansion , spent around $300 million to increase its retail outlets from 610 to 694 and another $26 million to open 24 stores in Latin America . On the other hand , crusty old Sewell L. Avery , 80 , chairman of Montgomery Ward &; Co. , the No. 2 mail-order house , has been expecting a bad depression , has closed down an estimated 31 stores and shortened leases on others . <P> Last week the results of both policies were reflected in earnings statements for 1953 . Sears 's sales bulged to a record $2,981,925,186 , up 1.7% , and earnings were up even more , from $110 million to $118 million . Ward 's sales fell 7.9% to $999,123,379 ( below $1 billion for the first time since 1946 ) , and net profit dropped from $49 million to $41 million . But in one balance-sheet figure , cautious Montgomery Ward- " the only bank with a store front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its cash of $23 million and Government securities of $270 million were equal to about $45 a share on the 6,502,378 shares outstanding . Sears owed $200 million , and its $320 million in cash and $9,000,000 in securities equaled only about $13.50 a share on their 24,210,454 outstanding shares . But investors seemed to prefer a company that has its cash working in the business to one that puts its money into safe , low-yield investments . Ward 's stock had been edging down in the last year while Sears 's has held steady . Stock prices at week 's end : Ward 's 59 , Sears 's 59 ? .
