In 38 years of soldiering , James Alward Van Fleet has served his country well in France , Germany , Greece and Korea . But what may prove to be one of General Van Fleet 's greatest services was performed on Capitol Hill two weeks ago : he told the Senate Armed Services Committee that throughout his 22 months as commander of the Eighth Army in Korea he and his U.N . troops had been plagued by " a serious shortage of ammunition " ( TIME , March 16 ) . Charges of an ammunition shortage had been made before and brushed off before . Van Fleet 's reputation was too solid to brush off . <P> Last week , at the demand of the Senate Armed Services Committee , the Pentagon 's bosses , civilian and Army , paraded to Capitol Hill to give their answer to Van Fleet 's charge . Defense Secretary Charles E. Wilson , in the immemorial manner of civilian service chiefs , did his best to back up his uniformed Washington subordinates ; he read a brief statement declaring that the ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General J. Lawton ( " Lightnin ' Joe " ) Collins implied that Van Fleet , like most combat commanders , had an insatiable appetite for ammunition . The fact is , said Collins , that in 1952 the Eighth Army fired an average of 62,616 rounds of mortar and artillery ammunition a day-nearly ten times the enemy 's average daily rate of fire . But such Pentagon efforts to persuade the Senators to look at the silver lining collapsed when Virginia 's Harry Byrd put a question to Army Secretary Robert Ten Broeck Stevens . <P> Byrd : You do not deny there is an ammunition shortage ? And can you speak for Mr. Wilson : he does not deny there is an ammunition shortage ? <P> Stevens : Correct . <P> " Unsatisfactory . " The Army had a second line of defense : perhaps the disagreement between Collins and Van Fleet could be explained by different definitions of " shortage . " As the hearing went on , however , it became clear that the Army had a shortage of ammunition by anybody 's definition . Van Fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition on the firing line . At times , he said , there was not enough to support counterbattery fire or to cope with Chinese " human sea " attacks . All the Pentagon witnesses conceded that in the past reserve stocks in Korea had fallen dangerously low . Under questioning by Harry Byrd , General Collins finally admitted that , so far as ammunition supplies were concerned , the lull following the July 1951 armistice talks in Korea had come as a desperately needed respite . <P> Pentagon spokesmen made much of the fact that the Korean shortage was no longer critical . Today , said Defense Secretary Wilson , the Eighth Army has " the ammunition necessary for operations on the present scale . " To some of the Senators , Wilson 's statement sounded like another way of saying that the Eighth Army did not have ammunition enough for operations on a bigger scale . <P> If that was true in Korea , which has top priority in ammunition , what was the situation in Europe ? Or in the strategic reserve stocks at home ? Said Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs has been unsatisfactory and still is . " He added that the supply was " gradually improving . "
