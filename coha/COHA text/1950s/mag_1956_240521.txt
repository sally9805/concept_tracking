Since World War II , mounting expenses have kept hospital administrators awake nights . This week in Hospitals , monthly journal of the American Hospital Association , the University of Chicago Clinics ' Dr. Ray E. Brown explains how much , and why , the bills for hospitalization have grown in nine years . Some facts and figures : <P> Forced as never before to compete with industry for technicians and unskilled labor , the nation 's top general hospitals have more than doubled wages , cut four hours off the work week ( to 40 hours ) . While industry is cutting manpower needs per job with automation , new medical techniques have increased the need for hospital employees by 34% per patient . Result : the average daily cost to the patient has climbed 132% , from $9.39 to $21.76 , or almost four times faster than prices in general . Increased efficiency has cut the average patient 's stay in bed from 9.1 to 7.8 days , but intensified care and new techniques , e.g. , blood chemistry tests and X rays , raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the annual total of patients per bed has gone up 11% in the nine years , rapid turnover has actually decreased the daily percentage of available beds in use . While demand for beds fluctuates widely , costly overhead remains the same . For example , 61 Chicago area hospitals reported that the percentage of maternity unit beds occupied ranged from 37% to 101% in one year , with the same full staff on hand throughout . <P> Administrator Brown sees little relief for patient or hospital in the immediate future . If they were to cut payroll , hospitals would lose competent people , lower efficiency , undermine the care of the sick . Predicts Brown : " Unless there is a depression , we must expect hospital costs to continue to increase at about 5% annually for many years . "
