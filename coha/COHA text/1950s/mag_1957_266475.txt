Backhand , Forehand <P> Sir : <P> I must protest your Aug. 26 issue of TIME with Althea Gibson on the cover . We have enough trouble with these people without paying for a magazine which carries such news . You will ruin your magazine if you continue to run such articles . Do n't do it again . <P> R. M. SHAW <P> Philadelphia <P> Sir : <P> I 'll accept Kim Novak , Khrushchev , and even Chief Justice Warren on your covers , but I 'm afraid I could n't stand your Althea Gibson cover around the house . <P> JOHN E. MEEKS <P> Baton Rouge <P> Sir : <P> The insight you portrayed in your story on Althea Gibson was very heartwarming . She is a tribute to her race and a great credit not only to tennis but to all American athletes and I believe she will be the " best woman tennis player who ever lived . " <P> SALLIE SURRIDGE <P> New York City <P> <P> Prices , Wages &; Inflation <P> Sir : <P> In your Aug. 5 discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , pensions . It is very obvious that when a person is promised that he will receive an adequate income in later life he will proceed to spend more of his present income than he would in other circumstances . He has no further need to save and so he spends . <P> <P> RICHARD SCOTT <P> The Bronx , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> You said " . . . the increased wage levels set the stage for rise in prices to come-and more inflation . " This points a moral for organized labor , but will they stop grabbing for more ? Hell no . Not until they have gone through the bottom of the grab bag . Then the only comfort they will have is a feeling of togetherness as they queue up in the soup lines . How long will organized labor pursue this madcap race that will end with the dollarless dollar ? <P> DONALD JOHN GIESE <P> Minneapolis <P> The New Secretary <P> Sir : <P> Your Aug. 19 box on Secretary of Defense McElroy and Procter &; Gamble reminds me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical warfare inspectors in training , I was sent to a P. &; G.-operated shell-loading plant in Tennessee to observe the handling of explosives . P. &; G. maintained a discipline in regard to safety rules that is still a goal with me in my present role as teacher and mother . If Mr. McElroy can apply to the Pentagon some of the principles that were of paramount importance in P. &; G. 's plant , he 'll come through with flying colors . <P> MARY C. KELLEY <P> Lithonia , Ga . <P> Sir : <P> The job should have been offered to the one man who knows more about it than any other man in America-General Douglas MacArthur . <P> EDWARD CLARKE <P> The Bronx , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> I certainly feel sorry for those 30,000 Procter &; Gamble employees if their company had net sales of $1,038,290 in 1956 and Mr. McElroy received $285,000 of it . <P> <P> ALAN Q. ESCHENROEDER <P> Ithaca , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> Soapmaker Neil McElroy 's sudsy salary apparently left a dash of P. &; G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm 's net sales in ' 56 at such a paltry low-Tide million plus figure . I think it should be $1,038,290,374 . <P> <P> WILLIAM F. KINDER Lieutenant , U.S.N.R. San Diego <P> TIME slipped on a cake of Ivory . - ED . <P> <P> The Iron Master <P> Sir :
