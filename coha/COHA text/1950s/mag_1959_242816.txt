" Attention , Moscow speaking , " the announcer boomed , and his words were heard around the world . " Today , the 14th of September , at 00:02:24 , Moscow time , the second Soviet cosmic rocket reached the surface of the moon . It is the first time in history that a cosmic flight has been made from the earth to another celestial body . " The Soviet moon rocket , with a last-stage weight of 3,342 Ibs. , treated against bacteria so as not to contaminate the surface of the moon , carried red pennants and a hammer-and-sickle emblem inscribed " The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , 1959 . " <P> This new triumph of Soviet science ( see SCIENCE ) , following almost exactly two years after Sputnik 1 , showed that the U.S.S.R. is still ahead of the U.S. in the critical field of space . The U.S.S.R. fired two moon rockets into space , missed once , hit once ; the U.S. fired five moon rockets , missed five times . The Soviet success , as such , gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his U.S. visit , perhaps the greatest prestige blast-off of all time . <P> The U.S. , no less than the U.S.S.R. , tingled with the news of man 's new scientific leap beyond the earth 's atmosphere . " We wish , " said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , " to congratulate our fellow scientists . "
