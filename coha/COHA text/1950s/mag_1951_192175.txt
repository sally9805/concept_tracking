Hell-for-leather abstractionists such as Jackson Pollock , Robert Motherwell and Willem de Kooning have kept Manhattan art circles spinning all season . Their swirls , blobs and blizzards of paint , most of them too haphazard for analytical discussion , drew cheers and jeers , started scores of cocktail-party tiffs . <P> A California critic named Jules Langsner finally capped the argument with a shrewd belch , in the current Arts &; Architecture magazine . Reviewing a traveling show including such abstractions , he observed that they " evoke all kinds of muffled after-sensations , but not individuated images in the mind 's eye . It is as if vision had been converted to gastrointestinal equivalents , so that when the doctor asks you just where you feel the pain , the best you can say is that ' it 's down here somewheres . ' " <P> To get to the bottom of the bellyache , Langsner quoted and neatly skewered Painter Motherwell 's introduction to the show 's catalogue . ' ' The process of painting these pictures , " Motherwell had explained , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of persons of intelligence . . . and passion . " <P> Retorted Langsner : adventure for its own sake is not enough-it should be a byproduct of exploration . " In the long run , the exploring artist returns with more loot because he sees more ; he sees more because his sense of purpose alerts him to what he himself can find rather than what will turn up by accident .
