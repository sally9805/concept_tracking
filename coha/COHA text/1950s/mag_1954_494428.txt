BY A NARROW , party line vote , a Congressional Committee that no longer speaks for the majority has moved the Dixon-Yates contract one step nearer completion . It goes now to the Securities Exchange Commission , the Congress and perhaps the Courts . Detail by detail , the contract will be debated by the Democrats and discussed in the press . And yet the contract , in its revised form , is no worse than others signed by the Atomic Energy Commission . It is being resisted , while they were approved , because it has come to dramatize and symbolize two developments : the willingness of the Eisenhower Administration to ex ? ploit the AEC for political objectives and the hostility o SIGNPOST marks the edge of the region where the streams begin to widen on their way to Chicka ? mauga Dam . No hint of atomic bomb plants down the valley is offered by the Virginia towns whose names.are Max Meadows and Rural Retreat . But radar eyes sweep the horizon there , alert for all intruders . Six Minutes after I crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knoxville , a silver jet inter ? ceptor flashed under the wing of my plane . Three times it circled in voracious arcs and with loaded guns bore down upon me out of the morning mist . The pilot . looked me over as he passed and concluded that I was harmless . With an expulsion of dark smoke , like a flee- ing squid , the interceptor returned to its vigil in the stratosphere . If the jet pilot was puzzled , I was paralyzed , . But as . I thawed out I realized that this was , after all , a logical introduction to a region transformed in the course of 20 years from a rural slum to the strategic center of the nation . TVA had brought about that transformation . And TVA 's uncertain future was the reason for my flight . Days of Congressional testimony on the Dixon-Yates contract had made it plain that the issue was not the six percent of the region 's power supply that the Dixon-Yates plant was to provide but . the 94 percent already provided by TVA . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nine-percent orof the ' Administration to the Tennessee Valley Au ? thority . The editors of the New Republics believe that TVA is in danger and that its continued development or slow decay will be one of the great domestiC issues of the next two years . Our attitude toward TVA 's past ac complishments is well known to our readers . But TVA 's own role has changed , and President Eisen ? hower has placed the opposition to TVA on new grounds . His argument must be considered and is well worth considering . Accordingly , the NR 's editor traveled through the region in late October to reap praise the TVA in current terms . In this , the first of three articles , he reports the views of representative Southerners toward TVA 's basic achievement . The second article will interpret the present conflict over TVA as seen from the valley . the third will consider the alternatives before TVA. a seven-percent return , but whether TVA itself was still a national asset and a means of promoting a better life for the six million residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised that question and reached a tentative conclusion : TVA was ' part of the dread disease that President Eisenhower called " creeping socialism . " Speaking at McNary Dam on October 5 , the President declared , in an obvious refer ? ence to TVA , that the " malignant bureaucracy " of No ? ernment , once injected into a region inevitably robbed it of morale and initiative and finally of the will to survive free . It was a grave charge , one which , if true , would the prompt dismantling of TVA .. It was to test the charge , to reappraise the fundamental impact of TVA and only then to consider its present plight that I flew in late October to Alabama where the hook of the Ten ? nessee River turns to the northwest . We sat in the Why Not Eat Here Cafe in the main street of Decatur and Quince Edens , the manager of the city 's Electric Department , . poked the man beside him in the ribs . " I see where Ike s power bill is going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled , and asked why . " Down here , " said Barrett Shelton the editor old publisher of the Decatur Daily , we may vote against Ike but we try hard to like him . We do n't see how any man as decent as Ike can be so wrong about the TVA . " We were sitting around one night , and puzzling and one of us said , ' I bet Ike never paid a power bill in all his life ? that 's why he do n't understand . ' So we decided that if Ike did n't have the facts about his own power bills , we 'd get them for him , and we did . " " You know , " said Shelton , " we figured a 25-percent write-up , or even a 35-percent write-up would be about right for that private utility that supplies the White House . But darn if we did n't find that the White House rates are 75 percent above Decatur 's ! Why , we figured Ike could save himself $4,000 a year if Quince here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike . We never got a reply . There is n't a man in Decatur thinks our letter ever got past the palace guard that put Ike up to this attack on TVA . " Out in the hot sun , we paused on the sidewalk as every passing farmer and tradesman stopped Ettens and slapped him on the back . He was Quince to every man , and they were George and Fred . Watching him , a stocky , humorous than in his shirt-sleeves , I tried and failed to clothe him in the image of the malignant , bureaucrat that Eisenhower had drawn in fear of TVA . " Malignant bureaucracy , " cried Ettens when Lquoted the President . " There 's your malignant bureaucracy ! " We were sitting in his office in the brand new building of the Electric Department and he pointed to the gentle and smiling Barrett Shelton . " I 'm responsible to a board of three Decatur men ? a brick mainfaeturer , an insuranrP salesman and Barrett here . They 're responsible directly to the people . They get $15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man would politick hisself on the board for the money ) . And if the people decide they 're not worth it , they throw them out . " " Maybe the President meant the TVA officials , " said . " Look , " said Ettens , " we , run this power board . The TVA never gave an order in its life , . neither to us , nor to the other 150 distributors that retail its power . The Tennessee Valley Authority is under contract to us , that 's all . That contract requires us to keep rates down , and to set aside adequate reserves . That 's the way it has to be or some of the weaker boards in the Valley might give in to temptation . Apart from that the word Authority does n't belong in the vocabulary of the Valley . I wish they 'd never ' thought it up ! " " Well , " ' I said , " you do n't look too malignant to me . " Quince grinned . " Everybody in . Decatur kicks me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banty rooster , the superintendent of education , has got the brass of a brass monkey when it comes to me . He caught me the other day at the Kiwanians and he said , ' Quince , how come You do n't make a cheap rate for the schools ? ' ' Look , Mister , ' I said , ' my ' department pays $10,000 a year in taxes just as a contribution to your schools . Then we save you another $5,000 a year in electric rates . With-c'ut my department you would n't even have a new high school to ask special rates for ! ' " Maybe I misstated the President 's argument , " I said . " His real point is that federal aid slowly drains a region of its vitality and enterprise . " " Listen , " said Quince , " I was raised and educated by the Alabama Power Company and I know the meal the utilities feed the President . It 's poison . " " When I came here 16 years , ago , " said Ettens , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decatur . Now we have 75,000 . " He reached in his drawer for a sheaf of papers but Maynard Layman , Vice President , Circulation Manager , Farm Editor and general handyman of the Decatur Daily , intervened . " Let 's not tell him the answer to that one . Let 's , let him see for himself what 's happened to vitality and enterprise in Decatur in the 20 years since TVA came to the Valley . " five-cent cotton . The farms were foreclosed . And seven of the eight banks in the county quit . " Oh , there was n't a corner in the nation more flat broke than Decatur . Why I remember when Old Man ? Barrett that is ? talked Goodyear into coming to look over the mill . That was in 1933 and Old Man had to walk sideways through the streets beside the Goodyear official to hide all the patches in his pants . " " When TVA came in , " said Layman , " we were all against it . We did n't care about cheap power then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs from other parts of the country , And the power . company had helped us . So we fought TVA . " Layman handed me a pamphlet . " Read this : Old Man describes what happened back in 1934 . " I read : Into this dismal setting one late midwinter after ? noon came David Lilienthal , then a member of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority . Four of our citizens who had long been hopeful of improving conditions met him in conference . We were almost frankly hostile , for he represented to us another way of thought and another way of life . Our conversation might be summarized in this fashion : " All ? right , you 're here , you were not invited , but you 're here . You are in command now , what are you going to do ? " Dave leaned his chair back against the wall and the twinkle of a smile came into his eyes as he said gently and firmly , " I 'm not going to do anything . You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that TVA would provide the tools of opportunity ? flood control , malaria control , naviga ? tion on the river , low-cost power , test-demonstration farming to show how our soil could be returned to fer ? tility , a fertility lost through land erosion , another wayward child of a one-crop system . " What you do with these tools , " he said , " is up to you . " T HE CAR stopped outside a new hosiery mill . We went inside and Layman put his arm around the shoulder of a young company executive . " One of my , news ? . boys , " he said . " They 're in every plant in town ! " We walked between pounding looms and lines ' of women sewing . The pay sheets showed an average wage of $1.32 an hour for the women , and $2.25 for the men . " TVA brought us power , " said Layman , back in the car , " but it was n't just cheap power that gave us that mill . You know , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution was to bring not cheap power but a change , in our thinking ' . " " Read some more , " said Layman as we drove on . The pamphlet continued : Later Dr. Harcourt Morgan , another member of the TVA Board of Directors , came to us . . . . " What a night that was ! " Layman interrupted . " We met in the American Legion hall on the second story ofa furniture store , and the old stove overheated and al ? most burned the place down ! Go on . . . " He talked to us about lime and phosphate and legumes and the relationship of people and the land . ? ? " He sure did ! " said Layman . " And none of us un ? derstood a word of it ! You ? see we were uneducated then . We were a way down on the . totem pole , and it took us six weeks and a stack of old dictionaries to figure out what the Doctor had said . Keep reading ! " I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he speak of the need for farm markets and farm proces ? sing plants and of increasing the value of our farm products through manufacturing processes . He op ? posed the tearing down of other sections of the United States by seeking their industry with subsidy , the promise of cheap electricity and poorly paid labor . He told our people the simple story of making the most of what we had , of developing our own natural resources , of putting to work the little capital that we owned , of growing our own industry based upon the resources of the land . . . . We decided then and there that . . . we had to pioneer an entirely new plan of economics . . . . " Old Man wo n't take the credit , " said Layman , " but he started a Chamber of Commerce with the last $3,000 in town . Then he and two bankers went down to Moul trie to talk about the boll weevil , and they came back with peanuts and pigs . . . . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Those towers are the flour mills that TVA navigation brought in . We never grew grain in this county until TVA came . Now those trucks are unloading part of a $3 million crop of grain our farmers grow each year for what they call the Biscuit and Bible Belt . . . . " . ? . That 's the seed cleaning plant . The TVA brought in phosphates . We had to import vetch from Oregon . We found we could grow it here , but we could n't clean it . . . . So he sent out a group to the Willamette Valley to study cleaning and the Tennessee Valley Fertilizer Co operative put up the plant .. : . " . . . That 's the shipbuilding yard . . . . TVA naviga ? tion again . . . . That 's Clancy 's lumberyard. . . an old individualist Republican if there ever was one , but the British newsprint firm of Bowaters came to the Valley because of TVA 's reforestation policy and Clancy saw some slabs of timber going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a debarking machine . He chops up the slabs and sells them to Bowaters and now he 's putting up docks for river navigation as well . . . At one end of the waterfront was Wolverine Tube : a copper processing plant a third of a ' mile long , placed in Decatur despite the competition of 274 communities . At the other end was a new rayon plant . The foreman NOVEMBER 29 , 1954 who led us through the Wolverine factory was a local farm boy . The chemist who showed us around the rayon plant was another of Layman 's newspaper car riers ; the first to return to Decatur with a university de ? gree , and Layman 's special pride . " We spend $10,000 educating each young man , " he explained . " We 've lost 2,000 men each year from Lawrence County . When they start coming back instead of going North and West everything seems worthwhile . " " It 's like Old Man says there , " Layman said . Shelton 's pamphlet continued : These industries , land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minds of a defeated people , of a people who in the year before TVA saw an uncontrolled river flood and wash away the best soil , erode the back lands , wash crops , houses and barns down an angry stream . You can see by now that the opportunities which were at hand in the development of the river and the region were being seized upon by our people with renewed courage and confidence . We now knew that we could n't be licked again , that what had been preached to us by TVA was the economic truth . " So federal aid to the region has n't destroyed initia ? tive and freedom after all , " I said . ? " Read the next page , " Layman answered . The population of our town has grown from 12,000 to 24,000 and yet , the most significant change has been in the thinking of our people . We have come from the status of a well-nigh beaten citizenry , merely ex ? isting , to a hopeful , exuberant , smilingly confident people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded through making the fires of nature the servant of man .. . . we could rise to heights of good citizenship . . . ' How can you be certain , " I asked , " that all this would n't have happened without TVA ? " " Old Man 's got the answer to that , " said Layman . " Read the last sentence , and remember like I told you , that he and all the rest of us fought TVA at the first . " The last sentence read : . visitors come into our section of the Valley and ask : " Would n't this all have happened without a TVA ? " And my answer to one and all is " It did n't ! " TVA , I reflected , was n't the whole , story . For one factor , the obvious competence and high morale of pri ? vate enterprise had grown on me throughout the day as We toured through Decatur 's factories and mills . But the Tennessee Valley suffered from disabilities deeper than those which the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the war . And private enterprise alone could not have brought about the transformation of the Valley . Nor were the federal expenditures them ? selves of primary importance . TVA was the unifying KINTUCK force that brought together farmers , bankers , manufac ? turers and civic leaders , providing them with the means and objectives of co-operation and inducing in them a new attitude to their community and to themselves . Cer ? tainly they were stronger now , but without TVA the region could fail again to respond to enduring needs , the intricate pattern of prosperity here and throughout the valley could slowly break apart . We stood on Clancy 's dock in the twilight , where the barges were unloading on the Tennessee River . ? " It 's good , " said Layman , " to see the livestock coming down the river in barges instead of belly up . " Now , " he continued , " you see what TVA means to us . We 're not trying to force our pattern on anyone , - lie went on , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tem that we 've built belongs to all the people of the United States and we 're going to protect it , for them as well as for our children . And there 's another reason , said Layman . " Just read the cover of Old Man 's pamphlet and you 'll see . " The cover read : " An Address to the United Nations Scientific Conference on the Conservation and Utilization of Resources . " The United Nations wanted someone to tell the story of TVA to that world conference , " Layman explained . " They asked Gordon Clapp , the Chairman and Clapp * said no the story should be told by a citizen of the Val ? ley . So they chose Old Man . Course he 'd never have done it if they had n't gone ahead and announced he was coming . He 's too modest . " But what do you think Old Man 's father would have said about that ? " said Layman . He lived here all his life and Old Man 's lived here all his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world overseas did n't mean much to us 20 years ago . But now it does . Because every week or so some ? one comes through from India or Australia or Scotland , or some country we never heard of before . They tell us that when someone asks what 's good in America , where they came from , the answer is TVA . They 're setting up their own TVAs and they 're here studying us to_the take advantage of the mistakes we made and the lessons we 've learned . We were nothirig in 1934 , " said Layman . Now were one of the wonders of the world . "
