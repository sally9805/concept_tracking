To keep gamecocks and hunt the fox , To drink the punch and whisky , We fear no locks , we 'll train the cocks And care not if it 's risky . <P> - Old song <P> One morning last week at exactly 10:04 , 200 people enjoying their favorite sport in a California orange grove were interrupted by the sudden arrival of Captain Walker Hannon and 13 deputies from the Los Angeles sheriff 's office . The sportsmen fled wildly through the trees , but the sheriff 's men rounded up 23 men , two old women selling sandwiches , a small boy who had dropped by " to have some fun , " and 40 chickens , including Six-to-One Frank , Five-to-Three Vero and Even-Money Ason , three champion fighting cocks . <P> Next day the human culprits were haled into court and fined $25 apiece . Said Hannon : " It 's a mean kind of sport . " <P> In the Barrel . Cockfighting is illegal in every state of the Union . Nevertheless it is still an undercover sport in the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> For three years the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been fighting the cockfighters . S.P.C.A. officials estimate that a secret syndicate of 18 to 20 " big-wheel " promoters in California operate a cockfight business running to more than a million dollars annually . With the efficiency of an underground boxing commission , " the syndicate " coordinates matches in " mains " ( bigtime cockpits ) at Bakersfield , San Bernardino , Monterey , Visalia and El Centro , issues guides to lesser known pits in vineyards nearby . It also keeps tabs on championships , betting odds and bird prices , buys off the law when it can . <P> Betting at the fights , say the authorities , runs to seven figures a year and purses of $5,000 are common . At a raid in El Centre last year , S.P.C.A. men found one bookie stuffing the stake on a single ) bout into a 50-lb. nail keg and ramming the overflow down into the keg with his foot . <P> K.O. Is Curtains . The fighters command big-league prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as $50 . But once his training muffs ( chamois coverings to protect his spurs ) have been removed and replaced by lethally pointed steel " gaffs " and razor-edged " slashers " the price rises fast . There are few Joe Louises in the cocking main , where a k.o. means curtains for the loser , and birds who survive five or more fights can bring up to $15,000 . <P> Like horseplayers , cockfighters are apt to defend their sport on the ground that they are " improving the breed . " Their shoptalk is spiced with argument on the merits of reds , doms , warhorses , and other leading breeds . But the lure of the main time &; again is not that academic ; it is the vicarious thrill in a bloody contest that gives and asks no quarter .
