The sentence : $50,000 fine and 18 months ' imprisonment for evading $36,739 in federal income taxes . <P> For 1947-50 , according to the Government 's charges , Hallinan reported only 20% of his law income . Furthermore , he wrote off as business expenses a gymnasium and a swimming pool in his Telegraph Hill dacha . Other deductions included boxing and tumbling lessons for his six sons . <P> When Hallinan begins serving his term , he will not be in a totally unfamiliar environment . In 1952 he spent five months in jail on a contempt-of-court sentence incurred as defense counsel in the perjury trial of West Coast Longshoreman Harry Bridges .
