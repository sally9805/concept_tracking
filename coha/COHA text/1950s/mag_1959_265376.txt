The night of St. Jean 's Eve , June 23 , is the occasion in France of fireworks , bonfires and merrymaking . In bustling Perpignan , a city of 70,000 near the Spanish border , the holiday was celebrated as usual last year . But not everyone was amused . Jean Amiel , 37 , who taught English at the local lyce , rushed to quiet his five-year-old daughter when she awoke crying , after youngsters had slipped firecrackers through the letter slot in Amiel 's door and they exploded in the hall . He went to the open window , glimpsed five boys and two girls running laughing down the street . Said Amiel later : " I saw only silhouettes . I did n't recognize any of the children . Suddenly I got the idea of surprising them or frightening them with a shot . I fired haphazardly . I never intended , not for a moment , to kill anyone . " <P> But he did . The bullet from Amiel 's revolver struck one of his pupils , Alain Rolland , 16 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing trial in Perpignan 's sunlit Palais de Justice , Amiel was asked why he did not fire into the air . " It goes without saying , " he answered , " that I regret not having fired in the air .

He said sternly : " A teacher can never have sufficient provocation to kill a child . " <P> Courtroom Cry .

The jury apparently took into consideration Amiel 's wanly pretty wife , his small daughter , and the fact that his father had just died , grief-stricken at the collapse of Amiel 's future , and that his mother was near death . Amiel was sentenced to two years in prison . <P> From the crowded courtroom came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Remove that woman at once . " A lawyer answered : " It is the mother of Alain Rolland , " and no one moved . As Jean Amiel went back to his cell , where he had been reading Milton 's Paradise Lost , his wife was escorted out of town by police to protect her from the townspeople . But this was not the end of the affair . <P> The father of the dead student , Eugne Rolland , 52 , a bank official , could not be comforted by his wife or his remaining son , 14-year-old Michel . He considered the verdict an " affront , " complained that some of the witnesses had hinted that Alain got only what he deserved , railed against the " bandit " Amiel , whose life was supposedly dedicated to children and who had betrayed his trust .
