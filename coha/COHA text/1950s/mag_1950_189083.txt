One day last week , Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill sat down in a front pew in St. Paul 's Cathedral for special pre-campaign services conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury . The day 's lesson , from St. Luke 6 : 39 : " And He spake a parable unto them . Can the blind lead the blind ? Shall they not both fall into the ditch ? " <P> Next day , at Sandringham , King George VI signed a proclamation formally dissolving Britain 's Parliament . A few minutes later , the Lord Chancellor was speeding back to London to have the Great Seal affixed to the proclamation in the House of Lords , and by morning the mechanism of Britain 's complicated election machine had finally begun to function . The campaign was officially on . <P> Do n't , Do n't , Do n't . By U.S. standards , the campaign will not be a lively one . Speeches over the government-controlled British Broadcasting Corp . are limited to 14 for all the parties ; the full-page newspaper advertisements of most American campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws that would make most U.S. votegetters quit before they started are the ones governing campaign expenditures . Said one campaign manager last week : <P> " We 're putting up a list of ' don'ts ' in every committee room-and the list will cover a whole wall . " The list will include : " Do n't pay for bands , torches , flags or banners ; do n't provide refreshments for voluntary workers ; do n't pay for food , drink or entertainment for any voter ; do n't offer a gift ( including cigars ) , bribe or loan or promise same ; do n't exceed the number of cars legally permitted for carrying voters to the polls . " <P> Since the 1945 election there have been some changes in the British election setup . Two years ago Parliament abolished the so-called business premises vote . Previously , many businessmen had two votes , one in the constituency where they lived , another where they owned a place of business . In many constituencies the business premises votes ran to appreciable numbers ( e.g. , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of London constituency out of a total enrollment of 10,830 ) . <P> Parliament has also abolished the twelve university seats which were formerly filled by mail ballot votes of graduates of the leading universities. * <P> Felons , Lunatics &; Lords . The British electoral system does not provide for U.S.-style primaries . Instead , most prospective candidates are approved by both the central committee of the party under whose banner they wish to run and by the party association of the constituency concerned . The final decision is usually up to the local association , which chooses the candidate it thinks most likely to win . <P> Once he has been approved by the local party association , the candidate reports to the " returning officer " ( official election supervisor ) of the constituency in which he is to run . He is not , however , required to live in the constituency .
