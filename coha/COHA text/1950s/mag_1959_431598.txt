The gnawed bark of stunted trees and shrubs bears witness to their hunger . It has not rained for three months . But when the hot , dry summer ends , the heavy downpours will come , and the scorched , yellow land will be decked out in fresh green . Here , deep in the savanna , live the Kraho Indians we would visit . Their village , called Kenpokrekateye , has a peculiar shape . From the air it looks like a wagon wheel lying in the sand . The dwelling houses are connected by a broad boulevard , the rim , leading around from house to house . At the hub lies the village square . Straight paths leading to it from each house form the spokes of the wheel . Raccoonlike coati-mundis slung from t shoulders . a Kraho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians no poison on their arrows , relying on skill al to bring down game as far away as 40 yards .  | Just as a wheel is a closed structure . so is the village of the Kraho , and the village square is the true center of everything that happens . A strongly marked community life prevails in such a village , and an extraordinary sense of fairness is displayed toward every resident . About 120 Indians live here , but at midday the village seems dead . No one is to be seen , either in the village square or on the boulevard . Soon an old woman sticks her head from a door . Seeing us. she draws nearer . She is blind in one eye and has a goiter . " Is it thou , Vuvu ? " she asks . " Hast thou finally come back ? Thou hast been away so long and hast not forgotten us ? " The old woman embraces me and caresses me tenderly , then weeps loudly and plaintively ? so many have died during my absence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother , who adopted me eight years ago . " Look , Tui , little grandmother , I have brought my wife . Her name is Vilma . " Hunters Sleep Under the Stars The men are not at the village . For days they have been hunting on the savanna . Vilma remains with the women . and I go to find the men camping near a crystal-clear spring surrounded by a grove of buriti palms . The hunters have not built huts of leaves and branches , as they do when they bring women and children on long hunting trips in the summer . They sleep in the open on straw mats . Nearly every hunter has a fire under a barbecue frame of poles , on which the meat lies for smoking . At night it is stowed away in little hammocks made of two fan-shaped palm leaves tied together and hung between posts driven into the ground . In this way the meat is safe from the plundering , especially at night , of the ever-hungry Indian dogs . Mornings , the hunters go into the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prickly bamboo thickets . There is game here , far from the village : monkeys , tapirs , golden hares , sloths , porcupines , anteaters , and , on very lucky days , even a wild pig or deer . Almost all the hunters have muzzleloaders . A few still use bow and arrow .  | But the game is now too rare and shy for primitive weapons . Formerly the Kraho hunted with long clubs . Tribal myths tell of a hero who overtook deer on the run and slew them with such clubs . Even today the Kraho still hunt in a similar way . They drive deer over the savanna , from one small wood to another , until the animals grow weary and are easily killed . This type of hunting requires great speed and endurance on the part of the hunters . After a fatiguing hunt in the summer sun , the hunters return to camp in the afternoon . My friend Kratchet , in whose house I shall live , has shot a tapir . Others bring in anteaters and monkeys . Villagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire to burn off the fur ( page 343 ) . Only the deer and wild pigs are skinned , because their hides may be exchanged for powder and shot . The game belongs not to the one who killed it . but to all in common . Each hunter lays the animals killed by him on one of two great piles . Two young fellows are charged with the distribution . If a deer or wild pig has been killed , it is cut lengthwise and each half placed on a separate pile . An equal number of all other animals is also placed on each heap . Why is this done ? Well , that is very simple : the Kraho village is divided into two halves . One half comprises descendants of the sun , the other those of the moon . According to Kraho mythology , Sun , or Pud , and Moon , called Pudlere , were two men , friends and companions , and the first human beings on earth . All Kraho are descended from them . Each village half has a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half Haran. ateye . The Koigateye are also called the Stronger Ones , but that is merely symbolical . Indeed the sun was a strong and wise man , the moon stupid and sickly , but the two village halves are equally strong . When the two young men have cut up the meat and laid it out in piles , the further distribution to all begins . The ground is covered the fresh palm leaves . Two men , one from h village half , cut up the game into small pieces . A count is made of the number of persons to share in the meat , and a like number of small piles is laid out . Each hunter has the right to express his opinion about the division of the meat , whether one pile comes out too small or another too big . The divider heeds the criticism and corrects possible errors . Now the real distribution begins . First , the visitor receives his share , then the oldest Indians , then the grown men , and finally the youngest . Some of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The smoked meat is stowed in hampers woven by the men . Then we head back to the village in a long file , one after the other , according to the old Indian custom . We halt about a mile from the village . Here two young fellows go ahead . They have hewed two logs out of buriti palm and placed them on the ground beside each other . The hunters now approach these logs . Two men place them on their shoulders , then run at top speed across the savanna toward the village . The older men carrying the baskets of meat follow shortly . Yelling encouragement , all the boys and young men follow the log bearers in a wild dash ( next page ) . If one becomes fatigued , another immediately takes the heavy burden upon his shoulders . He endeavors , with redoubled energy and speed , to regain the time lost in changing the log . All the runners stake their honor on overtaking the others as many times as possible . @#  | In the village they run around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until the winning team throws down the log before the door of a house-in which a young maiden dwells . She is the team 's patroness . Many logs lie in front of her house . The race over , the perspiring runners go to bathe in a near-by brook . Relay log racing is the sport of the Kraho Indians ; without it , life would be unthinkable . It would be equivalent to the social and economic collapse of the tribe ; this sport , in competition between various groups , is a constant incentive to an animated social life . How the Log Racing Began " Javu , " I ask , " who introduced log races to you Kraho Indians ? " " Ah , Vuvu , that was a long time ago , " he replies . " Our first ancestors , the sun and the moon , did that when they were the only human beings on earth . Pud and Pudlere went hunting daily , and when they met on the savanna after the hunt , they left the game be-@# 346  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran a race with them to their homes . At that time there was no one but them . Hence , as they ran over the savanna they encouraged each other : Hey ! comrade , run ! ' That was silly , but there was no one else there who might call out to them . Then they went back to fetch their baskets . " That is the way they ran then , and that is how the Kraho do it even to this day . " Every day , after work in the fields , after a hunting trip , or on holidays , racing with the representing souls of the dead . Here two teams sprint for the finish line . Each will drop its log at the door of a patroness , a young girl . palm logs is organized . The weight of the logs ranges between 20 and 200 pounds . If the Koigateye take a notion to anger the Harangateye , or vice versa , they say mockingly : " Hey , you weaklings , you are not good enough to run with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'll see , all right ! " On the following day two especially heavy logs are hewed out . Frequently they have to be dragged along by two bearers . Then when the supple young runners whiz around the boulevard with their heavy logs , 347  | the girls peer through the straw of the houses . Mothers and aunts stand at the entrance . They rejoice over their young men and speak with pride of their athletic prowess . No one is the champion of log racing . Each youth is merely expected to be capable of athletic accomplishments . Indeed this goes so far that sickly youths who can not take part in the village 's athletic events are brushed aside by the others with biting scorn : " Look at that fellow ? he is a weakling ! " The smallest boys are not allowed to run with the others , though that is certainly their greatest desire . As soon as the older youths have finished running , the youngsters pick out small logs and away they go around and around the village . Youths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of age . When a man has passed 35 , he is eliminated . Then he must help carry the baskets of game from the hunt . The chief purpose of log racing is the physical training of the young Indian . Living on the broad savanna , the Kraho must journey far to hunt . Large game must often be rushed back to the village in a single day , to prevent spoilage . Log racing is also associated with Kraho religious beliefs . On certain occasions the Indians carry small hollow logs which weigh no more than 20 pounds and are said to represent the souls of the dead . Even Women Race with Logs At the beginning of the summer and winter log-racing cycles , two unusually large but hollow logs are laid side by side in the center of a square far out on the savanna . Two masters of ceremonies dance around them , singing songs and ritual formulas known only to them , as if charming spiritual forces into the logs . Then the men start running to the village with the logs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the same great distance , but they carry smaller logs . The women 's races take place only on special social or religious occasions . At the close of a race cycle , impressive ceremonies are performed . The honor girl of the teams is the principal personage on these occasions . In addition to sports , the Kraho like singing and dancing . It is dawn in the village square . The little fires , near which unmarried males are lying nearly naked on straw mats , have burned low . Shadowy figures move about . The horizon is just beginning to grow gray ( pages 340-41 ) . Now the beat of the dance rattle begins to resound and a melodious voice rings out . The sandy ground trembles with the stamping of feet . At first the beat is slow , dragging , and the voice soft and hesitating , gradually becoming faster and faster , until song and rhythm fill the growing morning . The voice is that of the village song leader and choir conductor . He dances with leaping step in the village square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best singer of the village . She is a young woman , famous because of her beautiful voice . She wears a wide red sash diagonally across the breast and back , a badge of honor . Soon the village 's second best singer , another woman , joins in . As soon as the song leader 's first notes are intoned , the two women must come , arising from warm beds or interrupting their housework , for their presence is an incentive to all  | women and girls to come to the singing on the village square . Soon the many-voiced five-toned chorus swells forth in the coming morning or the falling night . The young men ( lance with a hopping , running step back and forth in front of the women and girls in a long row facing east . The singing ends with the first rays of the sun . The women singers return to their houses . Then the whole population proceeds in groups to the bathing place . The Koigateye bathe downstream , the Harangateye higher up , and the women still farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair with clean sand and then splashing about in the cool , clear water . A gentle breeze blows over the savanna . Some boys have brought dry palm leaves taken from the roof of an abandoned house . Fires flare up briefly and die down . Naked groups stand around the flames with raised arms , warming themselves and drying their bodies . The day wears on with work in the fields . with hunting and log racing , with dancing and games in the village square , until evening comes . The song leader dances to his own singing in wild leaps to the rhythm of the gourd rattle . Soon the women and girls form a long row . They swing their arms and rock their knees in time to the music , and their beautiful singing fills the solitude of the spacious savanna night . Singing in the Wilderness The songs of the Kraho are beautiful even to our ears . Some resemble medieval religious songs in cadence and melody , others are like love songs . and still others have the quality of a marching song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; an outsider might not understand what is taking place . The conductor  | merely changes the beat of the rattle . The practiced singers recognize immediately from the rhythm what song is to follow . The song leader is both composer and poet . Generally the profession is handed down from father to son . When a choir conductor has composed a new song , he must introduce it to his singers . He takes a position in the middle of the village square , and the singers form a circle around him . He divides them into groups of four or five , places himself in front of one of the groups , shakes the rattle in the rhythm of the new song and sings the verses . He repeats once , and then they sing with him . He teaches the song in this way to group after group . The circle opens out again and all sing together . - Little wild dove ! Thy flight is so swift . " I'hy feet trip rustlingly on the savanna floor . Little wild dove , thou flyest like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sing of nature , of the fruits of the field , End of the wild life of the broad , hot savanna . The singing lasts until late . Married couples or older men in pairs sit in the soft - and , still warm from the summer day . They look on , converse , rest . As the night advances , families withdraw , one by one . Small children and grown girls are taken along . Only some young men , still dancing , remain in the village square . Soloist Serenades Village at Rest Small fires are lighted . Boys and young men spread out their sleeping mats , which reach down only to their knees ( page 349 ) . They lie down naked . Some whispering is still going on , and then something remarkable happens : The evening quiet is broken by loud coloratura singing . It is a male soloist . The melody is extraordinarily pleasing and his voice enchanting . The beauty of the song lingers in the memory of everyone who has heard it . It is one of the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest .. The Kraho are reputed to have been a warlike people . They have never been defeated in battle . Their fighting strength was broken only by the creeping in of epidemics . What fortified their warlike resistance in particular is their pronounced tribal consciousness and especially a kind of political tribal organization , not common among Brazilian In-IETY dians , which seems to combine all tribes of the same language group . Among them are included the Chavantes and Kayapo and the friendly neighbors of the Kraho , the Cherentes and the Apinaye. the Krikati , and the cousins of the Kraho , the Canella . In most Brazilian Indian tribes the witch doctor , or Paye , is the most important personage . His power usually exceeds that of the tribal chief . Not so with the Kraho . Here the village chief with his governing assistants has absolute authority . The witch doctor occupies a subordinate position , with no political power . Among the Kraho he is generally considered a social outsider , who uses his connection with the spirit world to prevent epidemics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the witch doctor is successful , he is a welcome guest . If he fails to cure , he may be accused by his envious colleagues of evil witchcraft , and he may be condemned by a secret council . An executioner specially chosen for the purpose will then lie in wait for him and slay him from behind . With the Kraho there are two governments of the village . One governs in winter , here the rainy season , and the other in summer . the dry season . Summer is the season of ceremonies and festive events . With the first heavy rains , the herald of the winter government appears at dusk on the village square . He leans on the ceremonial spear and proclaims to the people in a loud . singing voice that the time has come to submit to the government of the other half . The season of feasts and ceremonies has passed : now begins the season of work in the fields . The seasonal Pahi , or chief , does not make decisions arbitrarily . The will of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pahi 's main task , however , is to act as peacemaker in the village . A Kraho is born into one of the village halves and remains a member throughout his life . Boys are promoted , during the course of their lives , to the various age groups . Those from 5 to 15 years old are grouped together . The next group comprises youths from 15 to 25. though the range of years may be shifted . Then come the mature men , who take the principal part in the log racing . The very old constitute the council of elders , and the chief is chosen from among them . The younger age groups each have two in- structors , or leaders , carefully selected by the elders , who represent the two village halves . They initiate the boys in the tribal culture , with a program of instruction in accordance with their age . The various age groups sit in the village square in separate classes , the younger on the north and the older ones on the south . The elders sit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women have enough to do at home . When produce must be brought home from the fields , a few women and one man go out together . The man carries his weapons for protection ; the women carry the heavy baskets of tubers and fruits . A code of honor has arisen from this in the course of time . It used to be shameful for a man to carry a burden . But under present circumstances , he no longer plays the role of protector as formerly , when hostile attacks were still to be feared and wild animals might lie in wait for the women . Today a reasonable husband helps his wife bring home the heavy baskets of sweet potatoes , corn , or manioc roots . Among the Kraho , women do not play the leading part , as they do in some other tribes that live in the Brazilian forests . Indeed men were first on the wide , lonesome earth they lived alone , entirely without women . As legend has it : Pud and Pudlere felt lonesome in the world . So Pud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The log racing had terminated . The sun shone hot . Pud went down to bathe . He took a calabash with him and dipped into the water . He then went to house , leaving the calabash in the water . Kraho Eve Rises from a Brook It was not long before a peculiar clapping sound was heard coming from the water , and immediately thereafter a beautiful young woman came up out of the brook . When Pudlere saw her coming , he asked in astonishment : " Who art thou ? Where goest thou ? Come here to me : here is my house . " But the woman answered merely : " I am Pud 's woman ! " and continued past the house of the moon and straightway into the house of Pud . Pudlere was much impressed by the woman 's beauty . He would have liked to have a companion . But he was not as clever as the sun and did not understand magic . He could not create a woman !  | The following day Pud came to Pudlere to invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw mat in the dark of the hut and groaned : " Oh , I am so sick . I have such pains . " While saying this he held his hand over his left eye . " Let me see what is the matter with thee , " said Pud . Pudlere wailed even louder : " I can not go hunting with thee today . " When Pud went to him , Pudlere quickly spat into his hand and smeared his eye with saliva : " See , my eye is sick . It hurts so , oh , oh ! " " Yes , " said Pud , " thou must remain at home today . I shall go hunting alone . " When Pud had left , Pudlere cleaned his eye and went into Pud 's house . The young woman was crushing corn in a mortar . She was friendly with Pudlere . He said to her : " Come to me . Thou art so beautiful . Come . let 's be married . " For she was not yet exactly married to Pud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded with her so long , however , that she finally yielded and went into the house of Pudlere . When Pud returned from the hunt , his house was empty . He knew at once what had ho Indians 355 happened . He went over to the house of his friend and found them there truly married . But he was not angry , and simply said : " Good . thou likest Pudlere better than me : so thou must stay with him . I do not want thee any more ! " Pud Creates Another Woman Pud went bathing again . He dipped a calabash into the water . Again the strange clapping sound was heard , and soon a woman came out . She was even more beautiful than the first ! As she went past Pudlere 's house , he saw her and said : " Thou , come here , here is thy house ! " but she went into Pud 's house and became his wife . Soon there were children . The Kraho became numerous . They are all descended from Pud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a woman came from striking the water with cupped hands , just as the Kraho maidens do today for fun while bathing . Thus came life . There is also death . The summer will soon be over . Quiet reigns in the village during the hot midday hours . All the Indians are in the shade of their houses . Some are resting , lying on straw  | mats . Others are braiding little baskets , mats , and carrying bands . The women are scraping manioc roots , boiling , or baking . Then a loud wailing pierces the stillness . It is like a cut through the compact , heavy heat . All listen . Work is suspended . Someone whispers and springs to his feet : " Come , Vuvu , a boy has just died ! " He had been sick for a year and had never been quite healthy . It is the second child who has died in the family within a short time . Like his brother , he had suffered from attacks of epilepsy . Lately a severe case of anemia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen into the fire during an attack of epilepsy , and since then an arm and a leg were lamed . Now his suffering has ended . Requiem for an Indian Boy Relatives and friends come from all houses . They bend over the dead boy and lament loudly . The house of mourning is filled with weeping and sobs . But in this mourning there is order and rhythm , no chaos of unbridled grief . The weeping is suddenly interrupted by a speech addressed to the child by the mother in a chanting tone . The impression made as she speaks to her dead child is almost poetic . The words , in modulated voice , issue in measured sequence . It is unspeakably beautiful . And then she again breaks into weeping and lamentation ( opposite ) . The boy is lying on a straw mat on the floor of the hut . A feeble light strikes his almost white body . The mother and an aunt on the mother 's side wash the body and wipe it dry . They partly wrap the boy in cloths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with a yellowish-red stain called annatto . Only the children take no part in the general mourning . They are playing as usual , laughing and leaping happily . Two men come into the house , carrying a long pole . They then spread out a new mat , on which they lay the dead child . The body is rolled up in the mat , through which they stick the pole lengthwise . The bundle is tied up with woody fiber . Now they take the ends of the pole and lay them on their shoulders and carry the dead out . @# At this moment the house is filled with lamentations . Only a few follow the funeral procession . Some children go along out of curiosity , laughing and chattering unconcernedly . The dead boy had indeed been neither friend nor playmate . He lay lonesome in his hut as healthy life streamed by outside . The small cemetery is situated not far from the village , hidden in the savanna . There are few graves , recognizable by the mounds of earth thrown up . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not much more than three feet deep . The two pallbearers climb into the grave . Others assist them to lower the body , carefully , tenderly . Strong , straight branches are laid lengthwise over the grave and firmly anchored at both ends . They are to prevent digging animals from gnawing at the corpse . While we are in the cemetery , all those in the house of mourning undergo a ritual ablution . Great calabashes full of cool , clean water are poured over their bodies , and they wash themselves with great care . Now heavy rains are falling ever more frequently . The temperature during the day is becoming more pleasant . The morning usually begins with radiant sunshine . The sky becomes cloudy toward noon , and at any time in the afternoon the heavens fall and everything is flooded . The sand quickly soaks up much water , while the remainder runs off in the near-by brook , which rises rapidly . Soon there is beautiful sunny weather again . Fish a Rare Treat for Inland Indians There were no fish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ascending the stream . The Kraho kill them with poisonous herbs which they have planted in the vicinity of their homes . Eating fish is a rare pleasure for inland inhabitants . While I was bathing with the Indians , they had some news for us . " Vuvu , " called Kratchet , splashing in the clear water , " a long time ago our neighboring village made you their Pahi . Now there is talk on the village square that our village also wishes to have you , and that Vilma should become Sartom ! " @#  | " What is Sartom ? " Vilma asks him later . " That is the same as Pahi , only it is a woman , " Kratchet tells her . " Pahi is the man who takes care to see that there are no quarrels among us . When two persons in the village begin quarreling , he goes to them and sets things right again . He is our chief . It has always been so with us . " The following morning shortly before sunrise . someone shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Almost the whole population has assembled in front of our house . We go down to the brook . The water is deep and cold . You . Vuvu , must undress yourself completely . " They lead me by the hand into the water . Four young men come to me and pour and splash water over me . I must wash myself . Vilma is bathed at another place by the women and girls ( page 359 ) . " Now come out and wait here , Vuvu . " Villagers Initiate Author and Wife I shiver with cold . Slowly the sun warms the morning air . Vilma comes also . All the others are still bathing . A group of men approaches us . They lift us and put us on their shoulders , then go with us up the slope to the village . The crowd follows us , shouting loudly and shooting their muzzle-loaders , charged only with powder . We are trotted to the village square and then set down on straw mats . Women come with leaf bags . From them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over our bodies . Trunk , back , shoulders , arms , and legs are entirely covered . Only the face , neck , hands , and feet are left free . In response to a nod , other men and women bring little baskets filled with down . They begin feathering our bodies by dabbing the down into the liquid rubber . " You are big as a prykok ! " says one of the women . Everybody laughs . " Prykok " means ox . She means to say by this that there will hardly be enough feathers to cover my whole body . Again girls come with small leaf packages . Palm oil is poured from the calabashes into their hands . They rub annatto balls in their palms . The color mixes with the oil . Then they paint our necks , arms , and hands with their red-smeared hands . We get red dabs and stripes on the face . The whole population of Kenpokrekateye is gathered on the village square , men and women , old people and children . All have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great holiday . Two men lift us to the shoulders of others . My bearer groans under the burden , and the triumphal procession begins on the boulevard around the village . The people follow us with yells , cries of delight , and joyful shots from their muzzle-loaders ( page 358 ) . If one of the bearers gets tired , another takes over . With the cooperation of several . we are lifted from one pair of shoulders to another without touching the ground . But now I am aware of something different . This time the gait is more elastic . I perceive that I am being carried by a woman . and this makes it all the wilder . She runs playfully out ahead with me on her shoulders . turns quickly around and passes through the Indians following , who now break out into loud cries of enthusiasm and fire their guns . The distance around the village is about 650 yards . We complete one lap . Then they set us down on the straw mats again . A pause . Robkucho , the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elders of the village . who still knows well the ritual and songs . When he dies , many an old tradition will vanish forever from the life of the Kraho . Neophytes Receive Many Names Men and women form a double row . We stand at the end , between them , with Robkucho in the center . He looks at them all for a long time , then begins to walk with rapid stride back and forth along the rows . He approaches us , then again withdraws . While doing this he delivers a speech , the sense of which is somewhat as follows : " The Kraho nation , and in particular our village , Kenpokrekateye , has decided to receive our two friends , Vuvu and Vilma. as members of the tribe . Henceforth you shall have the following names . " He enumerated about ten names for each of us , of which only the first names remain in our memory . Vilma is called Tshiki and I , Tshotere .

And when this ritual has ended . you can try out the power of your office .

You know that we Kraho are a peaceful and industrious people . We cultivate our fields and hunt on the savanna . But never do we harm anyone . We are honest people and not thieves . " Our region has grown poor , and our children often cry for a small piece of meat to eat with their sweet potatoes or manioc cakes . But our men return from their hunt with empty hands . " Formerly , when we went out from our village , the savanna floor was furrowed with the tracks of many wild animals . There were many stags and roes , wild pigs . anteaters , foxes , armadillos. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men came . They brought horses , dogs , and firearms and drove off or killed our food . Instead of game tracks , we saw only the great hoofprints of their cattle in the sand . " We have always respected the property of our neighbors , even when our children hungered . " Yet our neighbors have accused us unjustly of hav-@#  | ing stolen their cattle , when their cattle wandered away into the savanna or had been killed by poisonous snakes . And one day our village was attacked by an armed band while we men were hunting . Women and children died under their bullets . " For this reason we have made you our Pahi ! You must never forget us when you are again living in the great city . " And should you one day hear that we are going to be attacked again , come to us in time to warn us . When you come to us again , you shall always be received as friends with the honors of your office . All the Kraho will lend obedience to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were again told to wait . Then many came from their houses with presents . They laid them in silence before us : feather adornments , ceremonial spears , little straw baskets with covers in beautiful braided work , sleeping mats , and , finally , a bright-green tame parrot . " All these are presents for the new Pahi and the Sartom , " said one , and added that no gifts in return were necessary , as otherwise is customary when someone gives a present . " But you should give a small remembrance to all those who carried you and decorated your bodies . " Five-day Walk to Wave Farewell Summer is at an end . We must go back through the savanna before the watercourses are filled and difficult to cross . When we head back toward civilization , many of our friends accompany us for hours ; some even walk the whole five days under the burning sun and pouring rain to the next locality , in order to wave to us as the airplane takes us from their sight . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresponsible elements because of their fertile grazing grounds . The late Marshal Candido Rondon , who dedicated himself to the protection of Brazilian Indians , sent officers of the army into the area and had the guilty persons arrested . They were kept in prison for many years . A reservation was created for the Kraho Indians and a protection post established . Since then they have had peace and safety  | from attacks . But they have never forgotten the unjust attack . Their homeland , the savanna , was formerly a region rich in game . The stock has declined so greatly , because of ruthless hunting by cattle raisers who have invaded their country , that any adequate supply of meat through hunting is no longer possible . It is necessary quickly to find a change of course for the Kraho . The natural evolution would be from hunters to cattle raisers . That is also their fondest wish . And that they are already suited to become cattle breeders is shown by their treatment of the few animals which some of them already own . Under no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow , even if the children beg ever so hard for a piece of meat . Their purpose is to increase the stock of cattle in order , in the distant future , to have their own herds like their civilized neighbors . Four Hundred Kraho Survive But the road leading to that point is long . It endangers the very existence of the Kraho . Serious indications of malnutrition are already noticeable among them . We discussed these problems during our long evening conversations on the village square . The Kraho were enthusiastic about the following suggested solution : " In accordance with your tribal customs , a herd of cattle should belong to the village community and not to separate individuals . For by introducing the concept of personal ownership , the life of the Kraho as a community could be easily disturbed . Your culture is too strongly rooted in community work and observances . " Today there are still about 400 Kraho Indians living in three villages . To give them a good start , it would be necessary to provide them with about 1,000 head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a few years the Kraho Indians would be in a position to care for their cattle and increase them by themselves ; then the " wild Indians " would become useful cattle raisers , who would contribute to the economic development of the whole of Brazil without sacrificing their own ancient culture . @#
