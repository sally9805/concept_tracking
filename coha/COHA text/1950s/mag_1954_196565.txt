President Eisenhower 's recommendations on labor law , which went to Congress this week , were cut out of the same cloth as his State of the Union message . He recognized that the Wagner Act , passed " by bipartisan majorities " in 1935 , was necessary to protect the workingman . He noted that the Taft-Hartley Act , passed " by bipartisan majorities " *i n 1947 , was necessary to cope with the new power of unions . Taft-Hartley is sound legislation , Eisenhower said , but experience gained under it " indicates that changes can be made to reinforce its basic objectives . " <P> The President 's proposed amendments are a compromise between what labor and management want . They lean to labor 's side , but not nearly enough to satisfy labor leaders . Among the recommendations : <P> Secondary boycotts ( using economic pressure against one employer to win a dispute with another ) are " indefensible . " But the law 's sweeping ban on secondary boycotts should be amended to permit union action against 1 ) an employer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) any employer on a construction site where another employer with a contract on the same site is struck . Also , the National Labor Relations Board should merely be permitted , not required , to seek an injunction in secondary-boycott cases . The law 's provisions against union busting should be strengthened . Neither union nor management should be permitted to open a contract for new negotiations during a contract 's term unless the contract specifies that it can be reopened or unless both parties consent . In cases of strikes which create a national emergency , the President should be able to require that his fact-finding board make specific recommendations for settling the dispute . <P> In the construction , amusement and maritime industries , where employment is usually casual , temporary or intermittent , the law 's ban on the closed shop should be relaxed . Employers and unions in these industries should be permitted to enter into agreements under which the union will be treated as the employees ' representative , even before any employees are hired . <P> A union should not be held responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his membership in the union . , CJ The provision which requires union officials to sign non-Communist affidavits should be extended to employers . Congress should make clear that the right of free speech , as defined in the law , applies equally to labor and management . There should be a Government-supervised secret vote of the union members on whether they want to strike . <P> <P> CJ An employee s authorization for a check-off of dues should be valid for the full life of the union-management contract , rather than for only one year . <P> In addition , the President looked forward to amendments on two other phases of the law : 1 ) he asked Congress to study methods of providing greater safeguards for the money paid into union welfare funds , and 2 ) he said the Administration is studying means of drawing a clear line between state and federal jurisdiction in labor disputes . <P> <P> For the Wagner Act : in the Senate , 49 Democrats , twelve Republicans ; in the House , an overwhelming voice vote . For Taft-Hartley : in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , 215 Republicans , 93 Democrats .
