txt Secretary of State Dulles said today that the United States would help India overcome her economic difficulties . Mr. Dulles said he could not at this time " go into any detail " on the dollar amount of the that would be extended from United States sources . He added , however , that the United States favored giving support to India 's second fiveyear plan of industrial development , which has run into heavy weather because of a deterioration of India 's balance-of-payments position . Mr. Dulles said that through loans from the Development Loan Fund , the Export-Import Bank , perhaps the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and from other sources , " wt hope we can give that plan eonugh foreign aid so it will be possible for it to continue in adequate form , although not the full form the Indians originally projected and would like to have . " Other Plans Are Listed In the course of his news conference Mr. Dulles made these other points on the Administration 's intentions in the foreign aid CThe Administration intends no special response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It believes that the Development Loan Fund , which is just getting under way , has sufficient money and flexibility to meet any contingency . CiThe planned aid program in the Middle East will be about the same in the next fiscal year as in this . Because of the drop in commcidity prices in Latin America , the Soviet Union will " try to do some fishing there , " but the Administration is convinced that its attempt to exploit the situation will meet with little success . Negotiations on aid to India have been going on since the Indian Finance Minister , T. T. Krishnamachari , visited Washington last fall for the meeting of the International Bank for ( Reconstruction and Development . India 's second five-year development plan , which began in the spring of 1956 , has run into I difficulties for a number of reasons , but largely because of rising cost of imports and unexpected volume of private imports . Last summer India imposed import controls and credit restrictions . These controls have begun to slow the drain on her reserves of foreign currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,400,000,000 in loans from Western sources will be needed over the next three years if India is to meet the basic goals of the program . Extent of U. S. Assistance Indian sources report that ' there is a prospect of India 's ( getting a first-year loan of $250 000 000 to $300,000,000 . This would be supplied partly by the Development Loan Fund and partly by the Export-Import Bank . In addition , negotiations are going forward for a purchase of wheat under Public Law 480 , 1which permits the United States to lend back most of the payment in local currency . Negotiations are proceeding also with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for loans totaling more than $100,000,000 for the development of the ports of Calcutta and Bombay and two electric power projects . Finally , India hopes that West Germany will agree to a deferring of payments on the $160,000,000 steel plant it built in India . Mr. Dulles said the planned aid to India would probably require Congressional appropriations . He was apparently alluding to the second-year appropriations for the Development Loan Fund and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration asked for $2,000,000,000 for the Development Loan Fund ? an initial appropriation of $500 , - 1000,000 and authorization for the second and third years of $750,000,000 each year . Congress finally appropriated $300,000,000 for the first year and authorized a second appropriation of $625 , - 000,000 . The Administration has1 decided to ask no more than the $625,000,000 authorized . As to the Export-Import Bank , its reserves are now under $500,000,000 . President Eisenhower has announced , however , that he will ask Congress for $2,000,000,000 in new lending authority . Mr. Dulles said today that he had decided to attend the Baghdad Pact conference in Ankara this month because of the fact that " we are taking a more lively interest in the activities of the pact . " The pact , which joins Britain , Turkey , Iran , Iraq and Pakistan , is a link between NATO and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization . Although the United States is not a member of the Baghdad Pact , it is represented on three of the pact 's committees . Mr. Dulles pointed out that last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized aid not only to Middle Eastern countries seeking to defend themselves against communism , but also to " groups of nations " ? that is , the Baghdad sPaet . As a result of the Middle East resolution , former Representative James P. Richards of South Carolina made a fifteen-nation tour last spring with authority to commit $200,000,000 in already appropriated funds for military and economic aid . Ambassador Richards cornmitted $118,700,000 of the $200. - 000,000 , of which $67,700,000 was for economic aid . The . Baghdad Pact got $12,500,000. for military telecommunications ? and roads . Today Mr. Dulles said that aid to Middle Eastern countries would be " along the general lines " laid out by Mr. Richards , and roughly of the same " order of magnitude . "
