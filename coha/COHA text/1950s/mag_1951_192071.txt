Mrs. Howard Tucker , 45 , had not felt so well in years . Member of a family in which mother , sister and an uncle had died from polycystic kidneys , * she herself was the first patient to receive healthy kidney transplanted from the body of another woman who had just died ( TIME , July 3 ) . Nearing the anniversary of her landmark operation , Rut Tucker had gained 20 Ibs. , was doing her own housework , even to washing &; ironing , and going out evenings , full of pe . Then the blow fell . <P> Kidney specialists , gathered in Chicago fortnight ago for the American Urological Association 's annual meeting , were impatient to hear about the transplant progress . They could not hear from Surgeon Richard H. Lawler , who performs the operation , because he was in Europe and anyway they wanted the views of one of their own members . Dr. Patrick H. McNulty had been consulting urologist on the case , and he was persuaded to report <P> Hazelnut Size . Said McNulty : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning and never had . It had shrunk , he said , to the size of a hazelnut . The reason , Dr. McNulty said , was that the donor 's tissues were incompatible with Mrs. Tucker 's . His statements were given to reporters , and one of them phoned Mrs. Tucker . <P> Says Mrs. Tucker : " If I had a weak heart , this shocking news would have killed me . What a way to get your death sentence-from a newspaper reporter ! But Mrs. Tucker refused to take the word as a death sentence . " The doctors have always told me everything because they know I can take bad news , " she said . " Why would they build me up to this letdown ? " <P> More Mad Than Anything . The last time Surgeon Lawler checked on the transplanted kidney was April 1 , when he performed a follow-up operation to widen the ureter where it was being narrowed by scar tissue . He told Mrs. Tucker then that he was well satisfied with it , hoped that it would work so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseased , could be removed later . Back from Europe , where he heard about three human kidney transplants , made since his operation , Surgeon Lawler was keeping his mouth shut last week . He was expecting to publish his own report in the A.M.A. Journal . <P> But Mrs. Tucker felt perfectly free to talk . The grafted kidney was placed where she can feel it , she said . " It 's still there , it has n't floated , and if it 's only the size of a hazelnut , it 's the biggest hazelnut that ever grew . " Added Mrs. Tucker : " While I do have butterflies in my stomach about it , I 'm more mad than anything . " <P> *An incurable disease in which cysts destroy the working tissues of the kidneys.
