" You realize , " said the detective weightily , " that you were seen at almost every moment ?

" Your father tells me , " he said , holding the match , " that you 're quite the little writer . " As though he might have been saying , " a girl scout patrol leader , " or , " top in your grade in algebra , " and obviously meaning to make her sound less like her mother and more like a frightened girl not yet in college .

Perhaps someday , Natalie thought quickly , chiding herself , I 'll learn to talk for a longer time and not stop to think about it in the middle. "  --  novel ? " the man said . This was hopeless ; they were too far into their conversationfor Natalie to say anything at all without losing all the ground she had gained ; she would betray herself utterly if she asked him what he had said ; she could hardly pretend she did n't care , or walk off , or turn her back ; she could certainly not go back now and ask him if he were having ap51nice time .

She smiled . Now I can get up and walk away , she thought , the faster the better . She started to get up , but the man got up first , and took hold of her arm . " About how wonderful she is , " he said as though to himself . " Thinking about how wonderful she is .

Five for the symbols at your door , Four for the gospel-makers , people shouted at them as they moved . " Come along , " the man told Natalie . " This I intend to hear more about .

" " One is one and all alone and evermore will be so " " You will not escape this , " the detective said . He dropped his voice and said , so quietly that she barely heard him , " This you will not escape . " The strange man led Natalie away from the crowd on the lawn and across the grass ; after a minute the people and their voices ( " Six are the six proud walkers .. . " ) were removed into a background noise , distantly behind them in the night-filled garden . They moved slowly ; Natalie was afraid to speak , not trusting her voice in the new silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when she spoke it would be in a scream . In those few quick minutes the man walking next to her had changed so rapidly from one shadow , on the lighted lawn , to another shadow , in the dark garden , and her final statement to him had been so conclusive , that past " Are you having a good time ? "  --  which now seemed even less appropriate than before  --  there was nothing to say . He spoke , at last . Without the support of other noise , his voice was weak , and perhaps even older than it had sounded before . " Now then , " he said . " Tell me what she thinks is so wonderfulabout herself . " How far wrong , Natalie thought , can one person be about another ? Perhaps in that little time I have grown in his mind and he is now talking to some Natalie he thought he had hold of by the arm . She felt the grass under her feet , the soft brush of bushes against her hair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the time had slipped away from under Natalie and while she had been behaving in her mind , under the lights , as though it were five o'clock , she found now in the darkness that it was much , much later , long past dinnertime , long past any daylight . She found that she was carefully carrying a glass in her hand , and she brought it up and sipped at it , standingstill to do so . " Tell me , " he said insistently . " I ca n't answer that , " Natalie said . " Do you realize , " he said , amused , " that you made a perfectlyoutrageous statement ? You ca n't refuse an explana-tion . " I wonder what I said , Natalie thought ; she tried to rememberand found that just as her feet were wandering over the grass , so her mind was wandering over the hundreds of words she had heard and spoken that day ; it was not possible , she thought , annoyed , to sort out any one statement from that confusion and answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we ? " she asked . " Near some trees , " he said . They had come , then , to the trees where Natalie had once encountered knights in armor ; she could see them ahead , growing together silently . There were almost enough of them to be called a forest . Natalie could still , before reaching the trees , see the path under her feet ; the darkness was then not yet absolute , but the light came by some unknownmeans , since there was no moon and the lights from the house could not reach this far ; Natalie thought briefly that the light came from her own feet . " I used to play in here when I was a child , " she said.  |p54Then  they were into the little forest , and the trees were really dark and silent , and Natalie thought quickly , The danger is here , in here , just as they stepped inside and were lost in the darkness . What have I done ? she wondered , walking silently among the trees , aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , and their great unbent heads , and the darkness they pulled about her with silent patient hands . the darkness they pulled about her with silent patient hands . When the man beside her spoke she was relieved : there was another human being , then , caught in this silence and wandering among the watchful trees , another mortal . " Let 's sit down here , " he said , and without speaking Nataliesat beside him on a fallen trunk . Looking up , as she did immediately , she saw immeasurable space , traveling past the locked hands of the trees , past the large nodding implacable heads , up and into the silence of the sky , where the stars remained , indifferent . " Tell me what you thought was so wonderful about yourself , " the man said ; his voice was muted . Oh my dear God sweet Christ , Natalie thought , so sickenedshe nearly said it aloud , is he going to touch me ? Natalie awoke the next morning to bright sun and clear air , to the gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the light on the floor ; she lay quietly , appreciating the morning in the clear uncomplicated momentvouchsafed occasionally before consciousness returned . Then , with the darkening of the sunlight , the sudden coldnessof the day , she was awake and , before perceivingp55clearly why , she buried her head in the pillow and said , half-aloud , " No , please no . " " I will not think about it , it does n't matter , " she told herself , and her mind repeated idiotically , It does n't matter , it does n't matter , it does n't matter , it does n't matter , until , desperately , she said aloud , " I do n't remember , nothing happened , nothing that I remember happened . " Slowly she knew she was sick ; her head ached , she was dizzy , she loathed her hands as they came toward her face to cover her eyes . " Nothing happened , " she chanted , " nothing happened , nothing happened , nothing happened , nothing happened . " " Nothing happened , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost day . " I do n't remember . " " I will not think about it , " she said to her clothes , lying on the chair , and she remembered as she saw them how she had torn them off wildly when she went to bed , thinking , I 'll fix them in the morning , and a button had fallen from her dress and she had watched it roll under the bed , and thought , I 'll get it in the morning , and I 'll face it all in the morning , and , In the morning it will be gone . If she got out of bed it would be true ; if she stayed in bed she might just possibly be really sick , perhaps delirious . Perhaps dead . " I will not think about it , " she said , and her mind went on endlessly , Will not think about it , will not think about it , will not think about it . Someday , she thought , it will be gone . Someday I 'll be sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will perhaps recall that something of this sort happened once ( where ? when ? who ? ) and will perhaps smile nostalgically thinking , What a sad silly girl I was , to be sure.  |p56How  I worried , she would think  --  would it have happenedagain by then ? " I wo n't think about it , " she said . " Wo n't think about it , wo n't think about it . " Get up , she thought , so that someday , as quickly as possible , with infinite speed , somehow , she might get to be sixty-nine , eighty-four , forgetting , smiling sadly , thinking , What a girl I was , what a girl .. . I remember one time ; did it happen to me or did I read it somewhere ? Could it have happened like that ? Or is it something one only finds in books ? I have forgotten , she would say , an old lady of ninety , turning over her memories , which would be  --  please God  --  faded , and mellowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , sitting on the edge of her bed , " oh , please , please . " The most horrible moment of that morning , and of that day  --  horrible in itself by being , horrible with its sidelong ( suspicious ? knowing ? perceiving ? ) looks from her mother and father , heavy amusement from her brother , horrible with remembered words and impossible remembered acts , horrible with its sunlight and its cold disgusting hours  --  the most horrible moment of that morning or any morning in her life , was when she first looked at herself in the mirror , at her bruised face and her pitiful , erring body . She came down to breakfast dressed unfamiliarly in her old clothes ; so much of her life had taken place in the blue dress she wore the day before that her old sweater and skirt seemed strange , the costume for some extraordinary Natalie part , which had lain for weeks in a stockroom , waiting for the chosen actress to put them on . Perhaps a gladiator , entering the arena , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raked and still showing little hills and scuff marks which registered thep57brief passage of previous victims ; Natalie , approaching her own breakfast table , observed absently that her napkin , folded by herself at breakfast the day before , was pulled carelessly through the ring . Her mother 's face , Natalie saw , was tired and she looked at none of them ; her father was red-eyed and frowning . All of us , Natalie thought , and turned her eyes to the table . " Good morning , everyone , " she said without cheer . " Morning , " said her mother wearily . " Natalie , " said her father without enthusiasm . " Hi , " said her brother ; his voice was outrageously fresh , and Natalie thought briefly , No one ever knows what he 's been doing . We are a graceless family , she thought again , cringing away from her own worn mind . " No egg , thank you , " she said civilly to her mother , avoiding in time a look at the plate of fried eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who passed her the toast without displaying any conspicuousinterest in whether or not she starved . Her family 's dullness lessened Natalie 's own concern , and she began to lose a little of the feeling that her face showed , as the map of a country passed through by only one travelerand charted with a single destructive route , any of the fears of this morning , although when she relaxed even slightly the " Please , please , please , " still echoed maddeninglythrough her head . " What would she do if she knew what I know ? " Natalie asked herself , staring at her mother from under her lashes ; " What would she know if she did what I did ? " And from far within her head came the echo , " please , please , please . " Mrs. Waite , who had hoped for so long to persuade Nataliep58of her womanhood with words , having no better weapon at her disposal , sighed deeply , and the silence at the breakfast table , which had been a family silence before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to speak ? Natalie wondered ; not me , certainly . She knew , incredibly , that if she spoke she would tell them what had happened ; not because she so much desired to tell , that she wanted to tell even them , but because this was not a personal manifestation , but had changed them all in changing the world , in the sense that they only existed in Natalie 's imagination anyway , so that the revolution in the world had altered their faces and made their hearts smaller . I wish I were dead , Natalie thought concretely . Mr. Waite leaned back , so that the feeble sunlight , which had endured for a very long time , touched his hair impersonally . " Your God , " he remarked bitterly to his wife , " has seen fit to give us a black and rotten day . "  |p59ANYTHING  which begins new and fresh will finallybecome old and silly . The educational institution is certainly no exception to this , although training the young is by implication an art for old people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , the mere process of learning is so excruciating and so bewildering that no conceivable phraseology or combination of philosophies can make it practical as a method of marking time during what might be called the formative years . The college to which Arnold Waite , after much discussion , had decided to send his only daughter was one of those intensely distressingorganizations which had been formed on precisely the same lofty and advanced principles as hoarier seats of learning , but which applied them with slight differences in detail ; education , the youthful founders of the college had told the world blandly , was more a matter of attitude than of learning . Learning , they had remarked in addition , was strictly a process of accustoming oneself to live maturely in a world of adults . Adults , they pointed out with professorial cynicism , were tough things to come upon suddenly . As a result ,  |p60they  concluded  --  and this may be found still in their catalogues , although much of the original thesis has been modifiedand watered down by their trustees  --  going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a drastic experience . Obviously , in any college which begins with the notion of education as experience , a certain amount of confusion must be allowed for before anything can be done about what is going to be taught . Should the student be free , for instance ? Should the teacher be free ? Or should the concept of freedom be abandoned as an educational ideal and the concept of utility be substituted ? Ought the students be allowedsentimental sciences like Greek ? Or geometry ? Should there be a marriage course ? What , precisely , should be the attitude taken by the college with regard to a residentpsychoanalyst ? The college had been in existence for perhaps fifteen years . Its founders had thought they were cutting their problemsin half , originally , by eliminating men from the studentbody and women from the faculty . They had told one another honestly over beer in the clever apartments where the idea of the college had first seen light that they all of them believed in informality , that more information was derived from one casual conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all a thing of give and take and should be a pleasure as well as a duty . Words like " mature " and " sustained " and " life " and " realistic " and " vision " and " humanities " were used lavishly . It was decided to construct the college buildings entirely of shingle and " the original beams " ; it was supposed that modern dance and thep61free use of slang in the classrooms might constitute an aura of rich general culture . It was decided that anyone who wanted to study anything should be accommodated , althoughgym was not encouraged , and it was regarded as extremelyfortunate that no one spoke up for microbiology before the fifth year of the college 's life . It was ardently hoped that moderately odd students  --  such as perhaps even Negroes , or real Navajo Indians  --  might desire to enroll . It was unanimously voted that students should be allowed to drink , stay out all night , gamble , and paint from nude female models , without any kind of restraint ; this , it was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student was to be allowed to make any suggestion . The faculty members were to be drawn almost entirely from a group which would find the inadequate salary larger than anything they had ever earned ; the first legitimately appointed Literature professor was a young man whose series of articles in a political journalhad aroused much comment , since they were concerned with the illiberal overtones of a revival of Aristophanes . The music faculty were , to a man , intensely interested in the various usefulnesses of the percussion instruments , and without exception composed drum quartets to accompany the college dancers . A great deal was said about old Englishballads , and one entire course with a large enrollment spent a semester studying " Frankie and Johnny . " It was not believed among the science people that information came before experiment , except in the most extreme cases ; " Theory is nothing , experience all , " was a phrase used most effectively in the college prospectus . The people in the town near the college felt strongly that the college commu/pity was Communistic , and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many rich people sent their daughtersthere . Unfortunately , this state of mind , happy as it might be for the future adults of the world , did not in the last analysisprofit the college . It was found that certain compromiseswith conservatism were desirable . Although the collegecatalogue continued to lean heavily on " expression " and " creative activity , " the practice of both became more restrained , and some required courses were found necessary . Instead , for instance , of being allowed to dance as they pleased , students were now required to dance in patterns . Students who formerly waited on table for the joy of commoneffort were now paid small wages for their work . Insteadof being allowed to gamble and drink freely , they were permitted to do neither on campus without the condoningpresence of a faculty member or wife , the young man who resented Aristophanes having been dismissed after two years . The students indeed might stay out all night if their rigid schedules permitted , but only if an accurate addresswere left with the college officials . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident in each living center ; this person was called a " tenant , " inhabiteda faculty apartment , and was expected to exert a semi-official influence over the girls in the house and to invitethem in to tea occasionally . These faculty apartments were much sought after , because they were inexpensive compared with what the students in the houses paid for their rooms , and because they were a more comfortable place for single faculty than the living centers devoted to faculty or the unusually perishable faculty houses.  |p63Thus  the college was , in brief , a place modern , authentic , progressive , realistic , honest , and humane , with decent concessionsto the fact that it was supposed to be , and had to be , a strictly budget-balanced proposition , a factory in which the intake must necessarily match the outgo . It had a cleanshavenpresident who played golf and who made speeches to Women 's Clubs in a mildly humorous vein , a board of trustees who came regularly to sherry parties and tours of inspection , a faculty with more-or-less accurate caps and gowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranging from the bold-eyed members of the first graduatingclass , who were almost without exception divorced and haggard women of the world , to the well-trained members of the most recent graduating classes , who came back comfortablyto reunions with their small children . It might also be noted that the " original beams " having been found to need constant repair , plastic brick had been substituted wherever possible . It was , for Natalie , precisely a new start . The room was almost square , perhaps a little longer than it was wide , with only one window that filled almost the entire far wall . So far , completely blank and empty , it was expectant , almostcurious , and Natalie , standing timidly just inside the door , in the walls opposite the window , looked at the bare walls and floor with joy ; it was , precisely , a new start . The walls and ceiling had been painted a dull tan , in the proper institutional bad taste , so uninspired as to be almost colorless , and the dark-brown woodwork and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The uncur/tained window showed the rain clouds ; because the room was on the third floor it was lighter than many , but still Natalie had to turn on the light , a bare bulb in the ceiling which lighted with a string , in order to admire most fully the clear spatial beauties of her room . These were walls to be adorned with her pictures , or whatever else she chose to put on them ( a fine of twenty-five cents for every nail hole , of course ; graduation from the college not allowed untilevery blemish on the walls of the room , including marks left by scotch tape , had been paid for ) , the floor was readiedfor the movements of her feet , presenting itself as exactlyright-angled at the corners and in respectful anticipation of anything Natalie might be inclined to set upon it ( excepting , of course , scratches , which must be eradicated at the comptroller 's office by the payment of a small fine ) and the ceiling , bleak and neat in the unshaded light from the bulb , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of package , compact and square and air- and water-proof , a precise , unadulterated , fresh start for Natalie , a new clean box to live in . They  --  the unidentified , fearsome , unsleeping they of the institution  --  had furnished it , of course . They , along with their nightmare watchfulness , and their frantic concern over marring , possessed an unerring sense of the minimum in form and design , in material and workmanship , in color and quality , which a girl , paying her tuition and her room and board as expected , could endure in silence . The bed was narrow and its mattress thin enough for the sleep of exhaustion , never thick enough for the restless pre-exam sleep of worry . The sheets and pillowcases were piled neatly on the foot of the bed . Natalie had her own blankets in her trunk ;  |p65her  mother had chosen dark rose as most practical , and had indulged Natalie in a bright bedspread and matching curtainsfor this room . For the first time , standing in this doorway of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Natalie knew a certain pride of ownership . This was , after all , the only room she had ever known where she would be , privately , working out her own salvation . Briefly , she thought of long nights alone in this room ( no one to notice her light , no one to tap on her door and ask was she all right , dear ) and long afternoons spent at the narrow desk in the corner , writing whatever she pleased and perhaps making only silly pictures on paper if she chose . If she liked , she might lock her door . If she pleased , she could entertain here ; if it suited her pleasure , she could shut the windows , open the windows , move the bed , upset the chairs , go in the closet and hide . A purely mechanical love possessed her ; the numberon the door  --  it was 27 ; a good number , owning a seven for luck and a two for work , and adding , triumphantly , to nine  --  belonged only to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and know that her own dear possessions were surely inside . Tomorrow morning , she thought , and leaned back happily against the door , she would wake up in this room . For the whole first afternoon that she was alone at college Natalie asked herself constantly , Is this meaningful ? Is this important ? Is this part of what I am to go home knowing ? They sat around the living room of the house , the girls who were to live in it , eying one another , each one wonder/ing , perhaps , which of the others was to be her particular friend , sought out hereafter at such meetings , joined in the terrible sacred friendship of these years . Each one wondering , perhaps , who it was just and right to be afraid of in the room : who , for instance , was to be the belle of the house , superior and embarrassing with her greater knowledge , her secrets ? The ones who had been senior queens in high school stood out , the one or two who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , the learners of facts , the ascetic amateur writers with their poems safely locked away upstairs ; the hangersonwere there , eying the beauty queens , estimating clearly which one it were best to appropriate immediately . The poor ones , with their obvious best clothes , the smart ones , with their obvious right clothes , the girls who would teach the others to dance , the girls who would whisper inaccurate facts of life , the girls who would creep out the cellar window , the girls who would tell tales or steal or have nervous breakdowns , the girls who would fail all their courses and go home ingloriously ( saying goodbye bravely , but crying ) , the girls who would fail all their courses and join the best cliques , the girls who would fall in love with their professors , either desperately and secretly , or openly and disgracefully , the girls whose hearts would break and the girls whose spirits would break  --  a group of girls from whatever kind of homes , with whatever agonized mothers wondering , tonight , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preliminary steps of an education . They sat , murmuring , in the living room of the house they were going to live in , which was to replace whatever houses they had left that morning or the day before or thep67week before , the old houses still so clear in their minds and so much home , to be so soon replaced by this one , with its careful undistinguished furnishings , designed to be neither better than the worst homes left behind , nor worse than the best ; the living room where the perfect college girl could entertain , circumspectly , her immaculate date . It was designed to form a reasonable and not too indicative background for any of the girls who lived in it ( who would , of course , never have lived in it if they had not been that most clearly indicated of all types , the college girl ) , and thoughtfully chosen to harmonize with the best college fashions being shown in the smartest middle-price department stores ( in all cities ; ask for the College Shoppe or the Sub-Deb Salon or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , fifth floor , pen and pencil sets on the main floor , stationery ) ; its discreet neutral walls , the green-and-gray-striped chairs , the helpless vases on the mantel , the picture over the fireplace , which may have been of a past president of the college or of a financial lover of education  --  all were so carefully devoid of personalitythat the room as a whole reduced conversation to the exact level which a well-bred girl would choose . Natalie , accustomed to rooms and to company which were , as a complete unit , intended to bring out the maximumpersonality any given organism possessed , felt smotheredby the room and by her companions . She sat in a corner , on the floor because when she came in after an uncomfortablefarewell to her mother and father and brother , still carrying the money her father had pressed into her hand and the box of cookies her mother had nearly forgotten , more girls were sitting on the floor than on chairs and be/cause by now all the chairs were taken by girls who had obviously exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying not to seem looking , at the other girls in the room . There was one directly opposite who had bright-red hair , and who was laughing and talking with several girls around her ; more girls were listening and edging nearer , and Natalie , drawing back from that side of the room , thought , There is someone I will know only slightly . The girl next to her had hair that grew in an ugly line across her forehead , and when Natalie risked saying , after rehearsing it for some minutes , " Do you know any of these people ? " the girl said , " No , " briefly , eyed Natalie for a minute , and then looked away . She is not looking for me , Natalie thought , and the girl on her other side was not looking for Natalie either ; as Natalie turned to her , to repeat her question , she rose quickly and went to join the group by the red-haired girl . Will they all notice that I am sitting almost alone ? Natalie wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and night , when she looked at herself in her mirror , with a comb in her hand ? Did the girl near Nataliebewail secretly the ugly line of her hair , and persuade herself that she was more aware of it than anyone else ? Was someone regarding Natalie , identifying her by some **27;5683;TOOLONG which Natalie did not know or had forgotten or had convinced herself that no one saw ? Was it not possible that the girl over there , in the blue dress , had put the dress on that morning wondering if it would do for her first day at college ? Because it would not , and had she spent the day concerned with it , or had she forgotten it immediately she put it on ? Had the mother of the one inp69green told her not to forget her pills ? Was the one with glasses afraid of waking in the night , alone ? Which of them had come to college hoping secretly to meet a thin nervous girl named Natalie ? Did she expect Natalie to recognize her first ? And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting so immediately , so fearfully ? Was something going to happen ? Natalie had already discovered that it was not possible to think clearly in this bedlam , any more than it was possible to act clearly . All thoughts and actions were called for so quickly , were so subject to immediate and drastic change , that she dared not try to rise to go upstairs and find her room again , and she dared not estimate finally the probable characters of the girls in the room , for fear that , in either case , someone should look at her and laugh ; suddenly , permanently , seeing her as , " That girl who . .. " Then without warning the room quieted , and Natalie perceivedthat the red-haired girl was standing . " Shall I ? " she said to someone sitting near her , as one who has intended to all the time and merely expects public confirmation ; the girls around her nodded and spoke urgently , and the red-haired girl turned prettily to the room , spread her hands , and said , " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other . After all , we 'll be living in the same house for a long time . " Everyone laughed as though , unexpectedly , she had voiced the hidden dismay of them all , and the red-haired girl said , " I 'll go first . My name 's Peggy Spencer , and I came here from Central High School in  --  " The girl next to Natalie , the one with the unpleasant hair , leaned over suddenly and said to Natalie , " Is n't she cute ? "  |p70Cute  ? Natalie thought . " She certainly is , " she whisperedback . Around the circle of girls , each one in turn announced her name and her immediate past record . Each one , speaking her own name in a voice she had rarely heard pronounce it , was more or less embarrassed ; when Natalie 's turn came , and the girl next to her had identified herself as Adelaide something or other from some school or other , and turned expectantly to Natalie , as one who sees an ordeal safely past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly able to say clearly , " My name is Natalie Waite . " Is it my name ? she wondered then , afraid for a minute that she had appropriated the name of the next girl , or of someone she had met slightly once and remembered only in the recesses of her mind which seemed called upon unreasonably to function now , socially , and without experience . The name passed without comment , perhaps because no one was listening , actually , to any name other than her own . After each , then , had with shame called upon herself to stand forth alone , the red-haired girl , without so much pretty confusion , said in the voice of one to whom amateur parliamentary proceedure is familiar ( " Well , of course it will be Peggy Spencer for vice-president . . . " ) , " All right , then , since we 're all frosh together , we ought to settle any problems we 've got right now . " Frosh , Natalie thought , problems . Are the problems tobe settled here ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second day ( waking up delightedly into thestrange room , dressing alone without the certain knowledge of her mother moving downstairs , putting away her ownp71things , selecting her own places for underwear in the dresser , books on the shelves , papers in the desk ) she was able to find her own room without being puzzled by the stairs or the length of the hall . She had taken to stayingaround the floor bathroom at bedtime , with the rest of the girls , asking odd , uncertain questions of the others as they did of her , laughing at jokes whose inevitable point was the uncanny ability of new students to outwit old students , shouting meaninglessly at people she hardly knew . She knew the name of almost everyone on the floor ; the red-haired girl , who was already running for some freshman office or other , nodded cordially to her whenever they passed on the stairs , the girl with the ugly hair sat next to her at breakfast one morning .

As one who wakens to find his city destroyed and himself alone in the ruins , Natalie found herself a rude shelter , food , and comfort , by a system almost scavenging .

Natalie , fumbling , turned on her light and looked , as though it were important , at the clock : three o'clock . That meant it was the middle of the night , and her mind , suddenly concerned lest its own signal system be awry , moved quickly over obligations and commitments . No class at this hour , surely , no appointments . A fire , then ? Something wholly beyond her own jurisdiction ? A murder ? Perhaps in the room next door ?

A dream , so that she should stand in a moment , shivering and miserable , alone in the hall while doors opened up and down the length of the building and curious , mocking faces peered out , saying , " What is she doing ? " and answering , " She dreamed , she dreamed she was a freshman and it was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she keeps asking what her name is , she does n't seem to know where she is . . . " ) " I am a freshman , " she said aloud , and , quickened by a sudden excitement , she swung out of bed and into a bathrobe . " College , " she told herself cynically , hurrying with the bathrobe cord , " initiation , " stuffing her feet into her slippers . She opened her door , tentative at the last moment , to find the hall lights on and the hall full of nervous , curious , bathrobed girls . " Where do we go ? " someone asked Natalie immediately , perhaps assuming from her late exit from her own room that she had some special inside information.  | " I do n't know , " Natalie said . " We better stay here . " " I understand , " said someone , and giggled , " that they make us . . . " The rest of her words were most unfortunatelylost to Natalie , whose arm had been seized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized by a voice saying , " Frosh ? This way . " Resenting again the movie word " frosh " ( and , to a certaindegree knowing curiosity tempered with excitement , so that she thought consciously , in the midst of an unwantedfear , So this is why they always pick the middle of the night for things to happen ! and knew she had hit upon something very profound ) , Natalie followed the firm hand , and the rest of the girls followed her . Behind her someone still giggled , someone still said , " But where are we going ? " Someone insisted nervously , " I 'm not sure my doctor . . . " " Where are we going ? " Natalie asked the person leading her ; she discovered with strong embarrassment that this person was masked with a handkerchief over her face , tied approximately at the back of her head ; this cops-and-robberseffect conveyed to Natalie the fact that the night 's escapade ( she did not phrase it to herself like this until much later , however ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their faces uncovered ; there was about her conductor a faint air of many people provokingone another , saying , " Go on , I dare you . . . go on ; you look wonderful ; I will if you will , " and the intoxication which comes of a deed hallowed in tradition but uncertainly remembered in detail . " Shut up , " Natalie was told , in answer to her question , and she thought of how bold the lack of a face made one , and , perhaps , how not having a face of one 's own mightp74lead to universal peace , since a face was , after all , only . . . " In here , " said the faceless creature . It was extraordinary how not having faces had changed the bodies of the girls in the house . Falteringly , Natalie was able to pick out two or three , but , reflecting that she had known them at best only by their make-up and the way they did their hair , she was forced to distrust her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . One , who seemed to have constituted herself leader , remarkedas Natalie , first in line , was brought in , " Do you have any qualification for entering here ? " They were sitting in a semicircle on the floor , all masked as foolishly as the girl who had brought her , all wearing their own pajamas , which surely their mothers , picking them out , had not destined for such midnight purposes ; or , indeed , had they ? Did the mothers of such girls encourage their superiority , egg them on to masked acts ? Did they , sending their daughters off to college , remark , as last-minuteadvice , " And , dearest , remember , when you get after the frosh . . . do please wear your blue-and-white-striped p. j. ' s  --  they look the best , and they 'll stand the splinters in that floor . . . " No , I was brought , " said Natalie , and received for rewarda push from the girl who had brought her , so that she fell clumsily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very humanly , " Cut it out , " and pushed back . Now I will keep quiet , Natalie thought , knowing  --  and it was not , after all , any too soon to learn  --  the resignation of a perceptive mind before gleeful freed brutality  --  and let someone else get pushed.  | "  --  for entering here ? " the leader was asking the next girl . " I do n't know , " said the girl uncertainly , and was pushed . As that girl dropped down next to Natalie , she whispered , trembling , " I wish I 'd never come . " " Me , too , " said Natalie inadequately . She found that she was thinking absurdly of Jeanne d'Arc ; perhaps the next girl , or the one after that , would turn in contempt from the leader , and , addressing a dim figure in the background , drop to her knees and say , " You , Sire , are my king ... " After the first few girls , their mentor was tired of pushingthem  --  perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  and they were allowed to seat themselves quietly . No one spoke , and beyond their mutual and spreading apprehension came the sure conviction among the freshmen that their superiors had exceeded themselves , that the " I will if you will " had begun to evaporate , with the laughter and the bad puns ; that the torment they had devised extended perhaps to one or two girls and could not , for sheer bodily weariness , be repeated , over and over again , for twenty . Moreover , it became increasingly clear that the party had fallen flat , that the pure number of girls entering docilely had worn thin the viciousness in the voice of the leader , that she and her cohorts were going to skim over the last few girls , relying for their effect upon the first few , and , perhaps even with discomfort for themselves , let the businessgo to pieces now without further emphasizing their futility ; the part of wisdom lay clearly in choosing the weakest first . Natalie , at least , felt a grateful relief when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader waited until allp76the freshmen were in , and crowded uneasily onto the floor , and sitting or kneeling , then pointed to a girl in the middle and said , " You , there . " It crossed Natalie 's mind then that if she had stayed in her room quietly and never heeded the call to frosh , she would have been overlooked , since no one seemed to care about those who did not come . With this in mind , Natalie turned cautiously and scanned the ranks of freshmen for the red-haired girl , but did not find her . Another instance , she thought regretfully ( or at least remembered later that she had so thought ) , of ritual gone to seed ; the persecutionof new students , once passionate , is now only perfunctory . The girl chosen was required to sit upon a low stool in what was , most of them now recognized , the center of the second-floor lavatory  --  the largest in the house , and the one with most floor space  --  and she was required further to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though that had not all been gone over before by people more qualified to know , and then the leader , hesitating and prompted , had chosen to confer with a colleague rather than to continue the questioning immediately . Then someonefrom the masked circle around the new students said , " Look , we 're all allowed to ask questions , are n't we ? " " Sure , " said the leader , with obvious gratitude . " Then listen , Myrna , " said the girl happily , from behind her mask , " you a virgin ? " Natalie saw the freshman blushing full-face and the upperclassmenblushing behind and above their masks , and thought , I hope they do n't ask me , and , It 's the girls withp77masks on their faces blushing too . Could it be , she wonderedtiredly , that a mask is no protection at all ? " Certainly , " said the girl on the stool , surprised at the question , and blushing as well as the rest . " Tell us a dirty joke , then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the girl , writhing , obviously repressinga seemingly forgotten story that came unfortunatelyto mind . " I do n't listen to those . " " Excused , " said the leader . The girl came off the stool and retired , blushing and explaining , to oblivion among her friends ; she had passed ; she had at that moment taken on a protective coloration among the general run of girls in the house ; she was not in any way eccentric , but a good , normal , healthy , American college girl , with ideals and ambitionsand looking forward to a family of her own ; she had merged . " Next , " said the leader . She gestured at random , and her gesture was answered with alacrity by someone who , seatingherself on the stool , showed that she , and no other , was possessed of the information the masked girls wanted to hear , and that she was , in addition , prepared to lie valiantlyto deprive them of it and to exalt herself in the eyes of the freshmen girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed the circle defiantly , as though daring any of them to match her siren experience or to question it . Natalie , who needed abruptly to establish her own position , leaned to the girl next to her and whispered , " I wo n't answer them . " " Shhh , " said the girl next to her , bending forward to hearp78the victim on the stool , who was delivering the punch-line of a joke . The girls in the masks did not laugh , or at least did not show beyond the masks that they were laughing . " That 's not very dirty , " said one . " It 's the best I know , " said the girl on the stool innocently . " Excused , " said the leader helplessly . Then , unbearably , unbelievably , she looked squarely at Natalie . " You , " she said . " No , " said Natalie , but the desire to assume the stool , if not the confessional , drove her . Sitting in the center of light , with everyone watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard core of defiance with which she might always face unknown faces staring ; she knew with strength that it would be as easy , or even easier , to resist than to expose herself . She gave her name ( was it her name ? ) and then , when asked if she were a virgin  --  and this question , gaining adherentsfrom the unkind and the merely curious , was being asked now by three or four voices at once , and even , Nataliesaw from the high point of the stool , being echoed by the traitor freshmen themselves  --  said briefly , " I wo n't an-swer . " The worst she had expected was another push , but obviouslyeveryone was afraid to push her with everyone else watching ; no single girl there dared expose her own self ( " Are you a virgin ? Well ? " ) with any untoward gesture by now ; no single girl dared , however much she desired , take on the limelight ; because perhaps by now one small gesture of resistance from the freshmen would have dissolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing off their masks , saying , " It was her idea  --  I would n't have done it at all except . . . Someone said menacingly that she had better tell , and someone else said that if she did n't want to tell , well , that proved it . " Tell a dirty joke , " said the leader . " I will not , " said Natalie , who , like everyone else there , was more afraid of being found not to know dirty jokes than of being found to have a rich supply . " Do n't you know enough jokes ? " " Bad sport , " someone called , and then others took it up . " Bad sport , rotten sport , not fair . " What a silly routine , Natalie thought , not realizing , sitting there alone on the stool in the center of the ring of girls , how she was jeopardizing her own future in college , her own future for four years and perhaps for the rest of her life ; how even worse than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which led her into defiance of this norm , this ring of placid , masked girls , with their calm futuresahead and their regular pasts proven beyond a doubt ; how one person , stepping however aside from their meaningless , echoing standards , set perhaps by a violent movementbefore their recollection , and handed down to them by other placid creatures , might lose a seat among them by questions , by rebellion , by anything except a cheerful smile and the resolution to hurt other people . " I wo n't , " Natalie said , not knowing whom she was answering . " Excused , " said the leader . Natalie , realizing that she must relinquish the stool and the light , said as she rose ( and loud enough , she hoped , top80carry to the fortunate girls still asleep , the red-haired girl and the others who had not answered the call ) , " I think this is the silliest thing I ever saw . " Follow me , she prayed to the girls still sitting in the ring , follow me , stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one , standing up beside her , or even raising her voice or her eyes , noticed Natalie by now . " Dirty joke ? " the leader was saying to the new girl . " I do n't know , " said the new girl , blushing pleasurably . " Let me think . " Natalie opened the door , observed but not interfered with , and went out . She went , alone and with a realization of aloneness , to her own private , untouched , room . Dear Dad , This is going to be my most ambitious letter to date , and please do n't criticize , because I am writing fast and not stopping to correct , and even though that might be the way to get things down best , it makes for a lot of mistakes . Becausethis is going to be about the college . I know you saw it that first day when you and Mother and Bud brought me down , but at that time we were all strange and did n't know what it was like , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like two years , really ) I feel so much at home here that I do n't really remember what it was like to live anywhere else , and I sometimes think of how that first day is all you know of the place , and you still see it like that , and I ca n't remember . First of all , let me tell you about my house . I guess you saw most of it when I moved in  --  and by the way , that wasp81the only time I saw it that way , like a stranger with her mother and father and brother , I mean , because right after you left it got all different and I started feeling like a collegegirl who lived here . Do you know what I 'm trying to say ? Anyway , the house you saw is n't the one , I think , that I live in at all . By now it 's turned into something where girls are yelling and laughing and feeling somehow completelyprivate , and sort of in a world of their own . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you know . I have a little room , like all the other rooms they give to freshmen . The third- and fourth-year students can have double rooms or suites , but the freshmen and usually the second-year students have rooms alone . Our house is supposed to be the best because it 's attached to the dining room and kitchens , and the girls here only have to go down the stairs and down a hall to get their dinner . Some of the others have to come all the way across the campus , from the other houses we saw . The main part of the campus is a long lawn , where we sit on warm evenings , and I keep thinking about that lawn , because , when I saw it the first day I was with you and Mother and Bud , I kept thinking how I was ever going to find my way back across it and get to my own house , and now I think I know every tree on it , and I go up and down the paths every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the big building at the end of the lawn , but one class  --  Langdon 's English I  --  is usually held outdoors on the lawn or else in the living room of our house . Some of the girls here asked him to have the class here instead of in a lecture hall so he said yes and the college said OK . I like it better because you can sit in a comfortable chair andp82smoke and not in a lecture room . There 's more noise , though , and girls keep opening the doors and starting to come in and then they always get scared and excuse themselves and run out . I get up as early as I can in the morning , but it 's usually just in time for my eight-o'clock class , which is music two days a week and philosophy another two . Classes last an hour and a half , and I get terribly sleepy along about nine o'clock , especially since I do n't usually have time for breakfast and I get hungry too . Then at nine-thirty I usually go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of course I usually run into my professors there , because somehow everyone always goes there between classes . Then at ten o'clock two days a week , after music , I go to French , which I hate . I would drop it only I 'd have to take something like Spanish instead . They wo n't let you graduatewithout one year of language . Lots of people think Spanish is easier . And I have a sociology course two afternoonsa week , and the other two afternoons , of course , is English with Arthur Langdon . That 's supposed to be an hour and a half too , but it 's usually longer because we all stay around talking to him . I guess he 's the most popular person on the campus . He runs the beauty contest before the Senior Dance . The meals are terrible . They have a kind of salad made of sliced bananas and peanuts , and it seems like we have it five times a week . Also liver . And the coffee is no good , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played some tennis yesterday with a girl named Helen something . I went down to the courts to practice , and she was there and asked if I wanted to play so I said yes . Ip83was n't half good enough for her , and we only played one set . We 're going to try again sometime when I 'm more used to these courts . I 'm looking forward to coming home for a weekend but guess I 'll be too busy for a while yet . I 'm working hard and having a fine time , and I 'm very glad to be here . We 're starting Romeo and Juliet in English next week . Tell Mother I am well and I think I am gaining weight . In spite of the bad food , I eat a lot more here than I did at home . Tell her I could use a box of cookies or a cake , lots of the girls get packages from home . I guess there are about three hundred girls here . Some very nice ones . Lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside ; the one window of Natalie 's room showed black when she had the light on , and pale when she had the light off . When the light was off the room was beautiful and shadowy , with the light from the window moving gently onto the bright bedspread , touching slightly the paper on the desk , coming to rest on Natalie 's own hands and the page of the open book before her . When , reluctantly , she turned the light on again  --  feeling that to seem to be abed at this hour was somehow disgraceful , and indicated perhaps a guilty conscience or perhapseven loneliness  --  the window fell black and the bed became square and neatly made , and the corners of things became then apparent , from the corners of the room to the corners of the book , and the feet of the desk on the floor were somehow obscene.  |p84She  was not trying to study ; the fact of study was still strange to her , so that she read with appetite the freshmanEnglish textbook , and took novels from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering mind the textbookof biology ( having read , the first day , as had everyone in the class , the chapter on human reproduction ) , and saw no pattern and no meaning in the French text , the sociology book ( past the chapter on prostitution ) , and regardedwith blank contempt the book which very likely held all the world 's carefully alphabetical facts upon the analysis of words  --  learned , very likely , and infinitely carefulabout theories , but duller than words had any right to be . For music , fortunately , she had only to arise at eight the next morning with both ears still attached to her head ; so long as her ears were there , the fact that she did not use them to listen enthusiastically was unimportant to the music lecturer . For philosophy she had long ago evolved a complex and  --  she suspected  --  meaningless theory , which she kept by her in case the professor should raise his old head , ever , and look in her direction . " Sir , " she meant to say brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind thinks he does , then would n't it be true that . . . " A knock on her door was as strange a thing to her as the fact of the door itself ; at first she thought , It is across the hall , how clearly it sounds ; then she thought , It is a mistake ; she wasted a minute thinking of someone looking at the outside of the door steadfastly , as she looked at the inside , and meant to mark the next day whether the panels outside were the same as those inside ; odd , she thought , that someone standing outside could look at the door ,  |p85straight  ahead , seeing the white paint and the wood , and I inside looking at the door and the white paint and the wood should look straight also , and we two looking should not see each other because there is something in the way . Are two people regarding the same thing not looking at each other ? The knock came again . " Come in , " occurred to Natalie then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was locked , so she stumbled , hastily and spilling her book , off the bed and across the room and finally remembered how to turn the key and open the door . " Yes ? " she said blindly , now that the door was removed . " Hello , " said the girl outside ; Natalie remembered , as though once the door was opened the world outside it slowly established itself , small section after small section  --  as though , in fact , it had not been prepared tonight for Natalie to open her door again , and had been caught completelyunaware , and was putting a bold face on things and getting everything back together as quickly as possible , so that Natalie should not perceive it , looking through her door , and say , " Just as I thought ; this confirms everything I have always suspected "  --  she remembered , slowly , seeing the girl 's face before and then , that her name was Rosalind . " Hello , " Natalie said . " Are you busy ? " Rosalind said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her room . " I mean , I just thought I 'd come over and say hello , but if you 're busy . . . " " No , " said Natalie , surprised . " I 'm not at all busy . " She stood away from the door , and Rosalind came into thep86room , looking around curiously , as though she had not left one just like it immediately before , although perhaps Rosalind'sbedspread was blue instead of patterned , and she had perhaps been reading different books , and the clothes in the closet would of course be different . " I wanted to talk to someone , " Rosalind offered ; once in , she sat quickly on the bed and tucked her feet under her . " I saw your light on and thought that since we did n't know each other very well it might be a good time to come and make friends with you . " " I 'm glad , " Natalie said . She was happy at having been disturbed ; her books would still be there after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions Rosalindmight have brought with her ? Natalie sat uneasily on the desk chair , knowing it was her duty to speak , and able to think of nothing but the list of irregular French verbs she would not be able to remember half so clearly tomorrow . " I was just trying to do my French , " she said , with an embarrassed laugh that she deplored . " French , " Rosalind said , and shuddered . " I 'm glad I took Spanish . " " Is Spanish terribly hard ? " Natalie asked politely . " Listen , " Rosalind said , obviously feeling that the amenitieswere over and it was time to get down to business , " do you know any of the girls around here ? " " No , " said Natalie , " not very many . " Not that I want to know them , she longed to add , I 'm very careful about my friends , I dislike knowing lots of people , I do n't make friends easily because I keep them for a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to my studies . . . " Not any of them , really , " Natalie said.  | " That 's what I thought , " Rosalind said ! " Did you ever see anything like them ? I mean , they certainly are n't very friendly . " " I have n't really tried  --  " Natalie said . " Peggy Spencer and her friends , " Rosalind said disdainfully . " Helen Burton and her friends . . . and such a noise going on all night . I ca n't even sleep . " " I 've never had any trouble getting to sleep , " Natalie said eagerly . " We ought to show them they 're not so very special , " Rosalind said . She lifted her chin and shrugged . " You go into one of their rooms and they 're all there and they stop talking and say , Yes ? ' as though you were a beggar until you turn around and go and then you can hear them laughingafter you shut the door . I do n't think they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never gone into any of their rooms , " Natalie said , feeling that she had an end of this conversation to keep up . " Well , you know what they say about you , " Rosalind said . She looked at Natalie as though for the first time aware of the particular person she was addressing , calling to mind this person 's special liabilities . " They say you 're crazy . You sit here in your room all day and all night and never go out and they say you 're crazy . " " I go out to class , " Natalie said quickly . " They say you 're spooky , " Rosalind said . " That 's what they call you , Spooky , I heard them . " " Who ? " Natalie said . " Who knows what I do ? " " Well , I think it 's your own business , " said Rosalind critically . " I mean , everyone has the right to live the way they want , and naturally none of them has any right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live their own way . " Feeling a sudden quick warmth toward Rosalind for not having watched her , Natalie said , " All I want them to do is leave me alone . " " Well , that 's what I say , " Rosalind said , " but if you really do n't belong to their little crowd , naturally they think you 're crazy , and they never even stop to think that maybe you and I do n't want to run around with people like that , and what I 'd like to know is how does anyone get to belong with them if they look at you like you were a beggar and then laugh when you go out ? Does it really seem fair ? " " What they think is actually not at all important , " Nataliesaid with dignity . Even as she spoke she knew her position , and her mind , racing ahead of her , was counting over its special private blessings : there was her father , of course , although he seemed , right now , far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fact that she seemed , more than any other , to be comprehending and alert in his class , and had received a sort of recognition , as though they were kindred , from him  --  but then perhaps , she thought , frightened , perhaps not everyone thought of ArthurLangdon 's regard as special . Perhaps he was not so valuable to these watching , laughing girls as other things Natalie had never heard of . But then , of course , there was always and beyond all laughter and beyond all scrutiny her own sweet dear home of a mind , where she was safe , protected , priceless . . . " They 're trivial people , really . Me-diocre. "  | " Try and get anywhere without them , " Rosalind said cynically . " They 're everything . " Not everything , Natalie thought hastily , not quite everything . Not the place ten , fifteen , twenty years from now , the place of pure honor and glory , from which one perhaps looked down and said , " Who ? What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ? In college ? Dear heaven , so long ago . . . " They get away with murder , " . Rosalind said . " Think any of them has to do what we do ? " She put out her lip sullenlyand began to swing one foot back and forth . Looking at her , Natalie saw clearly what had not seemed important before now : that Rosalind was squat and ugly , and had a drab dull face and a faint growth of hair on her upper lip . " Listen , " Rosalind said , " you know that girl , the skinny one who 's such a good friend of Peggy Burton 's ? The one they call Max , because her name 's Maxine ? Well , the reason she went away last weekend was because she had an abor-tion . " " Oh , " said Natalie . " Heard them talking about it through the door , " Rosalind said . " And Peggy Burton  --  she 's only been lucky . You know that guy of hers , the football player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie . " I mean , " she said , " not that I want to repeat scandal , but they 're all like that . We ought to be thankful we do n't have more to do with them . I mean , I 'm sure the college people know all about them , and if you hang around with them , first thing you know they think the same about you . " " About me ? " said Natalie . Far off , in the untouched ,  |p90lonely  places of her mind , an echo came : It is n't true , it did n't happen .. . " Not that either of us , " Rosalind said , and laughed lightly . " I mean , " she said , looking again at Natalie , " I know about me , and I guess about you . " Pride caught at Natalie ; here was this hideous girl attemptingan alliance on the grounds that Natalie was  --  what ? was there a word ? ( Innocent ? Who was innocent  --  this girl with her nasty eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant clear and clean and could not include this Rosalind with her low coarse face ; untouched ? Spotless ? Pure ? ) Could I , Natalie thought , in the second when her eyes met Rosalind 's , could I possibly associateon any grounds with this girl ? Whichever way I speak , she will follow me . " It is n't true , " she said . " Of course it 's true , " Rosalind said indignantly . " Do n't I hear them talking every night through the wall ? Some nights they 're in there giggling until I think I 'll go crazy , things you and I do n't even think about , much less talk about , and then when I pound on the wall you 'd think I was the one , the way they yell back . " " I mean , " Natalie said apologetically , " if we do n't meddlewith them . . . Rosalind shrugged . " I just think it 's terrible , " she said , " them thinking they 're so good , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one wants to be in their crowd , for fear of having people think things about them . " Suddenly ( and it gave a sudden clear picture of her decision to come here in the first place : suddenly , on a phrase , perhaps not even considered , so that she knocked on Natalie'sdoor at random , because it was the third from thep91end of the hall , or because the door somehow resembled , in some mystic , impossible way , the door to her own room , far away at home ) she rose , pushed her hair back with an unattractive gesture , and said wearily , " Anyway , I would n't want anyone knowing I had anything to do with them . " " Of course not , " said Natalie helplessly ; she answered the girl 's leaving as she had answered her coming , without volition , without desire , without conviction . " Listen , " said Rosalind , as though it were a sudden idea , " let 's go to breakfast together tomorrow . OK ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So do I , " said Rosalind . " I 'll come and knock on your door about seven-thirty . You be ready . " " I do n't know if I 'll have breakfast before class , " Natalie said . " I always wake up so late  --  " " I 'll see that you 're up , " Rosalind said . " We 'll show them they 're not the only people in the world . OK ? " FROM Natalie 's secret journal : Dearest dearest darling most important dearest darling Natalie  --  this is me talking , your own priceless own Natalie , and I just wanted to tell you one single small thing : you are the best , and they will know it someday , and someday no one will ever dare laugh again when you are near , and no one will dare even speak to you without bowing first .

Someday , someone , somewhere . Natalie , pleaseIn the class named philosophy , Natalie appeared two mornings a week , although it was not proven that Mr. ( Doctor by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Subjunctive in Plato "  --  had not yet found a completion ) Desmond noticed , particularly , whether or not Miss Waite had chosen to attend any given morning . Under her father 's tender care , Natalie had been formally introduced to both Plato and Aristotle , but had never , until now , been required to digest such ideas reduced to the probable , or diagram , level of the schoolgirl mind . The man  --  that would be Mr. ( to be Doctor ) Desmond  --  who taught this class , and who had named it philosophy , obviously felt that anyone who had spent years studying his subject should by rights end up as something rather better than a man trying to teach ideas to girls , or at least as something more reconciled ; he was bitter and impatient , and made his own intimate friend Plato as disagreeable as possible , perhaps to keep the uneager girls from intrudin4p93unwarily into some secret philosophical circle , where bittermen who taught philosophy drank deeply of clear wine with the Platos and Berkeleys , the Descartes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of philosophers : philo : love ; sophia : wisdom . " Nothing , " the philosopher might remark at sometime after nine in the morning , fingering his gray tie , or touchingwith uncertain fingers his pockets ; or merely eying unenthusiasticallythe penciling girls in the front rows , " nothing , " he would say thoughtfully and with some relish , " nothing in the world exists in a perfect form . " Nothing in the world exists in a perfect form , Natalie wrote in her notebook , feeling as she wrote that there just might be something . " How about a vacuum ? " the girl next to her said unexpectedly . There was a silence . The professor ( so soon to be DoctorDesmond ) stared , repeated to himself : What about a vacuum ? and raised his eyebrows slightly . " Well , " he said , his surprise not yet demonstrated to his own satisfaction , " what about a vacuum ? " One heard  --  or rather , perhaps , only Natalie heard  --  the faint murmur as Plato leant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? What was it ? " the learned teachers of philosophyall raising their eyebrows and smiling at one another , telling one another perhaps , " Science . . . science . " " Well , " said the girl next to Natalie , who was suddenly discovered by both Natalie and the girl on the other side of her to be a clumsy creature , given to raw blushing , and undoubtedly not finely drawn in mind , " I mean , when you say there 's nothing perfect ? "  | " Nothing in the world exists in a perfect form , " the professormurmured , watchfully . " Yes , I said it . " " Well , " the girl said ; she stared straight at the professor ; to confound a professor of philosophy midway through the first month of the first semester of your first year . . . " Well , " she repeated , " I mean  --  what about a vacuum ? I mean , that 's perfect , is n't it ? " Natalie perceived that one of the junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , overeager , anxious to establish himself among the select , hurried with his joke , and was hushed by the others , and drew even a shade of a frown from the Bishop himself ; would these impetuous young fellows never learn their equivocal standing ?  --  and the professor , at whom the student was staring entranced , looked quickly , once , around the class , opened his mouth , and smiled . There was , on alternate mornings , the class named history of music , and here the professor was a man equally thwarted , but happy about it nevertheless ; he was ridden by a sort of genius , and felt strongly that it was far more valuable for college freshmen to participate two mornings in the week in the intricate , subtle , unendingly lovely convolutionsof a genius mind than to concern themselves tidily with dates and composers , the whole-tone scale , the castrati . " Listen , " he told them one morning , too soon after breakfast , and he held up one finger of one long hand in a gracefuleloquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " He selected , with the quick decisive motions of a manp95captivated by a thought he can not elude , a volume from the stack on the desk ; although his air was one of unpremeditateddesire , he had nevertheless remembered to procurein advance copies of the music to pass among the girls in the front row . Natalie , who sat at the end of the front row nearest the piano , was thus able to follow the music and the professor 's playing together , and found it perhaps as little instructive as anything she had ever heard ; she was accustomed to listen to music rarely , and then in strict solitude , with her eyes shut and various odd glories in her head ; she could read barely enough muisc to perceivethat the professor consistently played a sharp where a double-sharp was written . To confound a professor of music midway through the first month of the first semester of the first year . . . At the end of the class Natalie stopped at the desk where the professor was modestly disclaiming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Natalie with his smile ready , she said meekly , " Please , may I ask you something ? " Where did you study ? Is it a natural talent ? Why do you not compose ? The continuing smile on the professor 's face showed Natalie that she had not made her question quite clear . " I mean , " she said , " here  --  " she had the book open , her finger on the spot , all ready "  --  you always played a sharp and is n't this a double-sharp ? I mean , " she added , in the face of his uncomprehending smile , " I just wondered , while you were playing . " " Playing very badly , by the way , " he said , still smiling , and raising one hand gracefully against the low voice of protest , in which Natalie , to her eternal recognized cow/ardice , found herself joining . " No , " he said , " I really did play badly . One knows . " " But  --  " Natalie said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , his hand on Natalie 's arm , his face turned toward the other girls , " this girl listens to music , as  --  how shall I say it ?  --  as an artist . Perhaps music has a meaning for her beyond what it has for the rest of us . " Perhaps it has , Natalie thought ; I am fairly beaten . Desiringto retire with an understanding grin and a knowledgeablelook , she turned when the professor spoke to someone else and went softly away , no one turning to look after her . At the beginning of her second month at college , one day Natalie turned a corner suddenly ( where was she going ? what was she running from ? She was never able to rememberafterwards , since at the moment the incoherence of her life dissolved and she became again a functioning person , somewhat later than the red-haired Peggy Spencer , perhaps , but still much sooner than many of the girls around her ) and crashed into someone who , picking her up , said , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many corners perfectly , " I 'm terribly sorry ; I should have looked where I was going . " " My fault , " Natalie said . She had not dropped anything , otherwise she could have hidden her face searching for it on the ground . As it was , she was forced to observe that she had run into a woman , who was a woman as surely as Natalie was a girl , since where Natalie was unconnected and vague , this other was purposeful and compact . " You all right ? " the woman asked the girl . " You 're new , are n't you ? "  |p97Natalie  , blessing her for avoiding the hateful word frosh , nodded and looked up . A pretty woman . " New , " Natalie confessed , " and confused . And frightened , I guess . " " Everyone is , " the woman said . She hesitated , and Natalie , who was these days forming estimates about people because she feared speaking to them , imagined that the woman had had a destination and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' desire to be helplessand the pride against being helped by a woman who might be , after all , inadequate , made Natalie say dismissingly , " I suppose I 'll get over it . " She pretended to be ready to walk on , but , blessedly , the woman decided suddenly , and turned to walk with her . " I was new here recently , " the woman said and smiled . " I 'm Elizabeth Langdon , " she said . " My husband teaches English . I used to be a student . " And that 's all she knows to tell me about herself , Natalie thought , and said , " Oh , yes . I believe I 'm in one of Mr. Langdon 's classes . At least , " she added doubtfully , for fear of being thought by his wife to have a crush on Mr. Langdon , " I think it 's his class . " " Is he short , with a mustache ? " the woman asked , as though it were of some importance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Dark , " Natalie decided , remembering the slim figure which moved gracefully before the class , speaking with humorous informality of Shakespeare ; suppressing quickly and emphatically the recollection of her own vague daydreams ( " Miss Waite ? I do n't suppose you remember me ? Well , I 'm Arthur Langdon ; I want to tell you that your performance of Portia was . . . " ) . " Of course , it must be Mr. Langdon . It 's just that , being so new here ... "  | " Of course . " The woman sounded relieved , still giving the impression that the point had been important . " Has he begun to quote Suetonius yet ? " Natalie suddenly wanted to make a good impression on the wife of the slim figure who might , at any moment , quote Suetonius . " My father , " she said , " says that people only quote when they ca n't make a point any other way . " " I see , " said Mrs. Langdon ; Natalie thought that perhapsshe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Dear , I understand that people only . . . " ) " How do you like it here ? " Mrs. Langdon asked . It was , of course , not the first time Natalie had been asked ; she laughed with embarrassment and then , changing her mind for some reason in midstream , said uncomfortably , " I do n't know yet . I mean , I have so much yet to learn . " " Like not running around corners ? " said Mrs. Langdon , and paused , smiling , in their walk . " This is where we live , " she said . " It 's a faculty house  --  observe the architecture , done by a fellow faculty member , since deceased , observe the college stonework and the handy-man air about the drainpipes . Students , " she added soberly , " are to feel free to call upon faculty members for assistance and advice , although it is recommended that they do not visit a faculty home without specific invitations having been issued . " She smiled again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to that sort of thing , " Mrs. Langdon said . " Wo n't you come in ? " " Thank you , " Natalie said ; could it be true that she was so casually invited into Arthur Langdon 's house ? As the door closed behind them Natalie hesitated in the small hallway ; the fact that this was certainly the housep99where Arthur Langdon lived seemed somehow to color the air of it , and was that not a trace of his pipe smoke ? It could be that as Natalie stood in the hallway her feet were set precisely in Arthur Langdon 's footprints . It was undeniable , also , that he had at some time touched this doorknob . Elizabeth Langdon , her own door closed behind her , had changed , as a bird stepping again inside its cage is no longer a creature of circle and parabola , but a hopping thing ; Elizabeth pushed off her hat and slipped her coat from her shoulders and , preceding Natalie into a light living room , dropped her hat and coat on a couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a gesture . Seemingly she had accepted Natalie inside her house as a person , something more than the mere student Natalie had been outside the house . Natalie saw dimly , as she fumbled with the buttons of her coat , a succession of meetings with Elizabeth Langdonoutside her house , of formal questions after one 's health and dutiful laughter , of civility and disinterest and courtesy , of Elizabeth Langdon denying politely anything she might ever have said inside . " It 's so nice here , " Natalie said . Although she had already glanced quickly around the room ( wondering , as she did so , with a fast secret look at Elizabeth Langdon , What is it in here she finds so alarming ? Will I be happy here ? Will I ever know these things well ? ) , she made now a great performance of looking around , letting her eyes stop suitably long at the Hayter etching over the mantel , taking in gratefullythe blended colors of the slipcovers , the curtains , the rug . There were books , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the proportion of bright jackets to dull bindings ) and found them dubiousp100too much yellow and red , too little calf . It occurred to her that she would probably like the Langdons very much , while privately deploring Elizabeth a little . " I can offer you a drink , you know , " Elizabeth Langdon said ; she had been busied hanging up their coats and now backed out of the closet , her hair rumpled . " Would you like a cocktail ? Martini ? " Natalie realized how very indelicate this all was . She had been in college not more than a month , and this woman had certainly no business offering her cocktails , or even speaking to her so . " Thank you very much , " said Natalie , thinking , She must be terribly lonely . Her problem was illustrated directly with the question of sitting down : as a student , she should certainly not seat herself while a faculty wife stood ; as a guest , she certainly could . The only solution was to lift the whole situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie , with dogged informality , followed Elizabeth into the small kitchen . " May I help you ? " Natalie asked . " Nothing to do , " said Elizabeth , her head now buried in the refrigerator . " Arthur keeps a pitcher of martinis already made . I ca n't make them , " she added , drawing out her head , " and he 's always too tired when he comes back from class . Olive ? " " Thank you . " " God damn , " said Elizabeth . She leaned back , trying to see the top shelf of the pantry . " No more , " she said , and turned and laughed at Natalie . " We 've got to have our martinisin fruit juice glasses . There 's only one cocktail glass I have n't broken and of course I have to give that to Arthur . " Natalie , who was not really completely certain of thep101difference between a cocktail glass and a fruit juice glass , spared a moment to wonder about the oddness of saving the last glass for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me dry the glasses at home because I always drop them . " Why did I say that ? she wondered again , it is n't true . Now I 'll just have to remember it so I wo n't tell her in a few minutes that I never break anything . They took their cocktails into the living room again , walkingcautiously and not speaking . Then , when Natalie had lowered herself tentatively into an overstuffed armchair , with her cocktail correctly on a coaster and a cigarette offered and declined ( Natalie was afraid to smoke until she had solved the problem of who was going to light whose cigarette ; it was difficult for Natalie to get up from the overstuffed chair and walk across to Elizabeth with a match , but it was unthinkable that Elizabeth should stand up from the couch and walk across to Natalie with a match . It occurred to Natalie that she could light a cigaretteafter Elizabeth was well started on hers , taking one from her pocket with an absent-minded air , as one who smokes without thinking , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long while she talked ) , Elizabeth leaned back on the couch , looking at Natalie smilingly , and said , with an air of having all the time in the world to get to more important subjects , " So you 're one of my husband'sstudents ? " " I believe I am , " Natalie said cautiously  --  best not to appeartoo anxious . " Do you like it here ? " Elizabeth asked . It was still not a question Natalie was entirely equipped to answer . She decided finally that the least she could dop102was reply again to this determined friendliness in an open manner , and so she looked at Elizabeth and smiled and shrugged . " I do n't really think I like it very much yet , " she said . " No one seems to pay much attention to anyone else . " Elizabeth nodded , choosing to take this statement as one of fact . " That 's true , " she said . " You 'll find as you go on that they 'll pay less and less attention to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because everyone here is so much interested in themselves and their own concerns , and no one cares about anyone else or education or teaching the young or helping anyone else , but all they care about is getting as much as they can as fast as they can . " What did I start ? Natalie thought . " I suppose that 's a good description of education , " she said , feeling her way . " Except that even if you learn that much , it 's something . " This was lost on Elizabeth ; she was staring into her cocktail glass , her long fair hair falling softly down on either side of her face , her eyes intent . When she looked up suddenly , as Natalie finished speaking , she smiled and said , " I suppose I 'm more bitter because I used to be a student and now I 'm a faculty wife . " " I should think that would just give you twice as many friends , " Natalie said , wondering if it was friends they were talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion would spill her drink and then saw that Elizabeth 's glass was empty . Hastily Natalie took up her own glass and sipped . " It means I have almost no friends , " Elizabeth said , now watching Natalie drink . " You ca n't , you know . I mean , girls I used to know as students are in their lastp103year now , and it 's very hard for me to talk to them . And of course all the other faculty wives are too old for me . " " You did n't finish college before you married ? " asked Natalie with interest ; here was an achievement to be envied . Elizabeth shook her long hair again . " I never wanted to come in the first place , " she said . " I 'm only about three years older than you are . " And yet she can sit here and serve cocktails , Natalie thought . " I 'm seventeen , " she said . " You see ? " said Elizabeth . " I was twenty-one my last birthday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Natalie thought . " I think you 're terribly pretty , " she said , shocking herself deeply by this statement , which was not in her usual repertoire . Elizabeth smiled again , her smile this time deepening with pleasure , her eyes shining . " I think that 's nice of you , " she said . " Another cocktail ? " Natalie looked at her half-finished glass . " I 'm very slow , " she said . " I 'll wait for you , " said Elizabeth , turning her glass in her fingers . She was so obviously planning just to wait , not doing anything else , that Natalie quickly drank down the last of her cocktail , catching the olive in her mouth and holding out her glass with her mouth still full . When Elizabeth came back with the drinks , she said , " Try to keep up with me , " as she set Natalie 's glass down on the table . " Yes , " she went on , taking up her conversation wherep104she had left it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my English teacher . " She sat down on the couch and regarded Natalie gloomily . " Sometimes I could cry , " she said . Natalie , who was unused to drinking at best , and certainlyunused to two fast cocktails after a confusing afternoon , was beginning to feel delightfully at home , and friendly , and strong , and sympathetic . She could see clearly by now that Elizabeth was a wonderfully beautiful woman ; it no longer seemed strange that a student in college should marry , but only strange that any unhappiness should approach this perfect creature . " I wish I could help you , " Natalie said . She was almost certain that there were tears in her eyes . " Be my friend , " said Elizabeth . She looked at Natalie earnestly . " Be my friend , " she said . " Do n't ever tell any-one . " " Do n't ever tell anyone what ? " Elizabeth , who had risen at that moment with her empty glass in her hand , stopped , turning slightly toward the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room they could hear voices from outside , calling to one another and laughing . After a minute Elizabeth relaxed , and made a perfunctorymovement toward Natalie 's glass . " No , " said Natalie , " oh , no , thank you . " Without comment Elizabeth turned and went to the kitchen , and came back in a moment with her full glass . " Do n't ever tell anyone , " she said . " No one thinks I 'm unhappy , no one even dreams I 'm unhappy , and you know once you let them know you 're unhappy then they start wondering why , and then they look at you and they think you 're get/ting old or something . They were all so jealous anyway . I 'm still as pretty as I ever was . " She turned her head proudly on her neck , and Natalie , feeling herself more than ever thin and unformed , nodded admiringly . " You see , " Elizabeth went on , spreading her empty hands in front of her and looking at the fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty wives and all the faculty wives think I 'm friends with the students or with the other faculty wives and all the other faculty wives think I 'm friends with the other faculty wives and all the other  --  " She stopped , her eyes wide . There was a definite step outside the door , then it opened and Arthur Langdon came in . He was handsome and tired , and looked , in his worn sports jacket with the elbows patched in chamois ; rather as though his mental picture of himself was somewhat more refined than the actual sight of him to others . When he came in through the door his eyes took in , swiftly , his wife , Natalie , and their empty cocktail glasses . Without speakinghe set his brief case down just inside the door , and came slowly into the room . After one quick , inclusive glance again at Natalie , he regarded his wife . " My dear , " he said cordially , and smiled over his shoulderat Natalie . " I only had one , " Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only had one . " " Of course you did , " he said to her , and turned and smiled largely at Natalie . " My wife seems to be reluctant to introduce us , " he said . " I 'm Arthur Langdon . " Who did he think I thought he was ? Natalie wondered . " I 'm Natalie Waite , " she said , and , to establish her position immediately ( so that he might throw her outp106if he chose ? ) , she added , " I 'm in your freshman English class . " " I thought you were , " he said . " Think I could join you in one of those ? " He took Natalie 's nearly empty glass from her , passed his wife without apparently seeing her glass , and went into the kitchen . After a minute he came back , looked once at his wife , and handed Natalie her full glass . " Here 's luck , " he said , and he and Natalie drank , Natalie very cautiously , and noting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " he said , and sat down on a chair near Natalie , " what do you think of it here ? " " I like it very much , " Natalie said . " It 's a little strange still , of course . " " It will be strange for quite a while , " he said . " It 's taken me four years to get used to it , I know . " " I 've been enjoying your class , " Natalie said , thinking , My father taught me to be more intelligent than this ; but Arthur Langdon perplexed her . He was subtly familiar to her , as though his words were meaningful on more than one level , as though there were an established communicatonbetween them in the course of five minutes , as though , actually , he were clearly aware that she could talk more intelligently than this , and was waiting indulgently for the strangeness of the environment to wear off before any conversation began . I wonder if he makes everyone feel like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might feel led her to say , stumbling , " You reminded me of my father this morning in class . " He smiled . " All first-year students find sooner or later that some professor reminds them of their fathers . "  | " Now you remind me of him again , " Natalie said . " He talks like that . " Arthur Langdon raised his eyebrows incredulously . " He 's a writer , " Natalie said weakly ; it crossed her mind that she would not have so much trouble bringing out the words if her father had been a plumber , or even a policeman ; unless he asks me who my father is , she thought , I will have to come right out and tell him and then suppose he does n't know who I 'm talking about and what can I say ? " Arnold Waite , " she said . " Really ? " Arthur Langdon nodded ; for a minute Natalie was sure that he had never heard of her father and that she might  --  with discomfort , with confusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Langdon noddedagain and said , " Like to meet him sometime . " " I hope you will , " Natalie said politely . Elizabeth Langdon , who had been leaning forward with her long hair falling about her face and her empty glass cupped in both hands , staring brightly from her husband to Natalie as each one spoke , now said with an appearance of alert interest , " Is n't he the writer ? " Her husband and Natalie both looked at her silently . " I mean , " she said , moving her glass in illustration , " is n't he Arnold Waite , the writer ? " " I suppose so , " said Natalie lamely , " although he 's only really written one book . " " I was sure he was a writer , " said Elizabeth Langdon with satisfaction . " You remember , " she said nudgingly to her husband , " you gave me some article of his to read in some magazine , and I read it and I thought it was very good . "  |p108Arthur  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father comes to see you we 'll be able to get together . And when you write him , " he added with a modest laugh , " tell him I 'm using some of his stuff in my advanced classes . " " I certainly will , " said Natalie thankfully . " By the way , " said Arthur Langdon , turning directly to his wife to show that he was speaking to her , " a couple of the girls are going to drop over sometime before din-ner . " There was a short silence . And then , " Who ? " asked Elizabeth Langdon . " A couple of my students , " said Arthur Langdon . " It must be almost five , " said Natalie quickly . " I 'd better be getting back . " She rose , and Arthur Langdon said , " Do n't go , unless you really have something important to do . You might enjoy meeting these girls . " " Well , " said Natalie hesitantly , not knowing to what extentthese people might be trusted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . " I would like to stay , " she said , reverting to her never-never land of no precedents . " Please stay , " said Elizabeth Langdon . This , at any rate , could not be insincere . Natalie smiled shyly and sat down again . Once she had definitely indicated her continuing presence Arthur Langdon seemed to feel free to speak to his wife , as though Natalie were now enough a member of the familynot to hear anything he said . Her seniority as guest allowedthem to talk of the new guests expected , and even to hope , perhaps , that Natalie might share in their arrangements for entertainment , perhaps carrying glasses , or emp/tying ashtrays , or simply preparing herself with a stock of small talk to be used directly they entered . " They wo n't drink any more than two cocktails apiece , " said Arthur Langdon to his wife . " Do you have any pretzels or anything ? " " What 's all the fuss over them ? " Elizabeth asked , not moving . " I like things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he said . " It looks all right to them if they get a free drink and a few words of wisdom from you , " Elizabeth said . " Nevertheless , " he said emphatically , " I want my studentstreated as well as possible . " Elizabeth addressed Natalie , " You and I do n't need anythingfancy , do we ? Pretzels ? Imported caviar ? Breast of guinea hen ? " Natalie opened her mouth to speak , Arthur Langdon opened his mouth to speak , and the doorbell rang . " I 'll get it , " Arthur said quickly . His wife watched him without expression as he hurried to the door . " Ca n't wait , can he ? " she said unpleasantly to Natalie . Natalie , uncomfortable and wishing she had left , and yet at the same time enjoying immensely a series of events which she could watch without being really implicated , stood up uncertainly as Arthur opened the door . " Can I get the pretzels or anything for you ? " she asked Elizabeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Watch little Arthur be the little host . " Arthur came back into the room , followed by two girls . Natalie , looking at them with a frank stare possible onlyp110because they were both looking at Arthur and for the momentignoring both herself and Elizabeth , saw with the irritationshe was beginning to know as jealousy that they were both lovely , in the way that Elizabeth Langdon was lovely : the rounded , colorful , rich beauty of girls who have been pretty babies and pretty little girls and pretty boardingschool girls and who have , at last , in college , reached a fulfillment of prettiness because they are finally nubile ; that their loveliness would be deadened as Elizabeth 's had been deadened was not more than a small consolation to Natalie ; that this loveliness built and recharged itself with an awareness of loveliness , and almost certainly masked vacant stupidity , was no consolation at all . The further thought that , premising the loveliness of young women as nature 's infallible way of insuring them husbands , these two could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the world , was less than no consolation at all . Vicki , one of them was named , and the other was Anne . Vicki had great , long-lashed dark eyes which she disguised , as though it were a joke between herself and the beholder , with heavy-rimmed glasses ; these glasses , to enhancethe joke , she played with constantly , taking them off and putting them on with a mock-efficient gesture , using them to wave with , to hold in her hands , but very rarely keeping them over her face . With or without the glasses , she gave an additional impression of seeing clearly everythingthat went on around her , and of enjoying it without pity . Anne  --  had these girls become friends on purpose ?  --  was sweet and subdued ; like something out of Little Women , Natalie thought with scorn , thinking almost at the samep111minute that she would not be wise to underestimate Anne , who smiled shyly and almost curtseyed , who looked sweetly at Natalie and at Elizabeth and at Vicki and at Arthur Langdon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone should be so kind to shy Anne ; who would never , it was perfectly clear , give away an inch of anything she had once gotten hold of . " How do you do , Mrs. Langdon ? " said Anne softly to Elizabeth . " How are you ? " " Very well , thank you , Anne , " Elizabeth said , not moving from the couch . " Mrs. Langdon , " said Vicki , coming over to Elizabeth with her hand out , " it 's been so long since we 've seen you . " Are these old friends of hers ? Natalie wondered ; perhaps some of the girls she knew as students ? She turned as she heard her name . " Natalie Waite , " Arthur was saying . " How do you do ? " said Natalie politely , and felt for a long minute the two pair of eyes regarding her , disdainingher perhaps , estimating her . " I think I 've seen you in the dining room or somewhere , " Vicki said , as one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her general inheritance , but rarely visited , perhaps because of its barrenness , or the provincial nature of its inhabitants . " You 're new , are n't you ? " added Anne . And that , Natalie thought , is the extent of my impact upon the college so far ; she signified that she was very new indeed , and somehow managed , unwillingly , to imply that she was now in the presence of the first four people she had spoken to as formal acquaintances since she had reached the college . All four of them smiled upon her , forp112the only time united , in their mutual superiority at having been in this place longer than Natalie had . Perhaps , too , at that moment , something vague solidified within Natalie , in the face of the three lovely girls in the room , so that she became less of a meek and submissive personality and was without warning as good a soul as the rest of them ; from within the strongholds of her own possessive pride in herselfit became now apparent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She might , she thought in this minute , choose to pursue an acquaintance with these two girls ; it was obvious that both Elizabeth and ArthurLangdon had perceived that , of the vast unidentified face of the new student body , Natalie had become an individual , with a father , and recognizable . Was it  --  and again this thought had never in these words troubled Natalie before  --  worthwhilebothering with any of them ? At any rate , acquaintances or not , it was first necessary for all of them to find a place to sit down , and for Arthur to get everyone drinks , and for Elizabeth , never moving from the couch , where she was now half-reclining , to say some few words , somehow  --  as it seemed  --  managing to choke out the barest civilities , in a manner both indifferent and insulting . Natalie looked into her glass with embarrassment , not so much for Elizabeth as for the fact that she had suddenly discovered that in the confusion attending the entrance of Vicki and Anne , she had consumed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the new one Arthur handed to her , four strong cocktails for Natalie . She wondered , and thought she had wondered before , that this intoxicant should he liquid , why was it that a substance so indulged in should not be a solid , like candy , or a smoke , .  |p113like  tobacco , or even merely a scent ? the oddness of having to drink alcohol ( surely she could not have consumed so much water in the late afternoon ) perplexed Natalie , and she wanted to speak of this unique perspective but could not find phrases ; then she became aware that Arthur Langdonwas speaking. "  --  And so I thought that we might work from that angle for a while . You ought to read that book , " he was telling Anne . Anne looked at him for a long minute before answering ; it had the double effect of keeping everyone 's eyes fixed on her while they waited for her to speak , and of convincing everyone , apparently , that she was serious , and timid about voicing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did speak it would be with a slight , charming lisp . Natalie unwisely thought that this method must be ineffectivewith anyone of sense , after the first time . " Will you lend it to me ? " Anne asked Arthur finally . What a fool she is , Natalie thought , and looked at Elizabethto see if Elizabeth too thought that Anne was a fool , but Elizabeth was staring again at her own hands and her empty glass . " How do you like it here ? " Vicki asked Natalie . " Still pretty strange ? " " Not at all , " Natalie said politely . " Everyone has been so kind . " " Anne and I live on the floor below you , " Vicki said . " Did you know it ? " " In the same house ? " Natalie said , surprised . " The same house , " Vicki agreed , making it sound like a bordello . " They always put a few reliable upperclassmen inp114with the new students . To make them feel at home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen you , " Natalie said . " We were in your room the other day while you were out , " Vicki said carelessly . Natalie stared at her and she laughed . " We knew you would n't mind , " she said . " We were curious about you because you looked more interestingthan most . There 's a red-headed character  --  " She shudderedtheatrically . " Anyway , we thought we 'd find out what you were like , so we wandered in one day when we knew you were out . " Anne had given over her conversation with Arthur to listen to Vicki , and now she laughed prettily . " We practically sneaked in , " she told Natalie . " Ca n't trust this pair , " Arthur Langdon added with something that might have been pride . " They 'll do anything . " " I do n't understand , " Natalie said uncertainly , meaning that she did not understand her own feelings at the moment ; the thought of anyone , and particularly these two girls , comingunbidden into her room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to think nothing of it , but looked at her now with calm , guiltless , amused eyes ; they premised their visit on what must be a complimentary opinion of Natalie , they criticized the red-haired girl , and they had Arthur Langdon 's blessing upon them , although Elizabeth looked at them now with incurious contempt . She shook her head ; should she accept this and gamble upon the value these two girls might possibly hold for her ; should she show anger and demonstrate to Arthur Langdon that she was not to be tampered with , that even Vicki and Anne might not tangle safely with Natalie Waite ?  |p115Elizabeth  was at best a dubious ally , Natalie 's journal was always locked and the key always with her , she had as yet incriminated herself in no way with her room . She smiled quickly and said , " But how did you get in ? I always lock the door . " Anne and Vicki laughed , and even Arthur laughed with them . Then Anne said very meekly , " All the corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is 27 , so the keys to 17 and 37 and 7 all unlock it . " " Did n't you ever know we 'd been there ? " Vicki asked Natalie . " We sat on your bed and read some of your books . " And my letters , Natalie thought , and judged my clothes and commented on the dirty laundry under the bed and opened my dresser drawers and observed the view from my window and tried my lipstick and sampled my perfume and tested . . . " And what did you find out about me ? " she asked . " I thought , " said Anne in her innocence , " that you must be an awfully interesting person to know . " She just avoided saying " awf'ly int'resting . " " All those books , " she added . " Except for your bedspread , " Vicki said impolitely . " Who did pick that out ? " She edged the remark over into a faint compliment by hesitating just long enough , and then saying , " Not you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedspread until it was worn to shreds , Natalie said , " My mother . She also chooses my clothes . " She hoped she had implied that she was too mad a , creature to concern herself with clothes and bedspreads , perhaps even the despair of her mother 's heart for her giddy impracticality . " My father chooses my books , " she told Arthur Langdon , and he nodded , impressed.  | " Do n't you make up your own mind about anything ? " Anne asked sweetly . " My mother , " Vicki said ruefully , " does n't care what I wear . Once just to prove it I put on black nail polish  --  this was when I was about fifteen , " she added hastily , lookingfrom Natalie to Arthur Langdon , "  --  and when I came to the dinner table and waved my hands around frantically trying to make her notice , she finally said to me , Victoria dear , I wish you 'd eat more vegetables ; you seem so nervous . ' " Natalie laughed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was determined to make the knowledge of her these girls had acquired legitimate ; she thought , I will have to see the bedspreads in their rooms before I can sleep privately in mine again . " Another drink ? " said Arthur Langdon . He made a large gesture with his hand of sweeping all the glasses together . " Thank you so much , " said Anne , and Vicki held out her glass with a smile . Natalie discovered with horror that she had finished another drink , but her small protest was overwhelmedby Arthur Langdon . As before , he passed his wife without offering to take her empty glass , and Vicki and Anne glanced at each other , and then , bewilderingly , at Natalie , and they all smiled . " Did you have a pleasant summer ? " Elizabeth asked abruptly . Anne shrugged perfectly , and Vicki said , " About the same as usual , I guess . Sort of dull . " " You were together , of course ? " said Elizabeth , this time addressing Anne , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other.  | " Of course , " Anne said , and laughed deprecatingly . " I guess we always are , " she said . " We were on the island , most of the time , " Vicki said . " This island , " Elizabeth said deliberately to Natalie , it being perhaps Natalie 's turn to be spoken to , " about which Vicki is so modest , is a little hideout of approximately four hundred square miles that belongs to Vicki 's family . It 's named something like Bide-A-Wee or Dew Drop Inn or Joe 's Place . " " Shangri-La , " said Vicki coolly . " I did n't name it . " " It 's lovely there , though ; so private , " Anne said , looking at the wall between Elizabeth and Natalie . Elizabeth said to Natalie , as though wanting this clearly defined , as though it were necessary now to emphasize these facts , " Anne 's mother , by the way , designs evening gowns neither you nor I can afford . " First of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford . . . ? and then she understood that she was an as yet untried but possibly very strong ally , and if Elizabeth could use a heavy social parody to set Anne and Vicki into a different world and locate her sensitive , impoverished army securely behind their pride . . . thinking this far , Natalie thought , She must know I hate their going into my room , and said , " My mother chooses my evening gowns . " Evening gowns , she thought , evening gowns for Natalie Waite , that debutante . " My brother sells insurance in New Jersey , " Elizabeth said , playing it just a shade too heavy . Natalie laughed , and Vicki and Anne turned to look at her together , speculatively.  | " She 's making fun of us , you know , " Anne said to Natalie . In my own country I was accounted quite a killer , Nataliethought ; next time she 'll stay where she belongs . " I 'm sure she must be , " Natalie said sweetly . Elizabeth leaned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . Natalie and Vicki and Anne watched her silently , and then Elizabeth lifted her head and looked at Anne . She is sure I 'm with her , Natalie thought ; what is she going to do ? " You still chasing after my husband ? " Elizabeth said suddenly to Anne . " Doing any better this year ? " " Everybody about given me up ? " Arthur Langdon came back into the room carrying a tray on which were four full glasses and a bowl of pretzels . As he set the tray down upon the coffee table and began handing around the glasses , he said , " Sorry to keep you all waiting . I had to mix more cocktails . " He looked for a long minute at his wife , who stared back solemnly at him . " They were all gone , " Arthur said . " Pretzel ? " he added politely to Anne . " Dear , " said Elizabeth softly , " Anne and Vicki have just been telling us all about what they did this summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really ? " Arthur said to Vicki ; his voice was faintly wistful . " The usual thing , " Vicki said , and Elizabeth laughed loudly . Natalie was now far too happy to think of leaving . She thought she would like to be in Vicki 's place , perhaps , in this scene , or even in Anne 's ; her feeling of pity for Elizabeth ,  |p119which  had been momentary at best , was now a sort of curiouswonder ; what further could this madwoman do ? How could she expose herself as so weak before these two girls , before Natalie , whom she knew so slightly ? " Tell me about your father , " Arthur Langdon said to Natalie . Natalie retraced his thought ( Vicki 's family , money , fame , Natalie 's father ) and said , " I 'm sure he 'd love to meet you . I 'll have to write him all about you , you know . " He looked at her inquiringly , and she said , " I write him almost everything that happens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not throw him a fish ? " all about any interestingpeople I meet . " She smiled with an excellent imitation of Anne 's shy smile . " He 's certainly an interesting person , " Anne said immediately . " Your father will  --  " Vicki began . " Interesting like a potato bug , " Elizabeth said from the couch . We are all a little drunk , Natalie told herself wisely . When the phone rang it was perfectly clear to everyone in the room that Elizabeth was not going to attempt gettingoff the couch to answer it , and everyone except Arthur Langdon waited tensely for him to leave the room again . As his voice came distantly from another room saying , " Hello ? " Vicki said quickly to Elizabeth , " I do n't think you ought to talk to Anne the way you did , Mrs. Langdon . After all , Anne has never  --  " " I 'll bet Anne has n't never , " Elizabeth said . Vicki gestured helplessly at Natalie . " These women alwayssuspect  --  " she said directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , " sympatheti/cally , but decided not to . Further irony would not materiallyimprove this situation , and she was still not irrevocablycommitted to Elizabeth . " Suppose you come to my office , " Arthur Langdon said from the other room . Anne glanced briefly at the door beyond which Arthur was somewhere talking into the phone , and said with just the right amount of confused indignation , " After all , Mrs. Langdon , Arthur and I are only  --  " " Mr. Langdon , " said Elizabeth . " Mr. Langdon , " said Anne obediently . " We 're only studyingtogether . I mean , since I 'm one of his students it 's only natural that we should  --  " She hesitated admirably .  --  study together , " she said . " And remember , " Vicki said , " you were one of his studentsonce , Mrs. Langdon . You must remember what an interest he takes in  --  " " Goodbye , " Arthur Langdon said from the other room , and everyone was silent and did not speak again until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and said to Natalie , " You were telling me about your father . " " We must go , " Vicki said . Anne nodded , and rose . Natalie , who had opened her mouth to speak of her father , closed her mouth again and started uncertainly to get out of her chair . Vicki looked at her . " Come along with us , " she said finally . " We can go to dinner together , " Anne said . " I 'd love to , " Natalie said , thinking , I 'm not an ally , I 'm a mercenary . " Thanks very much , " she said to Elizabeth , and to Arthur , " I 've enjoyed myself immensely . "  | " Come in any time , " Arthur Langdon said , seeming actually to mean it . " It was terribly nice of you to have us , " Vicki said to Elizabeth . She did not go over to the couch to say it , but stood near the door , as though she realized perfectly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let Elizabeth reach her . " Perhaps you 'll be able to come over for a drink with us some day soon ? " " Thanks , " Elizabeth said . " Mrs. Langdon , " Anne said . " Thank you very much . " She and Vicki turned to the door , with Natalie following , and Anne said to Arthur , intimately but somehow very clearly , " Arthur , it was so nice . " Arthur Langdon looked nervously at his wife , and said , " I hope you 'll come again soon . " " We 'd love to , " Vicki said . They got out the door , the three of them , with Arthur Langdon waving to them as they started down the path . When he had finally closed the door behind them , Vicki laughed , and then was quiet for a minute , she and Anne walking on either side of Natalie and both of them , Natalie felt , observing her and amused . Then Vicki said finally , as though to no one in particular , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm not sure , " Natalie said . Should she carry tales ? " Three or four drinks . " " Someone ought to slap her pretty face for her , " Vicki said . " I wish Arthur had guts enough to do it . " Anne stuffed her hands into the pockets of her jacket and did a little dance step along the path . " I wish I could be there now , " she said , " to hear them fight . "  |p122October  2 Natalie , my child , No , indeed , I do not read Shakespeare any more ; I have passed the age when such things are felt to be essential , and have reached the age when half a dozen esoteric quotationsare all I ever need  --  those , that is , and a Concordancefor any unexpected crisis . I feel very strongly the pull of the middle-aged personality , when a ball game and the evening paper are the food of love . Which reminds me that your mother has had a cold and I must ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , a rather usual one ) I must trouble you , I say , once more for congratulations . Some odd little magazine has done me an odd little honor  --  my own modest way of rephrasing a particular requestfrom them for a series of articles , so you may , if your mother permits , have a new coat this winter . I admire your Mr. Langdon . Arthur Langdon , did you say ? His name is familiar ; ask him if he has ever published . I seem to recollect a series of poems in an arty journal , but perhaps , now that he is an associate professor , he would prefer to forget them ? You do not say much about Mrs. Langdon , except that she used to be one of his students  --  is that the only unusual fact about her ? Walk not in the sun , my Natalie , nor reproach your father hereafter for his unlearning . Forgive also the fact that this letter is so short . I am taking time from my writing to keep in touch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very bright center in my life . I sent you to college to enjoy yourself , not to get an education , but , my dear , please hereafter do try not to split infinitives . ( " To enthusiastically admire Mr. Langdon " indeed ! We neither of us thank you ! )  |p123Your  mother insists that I inquire about your health . I tell her that it is no longer our affair , but she feels that maternal interest is evidenced by a scrupulous investigation of your internal workings . Do you have any trouble with your eyes , she wants to know ? Your chest ? Your feet ? Be sure , she says , to keep handy a bottle of cough medicine in the event of that nasty cough you used to have at night .. . when you were three . Love , DadSomewhere in the world trees were growing , Natalie thought as she walked down the hall of the house where she now lived ; her feet on the linoleum floor made a flat sound , as of one walking upon dead earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and her father , glancing from his study window  --  perhaps her father thought , I wish Natalie were here . On either side of Natalieas she walked toward her own room were doors : perhapsbehind one door a girl was studying , behind another a girl was crying , behind a third a girl was turning uneasily in her sleep . Behind a certain definite door downstairs Anne and Vicki sat , laughing and speaking in loud voices whatever they chose to say ; behind other doors girls lifted their heads at Natalie 's footsteps , turned , wondered , and went back to their work . I wish I were the only person in all the world , Natalie thought , with a poignant longing , thinking then that perhaps she was , after all . She reached her own door , and wondered again  --  Is this possible , my own door ? Can it be that after so short a time I can recognizeone door among many , and call it " my own " ? Or isp124it only from here , in the hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only go out one door from my room ; it 's coming in that is so confusing . Inside , her room was expectant and without interest in her , as though her final decision upon one door was a matter of small concern to the room itself , and she might as well have walked into limbo , or into a well of fire , for all the room cared . The book she had put down over an hour ago had not consumed any more of its own pages , the typewriter had not turned out any literature , the window had not seen any interesting sights since she left . She dropped her books tiredly on the bed and went with method to hang her jacket in the closet before she sat clown at the desk . A vague ambition touched her briefly : should she put a sheet of paper into the typewriter , and perhaps even write on it ? Should she read , dress , eat her mother 's cookies , sleep ? She was staring uncertainly at the window ( she might jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Come in , " she said , thinking as always , Was it really my door they wanted ? It was Rosalind , which made it certainly Natalie 's door , above all others , that she wanted . " Listen , " Rosalind said without greeting as she came through the door and half-closed it softly behind her , " listen , Nat , want to see something ? " " What ? " " Come on , then , " Rosalind said urgently . " Come on . " Natalie rose and followed Rosalind through the door again , and back down the hall . They reached a door halfwaydown toward the stairway  --  it belonged to someone Natalie knew vaguely ; perhaps the girl with bangs whose124name might have been Winnie Williams or a girl they called Sandy  --  and Rosalind stopped in front of the door and said very softly , " Wait , I 'll open it , then you 'll see . " " Listen  --  " Natalie began . Finger on her lips , Rosalind took hold of the doorknob and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She craned her head around and said , " Look , look . " Natalie , embarrassed , looked over her shoulder , phrasing apologies ( " Sorry , thought it was the john " ) in her mind , but there was no one inside . " They 've gone , " Rosalind said , disappointed . " You should have seen them . " " Who ? " Rosalind laughed , and shrugged . " Next time , " she said . " See you later . " She went off down the hall and Natalie , going the other way , went back to her own room . It was that night that the talk of theft was first openly in evidence . In the basement room where the girls played bridge , where there was a stone floor and one dismal ashtrayand a broken couch , and where Natalie sat cautiously in a corner , hoping that someone would notice her , and comment , perhaps , on her professional manner of smoking , the girls gathered noisily , the two or three who always heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Honestly , " Peggy Spencer said honestly , " I would n't have said a word unless I knew . They are really going to search everybody . " " Me ? " said Natalie , raising her voice for the first time in that room.  | " Honestly , " Peggy Spencer said , addressing herself for the first time to Natalie across the room . " See , there 's been so much stuff missing . . . Natalie did not know . Because she did not , had not heard , she found that all at once everyone was talking to her as though they knew her , even though one girl did persistently call her Helen and another thought that she lived on the fourth floor ( it was here a comfort of sorts to Natalie to know that she had not been so universally observedas she thought ) , they all spoke directly to her . " I lost this evening dress , " one said , her voice riding over the others . " That was really the first . You see , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress was hanging . . . " " Someone on the second floor lost forty dollars , " said someone else . " It 's been going on for ages , " Peggy Spencer said . " Everyone'sbeen missing things for about a month , and no one said anything because . . . " She hesitated , searching for a reason why no one had said anything . " Anyway , " she went on , " it finally got so bad that Old Nick heard about it , and then of course when she started asking questions .. Peggy shrugged . " Why , then , " she said , " it turned out that nearly everyone had lost something or other . I do n't think , " she added thoughtfully , turning her red head around to look at everyone in the room , " I do n't really think that all those things were really stolen . " " My dress is gone  --  I know I did n't send it to the cleanersthat day because I remember thinking especially  --  "  --  and this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and imagine a pair of shoes . Who could wear anyone else 's shoes ? "  |  --  and lots of money . There was this girl lost forty dollars , and lots of other people had money that just  --  "  --  and someone said a girl on the first floor lost some lettersand a lot of jewelry . " " A slip , too . Real lace . " Natalie , smoking professionally , was checking desperatelyover her belongings ; if she had lost any clothes or jewelry she would hardly have known it , since she had worn the same sweater and skirt for a week , and except for the formality of hanging her jacket on the hook just inside her closet door had not opened her closet since she took out the skirt she was now wearing , but the persistent thoughts rode her mind side by side : first , it would not look well if she had not lost anything , and , second , was she not an obvious thief ? She felt her cheek reddening , and turned her head down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stolen anything , she thought ( And had she perhaps not ? She was suddenly aware of the excitement of going silently into someone 's room , looking smilingly over someoneelse 's possessions , reading letters , scrutinizing pictures , fondling jewelry , discarding whatever did not meet her fancy , and then  --  the most dangerous part ; up until this moment her carefully planned excuses would let her off  --  slippingthe roll of bills into her pocket , stuffing the book into the front of her sweater , flinging the real lace over her arm as though it belonged to her , and coming softly out of someone else 's room , closing the door gently , walking boldly down the hall , counting over her new dear ownings behind the tightly locked door of her own room ) , and she thought that all of them were looking at her , unexpectedly quiet , all thinking at once , Why , it was that girl , of course ;  |p128I  remember now , I saw her coming out of my room , I always said she was .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie directly . In the small brief silence Natalie said , thinking , " Only some change that I left on my dresser . I put it there when I came in and then I went to take a shower and when I came back it was gone . " All the faces were turned to her now . " I did n't want to say anything , " she explained , " becausethen I did n't know that anything else was missing and I did n't want to make any trouble for anyone . " " That 's the way we all felt , " someone said approvingly . " And yet , " Peggy Spencer said earnestly , " if no one ever said anything , whoever it is would just be getting away with it all the time . " " That 's true , " Natalie said . " I mean , now that I know about it , I feel differently about it . " Why am I talking , she wondered in shame ; who am I convicting , whose soul am I selling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I here , she thought sadly , pretending that someone else has stolen from me ? After the special trip Natalie had made back to her room to freshen her lipstick and comb her hair , it seemed almost callous of Arthur Langdon not to turn and smile at her when she stood timidly in the doorway of his office , not daring to knock for fear he had already seen her , not daring to enter for fear he had not already seen her ; she thought of trying a slight cough , or of saying softly , " Mr. Langdon ? " or of going away a step and walking heavily up to the door again , but all these devices were of course only endlessp129vicious circles around the central point , which was that for some reason Mr. Almighty Langdon thought he need not , if he chose not , notice Miss Natalie Waite , and really thought he could keep her waiting uncertainly , endlessly , in the doorway to his office . As she was wondering , then , if a sort of dignified march back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than this , he looked up at her , blankly for a minute , as one who thinks deeply , and then recognized her with a nod of companionship that said she was to enter but not speak . She moved respectfully into the room , thinking that she was the kind of woman who knows when to keep quiet , and sat docilely in the chair beside the desk , her hands folded , and her eyes discreetlyturned away from him , to show that she was not in the least interested in what he was doing . She could see , however , from the corners of her eyes , that he looked tired as he bent his head over the papers on the desk ; he 's been fighting with Elizabeth , she thought with new knowledge , and hoped he would notice her quiet sympathy . " I wish I were an insurance salesman , " he said abruptly , shoving the papers back on his desk . Natalie lost her moment , in the split second during which she realized that he had been hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly endless debate over what to say and do ( " Stop acting like a child , my dear , " her hand gently on his ? ) , and by the time she had finally decided that his remark was to be treated as a joke , he had swung around in his chair to face her and was saying , " Well , Natalie ? " She smiled , and the moment became unexpectedly one of excruciating embarrassment . Natalie heard the back ofp130her mind gibbering obscenities , and thought for a mad moment that she might be saying them aloud and not realizing ; perhaps , she thought , I am undressing , or in the bathroom , or looking at myself in the mirror , and only pretendingthat I am here alone with Arthur Langdon ; perhaps I am here with Arthur Langdon and pretending that I am dressing and talking really to myself ; perhaps I will say something frightful and never know whether I have really said it or not , because of course he would pretend I never said it but he would always remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth for the hundredthtime about the girl ( Natalie ? Helen ? Joan ? ) who had said the shocking thing to him , and Natalie laughed suddenly , bringing herself immediately back to the present in Arthur Langdon 's office , where she certainly was at the moment , and he was saying curiously , " What were you thinking about ? " " I was thinking about when I would be dead , " Natalie said . " Dead ? " he said , surprised . " Are we going to die , you and I ? " " I only worry about how , " Natalie said soberly ; unlike most of the things she found herself saying to Arthur Langdon , this was true . " I keep thinking that of course it 's got to happen , and even to me , but then I always think that somehow and someday this interesting person of mine will . . . " She searched for a word . " Subside , " she said finally . " I mean , I will be very suddenly aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any more for me , and that I am not going to be with myself any longer . And all of that 's all right , " she said , going on quickly as he openedp131his mouth to speak . " I 'm only afraid of being caught unaware , of that terrible fast panic that comes when you 're very very frightened , and of being afraid when it happens . So then , of course , I always think I 'll kill myself before it can happen . " She stopped , and Arthur Langdon said , " You have a very original mind , Natalie . " " That 's what I mean , " she said , thinking , Oh , the fool , " can you imagine having a mind like mine and losing it when you die ? " Had she , she wondered , had she the originalmind ? He waved his hand at the papers on the desk . " There are almost two hundred papers there , " he said . " I have to read every one of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Helen ? Anne ? ) " I find your criticisms very helpful , " Natalie said demurely . " My father discusses my work with me very much as you do . " She thought of her father with sudden sadness ; he was so far away and so much without her , and here she was speaking to a stranger . " Does your father think your work shows talent ? " " My father does not praise anyone . " " Do you plan to be a writer ? " A what ? Natalie thought ; a writer , a plumber , a doctor , a merchant , a chief ; the best-laid plans of ; a writer the way I might plan to be a corpse ? " A writer ? " she repeated , as though she had never heard the word before . He was staring at her with his mouth half-open ; she must have delayed her idiotic answer beyond any reasonabletime for thought . " Do you plan to be a writer ? " he asked again . He did mean it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why doesp132everyone say they 're going to be writers ? When they 're not ? I mean , why do you and my father and everybody say to be a writer ' as though it were something different ? Not like anything else ? Is there something special about writers ? " Her delay had not helped him any . " It 's because writing itself , " he began , hesitating , and then , " I suppose it 's becausewriting  --  well , it 's something important , I suppose . " " Well , then , what am I going to write ? " " Well . . . " he said . He looked at her and then irritably at the papers on his desk . " Stories , " he said . " Poems . Articles . Novels . Plays . " He shook his head and then said , " Anything  --  well , creative . " " But why is it so important , this creating ? " Natalie was positive at the moment that she was asking him something very important , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly ; she needed only one answer , only one , she thought , and then she knew that he would not tell her , because he shook his head and said , " Natalie , this is metaphysicalnonsense . Questioning one 's own soul is not somethingat which I am particularly good at any time , and certainly it is not a subject which ought to be indulged in broad daylight . Some other time , " he added , and laughed , " we can sit in the darkness under an oak tree and tell one another vast truths . " It was precisely as Natalie 's father would have rebuked her ; she sat back in her chair and thought , I will never ask him this again , and then thought , What a silly person I am , and now he does think I am a fool . " Tell me , " he said , leaning forward . " You were giving me your ideas about death .

" " They sent him a telegram , " Vicki said . " And the girl waited and waited and of course he never showed up . " " But everyone knew except her , " Anne said . " That was the joke of it . " " Did n't she ever find out ? " Natalie asked . " That was the best part , " Anne said . " Of course she found out later , and of course it was awful for her , but she had to be a good sport about it , naturally . It was only a joke , after all , and she waited and waited all dressed up for the dance . " " And remember the time they called up and pretended to be some guy 's mother and had this girl almost in hys-terics ?

" " She was sore , " Vicki said with satisfaction . " I should think so , " said Natalie . " But of course she had to be a good sport , " Vicki said . " And the time , " said Anne , giggling , " that they sent invitations to all the faculty , inviting them to a party , and on the bottom of the invitation it said in big letters Your wife is NOT invited ' ? " Vicki laughed . " There was trouble then , " she said . " Nothing 's the same since they graduated , " Anne said wistfully . " No one can think of anything to do , any more .

I have a notion you would hardly read a bare , invented example ) : " I like collegevery much , but am still a little confused . I do n't think I 'll ever learn French . I like philosophy , though . Is there any chance of your coming down soon ? " Ignoring the sense of the quotation ( except to mention , in passing , that it is not possible to " learn " French ; as I believe someone else has said , one either is or is not born with the kind of personality to which French is a mothertongue ) , let me only say that two self-evident remarks connected with " but " do not constitute an English style . Nor do a series of short sentences , unless they are building into something very clear and definite , which in your case seems to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment , and one your mother could hardly do without , but surely not an adequate consummation  --  almost , in fact , an anticlimax . Enough for your letter ; you are presumably studying English composition and we may expect to see an improvementsoon . Your mother and I are better able to avoid one another without you and your brother cluttering up the house . Your mother remarks nostalgically that thep135dinner table seems unusually deserted , which of course is true , although it persuades me finally that your mother has from the beginning counted her children only by the places set at table , and has marked your growth from one chop to two with pride and apprehension  --  soon her little girl will be quite grown up , and able to manipulate her own knife and fork . You may , however , suppose that we miss you . Has your Mr. Langdon seen my piece in the last PassionateReview ? If not , you may use its arguments as your own , and confound him . Obediently , DadNatalie 's journal ; middle October : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my darling Natalie , what I can find to be thinking about . I suppose you have even noticed  --  Natalie seems so strange lately , she seems so withdrawn and distant and quiet , I wonder if Natalie is coming along all right , or if there is something troubling her . Perhaps you have been thinking , dearest , that Natalie had something she wanted to say to you . Perhaps , you thought , Natalie is frightened and perhapsshe even thinks sometimes about a certain long ago bad thing that she promised me never to think about again . Well , that 's why I 'm writing this now . I could tell , my darling , that you were worried about me . I could feel you being apprehensive , and I knew that what you were always thinking about was you and me . And I even knew that you thought I was worried about that terrible thing , but of course  --  I promise you this , I really do  --  I do n't thinkp136about it at all , ever , because both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was some horrible dream that caught up with us both . We do n't have to worry about things like that , you remember we decided we did n't have to worry . No , what I have been thinking about is something entirelydifferent . I have been thinking  --  and it is very very hard to say this , so be patient with me  --  about the beautifulwonderful exciting things that are happening . That does not quite describe it . Look . Let me say it like this : when I came here to college I was all alone and that bad thing had just happened and I had no friends and no one to think about and I was always frightened . Now all of a suddenI find that I am walking around in a world very full of other people , and because they are all frightened too I can afford to be frightened , and then once I know I am frightened then I can go ahead and forget about it and start looking around at other things . And of course now I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the people who do n't dare be all alone need friends . I do n't suppose I will need any friends or anything for the rest of my life , now that I am not frightened . But of course I think sometimes ( thank heaven no one will ever read this but you and me , my dear ) about being in love , which is something I hardly expect ever to happen to me , but I think I have just a slight idea , from the way I feel about other things , what it would be like . I think , for instance , that no , one can really love a person who is not superior in every way . For instance , I know from how I feel about people who are superior to me in some things just exactly how I would feel about someonep137who was superior to me in everything , which of course would be the only kind of person I could really love . I wanted to tell my father about this , and I wanted to tell Arthur too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to some man and say that you could never really love any person who was not superior to you in everything and let them see clearly that they are not that . I wish I knew why I am so excited all the time . I keep thinking something is going to happen . I keep thinking I am right on the point of telling someone all about myself . I wonder what I would say to a psychoanalyst . I wonder where people find words for all the funny things inside their heads . I keep turning around in circles and finding how well things fit together , but nothing is ever complete . I think if I could tell someone everything , every single thing , inside my head , then I would be gone , and not existingany more , and I would sink away into that lovely nothing-space where you do n't have to worry any more and no one ever hears you or cares and you can say anything but of course you would n't be any more at all and you could n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course I realize that the first thing to do if you wanted someone to tell you everything would be to make your minds go along together , so that if for instance a psychoanalystwanted me to tell him everything in my head , he would have to be very close to me so that our minds were running exactly together , coinciding , and what I told him would not be told , really , but only an echo of the way both our minds were going , and would sort of cancel out . And there , you see , is what I mean by superior , becausep138after all this he would have to have enough left over after he had taken all my mind , so that he could keep on thinkingby himself , after I was nothing . But of course I do n't believe anybody really exists like that and that all these people like Elizabeth who talk about going to psychoanalystsdo n't want this at all , or perhaps their minds are so little and move on such a small amount of energy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself to capture them and have plenty of mind left over , so as not to be absorbed in them at all particularly . And that , I suppose , is why these people find it so easy to get along with the idea of having their minds taken away from them , because their minds were never very useful to them in the first place . Although I do not have to worry about being modest here , it is certainly not necessary to point out to you that Elizabeth is not as wise as I am . I want somebody who will fight about it , too . Suppose there is a person , somewhere very near me , right now , who is thinking about me and who watches me and knows everything I think about and who is just waiting for me to recognizeOdd things , these days , came back into Natalie 's mind . For instance , she remembered a scene that happened when she was about six years old ; it recurred to her often , and mostly during classes when her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , with her eyes fixed earnestly upon the front of the room , wandered away by herself . The scene she remembered so clearly was of herself , small vague Natalie in a pair of shorts and sneakers , looking honestly and with the eyes of pure truthp139up at her mother , who bent down over her and listened with concern . " I found a wishing stone , " little Natalie was telling her mother . " I knew it was a wishing stone because when I dug it up it looked like a wishing stone , so I held it tight in my hand and closed my eyes and wished for a bicycle , and then nothing happened at all and so I threw the stone away . " Natalie could still , this many years later , see her mother 's stricken eyes . She remembered that her father had laughed , and that her mother had begged for the bicycle for Natalie ; these cynical later days , Natalie suspected that her mother had been right . It was less important , Natalie thought , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children than to keep alive her mother 's faith in magic . Too , Natalie saw now that if she had kept the wishing stone until the right time came , she could have used it to wish for a bicycle on that Christmas Eve when a bicycle was so obviously awaiting her under the Christmastree . Then , magic would have been sustained , and cause and effect not violated for that first , irrecoverable time . Behind Natalie a girl said aloud , puzzled , " Well , I think that if Romeo wanted her so much all he had to do was take her . I mean , why all that bother with secret marriages and stuff when they could just walk off together ? " Must n't violate the sacred rules of magic , Natalie thought sleepily . Never wish for anything until it 's ready for you . Never try to make anything happen until it 's on its way . The formal way is best , after all ; no short cuts allowed in this passage . " Seems to me , " said someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the ending was happier it would be a better play . "  |p140She  was a minute or two late and was trying to phrase apologies in her mind when she knocked softly on the door of the Langdons ' house . It was a perfectly legitimate delay , but it was difficult to tell Elizabeth Langdon that one was late for tea with her because her husband had stood in the center of the path , refusing to recognize any hints about appointments , asking endless questions , making wellturnedcompliments . . . she knocked again , a little more emphatically . The door was not latched , and slipped back and open under her hand . For a minute she stood there and then , thinking that she was expected and tellingherself she would do the same anywhere , she pushed the door a little farther and stepped in . For a minute she saw nothing and then , all at once , she saw Elizabeth Langdon asleep with her head on the arm of the couch , and the thick line of smoke rising from the upholstery near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth , " before she thought to say , " Mrs. Langdon , " Natalie went to the couch and pushed Elizabeth 's head aside , and began to slap at the burning couch . " Oh my God , " said Elizabeth from somewhere behind Natalie . She too began to slap at the chair , hitting Natalie'shand , and then she said , " Wait , wait , " and ran down the hall and into the kitchen . The cigarette that had fallen from Elizabeth 's hand had burned itself out of sight in the couch , and the smoke coming from some horrible secret innerpart choked Natalie as she leaned over it . Elizabeth came back behind her with a shakerful of cocktails and said with a giggle , " Could n't wait to fill a pitcher with water . Got to remember to save two drinks . " Natalie knocked her arm away so that the cocktails poured on thep141floor , and said , " That stuff burns ! Get water ! " Elizabeth stared vacantly , and Natalie , thinking , I am acting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucepan with water and hurried back , spilling water on the hall floor as she ran , and poured the water carefully and accurately into the burning hole on the couch . As the smoke died away Natalie realized that Elizabeth was laughing , and she began to laugh too . The hole became a sodden ugly spot , the smoke stopped , and the room suddenlysmelled most violently of gin . Elizabeth lifted the shaker and peered into it . " Terrible waste , " she said . " I 'll never be able to drink it , " Natalie protested , laughingbecause it was over and she felt that she had been perhaps a little impulsively heroic . " I thought you were on fire , " she explained with embarrassment . " I nearly was , " Elizabeth said , wide-eyed . " Thanks , " she said . " I 'm sorry I shouted at you , " Natalie said . They stared at one another uncomfortably for a minute . Then Elizabethsaid , " Saved some cocktails , anyway . " " Spilled water on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " Elizabeth said largely . " That 's the third time I 've done it , you know . Fires , I mean . " " The third time ? " Natalie said , unbelieving . Elizabeth nodded . " Third time this year , " she said . " Once the fat in the frying pan caught fire because I was n't watching it , and before I could put it out the kitchen curtainscaught , and then if Arthur had n't been there my dress would have caught but he pulled me out of the way and put the fire out . He was so frightened he could n't talk . I could have been killed . "  | " That 's terrible , " said Natalie earnestly . " And the second time was when I accidentally dropped a lighted match into the wastebasket in Arthur 's study , and the wastebasket flamed right up and that time my skirt did catch fire , but I picked up the wastebasket and ran into the bathroom and turned on the shower and threw the wastebasket under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . " " I 'll bet he was frightened then , " Natalie said . " He was when I told him . He wanted me to stop smoking . He said  --  " Elizabeth looked at Natalie queerly "  --  he said I was trying to kill myself . " " Are you ? " Natalie asked in spite of herself . Elizabeth shook her head . " I do n't know , " she said mournfully . " I really do n't know . Sometimes , though , I think I have cause . " She stopped , thinking , and there was a silence . Natalie stirred uneasily , and Elizabeth said , " Serve him right , too . " " That 's no way to die , though , " Natalie said . " It certainly is not , " said Elizabeth , and shuddered . " My God , I was scared , " she said . " Me , too . " " Well , " Elizabeth said , as though done with the subject . " How about we finish off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " I do n't know if I can stand it , " she said , and gestured at the room at large . " Seems like it 's intoeverything . " " You wo n't notice it after you 've had a drink , " Elizabeth said . The shaker sat on the table where she had put it down , and she picked it up and looked into it again . " There 's really quite a lot left , " she said , and carried it withp143her out into the kitchen to get glasses . While she was gone Natalie opened the window and stood looking out onto the college campus . Somehow , inside this room , in the house , she was removed from those girls in their bright sweaters who walked easily across the grass , under the colored trees , ignoring the paths and putting their clean brown-and-white shoes down as though their tuition had bought them a permanentshare in this very land . They understood the functioningof the college , these girls outside , talking to one anotheras they walked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were intimate and sympathetic with this college , and never saw it as the spot where Arthur Langdon taught , or where one was held apart from home and kindness by the dubious good intentions of strangers . Inside here , Natalie thought , turning abruptly to look into the room and at the furniture and books and even the burned couch , inside this room is the only place except my own home where everybody knows my name . " At least two drinks apiece , " Elizabeth said gaily , " and probably more . " " Had n't we better save some ? " Natalie said prudently . Elizabeth 's face turned sullen . " At least this time , " she said , " he wo n't be able to say I drank them . This time he ca n't blame me . " She looked at the couch . " He ca n't even be angry at that , very well . " " I do n't think it 's badly burned , " Natalie said . Elizabeth shrugged . " Oh , well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because her favorite corner was burned she was forced to go to the other end , and she sat there uncomfortably , resting on her wrong elbow . " I was reading , " shep144said , looking irritably at the burned spot . " That 's what happened , I was reading . " " Next time put out your cigarette before you fall asleep . " " That 's what I get for reading , " Elizabeth said . She pointed with her toe to the book on the table . " Psychology , " she said . " I ca n't understand it . " " Then why do you do it ? " Natalie asked , wondering at the vast freedom of one who could learn if she chose and could , if she chose , flatly refuse to understand . " We all do it , " Elizabeth said . " All of us , the faculty wives . Got to do something , you know . And besides , it feels good to sit next to those kids in class and look at them frowning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit there thinking how much more you know than they do , and they have to call you Mrs. Langdon . " " At least you do n't have any trouble passing . " Elizabeth made a face . " I never finish up the courses , " she said . " Those poor kids , they have to come rain or shine , and answer when they 're asked questions  --  me , I can just say , Go to hell , professor , ' and walk out if I 'm bored . " " How about your husband 's class ? " Natalie asked . " I took that class , " Elizabeth said , and laughed . " I got through the whole thing  --  and I passed , too  --  before I ever married Arthur . He used to give me back my papers with notes written on them . I 'd laugh out loud , sometimes , in class when he gave me my papers back with those notes on them . And he 'd read things like speeches from Antony and Cleopatra , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be just looking at him like lovesick chickens , and I 'd think of how anytime I wanted I couldp145get him to read the same things to me all alone and I 'd look around that class and think how pathetic those kids were and I 'd want to laugh in their faces . " A great envious excitement filled Natalie ; she promised herself quickly that she would somehow , later , examine how it would feel to sit in class with such special secret knowledge , with such delicious sense of possession . Elizabeth sighed . " I liked that class , " she said . She was smiling reminiscently still as she rose to fill Natalie 's glass . " And sometimes , " she said , " I 'd meet people like Mr. and Mrs. Watson  --  he was my biology teacher then  --  and I 'd say , How do you do , Mrs. Watson , Mr. Watson , ' so politely , and all the time I 'd be thinking of how when Arthur and I were married I could call them Carl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners or college movies . And running into Arthur 's office whenever I pleased , and not caring who saw me . And staying out all night if I felt like it , and laughing in anyone 's face the next morning . And facultyparties , " she said , " and pouring at teas . And getting the best of everything . " She sighed again , her head on her arm and her long hair falling against her face . " I thought it was all going to be so wonderful , " she said . Suddenly , again , Natalie felt the small chill of dismay when Arthur Langdon 's footsteps sounded outside the door and , with the opening of the door , the same familiar shock of finding him slightly smaller than she had rememberedhim . " Hello ? " he said , blinking after the bright sunlight outside , and then , his voice hard , " Smells like a brewery in here . " Elizabeth stood up quickly and hurried across the roomp146to him . " Arthur , " she said , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur , listen , I tried to kill myself again this afternoon  --  " It was on a Thursday evening early in November that the peculiar events in the dormitory where Natalie slept began to attract attention . On that Thursday evening ( there was a full moon , which several people insisted hysterically had certainly something to do with it ) the girl who lived alone in the room almost directly under Natalie 's arose from her bed asleep and unlocked her door and moved slowly and with seeming purpose down the hall . Where she could , she opened doors and went in to awaken all sleepers . At each bed , the story went , she bent over gently and smoothed the pillow , before giving the girl asleep a quick slap to awaken her . " No sleep tonight , " she told each of them pleasantly , and left the room . By the time she had reached the end of the hall a group of girls had gathered , half-asleep and frightened and talking among themselves in whispers . One girl who found herself more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , and , approachingthe sleepwalker , threw a blanket around her ; then half a dozen girls of great courage half-carried the sleepwalker  --  now walking awake  --  and shut her into the closet of her own room with the door locked , where she stayed all night , crying and promising to behave if they let her out . The next night  --  that would be Friday , with the sleepwalkersafely in the infirmary  --  word of thievery again spread through the house . Natalie , who had not been awakened the night before , was tonight on the outskirts ofp147the group that gathered swiftly in the hall  --  almost as though everyone had been waiting for some new excitement  --  whenone of the girls announced that she had caught another girl coming out of her room with a blouse in her hand . Miss Nicholas was quickly brought from her bed  --  she too had missed the excitement the night before , although she had been notified in time to let the girl out of the closet before breakfast  --  and , with judicious attention to all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with sober announcements about being sure before any charge was brought , searched thoroughly the room of the girl accused , assisted by the accuser and several friends . Although none of them were able to uncover any of the stolen articles , it was said and echoed that the girl could have sold the clothes and spent the money . One or two most subtle minds , who volunteered to help the girl tidy up her room after the searching party had finished , reportedlater in the smoking room that she had said nothing which might be construed as incriminating . On Sunday afternoon , while most of the girls and Miss Nicholas were at Sunday dinner , one of the girls on the top floor , who had stayed away from dinner because she had to lose two pounds by the next weekend in order to fit into the dress she was wearing to a houseparty dance , walked out of her room and saw a man running down the stairs . It was decided that he was a Peeping Tom , and several of the girls recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown coat hanging around outside the dormitory , as though he were a janitor , or something . One of the girls , who had been severely surprised when she was eleven years old by a man who exposed him/self before her as she passed him on the street , explained that this was a kind of neurosis some men had . Many people recalled having heard that such things happened frequently around women 's colleges , and one girl left school because she wrote her mother some of the things she heard around the smoking room . A senior girl , questioned in the smoking room , said that such things always came in waves . It was a college season , she explained . She told some of the things that had happenedduring comparable seasons when she was younger , and added that she believed it had something to do with the fact that the Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations were due soon . " Some people have trouble adjusting betweencollege and home , " she explained . The girl who had been accused of stealing left college , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that her allowance check was missing from her room . It turned out during the next day or so that several people were losing things ; one girl went to look for an angora sweater she had put away in her bottom drawer and it was gone ; shortly after that , two cartons of cigarettesdisappeared from another room , and everyone in the house who smoked that particular brand changed abruptly . A very brief enthusiasm sprang up for bringing tiny bottles of ruin into the dining room and adding the rum to the dinner coffee . This was replaced by an inexplicable and childish two-day enthusiasm for pig-latin . Also in the dining room one evening , an entire tableful of girls rose and walked out in the middle of the meal because they were refused more bread . A girl on the third floor who was seen cryingp149was reported faithfully as suffering from a venereal disease and a petition was sent to Miss Nicholas to require the girl to use the basement lavatory . Miss Nicholas was reported to be secretly married , and the Peeping Tom identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Two girls in another house tried to kill themselves with double closes of the infirmary sleeping medicine . An unnamed girl , also in another house , was said to have died of an abortion , and several people knew the name of the baby 's father , who was reliably identified as a local man who worked as a lifeguard summers and in the gas station winters . It was generally believed that it was completely possible to become pregnant by using the same bathtub as one 's brother , although not necessarily at the same time . November 12-no , 13 Natalie , my dear , It is late at night , and I have just come home from a rather ribald gathering , and nothing , it seems to me at the moment , would delight me more than a note of paternalwarning to my only daughter . May I  --  and through how many faulty media  --  may I , then , issue one note of paternal warning ? And over again I reflect on the faulty media  --  mine own words , the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you at all , that your benevolent housemother ( Old Nick , did you say ? ) should not read this herself and destroy it , that your house should not burn down and this letter with it , that the stamp should not fall off nor the address be erased by some postal cataclysm  --  suppose , indeed , daughter , it should be one of those letters we read about in the daily newspapers ,  |p150lost  for twenty years , but faithfully found and delivered at the end of that time  --  how will you feel , twenty years from now , reading a lost letter from your father , with advice well meant and long useless  --  faulty media ? I begin to perceivethat it is impossible for this letter to reach you at all . Let me , then , warn you direfully against false friends . And against those for whose friendship toward you you can find no material motive . And against all fawners , all liars , all nodders . Believe me , girl , without a motive no friendshipcan be , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be father to daughter or lover to wife , no friendship can come to birth without it have a motive and an end in view. * And further , daughter , I charge you : do not trust entirely to your own knowledge for these things . One person inaccurate upon his own behavior may neverthelessbe accurate upon yours . Consult , therefore , the blind and honest ; they can do you no harm , and one , at least , wishes you none . LaterNatalie , I wrote this much last night and would not for the world deprive you of my paternal effusions , particularly since I can see that in spite of my heavy manner , very much , I believe , in the style of an Old-Testament God , I was trying to say something very real , which I must have supposed last night you were old enough to hear . What worries me is , I think , the fact that in your letters you show* Here I perceive imperfectly my own meaning , and apologizeif you understand , but if you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to keep it in mind until you do . Do you get any other letters with footnotes ?  |p151yourself  as not entirely happy . I have been sure for a long time that things were difficult for you , but please remember , my dear , that they would have been difficult anywhere . I chose this college for you because I knew that it was a fairly exclusive , expensive place and , while I pretend to no less snobbishness than any man , it seemed to me additionallyvaluable in that you will , snobbishness or not , find intelligenceand culture accompanying persons of a certain social class . There is no doubt but what the class of girls you have as friends is not a representative one , but my plans for you never did include a broad education ; an extremely narrow one , rather  --  one half , from the college , in people and surroundings ; the other half , from me , in information . My ambitions for you are slowly being realized , and , even though you are unhappy , console yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to be unhappy for a while . The fact that you associate intimately with girls who do not care for the things you do should strengthen your own artistic integrity and fortify you against the world ; remember , Natalie , your enemies will always come from the same place your friends do . So try to bear with these girls , try not to let their occasional silliness upset you , try not to let them cultivate you for mental values rather than social values  --  briefly , try to do what I advised last night : scrutinizecarefully anyone aspiring to be your friend , examine her conduct for motives , and deny your friendship if your estimateof her motives shows them ignoble . I should , if I were you , be extremely cautious with Arthur Langdon ; I have been re-reading his poems . He is a spiritual man , and one to whom things of the spirit are meaningful . Past a certain point this sort of person is not trustworthy ; he will expectp152more of your compliance than you should be ready to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under any circumstancesallow Arthur Langdon to convert you to any philosophical viewpoint until you have first consulted me . As the person who knows you most dearly , and who loves you always the best , I am equally the one most capable of telling you these things . It has been my plan , Natalie , all of it , and when you approach despair remember that even your despair is part of my plan . Remember , too , that without you I could not exist : there can be no father without a daughter . You have thus a double responsibility , for my existenceand your own . If you abandon me , you lose yourself . Your devoted , DadBeing assistant hostess to Vicki and Anne at cocktails was not in any way similar to standing up with Mrs. Arnold Waite to receive guests . For one thing , Mrs. Arnold Waite had been supplied , beyond all else , with the material for bribing people to like her house . On the other hand , since the college had once been progressive , and retained privilegeswhere it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve liquor and a minimal amount of food ( food , after all , was served in the dining room , but there was no bar on campus ) without the conviction , which Mrs. Arnold Waite had to perfection , that it was in any way possible to live differently . Ice might be readily procured at the college store , and carried dripping from a newspaper the length of the campus lawn . Toothbrush glasses might be freely confiscatedfrom the common bathrooms , rinsed inadequately , and dried on other people 's bath towels . There were , ofp153course , girls who brought their own sets of glasses to college , and kept them on the bookcases in their rooms , but thesewere mostly upperclassmen , or girls who realized that theirlives were unendurable without the tradition of dressing for dinner . At the entertainment proffered by Vicki , Anne , and Natalie , the glasses used to serve cocktails to Arthur and Elizabeth Langdon had been borrowed up and down the hall , so that on the front of the tray , with Vicki 's good vermouth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two unshipped and matched cocktail glasses , property of someone on the first floor who lent them with the information that if it had n't been for Arthur Langdon she would have declined and that , furthermore , Arthur Langdon or not , she would have the hide off anyone who broke them ; they had fine gold edges and looked really quite professional . Farther back on the tray , and hidden carelessly behind the gin bottle , were a chipped wineglass , a fruit juice glass stolen from the college dining room , and a plastic bathroom glass ; these were for Vicki and Anne and Natalie . On the bookcase next to the tray were a plate , also stolen from the dining room , a jar of cheese spread , and a box ofcrackers . The cheese was to be spread on the crackers with the wrong end of a nail file . " You see , the trouble with us , " Yield said sardonically , surveyingtheir preparations , " is that we try as hard as we can to live up to the standards of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " If you 'd like to take them into town to a restaurant , " Anne said , " you go right ahead . It 's your twenty bucks . " Natalie , who had supplied the crackers and cheese andp154felt a maternal obligation toward them , was trying to spread the cheese on the crackers with the nail file ; the crackers shattered into crumbs in her hands . " We should have gotten pretzels , " Natalie said . She was still very politeand tentative with Vicki and Anne , sternly repressing in herself the constant question as to why they bothered with her at all . She could have understood their kindness in includingher often on occasions such as this , inviting her to the movies , accompanying her to meals , if they had beensay  --  boredwith one another , or needing someone to run errandsfor them , or amused by her , or respectful of 1ier learning , but none of these estimates seemed reasonable  --  they were almost too careful of her , so complete in themselvesthat they needed no one and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her jokes , waiting for her to finish speaking before they began , indifferent to her quotations and yet seeking her company . If they liked her , then , it was for no reason . She had not found yet in them anything to excuse . " Anyway , " Anne said , " you give Lizzie a drink , and she does n't care if you spread the cheese with the bottom of your shoe . " " Look , " Vicki said , turning from Anne to Natalie . " What about Lizzie drinking ? Shall we make her take it easy ? " " I really think she 'll behave herself since she 's not in her own house , " Natalie said . Vicki laughed . " If she 's within reaching distance of a bottle ? They 're all so jealous of my catching Arthur , ' " she said in a high whining voice . " ' No one understands that I only want everyone to love me . ' " " I do n't think it 's any of our business , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't presume to judge her be-havior . " " Well , if Arthur does n't care , I do n't , " Vicki said . " Listen , there 's the doorbell . " She ran out of the door and down the stairs . They were entertaining in what might be called Vicki 's room , which made her nominal chief hostess ; Vicki 's room and Anne 's were on a corner of the second floor of the house , and were prized by all students as the most desirable location on campus . Vicki and Anne had kept the corner rooms for two years ; they had lived here together through two years when these rooms must have been more intimately home to them than the island Elizabeth Langdon despised , or the other homes they knew where the rooms were larger and the service better . The room which was listed as Vicki 's in the college offices had been made into a study , and Anne 's room a bedroom ; they entertained , naturally , in the study . This room proudly held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campus ; the bookcases were **25;5712;TOOLONG furniture , but then , as Anne had told Natalie reluctantly , bookcases that size were so difficult to transport , and the wastebasket was an undeniable college wastebasket . There were , besides , a studio couch , and a coffee table , and a modern lamp . The pictures on the wall had been painted by Vicki in her second-year art class , and were beautifully framed ; the books in the bookcases showed precisely which classes Vicki and Anne had attended duringtheir college years , and gave an occasional sense of their having sampled all the possible courses given at the college in order to learn the names of the textbooks . The blockprint on the curtains had been especially designed forp156a whimsical sort of person by someone who could afford to do so , the rug was softer than most college beds . How this room could exist not more than one floor and half a dozen doors from her own bare small room on the third floor was a matter of continual surprise to Natalie , and it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and stayed here , only as some kind of a concession which they made with their usual courtesy to the college authorities . Possessed tonight of a part-interest in the room , by right of the crackers and cheese she had supplied , Natalie rose with dignity from the studio couch and came to stand in the doorway with Anne , careful not to come too close . They could hear Vicki greeting the Langdons downstairs . " So glad you came , " Vicki was saying , and " Come on upstairs , Nat and Anne are waiting . " They could hear the Langdons coming up the stairs before they could see them rounding the turn halfway . " I wish . . . " Anne said , and then was silent . What would she have said if I had been Vicki ? Natalie wondered , and felt Anne sigh and saw Elizabeth Langdon coming up the last part of the stairs . She was dressed up , perhaps more than the occasion demanded . She was wearing a dark-blue dress , very tight at the waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much heavy jewelry ; it was a dress more fitting for a student than for a faculty wife , with its pretty cut more suitable for a date with a college boy then a cocktail with three college girls . Perhaps Elizabeth had felt this when she dressed , because she had added to her costume a most mature hat , with a caught-up veil and a frill of small feathers , not at all the sort of hat which might be worn by anyone who described herself as a " pretty girl " rather than " an attractive woman . " She looked , altogether , very handsome , and would have looked far handsomer if Anne had not been wearing a soft rose wool dress which touched up the highlights in her blonde hair . Natalie had spent some little time over her own clothes and felt more gaunt and ungraceful than ever , standing in a small circle with Elizabethand Vicki and Anne ; but , she thought to console herself , no one is looking at me anyway . For a minute they hesitated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth to forgo an entrance and come into the room normally . At last , by judicious edging backward by Natalie and Anne , and tactful urging from behind by Vicki , Elizabeth was subtly introduced into the room and seated in an armchair ; she tried to go to the couch to sit in what was most closely approximate to her own spot at home , but was forestalledby Vicki , who insisted upon the armchair . Elizabeth sat , then , uneasily , with the two bookcases meeting behindher back and the open windows across from her . Anne sat on the couch next to Arthur Langdon , who had entered the room last , and quietly , as though he had only come along unwillingly with his wife , and Vicki and Natalie hovered uncomfortably over the small table at the side of the room , the one over the tray of liquor and glasses , the other over her cheese . " You 've changed things around , " Arthur said to Anne , thus committing with a grand unconsciousness his first magnificentblunder of the afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetly . " How do you think it looks , Mrs. Langdon ? We find it maddening to make these college rooms look civilized . "  | " If you used the college furniture you would n't have so much trouble , " Elizabeth said , moving in her chair . " It looks nice , though . " " Like a warehouse , actually , " Anne said . " You know , everything piled up together . If we only had some space . " " Very pleasant place to work , " Arthur said . " Writing papers for Langdon 's class , " Anne said . Everyonelaughed gaily . " I may think I 'm making something here , " Vicki said , over their laughter , " but actually it 's more mudpies than anything else  --  heaven only knows what I 'll have when I 'm through . " " May I help you ? " said Arthur immediately . " I 'd be ashamed , " Vicki said . She lifted the vase they had decided looked just enough like a cocktail shaker to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , shook her head dubiously , and said , " Well , how wrong can you go , with just gin and vermouth ? " Arthur closed his eyes in pain , and Anne said to him , ' You 'd better make the next round . " Vicki began to pour the cocktails carefully into the two good glasses , and Anne said politely to Elizabeth , " You look so well , Mrs. Langdon ; that dress is so becoming . " " You look well , too , Anne . " She has promised Arthur to be civil , Natalie thought with sudden pity ; she is pretending to be Old Nick being gracious . " You look as though you 'd been out in the sun all day , " Anne said to Elizabeth . Elizabeth smiled deprecatingly . " I 've been doing house-work . " " I sometimes think , " said Anne , who was perhaps imagin/ing that she was Old Nick being gracious , " that housework must be really the most satisfying work of all . " Elizabeth stared at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Arthur , " It must be wonderful to see  --  well , order out of chaos , and know that you 've done it yourself . " " I suppose you 've never scrubbed a floor ? " Elizabeth asked . She was still sitting very stiffly in her chair , her hands folded in her lap over her suede pocketbook and her gloves . She turned her head to watch whomever was speaking , and when Vicki brought her a cocktail in the first good glass , she accepted it with an unsmiling bow of thanks , and sat holding it poised in her hand . Arthur got the second good glass , of course , and sipped at it imme .. diately in order to nod to Vicki and say , " Very good in , deed , " with a faint air of surprise . " Is it really ? " Vicki said . She nodded her head proudly . " I always knew I could do it if I tried . " Natalie had achieved several unbroken crackers with cheese on them , and she passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked up without expression and said to Natalie , " And how are you , my dear ? Studying hard ? " " Not hard enough , I 'm afraid , " Natalie said . You ought to meet my mother , she was thinking . " What accomplished hostesses you all are , " Arthur said , when she passed the plate to him . " There 's a real art to getting cheese on crackers , " Natalie said . " It 's a talent every young girl should have , making and serving a good cocktail , " Arthur said . " I 'll have to take lessons , then , " Anne said.  |p160There  was a small silence , and then Elizabeth said , " Arthur dear , do you realize that these girls have gone to a vast amount of trouble and expense just to entertain us ? " " I think it extremely kind of them , " Arthur said gallantly . " You were very kind to come , " Anne said , and Vicki said , " It 's a pleasure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , in-deed . " " I am sure we were both delighted to come , " Elizabeth said . She sipped daintily from her glass and said , " Quite a good cocktail , Vicki . " " Thank you , Mrs. Langdon , " Vicki said . " What do you hear from your father ? " Arthur asked Natalie . Natalie laughed . " He said if you had n't read his piece in the latest Passionate Review , I could use its arguments to confound you . " Arthur was delighted . He laughed , and drank deeply from his glass , and put the glass down , and laughed again . " Splendid , " he said largely . " As a matter of fact , I have n't gotten to it yet , so you would have a real advantage over me . " " I have n't read it either , " Natalie confessed , and this furtherdelighted Arthur . " I do n't think Natalie ever reads Daddy 's articles , " Anne said in her soft voice . " Vicki and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she smiled , managing an unexpected dimple "  --  could n't understand a word of it . I could no more manage to confound anyone . . . " She moved her hands helplessly . " Nat is so smart , " she said . " We 've been dying to meet him , " Vicki told Arthur , " but Nat is ashamed we 'll disgrace her by looking like fools . "  | " Which we would , " Anne said . " Can you imagine me tellingDaddy I could n't understand a word he wrote ? " Natalie , who could precisely imagine Anne telling her father she could not understand a word he wrote , said with amusement , " I think he 'd be flattered . " Anne said to Elizabeth , " We 're all afraid of Nat anyway ; do you know she writes the most wicked descriptions of all of us to her father ? I positively dream sometimes of what Nat is telling Daddy about me . " " Is that so ? " Arthur asked with interest . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing do you write , for instance ? " Elizabeth asked with sudden real curiosity . " All about everyone you know ? " " That 's not a fair question to ask anyone , my dear , " Arthur cut in smoothly . " Natalie and I have discussed her writing very conscientiously , " he added , and Natalie , rememberingtheir conscientious discussion of her writing , was tempted to describe it to Elizabeth . " And , " he continued , " believe me , I have the greatest faith in Natalie 's talent . " Elizabeth turned her eyes from her husband to regard Natalie for a long minute . Then she said , " I suppose that sort of thing is all right to do until you 're married . " " And after you 're married , " Anne said lightly , " you 're too busy doing housework . " " May I pour anyone another drink ? " Vicki said . There was a silence while they all consulted the contents of their glasses . " Thank you , " said Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Anne . " Mrs. Langdon ? " said Vicki . Everyone avoided lookingp162while Elizabeth glanced down at her glass , barely touched . She shook her head , turning slightly to her husband . " No , thank you , my dear , " Elizabeth said . Everyone had another cocktail except Elizabeth and Natalie , who was beginning to feel that she had seen more drinks than books in her first few months of college . In one of her letters to her father she had told him , " I am beginning to think that the symbol of college , at least for me , has been a kind of drink I never remember seeing much before . Martini . What do you suppose the name means ? I know the names of most drinks have no sense to them anyway , but this one sounds like it had been named after someone ; do you suppose he could have been a college president ? " Her father had written back : " A martini is a sort of cocktail ( which I do not , myself , regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearly defined type of person . As far as my experience makes it possible for me to judge , this person is usually volatile , high-strung , and excitable . All of these are qualities shared by good vermouth , which is one of the ingredients of a martini . Another ingredient is gin , which is feminine and appears more harmlessthan it is : another characteristic of your martini-drinker . The third ingredient of the martini is bitters , and I need labor my metaphor no further , I hope . I will add that the drink is served ice-cold , that some people prefer to have the ingredients shaken , some prefer them stirred , that it is possible to refine one 's position with regard to the martini by discarding the traditional olive , and passing along further stages of refinement through the black olive , the twist of lemon peel , to the final , most effete , pearlp163onion . It is thus possible , you will perceive , to express the most exquisite shadings of personality  --  but I believe I have made myself more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe without taxing your forming critical mind that by definition the martini is a natural college cocktail . " " We have to be at the Clarks ' at six , " Elizabeth was remindingArthur . Arthur nodded . " Plenty of time , " he said . " I 'm so sorry , " Anne said to Arthur . " We hoped you 'd go into town later and have dinner with us . " " Our engagement for tonight is of several weeks ' standing , " Elizabeth said grandly , sipping then at her drink with her eyes on Anne . " Naturally we ca n't disappoint the Clarks , but I told Arthur you girls would be so unhappy if we did n't come here first , even for just a few minutes ; I really had to persuade him to come . " " So glad you did , " Vicki said . " Another drink ? " Elizabeth looked again into her glass , and again at Arthur . " I thought I 'd never stop laughing , this morning in class , " Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Elizabeth , " They 're terribly weak . " " Weak ? " Elizabeth said . " Weak . They are weak . " She made the word sound comic , and she handed over her glass . Vicki filled it quickly and brought it back , and then sat down next to Elizabeth , on the floor with her legs crossed . Natalie , who was sitting on the floor with her legs crossed on the other side of Elizabeth 's chair , moved to sit at precisely the angle Vicki adopted , and Vicki clearly and deliberately nodded at her , as though to say : We 're doing beautifully ; good work.  | " I love that pin , " Vicki said to Elizabeth lavishly . " Thank you , " Elizabeth said coldly ; it was to be clearly understood that she did not like Vicki and she did not court flattery . " Will you look at the colors in that pin ? " Vicki said to Natalie . " Have you ever seen anything so lovely ? " " Beautiful , " said Natalie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe it is , " Elizabeth said to Natalie . It was to be clearly understood that while she did very likely regard Natalie with some favor , she was not prepared to commit herself until she found out exactly how far Natalie was in turn committed to Vicki . " I wish I could make you understand how much we all admire you , " Vicki said to Elizabeth . " All the things you do  --  taking care of your husband and your house , and keepingup with classes , and still somehow managing to look so lovely all the time , and everything . " Natalie , thinking , She surely can not accept this seriously , heard with surprise Elizabeth saying with modesty , " Well , of course , I do n't really . . . " and Vicki interrupting smoothly , saying , " Another drink ? " At six-thirty , then , Elizabeth sat up suddenly in her chair and said , " Arthur , what time is it ? We have to go to the Clarks ' . " " Plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the Clarks ' for dinner , " Elizabeth explained to Vicki and Natalie . " They must be expecting us because they 're expecting us for dinner . " " It 's very early , " Vicki said . " Plenty of time , " Natalie said.  | " Have another drink , " Anne said , and giggled . Natalie was reciting to herself , softly , " Around the campusand double quick , Have a drink with Annie and Vick ; Vick 's the butcher , Anne 's the thief , And Langdon the boy who buys the beef . " She thought she had better not copy this out to send to her father ; she was not , at this point , precisely sure of the metre . It seemed to her that she had spent too long sitting in one position , and she got up and stretched lazily . " Where you going ? " Elizabeth demanded immediately . " We 've got to go to the Clarks ' . Arthur ? " He turned . " Plenty of time , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What time is it ? Anyone know what time it is ? Because we 've got to go to the Clarks ' . " " I know , " Arthur said . " We 've got to go to the Clarks ' . But we can be a little bit late , ca n't we ? " " Are we late ? " Elizabeth said . She appealed to Natalie . " Are we late for the Clarks ' ? " " Not at all , " said Vicki . " You have plenty of time . " " Time for another drink , anyway , " Arthur said . " Only across campus , after all , " he told Natalie . " You 've had too much to drink now , " Elizabeth said . " You ca n't go to the Clarks ' drunk , Arthur darling . You know , " she said to Natalie , " we should n't have come here at all . I wanted to call you and say we could n't possibly make it , but he told me , Elizabeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expense just for us , ' he said . And so we came here first , but now we 've really got to be getting along to the Clarks ' . " " Suppose I call them and say you 'll be a minute or sop166late ? " Vicki asked brightly . " That way they surely would n't mind . " Elizabeth looked at Vicki and then uncertainly at Arthur . " Will we be late ? " she asked . " Because the Clarks have gone to great trouble and  --  " " Only a minute or so late , " Vicki said . " Time for one for the road , " Arthur said . At about eight-thirty it became pressingly necessary to dispose of Elizabeth . Arthur Langdon , who seemed to noticeonly suddenly , got up from the couch and crossed the room to where Elizabeth had been sitting ever since she first came in , and , looking down at her without expression , said , " Why in God 's name does she always have to do this ? Ca n't we ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Anne said tenderly . " Should we take her home ? " " Nothing else to do , " Arthur said . His voice had become a little bit shrill , and Natalie , watching him as he stood between Vicki and Anne , wondered how she could ever have admired him , or thought of him together with her father . " Why does this always happen ? " he demanded . " We can see that she gets home , " Vicki said . She glanced at Natalie and Natalie nodded , and said , " Certainly . " " Would you ? " Arthur said , relieved . " Because I 'm really too angry with her to care . " " I 'm sure she 'd go with Nat , " Vicki said . " She 's very fond of Nat . " " Who is n't ? " Anne said fondly . " Nat , see if you can get her to stand up . " With the infinite superiority and tolerance that comes top167a moderately sober person addressing a very drunken one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go home ? " It is really an instinct , the knack of dealing with irrationalpeople , Natalie was thinking ; I suppose that any mind like mine , which is so close , actually , to the irrational and so tempted by it , is able easily to pass the dividing line between rational and irrational and communicate with someone drunk , or insane , or asleep . " Elizabeth , " she said severely , " wake up , Elizabeth . " " Why does she always have to do this ? " Arthur said . He appealed to Anne . " Why ? " he insisted . " I think she just has no head for liquor , " Vicki said wisely . " It affects some people that way , of course . " " But always , " Arthur said , looking as though he were about to cry . " I never have a good time because she 's alwaysdoing something like this . " " Elizabeth , wake up . " ( .. . and , bending over the maniac , writhing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word or two , and he , ceasing at that moment his struggles , opened his eyes and looked lucidly and gratefully up into her face . . . ) " Elizabeth , wake up . " " Golly , " said Anne . " She could sleep here . I mean , she could have my bed , and I could take the couch . " " She does n't deserve a bed , " Arthur said . " She ought to be in a gutter somewhere . " " Arthur ! " Anne said reproachfully . " Please do n't be so bitter ; remember who she is and  --  " " Let 's be sensible , " said Vicki quickly . " If we ca n't wake her or get her home , she 's got to sleep here , that 's only common sense . But I really think we can wake her and Ip168know she 'll go home with Natalie because she 's really terriblyfond of Natalie . " " I do n't remember ever seeing her do this before , after all , " Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicki said , " Elizabeth , " and Arthur , his voice at its firmest , repeated , " Elizabeth . " Finally , stirring , Elizabeth muttered , and moved , and opened her eyes . " Arthur ? " she said . " Listen , " Arthur said , leaning down to speak more forcefully . With his face close to hers , he said , " Elizabeth , we 're going to take you home . Now wake up and behave yourself , because we 're going to take you home . " " I 'm awake , " Elizabeth said crossly . " What 's the matter ? " " You 're going home , " Arthur said . " All right , " Elizabeth said contentedly . She held up her arms to him , and he stepped aside and let Natalie take her . At the touch of Elizabeth 's full , fumbling hands on her arms Natalie recoiled for a minute , but Arthur gave her an ungentlemanlypush , and she took Elizabeth around the shoulders and with Vicki 's help hoisted her out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth stood , speaking incoherently , and reaching her hands toward Arthur . Vicki took one of Elizabeth 's arms and swung it over her shoulder ; Elizabeth 's whole weight fell against Natalie , and Natalie , shivering under the pressure of Elizabeth 's legs against her , began half to pull , half to carry Elizabeth . " I 'd help you , " Arthur said nervously , " if I did n't think she 'd make a scene when she woke up and saw I was here . " " With Arthur and Anne helping from behind , where they were sure they would not be seen , Vicki and Natalie gotp169Elizabeth out the door and down the stairs . How inglorious , Natalie thought , going down the stairs with the heavy weight of Elizabeth against her , how perfectly abominable it is to be the receiver of such a thing , how dreadful and horrifying it is to have no choice at all about the swinging arms and legs that enwrap you , how sickeningto be aware and to know that the unconscious one does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how horrid , how nauseating , how weak . . . Could I let go of her now ? Natalie wondered , rounding the curve in the stairs , could I let her fall and kill herself , die perhaps , because I could not bear the holding of her ? What obligation do I have toward her , what call has she upon me , that she should be leaning intimately against me , and never knowing it ? How does she think I can bear it ? Will I ever lean so upon her ? Would she care , then , or let me fall ? " There we are , " Arthur said , at the foot of the stairs . Elizabeth was draped , half-conscious , over the stairpost . " Can you get her home ? " he asked Natalie . " I know how fond of you she is . " " I 'm sure I can , " Natalie said . " She seems to recognize my voice . " " She heard Nat when she did n't even move for the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie that she was , alone , to get Elizabeth home . " Listen , " she said anxiously , " I 'm not sure I can do it without  --  " " She 'll listen to you , " said Vicki over her shoulder ; she did not smile , but she was following Anne and Arthur up the stairs . " She likes you , " Vicki said , and disappeared around the turn in the staircase.  |p170It  was obviously impossible to leave Elizabeth . Even as Natalie turned in dismay to look at her , Elizabeth sagged , and began to slip gracefully to the floor . " Elizabeth , " Nataliesaid , wanting to cry , " oh , damn it . " She remembered , or tried hard to remember clearly , how Elizabeth had been the first person to speak to her kindly on this campus , and how it would be impossible in any case to leave Elizabeth here and join the others , because they would surely ask where Elizabeth had gotten to ; and how Elizabeth had told her unmentionable , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoons , and how everyone owed it to Vicki and Anne to get Elizabeth home and out of their way , because Vicki and Anne were friends too , and it would be hardly kind of Natalie to ignore such an obligationthey had left her , and if she left Elizabeth here it would mean possibly never seeing Vicki and Anne again , and surely not going back to them tonight , and so she might go alone to her own room if she chose , and , after all , she told herself , everyone was mortal and everyone was faulty and everyone was all together in one great world where only one life was vouchsafed to any of us , and there was never enough time to reflect on whether to do a thing or not to do a thing , because when you looked at someone it was someone no more or no less than another mortal , and , after all , who could deny another mortal some small solace in a life on this world , and , in the last analysis , Elizabeth . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's me , Natalie , " Natalie said , thinking at last how she should describe this to her father and tell him not to tell her mother.  | " Natalie ? " said Elizabeth . She moved a little away , and said again , " Natalie ? " " Elizabeth , " Natalie said gently . She put her arms around Elizabeth , and Elizabeth 's head fell against her shoulder and Elizabeth said , " Natalie , " softly , and Natalie was jubilantlyglad that she had not said , " Arthur , " again . " Natalie , I want to die , " Elizabeth said . " We 're going home , " Natalie said . " I want to die , " Elizabeth said . " I know you do , " Natalie said tenderly . " Come along home . " " Home ? " said Elizabeth . She was able to walk by herself , although Natalie had to guide her . As they went through the doorway out onto the campus Natalie was thinking , for some reason she never knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go from tree to tree across the campus , holding onto each one until they recovered themselves . Once out in the open air , however , Elizabeth recovered amazingly and walked alone , without even help from Natalie . " I want to die , " she said once . " Do n't be silly , " Natalie said , and added , " we all want to die , I suppose , from the minute that we 're born . " " No , " said Elizabeth , " I want to die . " It was difficult for Natalie to think clearly , walking across the dark campus under the trees with Elizabeth . For one thing , it had suddenly come to Natalie that when people were sober they repudiated everything they had done when they were drunk , and when they were drunk they repudiatedeverything they had done when they were sober . Natalie felt this to be very profound , and she worried overp172it , thinking , How silly I was to be frightened before , talking to Arthur , and what I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elizabeth said . " I wish I were Anne . " " I wish I were Anne , " Natalie said , and thought , That , I hope , is not true  --  except that she did wish that she were Anne , and the recollection of Anne bent over , listening intimatelyto Arthur Langdon speaking , had everything to do with the desire . " You know , " said Elizabeth wanderingly , stopping under a tree to point at Natalie , " Anne is a bitch and I used to be a bitch and now I 'm not any more . " She began to cry ; Natalie could hear her , although it was too dark to see . " Goddam little bitch , " Elizabeth said . The Langdons had left a light on in the foyer of their apartment . Natalie could see it and recognize it from halfwayacross the campus , and she blushed in the darkness to think of how often she had gone past the apartment and thought that Arthur lived there . " Six proud walkers , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bed , " Natalie said . As they approached the apartment Elizabeth began to sag again , and Natalie had to put an arm around her to support her . Suppose I were Arthur , she thought unwillingly , and suppose I wanted to do this . . . " Dark , " Elizabeth said . And suppose she were one of my students and I wanted badly to marry her , and suppose we were walking in the darkness just like this and I thought now , now , and supposejust the touch of her shoulder under my arm , so strong and firm across the weak flesh , suppose just that touch andp173that feeling , and suppose in the darkness she turned slightly toward me so that .. . " Natalie ? " said Elizabeth . " Are we nearly in bed ? " " Nearly , " Natalie said . " Only a little way now . " And suppose , suppose , only suppose , that in the darkness and in the night and all alone and under the trees , suppose that here , together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a warning , suppose in the darkness under the trees .. . " I want to die , " Elizabeth said . Natalie did not , mercifully , have to undress her . Once in her own home where she had gone staggering to bed alone so often , Elizabeth seemed to know by a molelike instinct what to do , and while Natalie worried in the brightly lighted kitchen over coffee and which burner to use on the stove , Elizabeth disappeared silently into the bedroom and took off her clothes . " Natalie ? " she called at last , and Nataliecame running , to find Elizabeth , in her own nightgown , in her own bed . It was the first time Natalie had ever visited the Langdons ' bedroom , and , while she had never been shocked at the twin beds in the bedroom of her mother and father , she was at this time grieved over the understanding that Arthur Langdon insisted upon  --  so young , so pretty  --  maintainingat night a space of floor between himself and Elizabeth . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do for you ? " " Good night , " Elizabeth said , and held up her face for Natalie to kiss her.  |p174Hesitantly  , Natalie moved around the foot of Arthur Langdon 's bed and to the side of his wife 's bed and femininelykissed Elizabeth upon the forehead . " Good night , " Natalie said . " Sleep well . " " Good night , darling , " Elizabeth said . " Good night , darling , " Natalie said . She tiptoed around the foot of Arthur 's bed and stood for a minute looking at Elizabeth already asleep in her bed before she turned out the light . On her way back across the campus she did not find anythingparticular in her mind to identify this evening beyond others marked in other ways . There was a strong feeling of triumph and an odd feeling of vengeance , and once when she stopped under a tree and leaned her head against its firm rough trunk she whispered softly , " I know , I know . " But that was all ; beyond that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without question she left the tree , satiated with the night and the stars indistinctly seen , and went on to the house where she lived , without ever troubling herself to look back at the light from the foyer of the Langdons ' apartment , which she had left on , after some thought , for Arthur to find his way home again . She went back into her own house , and quietly up the stairs , realizing with a shock from the sounds of voices in other rooms that it was still very early , perhaps not more than ten o'clock . She went immediately to the rooms which Vicki and Anne shared and found  --  as she had known without question , coming up the stairs  --  that they were dark . She went on up the stairs to her own dark room with itsp175locked door , the room which she had left , carefully dressed , at some time in the late afternoon , her own safe dear room , where she might sit by herself without interruption , and , as she entered with her key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white paper of the note on the desk . " Thanks very much , " it said . " How was Lizzie ? V. " Tuesday My dear captive princess , It is as much as any knight can do , these days , to keep in touch with his captive princesses , let alone rescue them . For one thing , I find my armor much too tight ; it has rusted since I last wore it in combat , and I can not for the life of me remember where I last saw my sword . I think of you , princess , languishing in your tower , peering anxiously forth from the narrow windows , wringing your long white hands and pacing the floor in your long white gown , looking constantlyout at the long winding road below , out to where it disappears among the mountains far beyond your tower . . . I keep thinking of you looking , and waiting , with no knight coming . And of course I shall come eventually , with or without armor ; perhaps I can find me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all what they used to be ) who will fashion for me some snowwhitearmor and a helmet to which I can attach some small insignia of yours  --  your old hockey stick , perhaps , with which I can also defend myself if need be . Or half a dozen pages from a learned quarterly , which might not prove so fine a means of defense , but would certainly mark me unerringlyas a knight errant . ( This last is a joke depending entirelyupon your knowledge of word roots . I have wasted toop176many jokes on you to let them pass now without identification . ) I am not quite sure , moreover , how to attack the dragon which guards your tower ; does he ever sleep ? Can he be bribed ? Drugged ? Enticed away ? Or must I fight him , after all ? Or , worse still , is there a dragon ? You are surely not confined only by magic ? I positively will not battle a sorcerer . Your mother insists that I include in this letter the statement that she has sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , off-the-shoulder-sleeves . She remarks sadly that that was what she always used to want , and I truly believe that it was an entirely goodhearted and unselfish gesture , that your mother honestly has sent you a black evening dress with off-the-shoulder-sleeves because , consideringmore than she usually does , she thought it the most wonderful gift a mother could possibly send her daughter . You have probably found easier ways of evading enchantmentsthan I shall ever learn . It has always been my opinion , you know , that princesses are confined in towers only because they choose to stay confined , and the only dragon required to keep them there was their own desire to be kept . And I further believe , now , that if you erect a tower , princesses will flock to it demanding to be locked up therein . So why do you not gratify your mother and myself , and , I believe , even your brother , by spending a weekend with us soon ? If you let me know when you choose to escape the dragon 's ceaseless vigilance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother 's theory that it would be the nicest thing anyone could send me . Your devoted , Dadp177Dear Sir Knight , It was not you , then , caroling lustily under my window these three nights past ? Nor one of your emissaries ? I fear me that the enchantment surrounding my tower is too strong for you , and that my rescue will not be effected for a thousand years  --  by which time , I wot , I shall be somewhatolder and grayer than I am now . At any rate , if it is not a dragon guarding me , it is something very like , somethingcalled a Maiden Lady ( and , her name being Miss Nicholas , she is of course also yclept Old Nick ) which , breathing fire , stamps around at the end of its own chain restraining more adventurous damsels from straying . I mean , I ca n't came home for a while yet . If there is any enchanter it is Arthur Langdon , who confidently expects that I will write him a thousand words about Milton by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I thought of comparing him with King Lear but it looked too hard . There is a very strange character around here who would interest you very much . She is always off by herself somewhere , and when I asked someone about her they laughed and said , " Oh , that 's that girl Tony Something . " I keep seeing her around and I think I would like to meet her . Tell Mother I got the dress and it 's beautiful . Do n't tell her I have no place to wear it . I did n't get invited to the Tech Dance , which is Friday night , but then neither did most of the girls I 've met around here . Apparently you have to know people here before you come , so that you do n't start out fresh making friends . Anyway , I feel sort of crestfallen about it , but when I watch the other girls whop178were not invited , and listen to them talking , I feel better because at least I have n't managed to think of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to go anyway , and they were asked , of course , but the boy was such an awful dancer they turned him down . . . and so on . I do n't have any excuse except I was n't asked . Anyway , tell Mother thanks very very much for the dress ; I tried it on and it was lovely . Everyone said it was very becoming to me . Speaking of magic , I figure that now I have once mentioned that I would like to meet that girl Tony , I will certainlymeet her soon . I have discovered that all you have to do is notice a thing like that concretely enough to say it , as in a letter like this , for it to happen . I suppose once I meet her I will be disappointed . As soon as I can write a thousand words of counter-enchantment , I will come home for a day or so . The sorcerer has a way of casting further spells on young women who ignore his simple ones . And I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what is good about him . Lots of love to you and Mother , NatalieIt had the feeling of middle-of-the-night when Natalie was awakened , and she thought for a minute , not coherently , that perhaps she was never to get a full night 's sleep again , and was n't it fine that she did n't mind being awakened if it was exciting , and then she opened her eyes into actuality and heard the urgent soft voice in her ear . " Wake up , " it said , " oh , please , wake up . " It was a whisperp179and without personality and , saying over and over again , " Please , please wake up , " it was terrifying . " What ? " said Natalie , hearing her own voice loud in the room . " Wake up , please , and be quiet  --  and hurry . " " I 'm awake , " Natalie said . It was unusually dark and the figure beside her bed was unidentifiable ; this then is the time , Natalie thought , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living until , when crisis and danger and terror are upon us all , and we are awakened in fear and run for safety ; who has been thoughtful enough to remember me in the general flight ? Fire ? she wondered as she had before , and , War ? " What is it ? " she whispered . " Hurry . " " I 'm hurrying , " Natalie said , reaching in the darkness for her bathrobe , feeling with her feet for slippers ; then , suddenly , she heard through the darkness the soft giggle and with it felt the first cold actual fear . War , at least , and fire , were possibilities . This , the giggle , was here in her own room . " What is it ? " Natalie said again . " Come on . And hurry . " Again the giggle . " You do n't need your bathrobe , come any old way . I 'm naked  --  but hurry . " " Listen , " Natalie said , fumbling her hand for the light cord , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled firmly , and the vague figure and the faint enduring giggle led her to the door . Natalie was without her slippersand without her bathrobe and in the cotton pajamas her mother had chosen for her , and on the pajamas was ap180pattern of black-and-red Scotty dogs , and the door into the hall showed further darkness instead of the usual night lights from the stairways and the bathrooms . " I turned them out , the lights , " said the voice ahead . " But hurry . " " What for ? " said Natalie , following down the dark hall . Again the quiet giggle . " You need n't think you 're the only one , " she said . " Wait till I show you what I 've got . " They were passing rooms in the darkness , Natalie knew , where girls slept peacefully , with their eyes closed and their hands relaxed against the pillows ; why , she thought almost hysterically , why do n't I just scream ? and knew with humor that she did not know how ; screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of coloratura not given to the many ; screaming was not something the Natalies might do unprepared . If I were really very frightened , Natalie thought , following barefoot the naked figure ahead , I might yell , or shout , but never deliver a telling scream ; then I am not really very frightened , she thought , since I am not able to make any kind of a sound at all , but only follow blind and dry through these black spaces and of course I am dreaming , of course , of course ; how profoundly interestedI am in all this , she thought . " And , " the voice was going on ahead , " you can lie very still and not move and not say anything and you can hear everything and even though they think you 're there they do n't know who you are and they go right ahead . And even when they come right into my room I just look at them and I say , Go ahead with what you were saying because I certainly do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are right in my room they certainly ca n't , can they ? And there 's thisp181little girl and she came into my room and she said , May I please sleep with you tonight ? ' and I said , Of course you may only I have to get up early in the morning but it 's four hours before I have to get up so you go right to sleep , ' and she got into my bed and she fell right asleep and she had these lovely little animals with her , like birds , or squirrels , only they had no tails , and she set them in a row at the foot of the bed and there were six of them all in a row and she made the most beautiful pictures on the wall , this little girl , and wait till you see them and when you hear them you 'll know what I mean . " Down the stairs , in the darkness , feeling barefoot for one step after another , and the voice ahead continuing , " And of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and they 're listeningtoo and they ca n't hear a thing because we talk so softly and they try and try to listen and we only whisper and you know this is the same little girl who came before and who comes all the time and she sleeps in my bed . " After they had gone down the stairs and turned , a door ahead of them showed light in the small space of its opening ; it was very late , because there was no other light from any room along the hall , and the hall and bathroom lights were turned out down here as well as upstairs . Natalie thought without wishing to at all of the cautious giggling thing that had gone soundlessly from one light to another , turning off each , for whatever dark reason , before coming unerringly in the dark to Natalie 's bed . " Here now , " the voice said , still with that flat giggling undertone , " now we can all listen together , and sit tight next to the wall and then we can hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh to put your hands over your mouth.  |p182Little  girl ? Little girl ? " It was a loving call and Natalie , waiting and held outside the lighted doorway , wanted to call too , " Little girl ? " Then , " She 's fallen asleep again , they 're always like that . Leave them for a minute and they 're gone asleep . Little girl ? Come on , we 've got to hurry . " She pulled Natalie violently in through the open doorway into the lighted room , and then closed the door very carefullybehind them . " Little girl ? " she said lovingly . The bed was rumpled and she went over , still calling , " Little girl ? " and giggling , and turned the blankets back , lifted the pillowand looked under it , and then , giggling , looked under the bed . " Little girl ? " she asked . " Little girl ? " Then , saying , " Come on , please hurry , we 'll never be able to hear a thing , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawers , pulling out the angora sweater , the real lace slip , and cartons of cigarettes and unassorted shoes , the money carelessly thrown inside . " Little girl ? " She turned to Natalie and said helplessly , " She was here a minute ago . I ca n't imagine where she went  --  I told her to wait for me . Look , she left her coat . " Natalie , staring at the jacket that had been reported stolen a week or so before , was still not able to speak . " Little girl ? Where do you suppose she went ? Little girl . " Natalie opened her mouth , still not knowing what she was going to say . " Well , come on , then , anyway , it will serve her right if we start without her , only remember they 're listening and do n't make a sound . Hold your hands over your mouth when you laugh and do n't run around the floor because they'rep183right outside , and they hear everything . Little girl ? Come on over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do what I do  --  anyone could tell you 've never been here before but we 'll excuse you this time and whatever you hear do n't make a sound because then they 'll hear you . Listen to her . . . she 's singing . " Very quietly , in acute fear , Natalie was backing to the door . When she felt the panels behind her back , she opened it without a perceptible sound , her hand behind her , and opening it still behind her , backed farther into the hall and closed the door in front of her face , shutting out all the light in the hall but feeling more at ease in the darkness ; she was on the first floor of the house , she knew , and up two flights of stairs  --  oh , interminable !  --  was her own room again and a safe light she might turn on . Backing away from the doorway , she stumbled over nothingand almost fell against the opposite wall . I must be very calm , she told herself ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own room in the dark , and if on the way I can find a light switch for anywhere , the halls , the stairs , the bathrooms , so much the better , and if I do not get frightenedand try to run I will not fall on the stairs , and if I do not fall on the stairs she will never hear that I have gone , and why does n't anyone wake up and come and help me ? Then , of course , she heard again , " Little girl ? " and the door opened and the light came out into the hall , and Natalie , turning to run in any direction , realized too late that she had come the wrong way and in the darkness was pursued by sly brushing footsteps not on the way to the stairs and her own room but on the way to the front door.  |p184In  the darkness , the light from the room left far behind her , she heard the soft giggle and felt almost the seeking hand brush her face and heard very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then mercifully she found the latch to the front door and it opened more easily than she had even prayed it would , and as it swung before her she thought , This will set off the burglar alarm , and almost laughed as she slammed it tight behind her . It was incredible and of course still a dream to be runningfreely and in her pajamas with the shameful blackand-redScotties on them , barefoot first over the gravel of the walk , and then primitively over the wet grass , and to be under the trees with everything dark around her . She thought then , I will go back when the sun is out and they are all awake and I can tell them about it , and then she thought she heard wailing from the house behind her , " Littlegirl ? " and knew a sudden horrible shock when , going across the grass under the trees she saw in the moonlight a figure coming toward her . Standing helplessly , thinking , Now , I can not run , this is the time , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " asked the girl Tony . Wednesday Madam : Unless you comply with the following conditions , and withoutfail , I shall have a black vengeance to wreak upon you : 1 . Enclosed find check for twenty-five dollars . ( That is a condition I deem it not overdifficult to meet. ) 2 . Cash this check . ( Any rich acquaintance will do. )  |p1853  . With the money thus secured , buy yourself a round-trip ticket to this place . ( Try the bus station for this. ) 4 . Pack a toothbrush , whatever books you need , a pencil and paper , and two chocolate bars in a small valise , put on your coat and hat , and go directly to the place where buses congregate . ( This is the most complicated of all , hut if you do these things one after another , in the order iii which I have stated them , you should have little or no trouble ; I recommend , however , that you do them in strict order ; it would be most unorthodox for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , and then try to pack your bag. ) 5 . Get on the first bus that will bring you here . ( Ask the driver , if you are puzzled , or , better still , pin a label on the lapel of your coat and he will see that you are de-livered . ) Meet these small conditions , sign my book in blood , and I shall turn over to you my key to all the treasures of this world , including , very possibly , some small amount of informationof John Milton ( 1608  --  74 ) and a cordial invitation to escort you , in person , to any and all future dances . Fail , as I say , to meet these my conditions , and upon you shall fall the wrath of one who has never yet feared to make his presence known . Did I remember to put in the check ? Yes . Good . Dad Sir : I hear and obey . Arrive Saturday afternoon 2:30 . Thanks for the check . Love , Nataliep186Tomorrow morning was Friday and biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desiring to get up at seven and yet have eight hours ' sleep should be at least ready for bed : teeth brushed , hair done , clothes for the morrow set out . And , leaning forward , her face terribly bright and alert and terribly terribly interested in what Arthur Langdon was saying , Natalie sought hopefully for a state of frozen unconsciousness , perhaps drunken , perhaps only the little swift precious moment that slipped her from a dull world into a bright one ; she nodded intelligently at what Arthur was saying , and thought , People have had heart attacks and died without realizing anything more than what is probably that brightly flashing second of knowing you are dead . Peoplehave managed to do it . " I 'm not at all sure what I really do believe , " Arthur was saying , and , " When you consider that art itself is a process of .. " Dearest , " said Elizabeth Langdon , who had almost overnight , it seemed , adopted a dogged persistence of displayed affection , and a hearty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give the impression that she and Arthur were still newlyweds and insanely in love , " dearest , could n't it be said , actually , that with reference to  --  oh dear , I sound so stupid  --  but anyway . . . " I could slip right away , Natalie thought . I could die here , with my eyes wide open and my mouth parted admiringly , and my glass poised in stunned admiration halfway to the chair arm ; I could die right here . Or I could pretend I was going to be sick and sneak off home to bed . Or I could even speak , say something so very unkind that they would all listen , and nod at me the way I nod at them.  | " Although , actually . . . " Arthur said . Ile frowned , weighinghis glass as well as his words , while his wife leaned forwardbreathlessly , and Natalie , embarrassed at having been thinking while other people were talking , closed her eyes briefly and said , " Someday someday somedav , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come round to the way of thinking that would . . . " Is something going to happen ? Natalie wondered . IIas he gone too far , and will someone be witty at his expense ? Oh dear , she thought , I wish I 'd been listening and watching , instead of closing my eyes ; something has led to somethingelse , and I 've missed the beginning and shall have to smile vacantly ; is something going to happen ? She thought sadly of how empty lives must be where something was not going to happen . No one seemed to be particularly witty at Arthur 's expense , and so whatever was going to happen was apparently still on its way , choosingits own moment , building for its own effect , so that it should be neither too soon nor too late , neither an anticlimaxnor a cause . Is it just that something is going to happen to me ? Nataliewondered . She closed her eyes again experimentally ; was she falling asleep while Arthur Langdon was talking and while the Langdons ' guests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listened with civility ? I shall walk out onto the porch , Natalie thought . As a penance for closing my eyes twice , I have been directed to stand up in my chair , dislodging the ashtraythat sits on the arm , I have been directed to move , trying to be unobtrusive but watched with gratitude by everyone in the room , I shall go to the door and someonep188will say , " Natalie ? " and I will turn around and smile vaguely and pass quietly through the doorway and out onto the porch . Later I shall find that I have to come back , and again , the only large movement in the room , I shall find everyone watching me while Arthur pauses in his sentence , regarding me thoughtfully and testing , in a fraction of a second , ways of using me as an example . " Take Natalie , now ; she has been gone , and come back , and did anyone ... ? " " If Natalie had not entered the room at that minute , then , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wearing light blue ; now , if we assume that the color we believeto be light blue . . . Now , she thought . I shall move now , but she did not . No one looked at her at the moment , and the thought of the strength required to draw every eye in the room to her direction wearied her for a moment , so that the order to her muscles to arise , counteracted halfway , brought her convulsivelyout of her chair in an abrupt movement that spilled the ashtray onto the floor . Then , while Arthur waited patiently in mid-paragraph , she collected the cigarettebutts and the burnt matches , thinking as she did so , Ungainly , awkward , clumsy  --  and she left the ashes . ElizabethLangdon watched her without expression ; she needs some more positive explanation of what I am doing , Nataliedecided , before she estimates it and decides on a reaction , particularly in this new personality of hers , which still does not fit her very well . Perhaps she wants to be angry at someone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could so easily be a good person for Elizabeth to hate , and also I am the only person now standing in this room , and Elizabeth is usually angry at the largest moving target ; Ar/thur can not mention me now because the course of his argumentis planned out for the next paragraph and it does not include me ; he is probably , however , going ahead with the other parts of his mind to construct a new paragraph for use when I come back . She set the ashtray back on the arm of the chair where she would be sure to knock it off again when she sat down after coming back , and threaded her way tactfully and gracelessly through the people sitting on the floor , excusing herself to those in chairs as though they were a higher order of being ; she avoided spilling a drink that sat on the floor , and stepped in an ashtray . Someone took advantage of her movement to begin a paragraph of his own . " On the other hand , " his voice began from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very true , you can hardly call it a complete picture of the problem . Take Kafka , for instance  --  I think you mentioned him as an example , and  --  " There were never any real silences in this conversation , except for the involuntary secret moment of dismay everyonefelt at seeing Natalie move ; these people  --  although there seemed to be so many of them , there were only nine or ten  --  all carried with them , seemingly , arguments of their own , arguments against the invisible , always-defeated antagonistwho mocked ineffectually from the darkness of the bedroom at night , the bathroom wall , the window beyond the typewriter . They all carried their arguments well , and spoke when they could , and laughed occasionally , and sometimesfound themselves in agreement with one another , althoughalways the mocking antagonist needed to be conqueredagain , and , conquered , returned , in the face in the mirror , the logs in the fire , with his ceaseless nagging.  | " I was just about to explain that point , " Arthur Langdon said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , we consider the whole question as one purely of . . . " Natalie sighed as she reached the small foyer , and found the door ahead , and the porch beyond , and the cool night air awaiting her ; with the door shut it was not possible to hear Arthur 's voice . The porch was actually only a miserable excuse for a place to sit ; it was no more than a step up or a step down , so that sitting on the porch steps at the Langdons ' house meant the knees under the chin and the feet awkwardly placed and the back twisted , but the same trees were outside , living in the ground without curiosity about the insides of houses , and growing toward death as surely as Natalie . When one tree demonstrated that it was not rooted and perhaps not completely indifferent by disengaging itself from the others and coming toward Natalie where she sat . on the porch step , she was not surprised  --  it was an odd night , anyway , and the day after tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said only , with some crossness , " I do n't want to talk . " " All right . " It was almost companionable , and Natalie without intentionmoved over on the narrow step to leave room . " It 's so cool out here , " she said . " Then you do want to talk ? " said the girl Tony . " They 're all talking , inside , " Natalie said . The girl Tony had not been invited within , Natalie knew wisely , and thought , She does n't care whether she sits on the steps of people who do n't invite her or whether she stands around with trees or whether she talks to me or not.  |p191She  knew she ought not to talk because she had said she was not going to and because she knew this calm girl Tony calmly expected her to do what she said she was going to , but she said anyway , " You were n't invited ? " " No . " " Would you go if you were invited ? " Natalie asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on where I was invited to go . " " This damn place , " Natalie said , " it always turns out not to have the things I want , after all . I get up inside and I knock over an ashtray and everyone looks at me and here I come rushing outdoors because I think it 's where I want to be , and then when I get out here it turns out to be the same old place I passed coming in . " " That 's because you came out the same door , " suggested Tony . She stood up , and Natalie thought quickly , She 's bored with me , and said , " You going away ? " " I 'll see you again , " Tony said . " Good night . " It was not pleasant sitting on the porch after Tony had gone ; a spot where two people have been talking , however briefly , is not after that a spot for one person to sit alone . Natalie got awkwardly to her feet and turned to go inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space was so small that they almost touched standing together , and Natalie crushed herself back against the door . " I came to look for you , " Elizabeth said . " I wanted to make sure you were all right . " How she would love to help her fallen sisters , Natalie thought . " I was all right , " she said . " I saw you with someone , " Elizabeth said.  |p192For  a minute Natalie was surprised at Elizabeth 's tone ; does she think I made an appointment with the girl Tony to meet her during Elizabeth 's party ? Natalie wondered ; does she think I intended to invite her inside ? or does she think we meet outside in the darkness , as though we had been outlawed from meeting in the light ? For a minute Natalie wanted poignantly to ask Elizabeth what she thought she had seen through the eyes which for Elizabeth registered what Elizabeth 's brain recorded , and then she said instead , " Let 's go back inside . " Arthur seemed hardly to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was saying , " It is not impossible to imagine a situation in which ... " Saturday morning Dear Dad , I 'm terribly sorry that I ca n't come home , and I 'm sorry too that this letter wo n't reach you in time . I would have called you except I did n't know until a little while ago that I could n't make it . You see , Arthur Langdon has given us this paper to do , and I 've simply got to get it in by Monday , so of course I ca n't come home , because the paper has to be very long and detailed and I 'll probably spend all weekend working on it . And even if I did come home , of course , I 'd have to work all the time . So I 'm really terribly sorry . By the way , you remember Tony ? The girl I wrote you about ? Well , I finally met her and I like her a lot . She lives in a house on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep193country just beyond the campus . I think she 's terribly interesting . Well , I 'm sorry about not being able to come home . I 'll keep enough money from the cheek for my train fare home at Thanksgiving . I 'm sure t can make it then . Hope Mother 's not disappointed . Give her nay love . NataliePerhaps  --  and this was her most persistent thought , the thought that stayed with her and came suddenly to trouble her at odd moments , and to comfort her  --  suppose , actually , she were not Natalie Waite , college girl , daughter to ArnoldWaite , a creature of deep lovely destiny ; suppose she were someone else ? Suppose , for instance , that all of this , from the day she could first remember ( running through the grass , calling , " Daddy ? Daddy ? " ) , suppose it had all been no more than a split second of time , as in a dream , perhaps under an anesthetic ; suppose that after this split second when her wanderingmind fancied she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up , bemused at first , and speaking thickly , and not really quite sure of her surroundingsand the nurse bending over her and the voices saying , " There now , it was n't so bad , was it ? " and suppose , waking , she should turn out to be someone else , someone real as Natalie was not ? An old woman , perhaps , with a year or so to live , or a child having its tonsils removed , or a woman with twelve children having a charity operation , or a man . And , waking , looking around the white room and at the clean nurse , she could say , " I had the funniest dream all this time ; I dreamed I was Waitalie Nat "  --  the dreamp194already fading , and not complete  --  and the nurse could easily say , " Everyone has dreams under ether , " moving capably forward with a thermometer . Or even suppose , imagine , could it be true ? that she was confined , locked away , pounding wildly against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the doctors , screaming down the corridors that she was someone named Watalie Naite . . . suppose , during the time she thought she was eating in the dining room and going unwillingly to classes and sitting in her room reading . . . suppose these things were not real ? Could it be that some sudden lucid horrible moment ( a new treatment , perhaps ? An inevitable return to actuality ? ) should show her brutally that the diningroom and the professors were not at all there , but existed far away in her mind , provoked into life only by her mania ? " I 'm not prepared today , " she could be saying to her music professor , and the doctor , turning back her eyelid to look at her cornea , would murmur , " How long has she been in this particular stage ? " But then , perhaps she was not dreaming , not mad , but alive and sound  --  living in this caught second of life only in the musing mind of some salesgirl or waitress or prostitute or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college named Naitalie Wat seemed romantic ; suppose somewhere a murderess slept lightly , dreaming for a minute that she was young again and had a life to live ; suppose that some minute , any minute , she should suddenly turn , move her head , speak strangely , and find herself not at all real ? It was this that made her write her name crazily on everything , knowing and yet forgetting that her books and her clothes and her written sheets of paper would be gonep195with Natalie Waite , were only part of a larger dream ; it was this which gave her the sudden sense , in conversation perhaps , that this particular portion of her dream might be condensed , only a fleeting shorthand scrap of words to be remembered later as a whole conversation ; it was this which brought her abruptly to a perception that if she were dreaming her room and her words , she might well be dreaming her world , and so when she awoke she might say , amused , to the nurse , to the girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen to what I dreamed ; I dreamed there was a war ; I dreamed there was a thing called television ; I dreamed  --  listen to this  --  that there was something called an atom bomb . An atom bomb  --  I do n't know ; I tell you I dreamed it . " Beyond this sense , however , of swift transient passage , was the worse , the frightful , conviction , of perhaps being in reality no more than Natalie Waite , college girl , daughter to Arnold , and unable to brush away the solidity of this world but forced to deal with it as actual and dreary . Yet then  --  why , if this were true , the sudden sharp sympathetic picture of the white walls and the nurse coming closer ? Why the graphically remembered room with the iron bedstead , the sure knowledge of the moment to slip the poison into the cup , the remembered pain ? Why , above all , the constant unusual shock of the sound of her own name said aloud ?  |p196IT  MUST be assumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the college , dark and drowsy under Natalie 's absence , and that at another point , known as here , was the home where her mother and father and brother lived , and to which she had been brought during a passage of time that in retrospect seemed nothing , so that her transition from there to here seemed no more than a fading in of one place upon another , a travel between points in time rather than in space . When her father met her at the bus stop late on Wednesdaynight Natalie was embarrassed , thinking of the seventy-five days , the ten and a half weeks , the two and a third months , since she had seen him or her mother or her brother or her home ; he did not look different in that he still as always resembled the various pictures of him in so many different places , but before he had a chance to speak to her , Natalie said quickly , " I 've got to go back on Friday  --  " before he had a chance , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and he , after a long and surprisedlook , nodded and said , " It 's nice to see you again . "  |p197Once  in the car , she asked , " IIow is Motluer ? " " Fine , " he said . " And Bud ? " " Fine . " " You look well . " " I am , thanks , quite well . " Natalie thought then , He expects some embarrassment ; he expects to even it off when we can sit and talk as usual . " How is everything ? " she asked . " Much the same . " " I 'm sorry I could n't come home before . " This was such an extraordinary statement that he obviouslyfelt it impossible to answer . It was strange being close to him again in the car , just as they had been many times before , when for so long ( seventy-five days , for instance ) he had been a signature on a letter , a name she had used speaking to people , no more than the absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked to console him . " Very well , thank you , " he said . On the bus , in the hour and a half it took her to reach the bus stop where he met her , Natalie had conscientiously tried to plan out a suitable greeting for him . A theatrical " Daddy ! " shouted while throwing herself into his arms was probably undesirable , considering that Mr. Waite could most likely not be counted on to stand agreeably and catch daughters hurling themselves at his head ; no more could she consider seriously a brief handshake and a meaningful look , a caught breath , and a murmured " Father " ; her favorite greeting , which she saw vaguely as taking up and carrying on a conversation as though they had just left it off ; was im/possible because she could not think how to start a conversationwhich might not have been finished ; not , at least , a conversation with her father , who might leave many things undone but never a word unsaid . Because she had not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus , what had happened was what she had never stopped to consider , which is that her father  --  perhaps phrasing impossible greetings in his own mind while drivingto the bus stop  --  had not quite settled on his own plan of action and had with wisdom apparently decided to pass over the whole question of greeting as a useless civility and one only to be regretted later , and had decided to do his real receiving of Natalie at some more appropriate time . When Natalie stepped down from the bus and recognized her father , with an unfilial shock of dismay , she stood and he stood , and then she said , not at all truthfully until she heard herself saying it , " I have to go back on Friday . " " I 'm sorry I have to go back on Friday , " she said again in the ear . " Your mother will be disappointed , " he said dryly . " How is Mother ? " " Very well , thank you . " The driveway to her own house came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable in recognizing , with a satisfactory feeling of difference , the old landmarks , and looking with the pride of new places on the stay-at-home grass and trees and flowers , and regarding with contempt the former narrow boundaries of her world . " It 's good to be home , " she said inadequately ; unbelievablewould perhaps have been a better word , or stupefying.  |p199Greeting  her mother was no problem at all ; for a minute the air was so full of Natalie 's appearance , her probable health , her shocking clothes , that there was no need for anyone to answer until her mother , accustomed again to Natalie after three minutes , subsided into her usual civil silence ; Natalie and her brother greeted one another with false cordiality and endeavored heartily not to speak again to one another past necessity . It was by then ten o'clock in the evening , and all four of them realized at once that they had from then on an eveningof sorts to get through ; they traditionally stayed up late , and tonight was a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other plans because Natalie was coming home , and Natalie herself had avoided appointments in order to come , and then , once Natalie had come and had turned out to be very little more entertaining or novel than the Natalie who had left seventy-five days before , there was nothing left to do except carry on the sort of formal conversation suited to the formal sort of guest Natalie had become . Seventy-five days before , not one of them would have thought it necessary to address her unless they wanted to , but now it was almost obligatory to assure her warmly of the fact that she was always welcome in her own home  --  always welcome , with the clear implication that she was thus always a visitor there . As a result Mrs. Waite exerted herself to say , " I have a twenty-pound turkey for tomorrow , Natalie . " All such remarksas this were , too , directed pointedly and almost accusinglyat Natalie by the addition of her name . " Biggest turkey I could get . " " Fine , " Natalie said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's been a long time since I 've had a good meal . " " How are the college meals ? " Mrs. Waite asked eagerly . " Terrible , " Natalie said , trying to remember the college meals . " How do you like it there ? " her brother asked , making a supreme effort . " Fine , " Natalie assured him earnestly . " I think it 's fine . How is your school ? " " Oh , fine , " he said . " Fine . " " Well , " Mrs. Waite said fondly , and sighed , surveying her family circle . " All home again at last , and all together . " " Studying hard ? " Natalie asked her brother hastily . " No harder than I have to , " he said , and everyone smiled . " And Arthur Langdon ? " asked Mr. Waite , who was not immune to the general convulsive emotional quality of the hour . " How is he ? " Natalie , who had been full of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I have n't seen much of him lately . " " Been working pretty hard , I guess , " her father said . Too late , because she was out of practice , Natalie found the irony in his voice , but she had already answered too carefully , " Well , not as hard as I should . " " How about we all have some coffee and cake ? " Mrs. Waite asked , looking brightly around at all of them . " Thank you , " Natalie said politely . They filed out into the kitchen , using their tenuous family relationship as an excuse for not having cake brought to them in the living room , but each one waiting civilly for the others to go through doors first.  | " It is so good to have my little girl back home again , " Mrs. Waite whispered when she said good night to Natalie . At the college on Thanksgiving Day they had turkey and cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes and peas and mince pie and small candies in paper baskets ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes and peas and mince pie and small candies in Mrs. Waite 's best silver candy dishes . Except for the fact that if she had been at the college she would not have eaten at all , Natalie found being at home not much better . The Thanksgiving dinner was one prepared solely and lovinglyby Mrs. Waite , tended and planned and rich in delicatetouches , and was eaten by her family in ill humor and weariness ; as though , in fact , it were an ordinary meal . It was served at three on Thursday afternoon , a time when no one was ordinarily hungry , and was preceded by cocktails , a ceremony which made Natalie and her brother stare at one another , since neither of them was quite prepared for the immoral spectacle of the other 's drinking in the bosom of the family . " Taken up liquor in your old age , Nat ? " Bud asked Natalie , and she answered him childishly , " What about you ? Keep a bottle under your pillow ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , pleased to see her two children talking together as though , she seemed to think , they were not brother and sisterat all . The two children , suddenly aware of this , fell immediately silent , and Mrs. Waite said brightly , " Well , all together again . We must drink a toast to our own little family . "  |p202Mr  . Waite regarded his wife without expression for a minute , and then lifted his glass and said solemnly , " To our own little family . " Looking around , at her tall daughter and her masculine son , at her husband , at her full dinner table , Mrs. Waite said meltingly , " Where will we all be next year ? " " Dead , perhaps ? " Mr. Waite suggested helpfully . " Do n't say that , " Mrs. Waite told him , " I do n't even like to talk about it . " " Let us flatter ourselves , " Mr. Waite said into his glass , " that I may be the survivor . " On Friday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing until the last minute that he awaited her in the study , she was only reminded of it by her mother 's fearful grimaces and gestures . As a result , when she knocked at the door and heard him say , pleased , " Come in , " she felt that she had an unworthy advantage of him in that he would be humiliated if he knew that she had forgotten when he remembered . She grinned at him when she closed the door behind her and said , " This is what I 've been waiting for . " " Natalie , my dear , " he said , and smiled back at her across the desk . This was his real greeting ; neither the encounter at the bus nor the toast before the Thanksgiving dinner were communications to Natalie from her father ; it was when he looked at her across his desk and saw the door shut behind her that he recognized her at last . " Well , " she said , and sat down . " Well , Natalie , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father looking down at his hands on the desk , and Natalie knowingp203with pleasure the feeling of the study , of the books , of her father , and hearing faintly an echo which maul ( ' her almost smile ( " What if I told you that you were seen ? " ) ; after a minute she said , " Did I write you about Arthur 1 , angdon ? " " No , " he said , his voice quiet so as not to disturb her possiblerevelations , " what about him ? " " I keep thinking of the time I went to see hint iu his office and it reminded me of coming in here to talk to you , and he made such a fool of himself . " " And I ? " Natalie laughed . " I 'm really glad to be back , " she said . " It 's hard to say it , though . " " Is everything going well ? " " No , " Natalie said , considering . " Not at all well , I guess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In everything . " " Anything you need from me ? " " No , not right now . Later , perhaps . " " Can you tell me about it ? " This is not going right , Natalie thought ; how much he wants to know , and what shall I tell him ? Daddy dear , I am a failure , I hate college and I hate everybody ? Or is that just what he expects ? Does he have an answer for that , even ? " I 'll tell you when I can , " she said . " Right , " he said . " Working ? " Funny , Natalie thought , when anyone else says , " Working ? " it means are you getting anything done , really  --  are you going to classes , passing your exams , finishing your biologynotebook , have you got a job , is the plumbing businessp204picking up any , is there a spot for you in a new Broadway production , are you earning any money ? When my father and Arthur Langdon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening inside you that might possibly interest them , like yeast working in bread . " Sure , " she said . There was a short pause , and then her father said gracefully , " I am not so great a fool myself , Natalie , but what I can recognize foolishness in others . I can still remember the almost irresistible impulses toward melodrama which strike one at your age . Please forgive me if I say that I never expected you to be immune to ordinary impulses , although I expect equally that you will be receptive to extraordinary ones . I do , however , feel that you might reserve your sardonic impulses for your mother , perhaps , or for your friends at college , without trying them out on me . I have  --  please understand me , my dear  --  too much trouble with my own adolescent hangovers , to feel yours very deeply . This attitude of yours is one requiring only a slight , although basic , change in viewpoint to become a valuable and constructive state of mind , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may become a profitable member of society . There is  --  and please believe me  --  no vital change in personality involved . There is , as a matter of fact , not even any pain . You have only to shift perhaps a quarter turn to the northeast , and your problems are gone . Perhaps nothing more is required than one clear view of your situation and your present actions ; it is very possible , you know , to be doing the right things and thinkingthe perfect thoughts for one 's position , and yet seem entirely wrong because that one faint shading of understandingis missing ; perhaps you feel that you are doing badlyp205these days because you do not perceive that you are , in fact , doing very well indeed , and only lack the perception of your own worth to know exactly hen ' well . Perhaps , Natalie , if I remind you what a very worthwhile person you are , it will give you the quarter turn you need . " " Nothing will help , " Natalie said ; even alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help saying it , althoughshe did not look at him as she spoke . " Well , " he said , after a minute , " I had not intended saying these things to you so soon , certainly not on your first visit home . It is of course necessary to achieve a certain solidity in one 's way before taking a shift in perspective to see it clearly . I daresay that by the time I see you again  --  since , as you say so emphatically , you must go back today  --  youmay be readier to listen to me . I should hate to deprive you prematurely of the glories of the suicidal frame of mind , since I am fairly certain that depriving yourself of the ability to feel this way would be more cruel than any sort of physical torture you might inflict upon yourself , so that I can use suicidal ' as a descriptive adjective without really feeling that it implies any action . " " You 're trying to make me say that I want to kill myself , " Natalie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said tartly , " and I would vastly prefer that you confine your statements to pure descriptions of fact . I think better of your vanity , Natalie , than to believe that two months out of seventeen years could destroy you . " She was almost irresistibly tempted to tell him all about herself , to justify somehow the facts of herself that he did not seem to understand , and which , so horribly acute to her ,  |p206seemed  to him only to point up a statement about general personalities ; she wanted to pound on the desk before him and shout , " What do you know ? " walk wildly up and down the room , pulling words from the very air to tell him about herself , and she wanted to shout , and to stamp , and to cry , and yet before she had time to do any of these things she heard ahead of her his calm voice saying , when she had done , " Precisely , my dear Natalie , precisely what I was . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " I hardly blame them , " he said briefly . When she saw that he was laughing she laughed too , and as he stood up to show her it was time to go , that he had no more , really , to say to her , he added , " I think we understandone another , Natalie , you and I. " She had come home on Wednesday night , bringing with her a certain sense of romance , as one who could bring heartbreaking stories of haunted lands , who had seen and heard and touched and known the improbable , the unbelievable ( " and in that country I saw as well an image , made of a virgin pearl , and its eyes were diamonds and its hair was beaten gold , and it was set on a block of marble and no one might worship it face to face . . . " ) and brought back perhaps small odd things , dug from the bottom of a trunk and mused over , held in two hands lovingly .. . ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they said it would bring death to any who touched it . . . and this , there 's a story goes with this one  --  I was lost , and wandering in the jungle , and it had been three days since I had eaten , and six weeks since I had seen a human being , and when I awakened , raging with fever , I saw bendingp207over me . . . and , then , look at this , observe the intricate carving , the cipher scratched on the handle -- I bought it from an old . . . " ) . . . who had seen and heard and touched and known more than might ever 1w found at home . Who had seen , perhaps , beasts walking like men and jewels shining like stars , and who smiled at certain rememberedscenes a million miles away , and stared bewildered at old familiar sights and found the faces of mother and father and brother more strange than the face on a carving made in pearl . Natalie had not been at home for more than twenty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her purposes served ; she had slept once more in the bed politelycalled hers , she had kissed her mother and father and been mildly surprised by the actuality of her brother , she had tried out the familiar things and found that she rememberedthem well enough , then it was time for her to be off again . It had rained steadily since she first set out for the bus stop at college , and the damp unkind weather filled the rooms at home with gray cold ; she had worn her raincoat home from college and although she had not gone out of the house since , the raincoat still lay across a chair in the back hall crumpled and wet , the floor beneath it muddy where it had dripped all night . Two days before the living-room fire had dried Natalie out , but even the memory of the rain to be waded through , like a dark impenetrable barrier , before she could be again at college , would not dampen her urgent excitement or soothe her . " So you 're not staying for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , and the question was a statement about Natalie 's unquiet eyes , herp208spot before the fire , her hands moving beside her on the rug . And the question was as well a continuation of her mother 's welcome to Natalie on Wednesday evening , meaninglessand full of incoherent dread ; if her mother had said , " Will you stay on , then , for dinner tonight ? " Natalie would have turned quickly and perhaps answered without the constantfearful check she had been keeping upon herself at home , would perhaps have answered , an answer being required , with the sublime impatience which had possessed her while she was with her family these days . If her mother had asked her any question at all , anything to make Natalie speak , the whole quiet forward movement of the day could easily have been impeded , the extra moments consumed might have made Natalie later at the college , and so in some way deprived of something , her mother might have had her answer and not have been the better for it . Stirring uneasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother had spoken , " I 'd better get on back . " She knew that behind her , her mother had set her needle down soundlessly in the cloth and was resting her hands on the arms of the chair , staring over Natalie 's head into the fire ; Natalie felt rather than heard her mother draw breath to speak , and then resign it . No point in speaking , no reasonablething to say . It had all been debated endlessly in the second between her mother 's drawn-in breath and Natalie 's involuntary movement that checked it . Her mother had almost said , " Natalie , are you happy ? " and Natalie had almostsaid , " No " ; her mother had almost said , " Everything seems somehow to go badly , " and Natalie had almost said , " I know it and I ca n't help it " ; her mother had almost said , " Let me help you , " and Natalie had almost said , " What canp209you do ? " and that had been the nervous nurvenuent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had silencedher before she ever spoke . After a while , at work with her needle again , Nirs . Waite said , as though they had been discussing lesser matters all the afternoon , " Dear , are you trying to settle down to work ? " " Sure , " said Natalie , because this kind of spoken conversationcould be carried on easily without thinking , or truth . " I 've told you this before , " her mother said , and her voice added , so many , many times , " I 've said it before , Natalie , and you know I hate to keep dwelling on it  --  but you do know that the money sending you to college is really more than your father can afford . We have deprived ourselves of many things . " Natalie perceived that she was supposed to come to her mother in gratitude , as she had been invited to do many times before , so that between them they might make many false promises , and sketch out brilliant unreal futures , and console one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not learned how to come to her mother in gratitude , and so she merely turned her head and said , " I know it , and I do remember it . I 'll try to keep out of trouble . " " Not trouble , " her mother said , as though trouble were murder or robbery or arson , something she could understand and possibly find among her own temptations , " not trouble , Natalie ; just try to do better with your studies and with the other girls and even with your professors . " Strange , Natalie thought , in all his wisdom my father never found from my letters that I get along badly withp210people ; I suppose it 's the first thing my mother fears , just as she is afraid that I have been visited with all her sorrows , because those she is better able to heal in me than she could in herself . It seemed that perhaps her father was trying to cure his failures in Natalie , and her mother was perhaps trying to avoid , through Natalie , doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken . " Everything 's really fine , " Natalie said to her mother . " I 'm really doing very well . Everyone says so . " She decided that this last statement smacked too much of eagerness , and turned her head back abruptly to stare again into the fire . " I have n't told your father , " her mother said surprisingly . " You have n't ? " It was the weak , the completely wrong and unnecessary thing to say , but for the moment Natalie was not able to think of any right thing . Her mother was silent for a minute , perhaps to give Natalie a chance to say something intelligent , and then with a little rustling sound she folded up her sewing . The small sounds of her mother 's breathing nearly put Natalie , suspended in the silence her mother did not seem inclined to break , to sleep before the fire , but the realization that her father and brother would soon be home prevented her from relaxing completely . Beforethey came back she must have her coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , ready for farewells ; she hoped that her father would not want to drive her to the bus stop , and was resigned at the same time to the fact that he would not possibly allow her to take a taxi , or , better still , to walk . " Natalie ? " her mother said helplessly , looking at the back of Natalie 's head , and as if her mother had been warning her , Natalie rose effortlessly , proud of the swift , movementsp211of her own long body . " You 're getting . so big , " her mother murmured . " I can hardly recognize my little girl . " " Better get ready to go , " Natalie said hastily , moving toward the door and twisting involuntarily as she went past her mother , as though to avoid clutching hands . " tills leaves at four . " Her mother started to speak again , but Natalie hurried , and could safely pretend not to hear by the time her mother was ready to say anything . The wet raincoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional smells of the college , a faint echo of a cologne Natalie had never worn in her life ; near the pocket was a cigarette burn she had not made ; the raincoat was in itself a symbol of going and coming , of wishing and fearing , or , precisely , the going out of a warm , firelit house into the heartbreaking cold . She tied a scarf over her head and thought that now she would not be able to hear her mother 's last admonitions ; when she went back to the fire her mother had risen and was standing where Natalie had been lying , and her father stood next to her mother by the fire . I did n't hear him come in , Natalie thought , and thought again , I suppose by now I 'm out of practice on his coming and going ; he and her brother had been to call on people she did not even know , and although they had asked her to go along , she had been able to decline without minding very much ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home was , after all , so much time wasted . An uncomfortable thing happened : her father spoke and for a minute Natalie thought it was her mother . " Well , my dear , " he said and again the conversation between him andp212her mother while Natalie was getting her raincoat became suddenly explicit ; he had not believed that his wife was letting Natalie go , had perhaps been surprised at the exertionnecessary to keep Natalie , had wondered over and abandoned as unworthy the notion of himself asking her to stay , had been then incredulous that his wife should ever have expected Natalie not to go . " Did you have a nice time ? " asked Natalie formally . Her father bowed ironically . " No better than I expected , " he said . " I believe we keep better company at home . " " We have been very quiet here , " Natalie said . She went over and put her arms around her mother ; a little of this affection was surely not out of place at leave-taking , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until this moment her going had been no more than a wanton impulse , but of course saluting her mother made it definite , and her father stirred , moving the car keys in his pocket . " Bus at four ? " he asked . " Better get going , " Natalie said , disengaging herself easily from her mother and stepping back to nod at her brother , who nodded back and said , " See you sometime . " Natalie and her mother and father stood then uncertainly together in the middle of the room , each of them with something to say to the others ( " Will it always be the same ? " " Will we any of us change by the next time ? " " Has it always been like this ? " ) , and involved themselves in a sort of dance , maneuvering one another into the most favorableposition for a gesture whose extreme simplicity , that of departure , had become a sudden awkward thing . Natalie , finally , moved first . She found that as she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as though to confirmher going , and that her father , following her , was still rattling the car keys in his pocket . " Gooclbve , " Natalie said at last , actually hesitating again in the doorway , looking beyond the solid coated figure of her father , past the 1'T ( 'etantfigure of her mother , to her own spot by the fire , tmtenantedand probably of no interest to tuwone save herself , to remain empty of her until the next time , still optimistic , that she came home . " Goodbye , " she said again , directly to her mother , and went outside into the rain . Once in the car with her father , but out- in the rain nevertheless , she looked with interest on the street light at the corner , ornate and suburban , belonging undeniably to the home where her mother and father lived , and she saw with satisfaction the rain slanting brightly against the light ; it was already dark on this rainy afternoon and this was the last outpost belonging to her father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less the exclusive property of her father , more the potential shining world of her own . " Seems like I hardly had a chance to say hello , " she said politely to her father , her voice warm with the excitement of leaving . " I expect you 'll be home again , " her father said . " In any case we have heard you say hello in the past . " " Has Mother really been well ? " Natalie asked . " Very well , thank you . Very well indeed . " Once in the bus , cradled in the deep heavy seat , her father waved away through the thick window , the movement of great wheels under her , her family behind and the college ahead , Natalie leaned back comfortably ; there wasp214no time now for remorse over the perfunctory way she had treated her loving mother and father and even her brother  --  what was important at this moment was the quick control of muscles all up and down her leg , bent now , but potentiallystraight , the narrow solidity of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unity that began with her eyes . and forehead and tied to her back and into her legs again , all of it bound together into a provocative whole that could be only barely contained within the skin and sense of NatalieWaite , individual . She wanted to sing and did so , soundlessly , her mouth against the fogged window of the bus , thinking as she sang , And . when I first saw Natalie Waite , the most incredible personality of our time , the unbelievably talented , vivid , almost girlish creature  --  when I first saw her , she was sitting in a bus , exactly as I or you might be , and for a minute I noticed nothing of her richness . . . and then she turned and smiled at me . Now , knowing her for what she is , the most vividly talented actress ( murderess ? courtesan ? dancer ? ) of our time or perhaps any time , I can see more clearly the enchanting contradictions within her  --  her humor , her vicious flashing temper , so easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her world-weary cynicism ( she has , after all , suffered more than perhaps any other from the stings and arrows of outrageous fortune ) , her youthful vitality ; her inability to tell the straight truth , her brutal honesty with herself ; her rich , her uncatalogued , her magnificent mind , so full of information , of deep pockets never explored wherein lie glowing thoughts like jewels never seen . . . She thought too of worlds that lay ahead for Nataliep215Waite , and tried to estimate them by a secret formula of her own : one hundred , for instance  --  one hundred years , one hundred dollars  --  was a summit which had achieved and passed unachievable and unpassable reaches like fifty-nines and seventy-fours ; seventy-four is , after all , a point so vastly beyond one , or two , and even beyond three ; the month of May ( reflecting further , Natalie thought that she had never in her life lived through the month of May ; it was a fable , a month not-existing , a month for maying and greenswarding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probablyTuesdays and Sundays like any other month ) was something that might or might not happen long after the unthinkable barriers of January and March and Valentine 's Day and Lincoln 's Birthday had been gotten past somehow . Before her , then , lay a hundred years , each one gleefully passing without hesitation seventy-four and February , and perhaps a hundred Mays , each one to be welcomed and duly decked . A vague and voiceless yearning filled her , to take these days and force them to solid rich tangible form , to hammer at this foolishness of time and make it into . . . into . . . She fell asleep here , and slept until the bus stop before the college stop , when , complimenting herself upon her unerring accuracy and supernatural sense of time , she awoke and recognized where she was . In the regular and offensively straight line of windows across the third floor of the house where she lived at college , Natalie found the one dark one which was her own , and a little thrill of anticipation followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark window was her own sure place , and she had been away from it . Shep216lingered going up the walk , prolonging the last few minutes before she entered . When she opened the door of the house and came into the hallway where the mail pigeon-holes dominated the graceful lines copied approximately from an eighteenth-centurytown house , the peculiar atmosphere she had somehowforgotten in two days swept down on her and left her almost breathless for a minute . First , and overpoweringly , there was the smell of the cheap dark wood used for the furniture , and the smell of the noon 's soup from the kitchen  --  it was a student joke that the furniture polish and the soup were made from the same basic substance  --  and then , strongly reminiscent of the furniture polish and a little of the soup , was the scent Old Nick , who had rooms on the first floor of the house , used on herself , her room , and her clothes . This scent swept up the hall from Old Nick 's apartment halfway to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls even of the third floor , identifying the transoms where Old Nick listened , clinging to the doorknobsshe touched , a stronger and more pervasive influence than any of Old Nick 's advisory remarks . From where she stood in the eighteenth-century foyer Natalie could see , on her right , the hall that led to the diningroom , past the half-open door to Old Nick 's rooms  --  this doorway , by the way , was subject , due to its nearness to the kitchen fires and the fact that it was inhabited by Old Nick and the additional fact that it was on the bottom floor , to a series of student jokes Old Nick had undoubtedly heard and probably fostered  --  and the long row of slim doorways on the eighteenth-century wallpaper , opening onto nothing.  |p217On  Natalie 's left were the stairs , curving up and over her head and going past the rooms on the second floor and going past the rooms on the third floor  --  on the third floor was Natalie 's room , and it only took mounting the stairs to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her left , lay the living room where she had been called iilxni to name herself her first night in college , a room she had enteredperhaps twice since , although there were girls iii the house who used it regularly , as though it were their own . There was no one in sight , but from beyond the door to Old Nick 's rooms came the sound of voices , in the tones of two old friends complimenting one another and drinking sherry before dinner . Natalie , her moccasins making no sound on the linoleum floor that duplicated the black-andwhitetiles of an eighteenth-century entrance hall , went to her mailbox , but it was empty ; without looking into any other , she turned abruptly and was about to start up the stairs when she was caught , helplessly and suddenly , by the sound of the dinner bell and the lunatic rush of the girls down the stairs . Rather than be trapped halfway up the stairs she retreated quickly , annoyed at herself for not havingtimed things better ; she started down the hall but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's door and Old Nick 's large voice urging her friend into the dining room . Natalie moved toward the front door and stood finally in the shadows under the stairs , listening to the pounding feet coming down over her head . Their voices were shrill and excited ; you would have imagined , Natalie thought with disgust , that it was worthwhile getting to dinner , the way they ran . After a minute or so the footsteps began top218slacken off , and the burden of the voices swelled from the dining room . There was a polite rattle of silverware and a constant urging questioning to the voices , as of three hundredgirls together asking one another , " What 's for dinner ? " When the last footsteps were gone from the stairs , Nataliecame out of the shadows and went quickly past the open hall to the stairs . No one had noticed her , seemingly . The last time she had gone into the dining room she had been shy , and had come in alone and sat down at a table near the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited , watching her until she sat down , her napkin. in her lap ; then they had risen , all three , and had gone without gesture to another table . Dinner in itself was no temptation to Natalie  --  there was no food in the world could get her into that dining room again . She went upstairs quickly , her wet feet soundless on the linoleum steps . She did not hesitate , but went directly upstairs and ran down the hall to her own room ; she always carried the key with her instead of leaving it in her manboxas she had been told to do , in case Old Nick wanted to come into her room , and had lost her passkey and could not find the maids and for some reason was not able to get one of the master keys from the main college office and could not locate any of the other girls  --  the ones who lived in seventeen , or thirty-seven , or seven  --  whose keys would open Natalie 's door . Inside , the room was hot and airless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor and went over to the bed , which was pushed hard against the window . She sat on the bed , opened the window and , dropping her head onto the windowsill , rested quietly with her eyes closed.  |p219There  were noises again in the hall before she felt refreshedand could lift her head ; the girls were coining up from dinner and the dark night air had filled the room ; she could see her desk and her typewriter in the cliouness , the line of books all around the room next to the baseboard , the one straight chair next to the desk . One night , in a fury at not being able to turn freely in her own room , she had taken her clothes from the dresser and crushed therm into the suitcases in her closet , and shoved and tugged the dresser out into the hall , along with the maple armchair and the bookcase the college provided . The college handy man had been petulant about the furniture in the hall , but eventually it had been taken away and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and chair crammed into a corner and her door eternally locked and  --  this was a month-old whim , which no longer surprised her by its convenience  --  herwastebasket hanging just outside the window by a string fastened to the head of the bed , was able to move about in her small square room undisturbed . It was necessary , of course , to keep the transom shut always , and the key securely in the keyhole while she was inside the room . She was very lonely here . So much so , in fact , that tonightafter a few minutes when the sounds in the hall had quieted down , she found a cigarette in the pocket of her raincoat and holding it in her hand unlocked the door cautiously and went out into the hall . There were voices coming from lighted rooms farther down the hall ; several doors were open , giving a sense of girls running in and out , from one room to another , so that Natalie slipped softly to the stairs and down them to the first floor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible in the shadows , she knocked as though her knock were distinguishablefrom all others , and waited . After a moment spent crushed against the doorway , staring into the panels of the door and wondering at them , she thought she heard , " Come in , " and she opened the door and slipped inside , shutting the door quickly behind her . " Hello , " she said . " Yes ? " said Rosalind . She was lying on her bed holding a movie magazine and she looked up in polite surprise . Natalie , looking at the bright-orange pajamas Rosalind was wearing , thought that these days Rosalind was gay in the center of a group , admired and appreciated , one of the girls whom other girls wanted to meet ; so small a change , Natalie thought , so slight a variant ; all she would ever remembersomeday of Rosalind , she knew , was the quick bright picture of Rosalind walking down a campus path with a girl on either side of her ; " Yes ? " said Rosalind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie asked ; she kept her voice light , as though the request were trivial . " Certainly , " Rosalind said . She tossed over the book of matches that lay on the table next to the bed , and added , " Keep them , I have plenty . " Without looking again at Natalie , she raised her magazine expectantly . " Mind if I stay and talk for a minute ? " Natalie asked , as though this request , too , were trivial . " You busy ? " she asked . " I do n't want to interrupt . " " Well , I was reading , " Rosalind said , and glanced down at her magazine . " Of course , " Natalie said . She was thinking , I know , I know , I 'm the only one who knows , and she is n't a bitp221afraid of me , and I could tell if I wanted to and she does n't believe anyone would listen , but I know . She stumbled in her hurry to be out of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soberly that it was two flights of stairs back to her room and so little space to cover before she was outside , and she knew where she was going even before  --  with a gesture of contempt she wished she had been able to do two minutes before  --  she tore Rosalind 's matchbook in two and threw it on the floor outside Rosalind 's door . The door of her room upstairs was locked , because she locked it even if she went ten paces out into the hall . She had cigarettes with her , and her own matches , although her raincoat was still in her room . Movinglightly , without sound , she ran swiftly down the stairs and out onto the campus , stepping with gratitude onto the grass . The rain had stopped , but gave every sign of continuing after a breathing spell . Drops of water slid off the trees onto Natalie 's hair and although she wished she had brought her raincoat the thought of going after it , back into the lighted house , was untenable . Long before this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now how to find her way along the campus paths almost without looking , and the thought of the taut lighted square of her room behind her was disgusting , out here where she was able to take long steps and move as far as she wanted . Ahead of her she could see lights in the Langdons ' home , and there were voices coming indistinguishably from the houses she passed , and somewhere a radio ; although she could not have identified the tune it was playing , she could have narrowedthe possibilities down to half a dozen tunes she heardp222girls whistling in the halls or singing in harmony in their rooms . She was now the owner of this land , and as she turned to go along the narrow path that would take her behind the main lecture buildings and around again to the campus houses , she thought , I am walking around my country , I am telling its boundaries , describing its edges , enclosing it . The beautiful clarity of all marked outlines occurred to her  --  there would be a deep satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside of a strong fence enclosing a large land , leaning outward to push toward the extreme limit of property ; too , what about the lovely definition of a sheet of white paper alone on her desk , oblong and complete , the tightness with which the sky fitted onto the earth at the horizon , the act of caressing the spine of a book ? Irresistibly , she thought with a shiver of a razor-sharp edge slicing horizontally through her eyes , into her mouth , and then , coming around the hard corner of a building , saw again the campus and its lights and heard its sounds . She stopped for a minute , surveying her country with interest and with tolerance ; she was infinitely tall and these tiny buildings  --  although scaled to exact measurements : a tenth of an inch , perhaps , to a foot  --  had been set up by her own hands , furnished , and peopled with the small moveable dolls she had herself created , planning with care and perhaps not entirely wisely the numbers of their arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , she thought , when it is light , I shall consider moving all the trees together to make a real forest at one end of the campus . It might on the whole be better to take the houses out of two straight lines facing one **25;5739;TOOLONG . The machines , the type , the paper , the desks and chairs , and one of us is still here to get the paper out on schedule . Welcome , though I wish I could say we had come to a better time . Our story is the same . Fewer and fewer readers year by year . They are dying . Almost no writers at all , for a writer must have readers . We have even become resigned . That is a good thing , or a bad thing , depending on what your thinkingis . Your father sat in this chair at this machine . He worked here , as I work . He got the paper out twice a week , as I do . I remember you as a boy coming here to watch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a wonderful place , a place of words , of print and paper . I was then only a contributor , unpaid . " " I remember you , " Rock said , for as the man had spoken , slowly and with many sighs of despair and amusement , Rock had seen him again , tall , lean , hard , swift of eye and speech , his moustache then broad and black , a man with a shouting voice and a roaring laugh . " You have come here to remember your father , " the editor said . " Your coming gives me joy , for I am part of your father , all that is here is part of him . What is the paper we get out ? What is it for ? What is it supposed to do ? What do we mean by going to so much trouble twice a week year in and year out ? Well , we have our language , and it is a good one . Had we also half a dozen writers it could become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have also fewer and fewer writers , but even these few writers have hearts that are no longer alive as they once were . Even so , twice a week the language must appear , and that is what we mean by going to the trouble . I am delighted to see you . Will you have a drink ? "  |p101As  he had spoken he had walked , moving among the machines , and he had come to a bottle with a liquid in it that might have been water , which they knew was not water but rakhi . The editor removed the cork and handed the bottle to Rock , who lifted it to the man and said , " To you , sir . " Rock took a swig and handed the bottle to Haig , who lifted it and said , " To you and the language , sir , " and drank . Haig handed the bottle to the man , who lifted it to both of them and said , " To the Armenians , whoever they are , and to their language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be forever . " He drank and handed the bottle back to Rock , saying , " Again , please . " " To my father , " Rock said . " To my mother , " Haig said . " To those , " the man said . " And to those who are dear to me , and dead . " They went to the editor 's study where the bound copies of the paper were . The editor removed one of the bound volumes from the shelf , placed it on the desk , and opened it . " Here is a poem , " he said , " written by your father , Vahan Vagramian . It is called To My Haig , the word meaning both a boy 's name and our nation . May I read it ? Would you mind if I read it ? " They did not speak , and the man read the poem . It was fourteen lines , Rock saw , and as the man read , Rock remembered his father reciting the poem in the house on Winery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , " the man said . " Any father to any son , but it is also my friend speaking to his nation . It is also a great poem , never known to more than a handful of people , and now forgotten . These bound volumes containp102many more poems that your father wrote , as well as stories , essays , and editorials . You do not read , I know . Even so , sit here at this desk where your father worked , and I will return to my work . " He embraced each of them and went off to the machine , and to his work . They heard the machine clinking out the letters of the alphabet , dropping them into the words of the language . " Did you understand the poem ? " Haig said . " My father used to recite it at home , " Rock said . " I had forgotten it , but when he read it I remembered it . I understand it . I always did . " " What does it say ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a stranger , given to me by a stranger , my own father . I give it to you , my own son Haig , and a stranger . It is a poor world . Give this world to another stranger , your own son , for that is all any of us can do with this world . But it says these things in a way that must be called Armenian , for it says them in Armenian . " " Did n't it say some other things , too ? " Haig said . " Yes , it did , " Rock said . " It said , Would God this world were better and more , and you and I not stringers , for I love you , I love you so deeply that my love estranges you from me , me from myself , and love itself from love . " " Did n't you ever learn to read ? " Haig said . " I mean , would n't it be a good idea to read everything he wrote ? " " I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , " Rock said . " I was just beginning to learn when I quit . I did n't want to learn . It 's too late now . " " Do you want to say goodbye to the old man ? " Haig said . " He said goodbye , " Rock said . " He knows we 're not interested . He 's back there doing his lonely work , as he alwaysp103has . That work was supposed to be for us , but we 're not interested . We never were . Let 's go . " A man travels through a mournful dream seeking many things , but in the end they are all only one thing : the Word , and nothing in the lonely world is lonelier , for the name of the the word is Love . What is it a man needs ? Is it anything nameable ? If it is named , does the name mean the need ? Does it mean what it is supposed to mean ? If what a man needs is named Love , does Love mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does Meaning mean anything ? How long does Meaning mean whatever it means , and after that where is a man ? What 's a man supposed to do to be whatever he is supposed to be , to get whatever he is supposed to need ? A man is a wonderful and worthless thing . He is a rock but a swift one . Give him love , give rain love . Give him meaning , give fire meaning . Give him money , give birds money . THE cousins walked across the street to the motorcycle in front of the red-brick church , but instead of getting on the contraption the older one walked to the top of the cementp104steps and sat there , while the younger one , foot resting on the curb , waited . " How old was your sister Rose when she died ? " the older said . " She was three , " the younger said . " How old were you at the time ? " " Six . " " What did you think of her ? " Rock said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've forgotten . How old were you when your brother died ? " " Nine , and he was six , " Rock said . " What did you think of him ? " Haig said . " Before he died I thought he was the greatest man ever born , " Rock said . " Next to myself , I mean . But differently , in his own way . He was a smiler . I never smiled . After he died I did n't know what to think . Finally , I decided that he did it on purpose , let himself die , because he was a smiler . I decidedhe was a smiling killer . He killed me . He killed me a long time . He helped kill his father forever . I killed my father for a while myself , but not forever . I did n't smile and die and kill my father forever . I fought with my father and killed him for a while . When he was angry at me , I was angry at him . When he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . When he did n't want me to be whoever it was I was going to be , I fought with him . I had to . I had to find out who I was going to be . " " Who did you turn out to be ? " Haig said . " The one you see sitting here on the steps of the red-brick church . " " Which one 's he ? " " The father 's son , after all , " Rock said . " The Armenian , after all . The one he wanted me to be , after all . He broke myp105nose . I broke everything he did n't break . It took thirty-thrcc years . " " Could he fight ? " Haig said . " He was mad , " Rock said . " He could n't fight , but he was mad . " " If he could n't fight , how did he break your nose ? " " You do n't have to know how to fight to be able to break your son 's nose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mad enough to kill me , I suppose . " " How mad were you ? " " About the same . " " Did you fight back ? " " I started to , " Rock said , " but I changed my mind . " " Why ? " " I was afraid I would kill him , " Rock said . " If it 's not easy to be a son , do n't think it 's easy to be a father , either . He was right enough , but so was I. " " How did the fight start ? " Haig said . " He 'd seen me standing on a corner talking to a couple of street girls , " Rock said . " When I got home that night he told me that if he ever saw me doing that again he would give me a beating . He saw me the next night , and I saw him . The same girls . We were just standing there talking . He stood across the street , and then walked home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was sitting in the parlor , waiting . My mother had gone to bed . He got up and went to the backyard . I knew he expected me to follow him , so I did . I knew he expected me to fight , too , since I had already disobeyed him , and was as big as he was , so when he began to fight I began to fight , too . He did n't say anything , and I did n't . We foughtp106about a minute when I decided not to fight back any more . I did n't stop fighting , I just did n't fight back any more . My mother was standing on the steps of the back porch . She did n't say anything , either . He got me square on the nose and knocked me down . He walked to my mother and took her inside . My mother turned to me and said , Shame . ' She said it softly . One word , in Armenian . The most painful word in our language . I walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning when I got home . I went inside to ask him to forgive me . He was asleep on his folded arms at the round table in the parlor . He sat up and looked at me and shook his head slowly several times . You know the way they do it . " I said in Armenian , I ask you to forgive me . ' " He was dead tired and deeply angry . He stared at me a long time . " Go wash your face , ' he said at last . Eat something , go to your bed . ' " I said , Do you forgive me ? ' " For the fight , yes , ' he said . For the other , never . I will call Doctor Burridge in the afternoon to look at your nose . Is it broken ? ' " Yes . ' " I 'm sorry , ' he said . " After that , we were strangers . If we were n't a father and a son any more , we were n't enemies , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . " " Why did n't he want to see you standing on a corner ? " Haig said . " He wanted me to be a poet , " Rock said . " A man who reads , who writes , who lives in a proud , lonely world . " " What did you want to be , a pimp ? "  | " Do n't get funny , " Rock said . " I wanted to be anything I felt like being . I did n't feel like being alone . A man 's alone enough , anyway . I know I was , and I know I still am . I liked to read , I liked to write , and I still do , but I did n't want to read and write because he wanted me to . A man wants to do anything he does because he himself wants to do them . He wants to do them as himself , not as his father 's son , not as a member of a family , a nation , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , it turns out that even if he does what he does as himself , he also does them as the other things . " " So you 're a Christian , " Haig said . " I 'm an Armenian , " Rock said . " What 's your class ? " " The proud poor . " " What nation ? " " American . " " What race ? " " Human . " " What family ? " " Vagramian . " " Yes , you are , " the younger cousin said . " All you are is a human being , and you know what phonies they are . You do n't really want to go to Fat Aram 's , do you ? " " I want Fat Aram 's to be the way it was , " Rock said . " I do n't want it to be the way it is now . " " Well , it 's going to be the way it is now , anyhow , " Haig said . " Everything 's going to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be . You 're getting tired . " " I know , " Rock said . " That was the trouble with my father , too . Come on , we 'll go to Fat Aram 's and let it be any way it wants to be . "  | " And we 'll like it , too , " Haig said . They sat on the motorcycle and went roaring down Venturato Eye , up Eye to Tulare , and stopped in front of Fat Aram 's . What a man needs is unnameable , but he is forever naming it . Whisky  --  even the memory of whisky  --  helps him name it . A man 's mortality comes to him haphazardly in his mother 's womb . His mortality is a disease . It is himself on schedule , in the beat of time . Whether it is pain a man knows or pleasure , his health is poor , for his illness is in him instantaneously and forever , and it is incurable , although every man is indestructible , as he himself knows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men stood . They watched the arrival of the cousins on the motorcycle , one in uniform , one in a pair of blue gabardine slacks and a blue-and-white plaid coat . The four young men were laughing and talking in Armenian . The cousins pushed open the corner swinging doors and stepped into the saloon . It was five in the afternoon and the place was jammed with drinkers , most of them women . " What 's happened to the place ? " Rock said . " It 's doing well , that 's all , " Haig said . " It 's not the old place any more , that 's all . " " Where 's Fat Aram ? " " He does n't get around until after eleven , " Haig said . " He closes the joint , counts the money , sits alone with a few friends , drinks and talks . The place is jammed . The tables and booths are all taken . Want to go ? " " No , let 's get a drink , anyway , " Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right with you , " he said . He was busy , and at the other end of the bar so was the other boy . " I like this , " Rock said . " I wanted to see the place again . I 'm seeing it . It 's a money joint for sure now . What 's Fat Aram doing with all the money ? " " He 's investing it , " Haig said . " He looks like a business man these days . He belongs to the Rotarians , the Chamber of Commerce , the Lions , and just about everything else there is to belong to , and I understand he gets up at the lunches every now and then and gives a success talk . " " That 's great . " " The Indians clear out when it 's busy this way . You saw some of them in the street . " " What 's in the backroom now ? " Rock said . " Cards and the book when the town 's open , " Haig said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Indians have games all the time at one or another of the hotels , though . " The bartender got to them at last , and Rock ordered double Scotches over ice . The cousins touched glasses and Rock said , " Well , boy , I 'm in Fresno , I 've been to the house on Winery Street , I slept there last night , had breakfast there this morning , had a long talk with Lula , we 've seen most of the family that 's been near enough to come by , most of them are still in the house on Winery Street , we 'll go back after a couple of drinks and have dinner with them , we 've been to the redbrickchurch , we 've lighted candles , we 've prayed , we 've been to The Asbarez , we 've talked , and now we 're at Fat Aram 's . You 're in the Army , and I 'll soon be . Here 's to us , boy . Take care of yourself . "  | " Here 's to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks , and as luck would have it the bartender was near and was pouring Scotch , so they extended their glasses and he poured for them again . " I just wanted to see the place , " Rock said . " I 'm seeing it . It 's not the way it was , but it 's fine . It 's another world now all right . " " It 's the same world , " the boy said . " It 's just another time , that 's all . We said we 'd be back in a little while . We 've been gone at least an hour , have n't we ? " " It 's all right , " Rock said . " We 'll be back in time . Lula 's rousting them all around , and they 're having fun . I need these drinks badly , and here at Fat Aram 's . " " Listen , Rock , " the boy said suddenly . " Get out of it if you can . Do n't fool with it . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . It 's not for any of them who got drafted or any of them who enlisted because they knew they were going to get drafted , but it 's especially not for you . " " No , " Rock said . " I 've turned myself over to the machine . Whatever it 's got to do will be O.K. with me . I 'll do what I 'm told , go where I 'm told , when I 'm told . That 's more than I ever did for my father , my mother , or anybody else I know . " " Well , get married , anyhow , " Haig said . " I 'm thinking about it , " Rock said . " What 's she like ? " " Beautiful , but a liar . " " How do you know ? " Haig said . " I know when a girl 's beautiful , " Rock said . " How do you know she 's a liar ? " " I know when she 's a liar , too . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is that pos-sible ? " " It is . " " Marry her , " Haig said . " Suppose she is a liar ? " " I like liars , " Rock said , " but I do n't know how it would be to be married to one , to have kids by . " " It would be fine , " Haig said . " Marry her . " " I 'm thinking about it , " Rock said . Do n't think about it , " Haig said . " Just marry her . Where is she ? " " New York . " " Tell her to come out here , " Haig said . " Tell her to fly out . What else has she got ? " " She 's got seventeen years , " Rock said , " but they 're loaded . They 're loaded with something . Damned if I know what , though . " " Marry her , " Haig said . " Telephone her and tell her to fly out . What 's her name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Haig said . " You 're too Armenian to marry an Armenian . Mix it up . For the sake of your kids mix it up . It would n't do to marry an Armenian , or anybody like an Ar-menian . " " I 'm thinking about it , " Rock said . " Let 's go back to the house on A.Vinery Street . " A man 's mortality , his children 's mortality , comes to him haphazardly in his mother 's womb . It is a disease , and incurable . If a man and his friends are liars to one another , is their lying worth the trouble ? For is it not impossible to be a liar , after all ? Is not the lie also the truth ?  |p112THEY  were about to leave Fat Aram 's when Rock saw the four young men who had been standing outside the saloon on Tulare Street come back in . They came over to where the cousins were standing and drinking , and one of them said in English , " Are you Rock ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour ago asking for you . " " Have a drink , " Rock said . " We 're not drinking , " the speaker said . " We saw you come up on the motorcycle . We were n't sure it was you , but we decided to take a chance . " " Thanks , " Rock said . " What sort of a fellow was he ? " " Fat . " " Schwartz ? " Rock asked . " Did he mention his name ? " the speaker asked the other three . " Did he ? " they asked one another . " No , " the speaker said . " He just asked if we 'd seen you . He said it was important . " " Did he say where he was stopping ? " " No , " the speaker said . " If we see him again , shall we say we saw you ? " " You know the house on Winery Street ? " Rock said . " Yes . " " Tell him I 'll be there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are things going ? " " O.K. How about you ? " " We 're going in , too . Maybe we 'll run into you some-place . " " Sure , " Rock said . " Come on out to the house later on if you feel like it . "  | " No , " the other said . " We got a game coming up . " They went along , and Rock turned to his cousin . " How about another ? " he said . " Sure , " Haig said . " Who do you think it was ? " " It was Schwartz all right . " " Anything important ? " " No , " Rock said . " Do you know these fellows ? " " Not by name , " Haig said . " I 've seen them around . " " They look alike , do n't they ? " " They 're not even from the same city , " Haig said , " but they were all born in Fresno . " " I thought they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " Haig said , " one 's from Bitlis , one from Van , one from Moush , one from Harpoot . " " Which is our boy ? " " The one who spoke . He felt he had a right to , being from Bitlis . " " What do they do ? " " They work on the vineyards , in the wineries , in the packinghouses , or they drive trucks . " " Were n't they a little reserved ? " Rock said . " They do n't know you , " Haig said . " They wanted to talk , but the one from Bitlis would n't let them . They wanted to come out to the house , too . " The bartender handed them fresh drinks . Drinking , Rock wished he did n't have to leave town . He wished he was back to stay . Even with Fat Aram 's another kind of place altogether , he wanted to stay . He wanted to sit down in an allnightpoker game , get up from the game at six in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drive to the winery inp114Madera . He wanted to hang around the winery and smell the ferment of the grapes . He wanted to gamble all night and work all day and eat a bunch of muscats . He wanted to be back in Fresno , but it was too late . After the war , though , he 'd come back , he 'd buy a vineyard around Malaga , put up a house , have his wife and kids in it with him , and be home at last . " I 'm going to be drinking tonight , " Rock said . " You going to be going along with me ? " " I 'm supposed to go on duty at eight , " Haig said , " but I 'll get out of it . I 'll telephone a pal and give him ten bucks instead of five . " " Can you find the game ? " Rock said . " Sure , " Haig said . " I 'd like to get in it . How about you ? " " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army . " " I hope you 're lucky , then , " Rock said . " I like to gamble too much to be lucky , " Haig said . " I love to gamble so much I always lose . " " Do they play high ? " " Not too high . You 'll see a three-hundred-dollar pot every once in a while , though . " " Sounds like a good game , " Rock said . " I hope you win yourself enough to pay a pal all through the war . " " Pals pay me , too , " Haig said . " I run out of money , too . " They went out , got on the motorcycle , and slowly passed through the heart of the city , and then on to the house on Winery Street where the liars who were their family were telling lies to one another and little by little getting nearer and nearer to the truth , or something better , or something just as irrelevant.  |p115The  children of the family saw them coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street to the other . The children ran down the street to the motorcycle , and then ran after it . A man was on the lawn with a leather briefcase under his arm . It was not altogether unlikely that he was a member of the family , too . Almost before the motorcycle had stopped this man went to Rock and Haig , both of whom were a little drunk by now , and said , " I am Craig J. Adams . My mother is the second cousin of the Vagramians which did not come to America but went to Beirut , in Syria . I practice in New York . Harvard . I am here on government business . It was by accident I heard you were passing through . I 've spoken to your grandmother . Can I take you to dinner ? " " No , " Rock said . " Have dinner with us . Have you met everybody ? " " Is he a dentist ? " Haig said . " He looks like a dentist . " " Yes , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you speak Armenian ? " Rock said . " No , I 'm afraid I do n't . " " He talks like a dentist , " Haig said . Rock opened his mouth . " What 's happened to this tooth ? " he said in Armenian . The lawyer , who wore a thin neatly trimmed moustache , looked into Rock 's mouth . " What is it ? " he said in English . " Ca n't you understand , either ? " Rock said in English . " Very little , I 'm afraid , " Craig J. Adams said . " What 's the matter with this tooth ? " Rock said . " Is something the matter with one of your teeth ? " " The nerve 's been jumping in this one lately . "  | " I 'm sorry . " " It 's nothing , " Rock said . " Do you enjoy dentistry ? " " I am not a dentist , " Craig J. Adams said . " Oh ? " Rock said . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , I 'm a lawyer , " Craig J. Adams said . " Corporation and insurance , for the most part . A dentist would scarcely be out here on government business . " " Son of an Armenian , " Rock said in Armenian to the lawyer . " Do n't you understand ? Are n't you an Armenian , a little ? " And then in English he said , " Listen , Abbott , I 'm delighted to see you . " " Craig , " the man said . " Craig J. Adams . " " Yes , " Rock said . " You 've lived in the East all your life , have you ? " " Yes , " the lawyer said . " Our tics there with the older generation are not as close as yours are here . " " I want to ask a legal question , " Rock said . " These children will witness it , and my cousin Haig Vagramian . Haig , this is Craig J. Adams . " The cousin and the lawyer shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a dentist . " " This is the question , " Rock went on . He turned to the children . " Witness this , please , " he said in Armenian . " He ca n't speak Armenian ? " Haig said to Rock in Armenian . " What a phony . " " This is the question , " Rock said again . " I love a girl who is not Armenian . If I marry this girl and we have children , who is going to teach them to speak Armenian ? " " That is hardly a legal question , " the lawyer said . " Who is going to teach them , however ? " Rock said.  | " I do n't know , " the lawyer said . " Another question , then , " Rock said . " The girl says she wishes to learn Armenian , so she can speak to me , to my mother , to my grandmother . If she learns to do so , will she become an Armenian ? " " Yes , that 's right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this boy ? " Rock said to Haig . " That 's your first cousin , " Haig said . " Do n't you recognize him ? Avak Vagramian . " " Is that who you are ? " Rock said to the boy . " Yes , " the boy said . " Avak Vagramian . " " Krikor 's boy ? " " Yes , " the boy said . " He 's inside . We 've been here about an hour . We came from Kerman . My father brought you two bottles of rakhi . " " That 's my father 's younger brother , " Rock said to the lawyer . " He brought me two bottles . Will she become an Armenian ? " " Legally , " the lawyer said , " a wife accepts or acquires the various identifying cultural or religious labels of her husband , insofar as he himself is aware of them or has employed or acceptedthem . " " Witnesses , " Rock said . " You have heard for yourselves . " He turned to Haig . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of Krikor 's rakhi . Let 's go inside , cousin , " he said to the lawyer , " and drink to your health . " He turned to the children . " Any of you under twelve kindly drink strawberry pop . " He put his arm around the lawyer and said to him warmly , " Please overlook my being so glad to be home . I 'm delighted to see you . " They went inside , and Rock and his father 's youngerp118brother Krikor embraced . Then Rock went into the kitchen to speak to Lula . " Who 's cooked all this food ? " he said . " I put them all to cooking , " Lula said . " There is everything each of them knows best how to cook . I have done nothing but watch . There 's an open bottle there on the table . " Rock poured a tumblerful of the transparent liquid and handed it to his grandmother . He then poured three more and handed one to the lawyer , one to Haig , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Lula Vagramian , " he said . He lifted the bottle , as the others lifted their glasses , and everyone drank . The old lady coughed and said , " It 's good for my cough . " Rock found the water-level lady in the parlor and sat down beside her , drinking from the bottle . " Please tell me about the water level , " he said . " It 's falling , " the woman said . " There 's no telling when the whole place will become a desert again . " " Is there something we can do ? " Rock said . " I have been thinking that if we appointed a committee to write to Washington , it would perhaps help , " the woman said . Haig came to Rock and said , " Get on the telephone and talk to her . She 'll be here tomorrow . Meet her at the airport . Take her up to San Francisco with you in the car . By the time you get there Lula will have her talking Armenian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Right after dinner . " " Call her now , " Haig said . " I want to meet her . " " O.K. , " Rock said . He got up and started for the telephone in the hall , but on the way he ran into the lawyer and took him to the waterlevellady.  | " Here 's the man to talk to , " Rock said to the woman . " He has just come from Washington . He works for the government . He 's a lawyer . Speak English . He does n't speak Arme-nian . " He drank from the bottle again , and went to the telephone . He was suddenly scared to death she would n't be home , that he would n't be able to reach her , that she was out with Junk , or with somebody like him . The operator went to work on the call , saying she would call him back . He stayed beside the telephone , hanging onto the bottle . When the bell rang he was so excited he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the operator said . " Shall I try again in twenty minutes ? " " Where is she ? " Rock said . " Just a moment , please . " The operator went off the line a moment , came back , and said , " Her mother 's in , but she does n't know where she is . Will you speak to her mother ? " " Yes , " Rock said , " let me speak to her please . " And when the mother came on the line Rock said , " Where can I reach Ann ? " " She went out a few minutes ago , " the mother said . " I 'd like you and Ann to fly to Fresno tonight . " " Fresno ? " " Yes . It 's my home town . I 'm visiting my grandmother , on my way to San Francisco , to visit my mother . I 'd like you both to fly out and meet my family . " " I 'm afraid I ca n't , " the mother said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " She could n't , " the mother said . " She 's not eighteen yet . " " When will she be eighteen ? " Rock said . " Tomorrow night , " the mother said.  | " One day more or less does n't make much difference , " Rock said . " Are you going into the Army ? " the mother said . " Yes . In a few days . " " Is there anything I can send you ? " " Ann , " Rock said . " What ? " " You can send me Ann . " " Ann could n't come to California alone , " the mother said . " Send a friend with her , " Rock said . " I 'd like her to meet my family . " " Of course it 's Ann 's business where she goes , " the mother said , " but I do n't think she ought to go to California just now . " " Is she at the Stork ? " Rock said . " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find her , I 'll have her call you . " Rock gave the mother the number , and then said , " Is she all right ? " " She 's been unhappy because you said you would n't call her or see her again , " the mother said . " She 's been hanging around the house waiting for you to call . " " She thinks we ought to get married , " Rock said . " Do you think we ought to ? " " I do n't know , " the mother said . " She 's very young . " " That 's what I told her , " Rock said . " I 'm thirty-three . She said she would n't think of marrying a man who was n't thirtythree . She said she wants to learn Armenian . Do you think she could learn Armenian ? " " I do n't know , " the mother said . " It 's a rather difficult language , is n't it ? " " Not after you get the hang of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to be the wife of an Armenian ? "  | " I do n't know , " the mother said . " Is an Armenian very dif-ferent ? " " Very , " Rock said . " They order their women around and expect them to have a lot of children , keep house , cook , sew , sing , dance , and manage money . Do you think Ann ought to marry an Armenian ? " " I do n't know , " the mother said . " Are you drinking ? " " Yes , " Rock said . " I 'm home . I 'm in the house I was born in . It 's my grandmother 's house now . I 'd put her on to talk to you , but you do n't speak Armenian . " " No , " the mother said . " She speaks Kurdish and Turkish , too , " Rock said , " but all I 'd want Ann to speak would be Armenian . Do you think Ann ought to get into something like this ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd better not ? " " I know she 'd be furious if I said anything one way or another , " the mother said . " I know she 'd like to speak to you . Let me call a few places and have her call you . " " I wish you would , " Rock said , " but what do you think ? If she decided she wanted to get into something like this , would you be unhappy ? " " I want Ann to be happy , " the mother said . " In that case , " Rock said , " can you tell me what makes her happy ? " " Knowing someone loves her , " the mother said . " Do you love Ann ? " " Yes , " Rock said . " What else makes her happy ? " " She likes fine things , " the mother said . " She likes to shop . She likes to spend money . She likes to dress and go out and eat at the best restaurants and meet nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Ann likes . Of course you do . " " What else makes her happy ? " Rock said.  | " The things that make any girl happy , " the mother said . " Have you gotten a commission ? " " What 's that ? " Rock said . " A commission in the Army ? " the mother said . " You must get a direct commission from the President . You must be at least a Captain . " " Must I ? " Rock said . " Of course , " the mother said . " My husband can help you get a direct commission . He 's done it for others . You must n't waste yourself . " " I do n't want a commission , " Rock said . " You 've got a brilliant mind , " the mother said . " My husbandsays your I.Q. must be very high . He says you 're very intelligent . You must n't waste yourself . Let him get you a commission . " " I 'd have to be a General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct commission as a General , could he ? " " No , I do n't think they do that , " the mother said . " I wish you 'd fly out with Ann , " Rock said . " I 'd like you to meet my family . " " I ca n't , " the mother said . " I 'm going away for a month with my husband . He 's going on government business . We asked Ann to go with us , but she would n't . She 's been irritable . I think she 's in love . I 'll find her and have her call you . " " I 'll be waiting for Ann to call , " Rock said . " If she asks for your advice , tell her the right thing . " " She wo n't ask for my advice , " the mother said . " Is that so ? " Rock said . " She should . A girl should speak to her mother about everything that 's important to her . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's awfully independent . Always has been . And stubborn . "  | " And beautiful , " Rock said . " Have a nice holiday , and thank your husband for saying I have a high I.Q. Goodbye . " " Goodbye , " the mother said . He hung up and took another swig from the bottle . What does a man think ? What does he ever think ? All his life what does he think ? What is his thought ? What is his one thought which embraces all other thoughts ? Is it the thought which is any animal 's ? This ? This animal ? Myself ? Or does a man regret and hope all his life ?

How about another deal ? " He listened a moment . " I 'll give you ten , then , " he said . " Yes . Ten . I 'll leave it in an envelope with the CompanyClerk . No . It 's worth it . Thanks .

Would n't it be nice to be remembered a thousand years for having scratched on the wall of a cave ? Why does n't a man open his mouth and sing , making up a song so comforting as to impel beggars to transfer money from one pocket to another , or businessmen from one bank account to another ? Would n't that be lyrical ? Would n't it be practical and helpful ? Why does n't a man stop being nonsense and be something his mother can be proud of ? Does n't he love his mother ? Why does n't he say something his father can be happy about ? Does n't he love his father ? Why does a man fall in with strangers whose sincerity is dubious ?

" he said when he came back . " Not bad , " Rock said . " How do you feel ? "  | " I 'm sorry she did n't phone , " Haig said . " I said I feel O.K. , " Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have . " " She 'll phone . " " No , " Rock said . " How do you feel ? " " I never felt worse in my life , " Haig said . " Why ? " " Because human beings are such dirty crooks , " Haig said . " Who ? " Rock said . " Everybody , " Haig said . " Especially the bright ones , not the ones I see coming into the Army every day . They break your heart . I feel lousy because just staying alive calls for so much cleverness that it bores me to death . Just to stay alive you 've got to be a crook . " " Maybe you do at that , " Rock said , " but do n't let it bother you too much . " " O.K. , " Haig said . " If she does n't phone , are you going to phone her ? " " I do n't know , " Rock said . " I 'm thinking about it . " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm thinking about that too . " " What do you mean ? " Haig said . " I mean Myra Clewes was probably right about her . " " Who 's Myra Clewes ? " " She produces plays , " Rock said . " I took her out a couple of times in New York . She told me to forget her . I 'd planned to , but she phoned and I did n't want to make too much of a point of forgetting her . I thought not making a point of it would be the best way to get over it , but after a month I had it worse than ever . It was time to get back to San Francisco.  |p134I  wanted to drive across the country once more . I wanted to be alone . I told her it was over . I said I would n't call her . That was eight or nine days ago , or six or seven . I 've forgotten . " " What 's the matter with her ? " Haig said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to marry a girl who 's been around , " Rock said . " I told her so . She swears she 's had nothing to do with anybody except me . " " Maybe she 's telling the truth , " Haig said . " No , " Rock said . " She 's lying . She lies all the time . If she told the truth , clean , I think I 'd marry her anyway . I 've been all over the place , so if she has too , maybe we could make a good marriage . I do n't think she can tell the truth . I mean I think it 's unnatural for her to tell the truth . I think it 's deeply painful . I think she hates the truth . I ca n't imagine why , though . " " Are you sure you 've got her right ? " Haig said . " You do n't spend two months with a girl and get her wrong , do you ? " Rock said . " The trouble is I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more that she is a liar . At the same time , I 'm angry at her because her mother has n't been able to reach her . I 'm burning because maybe she is in bed with somebody . I do n't want anybody to get near her any more . I want her to tell me the truth about herself , forget it , and be my wife . " " You want a girl to be your wife who 's been with other men ? " Haig said . " This girl , " Rock said . " I told you I 've got it bad . " " What 's she got ? " " I do n't know . " " Is she that good ? " " No , " Rock said . " She does n't know enough to be good . Shep135fools around at being real , for me . That 's because she 's a baby . I told her long ago I liked her the way I felt she really was . " " What way is that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , " Rock said . " It 's all there . It just needs somebody  --  me , of course  --  to notice and cherish it . There would n't be much to notice and cherish , though , if she had to go on being a liar , or if she preferred being a liar , or if she just did n't want me to have anything special to notice and cherish . She says she 's not lying . She says she wants to be what I think she really is . She says she loves me and wants to marry me and have children , and does n't want anything else  --  ever . And here I am in Fresno , wanting to believe her . " " Maybe you 'd better find a girl who ca n't lie , " Haig said , " instead of a girl who ca n't tell the truth . " " I 'm thinking about that too , " Rock said . " Between the two of them , the one I 'm involved with , and the one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Schwartz came back into the room . " He 'll be here sometime tonight , " Schwartz said . " He was n't sure he could get to the airport in time to get the next plane , but he 'll be here sometime tonight , Rock . " Rock got up . " We 'll be in the game at the hotel , " he said . " All right , " Schwartz said . " Can I come up there until it'stime to go out to the airport to meet P.K. ? " " Do you want to play ? " Rock said . " If it 's all right , " Schwartz said . " It 's all right , " Rock said . He went into the parlor , to his grandmother , and said , " I may not get in until morning . We 'll drive to San Franciscop136soon after I get in . When they go home , go to sleep . I wo n't say goodbye . " " Who is the English-speaking lawyer ? " Lula said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Never saw him before in my life . " " He 's no member of the family , " Lula said . " He 's an Armenian , anyway . " " He 's no Armenian . He neither speaks nor understands the language . " " Well , he 's a lawyer , then . " " Beware of lawyers , " Lula said . " Keep away from them . " " It was a wonderful dinner , " Rock said . " I 'll see you when I get home . " He went out and found his cousin and Schwartz standing beside his car , waiting . They got in and he drove off , thinking , " A man is no joke . No man is a joke . Having life is no joke , but would n't it be nice if he went to the capitals of the world and said , One body , one soul , union , fraternity , love , ' and all the other nice things ? " Every man is afraid of something , but most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are few moments in the life of any man in which there is no disgrace , and none in which there is no death . The nobler the man is the more aware he is of the disgrace in himself , the nagging absence of grace . The more alive the man is the more aware he is of the death in himself . Everything he is afraid of is himself , as he himself knows , going about his business , which is a business of deathly struggle all his life . But every man is fearless , too . He is afraid of nothing . Having fearlessly emerged from the womb , he is forever after fearless . Having fearlessly accepted his head , hep137can never again be afraid of anything . Having fearlessly gottenonto his feet and walked , he can go anywhere fearlessly . Having fearlessly looked into the eyes and face of his mother and father , he can forever after look into the eyes and face of any man or animal . A man is a bold fellow . He is a game fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwartz was afraid of was his uncle Paul Key . He was afraid of everybody else , too , but as he did n't have time to notice , he did n't know or care that he was . He noticed that he was afraid of Paul Key all the time . As a child his mother had spoken of no one but Paul Key , her younger brother . He was the man Sam should try to be like . This was unfair , because Sam was big and soft and heavyladen , whereas Paul , twenty-five years his senior , was small , hard , and all nervous gristle . Still Schwartz wanted to be like Paul Key . At last , working without a contract , they reached an agreement . It happened when Schwartz was twenty-two . The agreement was as follows : Samuel Schwartz would attend Paul Kecsler . Sam would be available at all times to do anything Paul asked him to do . The young man was thrilled . He said nothing about money or hours , and nothing was ever made specific in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work to take two hundred dollars and go out and have himself a new suit of clothes made to fit his new body  --  larger than it had been a year ago . It was also part of Sam 's work to get on an airplane and fly to New York , go to a certain address , speak to somebody there , and telephone Paul Key . Once it was a girl who worked in a retail baker 's . Somebody had told Paul Key that the girl was Joan of Arc herself.  |p138Sam  telephoned Paul and said , " She 's crazy , P.K. She said I 'm Death . She said it in Yiddish . " " Yiddish ? " Paul said . " Is n't her name Marie Gallimard ? " " I do n't care what her name is , " Schwartz said . " She 's crazy . What do you want me to do now ? " " Did she say anything else in Yiddish ? " " Everything she said was in Yiddish . " " Does she look like Joan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ? " Schwartz said . " Well , does she look strong and fearless and like an angel ? " Paul said . " No , " Schwartz said . " She looks like a girl who works in a bakery . I 'm next door to the bakery now . What do you want me to do ? " " Buy a dozen bagels and take the next plane back . " " They do n't sell bagels . " " Buy a dozen sugar doughnuts and take the next plane back . " Another time it was a cellar room in the tenements , in which Sam was supposed to find a new writer . Sam found a man who lived with eight alley cats . He was sixty-five years old and had been writing all his life . " What do you write ? " Sam said . " Books ? " " No , " the man said . " Just inspirational things I get out of the air . " " Like what , for instance ? " Sam said . " Well , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the man said . " I come right home and wrote it down . Here it is on this paper bag . Be good to your mother . Your mother was good to you . ' How true that is . These things come to me out of the air as I walk . "  |p139Sam  listened to eight or nine of the things that had come to the old man out of the air , and then he telephoned Paul Key . Paul had his secretary take down everything Sam remembered . A year later one of Paul Key 's biggest successes was called Be Good , Baby , and Sam believed his work had been well done . He often told his mother about the old man with the cats . " He was a saint , " Sam said . " A saint . It was no good haulinghim to Hollywood . It would have spoiled him . We changed his idea around a little . " Sam was in fact good to his mother , and she was n't in fact good to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key was the man : swift , brilliant , intelligent , dynamic . Now , sitting alone in the back seat of the new car , Schwartz said , " What 's that nice new smell in this car , Rock ? " " That 's the leather of the seats , Sam . " " Makes you feel good to smell something new like that , " Schwartz said . " It goes away after about a year , " Rock said . " Why does it do that , Rock ? " " Time , " Rock said , thinking of other things . " The same thing happens to everything else . At first it 's new and has a new smell . Time goes by and it 's no longer new and has n't got a new smell . How much money you got on you , Sam ? " " Three or four hundred , " Schwartz said . " You need some money , Rock ? You can have all I 've got . " " No , but I may want to borrow some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How much money have you put away ? " Rock said . " I do n't know , " Schwartz said . " P.K. gives the money to my mother , to keep for me. "  | " He does ? " " My mother keeps it for me , " Schwartz said . " My mother and I , we 've got a fine house , nice furniture , good clothes , money in the bank . P.K. 's like a father to me . He gets mad at me sometimes , but he 's like a father . You wo n't tell him I told you about the story , will you ? " " No , " Rock said . " He may not decide to mention it him-self . " There were five in the game in room 6o6 . The room was quiet . The game was quiet . The men were at work , and it was serious work . Schwartz moved around on tiptoe . Places were made , and the three new players sat down to play . After an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game stopped a moment while everybody got a fresh drink . Everybody met and talked . Two hours later Paul Key came into the room with his nephew Sam Schwartz . He saw that Rock Wagram was drunk and busy , so he sat down to wait . Half an hour later Rock counted his chips and pushed them across the table to Haig . " I 've got to go for a while , " he said . " Play these while I 'm gone . " " I may lose them , " Haig said . " Lose them . " " Cash in a hundred , anyway , " Haig said . " No , " Rock said . " Cash in when everybody else cashes in . " " You want to get back in the game , Schwartz ? " one of the players said . Sam looked at his uncle , who did n't look very pleased about what he 'd heard.  | " You lost about a hundred , " the player went on . " You 've got a place in the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uncle again . " Go ahead , " Paul Key said . " Sit down and play . " Sam was sure P.K. was being sarcastic . He was sure this wasnothing better than a trick . He waited patiently for the knife . Would it be the biggest knife yet ? Would he be knifed to death this time ? His uncle got up , smiled , and took him by the arm . There was laughter in his voice , and it was n't mean laughter . " Go ahead , Sam , " Paul said . " Sit down with the boys and play . Play until the game stops . If you run out of money -- Well , here . Here 's a blank check with my signature on it . Fill it out and remember how much it was , so I can keep my records straight . " The nephew sat down . He was stunned . He looked up at his uncle . He did n't have far to look . There were tears in his eyes , and he wished to God he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the world . Was P.K. planning to do a picture about a poker game ? Was this just another assignment that Sam did n't understand ? Or did his uncle actually want him to do something Sam himselfwanted to do ? Sit down in a quiet poker game and play all night and not have to be scared to death every minute that his uncle would hear about it ? And knife him half to death about it ? His uncle seemed truly earnest and truly kind . Was it possible that , even so , he was being sarcastic , more deeply so than ever ? Was he going to knife him later on ? Or was it the real thing at last ? Did his uncle really feel at last that it was all right for Sam not to be exactly the same kind of man that he was ? That it was all right for Sam to be Sam ? For Sam notp142to be swift and clever and far-thinking ? For Sam to be fat , to sit comfortably in a chair in a quiet poker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw what was going on between the nephew and the uncle . He poured three straight shots , handed one to Sam , another to Paul , and lifted his own . " Here 's to my pal , Sam Schwartz , " Rock said . " To my pal , too , " Paul Key said . " Good luck , " several of the players said quietly . They drank , Sam gulping his down eagerly , and smiling . Rock and Paul Key went out and walked down the long hall to the elevator . " He worships you , " Rock said . " I 'm glad you 'd rather he did n't , though , at last . " " Where can we go to talk ? " Paul said . " What 's Fat Aram 's like these days ? " " We can go there , " Rock said . In the street Rock said , " I 'm getting scared to death I 'm seeing a lot of people I like to see for the last time . " " Nothing 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting to feel something 's going to happen to them , " Rock said . " I do n't mean they 're going to die . I hope Vida and the kids are well . I hope you 're O.K. Everything 's got to die , but that does n't mean I 've got to like it when it happens inside people I like . " " I want to have a long talk with you , Rock , " Paul said . " It 's very important . They walked in silence to Fat Aram 's , everything everywherescaring both of the fearless men half to death . Every man needs his family , but is his family his mother and father and their mothers and fathers ? Or is his family hisp143sons and daughters and their sons and daughters ? Or is his family anybody 's mother and father and son and daughter ? Is a man 's father his father , or anybody 's father , or is his father anybody 's son ? " YOU 'RE like a son to me , " Paul Key said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father , " Rock said . " Take it easy . " " I know you 've been drinking , " Paul Key said . " I mean , for a couple of months , but do n't you think I have , too ? " " Do n't want me to be like a son to you , " Rock said . " I had a talk with Myra Clewes night before last , " Paulsaid . " Did you read Patrick Kerry 's play ? " " I read it , " Rock said . " I 'm sure you think it 's a good play . " " Have you ? " Rock said . " Have I what , Rock ? " " Have you been drinking a lot for a couple of months ? " " Yes , I have , " Paul said . " I thought so , " Rock said , " because you think you 're my father , and you 're sure I think the play 's a good play , and so on and so forth . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk , at any rate , " Paul said . " I did n't mean to be mean , " Rock said . " I ate too much for supper . I met most of my family again for the first time in years . The supper 's made me sleepy , the family 's made me ashamed . It 's made me want to get married and have a family of my own , the last resort of the failure . Being sleepy and ashamed , I probably seem mean , but I do n't mean to be mean . Tell me your story and I 'll tell you mine . " " What story , Rock ? "  | " You did n't fly here to tell me you think you 're my father , " Rock said . " You did n't fly here to tell Schwartz he could sit down with the new Armenian hoodlums of the town and play poker , either . That was nice of you , but you did n't fly here to be nice to your sister 's fat son . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son as I ever heard about . A finer son than I 've ever been . A real son , a true son . So what 's your story , Paul ? " " I 'm glad we 're here in your home town , in the saloon I found you in , Rock , " Paul Key said . " This is my story . I can tell it to you . Here at Fat Aram 's . I could n't tell it to anybody else anywhere else . I wrote the play Myra Clewes asked you to read , The Indestructibles . I 've been writing since I was a kid . Everything I ever wrote seemed to be sicker than anything in this world has a right to be . Except this play . Over there at that bar seven or eight years ago I stood waiting for you to stop talking to your pals and give me a drink . I wrote the play the way you talked that day . I wrote it swiftly and easily , as if it was n't myself writing it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute I was writing it . I sent it to New York and had it typed . When it came back I read it , and could n't believe I had written it . I looked at other things I had written to see if they were at all like it . They were n't . They were sick , and the play was n't . What are you smiling about , Rock ? " " Am I smiling ? " Rock said . " Yes , " Paul said . " What 's it about ? Is something the matter with the play ? " " Go ahead with the story , " Rock said . " What 's the matter with the play ? " Paul said . " There is n't any more to the story if something 's the matter with the play . Is something the matter with it ? " " No . Go ahead . "  | " Is it a good play ? " " Yes . Go ahead . " " Would you have liked to have written it ? " Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder , " Rock said , " but yes , I would . " " Do you see yourself in it ? " " I see myself in everything I read . " " Rock , " Paul said , " only Myra Clewes knows I wrote that play . Myra Clewes , and yourself . Vida does n't know . A man can do things like that . I had expected to hear from Myra that you were crazy about the play . When she said you had read it but did n't want to appear in it , I did n't know what to think . I thought you thought it was no good , and if you did , that was too bad for me . " " Why ? " Rock said . " Why ? " Paul said . " A man 's only got so long . I have n't got forever . That play is my life . Why should n't you know I 'm dying ? I 'm dying , Rock . I 'm scared to death . I 'm sixty , Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had three heart attacksin seven years , but that is n't why I 'm dying , either . I 'm dying because until I wrote this play I knew in my heart that I was a lie . A whole lie . A man can be a lie only so long . If the play is what I think it is , I know I 've stopped being a lie . I know I 've stopped dying , and so it wo n't matter any more that I am actually dying . It wo n't scare me any more . You saw what happened between my nephew and myself a few minutes ago . That was because I 'd written that play . That was because I believed I had stopped dying and could therefore stop killing . " " It 's a remarkable play , there 's no doubt about that , " Rock said.  | " Nobody 's ever written anything like it , have they ? " Paul said . " The English never did , the Russians never did , the Germans , the Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of their best playwrights ever wrote one like that one , did they , Rock ? " " No , " Rock said . " It 's a new thing , the first of its kind , maybe the last . " " Is it great ? " Paul said . " In a new way , it is , " Rock said . " In a truer way , it is . " " Then , how does it happen you did n't get excited about it ? " Paul said . " I do n't get excited , " Rock said . " Did n't you tell Myra anything ? " " I told her I thought it would be a good play to see on the boards . I told her I thought it would fail . " " Why ? Why do you think it 'll fail ? " " It 's new , " Rock said . " It 's true , and most people in the theatre are neither , and do n't know how to become either . They 'll only make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did you tell her these things ? " Paul said . " No . " " Why did n't you , Rock ? " " I did n't think I needed to , " Rock said . " I did n't know you had written it . I thought Patrick Kerry had . I did n't know you were out here dying of anxiety . I just thought it was a play that seemed great that I could n't do anything about . " " Are n't you astonished that I wrote it ? " " It never occurred to me that you could find time to write . " " Do you remember when I was asking you questions thatp147first time at Romanoff 's and you said you liked to read and write ? " Paul said . " It never occurred to me , either , that you could find time to do anything except hang around , the way I had seen you hanging around this saloon , standing behind that bar , telling stories to the boys . I was astonished . Now that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the kind of play it is ? " " I 'm not astonished , " Rock said . " I 'm glad , because it 's the kind of play that should have gotten itself written at last . I 'm glad you wrote it , because I happen to know you . Any more to the story ? " " That 's it , " Paul said , " except for the details . I 've told you my story . You tell me yours . " " I 'd like the war to be over , " Rock said , " so I wo n't have to go into the Army . " " Anything else ? " Paul said . " No . " " Can we talk about this ? " " I 'm comfortable , " Rock said . " The girl is bringing us drinks whenever we want them . Schwartz and my cousin are in the poker game . I 'll be going back to get in after a while . We can talk . " " The war is n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know , " Rock said . " Being a Private in any Army is no fun for any man . " " I know , " Rock said . " One day is a long time for the kind of man I am , and the kind you are , " Paul said . " Yes , it is . " " A year is a very long time . "  | " Two or three years are long enough to change a man , or finish him . " " Most likely . " " What do you want to do , Rock ? " " I want the war to be over . " " It wo n't be over for two or three or four or five years , Rock . " " I suppose not . " " What do you want to do ? " " I want it to be over . " " A lot of people who think they 're in good physical shape actually are n't , " Paul said . " I do n't know why you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've had my physical and I 'm O.K. , " Rock said . " I saw the others who had their physicals at the same time and were classified O.K. , and I know I 'm certainly as O.K. as they are . If a first-rate physician gave me a complete check-up and discovered that I was n't O.K. , I know he would also be able to discover that every man in the Army is n't O.K. , if they or he or friends of theirs or his wanted him to go to the trouble . I 've heard what the boys are doing . I do n't blame them . Besides , they are going to help sell War Bonds , and entertain , and things like that . I would n't do any of those things .

Do n't be unhappy . It 's a good play , and you 're not dying any more .

I want to get back to the poker game now. , , " I 'd like to get in the game , too , " Paul said . They got up and began to walk back to the hotel , neither father nor son , nor brother , nor friend , but accidents which had happened to . meet by accident , and by accident had continued to meet , to tell one another the unfolding of the accidentalstory , something winking in each of them , knowing the story was enormously meaningless , unfortunate , depressing , and something to be instantly forgotten .

I thought you 'd do the play , first in New York , then in films , for the whole world to see . Something 's the matter that I do n't like that 's so nearly not the matter that I believe it could be quickly stopped if somethingcould be quickly done that had nothing the matter with it . " You 're drunk , " Rock said . " A big man in a small body drunk , stumbling around trying to stop dying . The dying 's not to be stopped . It 's not to be stopped by not liking what 's happening to anything . I had my shoes shined in this Shoe Shine Parlor . I sat in that second chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

I see him standing there still . He was n't much older than I am now . But he was mistaken about himself , about his son , and about the girls . We were talking about betterthings than I have ever found people anywhere to talk to about . " " What things , Rock ? " " We were talking about the accidents that had happened to each of us , " Rock said , " each accident small and unimportant , sometimes amusing and pleasant , and how out of these ac/cidents each of us had come to that corner , that evening , in this town . We were talking about the fun we 'd had having our accidents and about the fun we were going to have having more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.P. Depot , to go to San Francisco , and we had stood on the corner and talked a couple of times before and laughed and knew we 'd never do that again , never have another chance to stand there and talk to one another about nothing in particular again , and I never saw them again . He was wrong about them . He was wrong . He was wrong about himself and myself . My father 's all over this town . He could n't stand it , but he could n't go anywhere else , either , for he had to be where his family was , his people , where he could write what he had to write and know his people would read it . He wrote and they read . The play will be performed , and you will see it . One of your sons will stop someplace in Beverly Hills some night , outside Romanoff 's maybe , or outside the William Morris Agency , and remember that you and he had been there once together , that you 'd worked hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were mistaken about yourself and about him , and that you wrote all the time but did n't like what you wrote and did n't let your wife , his own mother , know that you wrote , and then after a whole lifetime of being mistaken about everything , you wrote a play in which you were n't mistaken at last , and it was performed and nothing happened , and there he is , your son , a man of thirty or thirty-five himself now , himself mistaken about himself and about his wife and his son and his daughter , and there 's Romanoff 's , or there 's the William Morris Agency , and that 's all it came to . Why could n't you have been a tailor ? " " A tailor , Rock ? " Paul said . " Why should I be a tailor ? My father was a tailor . "  | " Did n't he want you to be a tailor , too ? " " Yes , but he was mistaken , too , " Paul said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailor . " " What should he have been ? " Rock said . " He should have been a clown , " Paul said . " He was even smaller and uglier than I am , but I never saw him when he was n't laughing in his eyes or moving his arms and legs in a way to amuse God . It was an accident that he was a tailor , just as it was an accident that you stood on the corner and talked to the girls about accidents , but it was no accident that I got into the world of ideas . I did that , Rock . I decided to do it , Rock , and I did it . " " You shit , " Rock said . " You decided to do it , and you did it ! That was an accident , too . It was an accident you wrote the play , too . It was an accident you met Vida , an accident she saw you were n't ugly , an accident you saw that she saw , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have had a vineyard and three or four kids . Accidentally the vineyard and accidentally the kids , and accidentallyI 'd be the same man I am , bored the same as I am , and unwilling to trade places with anybody in the world , the same as I am . I 'll tell what Jews and Armenians have in com-mon . " " What , Rock ? " " Fathers , " Rock said . " They have mothers in common , too , but the way they have fathers in common is the way that comes to something accidentally . Of course he was a clown , and there was never a series of accidents by which you could ever forget it , and none by which your son shall ever forget what you were accidentally . "  | " I was a man who worked hard , and loved his wife and kids , " Paul said . " That 's not what he 'll remember , " Rock said . " He 'll remember that you were small and ugly and knew it , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mad . I suppose his father was , too . My mother 's father was , at any rate . We have fathers in common . We 're fathers ourselves the minute we 're born . We get over being sons quicker than any other people in the world . Our sons do , too . We fix our fathers , and our sons fix us . That 's the reason we 're intelligent . That 's the reason we know so much more about everything than other people do without needing to go to the trouble of studying anything . We have fathers in common , and we 're fathers at birth because we want enough of us to be around to receive the accidents , just in case an assortment or series of them is going to happen to somebody some day that is going to make a difference . You 'll see the play , but your son , or both of them , wo n't know , even if they see it , any more about what it is  --  a new thing , a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even turn out to be a joke they will be able to laugh at . Shall we go up and get in the game ? " " I thought you 'd do the play , Rock , " Paul said . " I thought you 'd do anything to do it . " " I would n't do anything to do it , " Rock said . " Accidents happen to me . I do n't do anything to stop them from happening . I never have . I never have , because I 'm curious to know what the accidents are going to be , and what they are going to do and how they are going to do it , and because I 'm not sure the accidents are n't at last going to come to what I want and have always wanted anyway . " " What 's that ? "  | " To be , to have been , a good witness , " Rock said . " Did your father kill himself , or did somebody else kill him ? " " He killed himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threading needles and sewing buttonholes . How did your father die ? " " He died of old age , " Rock said . " Let 's go on in and get in the game . " " How about one drink in the hotel bar ? " Paul said . " Make it two , " Rock said . " The game 's there . It 'll keep . " They went into the hotel bar and had two , then three , thenfour . Rock asked the bartender to hand him the telephone . He called Ann Ford and talked to her mother again . " It 's four o'clock in New York , " Ann 's mother said . " Is there any madness in the family ? " Rock said . " Any what ? " " Any madness . I have n't met Ann 's father . Was he mad ? " " Mad ? " " Yes . " " There is no insanity in my family , or in Ann 's father 's family . They are all property owners . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said madness . " " They are all practical , " the mother said . " Scotch-Irish on her father 's side . Russian-French on her mother 's . All wellto-doand well-mannered . " " She did n't telephone me , " Rock said . " I was n't able to reach her , " the mother said . " Where is she ? " Rock said . " In bed , I suppose , " the mother said . " In bed with who ? " Rock said . " Alone , of course , " the mother said . " My daughter enjoys going out and having fun , but all her people behave like ladies and gentlemen . Alone , of course . "  | " You mean she 's in her own bed in her own room ? " Rock said . " Yes , of course , " the mother said . " It 's four o'clock . " " I 'd like to talk to her , " Rock said . " I did n't think you wanted to talk to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her bed . I guess she 's unplugged it . I 'll go wake her up and have her plug it in . Hold on . You must be drunk to call at four in the morning and ask if we 're mad . " " I 've got a high I.Q. , though , " Rock said . " I 'll go wake her up , " the mother said . " That 's her mother , " Rock said to Paul Key . " She 's gone to wake her up . " " Where 's her father ? " Paul said . " I do n't know , " Rock said . " They 're divorced . Her mother'smarried again . The first husband was her own age . This one 's older . I have n't met her father . I hear he 's a gentleman drunk . A Scotch-Irish gentleman drunk . The daughter of that ought to go all right with the son of an Armenian manic depressive poet . The son and daughter of fathers like that ought to have pretty good sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl ? " Paul said . " I want to find out if I do , " Rock said . " I expect to find out now . " " Now ? " " More or less . " " What do you know about her ? " " Wait a minute , " Rock said . " I think she 's plugged the phone in . " " You dirty dog you ! " Ann said . " You said you were n't going to phone , then you phone at four in the morning ! Whatp157do you want , you dirty stinking dog ? My mother 's standing over my bed . Go away , Mother ! She says I ought to be ashamed to talk the way I 'm talking . Oh , go away , Mother , and do n't you dare listen on the other phone ! You hang up the minute you get back to your bed ! And do n't you dare life the receiver later on , either ! She 's gone now . Listen , you dirty dog ! You 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being made sick as a dog . What do you want ? " " I 'm driving to San Francisco in a few hours , " Rock said . " Take down this number and this address . " He gave her the telephone number and the address , then said , " Fly to San Francisco . Phone me before you leave . I 'll pick you up at the airport and take you to the St. Francis Hotel . " " Do you want to marry me ? " Ann said . " I want you to meet my mother , and her mother . " " I want to meet your grandmother 's mother , " Ann said . " Where 's she , you dirty dog ? You want me to meet your mother and her mother ! Do n't you love me ? Do n't you want to marry me ? I ca n't wait to meet them . I hope they 'll like me . Do you think they will ? " " Yes , I do . " " If they like me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hear you 're eighteen now , " Rock said . " I hear it 's your birthday . " " Yes . What are you going to give me ? " " Eighteen . " " Eighteen what ? Oh , you dirty dog ! I love you , Rock . Do you love me ? " " Yes . " " I 'll phone you , " Ann said . " Do n't you dare make a passp158at any of those California girls , do you hear ? Wait for me . " " I 'll wait , " Rock said . " Happy birthday . " He hung up and turned to his friend . " I 'm going to marry her , " he said . " Why ? " Paul said . " Who is she ? You do n't know her . Myra Clewes said something about her . Myra knows her . You do n't know her . Myra does n't think she 's the girl for you at all . Why are you going to marry her ? " " For my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father the minute I was born . No sense being a father without kids . I want to see them now . I 'd like to see them looking at least half like her . Let 's go get into the game . Schwartz and my cousin are probably broke by now . Let 's go sit down and look at the cards . " Is a man his father and his son fighting in him for a chance to share in the common indestructibility ? Every man 's life means more than any other man may ever guess or suspect , more than any man himself may ever guess or suspect , as he himself knows . The mystery of every man is a full-grown thing while he is still in his mother 's womb . To live , to go on living , is to have this full-grown thing worn away by time until nothing is left . As the wearing away proceedsthe meaning of a man 's life grows farther and farther past knowing or guessing , until meaning and no-meaning are one and the same . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poker game at two in the morning ? What does he mean , carrying this full-grown but vanishing thing to the cards and their values ? Does he mean it is he who is lucky ? Does his sitting there mean he is drawing nearer with each hand dealt to fatherhoodp159and proud unimportance , to love and fun , to health and gladness ? Does it mean that if he makes a heart-flush the war will end by morning ? Does it mean that if he draws to two pair and makes a full house his children will be handsome and have fine hearts and minds ? Does it mean that if he is dealt a pat queen high straight the girl he marries will be the one woman in the world to send him by accident to the best end he could ever reach ? THE boy whose parents were from Bitlis , who spoke to Rock at Fat Aram 's , who took Schwartz in a taxi to the house on Winery Street , was Bakrat Bonapartian , called Buck Bonapart . He was one of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years all but made extinct by the machine . He took his bench , nail rack , and hatchet from one small grape shipper to another , nailing three or four days for one , five or six for another . The owners of the box-making machines asked a dollar sixty-five for a hundred lugs , Buck Bonapart asked a dollar fifty . Thus by underselling the machinehe practiced his proud trade , nailing at top speed a hundred lugs in two hours . In twelve hours he earned nine dollars . Sometimes , however , he worked on and earned twelve dollars . Still , he gambled as if he had gotten his money from his father . Rock Wagram was glad to see that after losing two hundred dollars on an eight full to a ten full , Buck Bonapart was able to win four hundred from Paul Key on a pair of sixes against a bluff . " How did you know I was bluffing ? " Paul Key said . " I did n't , " Buck said . " I just had a hunch you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck 's friends said , a man of twenty/one called Pitcher because he had pitched for Fresno High the only year they beat Bakersfield and won the Valley Championship . " The heart of a lion , the brain of a boob . " " Boob , " Buck said quietly . " Brain of a boob . I suppose I played that wrong ? " " Call a three-hundred-dollar bet with a pair of sixes , and right or wrong you 'll soon be sleeping in the streets , " Pitcher said . " You 're talking about pitching , " Buck said . " This is poker . I got the same idea Paul did . I was going to bet three hundred to try to get the hundred in the pot . When he beat me to it , I asked myself if he was bluffing and the answer I got was yes . " " Where 'd you get it , Buck ? " Paul Key said . " Where 'd you get the answer ? " " I do n't know , " Buck said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You drew two to something , a flush most likely . I drew three to a pair of sixes . You got nothing and I got nothing . But I got the answerwhen I asked the question . Is n't that what poker is ? Is n't it asking them and answering them ? I never try to trick another player into telling me what he 's got . I never look at him , I never ask him anything , I never tell him anything . I play poker with God . " He laughed softly . " I guess that 's where I get the answers , and the questions , too . " " You 're entitled to that money , " Paul Key said . He shuffled and dealt . " This time it 'll be a different story . " " My grandmother , " Buck said , " always used to say , God is big . ' A different story , a different God . There 's enough to go around , I guess . Anybody here can take my money if he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The cards were dealt , the talk stopped . It had been so quiet in the first place as to have been not much more than thep161game 's continuous quietude . No one had paid much attention to the actual words said , or the actual meaning of them , except Paul Key . Rock was thinking of Ann Ford , of having her meet his grandmother and his mother . Next to Rock , on his left , Buck Bonapart was thinking of the vineyard he would buy after the war . Next to Buck , Schwartz was thinking the world must be coming to an end for his uncle to be sitting in a poker game with an assortment of Armenians , a most happy end , for there was his uncle losing and winning , but mainly losing , and happier ( or something ) than he had ever before seen him . Next to Schwartz , Haig Vagramian was thinking that if he could get through this game without losing he was a cinch to get through the war without getting killed , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wildly , with astonishment at his mistakes , with gladness at his successes . Next to Haig , Pitcher was thinking that if he was lucky he might still have a pretty good arm after the war and might be signed by one of the teams in the Coast League , the San Francisco Seals , he hoped . Next to Pitcher , a man of twenty-seven with black bushy eyebrows called Aslan was thinking it must be a small world , after all , for a man who was supposed to be as famous as Rock Wagram to come back to Fresno and sit down with him and the other boys and play poker , for he had never believed Fresno would ever again see Rock Wagram , or that he himselfwould ever speak to him in Armenian , and hear Rock speak to him in Armenian . Next to Aslan , Paul Key was thinking that if Rock couldp162come through the war all right , Paul Key could write a play even better than The Indestructibles , and Rock would appear in it and it would make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he was thinking he might never see Rock again , might never know how Rock made out in the war , might be dead before the war was over . Next to Paul Key was a man called Manuel . This man was thinking that if it was the Turks they were fighting he would feel better about it , for they were the only people he hated , since they had killed most of his family when he had been five years old , a man of thirty-five now who sometimes had difficulty about his hatred of the Turks . This happened when he remembered the Turks who had been kind to him , who had taken care of him , given him food and shelter , and even tried to give him love . At half past six the game stopped . It stopped by itself . Buck Bonapart got up to yawn . While he was doing so , Haig Vagramian got up to get himself a fresh drink . Sam Schwartz got up to see about getting a little more comfortable inside his tight pants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up . Haig had won a hundred and seventy-five dollars . Schwartz had won exactly one dollar . Buck Bonapart had won three hundred and thirty dollars . Pitcher had won fifty-five dollars . Asian had lost eleven dollars . Manuel had lost eighty-five dollars . Rock had won nine hundred and ninety dollars . Paul Key had lost a little over two thousand dollars , less than half a week 's wages . Rock spoke to Manuel , the orphan , the loser of eighty-five dollars , in Armenian . What is your city ? " he said.  | " Moush , " Manuel said . Then in English Rock said , " Cut high card for a hundred . " Rock took the deck and quickly cut to an eight . " I have n't got any more money , " Manuel said softly in Armenian because he was ashamed . " Cut , " Rock said in English . Manuel cut to a nine , and Rock handed him two of Paul Key 's fifties . They moved around the room now , talking and laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Key laugh . Paul Key had told Buck Bonapart a joke . Buck had liked the joke so much he had leaped and whirled with laughter . Sam Schwartz had seen his uncle come alive in a way that he had never before seen , and for the first time in his life he had heard Paul Key laugh as if Paul Key had the equipment for it . " What will they do next ? " Sam asked himself , deeply puzzled by what was happening to the world . Everybody stretched and joked and laughed . The game was now a thing of the past . What good is it for a man to lose his soul if he does not gain the world ? What does it profit him ? What is the joy or comfort of it ? What good is it for a man to gain his soul , only to discover that it was not worth gaining ? PAUL KEY had long ago gained the world , and lately he had also gained his soul , but what good was it ? The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul he 'd gained was poorer still . He stood in front of Fat Aram 's with Rock and Rock'sp164cousin , and with his nephew Sam Schwartz , and he said , " Good luck , Rock . " " The same to you , Paul . " He turned to Rock 's cousin . " Good luck , boy . " " Thanks , Mr. Key , " Haig said . " Mr. Key my foot , " Paul said . " My name is Paul , boy . Paul . That 's all . " He turned to his nephew . " Good luck , Sam . " " Thanks , P.K. , " Sam said . " P.K. 's chewing gum , " Paul said . " Do n't ever call me that again , Sam . Paul . " The small man , who was drunker and tireder than ever beforein his life , said , " Give my love to your family , Rock . I love them all . I love them deeply . Take care of yourself for them . Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back to lies , Rock . Take care of yourself . " " I 'll drop you off at the airport , " Rock said . " No , you wo n't , " Paul said . " This is our corner , Rock . Fat Aram 's . This is where we met . This is where we say so long . The joint 's closed , but this is the place . I loved them all . I loved them all deeply . " " We 'll meet here again , " Rock said . " Will we , Rock ? " " Sure we will , " Rock said . " Take it easy . Take it easy , Sam . So long . " Rock and Haig turned and walked across the street , to get back to the car parked in front of the hotel , Haig saying , " You worked something out , did n't you , Rock ? " Haig was speaking in Armenian when Rock heard Sam shout , " Rock ! " He turned and saw the nephew holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrying , and looked at the man 's face . " He 's all right , Sam . "  | " I think he 's dead , Rock . " " No , " Rock said . " He 's passed out . He 's drunk , that 's all . Come on . I 'll help you get him back to the hotel . Let him sleep it off , then fly back . " " Is n't he dead , Rock ? " " No . " " The way he looked at me , Rock , I thought he was dying . " " No . " They got him to the hotel , onto the couch in the room they had just left . His face was white and sticky . Haig was downstairstrying to get a doctor . At last Haig came up with somebodyold and dirty from the Emergency Hospital in the Police Department across the street . " He 's had a little to drink , " Rock said . " He 's all right , but take a look at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said , " I think he 's had a heart attack . He 's not dead , though . I 'll give him a shot , sit around a minute and see what happens . " " Shall I call Vida ? " Schwartz said . " Shall I call U.S. Pictures , Rock ? " " No . " " What shall I do , Rock ? He 's going to die . I saw him when it happened . " " He 's not going to die , " Rock said . " You never know about these small fellows , " the doctor said . " They take a lot of punishment and then something happens that would kill anybody else , but it does n't kill them . " He examined the tube and needle , jammed the needle in gently and slowly pressed the handle , forcing the fluid out . " We 'll know in a minute . In the meantime I 'll fill out this report . Who is he ? "  |p166Schwartz  was about to tell the man who his uncle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock glanced at Schwartz . He gave the man the other information he needed , and then they talked about highway accidents because that was what the man worked at for the most part . The man was ready , though , when Paul Key opened his eyes . " How do you feel ? " the man said . Paul Key tried to sit up . " Not for a moment , please , " the man said , holding him down . " I want to get to the airport , " Paul Key said . " Rock , I 'm all right . Tell him . " " He 's all right , " Rock said . " I know , " the man said . " Let 's just give it five minutes , though . " Paul Key laughed softly , closing his eyes a moment , then opening them again . " Go ahead , Rock , " he said . " You 've got to drive to San Francisco . I 'd rather you did n't wait . Take care of yourself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the hotel . Rock drove to the redbrickchurch , and went in . He crossed himself , then knelt and prayed for Paul Key . When he went back to the car the boy said , " What happened , Rock ? " " He 's dying , " Rock said . " He 's been dying for years . " " Patrick Kerry ? Who 's that ? " " Paul Key . Shut up a minute . " They drove in silence to the house on Winery Street . It was eight o'clock in the morning now . The old lady was sitting on the sofa in the parlor , a small satchel at her feet.  | " Are we driving now to San Francisco to see my daughter ? she said . " Yes , " Rock said . " Have you been waiting long ? " " I wanted to be ready . " " Let me use the bathroom , " Rock said , " then we 'll go . You 'll like the car . It 's new . Leather seats . " " Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh yes . " " If you get tired talking to me , you can listen to the radio . " " No , " Rock said . " I want to talk to you . I want to talk to you all the way to San Francisco . " Haig stood in the bedroom and talked to Rock in the bathroom , vomiting in there , trying to vomit silently . " You worked something out , did n't you , Rock ? " he said . " A lot of things , " Rock said . " Is he going to get you a deferment , so you can make a patriotic picture ? " " No . " " Did you borrow a lot of money from him ? " " No . " At last Rock came out of the bathroom . " Telephone the hotel and ask the desk about Paul Key , will you ? " " Sure , " Haig said . " Now ? " the old lady said . " Are we leaving now ? " " Right this minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door with her satchel . Their she went out onto the front porch . Rock went to the kitchen for one more look at the table where he 'd found him . Haig came from the telephone . " He 's dead , Rock . "  | " Fuck him . " " Are n't you going back to the hotel to help Schwartz ? " " No . " " Shall I go back ? " Haig said . " Get on your bike and go home and go to sleep , " Rock said . " Send me your number and everything else I ought to know . " They left the house , locking the door behind them . From the street he looked back at it . He helped the old lady into the car , then drove off , the boy on the motorcycle racing past the car to wave solemnly and disappear . Rock never saw him again . " Are your affairs in good order ? " the old lady said . " Are they going well ? " " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rock said , " was it like this ? " " This ? " Lula said . " This is no morning . " " Tell me about a morning , then , " Rock said . " When I was a girl  --  ten or eleven , the year before I got married  --  my man was a young man , " Lula said . " He was twenty-two or twenty-three . I used to get up at dawn because it was then I knew I would see him walking to the city . I used to climb to the roof and from there watch him . He knew I was there every morning . I waited for him to notice that I was there , but he only walked by . One morning , though  --  and that is the morning I am talking about  --  he looked up and noticed me . He stopped and smiled . Good morning , Lula Khanoum , ' he said . That was a morning . " " Yes , " Rock said . " Tell me all about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , headed for the river at Skaggs Bridge where he 'd gone swim/ming , where Dick Cracker , ten years old , almost twenty-five years ago , had drowned at sunset one night , trying to swim across the river with the rest of them , turning to them to say , " I ca n't make it , boys . So long , Vahan . So long , Shag . So long , Rock . " It does n't do a man any good or any harm to lose his soul or lose the world or gain his soul or gain the world . If he 's swimming the San Joaquin River , all he 's got to do is get across . All he 's got to do at any time is not drop dead . Driving across the bridge , Rock glanced at the place where Dick Cracker had drowned . He 'd been a game boy , a redheadedboy , Dikran Kirakjian . They 'd all been half-drowning . Dikran Kirakjian did n't ask any of them for help . He just turned and said so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good . All he 's got to do is not stop.  |p171What  is it that happens ?

" Can we meet somewhere for dinner , then ? " Sam said . " No . " Rock laughed to himself as he put the receiver back in its cradle . At the table at the other end of the line Sam Schwartz said to his cousin David Key , " Well , I guess they 're right all right . He 's gone crazy all right . He hung up on me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should we get up and go there ? Who does he think he is , anyway ? He has n't worked in years . " " Why has n't he ? " David said . " He 's crazy , " Schwartz said .

" He liked to give difficult people the impression that he admired them . The people he really admired were the ones he treated like dirt . The people he loved he treated like dirt . He was the most brilliant man the industry 's ever known . Everything I know I learned from P.K. He had a way with difficult people who happened to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his money out of them . What 's the best way to getp175something out of somebody ? Give him the impression you admire him . " " Yes , I suppose so , " David Key said , " but my father gave ice the impression that he admired Rock . He did n't give me that impression about very many others who visited us , and a lot of people visited us . " " Rock 's all right , " Schwartz said , " but let 's face it , he never stopped being an Armenian . " " He is an Armenian , " David Key said . " So what ? " Schwartz said . " So who cares ? " " I 've never stopped being Paul Key 's son , " David said . " I 've never stopped being a Jew , either . I like being my father 's son and I like being a Jew , Sam .

" I think I 'll go for a walk , " he said . Schwartz watched him go . " I 've been like a father to him nine years , " Schwartz said . " I 've been like a father to him since P.K. died , so what does he do to show his appreciation ? He insults me . Am I ashamed of beinga Jew ? he wants to know .

It does n't say anything in the words , and it does n't say anything in the stuff that 's not in the words . " " Well , anyway , " Myra said , " I 'm giving him a birthday party tonight .

" I 've always felt I 'd like to do what he did , " David said . " Did he do what Sam 's doing ? " " Yes , he did , " Rock said , " but Sam is n't the man your father was .

Sam tries to make bad pictures and he makes bad pictures . " " They make more money than pictures that are less bad , " Rock said . " Yes , they do , " David said . " Your father tried to make good pictures , " Rock said . " He did try . " " Did n't he try hard enough ? " David said . " It 's not as simple as that , " Rock said .

You never want to believe it ca n't be done . " " Can it be done ? " David said . " It never has , " Rock said . " What about Chaplin ? " " They 're very bad . All of them . " " Why ? " " They put sleeping , weeping people into deeper , weeping sleep . " " The last ones , too ? " " No , " Rock said . " The last ones try , they try for something , but they do n't make it . It 's not simple at all . It involves everything . " " What about the English ones lately ? " David said . " The Shakespeare pictures ? " " They 're bad . " " Everybody seems to like them . "  | " That happens . I do n't like them . Do you like them ? " " I thought I did , " David said . " Then you did , " Rock said . " I was sure I did n't . I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons and daughtersbore me . Most other people do , too . After they 've bathed and put on clean clothes and are comfortable and feel fine , they bore me .

While they 're working , while they 're struggling to get to the bath , to the table , to comfort and wellbeing , they delight me , but once they get to where they believethey will finally be all right , they bore me , for they are nothing then . Kings are always supposed to be all right , and it is a shock to discover that they are nothing . You had to try to make a picture that would make money and at the same time be good . Your father tried . He tried every time . " " What should I do ? " David said . " At the same time , " Rock said , " there 's another way of looking at it . It 's this . You decide they 're all good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one . You let it go at that . It does n't make for the worst life in the world . You should do what you like , or what you must , or what 's most convenient at the time . " " I thought my father was  --  well , a great man . " " He was greater than most , " Rock said . " There are no men who are not great . You happen to like some men enough to believe they 're the ones who are great . You happen to dislike others enough to believe they 're the ones who are n't , but actuallyany man who lives , any man who stays alive , is great . Havingstayed alive demonstrates that he is . As to the ones who die , it 's hard to say . Most likely they were great as long as they lasted . Would you pour me another , please ? "  | " I thought my father was truly great , " David said .

How many children has Sam Schwartz ? " " He is n't married . " " Well , as soon as he gets married and has children , his childrenwill know he is great . " " Maybe we do n't mean the same thing by great , " David said . " My father was a kind man . " " He was as kind as he could be under the circumstances , " Rock said . " There 's no limit to greatness or kindness . " " What 's anything mean , then ? " David said . " Not very much , " Rock said . " Your own animal health , mainly . Your own animal fun .

I 'll call between two and three if it 's all right . " " That 'll be fine , " Rock said . He stretched back on the bed and began to go over everythingagain , the half-words and half-acts left in half-places at half-times , for whatever the time of him , a man is his own proud stranger , and the luckiest one that ever was born . A man lives his life in ignorance . He lives his entire life alone , out of touch with a secret , an instantaneous thing foreverlonging to be in touch with the secret , which he believesp184is in his woman . But his woman is not his woman , and the secret is not in her . His son is not his son , and the secret is not in him . His daughter is not his daughter , and the secret is not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of touch . Each is a man 's own sad achievement , his own sad failure , his own instantaneousself , but they are not his own , as he himself knows . During the February afternoon sleep Rock Wagram drew close to the secret . When he awoke his soul wept . His sleep had been without action , without thought , but in it he had gone closer to the secret than ever before in his life . What is it ? What is the secret ? HER lawyer telephoned and said , " I just had a talk with Ann . If you want to see the children , she wants you to know you 're welcome . " " I 'll go right over , " Rock said . " I have n't seen them in a month . " " It 's the nurse 's day off , " the lawyer said . " Ann 's taking care of them . " " Then I 'll go tomorrow , " Rock said . " Are they well ? " " Ann said they 're fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call you . You can go tonight or any other time . " " I 'll go tomorrow , " Rock said . " Thanks for calling . " What is it ? What is the secret ? He began to move swiftly , for deep inside something had stopped , and he knew something would have to be done about it . What had stopped he did not know . What he was to do about it he did now know . He shaved , showered , put on fresh clothes , and went outp185into the snow . It was night now , but not yet five o'clock . He got into a taxi and went to his lawyer 's . " I saw Ann 's lawyer last night , " Rock said . " There 's to be . no legal fight for the children . She is to do what she pleases . I am to see them whenever I like , but for reasons of my own only when she 's not there . She 's there now and asked her lawyer to phone me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them tomorrow . " " What made you change your mind ? " Rock 's lawyer said .. " We were to file the papers tomorrow . " " Night before last my mother telephoned , " Rock said . " We talked an hour . There 's to be no fight for the children . She loves Ann . She understands Ann . " " Are you all right ? " " Yes , " Rock said . " I 'm going to a party Myra Clewes is givingJohn Flannery at 21 tonight . Tomorrow I 'm going to , work . I 'll take anything . I 've got to have money . " " Something seems to be the matter , " the lawyer said . " What is it ? " " I do n't know , " Rock said . " I took a nap a little while ago .. I guess I 'm still half-asleep , that 's all . " " Do you want to come to early dinner ? " " No . I want to read the play , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Everything 's off , then ? " the lawyer said . " Yes . " " If it 's what you want , Rock , I 'm glad . " " I want the kids , " Rock said , " but that 's silly . My mother told me so in Armenian . I want Ann , too , but that 's sillier still . There is no marriage , she said . There is no divorce . There is Ann , there is Rock , there is Haig , there is Lula . There is.  |p186change  . Each is each . Each is alive . Let each live , she said . Let Ann live as she pleases . My grandmother used to say the same thing . She loved Ann more than she loved anybody else in the world , except her dead husband . Ann went to my grandmother'sfuneral in Fresno . Women understand and love one another . Women married to Vagramians do , I mean . Have I got time to read this play outside in the waiting room ? " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as you like . I 'm leaving in a moment , but you stay . Stay where you are . " He was an hour reading the play . It was bad , but it did n't matter . It did n't matter any more . He would do it . What had happened ? What was it that had stopped ? He dropped the play on the leather sofa and left the office . It was one of those plays he could read once and remember forever , for there was nothing in it he needed to make a point of remembering . He walked up Fifth Avenue , turned left at 52nd , and went to 21 , to the bar , to drink alone until he saw somebody he knew . He had n't finished his first drink when he saw Myra herself . They sat down and Rock said , " I just read it . Do you want to do it ? " " Do you , Rock ? " Myra said . " Yes . " " Is it good ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to go to work the way any working-man goes to work , to get his pay . I need money . Do you want to do it ? " " Of course , " Myra said . " It 's better than we think . Besides , he 'll be on hand to work on it as we go along . I 'm delighted . What happened ? " " I took a nap this afternoon , " Rock said.  | " So what ? " Myra said . " When I woke up my whole life inside me wept . " " Why ? Do you know ? " " No , " Rock said . " Something stopped . I do n't know what it is . " " This party tonight will do you good , " Myra said . " Do you know a girl called Eve Ellis ? " " No . Why ? " " She 's going to be at the party , " Myra said . " I think you 'll like her . I mean , why not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is n't the end of the world , Rock . There are other girls . This one 's a beauty . I 'm having her sit at your table . Will you meet with me and Flannery at lunch here tomorrowto talk about the play ? " " Yes . " " One o'clock ? " " I 'd like to get away around two , " Rock said . " What 's the hurry ? " " Make it twelve to two , then , " Rock said . " Paul Key 's son David came by this afternoon . He seemed troubled and wanted to talk , but I got sleepy . This sleep wanted to happen , I guess . This is n't silly . I do n't understand it , but I know it is n't silly . I told David to call tomorrow and we 'd meet somewhere and talk . He said he 'd call between two and three . " " What sort of a boy is he ? " Myra said . " He does n't look like Paul , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's beginning to suspect his father was n't theman he thought he was . Does he know about Paul 's writing ? " " Paul had only one play produced , " Myra said . " I producedit , you appeared in it . It played two weeks to empty houses . Ido n't know whether he knows or not . I do n't even know ifp188Vida knows . Surely they must by now . They must have come across the manuscripts . " " They came across the manuscripts of hundreds of writers , " Rock said . " How would they know Patrick Kerry was Paul Key " . " You think you ought to tell David Key about his father . Is that it ? " Myra said . " I do n't know what the other things he wrote are like , " Rock said , " but I know he wrote a great play . " " Was it great , Rock ? " " Yes . " " Then why did the critics attack it ? Why did the audiences resent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and habits are cherished . It broke the habit of thinking the particular is great . It achieved a new greatness . It said something never before said . " " What did it say ? " " It said all is art , all is great , because all is indestructible . " " This party 'll do you good , " Myra said . " I 'm sure you 're going to like Eve Ellis . " " I 'll tell him , " Rock said . " I think he ought to know . He can go through the manuscripts if they have n't been thrown away and pick out the plays by Patrick Kerry and examine them for himself . I do n't think I ought to let it go . " " Do you like Richard in the play ? " Myra said . " Not at all , " Rock said , " but I 'll do it . He 'll be all right . " " You 'll help me with Flannery , wo n't you ? " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went upstairs . The party was already in progress , with eight or nine men and as many women having cocktails.  | " There 'll be about a hundred , " Myra said . " That 's Eve over there . " " She looks a little like Ann . " " Oh , Rock ! " He stood at the bar with Eve Ellis and talked . More and more people arrived , all of them people he knew . The girl was light , as Ann was , smaller , and finally not at all like Ann . She said she would like him to hear something by Mozart that she believed was the most exciting music ever composed . He said he would like to hear the music . He knew her feet would n't be Ann 's , nor anything else of hers anything at all like Ann 's . Still , it would do . He talked swiftly with almost everybody at the party , wandering around with a glass in his hand , and he knew this would do , too . He told a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had tended bar at Fat Aram 's , and he heard them laugh . He knew this would do , too , for he was trying to forget the thing that had stopped . The main course was being served when a waiter came to whisper in his ear , and the forgotten thing was instantly remembered . " Telephone , Mr. Wagram , " the waiter whispered . It was his lawyer . " San Francisco 's trying to reach you , " the lawyer said . " It 's operator 76 . " " Thanks . " It was his sister in San Francisco . " What is it ? " Rock said . " It 's Mama , Rock , " his sister said . " She 's at the St. Francis Hospital . " " What 's the matter ? "  | " I went over early this morning , " his sister said . " She was still in bed . All of a sudden Mama said , Vava , please get a doctor , I 'm dying . ' You know how Mama hates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She 's had a cerebral hemorrhage . " " I 'll take the next plane . " " I 've been with Mama every minute , " his sister said . " This morning the doctor told me not to call you . A few minutes ago he told me to call you . " " I 'll take the next plane , " Rock said . He hung up and asked a waiter to tell Myra that he had had to go . He hurried down the steps , out of the place , and to his room , where he telephoned and learned that the next plane would leave in ten minutes . He reserved a place on the one following , which left at eight in the morning . He packed , went back to the party , sat down beside Eve Ellis , and began to drink again . He took the girl home at two , got back to his room at six , showered , dressed , checked out , and went to the Waldorf for his ticket . He wired his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car to the airport and meet him . He wired Myra . He wired David Key . When the plane took off he went to sleep and slept all the way to Chicago . There was twenty minutes in Chicago , so he telephoned the Armenian doctor he had met in London when they had both been in the Army . " What do they do for cerebral hemorrhage ? " Rock said . " Nothing , Rock , " the doctor said . " What do the best men do , the ones who know what they 're doing ? " " Nothing , Rock . "  | " Who 's the best man in San Francisco ? " " They 're all the same , Rock . " His friend spoke in English at first , then in Armenian , explaininghow it was . He got back on the plane and slept or half-slept most of the way to San Francisco . No man loves anyone but himself , not even his own mother , not even his own wife , not even his own daughter , for love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this , too , is a lie , and no man loves even himself . Every man is damned , as he himself knows , and the damned hate one another , each in his own damned way . They hate one another , pity one another , regret the failure of one another . A man 's own mother happened to meet his own father at a time of hunger and need in each of them , and every wedding is a wedding of male and female needs and failings , and a lie . Every wedding is a wedding of failure to failure , one boy and one girl in love with the terrible hope of one another , the girl in love with herself and boys , the boy in love with himself and girls , the wedding itself in love with weddings and the world . But the love is damned , the wedding is damned , and so is the world . The unborn children they are in love with are damned . The longing of each of them , the boy and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is damned . The love is a lie , the wedding is a lie , the politeness is furious and brave , the tenderness is fierce and bitter , the doing of time together is fearful and beautiful . The doing of time together , winking at the posture of time , at one another , each of them flying , and time doing noth/.ing , loving nothing , hating nothing , wanting nothing , receivingnothing , giving nothing , is holy , and hell . HE was asleep on an airplane , flying through the posture of time to death , to the end of his mother , to the departure of another of his girls . The old Lula was gone three years to her husband Manuk . Ann was gone a year to safety and silliness , hats and hotel rooms . Little Lula mistook the men of the hotel rooms for her father . And now his mother was lying in a bed in a hospital in San Francisco , lying and dying , asleep in the violent sleep of dirty death , lying in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gentle and hateful strangers , her sleep clamoring with the lies she had always believed , lying there and knowing at last how all of it had been lies . Yesterday he had slept in snow , in a storm of black snow , in a bed of cold , and he 'd drawn close to the secret , which is death . Another of his girls had been struck down . Her being in him had fallen at the feet of standing time , to the bottom of time 's posture . Had n't he danced in the kitchen of the house on Winery Street , danced for joy at the smell of his girl and the bread she had baked ? That girl now fallen ? Araxi Vagramian , the daughter of Lula Karagozian who married Manuk Vagramian ? Araxi Vagramian who married Vahan Vagramian , bringing together two unlike families bearing the same name , the female side laughing at the male side for being unworldly , the male side looking down on the female side as scoundrels with good-looking daughters ? That girl fallen ? Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much trouble : a Vagramian who had contempt forp193everybody she knew , for everything she believed was important  --  clothes , hats , cosmetics , shoes , parties , nice people , famous people , exciting people , happy people , plans for parties , plans for eating and drinking and talking the rest of their lives with nice people . Ann was a year gone to the resignation of their failure , to the social smartness of their divorce , of being seven years married , the mother of two kids , still only twentyfive , still a beautiful girl , a girl with many old friends and many new ones . She was gone to safety . Lula was gone to Manuk in Bitlis by way of a weed-covered grave in the Armenian Cemetery in Fresno , Ararat . Little Lula was gone with Ann . Each had fallen , and now it was his girl Araxi , too . One by one the girls had fallen and gone . He had been at a party , sitting at a table , talking to a girl named Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a moment he was listening to his sister . " Mama 's dying , " his sister was saying . " What shall we do to keep Mama from dying , Rock ? Mama 's in the St. Francis Hospital , dying , Rock . They pierced her spine and took out fluid . It was full of blood . It was black , Rock . Mama 's not Mama any more . She 's asleep , but it 's not the way Mama slept . When she wakes up it 's not the way Mama wakes up . We talked this afternoon , but it was n't Mama the way Mama talks . She talked about the bread she was supposed to bake when she got up this morning , but did n't bake because of her head . She told me to be sure to bake the bread . She told me not to call you , Rock . She said you 've got troubles enough of your own , but the doctor told me to call . Mama 's dying , Rock . " He left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run into a girl he wanted to know . He 'd just decided to go to work.  |p194He  'd just gotten hungry for the first time in months , and wanted to eat . He 'd just decided that he had lost Ann and the children forever , and he 'd just begun to love them all the more for being lost . He 'd just begun to go back to being a son again until he could find another girl to marry and by whom to have children , and through whom to become a father again . He 'd just decided it was time to begin again . To eat , to drink , to tell jokes , to look at girls again out of the eyes of a son , to talk to them with the voice of a son , to begin again . To begin everything again , to put aside the father 's wisdom and take up again the son 's confidence that he can achieve anything . He was pleased when there was no plane until morning . " She 's dead , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest is foolishness . Araxi 's dead , too . Back to Eve Ellis , then . Back to food and drink , then . Back to the jokes , the looking and the laughing . Back to the fun of the son . " He went back and told no one , not even Myra Clewes , who said , " Is anything the matter , Rock ? " " No , Myra . " " Was it Ann ? " " No . Everything 's all right . " He would fly out and see her , talk to her , and she would be home again baking bread in a few days . When he returned to New York he would go to work . He would visit the kids when Ann was out . He would find an apartment . He would have them visit him , stay overnight , hear him talk and sing in Armenian . Lula had been almost ninety when she had died . Araxi was , only sixty-six . She was n't going to die . He 'd fly out and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more he loved Ann andp195the kids now , now that he knew they were lost , now that they were less Vagramians than New Yorkers , now that learning to speak Armenian was out of the question for them , now that he had stopped being infuriated about what was happening to them , what was going to happen to them , now that he knew that anything that happened to them would have to be consideredgood enough , and from this knowing , which would come from beginning again as a son , his old girl , Araxi Vagramian , would begin again , too , getting up and going home to bake the bread Vahan had loved so much , and her son Arak and her daughter Vava , and as long as he had lived her son Haig . He had to begin again . This time he had to begin in New York , for that was where he was , where he would be no matterwhere he happened to go . He was there in Ann , in Haig , in Lula . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years more of it , and then he would fly back to forty years more of it for himself , beginning in New York . " What happened ? " Eve Ellis said . " Where did you go ? I 've had three propositions since you left . I did n't even know if you were coming back , but I turned them down . Are you really fond of Mozart ? " His mother was n't going to die because he was going to begin again with this girl . A man 's truth is instantaneous and everlasting , marvelous and miserable . There is nothing in him which is not true , wonderful , pathetic , delightful . He is drenched in innocence . He is anything he decides he is at any moment he chooses to decide , his hat on his head . A man is an actor , as he himself knows .

A man invents truth as he goes , he invents mankind as he goes . There is no end to a man 's acting . The bounce of his acting is everlasting . The measuring of it is instantaneous and impossible . A man can not lie , can not know the truth . He can only be innocent , as he himself knows . He is a true thing come from nothing . He is a false thing come from everything , highrollingfor home . LET her be awake when I get there , he said . Let me see her . Let her see me . Let her seeing of me tell her there is time . The dough is in the tub , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her son 's daughter lives , a woman like herself , and there is time for them to go to one another , see and smell one another , speak to one another , know themselves in one another . Let her see her son and know his son lives , a man like her father Manuk , like her husband Vahan , like her son Arak , and there is time for her to see these men in Haig , and take him in her arms . There is still time for them to be alive together . Let her hear him when he tells her in words which deal in other things that there is time , time for bread , time to hear the voice of his daughter , the laughter and shouting of his son , the chanting , embracing speech of Ann , even . Let me get her up and home for twenty years more , he said . Let me get her into my old car and drive her along the ocean , highp197above the ocean , beside the sand cliffs and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , and let me speak to her in Armenian . " Would you like a blanket over your feet ? " the girl on the airplane said . " No thanks , " Rock said . " How long do we stop in Chi-cago ? " " Twenty minutes , " the girl said . I 'll do this , he thought . I 'll telephone Doc Kirmoyan and ask him to tell me what to do . Only , I know it 's the end . I know it 's death . What can the Doc tell me about that ? Araxi 's dead . She had almost thirty years more than Vahan , but twenty years less than Lula . What 's Vava going to do now ? She has her husband , her three sons , her two daughters , but what about her pal Araxi ? She used to go to Araxi 's house every morning and call out , " Araxi , are you up ? It 's Vava . " And her pal used to laugh and call back , " I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would telephone Doc Kirmoyan , anyhow . There might be something new now , a mystic powder . You take this powder and instantly it heals the broken vein . It makes all of the veins young and resilient . It was figured out by a druggist 's clerk in Cincinnati , a remarkable thing called Nu-Vein , thirtyfivecents a packet . Already he was on the phone . " Doc , what about this Nu-Vein ? " " It works , but only on people past sixty-five . " " Wonderful , Doc . She 's sixty-six . Is there anything else she ought to have ? Air ? Water ? Light ? " " Yes , those are the things . She 'll be fine . " " Now , Doc , about later . Her mother died several years ago ,  |p198almost  ninety . There was n't anything they could do . Have they got something for that ?

Too bad . " " Yes . I knew there ought to have been something . " " Yes , Rock , they finally figured it out . " " Now , Doc , after ninety , what ? " " They 're working on it , Rock . Another couple of months , another year . A lot of them when they get that old do n't want to spend the money . They want the funeral . But they 're working on it . There 's a fellow 's got a powder almost worked out , not quite white , a little gray , that seems to be effective where they want the funeral . A teaspoonful to every member of the family and they do n't want the funeral . " " Oh , it 's for the family , not for the old lady ? Is that it ? " " That 's right , Rock . That one  --  he has n't given it a nameyet  --  it has to be something polite  --  is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . What have they got for Death ? " " Oh , the usual . Everything . The mind boys are in on some new things . Anybody can get his Death in no time at all just by concentrating on it . " " No , Doc , I mean what have they got  --  what kind of mystic powder have they got that prevents it ? " " Well , they have n't got that , Rock . But what you want is Nu-Vein . It 's fine . " He turned in his seat , as if to get away from the mystic powders , saying , What 's the poor sick girl dreaming ? Do they know anything about that ? Can they guess what a dying girl dreams ?  |p199Poor  Mama , he said . Poor Araxi . Well , let her see me . Let me see my old girl before she goes . Let her see her own body 's stranger once more before she goes . A man 's truth is instantaneous and preposterous , as he himselfknows , as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posture of time to Death , to the end of his mother , to the death of the bread-maker , a man 's own girl , a man 's own mother . A man is many men . He is each of his friends and enemies , each of them going , taking him with them , as he takes them . He is the men who made him , each of them in despair about his own failure . Day-dreaming on the airplane , morning-dreaming , afternoon-dreaming , night-dreaming , sleep-dreaming , life-dreaming , death-dreaming , he wandered among the girls . HE hugged the one Myra Clewes was sure he would like , as sorrow hugs and heals sorrow , healing itself upon it , with tender arrogance and violent pity , each sorrow watching the body of the other sorrow . " This is my name , " she said . " This is my address . This is my telephone number here . This is the number where they 'll know where I can be reached when I 'm not here . I 'm writing it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " O.K. " " I mean the music itself I told you about , " she said . " I think you especially will like that music . " " I like it .

" You will keep the numbers and call , so we can hear the music itself , wo n't you ? " she said . He fished into his pocket , brought out the card , looked at the writing , and put the card in his wallet , a man flying through the posture of time , hanging onto the girls , trying not to let any more of them get away , to get lost in the crowds , or in safety , or in the grave . A man is forever asking questions . WHY did she lie ? he said . Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her away from lies ? Why did I fail ? For the sake of my children why did n't I marry the girl in Dublin ? She may not have been a liar . Why did I drive for Murphy instead of going the way my father wanted me to go ? Why did n't I learn to read and write the language and go with my father to the paper and work there ? Why did n't I work there , and buy a small vineyard around Kerman , Clovis , or Malaga ? Why did I turn away from my father ? Why did I stand on the corner of Eye and Tulare and break his heart ? What good did it do me to stand there and talk to a couple of street girls when I knew it meant to him the failure of the language itself , the failure of the word as he knew it , the failure of the people , the failure of the family , the failure of his own fatherhood ? Why did I turn away from my father ? What harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday mornings and sing the song of the alphabet or the one of morning light inp201the red-brick church ? Why could n't I have made a gift to my mother of the voice singing the songs she had known from childhood , who is now dying , who is now coming to the end ? Why could n't I have made a gift to my father of knowing his language ? He drove for Murphy because he liked Murphy . The year before he had gone to an employment agency to get a job during summer vacation . He had filled out the application . " Here under nationality , " the woman said , " you have written American . " " Of course . " " Are n't you --  ? Is n't that name , Vagramian --  ? " " Armenian ? " he said . " Of course . I was born in Fresno . I was born on Winery Street . " " Had n't I better put down Armenian ? " the woman said . " No , " he said . " I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basoglu , change the religion from Christian to Mohammedan , change the nationality from Americanto Turk . My father and his father filled out forms for the Turks long ago . They filled them out accurately , too . They were Armenians , not Turks . They were Christians , not Mohammedans . They lived in Armenia , not Turkey . If you 're going to change my nationality , let 's have some fun . I do n't want the job anyway . " Murphy said , " What are you , another Armenian ? " " That 's right , " Rock said . " Can you drive ? " " Yes . " " Fast ? " " As fast as you like . "  | " A dollar every day you drive , " Murphy said . " A dollar and a half , " Rock said . " A dollar and a quarter . " " O.K. " " Get in the car and drive , " Murphy said . " I want to go to Reedley , then to Sanger , then to Clovis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car in the garage down the street . Go home . See me at the hotel five o'clock tomorrow morning . We 've got to drive to Bakersfield and back . " Rock got into the bright yellow-green Cadillac , and drove . Murphy sat in the back . " Food is your own problem , " he said . " Girls , too . Your pay is a dollar and a quarter a day . I pay for gasoline , oil , garage , tires , repairs . " In Reedley , though , Murphy asked Rock to have lunch with him . After the drive to Bakersfield and back the next day , Murphy paid Rock two dollars instead of a dollar and a quarter . A couple of days later he paid Rock three dollars . After that he paid three dollars every day whether Rock drove or not , and when he went back to Brooklyn at the end of the season Murphy gave Rock a hundred dollars . " You drive good , Rock , " he said , " but you tell the best jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Driving for Murphy meant a lot to Rock . He liked Murphy . He liked a man who did n't keep his petty word but kept his unspoken word , lived in laughter , loneliness , and swift action , said nothing unkind to those who were false , but looked at them with contempt , amusement , and charity . The airplane flew through clouds over mountains . The traveler slept and asked questions , awoke and remembered answers.  |p203Why  did she lie ? he asked . She was driven to lying , he answered . She thought there was something better for her to be than the wonderful thing she was because snobbery had looked upon that wonderful thing as an inferior thing . She lied to reach the truth , only she got tricked along the way , and instead of reaching the truth reached other lies , the lies that kill . A man needs few material things , but he ought to have his portion of them : to eat , to see , to smell , to kiss , to sport with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The things of matter that a man needs are few , but they are magnificent things , and without them the achieving of things of nonmatteris either impossible , undesirable , or irrelevant . A man must have his portion , for a man is flesh , he comes from flesh , he inhabits it . He is not a soul , though he may have one , or several . He is swift-dying stuff , not slow-living stuff , he must have his portion , for it is little enough , as he himself knows . A man needs girls . He needs civil liberties , too , but not the way he needs the daughters of strangers . He needs humor , and he ca n't have humor if he ca n't have his portion . He needs girls , and money . He needs them in order to have the humor he needs . A 7rzan needs to take himself seriously . A man is a serious matter . He is worthless , but seriously so . His head and hide are n't worth a dime in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul is worth something , something in the neighborhood of fifteen cents . It is never off the market . If the body goes with the deal , as it does in certain contracts , in marriage , in personal appearances , in acceptances of in/vitations to dinner , in day labor , and so on , the whole soul does not go with the deal , inasmuch as no man in the world knows a soul from a hole in the ground . A good deal of a man is always out in the green , scouting around for a deal , as he himself knows , looking for the connection between the soul and the hole in the ground . ONE day when they were riding up Highway 99 to Madera Murphy said , " Do Armenians hate Armenians ? " " Some do and some do n't , " Rock said . " Some hate some and do n't hate others . Some hate most and do n't hate a few . Some hate all , and some do n't hate any . " " Jews hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , " Rock said . " I do , " Murphy said , " and I 'm a Jew . " " One , " Rock said . " Only one . " " One 's enough , " Murphy said . " I hate all Jews . " " Nah , " Rock said . " Nah ? " Murphy said . " Jews say that . Where 'd you learn that ? " " Right here in this car , " Rock said , " from you . " " I hate people who say nah , " Murphy said . " Do you hate Armenians ? " " Nah . " " Why not ? " " Like them . " " Do n't you get sick and tired seeing their faces , hearing their voices , watching them eat ? They 're always eating , are n't they ? Do n't you get sick and tired of them ? " " Nah. "  | " Nah , " Murphy said . " Do n't you think they 're silly when they go to church ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you think they 're stupid , the way they 're always trying to make grapes grow on the vines ? " " Nah . Like grapes . Like vines . Like them always trying . " " Do n't you think they 're ugly , with their ugly faces ? " " Nah . Like their faces . Like their ugly faces . Like theirhandsome faces . " " Do n't you think they 're mean , the way they push their old people around when their old people die ? " " What do they do to their old people when they die ? " Rock said . " Do n't you think it 's pretty Goddamn mean to bury them ? " Murphy said . " What else can they do with them ? " Rock said . " I 'm talking about the cemeteries where they put them , " Murphy said . " We 've got a good cemetery , " Rock said . " Ararat . All our dead are in there . " " That 's not nice , " Murphy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Putting them in the cemetery , " Murphy said . " Putting them in Ararat . Is that the mountain ? " " Yes . It 's in the Armenian flag . " " You got a flag , too . " " Yes , we have . " " What do you do with the flag ? " Murphy said . " Wave it , " Rock said . " You got a Navy ? "  | " No . Inland . " " You got an Army ? " " Six or seven . " " Who do they fight ? " Murphy said . " Each other ? " " Only in times of peace , " Rock said . " The rest of the time they fight the Turks . " " They 're no different , " Murphy said . " The Turks ? " Rock said . " Yes , the dirty Turks , " Murphy said . " They 're just as dirty as the dirty Armenians and the dirty Jews . I met a Turk once . The son of a bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied better than he did . Do n't you think it 's mean to put them in a dirty hole in the ground ? " " Nah , " Rock said . " Why not ? " " It 's the rule . " " Who made the rule ? " " It 's natural . Ashes to ashes . " " Is a man ashes ? " " Dust . " " Is a man dust ? " " Earth . " " Earth , " Murphy said . " Who made the rule ? " " I did , " Rock said . " All right , " Murphy said , . " Stop the car and get out . " Rock stopped the car and got out . It was a fine vineyard of Red Emperors , and they were ripe and ready . He went into the vineyard and took a bunch off a vine , a bunch that had three or four dozen fine large berries , each of them held firmly to its stem , the skin of each grape hard and tight , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Murphy wasp207stretching himself beside the car , feeling good . He liked to get out of the car every now and then and stretch and look around . " What you got there ? " he said . " Fine Red Emperors , " Rock said . " Bring me a bunch , " Murphy said . Rock found a fine bunch for Murphy and took it to him . " What makes them fine ? " Murphy said . " They all look alike to me . " " Large berries , " Rock said . " Good color . Good bloom . Clean stems . Skin hard and tight . These 'll keep a long time . " " Where 'd you learn all that stuff ? " Murphy said . " Driving for you , " Rock said . " Talking to the governmentinspectors . " " How long will they keep ? " Murphy said . " Most of the winter , " Rock said . " It 's a fine grape to put on the table at Thanksgiving . " " Remember this place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to the farmer , the son of a bitch . " " He may not be an Armenian , " Rock said . " Whatever he is , ' Murphy said , " he 'll be a farmer , and I 've never met people like farmers . They think this stuff 's gold . " He was eating the grapes swiftly , making a lot of noise chomping down on them and swallowing them entire , seeds and all . " It 's grapes , not gold . " " You can eat grapes , " Rock said . " What can you do with gold ? " " Do n't be a smart aleck , " Murphy said . " You can buy anything to eat with gold . " " You ca n't if there 's nothing to buy , " Rock said . " Smart aleck , " Murphy said . " Get in the car . There'sp208always farmers to grow stuff . There 's always stuff to buy . The thing to get is gold . " Rock got back into the car , behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back , still chomping down on the Red Emperors , his thick lips and big mouth making a lot of noise . " There you are , " Murphy said . He spit a grape out of his mouth into his hand . " What about this grape ? This one 's bad . " " Mildew ? " Rock said . " Rotten . " " That happens , " Rock said . " That 's what the girls in the . packing house are for . To clip off the mildewed , smashed , or rotten berries . " " Do you remember the place ? " Murphy said . " I remember it , " Rock said . " On the way back let 's stop there , " Murphy said . " You want to talk to the farmer ? " Rock said . " Farmer ? " Murphy said . " Who wants to talk to a dirty farmer ? I 'm talking about the cemetery . Do you remember the cemetery ? " " I know where it is , " Rock said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who ? " " My brother Haig , " Rock said . " He died when he was six .

Now and then a dog may die like a man , but all men die like dogs.  |p213THE  name of the Erie Railroad man was Elton Fickett . He was a vice-president . He wore a gray business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sciot , an Elk , a Woodman , and a secret riot . he was either a Methodist , a Baptist , or an Episcopalian . He was a big man , very nearly as big as Murphy himself , who was six feet tall , and 250 pounds in weight . Fickett had a clean face with clean features . His hair was gray and parted on the side . He was not bald , or beginning to be bald , as Murphy was . Murphy was n't beginning . The top of Murphy 's head , the entire crown , was clean bald , and what was left seemed tired , dry , and absurd . It would have been better if he had been all bald , clean finished with hair on his head . Murphy 's face was swarthy , and he always looked as if he needed a shave . Fickett 's face had a color that is associated with health . A man of sixty , he seemed both boyish and adult . Ile spoke in a calm , deep , and warm voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three daughters , each of whom had gone to good schools and colleges , places with names . Only one daughter , a girl of nineteen , remained unmarried . The others were married , successful in business and in society , with children of their own . The railroad man was impressive , and Rock Wagram , almostfifteen years old , was impressed by him . He seemed to Rock a real American , the first he had run into , and he was glad the man had had to do with railroads all his life , for Rock loved railroads . Fickett had come to Fresno to see some of the bigger carloadshippers of grapes . Murphy had shipped almost a thousand carloads the previous year . The cars that had not stopped at Chicago had gone to the Eastern cities over the Erie line.  |p214Mur|phy  had sent them over the Erie because one line was as good as another as far as he was concerned , and it was simple to say Erie . Fickett , however , wanted to show his appreciation for the enormous business Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to permit Murphy to look at him , to be in his presence , one of the most successful railroad men in the country , one of the most famous in railroad circles , as well as a man with social background , and offhand membership in the best clubs . Murphy , sitting beside the elegant but very manly man , was ill at ease . Murphy talked automatically , without thinking , with excitement , loudly , and with all the dirty words he needed in order to more accurately convey his meaning . Fickett talked thoughtfully , slowly , carefully . When Fickett had left his card the previous night in Murphy 's hotel box and Murphy had read it , and the message on the back of it , Murphy thought it would be a good thing to have a word with Fickett about last year 's claims . Murphy had filed them at the end of the season , claiming damages due to negligence on the part of the railroad , but nothing had come of it . About forty out of almost a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine thousand dollars . He telephoned Fickett , who suggested a meeting in the morning . Murphy explained that he had to go to Bakersfield in the morning . " When do you plan to leave , Mr. Murphy ? " Fickett said . " Five , " Murphy said . " In the morning ? " " Yes . It 's a hundred miles . I go and look things over and come back the same day . Why ? Do you want to go ? " " I 'd like to very much , " Fickett said . " At five , then . In the lobby ? " " Takes about two hours , " Murphy said . " We can have coffee before we leave , breakfast in Bakersfield . " " Very good , " Fickett said . " I look forward to meeting you . " Now , at half past five , Fickett had met Murphy , Murphy had met Fickett , and Rock Wagram was watching both of them in the rear-view mirrow of Murphy 's Cadillac , crossing the railroad tracks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Murphy said , " because it 's cool early in the morning . Also , I ca n't sleep . " " Is that so ? " Fickett said . " Have you tried a warm bath before bed ? " " No . Is that good ? " " I find it relaxing , " Fickett said . " I made the discovery thirty years ago . A bath before bed , a shower on rising . " It seemed to Rock that Murphy was trying to remember if he had taken a shower on rising , or if perhaps he smelled a little anyway . " That 's a lot of bathing , " Murphy said . " I find it well worth the time it takes , " Fickett said . " Ten minutes at night , ten minutes in the morning . " " What do you do ? " Murphy said . " You take the bath and go to bed , and then you go to sleep ? Is that it ? " " Warm water , " Fickett said . " A tubful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , " Murphy said . " Yes . Not hot . Not cold . " " Puts you to sleep ? " " Relaxes you , so you can fall asleep . " " You sleep well ? "  | " Quite well . " " Every night ? " " Yes . I assure you it 's an excellent treatment for insomnia , Mr. Murphy . " " Maybe you have n't got any worries , " Murphy said . " Oh , I have my responsibilities , " Fickett said . " I do n't take them to bed with me , though , because I 've found that I ca n't do justice to my work the next day if I lie awake all night . Work when it 's time to work . Play when it 's time to play . Sleep when it 's time to sleep . " " I work all the time , " Murphy said . " I work when it 's time to work , when it 's time to play , and when it 's time to sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his box because he had a settlement of the damages to report , and he believed the amount of the settlement would be made known after a few minutes of small talk , but even after they had reached and passed Tulare the talk was still small , although it was no longer about bathing , sleep , work-time , and play-time . It was about the kinds of people in the world , as Fickett understood the matter , his voice calm and deep , his face clean and relaxed . Rock Wagram watched and listened . He watched the road carefully , too , because he was driving around seventy , but there was little traffic , except trucks loaded with grapes on their way to packing houses , so he was also able to watch the faces of the men as he saw them reflectedin the rear-view mirror . They could scarcely notice that he was watching them . He listened very carefully . He still admired Fickett , but he found that as time went on he admired Murphy much more , a man it had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nature seemed to insist on no admiration , seemed in fact to demand that there be none , a man for whom it was easy to work , whose presence it was inevitable to enjoy , whose swiftness and richnessof mind it was refreshing to notice . Twenty or twenty-five miles past Tulare , Rock still admiredFickett , but it was nothing to the affection he felt for Murphy . " It takes all kinds to make a world , " Fickett said . " I have associates who have lost patience with this people or that , generalizing about all of them solely on the basis of experience with a handful of them  --  a hundred or so . The Italians , for instance . Hot-headed , excitable , emotional , overwrought , occasionallyhysterical , but for all that , as far as my own experiencehas been , lovable , child-like , and deeply honest , however confusing some of their behavior may sometimes be . I have given this matter thought , and my conclusion is that this behavior is the result of high spirits , a love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't expect their demands to be met , and they only pretend to be astonished when their demands are not met . " " That 's the Italians ? " Murphy said . " As far as my own experience has been , " Fickett said . " They are a people who sing . Hearty . Spontaneous . " It was here that the admiration Rock Wagram felt for Elton Fickett began to go . Who asked you ? Rock thought . If you 're going to talk about people , talk about your own , whoever they are , because you know them , and do n't know other people . " The Scotch , on the other hand , " Elton Fickett said . " The popular misconception about the Scotch is that they are tight/fisted , stingy , miserly , dour , severe , excessively money-loving , thrifty to the point of impracticality . My own experience with the Scotch , however , leads me to believe they are sober , serious-minded , dignified , and honorable . " " They 're nice people , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what Murphy really wanted to say was something dirty and accurate about Elton Fickett himself . " The French , " the man went on . " The absurd misconceptionhere is that the Frenchman thinks of nothing but coarse pleasure , food , drink , and so on and so forth . My own experience with the French , however , tells me that they are cultivated , refined , and devoted to the highest ideals of westerncivilization . " Rock noticed that Murphy was becoming uneasy , waiting with apprehension for this authority 's verdict on the Jews . " I make it my business to find out the truth about people for myself , " Fickett said . " I 'm not interested in what the majority of people think of one people or another . That 's their business . I will acquaint myself with what they think , solely as a guide , but that is all . The Jewish people , for instance . The vast majority of the public is convinced that the Jewish people are materialistic , clever , aggressive , overbearing , demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Fickett smiled , then said , " My own experience tells me that the Jewish people are intelligent , quick to adapt themselves to a new environment , a new tradition , a new order , a new trade or profession . They have speed , plus patience , a rare combination . They love good things , the things money can buy . Good homes , good clothes , good cars , good investments . I have always admired the Jewish people . I marvel at theirp219cunning in the achievement of good . I take off my hat to them . " He removed his hat , apparently by accident , and began to fan himself with it . Murphy , uncomfortable and bewildered , removed his hat , too , and also began to fan himself . What a crook ! Rock thought . What a clean-cut crook ! In the rear-view mirror he noticed that Murphy was dying like a dog , and in the airplane , more than a quarter of a century later , Elton Fickett long since dead , Murphy himself long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , sooner or later , every man dies like a dog , moaning and wagginghis tail . A man is a born liar who can not tell a lie . A man can be a decent animal . His friends are meaningless unless they are decent animals . But a man 's friends are polite and lying animals , as a man himself knows . There is never a lie in the life of any animal that is worth being told , or any truth that is worth being concealed . Thus , in the end , a man 's best friend is his money , his tobacco , his whisky . A man 's best friend is his feet , his hide , and his head . A man 's best friend is his own time . His best friend is the sun , the very same which made light and heat for his father , and for his mother : the same that shined on him when he was no older than his son , on whom it shines now . A man is a born liar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his best friend is his own animal which can not lie , but may lie down in the heat of the afternoon , in the shade of a tree , and be there , be a friend there , be alive a moment there , halfasleepand half as if he had been there all the time . A man'sp220own brother can not be his friend , but a man can be the friend of his poor world and time . There is no truth for a man , there is no friendship for him except the truth of the sun , the friendshipof time , his own personal sun and his own personal time . There is nothing to say of these things . They are there and a man is there , and there 's his truth and there 's his friendship . ON the airplane , he woke up with a start and looked for somebody in uniform , for they were the ones who had the needed information . They were the ones who started elevators with castinets , who kept fools behind ropes outside moving picture theatres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors of taxis at hotels , restaurants and fashionable saloons , who knew the answers . He saw one in uniform , and called to her . She came to him , beside him , upon him , as if to be embraced , her eyes and lips smiling a little , which is the way of them on airplanes , and she said , " Yes , Mr. Wagram . " She spoke softly , as if they were somewhere where this might be explored , worked upon , given any life it might be entitled to . " Will you tell me when we will reach San Francisco ? " he said . " We 're on time , " she said . " Even so , " he said . " When will we reach there ? " " At half past five , " she said . " It 's almost half past four now . You 've had no lunch . You were asleep , and I thought it best not to disturb you . " " I had coffee and doughnuts in Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No thanks . " " Magazine ? "  | " What magazine ? " " National Geographic , Esquire , Secret Stories . " , " They still publishing Secret Stories ? " he said . " Somebody who got off at Chicago left an old one on his seat , " the girl said . " February , 1930 . I 've been looking through it . Would you like to look through it , too ? " " No , I think I 'd better not , " Rock said . " What sort of secrets were they ? " " You know , " she said . " Love , marriage , lies , adultery . " " You like this work ? " Rock said . " Love it . " " You like travel ? " " People , " she said . " I 'll sit down a minute if you do n't mind . " " Please do , " Rock said . " What do you like about them ? " " Oh , I do n't know , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't dislike them , " Rock said , " but mainly they breakmy heart . " " Why ? " she said . " They 're always lying , or dying , " Rock said . " They tell lies all their lives , and then they die . As long as they 're alive , I do n't mind the lies , but when they die , the lies break my heart . " " What do you mean by lies ? " she said . " Like a girl tells her boy friend she loves him , then two-times him ? " " That example 's all right , " Rock said , " but it 's not what I mean . Have you had any experience at all with cerebral hemorrhage ? " " What do you mean ? " the girl said . " Have I had one ? " " No , " Rock said . " Have you known anyone who 's had one ?  |p222A  grandfather , or somebody your father knew . How is your father ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . We 've had some experience with heart . Attacks , you know . On the plane , I mean . Had a man die on us one time between San Francisco and Chicago . We came down of course to get him to a doctor , but he was dead . " " Does he worry about you ? " Rock said . " I mean , you 're not much more than twenty-one or twenty-two . " " I 'm twenty-four , " the girl said . " Of course he worries about me . He thinks being a hostess on an airplane is a foolish career for a girl , but I do n't expect to be a hostess all my life . " " What do you expect ? " Rock said . " You know . " " You mean to get married ? " " Of course . " " To somebody you meet on an airplane ? " " Just the first time on the airplane , " she said . " Oh yes , " Rock said . " Meet later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the girl said . " Although we did have a girl whogot married on an airplane . Publicity , of course . Miriam . " " What 's your name ? " " Miriam . Hers was , too . " " Well , I guess if she could do it , you can do it , too . What 's your last name ? " " Schwarzschild . Is n't it awful ? " " Not at all . You are a dark child . " " I 'd love to change it , though . Miriam Merlin . " " You know somebody named Merlin ? " " No , but I like to put Miriam with other names . You know . " " How about Miriam Morgenthau ? "  | " All that money ? " the girl said . " What money ? " Rock said . " Was n't he Secretary of the Treasury ? " " I guess he was at that , " Rock said , " but the money was n't his , was it ? " " Well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , I do n't like Morgenthau with Miriam . " " Is your mother well ? " " Oh , swell . " " Have n't you ever heard anybody speaking about somebody who had had a cerebral hemorrhage and got over it all right ? " " A cyst , " she said . " I heard about a cyst once . " " No , that 's something else , " Rock said . " The veins get brittle , or a vein is weak someplace , and if the blood pressure has been high , and then gets higher , well , wherever the vein is weakest it breaks . " " Do you want some gum ? " " No . Why ? " " It helps when you ca n't hear , " the girl said . " I just said a cyst is n't serious . " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " Rock said . " I guess I 'll have some gum , after all . I did n't hear you . " He received the packet containing two Chiclets from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a saliva he had n't tasted in years , a hot , sick saliva , and he knew instantly when it had been . He had come home from school to find his father consoling his mother because his brother Haig was dead . He went into the room in which they both slept , and looked at his brother , and saw that Haig was dead . His father was walking in and out of the rooms of thep224house with his mother , and his sister was following them . He sat on his own bed and looked at his brother in the other bed . He never did know how or why he took the wrapping away from the two sticks of gum and got them into his mouth and began to chew , making the hot , sick saliva , the same saliva that was in his mouth now . " Haig , " he said . He did n't cry . His father did n't , either . It was just his mother and his sister Vava crying . His father was saying her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed , looking at his brother 's face , chewing the gum , as he was chewing it now , swallowing enormous mouthfuls of hot saliva . " God damn you , Haig ! " he said . " Araxi , " his father said . " What did you say , Mr. Wagram ? " the girl said . " Oh , " he said . " I wonder if I might look at that copy of Secret Stories , after all ? " " I 'll get it for you , " the girl said . " It 's a scream . All lust , adultery , and murder , you know . " She brought him the magazine and said , " It 's been awful nice talking to you , Mr. Wagram . " He took the magazine and opened it somewhere near the middle , looking at the print , but not reading . " Araxi , " he said , the hot saliva pouring down his gullet . He stepped out into the aisle to the open area just behind his seat , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and tried to drink away the taste of death in his mouth . He drank many cups of water , eight or nine at least , but when he sat down again the taste was still there , for a man 's own brother can not be his friend , and a man can not be a friend to his own mother when she has reached the quarrel with her own time , a man is helplessand he can do nothing but chew gum , look at the blurredp225print of Secret Stories , and swallow as hot saliva the lie that was her life , the truth that is her death . The only thing a man does all his life is breathe . The instant he inhales he is alive , the instant he exhales but does not inhale again he is dead . A man is very nearly everything the first time he inhales , he is very nearly nothing the last time he exhales , but between the first inhale and the last exhale a man is many things , and the things he does are many and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathes all the time . No matter what else a man does he also breathes . Breathing 's what a man is . He is born to breathe . His life is a life of breathing . A man 's appetite for air is everlasting . He stops breathing with violence . A man wants air to breathe , he wants the ability to breathe to stay with him , but in the end , in the time of his own end , every man is denied , he is denied the air he wishes to breathe , he is denied the ability to breathe , he stops breathing , he can laugh no more . Never again can he look at something and see it : at a face and see a face : at a tree and see a tree : at a sky and see a sky : at the sun and see the sun . Never again can he reach out to the things which are and touch them . Never again can he listen and hear : the cryingof his infant son , the laughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , the whispering at night of his woman . Let him be denied air to breathe and it is neveragain for him . Let the miracle of breathing be denied him , and though the earth be filled with the scent of water , grass , leaf , blossom , bee , and butterfly , it is never again for him . There will be no more dandruff from his head , no more junk for him to accumulate , no more gadgets to operate . He will make no more debris , he will be debris , he will be the originalp226debris , silver and gold in his dead teeth . Never again will he be a man who could stand on a street corner , look around , and speak to somebody . Never again will he be a king , a commanderin chief , a millionaire , a vice-president in charge of production , a philanthropist , a labor leader , a locomotive engineer , a poet , an actor , a convict , a warden , a preacher , a doctor , a dentist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , a father , a good man , a bad man , a man of truth , a man of honor , a man of dignity , a crook , a deceiver , a sneak , a liar . If he ca n't breathe , he ca n't be anything but debris . If he ca n't breathe , he ca n't love anyone or hurt anyone . He ca n't get into a car and drive , he ca n't take a train , he ca n't get into an airplane , he ca n't get aboard a ship , he ca n't ride a bicycle , he ca n't walk . He ca n't stand to walk . He ca n't sit . He ca n't lie down . He ca n't sleep , he ca n't sleep worth a damn any more . His memory fails him . He does n't seem to remember anything any more . He has no taste for meat or bread or wine or water any more . He does n't care which pair of shoes he puts on his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't he go another way than by foot ? Worst of all he ca n't laugh any more . He ca n't joke any more . He ca n't tell stories any more . He ca n't talk any more . He ca n't understand the alphabet any more . He ca n't say cat . He ca n't talk with words and be saying at the same time other things than what the words are saying , funnier things , better things , more loving things , kinder , gentler , more gently wicked than the violent wickedness of literalness . Something 's happened . He 's exhaled and he ca n't inhale any more . It is the end . It is the end of the world he was . It is the end of being out of touch . That which he knew would happen has happened . A man is dead , he is dirt , he is given a funeral , he is buried , he is no more , and never again will he go there.  |p227THE  airplane came down in San Francisco . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down , and across the asphalt pavement to where they stood : his sister Vava , her husband Sark , their son Joe . He walked slowly to the gate where they stood , not letting them know that long ago he had noticed their faces . He looked at each , said their names , walked with them to the waiting room , and out to where the baggage would be distributed . He handed Joe his baggage checks . They walked again and came to the car , his old Cadillac . After everybody had been seated he got in , taking his place behind the wheel . " Rock , " his sister said . " It was yesterday morning . The night before we 'd gone to an engagement party and Mama felt fine and had a wonderful time . " " Wait , " he said . When they were on the highway he said , " Vava , how 's Mama ? " " She 's better , " Sark said . " She 's much better . " " How is she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " his sister said . " She 's going to be all right , " Sark said . " Mama 's a strong woman . She 's much better , Rock . " " Who spent the night with her ? " Rock said . " I did of course , " his sister said . " They put a cot in the room for me , but I did n't sleep . " " How is she , Vava ? " " I do n't know , " his sister said . " Sark came to the hospital a couple of hours ago to get me . She was sleeping then and Sark thinks she 's better . Dovey 's with her now . She sleeps most of the time , wakes up for a few minutes , says a few things , goes back to sleep . "  | " She 's much better , " Sark said . " Who 's the doctor ? " Rock said . " Lowell , Mama 's regular doctor . " " What 's he say ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Has he tapped her spine again ? " " Yes . This afternoon . " " How was it this time ? " " Not as black maybe . " " What 's the shortest way to the St. Francis , Sark ? " " Come to our house first , " Sark said . " Relax , take a shaveand a shower , have a bite to eat , then we 'll go visit Mama . " He turned to the boy beside him . " What 's the shortest way , Joe ? " " Straight ahead to West Portal , " Joe said . " I 'll tell you after that . " " Do you want me to drop you at your house , Sark ? " " No , but Mama 's much better , " Sark said . " Mama 's going to be home in eight or nine days . " " Sure she is , " Rock said . " I want to see her . I want to talk to Doctor Lowell . Is he around now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister said . " He goes home at six . His office is across the street from the hospital . He visits Mama every hour or so . You know how he loves Mama . He had tears in his eyes this afternoon . " " What 's Mama say ? " Rock said . " Well , Rock , I do n't think she knows what 's happened , " his sister said . " She 's got a tubful of dough that 's ready for baking , and every time we 've talked she 's talked about it . Sometimes just a few words , sometimes all the time . She 's toldp229me exactly what to do . Half the dough is for flat bread , half for small loaves . A bread-man for Haig , a bread-woman for Lula , a flower loaf for Ann , and a star loaf for you , Rock . Every time she makes bread she makes those , too . How are they ? " " They 're all well , " Rock said . " You need a shave , Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ought to stop and shave . " Rock turned around , even though the car was traveling swiftly . He looked at his brother-in-law . There were tears in his sister 's eyes . It was his brother-in-law 's nature to hold fast to anything that he believed in , and he wanted to hold fast to the theory now that Rock should stop at his house before goingto the hospital . This happened every time Rock and his brother-in-law met . " Give me a cigarette , will you , Sark ? " he said . The man held out a package which Rock took . They were Camels , which he did n't like , and he had Chesterfields , which he did like , in his coat pocket . He removed a cigarette , lighted it , and began to smoke . The boy beside him took one , too . They drove on in silence a minute or so . " Mama 's only sixty-six , " Vava said . " Sixty-six is nothing any more , Rock . " " What 's the nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are very good , " Vava said , " but you know what nurses are . It 's a job for them . They talk about it that way . " " Three of them ?

She 's the one who comes on at midnight . She 's deaf . " " Does Mama like them ? " " They 're strangers , Rock , but they 're very nice , too , and they know what they 're doing . They move her in bed , and work with pans , and massage her forehead and her wrists , and they sit there and read . " " What do they read ? " Rock said . " Movie magazines . " " Every one of them ?

She 's the best . " " There was n't anything like that in her movie magazine , was there ? " " She did n't mention it . Do n't you think , Rock , you ought to go back with Ann and the kids ?

" I ca n't live with a liar . I can love her , but I ca n't live with her . " " Ah , " his sister said . " What 's lying ? Who cares ? " " I care , " Rock said . " I did n't divorce her . I gave her the divorce because she wanted it  --  she would n't have lied if she had n't wanted it . I gave it to her because I always gave her whatever she wanted .

" " You should , Rock , " his sister said . " Work is life , Rock . If I did n't work every day in my house , in my garden , I 'd die . Work is life . I do n't think Mama should have spent so much time these past ten years reading The Asbarez and all the other Armenian papers and magazines and books that come to her . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Mama works all the time , too . " " Not the way she used to , " his sister said . " Her house is the easiest in the world to keep . Nobody but herself to take care of and cook for . Triola fools around in the garden every Saturday for three hours . Once a month Mama has a big baking , and once a week a little one . The dough that 's ready now is for a big one . I 'm coming over sometime tomorrow to bake the bread and take some of it to her . Just to see , of course . She ca n't eat . If she eats , she vomits . Your apartment downstairs is in order . All your junk is there , and I gave the place a thorough cleaning . There 's logs in the garage , and I 've got everything set in the fireplace for a fire . Have you got your keys to the house ? " " I 've got them , " Rock said . They came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked around . " Is that the building where Doctor Lowell 's office is ? " he said . " Yes , " his sister said.  | " Joe , " he said , " will you please go up and see if he 's in . If he is , will you ask him to please wait a moment , as I want to talk to him . Then come to Mama 's room . " " O.K. , " the boy said , and bolted across the street . They went into the place , rang for the elevator , got in , went up to the third floor , and walked softly down the long corridor to the last room . " I 'll peek in first , " his sister said . She pushed the door open , looked in , then nodded to Rock that it was all right . The room was no place to be of course , but there was n't anything anybody could do about that . The nurse was sitting beside the bed , reading a magazine that probably was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse , but perhapsnot intentionally , just to be comfortable . She had n't heard him . He moved along the bed and saw her an instant before she saw him , the woman in whose kitchen he had danced thirty-five years ago when she had been baking bread . Her hair was gray now , and very dry , hair that he had never thought of as having been anything but black . There was still a good deal of black in it , but not the black that he remembered . Her face seemed larger , hot and swollen . When she saw who it was she was astonished . She sat up , and instantly the nurse was out of her chair , to help hold her up . Her eyes were still the same , but everything else was changed . He took her in his arms very slowly , kissed one cheek and then the other . He took her hands and kissed them , then held them tightly , looking into her eyes , for she was his girl , she was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them go . " Where you come from so quick , Rock ? " she said in English , for she tried not to speak Armenian when there were those nearby who could not understand the language.  | " I came from New York , Mama . " " Why you come all the way from New York , Rock ? " " I came to see my girl , " he said . His mother laughed as a girl laughs , then turned to the nurse . " Miss Gillen , " she said , " you know who this is ? This is my son . Rock Wagram . " " Yes , " the nurse said softly . " I recognized him , Mrs. Va-gramian . " " Is it all right for her to sit up a moment ? " he asked the nurse . " Yes , " she said . The nurse placed two pillows behind his mother , so that she need n't make an effort to stay up . " Ilow is your wife , Rock ? " his mother said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - low is your son , Rock ? " " He 's fine , Mama . " " How is your daughter , Rock ? " " She 's fine , Mama . " He saw her eyes fill with concern , as they searched through his eyes and along the lines and outline of his face and head . " You excuse me , Miss Gillen , " she said , " I going to talk in Armenian . " " Oh , Mrs. Vagramian , " the nurse said . " Please . " " Arak , " his mother said in Armenian , " how are you ? You , yourself . " " Araxi , " he said , " do not worry about me . I am well . " " You are tired , Arak ? " " No . " " You are finished with the lawyers ? "  | " Yes . " " In family affairs it is no good to have lawyers , Arak . " " I know , " he said . " I got angry . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I know . " " I 've got a tubful of dough at home for bread , " she said . " Vava will make you some fresh bread tomorrow . You sit down quietly at your table , and you eat fresh bread with butterand honey and tea . " " Yes , Mama . " " You be a good boy and send your beautiful wife money . " She looked at him severely and then said , " Let Ann do anything she wants to do . What do you care ? You be a good boy , let your children love their mother , let their mother enjoyherself , let her be beautiful , let her put on the clothes she loves so much and go out and have fun and laugh and talk and be happy . Ann is that kind of girl , Arak . You just be a good boy . You do your work and send her money . Is there something else honorable a man can do ? You do not do this because you must do it , you do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with love , not with anger and hatred . You love Ann , no matter what she does . Ann is the mother of Haig and Lula , Arak . She is always the mother of your children . You love her . " " All right , Mama . " He laughed inwardly because he believed she must be all right if she could give him instructions . He had something important to tell her when Sark came in and stood behind him . His mother and Sark greeted one anotherand then the nurse said , " I think she 'd better lie back and rest now , Mr. Wagram. "  | " Yes , " he said . The nurse took away the two pillows and eased his mother down . Rock kissed her hands again and then said in Armenian , " Just rest , Mama . Do n't think about anything . I 'll be here tonightwith Vava . " He left the room feeling deeply glad , for he did not know that he would never speak to her again . His sister and her husbandand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She seems all right , " Rock said . " But I want to have a talk with Doctor Lowell . Let 's none of us go back in there for a while . Let her rest . " " He 's waiting in his office , " Joe said . They walked down the hall , took the elevator , and left the building . He visited the doctor alone . " How about it ? " he said . " I just left her . She seemed all right , but please tell me exactly what it is . " " Anything can happen , Rock , " the doctor said . " You mean she 's not recovering ? " Rock said . " We talked a minute or two and she seemed fine . " " I 'm delighted , Rock , " Dr. Lowell said . " The next twentyhourhours will tell . It 's one of those things . We can only wait and hope . Will you ask the family not to go in there from now on ? " " Should n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , " the doctor said , " but she must rest and stay calm , Rock . Please let 's all of us let her rest during the next twenty-four hours . " " My sister wants to spend the night on the couch , " Rock said . " I want her to , " Dr. Lowell said . " That 's important . Your mother speaks in Armenian frequently and it 's important forp237the nurse or myself to know what she says , and your mother needs to know that Vava 's there . " He talked with the doctor a half hour , asking every kind of question the answer of which he believed might be helpful , but there were no answers . Something had happened . They would know in twenty-four hours the meaning of what had happened . They would have to wait . It had happened inside her skull , without warning , somethingthat might not have happened , something that had not happened to her own mother . It was a secret thing , and it could have a swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could still see and talk and touch and remember and think and tell her son the things she believed to be the truth . Another secret thing , a hundred thousand more secret things wouid be happening to her in the next twenty-four hours , and after they had all happened , he would know if she would go on breathingten or twenty years longer . His mother was still herself , still his mother , still Araxi , still his girl , and she was still breathing . He believed she would get up from her hospital bed and go home and mix flour and warm water and salt and yeast and melted butter into a dough and bake bread , and he would sit at the table and eat the bread . She was still breathing , and he believed she would go on breathing . A man 's coming and going is lonely and secret , and yet all of his going and coming seems to have been with companions , strangers who fell in beside him because they were comingor going , too , strangers he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who spoke or who listened , and yet a man was always alone , and the stranger who was an instantaneous friend was also alone.  |p238A  man has no years . He is instantly and continuously himselfand that flash of time which is the moment coming to him , reaching him , and leaving him . He has no years , for a man can not cease to be who he is until he is dead and who he is is who he is instantly , standing there , holding the hands of his dying mother , looking into her eyes , saying something to her without words , saying something with words , something that means something more than what the words say , saying to her , " Hang on , Mama , there 's nothing better to do if you can do it . There 's nothing better than to read the Armenian papers that come every morning . But if you ca n't hang on , do n't regretanything . Do n't regret the deterioration of each of us .

" I have this woman , this girl , who is my mother , who carried me inside her flesh , and a secret thing has happened to her that I know must happen to every woman , every girl , every man 's mother . I would rather this thing did not finish this woman now , for I believe she does not wish it , and there is more for her to read .

His sister was there , standing over her mother , watching her sleeping face . The nurse was not there . She was out for a cup of coffee . " She 's in a coma again , " his sister said . " It happened a couple of hours ago . Is Mama dying , Rock ? " " No , " he said . " Rock , is she dying ? " " No , this is part of what we 're waiting for . " " Do you understand these things , Rock ? " " No . " " Old Lula lived to be almost ninety , Rock , " his sister said . " Mama 's a strong woman . There 's never been a stronger woman than Mama . Does she look as if she 's going to cone home , Rock ? Does her face look like the face of somebody who 's going to stay ? " Her face did not look like the face of somebody who was goingto stay . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been born . That was an angry face , the face of a man who was going to stay . he remembered his daughter 's facep240when his daughter had just been born . That was a petulant face , all twisted out of shape because she was a woman just out of a woman , and it was a face of a woman who was going to stay . His mother 's face did not look like the face of somebody who was going to stay . Her face said one thing , " Now I am altogether alone . I have seen it all . It was all unfortunate . I regretit , I pity it . I sleep . I am alone . I am going . " " Does Mama look all right , Rock ? " " I never saw her when she did n't look as she looks now , " he said .

" " I 'm sorry about Sark in the car , " his sister said . " I 'm sorry about that , Rock . " " He only wanted Mama to see me looking well , " Rock said . " What did Mama say ? " his sister said . " What did she say to you , Rock ? " " The things she has always said , " he said . " Listen , Vava . I want to have another talk with the doctor . Where is he ? " " He was here an hour ago , " Vava said . " He 's done everything he can do . We 've just got to wait , he said . He 's home . " " I 'll telephone him , " Rock said . " I 'll be back in a minute . " He went downstairs because he did n't want to use the telephone in the room , did n't want his sister to hear his questions . " What is it ? " he said . " I would n't tell any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but it is n't good , Rock . She went into a coma soon after she spoke to you . We decided not to tell her you were coming . It was my idea . "  | " Is it fifty-fifty ? " Rock said . " No , Rock , " the doctor said , " but we do n't know very much about dying , about who dies , and when , and how . It 's different each time . From what we do know it is n't fifty-fifty . I 'm hopingshe 'll come out of it . Her temperature is n't down . It 's up . I 'm hoping the next twenty-four hours will see a miracle happen . " " A miracle ? " " Yes , Rock . She 's still bleeding . It may have stopped for a few hours . She may be bleeding from another part of the vein now , or even from another vein . I think she knew you would be coming and was waiting for you . I 've been her doctor almost ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something wonderful I could say that you could pass along to the rest of the family . I 'm coming by again in an hour or so . " " What is her temperature ? " Rock said . " It 's never been lower than a hundred and four , " the doctor said . " Was it a hundred and four when she spoke to me ? " Rock said . " Yes , or higher , " the doctor said . " I think she was waiting to see you and speak to you . She herself may not have known it . I ca n't otherwise account for her not having gone into a coma earlier . " " Is she in pain ? Herself ? " " Well , she 's in a coma , and she 's supposed to be insensitive to pain , but we do n't know about that , either . I do n't know , Rock . " " What about surgery ? " Rock said . " I had one of the best men in early in the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help . Will you be there ? "  | " Yes , " Rock said . He was there when the doctor took some more fluid from her spine . " I do n't know , " the doctor said . " There 's no telling . " They went out into the hall and talked , then into the street . The doctor went home . Rock went back upstairs and stood over the bed and watched his mother 's face . " What 's he say , Rock ? " his sister said . " What 's the doctor say ? " " We have to wait , " Rock said . At two in the morning he went out into the street , then drove to the house he 'd built for her . There were three Armenianpapers on the table in the hall : The Asbarez from Fresno , The Hairenik from Boston , and Nor Giyonk from Paris : Horizon , Homeland , and New Life . There would be other papers , too , from other cities . The print would not stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asbarez , sat in the chair in the hall , and read it for half an hour , as if he were able to read . He looked at the print of each word as if he were reading . He then went downstairs to his apartment and wanderedaround there among his junk . There beside the fireplace was the pianola he 'd bought years ago because he had heard pianolas in Fresno , at three weddings of members of his family , and she had always liked that music . There were the shelves filled with the books he had accumulated over the years . There was the framed picture of his father , thirty-three years old , the ends of his moustache curved upward , his eyes intense . There was the framed picture of all of them together : Vahan , Araxi , Arak , Vava , and Haig . He put a match to the paper of the waiting fire in the fireplace , turned off the light , sat in the chair that had been hisp243father 's , and watched the fire until it was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tubful of dough and smelled the dough .

He got up after a couple of hours , shaved and showered and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , still hanging in the closet of his bedroom . It was half past seven when he got to her room . His sister sat up in bed , still asleep . " She awoke twice during the night , " she said , " but I do n't know , I do n't know , Rock . " " What did she say ? " Rock said . " Well , once she said , Shame , ' " his sister said . " That 's the fight I had with Papa that time , " Rock said . " I did n't want to fight him . I 'm sorry , Vava . " " Oh , Rock , " his sister said . " That was n't your fault . She said some other things , too . Names , I mean . Names I do n't know . I guess they 're people she knew in the old country .

I do n't think she saw me . I 'm sick , Rock . I 'm scared . " She began to sob softly . " I want to go home , " she said . " I want to see my damn kids . " " I 'll take you home , " Rock said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is it ? Did you ever see such kids as my kids ? All big and smiling , all good ? " She pointed at the woman on the bed .

The stupid dark of this room . These stupid walls . " She suddenly burst into terrible sobbing . " I want to take Mama home , " she said . " For God 's sake , Rock , let Mama die in her own bed , in her own house . " She stopped suddenly , ashamed and angry at herself . " I 'll go out until you get dressed , " Rock said . " I 'll take you home . " " No , " his sister said . " I 'll take a taxi . You stay here . I 'll send Dovey . Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood at the window looking down at the hospital parking lot , where the doctors left theirp246cars . There was only one car in the whole lot , space for twenty-four . Further off , hanging on a clothesline , were two pairs of a man 's winter underwear , three shirts , four pairs of socks , and a woman 's skirt and blouse . There were other lines , but without things hanging on them . His sister came out of the room . " I thought I 'd telephone the priest , Zadik , " she said . " You remember him . He was at the engagement party the other night that Mama had such a fine time at . I thought I 'd telephonehim to get his cross and robe and cap and book and come here . " " Yes , " Rock said .

" " All right , Rock , " his sister said , and went . Rock went back into the room and looked at her face again . It was another face altogether now . The pride , the regret , the compassion , the resignation , the pity were all gone . They had been driven out of her face by the pain of death , by the secret struggle of a woman with death . Still , he believed she might come to the miracle the doctor had spoken of . She might struggle through the pain and away from the death . The nurse now was the German one , the deaf one , a woman older than his mother.  | " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't asked . " She 's not in pain . " His niece came , a big girl with a sweet face , now bewildered and hurt . Rock went off to the church and found the priest Zadik inside , waiting . They spoke in English , then in Armenian , the priest explaining that in the Armenian church there was no hell , but not saying there was also no heaven . He explained the difference between what he would soon do and what a Roman Catholic priest would do . They went upstairs and Rock 's niece got the nurse out of the room , then came back and stood at the foot of the bed . Rock stood at his mother 's head , opposite the priest , now in robe and cap , the open book in one hand , the cross in the other . " Araxi Vagramian , " the priest began softly , then went on in classic Armenian , a language Rock only half-understood , the written language , as it was called , the language of the church . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital . The doctor was there then . " I do n't know , Rock , " he said . " I ca n't say . I wo n't say . " The next day Sark telephoned Rock early in the morning to tell him that Vava was sick and Dr. Lowell was coming to see her . He went over and saw his sister come downstairs in a robe . She was pale and stunned , and seemed to be shivering . She went to him and he embraced her . " Rock , " she said . " Something terrible happened in my sleep . I woke up and hollered , No . No . ' I had to . Poor Sark . My poor kids . I scared them all . " " Mama 's going to get better , " Sark said . " You wait and see . " " Oh , Sark , " his sister said . " For God 's sake , Sark . " " Mama 's a strong woman , " Rock 's brother-in-law said.  | " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She 'll be home in a week , bawling everybody out , especially Rock . " " You do n't know what 's happened to Mama , " Vava said . " I do n't care what 's happened , " Sark said . " I do n't care what the doctor says . I do n't care what anybody says . Mama 's going to get better , that 's all . " The doctor came and told Rock and Sark what it was . Rockunderstood what it was . It was supposed to be oxygen now , dextrose and water through the veins , but he knew . When the doctor had gone Sark said , " See , Rock ? Thisoxygen and all that other stuff means Mama 's getting better . " Rock got in his car with Joe and drove back to the hospital . The hours , the days , and the nights went by one by one . The rubber tube from the oxygen tank was taped to hismother 's face , the end of it into a nostril . Her veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dextrose into her burning body . Members of the family came from Fresno to San Francisco one by one to visit Vava , to speak to Rock , to eat and drink , the ones who had been young when Rock had last seen them now grown to manhood or womanhood , the old gone along to new illnesses , their faces and eyes older now and more confused , their voices loving and lonely . He went out in his car with his cousins , his nephews , and his uncles to saloons , to stand and drink , to talk , to wait . He had watched his mother 's face travel from pity and beauty to desperateviolence . Her breathing became filled with noises . Her eyes fell half-open , and his sister believed her mother could still see and hear . He heard her speak to her mother . " Mama ? It 's Vava . I did n't bake the bread , because only you can bake the bread . It 's waiting there for you . I know you can hear me ,  |p249Mama  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what a terrible thing 's happened to you , Mama , all these things they 're doing to you , a proud woman like you . It 's Vava , Mama . I 'm waiting for you to come home , so I can come and visit you every morning again . " He saw the color of her skin change from the color of life to the color of death . He listened to her breathing , and wanted to know why a man had to be nonsense all his life , asking death not to be death , asking the ugly not to be ugly , asking pain not to be pain , asking the end not to be the end , asking the alone not to be alone . And he went out two or three times a day and night with the men of his family , his anger suddenly flaring up at them because they had deteriorated or had grown to manhood nonsensically , because there was nothing he could do to help the poor woman go . Nothing he could do about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she died he stood over the violence she had become . He was alone in the room at two o'clock in the morning . He took her burning hands and held them tightly at first , then tenderly , kissed them , and then her tortured face , each cheek , as her half-open eyes stared at nothing . He spoke in Armenian to her . " Mother , " he said in Armenian . " Araxi . Try no more . " An hour later he spoke to her again , saying only one word again and again : " Rest . " Saying it slowly , softly , gently . He was there the next day at noon when she stopped at last , nine days after death had come to her . He left the room so that the nurse and the intern could go to work on another corpse . He drove to Vava 's , and when she saw him she knew . She ran to him , trying not to sob , and he said , " Before we take her to Ararat I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , Rock , " his sister said . " Only Mama can bake that bread . Throw it away . Bury it . That 's Mama 's bread . " He put the white porcelain tubful of dough on the table in the storage area off the garage . He dug his fingers through the surface that was now dry and brittle to the gummy moist dough underneath . He pulled out a handful of the stuff , rolled it into a ball , put some wax paper around it , and put it into his coat pocket . They put her in Ararat beside her son Haig , her husband Vahan on the other side of Haig , and then Rock went alone to the house on Winery Street which had been sold to a family named Clayburn . He asked if they wanted to sell it . " Well , " the man said , " we had n't thought of it because it 's a good house , old but solid and good . We 'd sell it if we got a good offer . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The man showed Rock the house Rock was born in . " We paid three thousand dollars for the place three years ago , " the man said , " but real estate 's gone up since then . " " How much do you want for it ? " Rock said . " Oh , five , six thousand , I guess , " the man said . " That 's fair , the way real estate 's shot up . " " Let me think about it , " Rock said . " Five , at least , " the man said . " It 's a good house . Solid , not like the houses they 're building these days . It 's got a good fifteen , twenty years to go . Maybe more . I 'd have to have five , at least . " He went out to the sidewalk for another look at the house , then got in his car and drove back to Ararat . He wandered around there , looking at the tombstones , reading them , savingfor the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned boy 's grave , and remembered Dickp251Cracker trying with the rest of them to swim across the San Joaquin River at Skaggs Bridge and not being able to make it , turning to the others and saying , " I ca n't make it , boys . So long . " That was a long time ago . That was thirty years ago now . He read the tombstone . Dikran Kirakjian 1909  --  1919Drowned in the San Joaquin River September 7 , 1919Body Not RecoveredGoodbye , CrackerPapa &; MamaHe looked at the stones on either side of the boy , the stones of Papa and Mama , all of the stones standing in dry weeds . " Well , " Rock said to the boy 's monument , " they 'll never know what a great man you were , will they , Cracker ? " He wandered away , wandering as he had wandered twenty-five years ago with Murphy , glancing at one stone , stopping to read another , to look at the Armenian print on some of them , not a word or letter in English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One stone had an arm with a clenched fist held high from jagged rock . Who was he ? Murphy said , " This is the only city , Rock . This is the capital of the world . This is where Christians and Jews and Moslems and all the others say to each other , Make way for a pal . ' This is where we 've got to go , boy , but I still say a hole in the ground is a hell of a place for a soul . Let 's go see your brother . " " It 's over here , " Rock said . Haig 's grave was alone then in the family plot , but only ap252year later the soul of the father was put in the hole in the ground beside the soul of the son , and now the soul of the boy 's mother had been put beside him there . When Rock came back to the fresh grave , it was covered with flowers . He brought the ball of dough out of his pocket , broke off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swallowed it . The rest he buried in the fresh dirt . " Goodbye , old girl , " he said . He turned to go , and saw his sister Vava hurrying to the grave , her son Joe walking slowly behind her , saying , " Now , Ma ! Ah , Ma ! " His sister flung herself on the flowers , sobbing , and the boy said to Rock , " She made me drive her back , Rock . She did n't let anybody know , and she made me keep quiet about it . Everybody 's looking for you . They 're all drinking and eating and talking and asking for you . " " We 'll go back in a minute , " Rock said . " Ma 's taking it bad , " Joe said . " I do n't know what to do . " " We 'll wait a minute , " Rock said . " What did you come back for ? " Joe said . " You 've got to bury your mother yourself , alone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , the church has got to bury her , and then you 've got to bury her yourself , alone , because she 's not the same to you that she is to the family . You 've got to bury her alone where they put the body , and you 've got to bury her alone everywhere else she ever was . It takes time . It takes the rest of your life . " " I want to go young , " Joe said . " You do ? " Rock said . " I want to go quick , " Joe said . " I ca n't wait to get in the new war . I do n't want to hang around . " " How old are you now ? " Rock said.  | " Nineteen . " " How many girls you got ? " " One steady , " Joe said . " Six or seven part-time . I do n't know . Ma 's having a rough time . Living stinks , does n't it , Rock ? " " Yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , though . Every one of us loves it . " " I do n't , " Joe said . " I hate it . Always have . Always will . I have a little fun with the girls , that 's all . What 's the use kidding ? It stinks . " " How much do you weigh ? " Rock said . " Two hundred and forty , " Joe said . " How tall are you ? " Rock said . " Six feet two ? " " Three , " Joe said . " Get your weight down to two hundred , " Rock said . " Take it easy . You 're having a hell of a time . " " It 's not fat , " Joe said . " It 's all muscle and bone . " " You were n't any two hundred and forty when you played high school football , " Rock said . " That was two years ago , " Joe said . " I 've grown . " " You 've grown fat . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " Rock said . " A man ought to be lean and hard until he 's thirty at least , and he ought to look hot and hungry . You look round and soft . " " I can get twenty pounds off in a month . " " How ? " " Lay off eating and drinking , get to the gym twice a week . " " A man ought to be in shape who wants to get himself killed quick , in the new war , " Rock said . " Ah , you know what I mean , " Joe said.  | " A fellow who knows living stinks ought to be in perfect shape , " Rock said . " I mean , look at Mama , " Joe said . " She worked hard for us kids , to get us grown up healthy and O.K. and all that , and then just when we 're all halfway grown up and not the kind of trouble we used to be , her own mother dies . If that is n't stinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be alive at least twenty more years . I 'm worried about her . I have n't taken my girl out since Grandma went to the hospital . I 've been taking care of Ma . " " Of course you have , " Rock said . " You just take care of her a few days more . She 'll be O.K. " His sister came to them , her eyes dry now , and she said , " Well , Rock , Mama 's gone . " " Yes , Vava , but you 've got your kids , and I 've got mine . " He turned to the boy . " Joe , " he said , " I 'll drive Mama back to the party . " " I 'll say it 's a party , " Joe said . " Is that the way the Armeniansdo it ? " " It 's not a bad way , " Rock said . " I 'll see you there . " He drove back to the party at his uncle Krikor 's house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to drink and eat . One by one the members of the family got up and went home . He saw his sister and her husband and children go off on the two-hundred-mile drive back to San Francisco . " We 'll be home around eleven , " Sark said . " Joe drives fast but he drives good . " " What are you going to do , Rock ? " his sister said . " I 'll drive up soon , " Rock said . " You take care of yourself now , " Vava said . He drove to Fat Aram 's and drank there until the placep255closed , sitting alone . Then he drank with Fat Aram . At four in the morning he got up and had two cups of black coffee . Then he began to drive back to San Francisco , knowing the enormity of a man 's nonsense , knowing it mile after mile , and now , with one more of his girls gone , he felt himself falling into humorlessness , apathy , indifference , fat , and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also nonsense . Every man is afraid and fearless . A man is a game fellow all his life , and never less than half scared to death . There is a good deal within a man by which to be unafraid of anything , and a good deal outside of him by which to have the fear of God thrown into him every instant . Outside is a woman who was for many years his wife . Outside is his son . Outside is his daughter . Outside is taxes . Outside is debts . Inside is only the wink . ONE day Ann telephoned and said , " What are you doing ? " " What do you want ? " Rock said . " Money , " Ann said . " I owe rent for two months . The bills are piling up . I 've got to have money . " " I have n't any , " Rock said . " You 've got to get some , " Ann said . " You 're home , " Rock said . " Borrow some from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I ca n't , " Ann said . " They wo n't lend me any . " " Why not ? " " They do n't want to pay for the upbringing of your kids . " " Send the kids out here , " Rock said . " I 'll never give up my kids , " Ann said . " Well , " Rock said , " I have n't any money and if your familyp256wo n't help , I do n't know what you 're going to do . I could sell the car , but it 's eight years old and I could n't get very much for it . It 's falling to pieces , too , but I 'm fond of it . I 'll sell it if you want me to , though . " " I 've got to have money , that 's all , " Ann said . " You need too much money for a girl who has n't got a dime of her own and ca n't get more than the equivalent of a tip from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll sell the car and send you the money . " " If you have n't got any money , what are you living on ? " Ann said . " I do n't need much , " Rock said . " I 've got everything I need . " " What about all those San Francisco society girls you 're entertaining all the time ? " Ann said . " It 's in all the columns in New York . You 've got to pay money to entertain them , do n't you ? " " I do n't know any society girls , except you , " Rock said . " You were a society girl , were n't you ? Cafe society or something like that ? Or was it high society ? " " High , " Ann said . " The highest , from Second Avenue to Park Avenue in one jump . What are you doing , Rock ? " " I 'm learning to read Armenian , " Rock said . " The priest who buried my mother is helping me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Armenian papers ? " " Yes . " " What else ? " " I 'm trying to write in Armenian . " " Why do n't you try to write in Turkish ? " Ann said . " I do n't like the mother of my kids to be a smart aleckp257about Armenians and Turks , " Rock said . " They 're people who are pathetic enough without any help from anybody else . " " What 's the matter with you , Rock ? " Ann said . " Do n't you enjoy my jokes any more ? You used to . " " I 'm tired of jokes , " Rock said . " You made me very tired of jokes , even good ones , Ann . You made a joke of my son and my daughter , and the others that were to have been born . You made a joke of love and marriage , of yourself and myself . I guess I 've laughed as much as I 'm ever going to about the joke you made of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got any money , Ann . I 've got taxes to pay for two years , and a lot of debts . I 'll sell the car and send you the money , though . Is there anything else ? " " Well , yes , there is , " Ann said . " The money from the car wo n't be enough . You agreed to send a thousand dollars a month . A thousand is n't enough , but I agreed to it . I 'm trying to give the children a nice home and a good life . It would be monstrous if you did n't send money for the support of your children . " " I do n't have any money , Ann . " " You could sell the house , could n't you ? " Ann said . " I thought I 'd keep the house , " Rock said . " I built it for my mother . I do n't like the idea of selling it . Besides , I would n't have anywhere to go . It 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to have money , " Ann said . " Where you get it or how you get it is your problem . " " When I talked to your lawyer just before I left New York a month ago I had three thousand dollars , " Rock said . " I planned to go to work , but I had to spend the money , and the work I was going to do fell through . The production of the play was abandoned . "  | " You could get work if you wanted to . " " On a vineyard or tending bar maybe . " " You know very well you could get work that pays big money if you wanted to , " Ann said . " Is that so ? " Rock said . " Where ? " " At your old studio . U.S. Pictures , " Ann said . " How do you know ? " Rock said . " Oh , I just happened to find out , " Ann said . " I have friends in Hollywood . I happen to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to know the kind it was ? " Rock said . " Well , it 's not the best , but so what ? " Ann said . " Who are you ? Are you too good to take a test again ? After all , you 've been a bum for eight years . He 's got a right to find out if you 're worth anything , has n't he ? " " Is there anything else ? " Rock said . " I have to pay for thiscall , and I do n't want them to take the phone out . " " I happen to know he 'll give you a contract for a year atfive hundred a week , " Ann said . " I could use that money . " " I 'll sell the car , Ann , and send you the money , " Rock said . " Are n't you going to ask about the children ? " Ann said . " Is somebody there who knows something about them ? " Rock said . " I know all about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they adore me . Sell the car and send me the money , though , if you do n't want to talk about your own children . " " How are they ? " Rock said . " A lot you care , " Ann said . " How 's Haig ? How 's Lula ? " " If you cared for your children you 'd send them money . "  | " I 'd like to talk to them , Ann , if I may , please . " " They 're asleep and I 'm not going to wake them up . Good-bye . " He hung up , got in his car , and drove to the ocean . He went out to the edge of the water and stood there a half hour , listening to the sea , then drove home , trying to drive out of himself the fear of God that had been thrown into him about his children by their mother . He drove to town the next day to sell his car , but before trying to do so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Yanks to beat the Red Sox , and they did . They did it in the bottom of the ninth , but they did it . His friend , the bettingcommissioner , counted out eight hundred and twenty dollars in currency , so Rock had at least a little money to send her , and he still had the car , too . He filled the car with groceries , enough for a month or two , kept a few dollars for himself , and sent Ann $750 , asking her to please have the nurse drop him a word or two about the children every couple of weeks . There was no word from the nurse , though , or from Ann , and then one night she telephoned again , reversing the charges , as she always did . " What are you doing ? " she said . " I thought perhaps the nurse would write and tell me about the children , " Rock said . " I thought you 'd tell me about the eviction . All I know is what I saw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I telephoned the lawyers and told them I owe them the rent money all right . I told them I 'd pay them as soon as I get some money . It 's three thousand , includingcourt costs . I 'm sorry that happened . I thought your parents would help you . I did n't think they 'd let somebodyp260else help you . Somebody must be helping you . I thought you 'd answer my letters and tell me about it . " " What else ? " Ann said . " Well , I even thought you might want to tell me --  " " Tell you what , Rock ? " " Well , " he said , " I thought you might want to tell me you 're sorry for making a joke of so many things , and then maybe --  " He stopped again suddenly , for he was sick of the joke , and never felt the sickness so much as when he spoke to her , even by telephone , even with three thousand miles between them . " Listen , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What do you want , Ann ? " " I want money , Rock . " " I have n't got any . " " You could gamble again , " she said . " That betting commissionerowes you plenty . Gambling owes you plenty . " " I do n't like to gamble , " Rock said . " I have n't any money to cover a loss with . I took a chance last time because I hated the idea of losing my car . They wo n't give me more than eight or nine hundred dollars for it , anyway . " " I happen to know Schwartz 's offer still goes , " Ann said . " All you 've got to do is get in your car and drive down there and let them shoot a test in a couple of hours , and then go to work a year at five hundred dollars a week . That 's twentysixthousand dollars a year . I can use that money . I happen to know he 's pretty sure he 's going to like the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm broke , and is trying to take advantage of that , " Rock said . " I have his telegrams and letters . " " Well , what are you doing about it ? " Ann said . " Reading the Armenian papers ? "  | " I told you I do n't like the mother of my kids to be a smart aleck about their family , " Rock said . " They 're also my kids . They 're not yours alone . " " All right , Rock , " Ann said . " I just think it would be monstrousif you did n't send money for the upbringing of your children . " " Is there anything else , Ann ? " " No . I just need money . " " Is there anything you want to tell me about yourself ? " he said . " What you 're doing ? What your plans are ? Why you keep using the word monstrous all the time ? What you 're thinking of for the future , for yourself and for the kids ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of your business . " " Well , goodbye , Ann . " " What about the money ? " " I have n't got any . If I get some I 'll send it . All of it . " " What are you doing about getting some ? " Ann said . " Well , I wo n't say that that 's none of your business , " Rock said . " I do n't like Schwartz 's offer . I do n't have any other . I 've spoken to a number of good agents in New York and Hollywood . They have n't come up with anything yet . Goodbye , Ann . " He went to the betting commissioner 's a month later when he was broke again and took a flyer on a two-team parley , and won . The betting commissioner counted out eighteen hundred dollars , knowing Rock was broke ( since Rock had told him so ) , and even though he had n't had any word from Ann about the children he sent her fifteen hundred dollars . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked if she would please think about having the nurse bringp262the children out to San Francisco to spend a month with him . She did not answer his letter , but a month later telephoned again . " What are you doing ? " she said . " What do you want , Ann ? " " I want money , Rock . " " Is there anything you want to tell me about anything ? " Rock said . " About what , Rock ? " " Anything , " Rock said . " Anything you think I might be interested in . " " I ca n't think of anything , " Ann said . " I 'll send you some money as soon as I get some , " Rock said . " Goodbye , Ann . " " Is there anything you want to tell me about anything ? " Ann said quickly . " Why do n't we put it that way , Rock ? " " The kids are n't with me , " Rock said . " There is n't much for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother telephoned a couple of weeks ago and said that if I would go back to work and make some money you and the children would come back to me . " " What did you tell her ? " Ann said . " I told her you ought to marry a man with a lot of money , " Rock said . " You mean if you could afford it , you would n't want me back ? " Ann said . " No , Ann . " " Why not ? " " I can afford it now , " Rock said . " You have n't got a dime , " Ann said.  | " No , but I can afford it , " Rock said . " If I had a job and a lot of money put away and a steady income , I could n't afford it . I do n't need a lot to live on , and kids do n't , either , except love . An imitation of love is purchasable only from whores , Ann . Good men sometimes need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the mothers of children . Goodbye , Ann . " One day in September David Key came to the house in San Francisco and said , " Schwartz sent me , Rock , but I came for reasons of my own , too . " " What are they ? " Rock said . " Well , I know you 've been having a rough time , " David said . " I mean , everybody knows . Well , I thought maybe I could --  " " You could ' what , David ? " " Well , I think you know what I mean , " David said . " I 'm pretty sure you do n't like the idea , so maybe I 'd better skip it . " " Yes , " Rock said , " but I want you to know I think it 's kind of you . What 's Schwartz up to ? " " Well , you know how he ca n't do anything except in imitation of my father , " David said . " He 's got his heart set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His offer 's a poor one , " Rock said . " It is , " David said , " but things have changed in Hollywood , Rock . The test is nothing . He 's just doing that to look im-portant . " " I do n't mind the test , " Rock said . " I do n't mind his being important , either . Maybe he is important , David . He does n't offer enough money , that 's all . I 'm supposed to send a thousand a month to my kids and their mother . I 've got to payp264taxes on that money . I 've got two years back taxes to pay , and around sixty thousand in debts . A year at five hundred dollars a week would n't do me much good . I 've got an agent hustling around in Hollywood , and another in New York . " " The public 's forgotten you , Rock , " David said . " They 've forgotten so many others , too . It 's not the worst offer in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year that you work , when the year 's over you can make a much better deal . The idea of limiting the contract to one year was n't Schwartz 's idea , Rock . It was mine . I told him you might not turn out the way you did the first time . I told him that because I know you 'll be better than ever , and you wo n't have a bad long-term contract to keep you from getting your debts paid . I hope you do n't mind , Rock . " " I do n't mind , " Rock said , " but a year 's a long time to spend in Hollywood at five hundred dollars a week , more than half of which has to go to New York . Tell Schwartz to make it a thousand a week , and I 'll drive down and take the test . If he does n't like the test , nobody 's lost anything . I want to work again all right , but I ca n't get into something that 's only going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly back and tell him , " David said , " but I do n't think he 'll take you up , Rock . He 's sure you 're going to accept his offer sooner or later . He happens to know your agent has n't had any luck with any of the other studios . I 'll tell him , though , Rock . I 'll try to get him to -- - " " No , " Rock said , " do n't try anything . Just tell him what I told you . I do n't like things to get too much help . You do n't seem as troubled as you were when we talked in New York . I hope things are working out all right . " " Sam says I 'll be producing soon , " David said . " I know thatp265only means he 'll still be producing . But I 'll get my name up as the producer , anyway , and more money . They 'll be the same pictures , though . " " They 're not bad pictures , " Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David said . " The picturesare bad all right . I 've seen all of my father 's pictures again . I made a point of seeing every one of them again after our talk in New York . I saw them in order , one a day , and I thought about each of them , forty-five pictures . They 're very bad , Rock . There 's something in every one of them that is very bad . It 's in the fourteen pictures you were in , too , Rock . " " Was I in that many ? " Rock said . " Yes , " David said , " and every one of them 's bad . I 've thought about it a lot , and I think I know what 's the matter . " " What is it ? " Rock said . " We 're liars , Rock , and do n't need to be , " David said . " Do n't need to be at all . Every place in every picture that is false could just as easily have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my father at first , but I 'm not any more . " I wonder if you know about the play he wrote ? " Rock said . " Yes , " David said . " Myra Clewes told me the day after we talked in New York . I meant to write you about it , but I did n't know what to say . I found all of his writing . It 's all bad , worse than the movies , except that one , and that 's not very good , either , Rock . " " No ? " Rock said . " The play itself is almost something , " David said , " but it is n't my father , and the reason it is n't is very simple . He 'd al/ready changed his name from Keesler to Key . That 's O.K. But you ca n't change Paul Key to Patrick Kerry , too , and expectwhat you do to be O.K. You ca n't hide , and expect anything to be O.K. I did n't think my father was that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he became such a man . " " Ca n't you , actually ? " Rock said . " No , I ca n't , Rock , " David said , " and I know what you 're thinking . No man has a right to fool with something that goes out to people who is not himself true , who is not proudly himself . If he is justified in not being proud of himself , then he has got to live in such a way that will compel him to be proud of himself , even if he sells neckties out of a satchel on a street corner . He has no right to hide from himself and from the world that he is not proud of himself , and that 's what my father did . He was unhappy about being a Jew , about being Paul Keesler , about being himself . Why ? Who the hell else did he expect to be ? Who the hell is the man who is happy about who he is ? Is he somebody better than my father ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it you 're going to do about it ? " " Well , Rock , " David said . He went to the door , opened it , then stopped and turned . " I guess I 'm going to work as well as I know how to put across the superiority of truth to anything else : convenience , effectiveness , expediency , profit . Schwartz sent me about his offer , but I came for reasons of my own , too , one of which was to tell you these things . I love my father more than ever . I 'm not sorry , though , that I do n't admire him so much any more . I think he could have been almost a great man , perhaps even a great writer . Well , I 'll tell Schwartz what you told me to tell him , Rock . " Every man is afraid and fearless . He is fearless about hisp267father turning out to be his son , but fearful about his son living long enough to turn out to be his father . Every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mother , sister and brother , or the brothers and sisters of his father and mother , and their children . He needs his children , or the people who are supposed to be of his own nationality , the Americans , for instance , or the people of that part of the world in which he was born and spent his boyhood and early manhood , the people of California , for instance , or people like himself in other things , in things of the spirit and mind , in humor or velocity , for instance . A man needs his family , whoever or whatever his family is . He needs them whether he loves or hates them . He may not need a great deal of them , but he needs a little of them , he needs at least a moment of them now and then , he needs to have another look at them , he needs to be among them again , he needs to be astonished by them . Why not ? Is n't it a fine thing to see them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an amazing thing to see so many of them still alive , still working hard , still trying to make both ends meet , as they put it , still trying to keep body and soul together , as they say , still askingtenderly if old acquaintance should be forgot , still standingaround and talking things over ? Why should n't a man have another look at his family ? Is n't it better than looking at print in books all the time ? Is n't it better than nothing ? Is n't it a little something or other to get out among one 's own family and holler to them and see their terrible faces ? ONE morning he telephoned Zadik . " Zadik , " he said , " I would like you to come to the housep268some evening for some food and drink and talk . Could you make it tonight ? " " I will come gladly , by streetcar , Rock , " the priest said . " At what hour ? " " I 'll come and get you at the church at seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They had Scotch before dinner , which was broiled steaks , and brandy after dinner . Rock brought out the sheet of lined paper he had kept for twenty-five years . " Will you read this handwriting to me , please ? " he said . " Very good , " Zadik said . " I will if I can . Let me put on my glasses . " The dark little man with the black beard , happy and halfdrunk , put on his glasses and studied the handwriting a moment , then began to read . When he had read the entire poem aloud he looked at Rock and said , " What is this , Rock ? " " I want you to tell vie , " Rock said . " Do you understand this poem ? " Zadik said . " Not altogether , " Rock said . " What does it say ? " " It says several strange things , " Zadik said . " Who is the writer ?

" " It says several things at once in the words , " Zadik said , " and at the same time it says several other things at once , but not in words . " " Yes , " Rock said . " Well , let 's have another drink , please take all the time you need , and tell me each of the things it says in words , and each that it says without words . "  | " It says things we all say in our hearts , now and then , perhapsonce in a lifetime , to somebody we love , or somebody we hate , or somebody we love at whom we are very angry , " Zadik said . " Yes , " Rock said . " Now , here 's this drink . Drink , and then drink more . What does the writer of the poem say ? What does he say ? " Zadik swallowed his drink and said , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . He says he speaks to God with pity but without love . He says he loves not God but man , and especially the enemy , the Turk . The Turk , Rock , in his own father , in himself , and in his own son . He says he must pity God because God is the Father , and His children love Him like fools or hate Him like fools or mock Him like fools . He says he has breathed a long time , from beneath the mulberry tree on the hillside of Baghesht  --  which is the ancient name of Bitlis  --  halfway across the world , to the fig tree in the garden of The Asbarez , just beyond the Armenian printing presses of Fresno . " Zadik stopped . Rock filled Zadik 's glass with brandy , and his own as well . They swallowed their drinks , and the priest said , " He says , Rock , that he has a son , no better than any Turk 's son , but a man in whom his own heart beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Father . He says if he is to live he is to live in this son , for the other one , the better one , died as a child . If he is to go on breathing , he says , this son must restore to him the breath of life . If he is awakened from the sleep of death by this son , he will live and he will love . If he is not awakened , he will never know that he was never awakened , he will not remember that he breathed the mulberry-scented air of Baghesht once , he willp270neither know nor care that he hated the Turk until the last moment when he loved him more deeply than he loved the sons of Haig themselves , he will not remember his father , himself , or his sons . If he is not awakened by this son , he will never know the gladness with which he stopped breathing , stopped loving , and stopped hating . " The priest looked from the sheet of paper to Rock , and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Rock said . " What do you want to tell me about this poem , Rock ? " Zadik said . " My father wrote those lines the day I came home and found him dead at the kitchen table , " Rock said . " He had closed the doors and shut the windows , and he had opened the gas of the stove . " " Could you not have reached home a little earlier , Rock ? " " No . " " Had you reached home perhaps only a half hour earlier you would have given him the breath he wanted . " " I reached home when I did , " Rock said . " Where were you ? " Zadik said . " What 's the difference where I was ? " Rock said . " Where was he ? " " It is not said in the words , " Zadik said , " but it is deeply felt that he believed you would awaken him . " " He was dead , " Rock said . " He had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " Did you stop somewhere on the way home ? " Zadik said . " Perhaps to visit a friend ? " " I had just driven Murphy back from Bakersfield , " Rock said . " I put the car in the garage and started walking home ,  |p271walking  down Eye to Ventura . I ran into a friend talking to a couple of girls . I stood and talked with them a half hour , and then I walked home . " " Was it necessary to stand and talk with them ? " Zadik said . " Yes , " Rock said . " Yes , it was . It was certainly as necessary as it was for my father to do what he did . I do n't say it was n't necessary for him to do what he did . Why should anybody feel it was n't necessary for me to do what I did ? " " A pity , Rock , " the priest said . " A pitiful accident . " " What he did was no accident , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father , Rock , " the priest said . " My son means a great deal to me , " Rock said , " but alreadyhe 's lost to me , a stranger in a strange city , his own mother , whom he loves , a stranger to me . I 'm not going to kill myself about that , Zadik . " " Of course not , Rock . " " I 'm not going to kill myself about anything , " Rock said , " or anybody , and I 'll tell you why . I want my son to know that his father is somewhere in the world , demanding nothing of his son , offering nothing to him , so that if ever his son wishes to speak to a friend , his father will be there to speak to . I am not angry at my father for what he did . I am not sorry I stopped on my way home to talk to my friends . I do not pity the Father . I love Him , because my son will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five years to learn what my father wrote before he died . I waited until my mother was dead , so that I could go on pretending that he had died of a heart attack , as our family doctor and I agreed to pretend . " " It is a great poem , Rock , " the priest said . " No , " Rock said . " He did not live long enough to write a great poem . "  | " He lived a long time , Rock , " Zadik said . " It takes a long time to write a poem like that . " " It takes a longer time to live a life , " Rock said . " At the end of that time the going is not easy , it is not at the table of your own house on a summer 's day . It is not ended in an hour of dreaming . The breathing does n't stop in one hour . The departureis in a terrible room , in a fearful bed , in which hundreds of others have suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , it does n't even begin to stop for days and nights of feverish , frightful sleep , sleep involving hundreds of thousands of dreams and details , from which there is no awakening . The arrival of the son on time can not stay the going , can not make it easy : the arrival in time to give the news of wife and children , to receive the instructions of life and manners , can not stay the going , can not restore the traveler to health and borne , to the kitchen , to the stove , to the bread to be baked . I came home on a happy summer 's day and saw my father dead . I came home again on a winter 's day and saw my mother alive . I saw her for nine days and nights , alive every moment , but dying . I saw her die . I saw a life end . There 's no poetry in it . It 's ugly . There is nothing uglier than a life dying . It has no beauty at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no art in it . I adore women , all of them , good and bad , for their rejection of art in favor of life , for their beauty , for their patience , for their wisdom . Will you read the whole thing again , please ? " The priest read the poem again , slower this time , with better timing , and when he was finished Rock said , " Well , at any rate , you forgot to mention that he does speak with love of his wife . I did n't notice that the first time , either . " " It is altogether a poem of love , Rock , " the priest said.  | " May I borrow it ? I would like to write it out and read it from time to time . " " Why ? " Rock said . " Rock , " the priest said , " I am one who must not hate , each of us is such a one , yet I hate . I hate the Turk . " " Hate him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No , Rock , it is no good , " the priest said . " It is no good to hate . " " Hate the Turk a little , " Rock said . " You were born in the old country . Let it go . Hate him . Do n't worry about it . " " It is no good to hate , Rock , " Zadik said . " It is bad for the soul . " " Let a little of the soul be bad , " Rock said . " Hate the Turk a little . Give him the happiness of your hatred . Let him always feel that A enians born six thousand miles away from Armeniahate him . Let him always feel that Armenians who cannotspeak a word of Armenian hate him . Let him feel that Armenians whose mothers or fathers are Russian or French or Italian or Scotch or Irish hate him . Let the Turk heal himself in the hatred of the Armenian . " " You will let me keep this a few days ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had thought I would translate it into English , but I do not want to do that now . " " Could you not have gotten home perhaps a half hour earlier , Rock ? " the priest said . " Zadik , you 're drunk , " Rock said . " My father has been dead twenty-five years . If he was dead twenty-five seconds when I got home it was forever . Take good care of the poem . I 'll drive you home . " They went out , after last drinks , loitered along the walk to the gate , stood a moment on the small patch of lawn , then :  |p274ste|p|ped  to the car , speaking of hate and love , fathers and sons . They got into the car and began to drive to the church , the driver of the car saying to his friend , the member of his family , " A man needs his family . He needs the Turk of his family , to hate , to think he hates , to love , to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hates and loves . I have seen only half a dozen Turks in my whole lifetime . They are members of the family , Zadik . They are entitled to a little decent hatred . " No man knows what a man is , but every man tries to guess . No man knows what a woman is , but no man tires of getting near enough to one more of them to try again to find out . A man is a lone thing and a woman is a lone thing , except when she is with child . Even a man and a woman together are a lone thing , a new lone thing , their togetherness a lone thing . Men and women are lone things needing one another , and needing men and women come out of their need . Having come from women , men must return to women . They must return again and again . Having been made unalone by men , having become with children by them , women must return to men , they must return again and again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to father , to son . There is no other way for man , which is **55;5766;TOOLONG to live , to love , to give life , and finally to give it up . There is no other way to love God , truth , art , beauty , science , money , roses , clothes , automobiles , houses , soap , or Saturday nights . ONE day in December Ann telephoned again . " What are you doing ? " she said . " How are you , Ann ? " Rock said . " How are the children ?  |p275THE  SON AND THE DAUGHTERIs it snowing in New York ? Are you having fun ? I hope you 're well . Put Haig on the phone . I want to hear Haig 's voice . " " What 's happened to you , Rock ? " Ann said . " Put Lula on the phone , Ann , " Rock said . " I want to hear Lula 's voice . " " Have you made a lot of money ? " Ann said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " " No , Ann , " Rock said . " I have n't made a lot of money , but I 've still got my car . " " Have you still got your debts ? " Ann said . " Yes , " Rock said , " I 've still got my debts , too , Ann . Let me speak to Haig , will you , Ann ? " " He 's asleep , Rock . " " Wake Haig up for me , Ann . He 'll understand . " " I need money , Rock . " " I know you do , Ann . Wake Lula up . Put her on the phone . I want to hear Lula 's voice . " " You 've got to send me money , Rock . " " I know I do , Ann . Let me speak to Haig , please . " " Hold on a minute . " He waited a moment and then began to hear their voices as they came to the phone . He heard Ann say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is it Papa ? " he heard the boy say .. " Where is Papa ? " " He 's in San Francisco , " he heard Ann say . " San Francisco ? " he heard the boy say , laughing . " I was in San Francisco . That 's not so far away . " The boy got on the phone . " Papa ? " he said . " Yes , Haig , " Rock said.
