Sister Confessors From a chauffeured yellow Cadillac convertible in front of the San Francisco Chronicle building last winter stepped a shapely brunette wearing a little black dress by Dior and the scrutable smile of a woman who knows what she wants . Ushered into Sunday Editor Stanleigh Arnold 's third-floor office . Mrs. Morton ( " Popo " ) Phillips announced that the paper 's advice-to-the-lovelorn column had gone from drab to worse . " Why . " she protested prettily , " I know I could do better myself . " Editor Arnold suggested that she try , handed his visitor a six-week sheaf of columns by Lovelornist Molly Mayfield . <P> In less than two hours , Popo Phillips was back with her own replies to more than 70 lonelyheart letters . Their crisply confident style so impressed the editors that she returned the same afternoon to sign a contract to write six columns a week for the Chronicle under the pen name Abigail Van Buren. also landed a ten-year contract with the McNaught Syndicate . As she was leaving the Chronicle , Editor Arnold remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters reminded him of Ann ( Your Problems ) Landers , heartthrob star of the Chicago Sun-Times Syndicate . " They ought to , " rejoined Popo . " She 's my twin sister . " <P> Deliberate Satire ? Last week as Popo , 38 , celebrated her first birthday as Abby Van Buren , she was the fastest rising lonelyheart columnist in the U.S. So quickly has her Dear Abby column caught on that it now appears in some 80 U.S. newspapers , from New York 's garter-snapping Daily Mirror ( circ. 842,023 ) to the sobersided Portland Oregonian ( 181,910 ) , only a dozen fewer syndicate clients than carry sister Ann Landers , whose real name is Mrs. Jules ( " Eppie " ) Lederer . This makes Abby the fourth-ranking U.S. lovelornist , after Dorothy Dix , Mary Haworth and Ann Landers . <P> Abby 's swift climb is the more remarkable because her column often reads like a parody of other lovelornists . In fact , San Franciscans at first thought that Abby even concocted her own letters as a deliberate takeoff . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from a girl who confessed : " My boy friend took me out on my 21st birthday and wanted to show me a very special good time . I usually do n't go in much for drinking , but I had three martinis . During dinner we split a bottle of wine . After dinner we had two brandies . Did I do wrong ? " Quipped Abby : " Probably . " <P> <P> Last week Dear Abby related the plight of a woman who complained : " My problem is my husband . He wears false teeth - uppers and lowers-and he thinks it is real funny to take them out at parties and do a Spanish dance , using them as castanets . Should I keep him away from parties or should I just tell him he is n't funny ? " Advised Abby : " Let him have a good time . I think it is hysterical . "
