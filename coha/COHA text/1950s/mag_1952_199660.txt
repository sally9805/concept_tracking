In Boston , delegates to the 57th triennial convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church found the early days of their two-week session dominated by a delicate problem : Should women be allowed to sit as delegates in the church 's House of Deputies ? A commission assigned to study the matter said yes . Among other things , the commission noted that the Church of England has admitted women as lay delegates for many years . But the motion ran into trouble . <P> Most clerical delegates favored admitting the women , but most lay delegates were stoutly against it . Said one layman : " There is a physical and psychological difference between men &; women . Men can fight things out in perfectly dispassionate fashion . You can say to a man ' I thoroughly disagree with your judgment . ' But you disagree with a woman 's judgment and you disagree with the woman . " To the dis- tress of the women and their clerical allies , the objectors won . Commented the Rev. Leland Stark of Washington , B.C. : " Every argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said Mrs. <P> Theodore Wedel , wife of the new president of the House of Deputies : " We Episcopalians will grow up eventually . " At other meetings throughout the week , the delegates : Heard an opening sermon in Boston 's Old North Church by the world 's No. 1 Anglican , Dr. Geoffrey Francis Fisher , Archbishop of Canterbury . Warned Dr. Fisher , making a rare appearance on television : * " The essentially Christian virtues of moderation and toleration are assailed by extremisms and fanaticism all over the world , by doctrines of ' apartheid , ' by demands that ' what we want is therefore our right , and we must have it ... without regard to the interests of others . ' " Voted for an intensive missionary campaign in the " vital strategic area " of the missionary district of Alaska , " in the belief that Christianity forms the first line of defense . " <P> Heard a report that the total number of Episcopal clergy had increased by 600 since 1949- " the first notable increase in many years . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archbishop had a few words to say about TV . " The world , " he noted , " would have been a happier place if television had never been discovered . . . Television is part of the uneasiness of life ... a mass-produced form of education which is potentially one of the greatest dangers in the world . " He admitted , however , that Mrs. Fisher has become a baseball fan by watching ball games on television .
