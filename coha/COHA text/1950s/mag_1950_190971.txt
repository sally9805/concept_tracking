Muscovites may have been slightly surprised last week to see Marshal Semen Budenny canter across the cobbles of Red Square on a chestnut stallion . He took the place of honor on the 33rd anniversary celebration of the Bolshevik revolution . <P> Old ( 67 ) Cavalryman Budenny had been a hero of the civil war of 1918-21 , but not much had been seen or heard of him since 1941 when the Nazis plowed through the armies under his command . Why had the Kremlin rulers decided to remove Budenny and his massive mustaches from naphthalene powder ( Russian equivalent of mothballs ) ? Best guess : Budenny symbolized patriotism as distinguished from Communism , and the Kremlin was again whipping up the love of the fatherland which had so heroically stirred Russia in 1941-45 . To the troops in Red Square Budenny roared : <P> " Vigilantly guard the peace , the borders of our country and the creative work of our people against . . . the bandit interventionists in Korea ! " The evening before , in the Bolshoi Theater , a select audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in Korea with the civil war in Russia when the Allies unsuccessfully intervened against the Bolsheviks . Accusing the U.S. of instigating World War III with the aim of destroying the Soviet Union , Bulganin keynoted : " The Soviet people are able to defend . . . their homeland . . . with guns in hand . " <P> To point up the shift in the propaganda line , three top Kremlinites who are known more as Communists than as Russians absented themselves from the ceremonies . The absent : Stalin , Malenkov and Beria.
