With the angry cries of feuding Republicans still echoing from Texas , Bob Taft last week talked of compromise . To avoid a floor fight at the national convention , said Taft , " I 'd like to compromise all delegate contests where there seems to be a difference of legal opinion . . . We 'll give in where our case is weak , if they 'll give in where their case is weak . " But he added that the Eisenhower forces are " trying to make an issue " out of the Texas case . Said he : " I think they 'd rather have the issue than the delegates . " <P> Ike 's campaign manager , Massachusetts ' Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , turned down the Taft offer , issued a smug and cocky statement : " It is never right to compromise with dishonesty . We are in the right , both on the facts and on the law , and will enter into no deals which will disenfranchise the Republicans of Texas . The convention itself will decide the issue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law &; Rule . In Texas , the Eisenhower forces ' case is based on the law and the rules of the Republican Party . Texas law permits political parties to establish their own rules for participation in precinct caucuses . The only qualification set by the pro-Taft Republican organization : the voter had to sign a pledge that " I am a Republican and desire to participate in Republican activities in 1952 . " Voters who carried the precinct caucuses for Ike had signed the statement . <P> Taftmen agree that the pledge was signed , but they contend that many of the signatures were fraudulent . As evidence that the Ike forces openly sought Democratic votes , Taft Campaign Manager David S. Ingalls produced newspaper advertisements in which Eisenhower supporters urged Democrats to sign the pledge and attend Republican caucuses . The ads promised : " You are not pledged to support the nominee of the Republican Party nor does it prohibit you from voting in the July Democratic primary . . . " As a result of this proposition , said Ingalls , Democrats moved into the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention . <P> Evidence &; Principle . In states where political parties are evenly balanced , it is not easy to take seriously the fear that one party will try to control the other . But in states such as Texas , the threat that members of the larger party will grab control of the smaller is always present . It is by no means established that this is , in fact , what happened in Texas . The bulk of the evidence suggests that most Ike voters were acting in good faith , were disgusted with the Fair Deal and saw Ike as the candidate most likely to turn the Democrats out of Washington . <P> This , however , is a question of evidence ( not of principle ) that may be hard to establish , especially before professional politicians , who are inclined to look askance at efforts of " interlopers " to snatch their organizations . Add to that difficulty the fact that Taft forces will probably control the convention 's Credentials Committee , and the Taft position appears a formidable one . Maybe Lodge has enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention floor-and maybe he hasn't.
