Last season a dramatic three-way tie stimulated interest in league play , especially at ambitious NEW MEXICO STATE , where the 1960 schedule includes such ranking powers as San Francisco , Utah , Colorado , and UCLA . Although the Aggies do n't appear to be quite as strong this time , they are overwhelming favorites to win the title . Billy Joe Price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was second in rebounding , returns with Forwards Lee Bowen and Gerald Robison . In the backcourt Coach Presley Askew has only one experienced man , Roy Clymer , to help orient promising sophomore Darrell Bushmiaer . The team 's leading new feature is 6-foot-6 Forward George Knighton ; the only other holdover is Adison Canady . Lack of speed is one handicap the team will simply have to live with . The other is ARIZONA STATE , whose speed , deception and experience ( four veteran starters ) are a perfect fit for Coach Ned Wulk 's fast-breaking multiple-pivot offense . Here , too , is the spectacular 5-foot-10 all-conference guard , Paul Howard , a fine ball handler and floor leader who hit 43% of his 411 field goal attempts , using almost exclusively a 25-foot jump shot . Al Nealey , all-conference second-team forward for two years , led State in rebounding and scoring ; his fellow front linemen , Gary Norton and Bill Pryor , return with him . The fifth starter is likely to be transfer Larry Armstrong . Tom Hughes adds proved depth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payne , Harv Darche and Chico Morrison complete the roster , WEST TEXAS STATE 'S plans to stir up the first division are solidly based on the return of four big starters . The front line will average more than 6 feet 5 , and includes Center Milt Fitts and Forwards Jim Reid and Gene King . Keith Blair is back at guard , where he will team with sophomore Jim Curtsinger . Biggest new man is Center Jim Conner , 6 feet 8 ; other sophomores who will play often are Dave Seal , Henry Hardaway and Jerry Bell . New Coach Metz LaFollette has no veteran reserves but may be able to balance this inexperience with the best height in the conference , fine speed and shooting . TEXAS WESTERN , where basketball has a bigger following than at any other conference school , faces a year of taxing readjustment . Only one returning starter is on campus to greet new Coach Harold Davis , who plans to change the Miners ' traditionally deliberate style of attack to the fast break . Guard Don Burgess will have to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jerry Gilley and Don Vollintine , sophomore Matt Turner and several transfers who are still unknown quantities . ARIZONA 'S three returning starters have hopes of atoning for last year 's worst-ever record . One of the league 's better pivotmen , Ernie McCray , leads Jon Conner , Miles Zeller , Warner Lee and sophomores Kirk Young and Dick Cunningham in the drive to return the Wildcats to their once-familiar perch at the top . HARDIN-SIMMONS Coach Bill Scott will have a small , young , green-as-grass squad , with no height , a little speed , fair shooting and lots of headaches for him . He must build around Joe Arden , Mel Cunningham , Milton Martin and soph Rick Stapleton , and work toward next year . // This area also boasts two basketball-rich Negro colleges which have produced more than their share of pro talent while amassing fine won-lost records . GRAMBLING won 28 of 29 games last year and averaged 95.3 points per game . Charlie Hardnett and Howard ( Jim Dandy ) Willis , both 6 feet 8 , return to see if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Five others who contributed to the squad 's startling .514 shooting average are gone , but last year 's reserves , Rex Tippitt , Roy Johnson , Mike Dinkins and Tracy Hobdy , are ready . Coach Fred Hobdy rightfully expects big things from freshman Jimmy Stone , prep All-America from Ohio , and Guard Herschell West . TEXAS SOUTHERN , denied its ninth Southwestern Athletic Conference title in 10 years by Grambling last season , does not expect to duplicate its good 18-7 record . Coach Isaac Moorehead lost his first nine regulars and most of the squad 's height . Leroy Manna , Charlie Moore and Vic Dupree are the heart of this year 's team .
