Illustration GEORGE LOVES GISTLA By JAMES McKIMMEY , Jr . " Why do n't you find yourself some nice little American girl , " his father had often repeated . But George was on Venus ... and he loved pale green skin ... and globular heads and most of all , George loved Gistla . George Kenington was sixteen , and , as he told himself , someone who was sixteen knew more about love than someone who was , say , forty-two . Like his father , for instance . A whole lot more probably . When you were forty-two , you got narrow-minded and nervous and angry . You said this is this , and that is that , and there is nothing else . When someone thought and felt and talked that way , George thought bitterly , there was not enough room inside that person to know what it was like , loving a Venusian . But George knew . He knew very well . Her name was Gistla . She was not pretty in standards of American colonists . She had the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather thick . Her face , of course , was not an American face . It was the face of native Venus . Round and smooth , with the large lidless eyes . There were no visible ears and a lack of hair strengthened the globular look of her head . But she was a person . The beauty was inside of her . Did you have to point to a girl 's face and say , " Here is where the nose should be , here is where the ears should be ? " Did you have to measure the width between eyes and test the color of the skin ? Did you have to check the size of the teeth and the existence of hair ? Was all of this necessary to understand what was inside someone ? George snapped a leaf from an overhanging vine and threw it angrily to the ground . He was walking along a thin path that led from the colony to the tangled hills beyond , where hues of red and yellow and purple reflected like bold sweeps of watercolor . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his eyes and the sweet perfume of the flowers in his lungs , he felt again the familiar rise of excitement . George had not always lived on Venus . The Colony was very new . By 2022 , most of the Earth countries had sent colonizers to Mars . But as yet , in June of that year , Venus had been touched by only the sparsest invasion of American civilization . George had arrived just three years ago , when his father had been appointed Secretary of the colonizing unit . And that was the whole trouble , really . Father was the Secretary , Mother was the Secretary 's wife , Sister was the daughter of the Secretary . Everybody was wrapped up in it . Except George . George loved Gistla . " Why do n't you find yourself some nice little American girl ? " his father had said . " Say like Henry Farrel 's little daughter ? " Henry Farrel 's little daughter was a sweet sickening girl with a nasty temper and a nasty tongue . Her father was Governor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Or , " his father had told him , " why not little what's-her-name , Doug Brentwood 's daughter ? " Little what's-her-name 's father was the President of the Council . " My father is President of the Council , " she said . Over and over , as though in a settlement the size of the Colony , there would be anyone who would n't know her father was the President of the Council . It was all a very tight and careful circle , chosen on Earth with a great deal of " common sense . " There were the ordinary settlers , of course . They had daughters . Some of them were very pretty and long-limbed . And George had thought about that . Certainly there was n't a decent-looking girl in the whole Governing circle , and the sight of a girl with flashing eyes and a nice red mouth , who was shaped a little like something besides a tree stump , was indeed an exciting sight . But there were limitations to the settler girls . They had no background to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference , George assured himself , they knew nothing about art , music , poetry , or anything really worth while . And , too , while George 's father had said , " Now , George , we 're all one here . Each of us is as good as another . Joe Finch , who cares for the flowers outside , is every bit as good a man as I am "  --  still George knew , if he told his parents he was going to marry Joe Finch 's daughter someday , there would be hell to pay . So as long as the restrictions had been bound around him , there was no reason to go just half-way . George was not an ordinary boy . He did things in extreme . He was now in love with a Venusian girl , and his family was already starting to make him pay . * * * * * George turned off the path , just beyond an arch of thick purple-green vines that always reminded him of a gate to a garden . There was a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was an aloneness to it , and only the sound of the flat shiny leaves sliding together and the high , trilling sound of the small Venusian birds broke the peaceful silence . They had always met here , nowhere else . Now , as George found himself in the clearing , he began to wonder what Gistla would say or do when he told her he was taking her home to meet his family . It had been a sudden decision , brought out of anger and indignation . George sat down upon the flat hollow of a large vine . The sky was murky as usual , but the soft warm feel and smell of the growth around him , with its color and brightness , made up for a sunless sky . As he waited , he remembered what his mother had said : " Oh , George , you 're really not serious about bringing a Venusian into our home ! " And his sister , Mari , had said , " My God ! " Mari , who was eighteen , said this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert , had said , " No , now if George wants to bring one of these , ah , Venusians home with him , that 's his privilege . I think it would be very interesting . " George knew what his father meant by interesting . Exposing Gistla to his family would result in deliberate sarcasm and eye-squinting and barely hidden smiles . There would be pointed remarks and direct insults . And when it was over , George knew , he would be expected to see the error of his ways . He would then be expected to forget about this odd creature and find himself a nice ignorant little Colony girl , whose father was a member of the Governing circle . " And to hell with that , too , " George said . " What ? " George heard Gistla say . He turned quickly . She was standing at the edge of the clearing , her round green eyes looking soft and serious . She wore the usual gray cape that reached her ankles . Her voice was a deep round sound , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned so quickly since the Colony had begun . " Talking to myself , " George grinned . The old excitement was inside of him . There was a kind of exotic quality in meeting Gistla that never disappeared . She crossed the clearing , not too gracefully , and touched her fingers against his hand . This had been the extent of their physical expression of love . " It is nice to see you , George . " He noticed his feeling of pleasure when he heard her speak his name . There was something about his own name being spoken by Gistla that had always seemed even more strange than anything else . She sat down beside him , and they looked at each other while the leaves whispered around them and the birds fluttered and chirped . He discovered again the feeling of rightness , sitting beside Gistla . There was a solidity about her , a quiet maturity that he seemed able to feel in himself only when he was with her . And that too was strange , because in American terms of age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were doing , silent , watching each other , had been most of their activity . You did not need to entertain Gistla with foolish small-talk or exaggerated praising . But right now he wanted to tell her quickly , to make sure that she would feel the enthusiasm he had felt . " Listen , Gistla , " he said , while she watched him with her soft-looking round eyes . " I want you to come with me today to meet my family . " His words seemed to have an odd ring to them , and George waited tensely until he was sure that she was not shocked or angry about what he had just said . She sat silently for a moment and then she said , " Do you think that is right for me to do , George ? " " Sure it is ! Why not ? They know about you and me . They know we 're in love . " " Love  --  " She spoke the word as though it were an indefinite , elusive thing that you could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise , George realized , but this was a time for enthusiasm , a time to strengthen their own relationship in this world . " Say you will ! " George said . " Do you want me to ? " " Well , sure I do . What did you think ? " She held her hands in her lap quietly . They were not unlike his own , George observed , except for the extreme smallness and the color . " I do not think it will be nice for you or them , " she said . " Ah , listen , Gistla . Do n't talk that way . It 'll be fine ! " But he knew that he was not deceiving her with the lightness he tried to put into his voice . Then , although she had never done it before , she reached out and touched his cheek . George had grown used to the emotions that reflected on her face , and he knew she was suddenly very sad . " Yes , George , " she said . " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said it as though she were telling him good-by. * * * * * It was no better than he had expected . It was worse . Much worse . And he was growing angrier by the moment . They were all seated in the rock-walled patio behind the large white house . Gistla sat beside him , looking very small and frightened and very different . And it was that obvious difference that George had hoped everyone might ignore . But instead , each of them , his father , his mother , his sister , appeared to be trying to make it even more obvious . The first strain , when everyone had sat there staring at Gistla as though she were something behind a cage , had passed . But now his parents and sister were moving in a new direction . They had relaxed , having found control of the situation , and they were cutting her to pieces . " Tell me , " his sister was saying , her eyes dancing slyly , " do n't you people have some very strange tricks you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms . He heard Gistla answer , " Tricks ? " " Yes . " His sister 's white smile shined . " You know , like making things disappear , things like that . " " My father , " Gistla said seriously , " can do very wonderful things . He is a musician . " George 's father leaned forward , blinking amusedly . " Really ? What does he play ? " " Play ? " asked Gistla . " Yes . He 's a musician . He must play something , some kind of instrument . " Gistla looked at George , but George did not know what to say . He wished he had never tried to do this . He wished he had just ignored his family and gone on loving Gistla in the privacy of his own emotions . " Well , now , " Mr. Kenington was saying rather impatiently . " Does he play something like our violin or clarinet or oboe , or what ? " His father , George had noticed , was becoming impatient more frequently since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He does not play anything , " Gistla said carefully . " He just ... makes the music and I hear it . " " But how ? " Mr. Kenington insisted . " What does he play the music on ? He certainly ca n't make the music without using something to make it on . " Gistla glanced again at George and he said quickly , " It 's pretty hard to understand , Father . I do n't think  --  " " No , now do n't interrupt just now , son . This is very interesting . We 'd like to know what she 's talking about . " Mrs. Kenington spoke for the first time . " Are you just making this up ? " It was like a whip coming through the air . His mother sat there , blinking , the suspicion and distrust she felt for this creature showing in her eyes and upon her mouth and even in the way she was sitting . " Now , Lois , " Mr. Kenington said , as though he really sympathized with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making it up , but that all of her race made everything up . But he was stubborn . " Come now , tell us . Tell us what you mean . " Gistla 's smooth head turned this way and that . " Sometimes , " she said slowly , " my father journeys to other places , and if he can not return soon , he sends me music . When the light has gone from the day and I am alone , I hear it . " " You mean he sends it by wires or by radio ? " Mr. Kenington asked with surprise . " No . " " Now , wait a minute , " George 's sister leaned forward , smiling . " You just hear this music , is that right ? Up here . " She tapped her forehead . " Yes , " said Gistla . " My God , " George 's sister said . She looked at her parents , arching her eyebrows . " You should n't make things up , " George 's mother said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's not making things up ! " " Just a moment , son , " Mr. Kenington said crisply . " You do n't want to talk to your mother in that tone . " " No , but , my God , " George 's sister went on . " Imagine . No wires , no loudspeakers , just ... up here . " She tapped her forehead again . " I 'm not talking to my mother in any tone at all , " George said , disregarding his sister . " Well , she should n't lie , " said Mrs. Kenington with conviction . George stood up . " She is not lying , Mother . " " I forbid you to argue with your mother that way , George , " said Mr. Kenington . " I mean , my God , " said George 's sister happily . " This is an innovation ! Can you imagine ? Gistla , or whatever your name is , could your father make his music sometime when we have a dance ? " Gistla 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused . She shook her head . Mrs. Kenington was blinking accusingly . " Do they teach you to make these things up ? Is that what they teach you at home ? " " Mother , will you please ? " George said . " Why must you talk to her that way ? " Mr. Kenington stood up quickly . " I did not raise my son to show an attitude like that to his mother . " " But she is n't making this up , " George said . " You asked her to tell you and she  --  " George 's sister had jumped out of her chair and she was waltzing over the patio . She began humming as she danced . " Ca n't you just see it ? Everyone dancing around , listening to music in their heads ? No orchestra or records or anything ? " Mr. Kenington stood very tall . " Are you taking the word of your mother , or this ... this ... " He motioned curtly at Gistla . George licked his lips , looking defensively at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of taking anyone 's word at all . It 's just something we do n't understand . " George 's sister whirled and then suddenly she stopped , putting her hand against her mouth . " My God , what if everyone got the music different ? I mean , does everyone hear the same music , dear ? Because if they did n't , what a mess ! " She began dancing again , her skirt swirling over the bricks of the patio . Mr. Kenington 's voice was louder . " I think we understand , all right , George . There is n't anything about this we do n't understand ! " George 's lips were paling . His sister dipped and turned . " We could call it a Music In The Head dance . Everybody brings his own head ! " She laughed merrily . " My God ! " George noticed then that Gistla was disappearing out of the rear gate . He stood , clenching his fists and glaring at his family . His sister had stopped dancing but she was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his mother said resolutely , " that you were going to invite someone who lied . " George turned and ran after Gistla. * * * * * They sat again in the clearing . George could still feel the anger churning inside him , and he held his hands together so tightly that his fingers began to ache . " I hate them for that , " he said . Gistla touched his arm . " No , George . It is all right . It is the way things are . " " But they do n't need to be ! My family did that on purpose . " " They just do n't understand . My race is very different from yours and it seems strange . " " So does mine , " George said , standing and beginning to pace back and forth . It had been what he really had expected . But still he had hoped , somehow , that his family might have understood . He looked at Gistla , sitting quietly , her large eyes watching him . He knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he ever had before , because she had been refused by his family . " Listen , Gistla , " he said , kneeling on the grass in front of her . " It wo n't make any difference what anyone thinks or does or says . I love you , and I 'll go on loving you . We 'll build our own life the way we want it . " She shook her head slowly . " No , George . It does make a difference . You can not forget your family or your people . That is important to you . I would only hurt you . " " Do you love me ? " " Yes . " " Then that 's all that 's important to me . Not what anyone thinks . Not what my sister thinks or my father or my mother . " " We are different , you and I. " She sat unmoving , her smooth face unchanging . " My people seem strange to yours because we can do things your people do not understand . We seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we value things differently . " " My values are the same as yours , " George pleaded . " I love you because of what you are , not because of some kind of stupid chart for physical beauty , not because ... " " George , " she said . " Look at me . " George met her eyes suddenly , caught by the urgency in her voice . And slowly , in front of his eyes , she changed . Her features shifted , until George saw a beautiful young girl with pink white skin and red lips . He saw shining blue eyes and shimmering golden hair that fell over her shoulders . Gistla 's body had changed to a lithe , smooth figure that revealed its contours beneath the gray cape . He caught his breath and wiped a hand at his eyes . " What you see , " said Gistla softly , " is an illusion . You see what would be in your values , a beautiful girl . " George opened his mouth but was unable to find his voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion of your senses , I am still Gistla . I am still a Venusian . " George reached out and touched his fingers against a white arm and a white shoulder bared by the cape . He touched the golden hair . " Gistla , " he said , amazed . " You 're beautiful . " " Yes , " she said sadly . " But  --  you really are ! Your hair and your eyes and your mouth . How did you do it ? " She shook her head to show its unimportance . " It is something  --  like your hypnotism . " George raised himself from his knees and sat beside her . " But I ca n't believe it ! " " You can see , you can feel . " " Yes , " George said . " Yes . " " You are happy with me this way , are n't you , George ? " " But you 're so beautiful . " The golden-haired girl nodded her head , and the shining blue eyes watched him carefully . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a difference . You love me more this way . " " No , " George said , touching her hair again . " I do n't love you more , but if you can do this , why then , we 'll have no more worries . Do n't you see ? " " I think so , " Gistla said , looking away . George 's voice was excited , and his eyes darted over her face and body . " Would other people see you as I do ? " " If I wished , yes . " " Then you see ? It 's all changed ! You are what I see . Golden-haired and pale-skinned  --  " " I am still Gistla . You would always know that . Would you love something that is not real , just because you see it with your eyes ? " * * * * * " But I can feel that you 're real , " George said , putting his hands on her shoulders . He pulled her closer and kissed her hair . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're beautiful . " He tipped her face up to his and bent to kiss her mouth . His lips touched smooth green skin and he looked into Gistla 's large round lidless eyes . He recoiled as though he had been touched by fire . She watched him as he wiped a trembling hand across his chest , and her globular head glistened in the reflection of the late sun . She nodded . " When you see what I really am , the difference is important . " She gathered her cloak around her and stood up . George felt the flush of his face , and he could not meet her eyes . He heard her walk a few steps away . " Good-by , George , " she said . He jumped up quickly . " That was n't fair . " " No , " she said slowly , " but it proved the value of things . " " It was n't fair , " George repeated . " And it did n't prove anything . " " I think it did , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gistla , " he said . " You ca n't judge anything by what I did or said . We are different , in a physical sense , but that does n't really matter . If a golden-haired girl materializes in front of my eyes , you ca n't blame me for what my emotions did . It 's still you I love . Not the color of your skin or the shape of your mouth . But you and what you or I or anybody else looks like is n't important ! " He followed her and caught her arm . She turned to face him . " You can say that , " she said . " Your words tell me that and your eyes , but I know it is n't true . " The embarrassment was still inside him , but the way she denied him made him want her more than ever . He held to her arm and then he said , " Gistla , could you change me ? I mean , so that other people , even I , would see me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood very still , staring at him . " Could you ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Then do it , Gistla . I 'll prove to you that nothing is important but you and me . I 'll be a Venusian , like you are . I 'll go back to my family as a Venusian and I 'll take you with me . I 'll prove that neither they nor anybody else makes any difference in how I love you ! " Gistla watched him solemnly . Finally she said , " Would you really do that ? " " Yes , " he said quickly , " Yes . " " I love you , George , " she said in her deep round voice . He lifted his hands to touch her face and he found that his skin had turned to pale green . He touched his own face , and he knew that if he looked into a mirror he would see a round smooth head with large lidless eyes . " Is that what you wanted ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what I wanted . " He stood there for a long time , trying to become used to it , fighting the fear that ran through him every time he looked at his hands or touched his head . Finally he said , quietly , " Let 's go meet my family . " * * * * * As they drew near the house , he knew his family was still in the patio . He could hear the voices of his mother and father and the high , piercing laughter of his sister . " And , my God , " he heard his sister say , " did you see the way those horrible eyes looked at you ? What ever gets into George ? " " Dear , dear , dear , " he heard his mother say . Gistla was looking at him . " You do not have to do this . " " Yes , " he said , feeling his heart jump . " I do . " He took her hand and they walked to the gate of the patio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his own . And as he said , " Hello , everybody , " he felt his breath shorten as though he had suddenly gotten stage fright . He saw his father turn around . " What 's this ? " Mr. Kenington said , frowning . " Hello , Father , " George said . " Father , " Mr. Kenington repeated . " What are you doing in this patio ? " " I brought Gistla back . " " So I see , " said Mr. Kenington , his eyes narrow as he looked at Gistla . " Where 's George ? " " I 'm George . " " I 'm not in the mood for joking with Venusians , " his father snapped . " What made you think you could come in here like this ? " Gistla 's hand tightened again . " Try to understand , " George said . " Gistla  --  " " What 's going on ? " his sister interrupted . " Gistla , or whatever her name is , " Mr. Kenington said , " has brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the word , Venusian , as though it were a curse or a filthy word . " My God , " said his sister , squinting at them . Mrs. Kenington leaned over in her chair , peering . " Tell them not to come into the patio , Harry , " she said to her husband . " Listen , Father , " George said , feeling the panic begin . " Gistla changed my appearance , so that I seem to look like a Venusian . I came here to tell you that it does n't make any difference what I look like , whether I look like a Venusian or a leaf on a vine or anything else . I still love her , and it does n't make any difference . " He heard his voice rising and becoming louder . " My God , " said his sister , giggling . " More black magic . Can you make music ? " she asked George . " Harry , " his mother said . " They frighten me . Ca n't you make them keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . " Now see here , " Mr. Kenington growled . " You know we do n't allow Venusians around here . I 'd advise you to get out of here . Quick ! " " Why does he keep calling you father and mother ? " his sister asked . " Is n't that queer , how he keeps doing that ? Make some music , " she said to George . George could see the hatred in his father 's eyes and in his mother 's . And behind his sister 's sarcastic smile , he could see the hatred there , too . He felt himself getting more tense , and the panic raced through him . " Listen , " he shouted . " I 'm George , do n't you understand ? George ! " " I do n't want to tell you again , " his father said , his face very red . " I do n't know what your little game is , but it is n't coming off , and so I 'll tell you just this one time . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Listen , " George yelled . " I 'm GEORGE ! Do n't you understand ? " His father 's lips thinned to a white line , and he began shouting for Joe Finch , the gardener . George knew what he should have done then , he should have taken Gistla and gone . He should have walked with her , hand in hand , down the road and away from there . But instead , the panic made his heart pound and he saw the hatred all around him . He could n't help it when he shouted to her , " Gistla ! For God 's sake , change me back ! Right now ! Gistla ! " He stood there , breathing hard , his muscles knotted like steel , while she stared at him , looking into his eyes . Suddenly , he heard his father gasp and say , " George ! " He looked at his hands and they were white and he felt of his face and it was his own . He saw his sister 's hand against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . His mother had gotten up and was coming over to him , her eyes blinking . " George , " she said , " what did they do to you ? " She patted his shoulder , her hands fluttering like bird wings . He turned back to Gistla and she was gone . Beyond the gate now , he knew , and walking slowly , alone , down the road . Only this time he would not go after her . He could n't . And as he stood there , feeling his mother 's hand patting his shoulder , hearing his sister say , " My God , " seeing his father shake his head slowly , he felt very young and at the same time , very old , and he wanted to cry .
