txt Senate and House conferees agreed early today to extend the life of the Civil Rights Commission as Congress pressed for adjournment shortly before the dawn that would bring Premier Khrushchev to Washington . At 4:10 A. M. the House was , voting on the commission extension and a foreign-aid appro- , priation carrying ** for sustaining the mutual security program through the year ahead . The last major obstacle to adjournment had been removed at ' 9:50 P. M. yesterday when the Senate . after a final twelvehour spasm of oratory , passed a two-year extension of the Civil Rights Commission . By an extraordinary parliamentary device , this had been attached only a few minutes earlier to the Senate version of the foreign aid appropriations bill . As a result of this unusual legislative marriage , one of the twenty-five Senators voting against the foreign aid bill was J. W. Fulbright , Democrat of Arkansas and chairman of , the Foreign Relations Committee . The House , which had been ready since Friday afternoon to , pass both provisions and adjourn for the year , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the House side of the ' Capitol , calls went out throughout the evening for more ice.1 and an occasional festive whoop came from committee rooms . Meanwhile , leaders of both , parties began issuing tradi- ' tonal end-of-session appraisals to be expounded and amplified by the faithful as the 1960 Presidential election campaign , gets under way . Speaker Sam Rayburn summed up for the controlling Democratic majority . " One of the most fruitful sessions I have ever attended since I 've been here . ' ' he said . The House Republican whip , Representative Leslie C. Arends of Illinois , hailed a Republican triumph of blocking " a return to the New Deal policy of spending with abandon . " Republicans , he said . had won " victory after victory for fiscal responsibility . " On the legislative front , extension of the Civil Rights Commission Was assured after the Senate leadership reached a bipartisan understanding . Northern liberals were satisfied that they would have a chance to act on comprehensive rights legislation on the Senate floor by the middle of February . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two leaders , Lyndon B. Johnson , Democrat of Texas , ' and Everett Dirksen , ' Republican of Illinois . This was how the situation developed : In order to attach ' the commission extension to ' the foreign aid bill the leadership needed a - tiVo- thirds vote of the Senate . This they got by a vote 171 to " 18 . With the rules now suspended , civil rights advocates were technically free to . try - to attach a comprehensive rights ' bill to the. - appropriation , Southern members - roared demands for an : immediate vote . Bat Senator Jacob K. Javits ; - Republican of New York , insisted on being heard . He wanted assurances , he said , that there would be a chance early next year to act on a civil rights bill on the Senate floor . Mr. Dirksen said there was " some agreement now that this could be done on or after Feb. 15 . " Senator Johnson , carrying out the prearranged plan , said he , wanted to " inform every Senator that there would be a motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by " some Senator " to place the civil rights question before the Senate . Senator Javits asked Mr. Dirksen if he would be the one to make this ' motion . " If the Lord is willing and I am alive , " Senator Dirksen replied . In quick order the Senate then voted to attach the commission rider to the aid bill , then to pass the entire package . The vote for the Civil Rights , Commission was the same as , that on suspending the rules , ' 71 to 18 . This removed the last possi bility of a protracted fight this ca-sion on the civil rights issue . Southern Democrats , satisfied that the civil rights bill was dead for this session , confined themselves to a day of routine denunciation of the Civil Rights Commission and their colleagues who want a new rights bill . The Southerners centered much of their fire on New York City 's recent outburst - of juvenile violence and the argument that it was the inevitable product of racial integration in the community . . Aside from one sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina , the day 's show played before an abandoned Senate floor and frequently yawning galleries . The reason had been clear for more than a week . The Southerners lacked the votes to prevent extension of . the commissi-n and they knew it . The civil rights faction had no substantial backing for a fight to enact a rights bill this session had decided to settle for the promise of a chance to fight another day . Thus , it came down to an exercise in oratory calculated for hometown newspaper consumption , with every member knowing in advance what the voting ' MItcome would be . Under the old law , the Civil Rights Commission would have expired Nov. 9 this year . Legislation to extend it was attached by the leadership to the yearend , catch-all appropriation bill , most of which carried funds for the foreign aid program . This unusual procedure could be carried out only under a suspension of Senate rules endorsed by two-thirds of the members present and voting . The motion to suspend the rules was made at ' 10:30 Saturday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suspend rules . It was interrupted by a recess at 12:04 Sunday morning , resumed at 9 o'clock this morning when the Senate met again , and continued until dusk . Circle Completed Thus , the Senate ended its session as it had begun it , arguing one of its revered rules in the context of civil rights . When the Senate met on Jan. 7 , it immediately plunged into a fight on Rule XXII , which allowed virtually unlimited debate . Proponents of a tightening-up contended that the Senate could not pass a civil , rights bill under the old rule . Their fight brought a slight modification , which some said was meaningless . Senator Johnson , who sponsored the modification replied then that this session would demonstrate that meaningful civil rights legislation could be passed under existing rules . Senator Johnson 's inability to make good on this statement was dramatized by tonight 's finale , which left the civil rights faction saying , in effect , " wait ' til next year . " Senator Javits aim senator Kenneth B. Keating , his New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights bill would be brought to the floor by Jan. 15 . Senator Johnson objected that this would be futile , because Republicans normally want a long moratorium on business during early February ' in order to travel for the Lincoln Day fund-raising dinners . agreed with Mr. Johnson . Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia . leader of the Southern Democratic bloc , served notice that he would not be party to any agreement to move a bill to the floor in 1960 , but would resist it with all his skill . " Whateven time is fixed " by a leadership understanding for bringing a bill to the floor , Southerners would " be here to protect the Constitution of the United . States from - those who attempt to violate it , " he said . During the day , Senator Thurmond chided Senator Javits for pressing for civil rights legislation instead of working to stop crime in New York City . He urged Mr. Javits to " let the poor South alone , " and contrasted New York violence with a picture of racial tranquility and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Democrat of Mississippi , declared that the South , unlike New York , did not have " gangs roaming the street  --  juvenile delinquency ? knifing ? cutting ? rap e  --  murder  --  filth ? " Yet , he . went on , Mr. Javits " has n't said a word about rape , about murder in his own neighborhood . " " Is n't a segregated life the proper life ? " He asked Senator Thurmond . " Is n't it the law of nature ? ' , " That 's the way God made the races , " Mr. Thurmond replied . Mr. Javits retorted that Federal crime statistics , in fact , showed that the crime ratio per hundred thousand of population was lower in New York City than in the South Carolina cities of Charleston , Greenville or Columbia . But comparing crime rates , he said , was a " red herring . " The relevant issue was whether a community 's attitude encouraged flouting of the Constitution or opposed it . Senator Thurmond suggested that Mr. Javits ' attitude was shaped by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are catering to that blod of votes to save your own political hide , " he charged . " I could be very cruel and ' ask the Senator what percentage of the population of his state he is serving , " Senator Javits replied . - But the argument " that I am demagoguing " did not touch the merits of the civil rights issue , he said .
