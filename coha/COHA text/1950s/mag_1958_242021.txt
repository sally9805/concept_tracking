A certain amount of unemployment , say from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 , is supportable . It is a good thing that job-seeking should go on at all times ; this is healthy for the economic body . <P> <P> This pronouncement by then-President Harry Truman was tossed off in a tradition-breaching exclusive interview that he gave New York Timesman Arthur Krock during the 1949-50 recession , and it had some cool-eyed economic truth in it . But last week , with the economy in a Republican recession ( mid-March unemployment : 5,198,000 ) , politically touchy Harry Truman publicly disowned his rare bit of economic wisdom . <P> Truman was appearing before the House Banking and Currency Committee to prescribe a damn-the-deficits recession cure : a $5 billion tax cut , plus plenty of extra federal spending . Iowa 's Republican Representative Henry O. Talle reminded him of the 1950 remark on unemployment . Snapped Harry Truman : " That exclusive interview never happened . It came out of the air . " <P> In the Times next day , Newsman Krock , 71 , told his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House before publication , and Truman 's press secretary assured Krock that the President had pronounced the text " accurate in every detail . " Furthermore , at his press conference shortly after the interview ran in the Times , Truman had tartly defended a President 's right to give an exclusive interview if he felt like it . The committee 's Democrats tried to block a Republican attempt to get Krock 's reply in the record . <P> Cooled off by week 's end , Truman admitted , after all , that the exclusive interview did indeed take place , wrote explanatory letters to Newsman Krock and Banking and Currency Committee Chairman Brent Spence .
