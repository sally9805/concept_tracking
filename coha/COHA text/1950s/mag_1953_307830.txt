Cheerfully battling a brisk breeze at London Airport for mastery of her smart , flared skirt , Britain 's 22-year-old Princess Margaret seemed singularly free of care as she returned home from Africa with her mother last week . But in their papers and over their teacups , her sister 's subjects , with rising heat , were arguing the pros &; cons of a possible marriage between her and 38-year-old R.A.F. Group Captain Peter Townsend ( TIME , July 20 ) , now safely banished to an office in the British embassy at Brussels . There was still no official or royal-family confirmation of the romance , and much tushing in the respectable press at the propriety of even discussing it . Unabashed , London 's tabloid Daily Mirror charged boldly into the heart of the matter by conducting a poll of its readers . Of 70,142 Mirror readers who wrote in , 67,907 urged that Princess Margaret be allowed to marry her divorced airman if she wished to ; 2,235 said that she should not .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
