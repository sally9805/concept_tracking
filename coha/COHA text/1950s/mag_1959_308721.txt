<P> The eyes of all Africa were on Nyasaland last week , but Kenya had its own special reason for feeling the tension . Back in the news was the dreaded name of Jomo Kenyatta , " Burning Spear , " the idol of the Mau Mau-and the man who put him there was the very same witness who helped put him in prison back in 1953 . <P> Star Witness Rawson Mbogwa Macharia , a frail little Kikuyu shopkeeper , testified six years ago that Kenyatta himself had given him the Mau Mau oath , that he had been stripped naked and made to walk seven times through an arch of banana leaves and to drink human blood . Last spring , hoping for money , Macharia made the rounds of Nairobi newspapers showing a letter to him from Kenya 's attorney general written before the trial . In return for his testimony , the letter said , the government would reward Macharia with a round-trip air ride to England , a two-year college course in public administration , protection for his family when he was away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Kenya government did indeed keep its promise , at a total cost of 1,500 , but nothing seemed to satisfy Macharia . Found unfit for one job , he huffily turned down another . A beer shop the government helped him to open flopped . Blaming all his troubles on the government , Macharia decided on revenge . In November he signed an affidavit for People 's Convention Party Leader Tom Mboya charging that the Kenya government had paid him to lie . <P> 29 a Month . The government , insisting that it had paid him only to testify , not to lie , promptly put Macharia on trial for signing a false affidavit . In its own defense it argued that some sort of inducement was necessary to get testimony , since 36 potential witnesses against Kenyatta had been murdered. * <P> Once again the prosecution was up against Kenyatta 's flamboyant old defense counsel , Denis Nowell Pritt , Q.C. , this time representing Macharia . He would bring forth evidence , said Pritt , that would make him ashamed of being English . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be physically ill . " <P> When the prosecutor produced an unpublished manuscript in which Macharia accused Kenyatta of being " the 100% leader of the Communist Party in Africa " and a man who had his own private Gestapo to kill enemies , Macharia insisted that the government had paid him 29 a month to write such lies . Finally Pritt called Kenyatta himself . <P> " I Told My People . . . " As a precaution against a Nairobi mob demonstrating in Kenyatta 's favor , the court was moved to Kitale , 200 miles to the north . Kenyatta 's seven-year sentence to " hard labor " is being spent as cook to six other Mau Mau leaders , and with a year off for good behavior , he is scheduled to be freed next month . Last week Kenyatta appeared in court in dapper leather jacket and carrying a silver-embossed ebony cane that was a gift of his followers . Whistling through a hole in his front teeth , he testified that he had never given anyone the Mau Mau oath . On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own arrest had unleashed the bloody uprisings . Like Archbishop Makarios on Cyprus , he disowned but failed to condemn terror . " I did as much as I could , " said he . " I told my people to let the Mau Mau disappear like the roots of the fig tree . "
