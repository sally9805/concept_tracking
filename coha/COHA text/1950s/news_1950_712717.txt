txt BRITAIN 'S PARTIES PREPARING TO MAKE FATEFUL DECISIONS Labor Must Adopt Legislative Program and Conservatives Will Weigh Challenge LIBERALS TO CHOOSE ROLE Speculation Centers on How Long Regime Will Last  --  The Budget May Bring Test By CLIFTON DANIEL Special to Too NEW Yolut TIMES , LONDON , Feb. ** political parties will have to make difficult and fateful decisions this week to meet the situation caused by the fact that as a result of last Thursday 's election the Government now in office has the smallest Parliamentary majority for more than a hundred years . The new Parliament , whose lease on life is of great uncertainty , will assemble for the first time on Wednesday . During the week the Labor Cabinet will meet at least once to decide upon its legislative program . On Tuesday Winston Churchill 's " shadow cabinet " will consider how best to exploit the Government 's precarious situation . On the same day the National , Committee of the Liberal party , ' which suffered a disaster at the polls but still has eight seats in the new House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play in Parliament . And on Wednesday Labor members of Parliament and the party 's National Exlcutive Committee will meet . Speculation today on the consequences of the election centered on the question , riot of whether the Labor Government could survive with a majority of ten seats or less , but how long it might last . The prevailing opinion was that it would remain in office a matter of months ; some said two or three , while others thought that a new election would be postponed for six months at least . There was no suggestion of an arrangement between the two major parties , but it was thought that there might be a tacit agreement not to appeal to the country again except after a decent interval . In the first place , there is essential business to be transacted  --  the voting of supplementary appropriations for defense and the Health Service and adoption of the budget  --  and it was presumed that all the parties would be willing to BRITAIN 'S PARTIES IN FATEFUL WEEK // forego partisan advantage until these matters were settled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was believed to be ready for another election just yet . Both of them need to reorganize , take stock of their policies and collect funds for another campaign . There were , however , two minority views of the probable duration of the Government . One of , these was that the opposition led by Mr. Churchill might decide upon an immediate challenge to the Government , either on the King 's speech outlining its legislative program or on the budget that will be presented early in April . If the Government could be defeated on either one of these issues it would be obliged to resign and seek a new mandate from the electorate . The King 's speech , drafted by the Cabinet , could be an innocuous and non-controversial document , but the budget might well be embarrassing to the Government . Throughout the recent election campaign the Conservatives charged that the Government had called the election in February to avoid facing the nation after the budget . Last year 's budget was extremely unpopular and if the Government is to meet all its financial commitments this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A harsh budget would give an opening to the Conservatives to attack the Government because one of their campaign promises was reduction of taxes . However , the Opposition might not catch the Government 's supporters off guard so early in the game and if the Labor party were able to rally its full strength in the House of Commons it could still defeat the Conservatives . Whether or not therattack the budget as a whole , the Conservatives presumably will try to change parts of it when it is considered point by point in the Committee of the Whole . Another view of the Government 's chances was stated today by The Observer , which said that it was not impossible for the Government to carry on . " Mr. Attlee can count on excellent party discipline , " the newspaper said , adding : " Moreover , a Prime Minister is not bound to resign if he is defeated by the House unless he has challenged a vote of confidence . There is no reason why a new Labor Government should not survive for a ' considerable time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget . " When the Labor members of Parliament meet on Wednesday Prime Minister Attlee and Deputy Prime Minister Herbert Morrison surely will tell them absolute solidarity is required , that the absence or inattention of any one of them might bring about defeat of the Government . Rigid discipline probably will be easier to enforce because most of the obstreperous rebels of the party have already been expelled and all who ran as independent candidates in the recent election were defeated by the party regulars . In brief , the rebellion has been shown to be unprofitable . At the moment the Government has a majority of ten votes over all the other parties in the House of Commons . There are three returns from the far north yet to be declared and the election to be held in the- Moss Side ? constituency of Manchester where the Conservative candidate/ died before the polling day . Miss Florence H. Horsbrugh , former Junior Minister who was one of the Conservative candidates defeated last week , was adopted tonight as the new candidate in Moss Side . Majority Might Fall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could be considerably strengthened if the eight Liberals , two Irish Nationalists and , one Independent Liberal , could be persua , ded to vote with the Government . Whatever the Conservatives may decide to do about the immediate issues before Parliament it seemed certain that they would try to force a showdown with the Government before the act to nationalize the iron and steel industry becomes effective on Oct. 1 and the industry actually is taken over on ' Jan. 1 , 1951 . Nationalization of steel was one of the sharpest points of dispute between the two parties in the recent campaign and the Conservatives will not let it pass without a challenge . The steel bill has become a law and no further legislation is required to implement it , but under its provisions the Government can not take any measures to enforce it , such as appointing members of the industry 's managing board , listing its securities and calculating the price to be paid for them , until Oct. 1 . The industry can not be taken under public control until Jan. 1 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Conservative majority in the House of Lords to give the voters a chance to declare themselves . The Conservatives now will claim that inasmuch as the Labor party received a minority of the popular vote it has not received a mandate to proceed with the ' nationalization of steel or of the other industries mentioned in its election program . This point was strongly made by the Opposition press over the week-end . The Sunday Times said today : " If the Labor Government has not yet been defeated , socialism certainly has . The verdict of the electors by a majority of 2,500,000 of the popular vote is flatly against it . To pursue a Socialist policy now would be to fly in the face of democracy . " Even Harold Laski , former chairman of the Labor party , wrote in Reynolds News that " Labor and Tory face each other in a manner which gives neither any authoritative claim to impose itself . " Nevertheless , there was speculation in ' the Opposition* newspapers that despite its minority status the Labor party might proceed full tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Health , was urging such a course . His absence from yesterday 's Cabinet meeting was taken to suggest a possible quarrel between him and his colleagues . Today , however , his sister and his political agent said that his absence was due to a simple indisposition ,
