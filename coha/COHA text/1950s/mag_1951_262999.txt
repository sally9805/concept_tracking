He teaches nine commercial-art courses at Waco 's Baylor University , and he has been commuting by air to Houston ( 160 miles ) to run a chalk-talk television program which last week won a prize as the most entertaining TV show in the city .

His most important job costs him more than $100 a week . <P> He spends almost every night at it-studying the Bible and drawing cartoons to illustrate biblical events and ideas , two of which are matted and mailed to newspapers each week-without charge .

But he turns down any suggestion that he charge for his cartoons , or invite " contributions " from the newspapers . <P> " I do n't want any gimmicks in this thing , " he says .
