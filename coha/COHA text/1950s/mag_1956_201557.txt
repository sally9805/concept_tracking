THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST ( 252 pp. ) - David Garneff-Harcourf , Brace ( $4.50 ) <P> An autobiographer is lucky if his subject is a fascinating fellow . David Garnett , Britain 's eminent , aging ( 64 ) novelist and critic , has accomplished the next best thing by having a lot of fascinating pals . In The Golden Echo , the first volume of his autobiography ( TIME , May 24 , 1954 ) , Garnett told of his childhood among such literary greats as Joseph Conrad , who taught him how to sail ( on the lawn ) , Henry James , who had him to tea , and " Jack " Galsworthy . Now Garnett has moved into another part of his private forest of first names . There are among others , Aldous ( Huxley ) , Maynard ( Lord Keynes ) , Virginia ( Woolf ) , Morgan ( E. M. Forster ) , Lytton ( Strachey ) and Rupert ( Brooke ) . <P> These were the most brilliant flowers of Bloomsbury , the domain of London 's intelligentsia that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official-and whose hothouse air Constance ( Garnett 's mother , translator of War and Peace ) breathed into her son . In the present volume Garnett , whom his friends all called " Bunny " , tells about World War I , but this is a war reminiscence of a special kind . For Bloomsbury 's Bunny was a conscientious objector . In 1914 Rupert , who was soon to write <P> If I should die , think only this of me : <P> That there 's some corner of a foreign field <P> That is for ever England . . . <P> invited Bunny to join his outfit-the Royal Naval Division . Instead , Pacifist Bunny plumped for a corner of an English field and ended up in Surrey digging turnips and forking dung for a farmer . <P> Thus The Flowers of the Forest is interesting on two counts : first for its skilled anecdotes of men of genius , and second for its implicit psychological portrait of a pacifist . Unlike those whose lot is but to do and die , the pacifist has to reason why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers ' tales . <P> The Hard Seat . One of the book 's more remarkable episodes concerns Author Lytton Strachey , like Garnett a pacifist . Summoned before a tribunal that was examining conscientious objectors for good faith , Strachey appeared , surrounded by his family and padded against the reality of hard benches with a private , pale blue air cushion . Asked the tribunal 's spokesman : " What would you do , Mr. Strachey , if you saw an Uhlan attempting to rape your sister ? " Whereupon , as Garnett tells it , " Lytton looked at his sisters in turn , as though trying to visualize the scene , and gravely replied in his high voice : ' I should try to interpose my own body . ' "
