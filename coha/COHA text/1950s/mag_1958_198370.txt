A Tale of Two Cities ( Rank ) , Dickens ' melodramatic thriller about the best of times and the worst of times , has been bouncing on and off the screen like a handball ever since 1911 , when James Morrison and Norma Talmadge nickered through three reels of heroism and anguish . The best of times arrived in 1935 , when the late Ronald Colman came through with a portrayal of the novel 's hero that had dash and dignity as well as the usual desuetude . In this latest attempt , British Actor Dirk Bogarde* gives it a game go , but he never quite fights his way out of a paper Carton . <P> True enough to the seven-leagued book , Carton is introduced as an untrustworthy , melancholy rummy-brilliant lawyer and all that , but essentially a tosspot . Bogarde flips his banister 's wig over happily married Lucic , and from then on , both sides of the English Channel are awash in his nobility . Director Ralph Thomas leaps like a mountain goat from peak to peak : Lucie 's love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets of Paris , and finally Sydney Carton 's self-sacrificing death to save Darnay . But inevitably the film must miss many of the deeper shadows between the peaks . <P> <P> Damn Yankees ( Warner ) . Hollywood 's version of Broadway 's long-running ( 2 years ) marriage of baseball and Beelzebub seems sure to draw more customers than the Los Angeles Dodgers , even though it too requires a screen . In this case the screen is an asset . Co-Directors George Abbott ( who did the stage musical ) and Stanley Donen have lathered it with offbeat color effects and the kind of all-over-the-lot bounce that on Broadway could only be suggested . As a cinemusical , Yankees manages to steal home by a wide margin . <P> The middle-aged hero ( Robert Shafer ) is that most pitiable of men , a Washington Senators fan . An offhand mention that he would sell his soul for a long-ball hitter brings on Ray Walston , a crewcut , button-down Screwtape always willing to oblige . With a flick of the wrist , Walston turns paunchy Rooter Shafer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Actor Hunter holds a bat as if it were a canoe paddle , he hits .524 and steals 976 bases as the Senators roar in pursuit of the Yankees . <P> But off the field Hunter causes Ol ' Debbil Walston no end of trouble by mooning about the wife he had to leave behind when he took on his new incarnation . " Wives , " declares Walston woundedly , " cause me more trouble than the Methodist Church . " In the longest-distance phone call in cinema history , he gets hold of Operative Lola ( Gwen Verdon ) , still infernally seductive at the age of 172 . Lola does not get what she wants , but the Senators do win the pennant and Hunter is mercifully transformed back into Robert Shafer .
