At 51 , Sir William Walton stands second in England 's current trinity of famous composers . Less prolific than either 80-year-old Ralph Vaughan Williams or 39-year-old Benjamin Britten , he has turned out some pieces ( e.g. , his Symphony and Viola Concerto ) that are considered better than any of their more celebrated works . In the U.S. he is known for Faade , an impudent accompaniment for Edith Sitwell 's eccentric verses ; Belshazzar 's Feast , a big dramatic choral work ; and Orb and Sceptre , a grandiose march commissioned for the coronation . Visiting the U.S. with his Argentine born wife , he will conduct these three works in the Hollywood Bowl this week . <P> Standing a well-proportioned six feet and looking something like a less rugged version of Cinemactor George Sanders , Sir William ( knighted in 1951 ) is a gracious example of a sheltered English composer . Unlike that other popular British musician , Sir Thomas Beecham , Walton is no heady phrasemaker , either in speech or music .

" Today 's white hope is tomorrow 's black sheep , " he remarked when he was 37 . " I seriously advise all serious composers to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always slow , fell off sharply , although he turned out excellent film scores for Laurence Olivier 's Hamlet and Henry V. <P> A Secret Love . For the past three years , he has been working on a new opera . " British composers , " says Walton , " are all writing operas now . " With about 20 minutes of music left to write , Walton thinks he may finish in another year . The work is Troilus and Cressida , based on Chaucer 's poem , not Shakespeare 's play ( " You ca n't set Shakespeare 's to music " ) , and the world 's top opera houses have already made bids for the premiere . The story , adapted by British Librettist Christopher Hassall , is practically foolproof opera material . The scene is
