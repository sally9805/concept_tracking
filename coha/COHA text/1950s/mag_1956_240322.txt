One by one , the 65 crystal chandeliers in the U.S. Capitol had been taken down , disassembled , washed prism by prism , reassembled and rehung . Twenty-two painters had brushed their way across Capitol Hill , cleaning and painting walls . By this week all was in readiness for the fall of the gavel opening the second session of the 84th Congress . <P> Every sign pointed to a long , noisy and hyperpolitical session , with nearly every word and deed aimed at next Nov. 6 . Most of what is said and done will be affected profoundly by the heartbeats of two men . Political maneuvering in and between both parties will be influenced by the condition of Dwight Eisenhower 's health and the course of his political decisions . The practical operations will revolve around the heart and hand of Texas ' Democratic Senator , Lyndon Johnson . <P> <P> When he arrived in Washington at week 's end , Majority Leader Johnson had a daily routine planned to hold down the strain on his own heart . He had not been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July ; he plans to stay there for only an hour at a time during this session . Each day he expects to be on hand from noon until 1 p.m. ; then he will retire to his second-floor office , off the Senate Gallery , for a two-hour nap . Late in the afternoon he will reappear on the floor briefly , roam the cloak rooms , head for home before 6 p.m . In case of crisis , Johnson 's vigilant colleagues will summon him from his hideaway . <P> One of the first major items of legislation on Lyndon Johnson 's calendar is not likely to ease the strain on many congressional hearts-including the majority leader 's . Passed by the House in the final hours of the last session and lying there ready to tear the Senate apart is a bill to exempt natural-gas producers from fed eral regulation . Texan Johnson and Demo crats from other gas-producing states are hot for the bill ; big-city Democrats , e.g. , Illinois ' Paul Douglas and Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey , are dead set against it ( they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also divided on the issue , but not as sharply as the Demo crats . Lyndon Johnson believes that in an election year it is best to get such a bomb shell out of the way early . <P> On other major issues party groupings will be clearer , although hardly ever unanimous . Key items : Farm Policy . Democrats will attempt to make a major issue of falling income on the farm , but Republicans hope to steal the ball by coming forward with a pro gram to put more money in the farmers ' pockets . The chances are against a return to high ( 90% of parity ) , rigid price sup ports as a general policy ; the chances are excellent for the establishment of a soil-bank plan , under which farmers would get cash benefits for switching land from surplus to soil-building crops . <P> Taxes . The odds still favor some kind of cut in personal income taxes , after long , loud arguments between Republicans and Democrats about whether , who , what and when . But no action is expected until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax returns for 1955 and gauged the prospects for ' 56 and ' 57.
