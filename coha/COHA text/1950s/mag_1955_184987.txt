Voice-Powered Radio . The Army Signal Corps has developed a radio transmitter that needs no energy except electricity generated by the speaker 's voice . The trick would be impossible if the set used vacuum tubes , but all it has is a single transistor , which needs only a faint current . When the speaker 's voice makes the microphone vibrate , it generates enough current to operate the transistor and put the voice on the air . The present model , small enough to fit in a telephone mouthpiece , can transmit 600 ft . Later models , says George Bryan , developer of the set , should be good for a full mile . <P> Next step will be to build a voice-powered receiver . It will store up voice-electricity while the speaker is talking , then use it to pick up the answer while he is listening . Bryan believes that the entire outfit can be tucked into a plastic container no bigger than a matchbox . Mass-produced cost : $20 . <P> Sun-Powered Telephone . When Bell Telephone Laboratories told about its silicon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it promised to find practical work for it as soon as possible . Last week Bell told how one of these batteries ( 432 quarter-sized silicon disks in an aluminum frame ) is gathering solar energy for a rural telephone line near Americus , Ga . At night or in dark weather the line works on storage batteries charged when the sun is shining .
