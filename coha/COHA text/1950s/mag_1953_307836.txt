In a makeshift courtroom , surrounded by barbed wire and police with Sten guns , sat the two bewigged and red-robed justices of the Kenya supreme court . Spectators in the courtroom were searched for guns . Hundreds of armed police and settlers strolled the streets of the remote little town of Kitale . The court was met to hear the appeal of Moscow-trained Jomo ( " Burning Spear " ) Kenyatta and five of his loyal followers , sentenced to seven years ' hard labor last April for being the brains behind the Mau Mau terrorist movement . <P> Defense Attorney D. N. Pritt , a Londoner who makes a specialty of defending Communist causes , ticked off 60 grounds of appeal for Kenyatta , at least 20 for each of his associates .

Up jumped Defense Attorney Pritt to protest that " a new trial . . . would be vexatious and oppressive . . .

" The defendants , he said , could not afford another trial . <P> Calmly , the two Supreme Court judges replied : " The nature of the charges . . . is particularly grave . If they are guilty , they ought not to escape the consequences of their acts . " <P> Outside the courtroom , in the hot Kenya sun , bearded , burly Kenyatta and his five followers were taken into custody once more . In South Nyeri , Mau Mau terrorists had just killed 13 loyal Kikuyu . In London , British Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttelton told Laborite critics in the House of Commons that , in Britain 's relentless and increasingly successful counter-efforts , 1,300 suspected Mau Maus have been killed .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
