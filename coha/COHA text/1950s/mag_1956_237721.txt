Scurrying from caucus room to caucus room in search of his mislaid presidential nomination , Candidate Adlai Stevenson allowed himself to be poked , prodded , pushed and paraded until he felt , as he put it , like a prize Angus on display . Occasionally he asked one of his aides : " How am I doing ? " The reply was invariably : " Fine , Governor . " That was all Stevenson knew or needed to know while managers worked desperately behind the scenes last week to put out the flames that Harry Truman had torched by spurning Stevenson and declaring for Averell Harriman ( TIME , Aug. 20 ) . <P> The big question as Chicago 's big week began : Could Adlai ride out the Truman crisis and protect the huge lead he had collected ? The answers lay in the abacus mind and the horny fists of his campaign manager , Pennsylvania 's Jim Finnegan . <P> Come for the Ride . Finnegan 's own Pennsylvania was the first hot spot . The day after Truman 's flare-up , President David McDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that he too was for Harriman . McDonald 's steelworkers are mighty in Pennsylvania , and some Philadelphia delegates were raring to go with him . The Pennsylvania delegation caucused , and Dave McDonald made a fiery pitch for Harriman support . But Finnegan 's protege , Governor George Leader , laid out the political facts of life . Snapped he : if any delegate hoped to do any future business with Harrisburg , he had blamed well better stick with Stevenson . Result : a flame out for Harriman 's chances in Pennsylvania . <P> Stevenson " fire spotters " ( including Adlai Stevenson III ) fanned out among the other combustible delegations . Arizona started to burn ; it was cooled after a perilously close call . Kansas seemed ready to go ; the fire fighters won again . Even at midweek the faction-torn Maryland delegation began thinking about switching to Missouri 's Senator Stuart Symington . Jim Finnegan got the word , made an emergency call . " Boys , " said Finnegan , by that time on his third pack of Old Golds , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . You can come along later-just for the ride . But just think how good you 'll look back home if you can help swing this thing by leading the way , not following . " The Maryland boys caught on fast . <P> A Hand from Eleanor . Adlai Stevenson meanwhile played the part of the candidate well . As he went from meeting to meeting , his pitch was low-keyed , without personal resentment against Harry Truman . " My fight , " he said , " is against the Republicans , not against any Democrat . " Old friends rallied around him . Plowing through the crushing crowds with Stevenson was an especially devoted and notedly effective helper : Eleanor Roosevelt , 71 , wearing an absurd little hat and carrying herself with gentle dignity . She spoke repeatedly of her concern for a better world , a better America , and a Democratic Party in which the old , e.g. , herself and Harry Truman , must make way for the young , i.e. , Adlai Stevenson . " My husband , " said she meaningfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
