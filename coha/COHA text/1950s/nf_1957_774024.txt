txt // meaningful symbols that we call a language illustrates the superorganic quality of culture . The language of a society is not dependent upon the life of any single member . If all the members were suddenly wiped out , together with all written records , the language would presumably come to an end . Under ordinary conditions , however , the language is passed on from individual to individual and group to group as a " superorganic product . " It is this aspect of culture that Kroeber calls " the super-organic. " 14 8 . The most extensive examination of the concept of culture has been made by Kroeber and Kluckhohn . They first studied the history of the word culture and its meaning in various linguistic settings . They then surveyed the definitions of culture under the following headings : descriptive , historical , normative , psychological , structural , and genetic . Following this , they investigated the various statements about culture , dealing with its nature , components , and properties , as well as the relations between culture and psychology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitions alone number 164 , not counting the various statements about culture that number in the thousands . The extent of this literature suggests the importance of the concept of cul ture for the social scientist.15 In summarizing their own ideas , Kroeber and Kluckhohn have not attempted to add a 165th definition of culture , but rather to indicate their own thinking in this field . They suggest : 16 Culture consists of patterns explicit and implicit , of and for behavior acquired and transmitted by symbols , constituting the distinctive achieve ment of human groups , including their embodiments in artifacts . The essential core of culture consists of traditional ( i.e. , historically derived and selected ) ideas and especially their attached values ; culture systems may , on the one hand , be considered as products of action , on the other hand as conditioning elements of further action . On the basis of these and related definitions , we may formulate our own conception of culture . Culture , therefore : ( a ) is the characteristi cally human product of social interaction ; ( b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs ; ( c ) is cumulative as it is handed down from generation to generation in a given society ; // is meaningful to human beings because of its symbolic quality ; is learned by each person in the course of his development in a particular society ; ( f ) is therefore a basic determinant of personality ; and ( g ) depends for its existence upon the continued functioning of the society but is independent of any individual or group . CHARACTERISTICS OF CULTURE Culture thus exists in the minds or habit structures of the members of a society . Culture is visible in the behavior of individuals , as they engage in various forms of learned behavior . There are degrees of visibility of cultural behavior , ranging from the regularized activities of persons to their internal ( and often unconscious ) reasons for so doing . Boys and girls of high school age , for example , engage in be havior that is regularized by the teen-age culture in which they participate . Their reasons for dating , dancing , and related behavior are equally cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls may be having a date because they wish to appear popular , not because of any special affection for their temporary companion . This wish for social approval is part of the cultural behavior learned by the boy and girl , even though it is not as apparent as their physical behavior.17 These two aspects of behavior have been characterized by Kluckhohn as the " explicit " and the " implicit " culture . The explicit culture com prises " those regularities in word and deed which may be generalized straight from the evidence of the ear or eye . " 18 The similarities in the behavior of teen-agers at a dance are thus part of the explicit culture , since they comprise behavior that can be analyzed directly from the sensory evidence . On the explicit level , the adolescent cultural behavior can be generalized from regularities in dress , mannerisms , and con versation . The implicit culture , in Kluckhohn 's words , " is an abstraction of the second order . Here the anthropologist infers least common denom inators which seem . . . to underlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On this level , the cultural motivations may be assumed // from the variety of behavior of the teen-agers in question . The implicit wish for social approval is a culturally-induced motivation that may be inferred from the group behavior . The implicit culture is a generaliza tion of the second order . Culture is an abstraction . The basic reality is human behavior and the products of that behavior . We can not see culture as such ; we can only see human behavior . This behavior occurs in regular , patterned fashion and from this regularity we infer the existence of something that we call culture . We shall consider culture patterns in the next chapter . Here we merely indicate that human beings act in accordance with systems of group expectations . The forms can be inferred from the action ; they can not be envisaged as such . We can see people eating , drinking , working , marrying , fighting , and engaging in many other forms of social interaction . When we examine these activities , we see that they are not individualized and random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity are abstractions that the observer draws . The participants are rarely aware of the patterned nature of their behavior.20 In this sense , culture may be viewed simply as " regularities of be havior in the members of a particular society . " 21 Culture is not a force , operating by itself and independent of the human actors . There is an unconscious tendency to reify culture ? to endow it with life and treat it as a thing . Culture is a creation of society in interaction and depends for its existence upon the continuance of society . In a strict sense , therefore , culture does not " do " anything . It does not " cause " the individual to act in a particular way , nor does it " make " the normal individual into a maladjusted one . Culture should not , strictly speaking , be the subject of a transitive verb . It is logically incorrect to abstract culture from human behavior and then say that the culture " causes " the activity we have just observed . Culture , in short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with life.22 Culture is the source of much , but not all , of the uniformity of human behavior . Folkways , mores , and the rest of the normative group ex pectations are examples of culture . They are generated in social inter-action , transmitted to the new generation , and constitute a previously defined set of responses . The child finds his ways of behaving already // worked out for him , and he must follow these ways if he is to be a successful member of the group . The society derives the benefits of uniformity in the behavior of its members , and this would be impossible without culture . Each individual acquires the uniformities that are necessary to his adaptation to the group and the ultimate survival of the society . The majority of persons judge other cultures in terms of their own . The values of each culture constitute the only criteria of the folkways and mores of another . The person reared in a culture stressing Chris tianity , monogamy , and capitalism inevitably tends to regard Moham medanism , polygamy , and communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as ethnocentrism ? the literal act of regarding one 's culture as the center of the universe and hence as the basis for all comparisons with other cultures.23 The comparative study of cultures is difficult for most persons , for they lack the ability to view other cultures , not to mention their own , in an objective and scientific spirit . In an earlier period , when societies lived in comparative isolation , ethnocentrism was comparatively unim portant . Under present conditions of closer international relations , the individual must break down his suspicions of other cultures , at least to the point of a willingness to live and let live.24 In the scientific study of societies , the student must therefore under-stand values other than those of his own culture . He must be willing to judge other cultures as functioning wholes , to realize that what is good or bad for one culture may not necessarily be so for another . In this sense , a culture may be considered " good " in terms of its capability of " satisfying ( a ) human needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insofar as it is capable of satisfying the desires which itself , the cultural system , or its predecessors , has created . " 25 A culture that does not satisfy either the physical needs of its members or the needs arising from the culture itself is thus a " bad " culture . The comparison should not be based upon the values of a particular culture , such as our own , but rather upon the degree to which the culture measures up to the biological and cultural needs of the given society.26 // FORMS OF CULTURE We have previously considered culture as the regularities assumed by observing human behavior . In this sense , it is intangible and can not be experienced directly with the senses . In another sense , however , culture is tangible and can be experienced with the senses . This arises from the fact that regularities of behavior give rise to physical products . The many material elements in the physical frame-work of society fall in this latter category . In our society , automobiles , razors , shoes , pencils , desks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast conglomeration of material manifestations growing out of cultural interaction . The variety of these material elements may be indicated in the catalogue of a mail order house , where thousands of elements of the most complex material culture the world has ever known are displayed . Material culture is clearly the product of man . No one would pre sume that the automobile sprang full-blown from the brow of some supernatural power . The automobile is the product of a long line of cultural innovations , each adding something to the product . These innovations can be traced in a continuous line , beginning with the wheel and ending with the latest streamline model . Man alone wrought with hands and brain to produce the cultural developments that culmi nated in the automobile . The physical results of these mental processes are there for everyone to see . Material culture is the externalization or physical manifestation of the meaningful cultural interaction of human beings.27 Nonmaterial culture likewise has a human source . We have consid ered the process whereby folkways , mores , laws , and other normative expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ities are often associated with supernatural powers , and these provide many of the sanctions for them . The group expectations comprising the present social codes grew out of cumulative experience in very much the same sense as the invention of the wheel culminated in the auto-mobile . The nonmaterial aspects of culture do not , it is true , always show the consistency of development of many material aspects . Some contem porary group norms are not demonstrably superior to those of two thousand years ago , whereas the automobile is patently superior to the oxcart as a means of transportation . The human aspect of culture , how- // ever , applies to all of these manifestations . Man makes his culture with his mind . Some aspects remain in psychological form and others are physical . Culture , therefore , has two forms or levels , both products of mean ingful interaction . All culture is , in final analysis , a pattern ( s ) of regularized human behavior . Social interaction is the source of this behavior . The . first level of culture is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material objects ) in a particular system . , The second level is the nonmaterial or " ideological , " and includes the meanings , values , norms , and relationships . These are levels of culture , not dif ferent types.28 The fundamental basis of culture is found in the human mind , and the physical manifestations have meaning only in terms of these mental patterns . Ideas are the real foundation of culture . Material objects are useless without the knowledge of how to use them.29 The meanings attached to the different levels of culture are thus more important than the physical forms . The things that count are the ideas , ideals , techniques , and regularized relationships between human beings . Culture patterns are essentially mental , in that they are regular ities of behavior found among socialized human beings . In the study of prehistoric cultures , the material artifacts are the only evidence remain ing of the way of life of these long-dead societies . Hence the stone axes and other material remains are the only basis for reconstructing the culture . Group expectations do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone . They can only be inferred from the physical remains . The key to a culture , whether the society has long since vanished or is still very much alive , is to be found in the meanings and symbol-systems that alone give relevance to the physical elements . The patterns of meanings of a culture are passed on through the group and are inculcated in each individual by social interaction . Every pattern originally emerged from human beings acting in groups . Sub sequent groups conserved these expectations and invested them with social sanctions . Still other groups passed them on from one generation to the next . This process began long before man learned to write down his group norms in order to perpetuate them for posterity . The process will continue as long as man survives on the earth . Cultural expecta tions are not the exclusive property of any man or group ; they exist independently of any individual . As they exist in the mind of each member of a society , they comprise the social heritage.3 ? // QUALITIES OF CULTURE The concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social sciences to the understanding of society . It has other characteristics that make it significant . Some of them have been anticipated in the preceding discussion ; others will be discussed later in more detail . All may be brought under a single general heading.31 L The learned quality . Culture is learned behavior and is not present in the biological equipment of the human being . It includes the group expectations that the individual learns during his social conditioning . Man engages in symbolic and meaningful interaction with others in a group setting , and thereby learns the uniformities of behavior which we call culture . 2 . The transmissive quality . Culture can be transmitted from one generation to the next , and , in this sense , it is cumulative . Man can build upon the achievements of preceding generations ; he need not start anew every generation . Different aspects of culture are cumulative in different ways , with language following a different course from , for example , technology.32 In the process of transmission , the regularities of behavior assume an existence independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . In the discussion of the social group , we indicated that its members come to share certain expectations that assume a normative quality . This illustrates the social quality of culture , in that the expectations are products of group interaction . Behavior assumes a uniformity with respect to the activities pertaining to the group . Each organized group has its own culture comprising , among other things , these normative expectations.33 4 . The ideational quality . The group habits that comprise the culture come to be viewed as ideal patterns of behavior , to which the members are supposed to conform . Considerable disparity exists between the ideal and the practice , but the existence of the ideal is generally understood . This quality of culture distinguishes it from individual habits with no ideational content . 5 . The gratifying quality . Culture satisfies human wants and thus has 31 The following is adapted from George P. Murdock , " The Cross-Cultural Survey , " American Sociological Review , 5:361 ? 370 ( June , 1940 ) . 32 Harvey C. Moore , " Cumulation and Cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , 1954 ) . 33 Muzafer Sherif , " Integrating Field Work and Laboratory in Small-Group llesearch , " American Sociological Review , 19:759 ? 771 ( December , 1954 ) . // a gratifying quality . These needs may be biological , as hunger and thirst . They may also be sociocultural , as they arise through group interaction and are transmitted in the same way . For example , the need to fall in love and marry is a sociocultural product that the individual learns in our society.3 ' Just as individual habits persist only if they satisfy some conscious or unconscious individual needs , so the social habits of culture must satisfy group needs . Continued failure to do so means the eventual disappearance of a pattern of culture . The adaptive quality . Culture must also adapt to forces outside itself . The most obvious form of such adaptation involves the geograph ical environment , and people must be able to feed , clothe , and house themselves by adapting to their surroundings.3 ' This does not mean that the environment " determines " the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geographical necessities if it is to continue . Culture must also adapt to itself , in the sense that its different aspects are continually changing.36 The family must therefore adapt to the automobile and governments must adapt to the hydrogen bomb . Man lives in and through culture and he is the most adaptive of all the animals . The integrative quality . The parts of a culture tend to form a consistent whole . In Sumner 's words , there is a " strain of consistency " among the various parts of a culture.37 This integrative tendency is very apparent in a simple and isolated society , where extraneous elements are rare and the constituent elements in the culture do not change rapidly . Integration is not so apparent in a complex and heterogeneous culture , whose constituent elements are in constant change . Within wide limits , however , all cultures show such tendencies , for without a minimum of cultural integration the society would not stay together . BASIC PROBLEMS OF CULTURE Man has certain basic needs in all societies . In the effort to satisfy these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of necessary jobs must be done by people acting in culturally // prescribed ways . This universality reflects the need of all men to adjust : ( a ) to their own physical and psychological necessities ; ( b ) to the demands of the physical universe ; and ( c ) to the reciprocal demands of other persons . The exact forms of the adjustments differ from one society to another , but the general similarities remain . These similarities constitute the " common denominator of cultures . " 38 This common denominator may be explained in terms of the prin ciples of human learning . These are the same in all members of the human species and involve the following factors : Drive or impulse . This factor refers to the drives of hunger , thirst , sexual satisfaction , and other impulses that man shares with his fellow mammals . These drives are not , however , sufficient by them-selves to explain the underlying similarities in culture . Stimulus or cue . This factor refers to certain general stimuli that arise from social interaction in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dealing with the external environment , and con-trolling the actions of men in society . Habit . This factor involves " the tendency of any learned re sponse to be repeated under similar conditions of drive and stimulus . " 39 When human beings have worked out reasonably satisfactory responses to the basic drives and stimuli , they tend to repeat these responses under similar conditions . The responses ( folkways ) become incorpo rated in the culture . Limitation of potential responses . The final factor underlying the basic similarities of culture is the limitation of the potential re sponses that man can make to his various impulses and cues . Although man is the most adaptable of all the animals , his reactions ( and there-fore the number of cultural responses ) are nevertheless limited.4O All societies have certain common problems to solve . The similarities are more important than the differences . These problems have been considered under the framework of the " universal culture pattern , " a concept introduced by Clark Wissler . The elements in his universal culture pattern are : Speech , Material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Property , Government , and War.41 This concept is a convenient abstraction that makes it possible : ( a ) to grasp the func- // tional quality of culture ; ( b ) to appreciate the underlying similarities of culture ; and ( c ) to analyze various societies and their constituent cultures . The universal culture pattern has been elaborated through an enor-mous scholarly labor conducted through the years at Yale University . This project is called the Human Relations Area Files and is a cata-logue and cross-reference of the cultures of several hundred contempo-rary primitive societies , plus those of various modern nations and other societies that are no longer existent . The survey contains some sixty-nine aspects of culture , ranging from language to capital-goods in-dustries , and from entertainment to health and welfare . This list differs from Wissler 's universal culture pattern in that all societies do not have all of the elements included in the survey.42 The elements of the universal culture pattern are not identical in structure , even though they perform the same general functions . There are many forms of family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family is one of the " universals " in the universal culture pattern . The latter is , in effect , a system of classification that reflects the fact that all cultures have elements in common . Murdock says : 43 The true universals of culture . . . are not identities in habit , in definable behavior . They are similarities in classification , not in content . They repre-sent categories of historically and behavioristically diverse elements which nevertheless have so much in common that competent observers feel com-pelled to classify them together . VARIABILITY OF CULTURE A final general characteristic of culture is its variability ; there are several possible solutions for every basic human need . The universal culture pattern is an abstraction that reflects the similarity of the needs . We may now indicate some of the factors that give rise to the different ways in which these needs are met . These differences have always impressed people more than the similarities . Human beings have traditionally regarded members of other societies as slightly outlandish or sinister characters , wearing funny clothes , speaking incomprehensible gibberish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // It has sometimes seemed scarcely possible that these curious creatures could be human beings . Geographical environment . Conditions in the frigid arctic neces sarily differ from those in the tropics or the temperate zone , and the culture of the Eskimo is ingeniously adapted to the arctic environment . Similarly , the dugout canoes and scanty clothing of the Amazonian jungle peoples answer the survival problems of that area very well . The environment limits the technical solutions to survival , notably in the field of subsistence . As one anthropologist puts it , " The primary point of interaction between a culture and its environment is in terms of subsistence , and the most vital aspect of environment from the point of view of culture is its suitability for food production . " 44 The geographical environment offers possibilities for survival that a given society either accepts or rejects , depending upon its particular stage of development . New York Harbor served merely as a handy place to gather shellfish for the Indians of pre-Columbian days . Its great function as a funnel into the New World had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of employing its advantages . The mucky black liquid and crumbly stone of the Alleghenies meant noth ing to the Indians , until culture developed to the stage when first coal and then petroleum became vital aspects of the emergent Industrial Revolution . The geographical environment has an important condition ing effect upon the economic aspects of societies . Technological development . The stage of technology of a culture has a decided effect upon the way of life of the society.45 The basic element in technology is knowledge . Technological advancement has an immediate impact upon the economic system , and this in turn affects the other parts of the culture . The massive changes in the way of life of the people of western Europe and America with the Industrial Revolution are a striking example of the relationship of technology to the structure of society . The differences in the forms taken by various cultures are a partial function of the state of technological advance ment.46 More specific relationships between technology and cultural diversity are readily at hand . In the past fifty years , contraceptives have changed the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about // a distinctive pattern in American society different from that of any other . Societies are " primitive " largely because of the rudimentary state of their technological development . As the world draws together , many local variations of culture are beginning to even out under the pervasive influence of machine technology . This process liberates man from much of the back-breaking toil that has been his since the dawn of history . It also destroys the sociocultural structures erected upon a simpler technology . " Cultural drift . The general drift of the culture of the Australian Arunta is toward ritualistic and ceremonial behavior . They spend most of their time in endless festivals , made up of elaborate dances , chants , and other mysterious ceremonies.48 In our own country , the emphasis is upon material rather than ceremonial forms of behavior . Our energies are mobilized toward material achievement , and the rewards of our society are extended to the person who reaches these goals . We reward our technical inventors with money and prestige . The social inventor of a new religion , family system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The general drift of the culture thus determines many of its charac teristics.49 A culture that has started in a particular direction will tend to continue in the same direction and produce changes consistent with this pattern . In the Soviet Union , there is much that is reminiscent of the old czarist authoritarianism . The carelessness toward human life that characterizes the present regime had deep roots in a society that did not free the serfs until 1863 . Forms of culture acquire their own mo mentum . Despite surface changes , many of these underlying elements remain and set the course for new cultural developments . Cultures differ because they start in different directions and their momentum carries them on . Historical accident . A final factor in cultural variability is chance or historical accident . A seemingly unimportant event may have in-calculable effects upon the subsequent development of a society . Some persons call these occurrences luck , whereas others attribute them to divine providence . Whatever the ultimate cause , chance plays an im portant role in cultural variability . If France had not been defeated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the control of the British India Company and subsequently under the British Empire . The whole subsequent history and culture of the vast Indian subcon tinent would then have been different . Significant elements in the culture of hundreds of millions of persons thus grew out of a " chance " defeat in battle . The introduction of a new cultural element or group of elements can also change the outlines of a culture . The impact of Mohammedanism upon the native cultures of North Africa , the introduction of the horse into the culture of the Plains Indians , and the rapid intrusion of the industrial technology of the Western World upon " backward " societies around the globe are examples . These events seem to occur without plan or design , unless one maintains that everything in the world hap-pens according to a preordained design . The fact of cultural variability is clear.5O As a result of these and other causal factors , each society evolves a different culture , composed of different elements . The emphasis placed upon these elements is even more variable . In each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The basic energies of one society are directed toward the acquisition of material goods ; the energies of other societies fall into religious , artistic , or recreational channels . In one society , the people are vitally concerned with money ; in another , the role of money , or any medium of exchange , is mini mized . The goals of one society are very different from another . Out of all the possible elements , each separate society stresses its own values.51 The diversity of cultures is thusythe product of a process of selection of the elements a society considers valuable and those it considers un important . Among the possible elements a society may select are : 52 . . . the schemes of ownership , with the social hierarchy that may be associated with possessions ; there are material things and their elaborate technology ; there are all the facets of sex life , parenthood and post-parent hood ; there are the guilds or cults which may give structure to the society ; there is economic exchange ; there are the gods and supernatural sanctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all the possible elements that may concern man in all societies . Each society erects its basic institutions about certain elements , often to the virtual neglect of // others . Elements that seem important to us ( money , material posses sions , and technological advancement ) may be of negligible importance to other societies with other expectations . Human energy has limits ; a given society can not be equally interested in all the possible aspects of culture . Societies that scorn the technological aspects of culture may spend their energies upon ceremonial observances and puberty rites . One society contemplates its shiny new automobiles ; another looks with equal enthusiasm upon its religious ceremonies . Man is one , but cul tures are many.53 // THE NATURE OF CULTURE PATTERNS Culture is a complex whole , the uniquely human product of social interaction . It has both material and nonmaterial forms , but its most characteristic aspects exist in symbolic form in the human mind . These common intellectual elements mean that the behavior of the members of a society assumes certain regularities , in thought as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , arranged in regular systems of ordered behavior that channel human activities . Culture patterning refers to " the relation of units in a determinate system , the interrelation of parts as dominated by the general character of wholes. " 1 135 // The simplest element in culture is the trait . A culture is composed of thousands of individual traits , each the result of human activity . Culture traits may be either material or nonmaterial . A nail or a shoe string is a material trait ; a religious gesture is a nonmaterial trait . The latter includes folkways , mores , and other normative sanctions , as well as the great amorphous group of undefined acts . The dividing line be tween the two in practice is largely one of perspective . Both reflect the regularity of behavior . Material traits have some custom , technique , or behavior sequence related to them . Man can not live by material traits alone . Neither can he live without them . Culture traits are rarely found in isolation . They ordinarily combine I with other related traits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in relationship to other traits and to their combination . Each trait bears a functional relationship to the others and can be understood only in this relationship . This group of functionally related traits is known as a culture pattern or configura tion . The pattern , not the individual trait , is the basic functional unit of culture . The individual seldom learns individual or isolated traits , but rather learns the practices and expectations of his culture in the form of patterns . Patterns are learned as units and not piecemeal in terms of their constituent parts.2 i The concept of the culture pattern provides a basic insight into the reasons why group behavior is ordered and regular . Without the tend ency to form patterns , regularity in social behavior would be impossi ble . Individuals would react in random and haphazard fashion to their biological and visceral drives , and ordered society could never arise . The individual components of culture , whether material or nonmate rial , however , are not sufficient in themselves to explain the regularity of social behavior . Human behavior is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learned ) as each generation acquires the group ways of life . The concept of individual habit alone is not sufficient to account for this regularity . Clusters of group habits ( that is , culture patterns ) are the basic elements in organized society . In the process of socialization , the individual learns the appropriate culture patterns involving such varied behavior as eating breakfast , going to school , playing football , having a date , and getting married . Each society and , to a certain extent , each class has its own set of patterns which it imposes upon the individual and thus assures , within // limits , a minimum uniformity of behavior . The sanctions that form the moral basis of these patterns are the folkways , mores , and other norma tive expectations . When the members of a group are following the same basic expectations , a degree of uniformity and predictability is observable in their behavior . They are , in other words , following the same culture pattern . The culture pattern therefore denotes regularity of behavior . It im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion is recurrent in a given group , and hence that this particular behavior is suggested , guided , or regulated by the group.3 Culture patterns imply behavior that may be either " physical " or " mental . " Many of the readers of this book have actively participated in the patterned behavior of teen-age culture . This culture has national manifestations , transmitted through the mass media of radio , television , motion pictures , and magazines . It also has local manifestations in each high-school clique , with its own specialized vocabulary , dress , and expectations . In culturally patterned behavior , both the physical behavior and the related motivation emerge from group activity and take on a degree of uniformity from this fact . ' As an example of a familiar culture pattern , we may take the game of baseball . In the hundred years since its " invention , " baseball has accumulated a stock of patterned behavior that has become part of the heritage of every American boy . Formal and informal rules form the basis of this pattern . The huge physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its coaching and scouting systems , and its valuable players are material manifestations of this pattern . Publicity is also part of the process by which interest is maintained during the long playing season and even more during the months of winter hibernation . The final and indispensable element in the baseball pattern is the millions of devoted fans who support their team through thick and thin . They flock joyfully to the park when they have the time and the resources , and there munch peanuts and revile the umpire at their pleasure . These and many other elements comprise the culture attern of baseball ' // THE STUDY OF CULTURE PATTERNS Culture patterns are intangible and exist only in the minds and habits of human beings . The person who enters another society ? whether primitive or advanced ? for the purpose of studying its culture can not experience the patterns with his senses . All he can see is human behavior , occurring in more or less regular fashion . In final analysis , culture is an abstraction from observed and regularized behavior . This statement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general . Human beings engage in behavior that , upon continued ob servation , is found to have regularity . This regularity is the pattern . The sociologist or cultural anthropologist is chiefly concerned with patterns rather than with the individuals who carry them out.6 A foreign observer who attended a high school dance in the United States would be at a loss to explain much of the behavior of the teen-age participants . At first glance , our observer might assume that the actions were highly spontaneous , individualistic , and ( perhaps ) some-what abandoned . On closer observation , however , the dancing , the conversation , and the hand-holding follow strict regularities . Boys and girls who were acting spontaneously could never reach such uniformi ties of behavior all by themselves . As he became increasingly familiar with teen-age culture , our hypothetical observer would begin to realize that this behavior , at first seemingly so individualistic , was in reality as stylized as a primitive fertility rite . These adolescents dress , speak , dance , and think in accordance with uniform cultural pressures . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he becomes aware that he is seeing a culture pattern in action. ? The existence of a culture pattern means that certain uniformities in behavior exist in a given society at a given time . These uniformities are limited in time and space . Many of those currently observed in our society were not present a generation ago nor will be present a genera tion hence . Limitations are equally apparent in terms of space . Some of the patterns of our society are not found among other societies , whether primitive or advanced . As we have seen , certain broad cultural uniformities do exist between societies , insofar as all of them have some form of language , government , family system , and economic or ganization.8 But the specific forms that evolve to meet these and other // needs are subject to wide variation . The regularities of behavior that constitute culture patterns exist in individual societies . The evolution of the culture pattern is thus from " facts to patterns . " The observer first notes the occurrence of many acts by the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observer becomes increasingly aware of regularities of behavior in a variety of fields , from toilet-training to technology . When a number of such acts take the same form , he may make a tentative generalization concerning the behavior in question . The generalization regarding , say , the ceremonies attending the passage from childhood to maturity , describes the pattern . The motivations that cause the individual to engage in such behavior exist in his conscious and unconscious mental processes , where they have been implanted by the learning process . The pattern formed by many such individual acts exists , in final analysis , in the mind of the observer.9 We have spoken as if culture patterns consisted solely of inferences drawn from physical acts . In practice , this constitutes only one category of patterned behavior . There are at least three distinct , although clearly related , aspects of such behavior. ( 1 ) Physical behavior . This category includes all of the physical actions of the members of a given society that assume socially prescribed regularity . The many forms of daily activity , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under this heading . ( 2 ) Verbal behavior . Language is a second form of patterned behavior . The group assigns meanings to symbols and instructs its members in the relationships between them . Language is patterned behavior in the most literal sense . , ( 3 ) Material artifacts . Many of the material objects in a society are the products or appendages of culture patterns . The presence of money or any other exchange symbol of value may thus indicate the existence of a complex economic pattern ; 10 charred bones in a prehistoric campsite are evidence of the pattern of roasting meat . In recent thinking , there has been a growing tendency to exclude material objects themselves from the concept of culture pattern and to include what Linton // calls the " patterns for objects . " 11 These patterns are inferences drawn from material objects . Culture patterns may also be viewed in functional terms , that is , in terms of their function in group life . Many patterns have such obvious functions as earning a living , raising the young , and communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear objectives . Unconscious motivations may cause the members of a group to follow a particular pattern . The patterned behavior of dating in our society may have the function of finding a mate and thereby founding a family . At another level , however , the function of dating may be to enhance the psychological satisfactions of both parties . The man and woman may be seeking to satisfy in marriage certain emotional needs , of whose existence they may be only dimly aware . These needs may be comple mentary , in that a woman who unconsciously wishes to be dominated seeks a man who will satisfy this need.12 This function is a far cry from the conscious desire to marry and have children . The courtship pattern performs the function , after a fashion , of fulfilling both types of satis factions . Culture patterns vary with respect to the degree of standardization and the social media involved in the learning process . In a primitive society , regularity of behavior results from word-of-mouth learning and example , whereby the child learns the expected ways of thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the example of his elders , and he learns the basic patterns of the group by observa tion , conscious training , and unconscious imitation . The elementary patterns of the culture are present in the behavior of persons in his immediate environment . Under such conditions , the learning process is simple , direct , and strong . The raw material of personality is there for all to see.13 In a large and amorphous society such as our own , regularity of behavior is also the result of mass media of communication , in addition to the more intimate efforts of the primary group . Radio , television , the comics , and the movies are among the media that play an important part in cultural patterning . Many of the behavior patterns of the ado lescent generation directly reflect the mass media . The adolescent peer // group assumes many of its attitudes and behavior patterns from these forms of communication . The adolescent learns how to dress , talk , dance , and amuse himself from these sources.l ' As localized patterns have broken down , culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass communication.15 LEVELS OF CULTURE PATTERNS The forms of regularized behavior known as culture patterns have different levels of universality , valid , and compulsion . Some patterns are virtually universal within a given society , and practically every member engages in behavior more or less closely related to the same central value . The majority of Americans , for example , act within the framework of the capitalistic system and follow its patterns . Their behavior has the general function of making enough money to support themselves in varying degrees of comfort and affluence . Americans like-wise use the English language as a common basis of communication , although their language efficiency reflects such factors as social class , ethnic group , and region . In our society , the English language , the capitalistic ethic , and the Christian religion are " universal " patterns of culture . " Other culture patterns are restricted to different sexes , age groups , occupational groups , social classes , castes , and religious groups within a society . In contrast to the universals , these restricted patterns are called " specialties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sexes , with the men following certain patterns of learned behavior and the women others . This division of labor is most clearly evident in the patterns related to the bearing and rearing of children . In this process , it has been said that the woman 's biology is her destiny . In making and consuming material goods and services , the specialties are equally apparent between the sexes , even though men and women do not have the same specialties in all societies as in our own . ' In a more subtle sense , the emotional and temperamental characteristics of the sexes may also be socially defined and thus reflect patterns of cul142 CULTURE PATTERNS ture . The nature of " masculinity " and " femininity " is not irrevocably fixed in the germ plasm , but differs from one society to another . Women are expected to be " masculine " and aggressive in some societies , and men are trained to be " feminine " and retiring.18 A third level of culture patterns comprises what Linton has called alternatives . By this term , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to similar situations within the same society . The psychological need to worship the supernatural forces is strong in all societies , but the forms of this worship vary . A variety of alternative methods of worshiping the higher powers is thus apparent in our own society , with each of the various denominations and sects providing socially acceptable patterns . In a very different field , alternative methods of transportation are available to the individual , who may go by automobile , train , or air-plane . In education , the teacher may choose from among the recitation , discussion , or lecture methods , not to mention the use of motion pic tures , radio , or television as instructional devices . Within limits , the individual may choose between alternative culture patterns in a variety of other activities . Each alternative offers a socially accepted means to the desired end.19 In the study of a complex culture , it is important to recognize the existence of universals , specialties , and alternatives . Certain broad sim ilarities in patterned behavior are clearly universals , in the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The specialties are like-wise comparatively apparent , and their nature can be readily grasped . When we come to alternatives , however , the analysis becomes more complicated , inasmuch as many persons are unaware of these differ ences . A certain degree of intellectual sophistication is necessary to understand that differences exist within the same society with regard to such culture patterns as , say , child-training 20 or sex relations.21 These and other alternatives represent the methods followed in different sub-cultures for arriving at the same ends . Societies differ in the comparative importance of universals , special-ties , and alternatives . In general , a primitive society has a compara tively large number of universals and specialties and a comparatively // small number of alternatives . The culture patterns in such a society are generally accepted and there is little or no significant departure from these universals . The alternatives are likewise limited in a simple culture and the average individual has little or no choice in such mat ters as religious worship , vocational activity , and marital status . The member of the folk society is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his status largely depends upon the success with which he conforms to these established patterns . The folk society is usually ? a small , isolated , tightly knit , conservative , and integrated social sys tem , in which the universals and specialties bulk large in the total culture.22 The culture of the United States is marked by a high proportion of alternative patterns . There are not one but many ways of making a living , raising the young , and communicating with the higher powers . Each of these ways is an acceptable means to the approved end . The individual has only to choose , if the choice has not already been made for him by his status in a class or subculture . In a dynamic society , the alternatives constantly overshadow the universals and the special-ties . The members of our society have fewer patterns in common than do members of many other societies . Larger segments of our society are open to choice . In such a fluid society , the core of common elements grows pro progressively smaller , and members find cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be predicted on the basis of the universals and the specialties . Such prediction has fewer common patterns upon which to rely in our society . Concerted group action is therefore handicapped . As a result of these trends , Linton suggests that " We are rapidly approaching the point where there will no longer be enough items on which all members of the society agree to provide the culture with form and pattern . " 23 IDEAL AND REAL PATTERNS In the analysis of culture patterns , the relationship between the " real " and the " ideal " must be constantly borne in mind . In the first place , there is the " real " behavior , such as brushing one 's teeth and playing football , that may be actually observed and verified by // two or more persons . In the second place , there is the conception held by the members concerning the way the group behaves under similar circumstances . Finally , there is the way in which people think they ought to behave , which may be very different from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important clue to a culture.24 Both the ideal and the real patterns are abstractions from physical behavior . The persons actually performing the patterned activity are ? seldom conscious of its cultural source . As the student follows the rou tine of daily existence ? eating breakfast , going to class , studying , par ticipating in athletics , dating , and the rest ? he is unaware that he is engaging in behavior that is highly patterned by his culture . The nature of these patterns can only be grasped when he stands aside and views his behavior objectively . He sees people behaving in various ways that assume a regularity as he observes them more closely . In this sense , the " real " patterns are seen in the form of people doing certain things . The " ideal " patterns represent another level of abstraction . They are found not in what people actually do but in what they think they ought to do . In comparatively static societies , the difference between the real and the ideal is slight . Men and women do approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works in the fields , hunts , fishes , makes war , performs religious ceremonials , or engages in other mascu line activities prescribed by the culture . The wife similarly does the things women are expected to do.25 The agreement between the ideal and the real is very great . In our own society , the agreement between the way people act and the way they are supposed to act is less pronounced . The reason for this disparity is that the " real " patterns ( the way people actually be-have ) change much more rapidly than the " ideal " patterns ( the way they are supposed to behave ) . When the social setting is changing rapidly , the individual must adapt , whether he likes it or not . When technological innovations revolutionize the ways of life , women work in offices or factories despite the fact that the ideal pattern has always decreed that the woman 's place is in the home . Ideal behavior is thus more " conservative " than real behavior . In the case of the gainful em employment of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real patterns , as the acceptance of this new role becomes more // widespread . Even so , many persons bewail the changing times and hint darkly that women are losing their precious female birthright.26 The ideal patterns originate in real behavior , in that they tend to approximate behavior that once actually existed . The ideal patterns for husbands and wives originated in a simple , agrarian society , where the family performed most of the basic social functions and the patterns for the sexes were widely understood . This way of life persisted during most of the historical development of western European society , and these patterns accordingly became firmly fixed in the culture . The changes in the way of life since the Industrial Revolution have necessi-tated corresponding adaptations in behavior . The ideal patterns have therefore lagged behind the real.27 Ideal patterns have a life of their own that is independent of the actual behavior of any individual or group . " As systems of ideas , " says Linton , " they the ideal patterns become a part of the culture of the group and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as imitation . " 28 The ideal patterns are thus models of behavior that the child is encouraged to follow by precept and parental example . As he becomes an adult , he may or may not live up to the ideal patterns of his culture . The mere fact that they are there , however , is important in the direction of real behavior . The ideal pat-terns motivate the person to achieve the behavior incorporated in these models and handed down in the cultural heritage . The Ten Command-ments have not always been followed during the more than two thou-sand years since they were revealed as ideal patterns to Moses on Mount Sinai . Their role in the determination of real patterns of be-havior , however , can not be denied . In the various parts that the individual plays during his lifetime , the ideal patterns of his culture are always before him . As a child , he learns how a child is supposed to act , and at the same time he learns the adult patterns of his society . The ideal patterns of filial conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live up to them . The pattern of the good husband nevertheless becomes a part of his per-sonality and conditions his behavior in the marital situation . His self-feeling reflects the degree to which he thinks he has fulfilled the ideal of the good husband . As he himself becomes a father , he tries to be a // good father , as that concept is embodied in the ideal pattern of father-hood . In these and many other situations where patterned behavior is expected , the model of the ideal pattern continues to exert its in fluence.29 This ideal quality of the pattern illustrates the " superorganic " aspect of culture . The actual physical behavior comprising the real pattern between husband and wife ceases with death or divorce . But the ideal pattern marking the way a married couple should act continues through many generations . In this process of transmission , even the ideal pat-terns are subject to change , but changes on this level are slower than on the " real " level . In this connection , Linton points out that " the pat-terns behave like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and persisting while individuals come and go . " NATIONAL PATTERNS OF CULTURE The largest functional unit in our analysis is the national pat-tern of culture . This is an intricate mosaic of all the individual patterns , held together by a few over-all patterns that are accepted , in approx imately the same form , by the members of the society . We are familiar with the modern nation as a cultural unit , as American culture is dis tinguished from French , German , Italian , or Swedish culture . In some cases , the nation transcends cultural boundaries , for such units as the Soviet Union , India , and China contain many widely different cultures , held together by more or less rigorous administrative ties.31 In general , however , national states and national culture patterns are roughly co terminous , at least in those administrative areas that comprise western European civilization . The existence of large patterns of culture has long been empirically accepted . In ancient times , the Egyptians , Greeks , and Romans acted upon the assumption that the various societies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had certain broad characteristics that set them off from others.32 In more recent times , the common-sense belief // in the existence of cultural differences between national states has be-come an important part of the folk heritage . The intuitive acceptance of these differences , indeed , constitutes the principal basis for ethno centrism , as Americans , Frenchmen , Germans , and ( more recently ) Chinese , Indonesians , Burmese , and Egyptians are convinced that their own culture is superior to that of any other established or emerging national pattern . The realization of this situation has stimulated many studies in this general field , with the ultimate purpose of eliminating , or at least mitigating , the cultural tensions that lead to war.33 It is one thing to sense these broad cultural differences between na tional states . It is quite another to demonstrate the nature of these differences and reduce them to workable terms . Among the difficulties in delimiting national culture patterns are : ( a ) the fact , as noted , that some nations include a number of different culture patterns ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as divergent as the Polish and Mongolian ; ( b ) the fact that culture patterns change , so that the national pattern of a country like Japan was not the same in the pre-industrial nineteenth-century period as it is today ; ( c ) the fact that nations contain many subcultures ( for example , social classes ) that often make it difficult to distinguish the universal cultural elements , if any ; ( d ) the fact that the policy makers who administer a nation may act in ways that are not those of the rank and file members of the society ; ( e ) the fact that certain cultural products ( for example , liter ature and art ) are produced by a small and presumably atypical seg ment of the population and hence may not be representative of the broad , underlying pattern of the common people.34 The scientific ( as distinguished from the impressionistic ) study of cultures as more or less self-contained units began with the anthropolo gists , who have investigated hundreds of such comparatively small and integrated societies . Many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Abram Kardiner , an anthropologist and a psychoanalyst , respectively . They have combined these two disci plines , plus the insights and methods of several others , in an effort to demonstrate : ( a ) the existence of broad cultural uniformities within each society ; and ( b ) the impact of these uniformities upon personal ity . In these studies , they emphasized early childhood experience , espe cially in such matters as feeding , toilet-training , weaning , and the like . They also made use of the various projective techniques in the reper148 CULTURE PATTERNS toire of the clinical psychologist , such as the Rorschach and Thematic Apperception Tests , with their accompanying insights into the structure of the personality.35 The paramount fact that emerges from these and other anthropo logical studies is that culture patterns actually do differ from one soci ety to another . Summarizing these general conclusions , Linton suggests that : 36 The existence of different personality norms for the members of different small , culturally homogeneous societies seems to be well established . Ob jective techniques for the study and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work leading to these results has been done almost exclusively on the so-called primitive societies , it seems highly probable that the same techniques can be applied to the study of culturally homo geneous societies within modern nations . Hence the theoretical basis for postulating national patterns of culture would seem to be empirically established . The psychocultural techniques developed by the anthropologists have also been employed in the study of national patterns of culture . The composition and dimensions of the patterns are , as it were , inferred from the personality structures of the ( presumably ) typical members of the society . More specifically , personality is studied not only in terms of biologically inherited factors but also in terms of " the intra-personal representation of the culturally and socially transmitted mechanisms for regulating , distributing , and controlling the tensions of these innate need-systems. " 37 A number of national patterns of culture have been subjected to various general hypotheses concerning the relationships between the organization of systems of biological needs and the resultant configura tions of personality . La Barre has made extensive observations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has // likewise studied the national pattern of the Japanese , a work inspired by the urgent military desire to understand the culture of one of our principal enemies in World War II.39 Some of the culture patterns of eastern Europe have also been examined in terms of their expression in personality , with particular emphasis upon the techniques of child-rearing . Certain personality traits of Polish and Russian children ( and later adults ) are thus said to reflect the methods of swaddling em ployed in these two cultures by the peasant family.40 The culture pattern of the Soviet Union has been the subject of various exploratory studies , using these and other psychocultural tech niques . An intensive study was made of a small sample ( twenty-nine persons ) of men and women who had recently left the orbit of Soviet power . Various regularities were discovered in the behavior of these persons , reflecting goal or value orientations , both those of the " official " society and the " unofficial " culture . Other aspects of the culture pat-tern were inferred from the relations between the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , both in theory and practice.41 A third general aspect of the Soviet culture pattern tentatively ex plored in this study comprised the need-systems and their regulation , that is , the socially approved ways in which needs for eating , drinking , and sexual release were satisfied . Closely related to these needs were the patterns of frustration , aggression , guilt , and similar emotions , pre sumably reflecting the ways in which these needs were regulated . A final element in the culture pattern involved the social or group needs of the individual , including those for affection , emotional security , recognition , achievement , and the like.42 MEASUREMENT OF NATIONAL PATTERNS When we come to measure the culture patterns of modern states , many conceptual and methodological difficulties arise . The vari ous elements in these patterns are not fully consistent . Contradictory patterns that make contradictory claims upon the members of the so ciety are present . Primitive cultures tend to have greater internal unity // and consistency than modern cultures . The elements in the primitive pattern ordinarily change slowly , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many contradictions and inconsistencies within a given culture , however , agreement on certain basic elements gives it a working unity . The measurement of modern national patterns has been approached ( a ) in terms of constituent individual patterns , and ( b ) in terms of the pattern as a whole . Among the individual elements cited to demonstrate the validity of national patterns are : ( a ) vital statis tics dealing with such problem situations as mental disease , di vorce , suicide , and crime ; ( b ) forms of family life and the different patterns of family authority ; 43 ( c ) the differential incidence of psy chosomatic disorders that are presumably influenced by cultural fac tors , such as high blood pressure , gastric ulcer , and the like ; ( d ) content analyses of cultural products , including movies , drama , litera ture , and the mass culture ; ( e ) community studies , in which represen tative communities in different societies are studied and compared ; ( f ) public opinion surveys , in which verbalized attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g ) psychological testing , involving such approaches as intelligence tests , performance tests , and various projective techniques.44 The most ambitious attempt to delimit national patterns of culture as wholes has been made by the psychologist Raymond B. Cattell . In his work , he has sought to establish some system of measurement of national characteristics as units . He is primarily concerned with the behavior of the group ( for example , the nation ) as an entity and with the variables in the culture pattern that are related to this behavior . In this connection , he speaks of the " syntality " of the nation ? the char acteristics of the pattern when the nation is acting as a group . This concept of syntality in the nation is somewhat similar to the concept of personality in the individual.45 In his comparative study of national culture patterns , Cattell employs // three over-all classifications : ( a ) population variables ? these include the size of the population , the age variations , birth and death rates , and similar elements that can be quantitatively determined ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between individuals in the society , as embodied in the class structure and illustrated in personality differences between the various classes ; and ( c ) syntality characters ? these include , as noted , the characteristics of the nation while acting as a group , such as aggressiveness , support of the arts and sciences , and degree of control over the individual . These traits are somewhat similar to the aspect of a society which Kroeber calls its " style , " with emphasis upon the group activities that are expressly creative.4G Syn tality characteristics are inferred from the collective behavior of the nation in much the same way that personality is inferred from the total behavior of the individual . " Cattell first gathered statistical data on sixty-nine different nations ( later reduced to forty ) . Some eighty variables were correlated under twelve general headings ( dimensions ) , each representing a number of characteristics of the national pattern . Examples of these dimensions are : ( a ) enlightened affluence versus narrow poverty ; ( b ) vigorous order versus unadapted rigidity ; and ( c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy ) expression . On the basis of the twelve dimensions , Cattell established a profile for each nation that corresponds roughly to the national pattern of culture . Each nation has a unique profile or pattern , although these profiles show pronounced similarities between groups of countries , characterized by Cattell as " families . " The reasons why each nation develops a unique profile ( pattern ) are briefly suggested . Cattell thinks that the patterns reflect such factors as " common historical diffusion from a center , common historical trauma , common racial composition , common language , com mon geographical environment , and common religion . " 48 These methods have been applied , on a more modest scale , to cul ture patterns in the United States , notably those of the forty-eight states , rather than to the United States as a whole.49 In this study , the // author applied sixteen cultural variables to the patterns of the several states . These variables tend to emphasize educational status , although they include other factors . Among them are the following statistical indices : population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white households ; birth rate ; death rate ; per cent of pupils ; per cent of employees ; per capita income ; expenditures per pupil ; teachers ' sal-aries ; number of pupils per teacher ; number of pupils in secondary schools per 100 pupils in elementary schools ; median number of years of school completed for persons twenty-five years of age and older in the white population ; ratio of Negro to white population in terms of number of years of schooling completed ; number of persons sixteen to twenty years old attending school per 100 persons of the same age group ; and the number of cases of larceny and theft known to the police . ' ? Three principal groups of variables emerge from this comparative study of the culture patterns of the forty-eight states : The first of these factors is called " Urban Comfort versus Rural Poverty " and involves such positive variables as percentage of urban population , per capita income , and average teachers ' salaries . On the negative side , this factor includes low birth rate and low percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " Emphasis on Education " and is posi-tively associated with a high rate of persons attending school in the age group sixteen to twenty years , a high rate of school years com-pleted by white persons twenty-five years of age and older , and high average yearly expenditures per pupil.51 The third factor is called " Absence of Racial Discrimination " and deals with the " American Dilemma " of racial inequality . Positively associated with this factor ( that is , the absence of racial discrimina-tion ) are such variables as high ratio of school years completed by Negroes to school years completed by whites , high percentage of white households , and many teachers per 100 pupils in elementary schools . Negatively associated with this factor , and hence positively associated with absence of racial discrimination , is the small number of persons belonging to the minority group . The greatest amount of discrimina-tion , in short , is found in the states with the largest proportion of Negroes.52 // THE AMERICAN CULTURE PATTERN In a famous passage , cited in the previous chapter , Ruth Ben-edict characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She says , 53 The cultural pattern of any civilization makes use of a certain segment of the great arc of potential human purposes and motivations , just as . . . any culture makes use of certain selected material techniques or cultural traits . The great arc . . . is far too immense and too full of contradictions for any one culture to utilize even any considerable portion of it . Each society stresses certain patterns , sometimes to the virtual exclu sion of others . Broad similarities exist between cultures , but each one is unique . The American culture pattern therefore comprises the elements that Americans have selected out of the " great arc of potential human pur poses . " This is the combination of cultural factors that makes America like no other society . The American pattern is not necessarily more desirable or more conducive to human welfare than any other . It is merely different . It stresses different values.54 Out of all the possible combinations of culture patterns , this society has selected certain ones to emphasize and others to neglect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are a part of us . The traditional source of information in this field has come from the descriptions of travelers . The informal study of the American culture pattern conducted some 125 years ago by Alexis de Tocqueville re-mains one of the classic analyses by a foreign observer . " In the brief history of this country as an independent nation , it is estimated that several thousand persons , with varying degrees of sympathy , under-standing , and insight , have observed American culture and generalized in writing upon it.56 The description of American culture has also occupied Americans.57 We can not consider all of these efforts here , although , in a sense , much // of the subsequent description and analysis in this book deals with this general subject . We may merely indicate some of the broad elements that have emerged from the interaction of American society . The char acteristics of American culture are the result of the selectivity of this society . In our analysis , we shall follow the lines set down by Robert S. Lynd , 55 whose researches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elusive field.59 The American pattern is casual . The patterning of any culture is , by the nature of the cultural process itself , essentially unplanned . The American pattern is more casual than most , and the very concept of planning is anathema to many persons . The Puritan heritage , the fron tier spirit , and the capitalistic ethic are among the factors that have stressed the individualism of the culture and the belief that a minimum of central authority is desirable . The American pattern is uneven . As Ruth Benedict points out , every society stresses some patterns of culture more than others . Amer ican culture devotes a great deal of attention to making a living and the acquisition of property . In this emphasis , it shows a comparative neglect of such patterns as religion , art , welfare , and large kinship groups . 3 . The American pattern is unequal . American culture is also marked by what Lynd has called " extreme differences in power . " This power varies between individuals , corporations , voluntary associations , and other social units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourag ing the competition that leads to monopolistic concentrations of power , and ( b ) discouraging such concentrations through antitrust legislation . 4 . The American pattern is mobile . American culture is based upon a ? high degree of mobility . This mobility is of two related types : ( a ) horizontal ? where the individual moves frequently from place to place ; ( b ) vertical ? where the individual moves up or down in the social scale . These aspects of mobility are interrelated , since physical movement often accompanies efforts to rise in the social scale . Busi ness executives who reach positions of authority are highly mobile , for they must be ready to move when the opportunity for a better job comes along. ? ? // 5 . The American pattern is urban . A basic trend in American society has been the movement from the farm to the city and from there to the metropolitan area . More than 95 million persons in the United States now live in the 168 standard metropolitan areas , and the way of life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Culture patterns are increasingly urban patterns , as the influence of the city extends even to the minority still living on farms.62 6 . The American pattern is oriented toward the future . A strong tendency of the Protestant ethic is the postponement of present satis factions for the sake of future satisfactions . The most obvious form of this behavior is to save money ? to refrain from enjoying present satis factions in order to enjoy those that will presumably come later.U3 In a broader sense , Americans have always believed in the perfectibility of man , the improvement of society , and the increase in material comfort in the future.64 The American pattern is youth-centered . It has often been said that America is a young man 's country . This has been true in both a literal and a figurative sense . The age level of the population has been considerably lower than in most European countries , partially because of the high birth rate and partially because of the large numbers of young adults who came to this country from abroad . In the figurative sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a large and undeveloped continent , open for exploitation by the young , the hardy , and the daring . The cult of youth has remained in different aspects of the culture pattern ; both men and women strive to remain young and regard old age as the time when life is essentially over . The American pattern is increasingly a mass pattern . The mass culture refers to certain common patterns of belief and behavior that are held by most persons in all walks of life in our society . The mass culture is originated and transmitted through mass communications media that can make a comic strip character into a folk hero and a radio crooner into everybody 's sweetheart . The mass culture is by its very nature more ephemeral than those patterns at the heart of the society that are centered about the family , church , and state . // In this chapter , we have examined the tendency of culture to form patterns . In every society , there are consistent forms of response to a variety of recurrent situations ? from eating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patterns and are actually abstractions from behavior . Culture patterns differ in their application to all members of a society or to certain members under specified con ditions . They also differ in terms of the ways people actually behave or are merely supposed to behave . The largest functional unit is the national pattern of culture , whose qualities we have observed both in theory and in the form it has taken in the United States . // // AND THE GROUP PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION Culture is the fund of patterned and shared experience established and perpetuated by social interaction . It comprises the collective aspects of personality in a society . In his social development , the individual comes in contact with many different groups . These groups are the bearers of culture ; the individual acquires most of his patterned behavior from them . He engages in social interaction with these persons and , by taking them into account in their relationships toward himself , slowly acquires his personality . In our society , the learning situation involves first the family , then the peer group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other formal agencies . Each of these groups is a minia-t L ure society , and the child learns different aspects of culture from them . Personality is the third major element in our analysis . Our first con-158 // tern was with society , with particular emphasis upon the group aspects of this process . We then examined culture as the product of this inter-action and observed the patterned form that culture takes . We turn now to the individual and the personality that he acquires in his social and cultural setting . These three major concepts are so interrelated that they can be separated only in theory , not in practice.l Each per-son incorporates into his personality the culture patterns that he has learned from his interaction in various groups . Indeed , personality has been called the subjective aspect of culture . ' Social interaction is crucial to the formation of personality in another sense . The most intimate and " personal " aspect of the personality is the self , the entity that sets each individual off from every other indi vidual . This uniquely personal thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of group settings . We acquire our attitudes toward ourselves largely through the attitudes of others toward us . We are modest , vain , confident , or timid largely because of the attitudes that we think others have toward us . This conception of the self is the core of the personality . We can not form this conception by ourselves , but must learn it from others . In this sense , complete personal individuality has been called an " illusion , " inasmuch as the self can not be isolated from the others . ' The human being has an hereditary equipment that enables him to learn the behavior expected by the society . The way in which he par ticipates in these relationships determines his personality . The extreme plasticity of his biological heritage permits him to modify his responses to meet the most diverse cultural expectations . This heritage differs from one individual to another , and no two persons receive exactly the same genetic combination . These hereditary differences are important in determining the basis of personality , but they properly constitute the subject matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are primarily concerned with the social and cultural influences that combine with the biological base to form the complete personality . We therefore direct our discussion to social interaction and its cultural products in the formation of personality.4 // The average person understands this process of interaction only im perfectly . He does not realize that his own personality or that of his friend is the product of years of learning in different sociocultural set tings . When someone shows an unhappy failing for drink , fast living , or delinquent behavior , our observer tends to attribute these activities to hereditary factors . He may examine the family of the transgressor for signs of similar behavior . If he finds ( or thinks he finds ) such " evi dence , " he concludes that " blood will tell . " For many people , the only possible explanation for such behavior is that the person was " born " that way . The influence of social interaction is either ignored or minimized . Personality is , however , a social product and must be defined in social terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its nature . Personality comes from the Latin word persona , the masks worn by the actors in the Roman theater . When the actor wished to become another person , he would change masks and thereby acquire a different " personality . " The term gradually came to be applied to the social roles that the individual plays , both off and on the stage . From this comes the sociological definition of personality : " the sum and or ganization of those traits which determine the role of the individual in the group . " 6 In this sense , personality is based upon the conditions under which the individual participates in social interaction . This process begins the moment he is brought into the world as a helpless little animal , en dowed with the possibilities for becoming a human being but requiring extensive social relationships to bring out these possibilities . These rela tionships include the loving attentions of his mother , his friendly strug gles with playmates , the instruction of his teachers , and his physical conflicts on the athletic field . The process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continues to exist in interper sonal relations . ' PERSONALITY AND SOCIALIZATION The process whereby personality is acquired through social interaction is known as socialization . Every society is faced with the // necessity of making a responsible member out of each child born into it . The child must learn the expectations of the society so that his behavior can be relied upon . He must acquire the group norms in order to take the behavior of others into account . In the process of socialization , he learns the reciprocal responses of the society , so that he can anticipate the behavior of others toward himself , as well as his own behavior toward others . The society must socialize each member so that his behavior will be meaningful in terms of the group norms and predictable to the other members . A minimum of conformity is fundamental to ordered social interaction . Socialization is the process by which this conformity is assured.8 Socialization and the acquisition of personality are thus two aspects of the same process . Socialization emphasizes the process in terms of society and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictable behavior by the members . From the standpoint of the indi vidual , this process stresses the way in which each person acquires his personality from his group contacts . The needs of the individual and the group are therefore reciprocal , although not necessarily synony mous . The group ordinarily demands a higher degree of conformity than the individual is willing to accept . A certain amount of deviance is found in every society , no matter how homogeneous and closely knit.9 Without a minimum of similarity between the aims of the indi vidual and those of the group , however , neither is able to function adequately . In the process of socialization , the group imparts different forms of expectations to the individual . These expectations range from food habits to patterns of religious worship , from sexual attitudes to defini tions of spending and saving , and from toilet-training to a world philosophy . The individual is influenced by various patterns of expec tations , depending upon the dimensions of the group that is socializing him at the moment . Some of these patterns are common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others are peculiar to certain racial or ethnic groups within the society . Others reflect the outlook of a broad social class , as lower-class patterns differ from those of the middle class in a number of respects . Still other patterns are unique to the particular peer group , adolescent clique , or family with which the individual is interacting . // In the present section and in those that follow , we shall be concerned with socialization from various points of view . Socialization has direct implications for the general study of personality . It has an equally immediate bearing upon Negro personality in the caste setting of the United States , where the Negro child perforce learns different re sponses from those the white child learns . Socialization likewise is closely related to differences between social classes . Social institutions in general , and the family in particular , are the principal agents of socialization . In short , society has a great variety of agencies of social ization , through which the individual learns the values , norms , and cultural expectations . The process of socialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in it . These elements include the following : 10 The basic disciplines . The first type of socialization of each indi vidual in point of time involves the basic physical disciplines . The child learns such things as what to eat and how to eat it , under what circumstances he may release the tensions of bowel and bladder , and the degree to which he must control the emotions of love , hatred , and fear . In his early years , he is also socialized with regard to sexual be havior , as that important activity is viewed in his particular group setting . An understanding of these and other physical and emotional disciplines is indispensable to making the child a responsible and pre dictable member of society . The accepted aspirations . Society is also concerned with imparting the basic goals , aspirations , and values to which the child is expected to direct his behavior for the rest of his life . In this context , he learns the accepted criteria of success , whether based upon money , political power , artistic achievement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these and other values . He learns the levels to which he is expected to aspire , and learns that these aspirations are limited by such fortuitous factors as the color of his skin , his name , his reli gious faith , or the social status of his parents . In this aspect of socializa tion , the society imparts to its maturing members the goals that are important and the way one goes about attaining them . The necessary skills . At the same time that he learns the accepted goals of his society , the child begins to acquire the necessary skills for reaching them . He learns , first of all , how to speak and thus assures // his ability to communicate with the other members , first by speaking and then ( perhaps ) by reading and writing . All other skills are based upon this rudimentary ability to communicate symbolically . After that come the techniques that he must have to act as a responsible member of society . These techniques reflect the way of life of the society and the place of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child differ widely from those required by the child in urban America . A considerable difference also exists between the skills of a working-class child and those of an upper-middle-class child in the same society . Whatever they are , these skills are an important part of the equipment imparted to the individual by socialization. 4 . The appropriate roles . A final general element in socialization is the acquisition of the appropriate social roles that the individual is expected to play . For present purposes , a social role may be considered as the pattern of expected behavior relative to a certain function or position in society . This concept is so important in the reciprocal proc esses of socialization and personality formation that we are devoting an entire chapter to it . Indeed , Parsons defines socialization as such as " the acquisition of the requisite orientations for satisfactory function ing in a role . " 11 We shall use the concept of socialization in a consid erably broader sense , but social roles nevertheless remain central to this process . As males , females , husbands , wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , teachers , worshipers , ministers , voters , work ers , and managers , the galaxy of social roles must be learned if the individual is to play a functional and predictable part in social inter-action . Socialization is both conscious and unconscious . The group may deliberately instil the appropriate expectations in the child , so that he will act in a responsible manner throughout his life . The mother who teaches her child how to talk , walk , and eat his spinach offers an exam ple of conscious socialization . The elaborate educational machinery of our society , from the nursery school to the graduate school , is the most obvious institutional medium of conscious socialization . Wherever and whenever one individual deliberately imparts a cultural pattern to an-other , socialization in this sense is taking place . The individual may learn imperfectly , incompletely , and inadequately . But the process of transmission is the important consideration , as each person slowly be-comes a more complete member of the group . The unconscious aspects of socialization are even more numerous , // complex , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspira tions , skills , and roles without realizing what he is doing . Merely by engaging in interaction with others , he becomes socialized in a variety of ways . The play group socializes the child with its own norms . The adolescent high school clique imparts its ideals and behavior patterns to its members with no visible difficulty . The delinquent gang instils norms that deviate from those of the larger society . Members of the gang learn these deviant patterns as easily as other adolescents learn the norms of society as a whole . COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL INTERACTION Social interaction takes place through symbolic communication . We have already considered some of the implications of this process in Chapter 2 . The transmission of learned behavior is impossible with-out some form of symbolic communication . A symbol is a word , sign , object , or gesture accepted by a group and standing for something else . A word is a symbol that may stand for an idea , emotion , experience , object , or imaginary condition . The meaning of a verbal symbol may range from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as are involved in words like God , liberty , or justice . Ability to communi cate through abstract symbols is the basis for social interaction . This ability is also fundamental to the development of personality.12 The faculty of communicating through symbols is uniquely human . Animals communicate by cries and gestures , but their action is not symbolic . Wolves can warn each other of approaching danger . Sheep can communicate emotional states , and collectively can work them-selves into a panic over real or suspected danger . Other animals can communicate on various sensory levels , whether by cries , smells , or sounds . But man is the only animal that is able to transfer meanings by symbols . Language is likewise a basic adjunct to the development of personality . Language symbols have certain general characteristics shared by all societies . These common elements are as follows : 13 1 . They are systematic . Language symbols are systematic because they represent systems of meanings . One part of the system can not be // understood without the others . The word for " husband " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing a word for " wife . " The child develops his personality by learning the systems of meanings of his culture . They are inherently social . Language symbols derive meaning from their use by members of the society and from mutual agreement . They evoke approximately similar reactions in the person who uses them and in the person to whom they are addressed . Social interaction is possible only when language symbols mean the same things to differ ent persons . The child learns to associate words with the appropriate elements in his expanding environment . They are voluntarily produced . Language symbols can be pro duced by the individual at any time , whether alone or in the company of others . Man can stimulate himself by language , in much the same way as he can stimulate others . The child continues the process of socialization by talking to himself when others are not present . In this way , he learns to identify himself with the group meanings . Personality development is marked by an increasing facility in com munication . The beginnings of language are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto meaningless cries begin to assume recognizable form . The word mama is traditionally the first word in the vocabulary of the English-speaking child . This symbol represents the most important object in his environment . The affectionate sympa thy of the mother endows many of the child 's random vocal gestures with meaning . She senses by his tone whether he wants a drink , a change of clothing , or is merely bored . In this way , she provides the principal liaison between the child and his human and nonhuman en vironment . When he imperiously summons her by calling " mama , " he is enjoying his first symbolic control of his world.14 The solicitude of the mother is not shared by others . The child must therefore develop his vocabulary if he is to communicate with anyone besides his mother . These limits are gradually expanded , and by the age of two he has a vocabulary of 250 words . His personality constantly changes as his interpersonal contacts increase . His broadening horizon becomes a part of himself , as he learns first that things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nouns and then verbs form the general order of linguistic development , as the child learns to partici pate more fully in society.15 // As the expansion of his vocabulary continues , the child also begins to acquire the normative expectations of his society . The folkways and mores gradually assume significance for him , and he learns to distin guish right from wrong in terms of the definitions of his culture . In order to formulate his reactions to his expanding world , he must first state them to himself . Before he can tell his mother about his fight on the playground , he must first phrase this experience in abstract and symbolic terms . Only then can he recount it so that another will under-stand . This process of formulation and telling is an education in itself and heightens the experience in his own mind . In this way , the adven tures of each day become a part of his expanding personality . This self-stimulation through language is an important part of per sonality development . The child can review in his own mind the en-counter he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to have with an enemy . In each case , he sets off an emotional response and thereby adds to his experience . Reading is a process in which the child enlarges his experience and his personality through language symbols . The child who grows up in a literate household and early acquires a wide vocab ulary is a different person from the one reared in a home where the symbolic experience is poorer . Each person can directly experience only a small part of his total environment . He must learn about most of it through communication . The person who communicates with others by reading , writing , or talking incorporates a larger segment of the world into his personality . There appear to be widespread differences between social classes in communication and hence in personality structure . Members of the middle class have more facility in symbolic communication and hence view the world in different terms from lower-class persons . As Kinsey discovered , lower-level males ( defined partially by level of school com pleted ) are less susceptible to sexual imagery than middle-class males . Kinsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modes of communication . His evidence is nevertheless significant in suggesting the relationship between personality and symbolic inter-action . " This relationship was approached more directly in another study , dealing with the ways in which disaster victims of different social levels communicated their experiences . These class differences involved a wide disparity in : 17 // ( a ) the number and kinds of perspectives utilized in communication ; ( b ) the ability to take the listener 's role ; ( c ) the handling of classifications ; ( d ) the frameworks and stylistic devices which order and implement the communication . Members of the different classes used the same language , but they did so in very different ways . Lower-class persons were unable to organize their thoughts in anything but a comparatively simple fashion . They could not put themselves in the place of their listener and think as he did , and they were unable to speak in general terms or categories . They told their stories in simple , direct terms as the stories appeared to themselves . They lacked the ability to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they might appear to another.18 PERSONALITY AND THE SOCIAL SELF The central element in the world of the individual is himself . Every man spends his life in a prolonged love-affair with himself . This does not mean that he is " selfish " in the usual sense of the term . It does mean that for every man , no matter how " unselfish " he is , his own self is the most important thing in the world . Each person is an individual with a unique set of genetic characteristics and a unique personal history . He is forced to look at himself through the eyes of others and in terms of their reactions to himself . The paradoxical aspect of this uniqueness and individuality , however , is that the self is a social product . The self arises in social interaction and continues through this process . Without early and continuous experience with other persons , the self would never emerge . In the most literal sense , the self is dependent upon society . We may suggest some of the implications of this dependence.19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The self is not present in the germ plasm in the same sense as blue eyes , curly hair , or a fair skin . The child acquires a social self through interaction with others . The self reflects the group situations in which he participates . The most important of these groups is the family . Here the child comes in contact with others during his most impressionable years and takes on the : attitudes toward himself of those who matter most . The elements of // the self that arise in this situation are the most basic . They constitute the core of the self and remain a central part of it through life 20 In this way , the person perpetuates the attitudes directed at him when he was a child . In Sullivan 's words , " the peculiarity exists that one can find in others only that which is in the self . " 21 The individual who grows up without affection from others will later find difficulty in giving it to others . He will express his own negative self-feelings by finding fault with others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestige . His low self-appraisal may have arisen in the beginning because , as a child , he was never sufficiently loved , appreciated , or made to feel secure in his attitude toward himself . He is condemned to express this low self-appraisal in his subsequent reac-tions with other persons . He looks at the world through the emotional atmosphere of distrust that he himself generates . In short , " that which is in the self is not dissociated from the self . " 22 The self has been called " a subject which is its own object . " Each person loves himself , hates himself , praises himself , blames himself , and punishes himself . Both the subject and the object of these verbs is the self . The attitude toward the self , furthermore , varies according to the group context . The football player may be sure of himself on the field and unsure of himself in the classroom . The child is " self-confident " when his mother is near , but collapses in a panic when she is not . The self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situa-tions . If the general tone of these situations throughout the early years has been friendly and affectionate , the general orientation of the self will tend to be secure ; if not , insecure . The subjective and objective aspects of the self have been viewed by Mead and others in terms of the pronouns I and me . The former is the subject of the self-attitudes , the latter is their object . The " I " is the active part of the self , the part that does things on its own , as it were . The " me " reflects the expectations and judgments of others . As stated by Foote and Cottrell , the " I " refers to " the active , assertive , and emer-gent features of human behavior , not reducible to standard roles in conventional situations . " The " me " is " the vested and organized experi-ence of the community as incorporated within personal conduct . " 2s // Cultural expectations are embodied in the " me , " whereas the " I " is more unique and individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction . The " I " holds attitudes about the " me , " and the latter reflects the judgments of others toward the " I. " This dialogue is a basic part of the conscious and unconscious mental life of every individual . These self-attitudes give rise to what Sullivan has called the " Good-me " and the " Bad-me . " The " Good-me " is the part of the self that reflects affection , tenderness , and generally pleasant treatment from others . This aspect is related to the mother , who is ordinarily the first one to give the child affection . She is the one who first loves him and thus causes him to love himself . The encouragement of these self-attitudes by the mother explains in large part the sentiments that the average person has toward her all his life.24 The " Bad-Me " reflects the dissatisfaction arising from lack of affec-tion from the mother or from other " significant others " in the environ-ment . One of the basic elements in the " Bad-me " is anxiety , arising from the feeling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love him . The person may be timid and insecure because of a basic anxiety in his interpersonal relations . People ordinarily try to avoid thinking and talking about the " Bad-me " because it makes them unhappy to do so . They prefer to think about the " Good-me , " for this image gives them pleasure . Both the " Good-me " and the " Bad-me " reflect the judgments of others toward the self , or at least the indi-vidual 's interpretation of these judgments . Both happiness and unhap-piness reflect this dual aspect of the self.25 The two aspects of the self embodied in the " I " and the " me " repre-sent an act that only a human being can perform . Man is the only species that can hold an attitude toward himself . Cows presumably do not worry about their immortal souls . Dogs make no discernible at-tempt to justify the ways of God to dogs . Man 's conception of himself is one of the principal elements that raise him above the level of the beasts . His capacity for infinite suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self and from the " reflected appraisals " that set its tone . In this sense , man is an animal with a social self . The aspect of the self as arising in social interaction has recently been subjected to empirical verification . In a number of experimental situations , the conception of the individual toward himself was com-pared with the conceptions of other members of the group toward him . A significant series of correlations emerged between the self-araisal // and the reflected appraisals of others . Each person viewed himself through the eyes of others . " The results of this research , " the authors conclude , " lend empirical support to the symbolic interactionist view of self-conception . Our findings , " they continue , " indicate that the response , or at least the attitude , of others is related to self-conception ; but they also indicate that the subject 's perception of that response is even more closely related . " 26 THE EMERGENCE OF THE SELF The infant is the center of his own universe . His wants are satisfied as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control over his environment , which initially consists largely of his family . During his early weeks , his behavior is completely selfish , in the sense that he seeks only to satisfy his own drives . The world is a place where there is little or no frustration and his wishes are law . This situation does not continue very long , and frustrations sooner or later arise . The infant is unable to receive food , warmth , affection , or physical attention at the precise moment that he wants them . At this point , he encounters for the first time the " reality " of the universe . He gradually learns that he must adjust to other persons and take them i into consideration . The development of the social self arises through this emerging interaction . The infant is not sensitive to the opinions of others , but as he grows older he becomes increasingly aware of them . At first a blind , unthinking little tyrant , he soon learns that other persons exist , who must be humored and manipulated . Only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so necessary to his emotional wellbeing . In this sense , " the self is a system within a personality , built up from innumerable experiences from early life , the central notion of which is that we satisfy the people that matter to us and therefore satisfy ourselves ... " 2z In the development of the self , the child learns the social norms of his group . These expectations are learned in the early process of interaction between the child and those who matter most to him . The mother is the principal instrument of this development , and the child // wishes to please her above all others . She imparts to him many of the basic folkways and mores and he incorporates them into the central fabric of his personality . In order to make the child obey these norma tive patterns , the actual presence of the mother is necessary at first . She must be physically there to register approval or disapproval to the child and thereby reinforce the cultural norms in his emerging per sonality.28 As he grows older , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his mother ( or mother substitute ) has given him , even though she is no longer present . She may , indeed , have been dead for many years , but the self-judgments that she has given him remain at the core of his personality . This process of self-judgment is called the conscience ( or the superego ) , and the maturing individual judges his actions by the standards thus learned in his early years . These standards are in the form of " symbol systems " ? that is , related patterns of words that embody the value judgments of the culture . These symbol systems involve such profound questions as moral judg ments , religious beliefs , and sexual attitudes . They go far to determine the way the individual views the world and his place in it . This process of self-judgment is partly conscious and partly unconscious . In many instances , the person is not even aware of the source of his self-judg ments and tends to view them as innate . There is no doubt , however , that conscience arises in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of social interaction in the emergence of the self , Cooley hit upon the happy phrase , " the looking-glass self , " to indicate this relationship . He based his discussion on the couplet , " Each to each a looking glass/Reflects the other that doth pass . " The person thus figuratively observes his image in the looking glass . He imagines the reaction of others to this image and is satisfied or ashamed as a result . Cooley has characterized this reflected image of the self as follows : " A self-idea of this sort , " he says , " seems to have three principal elements : the imagination of our appearance to the other person ; the imagination of his judgment of that appearance ; and some sort of self-feeling , such as pride or mortification . . . " 3 ? The girl getting ready for a dance is thus not dressing for herself // alone . She is more interested in what the boys ( and other girls ) will think of her appearance . As she looks into the mirror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face that looks back at her . In all of our social relationships , we are similarly wondering what others are thinking of us and how our actions are affecting them . If we feel that these judgments are favorable , our self-feeling is one of pride . If we fear that these judgments are derogatory , we experience uneasiness or mortification . Self-judgments depend in large part upon our conception of the judgments of others toward us . In this way , the self emerges and develops in continuous interaction with others . THE SELF AND THE OTHER We thus derive our self-attitudes by projecting ourselves into the minds of others . This process is known as " taking the role of the other . " The individual puts himself in the place of the other and tries to imagine what he would think under similar circumstances . Con sciousness of the self arises when the child starts to take the role of other persons and view himself as ( he believes ) they do . Many child-hood games are based on the child taking the role of others toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praises himself . He takes the role of his brothers and sisters and plays imaginary games with himself . He takes the role of a policeman and arrests himself . In this process , he gradually begins to see himself as others see him.31 The ability to take the role of the other corresponds roughly to what the psychologists call " empathy , " the emotional identification of one person with another . One person takes the role of the other and re sponds emotionally in the process , thereby exhibiting an " empathic response . " This type of response is basic to all social interaction , for the individual must enter into some kind of emotional identification with the other if he is to communicate with him . The person who is insensitive to the responses of others is lacking in " empathic ability , " or the ability to take the role of the other . In other words , " // same kind of operation which includes the incorporation in one 's own reac-tive system of the responses of another . The empathic responses are subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate fully in the emotions of others . They are warm , expressive , out-going , and optimistic . They are sympathetic to the reactions of others because they can participate in these reactions . Other persons are lacking in empathic ability and are correspondingly rigid , diffident , and inhibited . They keep to themselves because they can not participate in the responses of others . They do not make friends easily and their social relationships are limited and for-mal . They can not give themselves fully to another , for they are unable to put themselves in the other 's place . These differences in empathic response are relative , insofar as every human being possesses some ability to take the role of the other . Otherwise , he would be incapable of communicating with his fellows.33 As he takes the role of the other , the child begins to hold internal conversations with himself . These conversations involve the " significant others " in his environment ? the persons who matter to him . His mother is ordinarily the most " significant other " in his early experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family and later by persons outside the family . The child learns to anticipate the responses of these significant others by putting himself in their place . He expects affection from his mother and , ordinarily , from the other members of his family . As he grows older , however , he realizes that others will not have the same affectionate feeling for him . In the devel-opment of his social self , he learns to adapt his behavior to the ex-pected behavior of others.34 The social self is thus the object of self-attitudes , not the subject . The self arises in interaction with other persons and the individual looks at himself through their eyes . He feels happy or sad as he evokes praise or blame from those whose roles he takes in his imagination . By taking the role of others toward himself , he develops self-attitudes . Plead says , 35 // to himself only by taking the attitudes of other individuals toward himself within a social environment . . . in which both he and they are involved . In his early experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals toward himself . He takes the role of his mother , his father , and his brothers and sisters . Then his horizon broadens and he takes the role of a teacher , a policeman , or a soldier . A further development occurs when he begins to play games with other children . To play his role properly , he must understand the roles of the others . As he learns to act within a more complex pattern of expectations , his self becomes correspondingly more complex . At first , these games are spontaneous and the children work out the rules as they go along . The process be-comes more complicated when they play a formal game . These organ-ized patterns are vital for the child , for they are ( at the moment ) his most important business . The rules of the game are his moral precepts . His attitudes toward these rules ( and himself as a part of them ) go far toward determining his later attitudes toward moral codes in general.3 " This stage of role-taking may be illustrated by a football game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established by the rules of the game . Each one must be conscious of the parts of the others as well as his own . He responds in his imagination to these roles , and in so doing he stimulates himself . Every member of the team must be similarly con-scious of , and responsive to , the roles of the others . The action of each player thus depends upon his knowledge of all the roles that collec-tively comprise the rules of the game of football . The self grows by similar cooperative activities , all taking different forms in different societies . Chinese boys obviously do not play football to develop the cooperative attitudes basic to the social self . Every so-ciety has its own group activities in which a definite series of reciprocal responses is expected of everyone . In this way , each maturing indi-vidual learns to take the role of the other toward himself and thereby develops his own self.37 THE SELF AND THE GENERALIZED OTHER The most complex stage in the development of the social self arises when the individual begins to take the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant segment of it ) toward himself . Mead calls this " takin the role of the generalized other . " In a narrow sense , the generalized other refers to the roles , attitudes , and expectations of all the other persons in a particular social situation , such as an organized game . In a broader sense , it refers to the organized culture patterns of the entire society . The generalized other includes the folkways , mores , values , and other normative elements in a culture . The child slowly becomes conscious of these expectations and begins to judge himself in these terms.38 The generalized other is not the same for all persons . Each one has different self-attitudes toward the basic concerns of life , even though general similarities do exist among all persons reared in the same so-ciety . In a simple society , the generalized other is homogeneous , and all the members are able to view their own behavior in much the same light . Studies of primitive societies have confirmed this general sim-ilarity of basic philosophy , at least until the pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homogeneity is conspicuously lacking in our society . This social world is so complex that each child merely receives a part of the total normative expectations of the culture . The literature on social class differences indicates clearly that the generalized other that each child incorporates into his personality is different . Persons reared in middle-class environments have very different attitudes from lower-class per-sons toward such diverse aspects of the generalized other as sex norms 40 and attitudes toward personal aggression.41 There appear to be significant differences , indeed , in attitudes toward the self between social classes . Persons in the middle and upper classes show greater aggression against the self than do those in the lower class . The aggres-sions of the latter appear to be more strongly directed against other persons than against the self.42 The concept of the generalized other as developed by Mead should , therefore , be modified to take account of this heterogeneity . Instead of one homogeneous generalized other , there are many generalized others within the same society . The child is exposed to one or more of these generalized others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // his personality the version of his social class or sub-culture , as medi ated to him by his parents , brothers and sisters , peer groups , and sim ilar agencies . This version becomes the " significant " other as far as he is concerned and may differ in many important respects from that held by others . The standards by which the individual judges himself when he takes the role of the generalized other are thus subject to consider-able variation within the same complex society . " The peer group is important in defining and incorporating the ver sion of the generalized other to which the individual ultimately re sponds . The peer group is a group of boys orirls of about the same age who have the same basic attitudes.44 In the development of his social self , the child is continually interacting with a succession of such groups , and they provide an important part of his social environment . He learns from them many of the rules of the game to serve as refer ence points for similar future situations . In certain respects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in establishing the ver sion of the generalized other to which the adolescent responds . In such an essential element of the generalized other as religion , the attitudes of the peer group seem to be more influential than those of the family in determining the reactions of the adolescent.45 The process by which the child incorporates his version of the gen eralized other is complex and gradual . The infant has no abstract moral values , but is instead extremely egocentric . He has no feeling for , or consideration of , other persons and must be taught to take , first , the role of the other and , later , the role of the generalized other . His morality is highly personal and is largely concerned with the behavior of other persons toward himself . A conception of abstract moral prin ciples , reflecting the values of the society , comes much later . The child soon learns that he must not wantonly strike his younger brother and vice versa ; these are interpersonal relations that affect him directly . It takes him much longer to learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to do with himself . The degree to which he understands and accepts these general principles of morality varies // between individuals . Some persons never completely grasp these essen tial elements of the generalized other.4 " SOCIAL INTERACTION AND THE GENERALIZED OTHER The gradual acquisition of the generalized other as a part of the personality is indicated in the development of language habits . The child of two or three has not yet begun to take the role of the generalized other and hence does not think of himself as a member of a cooperative society . The words most commonly used at this age are I , me , my , and mine . Verbs are in the imperative mood , as the child demands the attention of others in his immediate environment . The use of self-words and imperative sentences decreases as he grows older and learns that there are others in the world , whose wishes must also be considered.47 At four or five , he begins to play simple games requir ing an awareness of others and an ability to take their roles . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in order to gain these benefits for his expanding self , he must play the game according to the rules . As the social self emerges , " selfishness " declines . The concept of the generalized other may be further illustrated by the attitude of a person toward private property . When two boys strug gle over a baseball glove , each may invoke the concept of private prop erty in defense of his own interests . One boy insists that he found the glove and that it therefore belongs to him . The other maintains that his father bought it for him , that he laid it down for a moment , and that it is indubitably his property . They are both invoking the abstract atti tude toward private property that is a central part of the generalized other in our society . They agree on the importance of private owner-ship , but they disagree on the circumstances under which each can appeal to this concept . Each is taking the role of the generalized other toward himself as well as toward his adversary . Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reli religion , property , democratic government , and the like . The individual incorporates these principles into his social self by taking the role of // give him what we term his principles , the acknowledged attitudes of all members of the community toward what are the values of that com-munity . He is putting himself in the place of the generalized other , which represents the organized responses of all the members of the group . The social self is the core of the personality . The self develops in interaction with other persons , as the individual learns to take the role of the other toward himself . This interaction is marked by imaginary projection into different levels of experience . In his early experience , the child takes the role of the other in a simple and direct sense . He acts toward himself as mother , father , brother , sister , and member of the peer group . As he learns to play games , he learns to take the role of several other persons , as well as that of a pattern of group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final stage of development when the individual begins to take the role of society in general ( or a sig-nificant part of it ) toward himself . He then judges himself in terms of the normative aspects of the culture . Throughout the rise of the social self , the relationship between the self and other persons is close and continuous.49 The social self that emerges from this process is a unique product . The criticism is sometimes made that the interpersonal concept of the self destroys the uniqueness and individuality of each human being . Nothing could be farther from the truth . In the first place , the unique-ness of each person is assured by the biological unity of the organism , whereby each individual has a unique combination of genes . In the second place , and more germane to the interactional approach , is the fact that each self develops in a series of different group settings . Pat-terns of interaction by which the self evolves are different for every individual . Even identical twins in the same family interact uniquely with others inside and outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to personality emphasizes the individual-ity and uniqueness of each person . The social process is similar for everyone , in that each person uses symbolic communication , although even here complete language uniformity does not exist . Each individual nevertheless takes the role of the other and the generalized other to-ward himself and further participates in the same general process . the generalized other toward himself . The responses to this process , says Mead , 48 // Despite these general similarities , according to Mead , " every indi vidual self has its own peculiar individuality , its own unique pattern , because each individual self . . . reflects in its organized structure a different aspect or perspective of this whole social behavior pattern from that which is reflected in the organized structure of any individual self within that process . " 51 Each person participates in the social proc ess and develops a self by taking others into account . The ultimate product of each individual experience is a unique human being . // 9 PERS0IALITY , STATUS , AND ROLL LEVELS OF PERSONALITY The relationship between personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first considered the growth of personality in terms of the social self , which is both the core of the personality and its most clearly interactional aspect . The present chapter continues the analysis of personality as it emerges in the course of social interaction . The conceptual framework next includes the principal structural forms within which the personality develops . These structural elements are ( a ) the status that the individual occupies in the society and ( h ) the role ( s ) that he plays as a result of this status . In the actual evolution of personality , the social self is inextricably related with the statuses of the individual and the roles he plays . The separation here 181 a // is only for purposes of exposition . In practice the personality is a C whole.l A discussion of personality includes both the general and the indi vidual elements in this complex biological and social product . In the scientific division of labor , the sociologist has been largely concerned with the general elements , whereas the biologist and the psychologist have studied the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more detail , we may indicate the various levels on which personality may be viewed . These levels or determinants com prise four major categories.2 Universal determinants . All human beings have certain common ( universal ) personality traits merely because they are human . These universals arise from the fact that man is : ( a ) an animal with a distinc tive physical and mental equipment ; ( b ) a social animal that lives in groups ; ( c ) a cultural animal capable of symbolic communication ; and ( d ) a biological animal living in a physical world to which he must adjust.3 Communal determinants . All the members of a society have cer tain traits in common with other members of the same society . Amer icans share more personality traits with other Americans than with Frenchmen . Membership in a society produces a degree of similarity of personality . The values of a society , the goals it holds out to its members , the roles it prescribes for them , and the common meanings that they share thus constitute some of the communal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain positions are assigned to individuals on t Ie asis of age , sex , marital status , family , and sim ilar criteria . Each of these positions carries a pattern of common expec tations , so that each man has certain personality traits in common with every other man in the society by virtue of their common male role . // These patterns are culturally defined , and they constitute some of the most important determinants of personality in any society.5 4 . " Idiosyncratic " determinants . Every individual ( except an iden-tical twin ) has a unique genetic equipment and each ( without excep-tion ) has a unique life experience . Hence the various determinants listed above influence each one in a different way . Brothers in the same family have a different order of birth and , therefore , do not have the same roles . The culture is interpreted to each person in a different fashion , the roles are played in a slightly different way , and the statuses are subject to individual variations.6 We have briefly indicated the range of factors in personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through those common to mem-bers of a particular society ( communal ) , and those common to all members of a particular society who occupy certain statuses and play certain roles ( role determinants ) , to those ( idiosyncratic ) that make each personality unique . These factors are social and cultural in char-acter and do not take into consideration the biological elements in personality . We shall deal here primarily with the social determinants , with particular reference to those arising from the position that the individual occupies in society and the roles that he plays as a result . Learning the social determinants of personality is in effect the proc-ess of socialization . Every society is a complex network of such recipro-cal expectations . The child is taught to follow these patterns and thus to become a responsible member of the group . Part of the socialization process is deliberate , as parents , teachers , ministers , and friends instil the group norms into the growing child . Other aspects of socialization - are largely unconscious , in the sense that they arise from spontaneous interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest accepted slang , dance music , radio comedians , and fashions without any deliberate plan on either side . THE NATURE OF SOCIAL ROLES Personality may be considered sociologically as the combina-tion of roles that the individual plays in his social relationships . A role is a pattern of expected behavior associated with a certain position in , // a society . The adult male in the United States has a pattern of cul turally determined behavior ascribed to him merely because of his adultness and maleness . The role is defined by the society , and the individual has little to say regarding the privileges or responsibilities of his role . From earliest infancy , he is given a progressively changing set of roles appropriate to his age and sex , and he is expected to play them with reasonable persistence and accuracy . ' In this sense , society may be viewed as a complex and interrelated system of positions ( statuses ) . The individual occupies several of these positions and each of them carries certain shared assumptions concern ing the functions that the person is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions and their relationships , rather than in the individuals who happen to occupy them . These statuses have an important effect upon personality , and they become the role determi nants to which we have referred . Social roles carry a whole complex pattern of expectations . The doc tor knows what is expected of him and his patients likewise know how they are expected to act . Folkways and mores are also group expec tations , but they are more general than social roles . The latter are attached to a particular position in society and are more or less inde pendent of the person who happens to be occupying the position at the moment . The lawyer has a certain role as lawyer and not as John Smith . Teachers and pupils have clusters of expectations attached to their positions , and these expectations guide their behavior in the appropriate role . Every society has dozens of these generalized pat-terns , and some societies have thousands of them . When each person acts in accordance with his role ( s ) , the group functions smoothly . Roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they not only com prise the expected behavior of an individual in a situation , but also the behavior of others toward him . In this sense , a role has been de-fined as : 8 an internally consistent series of conditioned responses by one member of a social situation which represents the stimulus pattern for a similarly in ternally consistent series of conditioned responses of the other(s) in that situation . // The roles of officer and enlisted man offer a formalized example of this reciprocity . Each is expected to act in certain ways toward the other , with the salute symbolizing the quality of the relationship . The Army is essentially an authoritarian institution , in the sense that a clear line of authority must be observed at all times . The roles of officers and men help to make the institution run efficiently . Each society defines the roles its members are expected to play . This definition is not deliberate , but arises in spontaneous social interaction and is handed down in the same way . In his analysis of socialization , Parsons stresses the acquisition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general process . ' Socialization also involves a variety of other learning situations , in addition to those related to social roles . Nevertheless , training in role behavior is clearly basic to the total proc cess of making responsible group members . The central institutional relationship of the family embodies the roles of father , mother , brother , sister , husband , wife , son , and daugh ter , to name only those in most active operation in our society . The economic institution has likewise evolved a series of roles appropriate to the hierarchy of business and industry : laborer , clerk , foreman , sales-man , junior executive , president , and chairman of the board are but some of them . " ? Each person plays a number of roles , depending upon his relationship at the moment . He successively plays the role of father , husband , clerk , citizen , and religious observer , as he takes his appro priate part in different groups and institutions . The average person attempts to play his various roles as adequately as possible , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early years of life , he tries to play the role of a good child , for by so doing he gains the affection of the most important element in his environ ment , namely , his mother . When the child plays his role as his mother wishes , the aspect of the social self that Sullivan calls " Good-me " is fostered . When the child fails to play his expected role , he experiences anxiety , since his behavior is criticized or rejected by his mother . This is the " Bad-me , " and the child takes the attitude of the disapproving mother toward himself and views himself as an unsatisfactory child . In this way , he takes on the emotional reactions of others toward him-self and reacts accordingly.11 // THE DYNAMICS OF SOCIAL ROLES Roles are therefore highly dynamic motivating forces in be havior . They are not merely abstract categories of behavior but are also determinants of action and therefore of personality . The newly married man regards his wife in terms of the roles that he expects her to play toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from persons outside the family , from mass media , such as the movies , and from other sources . His activity in his newly acquired status as husband reflects such factors as : 12 . . . his own preformed role concepts , his own expectations regarding the reciprocal roles of his mate , his mate 's expectations regarding him , and the degree of correspondence between the two sets of role-concepts and expec tations. . . . lln any case , he is motivated to act in one way or another by his role-expectations . Human life is much more than an individual venture . It is also a social experience . Each person acts out a set of expected roles and looks at other persons in terms of them . In social interaction , each takes the other into account partially through the roles each is playing at the time . The criminal knows what to expect from the policeman , the patient has learned what to look for in the doctor , and the husband has strong preconceptions concerning the role of his wife . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , subject to differ ences of interpretation . But in many respects each person still knows what to expect . If he did not , if each individual acted entirely without prior socialization ( that is , " individually " ) , organized group life would be impossible . Social roles are not always consistent . Some are clearly contradictory , and the person is expected to perform contradictory acts by following the expectations of different roles . Some of these difficulties may be personal : a man who has been devoted to his mother may find it hard to transfer his affection to his wife . Here the roles of son and husband become confused , and the individual is unable to play either one adequately.13 In other cases , the contradictions are implicit in the culture . // The demands of the economic role are for aggressive behavior toward other persons in the competitive world . The expectations of the Chris-tian role , on the other hand , are for humility and gentleness toward others . The majority of persons escape any fundamental difficulty in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the religious role . The implicit conflict is , nevertheless , there.14 Social roles involve varying degrees of compulsion . Certain behavior is required of the person filling a role , whereas other behavior is ex-pressly forbidden . Within these limits , a considerable range of behavior is permitted , but not demanded , of the individual in his role capacity . The doctor is required to cure the sick to the best of his ability . He is forbidden to put an end to life , even though the patient may be dying in terrible pain of an incurable and inoperable disease . Within these limits , however , considerable discretion is granted as to how he shall play his role as doctor . He may exact high prices for his services or he may treat many people free of charge ; he may be a family doctor or a specialist ; and he may develop a congenial bedside manner or a brusque aloofness . The basic expectations of the role , however , are produced by the society , or by a group within it , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We may summarize the basic elements of the social role as applied to the formation of personality . The social role is learned in the course of socialization . The individual " internalizes " ( that is , absorbs ) the basic values that go with the role and give it meaning.l " The role in-volves : ( a ) the identification of the personality and the social self with the role , so that the latter becomes an emotional personal experience ; ( b ) the definition by the society of the patterned behavior appropriate to situations occurring regularly ; ( c ) the reciprocity of these patterns , whereby each role is related to other roles , as the role of husband is related to the role of wife ; and ( d ) the self-evaluation of the individual of his comparative success or failure in his role . In this sense , the reac-tion of the person arises from the " reflected appraisals " of the " looking-glass self . " 17 // THE SOCIAL SETTING OF THE ROLE Roles differ between societies and subcultures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in primitive societies . Boys of fourteen are considered hardly more than children in our society , whereas in other societies they are ready for the adult role . Girls of twelve in American society are not ordinarily considered of marriage-able age , whereas their readiness to assume this adult role is taken for granted in other societies . Adolescent and adult roles are not so much matters of age as of social definition , and adulthood is reached much earlier in primitive societies . The role of son or daughter in our own society implies a long period of adolescence , during which the adoles-cent is free to amuse himself with few social responsibilities.18 In many primitive societies , childhood and adolescence have differ-ent roles and involve greater responsibilities . ' The child is often ex-pected to carry water , gather wood , repair nets , cultivate rice , clean fish , grind grain , take care of younger children , and otherwise partici-pate in the serious activities of the society . Under such conditions , the transition from childhood to adulthood is gradual , the adolescent slowly assuming additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full adult role . In our society , boys and girls are sometimes obliged to assume adult roles before they are emotionally prepared for them . An early marriage often brings a sudden transition from the carefree years of adolescence to the cares of adulthood . The high di-vorce rate among couples married under twenty years of age suggests that the boy or girl of this age is often unprepared for an adult role . Social roles thus bring out or limit behavior in the individual , de-pending upon the different social settings . In our society , adolescents are ordinarily not expected to play significant roles outside of their narrowly prescribed orbit of education and amusement . In an earlier day , youths of eighteen were painting great pictures , writing epic poems , serving in royal cabinets , and commanding armies . In contem-porary American society , boys of this age are not expected to be con-cerned with anything more serious than adjusting to their peer group , finding an appropriate date for the junior Prom , and graduating with reasonable grades from High School . In this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adolescent by not expecting much of him . // The entire repertoire of family roles differs between societies . In many peasant societies , patriarchal roles remain virtually intact from an earlier day . The role of the father still involves dominance in many family relationships , whereas that of the wife exacts submission on many matters that would be subject to joint discussion in the United States . When the son and daughter in the peasant society wish to marry , they must gain the assent of the patriarchal father . The mere statement of these roles indicates their disparity with the corresponding roles in our society . The patriarchal family is hardly recognizable in the American scene.20 Family roles constitute perhaps the most tightly knit pattern in any society . The child is exposed to these roles from birth , and he learns that his position carries responsibilities and obligations as well as rights and privileges . As a child , the role of son or daughter emphasizes the care lavished by the parent . In later years , these roles carry reciprocal obligations ? affectional or economic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Social roles are social phenomena in the most literal sense , for their meaning exists only in relationship to others.21 The rapid transition from a rural , agricultural society to an urban , industrial society has brought many role changes in the family . Chil dren can now become economically independent and must no longer look to an inheritance from the father . With approximately one out of every four married women now gainfully employed , the roles of hus band and wife have also undergone dramatic changes . The wife who is actively contributing to the support of the family has acquired an equality that was never dreamed of a century ago . The husband can no longer be the arbiter of the destiny of his wife.22 The system of family roles inherited from an earlier day is in the process of rapid disorganization . Men and women are not performing their roles in accordance with traditional definitions . This inability does not arise from any personal failure , but instead reflects basic changes in society . Wives can not continue to act solely as homemakers and moth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can190 PERSONALITY , STATUS , AND ROLE not continue to be dominant when the wife is adding substantially to the family income . Men and women are confronted with situations not of their own making , in which traditional roles no longer apply . They are forced to improvise their behavior instead of following an accepted role . Such improvisation is difficult . Disappointment and frustration are the price of failure.23 THE NATURE OF SOCIAL STATUS Status is the position a person occupies in society by virtue of his age , sex , birth , occupation , marriage , or achievement . The role is the part he is expected to play in each of these statuses . Status and role are reciprocal aspects of personality and relate to different com ponents of the functioning whole . Both are social products , and one could not exist without the other . Emphasis shifts from role to status and back again as we study the structural aspects of personality . So ciety determines the status that the individual occupies and the corre sponding role that he plays . Linton defines status as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual occupies at a particular time , " whereas role refers to " the sum total of the culture patterns associated with a particular status . " 24 Status is initially ascribed to the individual on the basis of his sex , age , and birth . Roles are learned on the basis of status and represent their dynamic aspects . Status is an important element in per sonality , both objectively and subjectively . The objective status of the individual may not be as important as the subjective definitions by others and himself . Self-attitudes are partially based upon status , and the image a person has of himself reflects the judgments held by others.25 Status is commonly ( and erroneously ) applied only to the position of the individual in the prestige systems of his society . Certain people are sometimes said to possess " more " status than others because they occupy certain positions in the social structure . This distinction does not apply to the present concept of status , which refers to positions in all of the systems of society . In this sense , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office boy . Both have certain positions in // the occupational system and possess appropriate statuses . The rights , duties , and prerogatives of the president are more complex than those of the office boy . But each pattern is a product of social interaction and invokes certain recognizable expectations in the participants . The self-judgments related to each status are , as noted , significant elements in the personality . But the concept of status , as such , carries no neces-sary value-judgments.2f The value-judgments rest in the valuation that society places upon certain statuses and roles . Some roles are obviously more highly valued than others , and receive a proportionately greater share of money , pres-tige , special favors , and other scarce goods and services . Every society has certain functions that it considers important , and it rewards the persons who perform these functions . Our own society values the roles of business executive , industrialist , salesman , and entertainer . These roles are rewarded accordingly . Our society does not place a high valuation upon the roles of minister , teacher , scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other societies , these roles are highly valued and remunerated accordingly . Many ambitious young men aspire to roles with high valuation , and comparatively few seek those where the val-uation is more modest . In this way , the society brings out certain qual-ities in its members and restricts others.27 The person has status in several different groups . The high school boy has one status on the football field , another in the classroom , and a third at home . The adult male has one status as a worker , another as a father , another as a club member , and still another as a church-goer . He plays successively the role of businessman , parent , colleague , and deacon . Each position involves a different status , which in turn evokes an appropriate role . In our society , economic status dominates the others . The respect connected with high economic standing often sets the tone for the personality . A man may be a poor father , an unfaith-ful husband , and a disloyal friend . But if he is successful in making large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be forgotten . The plasticity of the human being at birth is such that socialization directs him toward a variety of statuses in which he will play a variety of roles . Within the limits of his genetic ability , a boy can be taught to play the role of architect , doctor , lawyer , or farmer . A girl can learn to play the role of stenographer , housekeeper , nun , or debutante . Some // of these statuses are given by virtue of age and sex , others by the family in which one is born . Still others represent individual achieve ment in a competitive society . Whatever its nature , the status derives from the society and is not made up by the individual . Personality emerges from the interaction between socially defined statuses and roles and the genetic equipment of the individual . The relationship between status and personality has recently been investigated on another level . A number of persons of different profes sional statuses were studied in terms of their " status crystallization . " Those who measured high in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupational status , better-than-average edu cation , and high ethnic status . Those who measured low in status crys tallization were lower in one or more of the above classifications . This latter category included such groups as college professors ( low in in-come level ) , Hollywood actors ( low in formal education ) , Jewish business men ( low in ethnic status ) , and the Protestant clergy ( also low in income level ) . The personalities of these men of diverse back-grounds were found to have certain common qualities because of their low status crystallization . This similarity was especially marked in political attitudes , all four groups tending to have " liberal " political attitudes and voting records.211 The explanation suggested for the similarity among those of low status crystallization is that each group was not completely secure in respect to all aspects of its status . These men were , in a sense , all " marginal " men and showed an interest in changing the status quo by participating in liberal ( not radical ) political movements . On such questions as government health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the four groups showed a surprising consist ency , even though their status in purely economic terms differed as between college professors and Protestant clergymen on the one hand and Hollywood actors and wealthy Jewish businessmen on the other . In this study , the complex relationships between status and personality are suggestively indicated.20 , FORMS OF SOCIAL STATUS There are two principal forms of status , ascribed and achieved . Linton refers to them as follows : 30 // Ascribed statuses are those which are assigned to individuals without reference to their innate differences or abilities . They can be predicted and trained for from the moment of birth . The achieved statuses . . . are those reduirn special dualities although , they are not necessarily limited , to these . They are not assigned to individuals from birth but are left open to be filled through competition and individual effort . The over-all patterns of status and role are thus partially established at birth and partially achieved thereafter . Societies differ as to the number and importance of the statuses that are ascribed and those that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the statuses are ascribed , and the place of the individual is ordinarily fixed by the accident of birth . In democratic and industrialized societies , greater importance is attached to achieved status . Substantial rewards are held out to those who are successful in the competition for achieved status . The United States has always been proud of the predominance of achieved over ascribed status . Society places various limits upon achieved status . Even in our own society , status-achievement is not as free as many people would like to think . Race is the most spectacular single limitation , and the Negro has , until recently , been strictly limited to menial jobs . Even today , the achievement of high elective office is impossible for him . Sex is another status limitation in a variety of fields in our society . Women have made tremendous strides in recent decades , not only in business , industry , and the professions , but in elective office as well . Nevertheless , the day is still presumably far distant when a woman will be elected President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , national , and religious factors . Each of these has been instrumental in keeping members of minority groups from achieving high elective office in the United States . At different stages in his life , the individual occupies different ascribed statuses . His status as a child differs from his status as an adolescent . After he has reached maturity and presumably " put away childish things , " he acquires other statuses . The seven ages of man , as depicted by Shakespeare , illustrate the typical progression , from the infant mewling in the nurse 's arms , through the schoolboy creeping unwillingly to school , to the old man " sans everything . " All societies have some division of status on the basis of age ; as the individual inexorably passes through life , he finds that each period has its ascribed privileges and responsibilities . Age provides a fundamental basis on which society ascribes different statuses to its members , largely without regard for their individual abilities , // Each status has its role . Society expects different behavior from per-sons holding different statuses : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early interest in the home and the family ; boys are expected to scorn such feminine activities and concentrate on manly sports and games . The responses that are expected of boys and girls are inculcated at an early age . Recent empirical studies indicate that preschool boys are taught to be less dependent and more aggressive than girls . The latter tend to identify themselves more strongly with their mothers than is the case with boys . These early differences in masculine and feminine roles are not always taught deliberately , but they are consistently present in the culture patterns . " The normal functioning of society depends upon a widespread ac ceptance of ascribed status and the corresponding role . Persons who depart consistently from the roles considered appropriate to their status are viewed with suspicion , for they present grave difficulties to social stability . People must act substantially as they are expected to act or social relations become chaotic . Girls who persistently dress in boys ' clothes and play boys ' games are frowned upon by their elders . Boys who play the role of girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as children are usually incarcerated in mental institu tions . Each society has its roles considered appropriate to the various ascribed statuses . Societies differ in the number and relative importance of statuses prescribed by tradition . Primitive societies tend to be more rigid in this respect and rarely tolerate pronounced deviations from the con ventional patterns . In such societies , social mobility is rare and people do not ordinarily rise or fall from the status ascribed to them at birth . These ascriptions are rarely questioned , for the process of socialization is usually sufficient to insure their acceptance . The primitive man who is asked by a visiting anthropologist why his society is organized as it is will usually have two replies , actually two aspects of the same thing . He will answer : ( a ) that it has always been so ; and ( b ) that the gods have willed it so . In either case , the matter is closed . TRENDS IN ACHIEVED STATUS The United States represents the triumph of achieved over ascribed status . The social structure in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome , as was the case in western Europe . Furthermore , a new continent awaited the exploitation of its resources , with few hereditary factors to interfere . Men of humble birth became millionaires ; the log cabin was the birthplace of presi dents ; and farm boys became captains of industry . This ability to rise in the social scale and reach the heights of achieved status is known as the American Dream.32 The present status of the American Dream is open to considerable question . Some persons maintain that it is virtually impossible to over-come the handicaps of lower-class background and rise to a position of high status in the business world . Others are equally vehement in insisting that the way to the top is still open to men of ability and initiative . We shall not attempt to explore this problem at any length here , but shall consider the trends in social mobility in Chapter 15 . Briefly , the situation appears to be that the majority of men who occupy positions of authority come from the upper levels of society . The backgrounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two-thirds of them came from families whose status was well above the average for the country as a whole . More than half of these leaders were sons of owners or executives and another 14 per cent were sons of professional men . 33 High family status is thus an important ( perhaps the most impor tant ) factor in business success today . Boys whose fathers are leaders of business and industry have a considerable initial advantage over those whose fathers are white-collar workers , farmers , or laborers . At the same time , the fact that a third of the business elite did come from lower-status backgrounds indicates that the American Dream in indi vidual cases is still far from dead . Sons of laborers , farmers , and white-collar workers can still make their way to the top in American business , provided they can get a higher education . This latter factor is becom ing increasingly indispensable to the achievement of status , especially for those who must make their own way without benefit of family help . 34 On a broader scale , other changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first fifty years of the present century , the proportion of unskilled workers declined from 15 to less than 10 per cent of the // population . At the same time , semi-skilled workers increased from 15 to 20 per cent of the population . This change reflects the mechanization of industry and the consequent increase in the number of persons tend ing machines , rather than working with pick and shovel . In this shift from unskilled to semi-skilled labor there is an upgrading in occupation ( and indirectly in status ) of a considerable segment of the population . " Persons do not always adjust to their status and role , whether achieved or ascribed . Wives of successful business men may be unable to play the roles that the hard-won status of their husbands demands . Women from lower social levels whose husbands become business leaders often have difficulty in growing along with them . This situation may cause frustration in the wives , the husbands , or both . In some instances , the husbands " solve " the problem by keeping their wives in the background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate their business lives as completely as possible from their family lives . Some wives of successful men are content to play this role , others are not . Role changes from one class to another are often difficult to make . 36 In a more general sense , both men and women may be unable to act in the manner expected of them . Certain women may be temper amentally unsuited to play the traditional feminine role of wife and mother and may seek to compensate in a career . They often pay for their success in a professional role by psychological and social frustra tions.37 When the individual of either sex is unable to live up to the expectations of his role , he may develop self-feelings of anxiety.3s The relationship between self-feeling and the performance of basic roles is very close . The man who is unable to earn a decent living , the wife who is unable to bear children , and the child who fails in school all fail in a central role . THE SEXUAL BASIS OF STATUS The influence of ascribed status upon personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this process ? namely , the // ascription of personality characteristics on the basis of sex . Other ex amples involve such factors as occupation 30 and social class ' 40 but the sexual ascription is the most important . In every society , certain per sonality traits are selected and then ascribed largely or exclusively to males or females , merely because of their maleness or femaleness . This selection is not deliberate or planned , but arises in the slow and spon taneous manner of the folkways and mores . Each individual at birth has certain genic traits that may be defined as either masculine or feminine by his society . Many of the traits that have " always " been considered as sex-linked are now realized to be , at least in part , the product of assigned status and role.41 Society thus " elaborates " the biological differences between the sexes . This means that the obvious differences between men and women are taken as the basis for ascribing a variety of other differences , some of them cultural in origin . The fact that men procreate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The assumption that men are " naturally " more capable of understanding politics , painting pictures , or practicing a profession , however , is an unwarranted addi tion to this biological fact . The traditional beliefs concerning the dif ferences between the sexes are based upon many such gratuitous elaborations on the central fact of sexual differentiation . Many aspects of these beliefs go back to Biblical times , when the patriarchal family was the principal institution defining status and role . The patriarchal definitions assumed that men were " naturally " im perious , dominant , aggressive , and generally fitted to wrestle with the complex affairs of a masculine world . Women were assumed to be con stitutionally timid , submissive , and generally unfitted to cope with life outside the home . These assumptions have had the support of organ ized religion and unassailable public opinion . " Masculine " traits have accordingly been cultivated for thousands of years in boys and " fem inine " traits in girls . The biological basis of these statuses and roles has seemed as natural as the stars . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered axiomatic , one of the few things that remained fixed in a changing world . These ascribed statuses have undergone drastic changes in recent // decades . Statistics on the gainful employment of women offer the most irrefutable evidence that the traditional personality traits ascribed to the female sex were not based upon unalterable genetic factors . The biological characteristics of women have not changed since the Vic-torian Age ; but the society in which women live has changed radically during the same period . The role of women has been revised since the days when they were considered capable only of bearing children , caring for the home , and attending divine services . Many secondary personality differences between the sexes are disappearing as men and women sit side by side in the classroom , office , and factory.42 The influence of society in ascribing personality traits to each sex is strikingly illustrated in studies of primitive societies . The most con-clusive of these studies was made of three small tribes on the island of New Guinea in the South Pacific . In one of these societies , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle , and " maternal . " Male and female both have the personality attributed in our society to the female . In a second tribal society , both sexes are aggressive , driving , and domineering . They display the personality traits that our society attributes to the more " masculine " among the males . In the third society , the roles of the sexes are almost completely turned around . The women are dominant and aggressive and the men are submissive and gentle . The " normal " roles of the sexes are thus reversed . In terms of the status-ascription of our society , the women are " men " and the men are " women . " 43 Many differences between the sexes in different societies are thus seen to be the products of social conditioning , especially during the plastic years of childhood.44 In this connection , Margaret Mead states that " Standard personality differences between the sexes are ... cul-tural creations to which each generation , male or female , is trained to conform . " 45 Woman and human female are thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon , whereas " woman " is a social product .4G // In this chapter , we have explored some of the structural aspects of personality , with particular emphasis upon status and role . The hier archy of statuses and roles is extremely complex in American society , in contrast to the comparative simplicity of many primitive societies . In our own society , the traditional expectations associated with the various statuses are in many cases no longer consistent with the way of life . The person is forced to adjust an historic role to fit a new situa tion , as the modern working wife must adapt her traditional role to the exigencies of office , shop , or factory . The emphasis upon achieved over ascribed status in an industrial democracy is another structural factor in the determination of personality . The number and variety of possible statuses open to the individual under these conditions are very large . The role determinants of personality tend to vary accordingly . // // AND CULTURE CULTURAL ASPECTS OF PERSONALITY The group is the bearer of culture . Group interaction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual . These mean-ings are incorporated into his personality . The human being at birth is very plastic and can develop in many directions , depending upon the cultural setting . Each society takes certain culture patterns as the norm and directs the socialization of its members accordingly ) . In the present chapter , we shall examine some of these cultural aspects of personality . In this analysis , we shall be concerned with " what happens to per-sonality by virtue of an individual 's membership in enduring groups whose members follow socially standardized ways of acting , thinking , and feeling . " 2 201 // Personality takes shape under the impact of socialization in a par-ticular cultural environment . In this process , social approval goes to the child who follows the accepted culture patterns , and disapproval goes to the child who does not . Every society makes conformists of its members , since nonconformity is difficult and sometimes dangerous . The child begins to conform at an early age and , by so doing , increases pleasure , minimizes anxiety , and generally makes life easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world first from his mother and later from others . By following these expecta-tions , he gains the love of those persons who are important to him and thereby enhances his own security.3 This does not mean that the child is the passive recipient of cultural influences . Nor does it mean that the culture places a uniform stamp upon each personality . The relationship is much more complicated . Individuals differ in intellectual endowment , temperament , and phys-ical characteristics . Furthermore , each group has its unique interaction and its own interpretation of the culture and the many culture patterns . The latter also vary between social classes and subcultures . Each individual , therefore , has a unique biological equipment and a unique his-tory of social interaction . Despite this fact of individual personality , certain uniformities remain between persons who participate in the same culture . These uniformities are the basis for the scientific study of culture and personality.4 Culture and personality are not two separate and independent en-tities , but are in reality two aspects of the same thing . They are part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment , their social groups , and themselves . This relationship between culture and personality is dramatized by the de-scription of culture in personality , rather than culture and personality . In the words of one anthropologist : " Personality and culture . . . are not different or mutually exclusive entities ; they are part and parcel of the same process of interaction . Both personality and culture reside in the individual or , to put it differently , they are the individual as modi-fied by learning . " 5 Each individual interacts with other enculturated individuals from the moment of birth . In this process , each acquires // a personality . The particular version of personality is thus a ( partial ) product of the cultural influences upon the individual . In each society , the problems of socialization are different . Some societies are easier to adjust to than others , for the demands that the culture places upon the individual vary . Each society has a unique historical development , set of institutions , and pattern of cultural roles . The emotional problems of meeting these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic society than in a simple and static one . In our own society , these demands are often both exacting and inconsistent . In the present chapter , we shall contrast different societies with our own in terms of the emotional demands they make upon the members to conform . Each society exacts a minimum of con formity upon its members , but the difficulty of socialization varies with the nature of the culture.6 CULTURE AND BASIC PERSONALITY TYPE Culture presents uniformities that affect the behavior of the members of a society . We are interested in the broad cultural uniformi ties , rather than in the individual differences in personality . Members of the same society have many elements in common that distinguish them from members of other societies . These constitute the communal determinants of personality that we considered in the preceding chap-ter . Such determinants range in importance from matters of etiquette to attitudes toward society and the universe . The way children are reared in the family is an important such personality determinant . A society that enforces a general code of severity will produce one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child will pro-duce another . These and many other elements comprise a pattern that has been called the " basic personality type " for a particular society . ' The basic personality type is a product of socialization as it is con-ducted in a particular society . The central forum of this process is the family . The cluster of roles making up the family are perhaps the most powerful that the individual will encounter during his life . His own personality , furthermore , is at its most plastic during his early family relationship . This combination of demanding roles and infant plasticity gives rise to the similarities included in the basic personality type . In // Parsons ' words , basic personality is " a function of socialization in a particular type of system of role relationships with particular values . " 8 The basic personality type is not a rigid norm , but rather a general pattern of belief and behavior toward which members of a society tend to gravitate . The basic personality type in the United States differs from that in France , Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The person reared in American society has cultural values and under-standings that distinguish him from the person reared in a society with a different pattern of norms and expectations . Differences also exist within the same society , based upon class , caste , religion , or economic status . But all the members of the same society are exposed to certain typical cultural experiences that produce broad similarities in personal-ity . As formulated by Linton , " the fact that personality norms differ for different societies can be explained on the basis of the different experience which the members of such societies acquire from contact with their cultures . " 9 These uniformities are especially apparent among small , isolated , primitive societies , whose cultures are homogeneous and where the individual is ordinarily exposed to a single basic personality pattern . In a large and heterogeneous society , the situation is more complicated , with various subcultures adding their distinctive definitions to the over-all culture . The personality of the American Negro , for example , is different from that of the white person in many respects , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inconsistencies that are largely unknown to the white man . Prejudice and discrimination to-ward the Negro vary between sections and between social classes . The over-all impact of these attitudes of white society is important in set-ting the basic pattern for the Negro personality.10 In spite of these and other variations in a complex society , certain fundamental uniformities still exist . These uniformities make Americans what they are , despite differences in race , creed , or social status . The most important single determinant of the basic personality type in any society is the set of culturally determined patterns for dealing with the child . The socialization of children is a process of learning the acceptable cultural adjustments . The family hands on to the child the patterns of the culture as it ( the family ) understands them , and in this way teaches the child to cope with the physical and the social // world.11 In a society where the mother cares for the child with gentle kindness , the latter will tend to grow up with a different basic per sonality than in a society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating habits , toilet-training , physical punishment , sexual development , personal aggression , control of basic impulses , and emo tional responses , the family interprets the general culture patterns to the receptive child.12 The basic personality type reflects the impact of culture in several ways : ( a ) content ? the actual behavior patterns handed down to the child are the most obvious way in which each culture forms a basic personality type ; ( b ) interpretation ? the adult who transmits the pattern determines the way in which the child will interpret both his own behavior and that of others ; and ( c ) organization ? the culture deter-mines the way learned behavior is organized and the form it takes in the mind of the child . In our own society , much of this learning occurs through the mother , and the moral judgments subsequently reflect , consciously or unconsciously , the image of the mother.13 In many respects , the basic personality type constitutes the funda mental pattern of the adult personality . The personality is , of course , subject to elaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until the end of life . At the same time , experiences that happen to the child in his early years are important to his personality , and these happenings have a basic similarity within each society . This is the period when the " patterning " of personality is most apparent . Patterning is an active verb that indicates " the process , originating with a . group or a community , whereby an individual 's personality is modi fied , limited , or standardized . " 14 Each society has its own way in which this standardization occurs during the early years of life . CULTURE AND THE NORMAL PERSONALITY Society thus singles out certain general patterns for its members from all the possible forms of behavior . In this way , it sets the stand ards for normal and abnormal conduct ; these standards vary between // periods and between societies . Behavior defined as " normal " in one society is " abnormal " in another . Acceptance in the culture patterns , as in the mores , can make almost anything right.15 A given act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the course of history , practically every form of behavior that we now consider abnormal has been accepted by some society as both normal and desirable . Every society makes its own norms , and personality at any time reflects these norms . The sociological definition of normality recognizes this wide range of behavior . This definition is a statistical one , in which the normal is equal to the most usual or the most frequent in a given society at a given time . The " normal " personality does not depart drastically or consistently from the behavior of the majority of persons living under similar cultural conditions . Society is vitally concerned with " normal ity " in this sense , and the process of socialization is directed toward this end . The group requires members whose behavior can be relied upon , not only in emergencies but even more in the day-to-day activities of the group . Social interaction , as we have seen , is based upon this ele ment of predictability in the individual . From the intimate small group of the family to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " normal " personality is the one whose activities are reliable and predictable . The concepts of status and role further suggest the implications of this approach to personality . In the process of social interaction , the behavior appropriate to a particular status emerges in the form of a role . The normal person is the one who plays the roles that his group considers appropriate for him . He does what is expected of him and his conduct can therefore be relied upon . His self-attitudes and the attitudes of others toward him are substantially in accord . Each indi vidual lives through his relationships with others ; if these relationships are distorted , interrupted , or disorganized , his personality will suffer.16 The functional relationship between culture and the normal per sonality may be clearly seen in the case of the psychotic ( " insane " ) person . The latter lives in a world of his own , a world different from that of normal men and women . He may suffer from persistent delu sions of grandeur , in which he imagines himself to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , his own conception of his // role conflicts with that held by others , and the normal cultural expec tations no longer apply for him . He is unable to take the role of others toward himself , and his interpersonal relations may break down com pletely . In this case , he suffers from acute social isolation , which is in itself an " abnormal " condition.17 Other forms of departure from the norm are not so striking . Many persons depart from conventional group expectations in one respect or another . Some of these eccentricities are tolerated , especially in large cities , where such individuals can find kindred spirits . Such behavior may be considered bizarre , but not sufficiently abnormal for the person to be ostracized , incarcerated , or executed . Only those individuals who consistently and spectacularly run counter to organized group expecta tions are defined as abnormal . The great majority follow the expected patterns and are therefore adjudged normal persons . The concept of deviance is useful in considering the relationship between culture and the normal personality . The deviant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior therefore can not be adequately predicted . His departure from conventional expectations may reflect a variety of factors , ranging from ignorance of the nature of the norm , through boredom with the constraint exerted by the norm , to a deliberate desire to advance his own interests at the expense of the group . All societies face the problem of deviance , from the small and homogeneous society of the Trobriand Islands 18 to the large and heterogeneous society of the United States.19 The degree of deviance , however , varies widely between societies , with our own offering a spec tacular example of large-scale deviance in many respects . The deviant in our society violates group norms with respect to such behavior as sexual acts , attitudes toward property , family relationships , religious observances , respect for human life , and governmental loyalty . The prostitute , the criminal , the bigamist , the murderer , and the revo lutionary are among the deviants known to modern society . These per-sons are by no means " insane , " in the sense that they are cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or more important group norms and hence are considered as deviants 20 // Society can tolerate a certain amount of deviation in its members , although such behavior is ordinarily viewed with suspicion . In a small group , the members may attempt to bring the erring brother back into line by increasing their interaction with him and thus pointing out the error of his ways.21 If persuasion fails , the group may curtail its rela tionships with the deviant , in ways ranging from avoidance to ostra cism or even banishment . In extreme cases , such as those involving murder , incest , treason , or offenses against the Gods , the larger society may punish the deviant by death.22 Depending upon the importance of the norm , society has a number of devices for maintaining conformity in its members . The normal person is also one who maintains close and intimate social contact with others . We shall consider the problem of communi cation more fully later in this chapter . We wish merely to indicate here that communication is an important criterion of the normal personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful symbols that make up the communication system of his society . Interruptions or distortions in this process suggest the abnormal personality , for the individual is unable to participate in social interaction . Communication may be interrupted by anxiety , fear , inadequacy , or other emotional states . Whatever the cause , interpersonal relationships have wholly or partially broken down . When this interruption reaches its height , the individual retires to a world of his own and is thereby judged insane.23 This general concept of normality has been challenged by Fromm in his analysis of mental health in its social setting . He maintains that the society itself may be " sick " and that persons who are adjusted to its demands may be correspondingly " sick " ( that is , abnormal ) .24 He further states that there are certain " universals " of mental health in all societies , and that persons who have these qualities are healthy no matter what the reaction of others may be . He says : 25 Mental health is characterized by the ability to love and to create , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a sense of identity based // on one 's experience of self as the subject and agent of one 's powers , by the grasp of reality inside and outside of ourselves , that is , by the development of objectivity and reason . This position has considerable validity if we accept the thesis that there are supersocial criteria for mental normality and abnormality , and that an entire society may be " sick . " In the present state of knowledge , however , this assumption presents certain difficulties . Furthermore , comparatively few persons can view behavior in these universal terms ; the great majority will continue to define behavior in terms of their own culture , assuming that a person who plays his assigned roles is " normal " and that the one who departs from these patterns is " abnor mal . " The person will tend to reflect the appraisals of others toward himself in the same terms . Individual and social judgments ordinarily have no other operating bases than those of the existing culture . CULTURAL VARIATION AND PERSONALITY Personality is therefore considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standards of a particular culture at a particular time . The variations between cultures are so great that it is difficult ( if not impossible ) to find a consistent pattern of personality that would be normal in all societies at all times . Sapir has commented upon this relative conception of normal behavior by pointing out that the " norm " is extremely elastic and that one of the principal functions of the study of man is to underscore this fact . Furthermore , he indi cates , " personalities are not conditioned by a generalized process of adjustment to the normal ' but by the necessity of adjustment to the greatest possible variety of idea patterns and action patterns according to the accidents of birth and geography . " 26 The " normal " individual is the one who lives in Rome and does as the other Romans do . The definition of abnormality ( like that of normality ) differs from one society to another , and behavior defined as abnormal in one may not be so regarded in another.27 In terms of sexual deviation , epilepsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , individuals have made adequate and even highly satisfactory adjustments to some societies , despite the fact that this behavior is considered abnormal in // our own . We may briefly explore some of these situations by way of indicating the elasticity of the " normal . " Cultural norms and sexual abnormality . In our society , normal sexual relations are by definition those between adult members of the opposite sex . The homosexual is a social outcast , and is the subject of mingled derision , scorn , and pity . He fails to carry out the role expecta tions of his sex , and hence is regarded as a deviant and undesirable person . his deviation is viewed as a menace to the organized expecta tions of society , and every effort is made to eliminate , or at least min imize , his behavior . Such fragmentary evidence as we have suggests that homosexual behavior is considerably more widespread in our so ciety than most persons would like to admit . " Despite ( or perhaps because of ) this fact , homosexuality is a deviation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all societies . In the Athens of Pericles , this form of sexual behavior was widely practiced and had widespread social acceptance among the upper classes . In certain con-temporary primitive societies , the homosexual is regarded with a sort of veneration , as constituting a link between the natural and the super-natural , the normal and the divinely abnormal . In these societies , he is often given the status of shaman or religious leader . At some time in his life , the future shaman apparently undergoes a religious trans-formation , when he communes with the spirits and simultaneously changes his sex . Homosexuality is not the norm in these societies , but still it is not viewed with the same horrified distaste as in our own . Norms of sexual conduct are in part culturally defined , with different norms evoking different behavior.29 Cultural norms and social withdrawal . Complete social with drawal is regarded in our society as a personal tragedy . This condition arises from a breakdown in communication between the individual and the group . The self-absorption demanded by Buddhistic religious train ing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most un fortunate of all roles . The candidate is trained to remove himself as completely as possible from other persons , not in the physical sense of withdrawal but in the mental sense of losing himself in a trance-like state . In our society , such a condition is defined as pathological , whereas in India it is widely regarded as an enviable and holy state.3 ' // A similar disparity of definition is seen in our own society at different times . In the Middle Ages , the self-imposed isolation of the saint was viewed with great veneration . Saint Simeon Stylites spent twenty years perched high upon a pillar , where his contemplation of the eternal truths was uninterrupted by any mundane considerations . Saint Francis of Assisi gave away all his worldly possessions and dedicated himself to a life of renunciation . Thousands of ordinary persons took the mo nastic vows of poverty , chastity , and obedience and devoted their lives to meditation and good works . The behavior of the saint would at the present time be considered as definitely abnormal . In terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one epoch to another.31 3 . Cultural norms and personal delusions . In our society there is supposed to be a reasonable consistency between the role a person conceives himself as playing and that which he actually plays . When the discrepancy between these roles becomes too glaring , the person is considered dangerous to ordered social relationships . Persistent de lusions of grandeur are symptoms of personal abnormality , although they may not have the same significance in societies with different norms . Similarly , men who identify themselves with the winds , the heavens , and the mountains are adjudged candidates for mental hos pitals in the United States.32 Among certain tribes of Northwest Coast Indians , however , similar delusions constitute normal behavior for the chiefs , who are considered by themselves and others as very great men . These chiefs devote long and eloquent speeches to the glorification of themselves and their prowess , in which they try to leave no doubt in the minds of the listen ers as to their superhuman powers . The oratory that resounds about the banquet halls of these chieftains would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental hospitals , where the less violent psychotics are allowed to exchange experiences . The chiefs may or may not be convinced of the truth of their own claims to grandeur . The point is that any person in our society who speaks of himself in such consist ently grandiose terms is mentally suspect.33 // CULTURAL PARTICIPATION AND PERSONALITY The average person is in constant communication with others . Serious interruptions in this process are injurious to personality . Man must continually renew his social relationships if he is to continue as an adequate member of society . The importance of cultural participa tion has been recognized by Harry Stack Sullivan , who based his theory of personality and psychiatry upon it . He says , 34 The operational approach to psychiatry . . . rests on the propositions that : ( 1 ) a large part of mental disorder results from and is perpetuated by inadequate communication , the communicative process being interfered with by anxiety ; and ( 2 ) each person in any two-person relationship is involved as a portion of an interpersonal field , rather than as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by the field . We may indicate some of the ways in which inadequate communica tion impairs cultural participation and hence the personality . 1 . Mental deficiency and communication . Personality grows through participation in symbolic communication . A minimum of hereditary mental ability is necessary for such participation . Different levels of mental ability allow varying degrees of participation : ( a ) The moron is slightly below " normal " in intelligence and is handicapped only in the more subtle shades of meaning and in situations involving complex personal adjustments . Morons can play fairly adequate roles in many simple situations and can function adequately under circumstances where the difficulty of choice is not great . ( b ) The imbecile is incapa ble of playing a normal role in the group , although he can care for his own rudimentary bodily needs . His mental age remains on the level of a child of three to seven years , which means that he is unable to grasp any but the simplest symbolic meanings . ( c ) The idiot can not even play a minimum role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three years and will never advance further . He is apparently unable to take the role of the other in any but the simplest relationships , and the role of the generalized other is altogether beyond his powers . The idiot is scarcely a human being in any recognizable sense , and his per sonality remains on the most elementary level . The nature of the social environment is also a determinant of " nor mal " personality development . Some environments are more complex than others and require a correspondingly higher mental complement . The moron may make a satisfactory adjustment to a simple environPERSONALITY // ment . As long as he stays there , he is all right . When some external crisis , such as a war , dislodges him from his familiar surroundings , he may be unable to adjust . Isolation from cultural participation is thus a matter of degree . The person who is " normal " ( adequately adjusted ) in one environment may be " abnormal " ( maladjusted ) in another . The relationship between personality , mental deficiency , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formerly assumed that the inability to communicate and otherwise display normal mental powers was solely due to heredity , and that nothing whatever could be done about it . Recent research has indicated that the ability to com municate and play an adequate role in the group may be developed to a certain extent by training and other environmental ( cultural ) factors . This improvement applies primarily to persons defined as morons , rather than to those of lower mental powers . In a number of studies , persons formerly adjudged to be feeble-minded developed considerably in mental ability when given sympathy , understanding , and adequate training . " 2 . Mental derangement and communication . Mental derangement is the impairment of a hitherto normal mind by physical or social factors . The mentally deranged person is unable to maintain meaningful con-tact with other members of the group . His world is also marked by social isolation , although in a different sense from that of the mentally deficient . The psychotic ( mentally deranged ) person continues to use the words he learned in his personality development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing to him as to the normal person . We can not consider here the processes whereby this progressive isola tion takes place . Suffice it to state that the most common forms of mental derangement are characterized by a high degree of social isolation . " In a recent study , the nature of this isolation was suggested in a : lumber of ways . In sections of the large city having unusually high rates of schizophrenia , various indices of social isolation were found . Among these indices were : the names of fewer neighbors were known ; fewer personal friends and acquaintances were had ; more homes were rented than owned ; there was less membership in such secondary groups as lodges or fraternal organizations , a higher degree of unem employment , and a higher job turnover ; fewer contacts outside of the // local area were had ; and fewer visits were made with friends . In these and other ways , persons living in areas with high rates of schizophrenia indicated that their cultural participation is less intensive than that of persons in areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental disorders in New Haven , Connecticut , there emerged a definite connection between sociocultural environment and the incidence of different types of mental difficulty . In the areas where the lowest class lived , the rate of schizophrenia was eleven times as high as in the areas inhabited by the highest class . The latter , on the other hand , were more prone to neurotic disorders than were the mem bers of the lower classes . In short , " the neuroses are concentrated at the higher levels and the psychoses at the lower end of the class struc ture. " 38 The assumption is that there is a pronounced difference in social isolation between the different areas . Members of the lower class are thus ( presumably ) more isolated from cultural contacts than the upper classes . Whatever the explanation for the differential rate of mental disorders in the various areas , the existence of these differences is clearly demonstrated . Social isolation appears to work reciprocally with schizophrenia . Many of the original symptoms of the disease reflect the initial isola tion of the person from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develops inadequacies in his social relationships , first in his family and later in his peer groups . As he grows older , these symptoms further alienate him from other persons . The lack of cultural participa tion is thus accentuated by the evolving nature of the mental difficulty itself . His personality becomes increasingly abnormal as the barrier widens between himself and others . In other words , " social isolation is . . . a sign that the individual 's interpersonal difficulties have be-come so great that he is no longer capable of functioning in interper sonal relationships . " 39 3 . Racial factors in communication . Difficulties in communication may finally involve the interruption of cultural participation without physical or mental impairment . These difficulties pertain to large seg ments of the population whose complete participation in the culture is frustrated by ethnic background , religious discrimination , poverty , // unemployment , excessive mobility , or forms of deviant status such as that of criminals and prostitutes . The most important barrier to cul tural participation in our society , however , is race . Racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereby inter fere with the cultural participation of the minority group . The result of this barrier to communication is apparent in the per sonalities of sixteen million Negroes in the United States . Skin color deprives 10 per cent of the population of their proportionate share in the cultural heritage , irrespective of their individual abilities . These deprivations range all the way from the elementary right to the safety and security of the person to the right to practice a profession and hold office . These discriminations vary from one section to another , but even in the North there are differences in housing , employment , social and religious activities , and political behavior . Only in public educa tion does the Negro in the North approach equality with the white.40 In other sections of the country , the Negro is subject to various bar riers to cultural participation . He is handicapped by unequal educa tional facilities ; discrimination in public and private schools ; housing restrictions ; restricted rights to health services ; segregation in public transportation ; limited access to many forms of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships . Recent decisions of the Supreme Court have declared many of these forms of discrim ination unconstitutional , but they nevertheless continue to exist vir tually without change in many areas . As a result , the Negro personality suffers from a feeling of rejection by the society as a whole . Insecurity and self-hatred are personality attributes of many Negroes that can be attributed to their minority status.41 CULTURAL CONFLICT AND PERSONALITY The individual in our society is subject to conflicting cultural expectations . Some groups expect him to act in one way , others in another . His family may have one set of expectations while his school , his church , and his business have others . In some respects , these expec tations coincide ; all , for example , will agree on the sanctity of private property . But in many other respects they may disagree ; the church may emphasize spiritual values above those of the market place , at // the same time that business is organized about monetary values . Many other contradictions mark the pattern of American culture . The indi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his personality . Most people are able to reconcile these conflicting expectations ? some are not.42 Personality conflict takes a variety of forms . Even among those who conform to the customary patterns in every important respect , some conflicts are apparent . The individual need not be a deviant to be confused . Many of his personality difficulties arise because he has absorbed the values of his culture too well . His confusion reflects the inconsistency of the culture , not any weakness or incapacity on his part . Some of the values of our culture are clearly incompatible . The individual who accepts all of them with equal emphasis may be in a state of permanent confusion.43 Personality conflict thus reflects cultural inconsistency . Cultures with glaring contradictions produce more than their share of personality difficulties . Families whose wants are indefinitely stimulated by adver tising but whose purchasing power is limited meet one form of cultural contradiction . Women brought up with the belief that their place is in the home may find the role adjustment difficult when they are forced to go to work to supplement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the democratic creed of freedom and equality for all may suffer a rude shock when they are confronted with prejudice and discrimination . The culture of the United States is subject to many such contradictions.44 Personality difficulties of this type are more prevalent in dynamic , heterogeneous societies than in comparatively static , homogeneous so cieties . In the latter , the ideal personality type is easier to attain . The standards of personality are , furthermore , relatively stable and the individual is trained to play a role that will in all probability remain the same throughout his lifetime . In our society , the individual is ex pected to rise in the social scale and thereby achieve a higher status than his father . In a simple and homogeneous society , the individual aspires to be like his parents , to carry on their status , and to deviate as little as // possible from their way of life . These two forms of society ? the one relentlessly dynamic and the other placidly static ? are reflected in the corresponding stability of the personality . We have irrevocably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society reflect this choice.45 In a dynamic society , the culture prescribes certain roles and goals but at the same time fails to make it possible for many persons to attain them . An example of this disparity arises when the individual is unable to become economically self-sufficient , despite the cultural expectation that he do so . Other conflicts arise where the individual is called upon to play two or more contradictory roles . He is expected to compete aggressively and at the same time practice Christian humility toward his fellow men . He is told that he is free to do as he pleases , but at the same time is dependent upon his job . He is taught to value affec tion above all other things , but is often deprived of this affection.46 He is encouraged to participate fully in a democratic culture , but he is handicapped by racial , ethnic , and religious barriers . The majority of persons are able to overcome these and other con flicting patterns . They are able to adjust to modern society , with all its frustrations , inconsistencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " normal " persons , whose behavior approximates the cultural expectations . Others are not so fortunate . They are the mal adjusted , the neurotics , and the psychotics . They have apparently " ex perienced the culturally determined difficulties in an accentuated form , mostly through the medium of childhood experiences , and . . . have consequently been unable to solve them , or . . . solved them at great cost to their personality . " These unhappy persons are numbered in the millions . They are the " stepchildren of our culture . " 47 The middle class in our society seems to have a disproportionate number of these " stepchildren . " The evidence suggests that cultural inconsistencies are mirrored in the personalities of the middle class ( broadly defined ) , rather than the lower classes . In summarizing a number of studies of the relationship between personality difficulties and culture , Cattell states : 48 // The brunt of new inhibitory demands , of new stresses . . . in the develop ing culture pattern , is borne by the middle classes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . . . grips the middle class most inexorably , producing both the traits of neuroticism and insecurity . . . . The members of the middle class seem to feel more acutely than others the contradictions resulting from cultural and social change . ' a Efforts are currently being made to adjust the individual to the expectations of his culture and vice versa . Until recently , the person who was unable to live up to these expectations was considered bi ologically inadequate and ( perhaps ) even morally unsatisfactory . The treatment of the maladjusted person was based upon the assumption that he should be fitted to his social role and his personality should somehow be adjusted to the traditional pattern . Charity followed this general point of view , as did the early practice of social work . More recently , the relationships of culture and personality have become more clearly understood . Social roles are coming to be viewed as cultural products and not as divine pronouncements.5o The luminous conception has thus crept into social thinking that the social roles themselves may be changed , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health insurance , old age pensions , mothers ' aid , and public housing are some of the techniques whereby the indi vidual is enabled , on a large scale , to carry on his economic and social roles more adequately . These efforts are in their infancy and many persons will continue to be frustrated by the failure to fulfill the expec tations of their culture . Social engineering of this kind will doubtless take many hitherto unexpected forms . As the opportunities for the individual to attain the goals of our society are increased by such means , the maladjustments of personality arising from role failure may be expected to decrease.51 In the present chapter , we have explored some of the communal aspects of personality . These aspects derive in large part from the culture that the individual shares with the other members of the so ciety . We have considered the basic personality type as one approach to the cultural aspects of personality , stressing as it does the similarities of methods of child rearing and attitudes toward the child within the same society . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviance , as these judgments reflect the cultural setting . Barriers to participation because of impairments in communication were also briefly considered . The impact of the culture upon the per sonality with respect to the conflicting expectations placed upon the individual was our final concern . In its " normal " as well as its " abnor mal " aspects , personality is the reflection of culture . // POPULATION AND SOCIETY Society is composed of people in interaction , and culture is developed and transmitted by the same process . The two basic concepts of this book thus rest uponTopulation2 the elemental raw material of society . The study of population deals with such matters as the number of people , the dynamics of human growth , the birth and death rates , age and sex composition , and social mobility . We can not consider these matters in detail , but we shall indicate some of the implications of population as they apply to society and culture . Society is directly affected by the growth , composition , and distribution of population . The cultural products of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The central fact of human life is procreation . The extent to which . 223 // procreation is exercised in a given society is called the fertility of the o ulation . This concept is contrasted with fecundity , the biological ability of the human female to reproduce . These concepts are by no means synonymous , and fecundity is everywhere limited by various factors . Most of these limiting factors are cultural , rather than biolog-ical , and fertility is therefore a reflection of the culture . Among the cultural factors are the state of the technology , the standard of living , the attitudes toward marriage and the family , the value placed upon children , and religious definitions . ' The close relationship between population and society goes back to ancient times . The physical safety ? even the survival ? of a given tribe or people was directly related to its numbers . Every man was a poten-tial fighter , and the group with the largest number of able-bodied men was in a favorable position in the struggle for survival . The ancient Hebrews provided the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is no accident that the admonition to be " fruitful and multiply " was part of the doctrine of a people living precariously among hostile nations . Every additional Hebrew was one more man to bear arms or one more woman to bear children . Certain general relationships between population and social struc-ture emerge . Population affects the structure of the society and vice versa . Among these relationships are the following .2 Technological factors . There is a close relationship between the stage of technology and the numbers of the population . Such major technological advances as the " invention " of agriculture and the steam engine have played a central role in population growth . In general , these great advances have meant that a smaller number of people can produce the raw materials necessary to support the rest of the popula-tion . A spectacular growth in world population has resulted from tech-nological advancement , although in the advanced industrial countries this growth is slowly leveling off . Both in terms of past development and future trends , technology and population are closely related.3 Rural-urban factors . Large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and under rural conditions . Sons and daughters are economic and social assets , since they provide the free labor of the household economy and serve as symbols of status for the family . When modern sanitation and medicine ( technological factors ) are introduced to colonial and predominantly rural peoples , the immediate result is a rapid increase in population . High birth rates continue and death rates are drastically reduced . These technological innovations in turn bring about literally revolutionary changes in the productive relationships and social structure of the formerly undeveloped societies . ' Traditional factors . In societies where social control is still largely vested in the mores , the birth rate is traditionally high and the ideal family is usually a large one . This is the society which Riesman has called " tradition-directed , " where the members of the group are moti-vated to follow exactly in the footsteps of their ancestors , and the per-petuation of the species is virtually synonymous with the perpetuation of group sanctions . ' In societies of this type , the stage of technolog-ical knowledge is usually low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The society is thus engaged in a constant struggle for physical survival . Secular factors . The gradual decline in traditional and sacred elements in a society is followed by an increase in the rational and secular elements . Social change is no longer feared in these societies and comes to be accepted , first as inevitable and then as desirable.6 Secular societies often encourage the artificial limitation of population and move toward a stabilization of growth . Among the general char-acteristics of secular societies are " education , city life , industrial em-ployment , employment of women outside the home in non-agricultural occupations , revolutionary social movements , popular participation in democratic processes , the spread of inventions , and the advance of science . " ' 5 . Planning factors . A final relationship between population and so-ciety is the degree of social planning and the prevailing attitude in the society toward the purposeful direction of human affairs . Social control of population growth is one of the most difficult forms of social plan226 POPULATION ping . Cultural and social factors combine to make any deliberate change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a simple individual response to a biological urge ; it is deeply imbedded in the culture pattern and can not be changed without extensive modifications in the pattern.8 Efforts by governmen tal or other agencies either to increase or to limit family size have not been notably successful . The relationships between population and society are of direct or indirect concern to persons in a wide variety of roles . The soldier , minister , priest , politician , educator , physician , business man , and en gineer concern themselves in one way or another with the quantity , quality , composition , distribution , and control of population . These persons often ignore or minimize the social and cultural factors in the population equation . They tend to regard man in a segmental ( partial ) role as soldier , communicant , or customer , rather than in his full capac ity in all of these roles and many more . POPULATION AND WORLD TRENDS The growth of population was infinitely slow throughout most of the life of man as a differentiated species . This growth was handi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hun dreds of thousands of years of the Paleolithic ( Old Stone Age ) were apparently marked by small population groups , miserably attempting to wrest a bare living from a hostile environment . The Neolithic Revo lution marked the first time that the human species reached a stage in cultural evolution where an increase in population was possible . The discovery of agriculture , the domestication of animals , and the inven tion of pottery and textiles were among the factors that combined to bring about a greater density of population in the Neolithic ( New Stone Age ) . From that time on , the rate of cultural evolution and the complexity of the culture base slowly increased , giving man a greater control over his environment and a corresponding increase in numbers.9 The rate of population growth was still comparatively slow until approximately 300 years ago . In the year 1650 , there were perhaps 500 million people in the world , as compared to an estimated two and one-half billion in 1950 . In the last three centuries , the population of the // world thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been greater in the last 150 years than in the first 150 years of this span . In the century 1650 to 1750 , the annual rate of growth was about four per 1,000 population ; in the second century , 1750 to 1850 , it rose to five per 1,000 population ; in the century from 1850 to 1950 , the rate increased to eight per 1,000 population . In the thirty years from 1920 to 1950 , the rate of growth was nine per 1,000 population , almost 1 per cent per year.l ? The recent growth of world population has been uneven , with some continental areas showing rapid proportional increases ( Europe ) ; oth ers showing great absolute increases ( Asia ) ; others increasing both pro portionately and absolutely ( North America ) ; and others increasing relatively slowly ( Africa ) . " In the three hundred years from 1650 to 1950 , North America 's population increased 166 times ; Latin America , twenty-three times ; Oceania , six and one-half times ; Europe ( including the Soviet Union ) , six times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere two times.12 In approximately the last century and a half ( 1800 to 1946 ) , Europe increased from 188 million to 533 million ; North America , from 15 million to 203 million ; Asia , from 600 million to 1,199 million ; and Africa , from 100 million to 173 million.13 These figures are estimates , since accurate figures are still lacking for such great masses of popula tion as India and China , not to mention other population groups in Oceania and Africa . Whatever the actual figures , experts believe that a similar rate of growth will never occur again over a comparable period.14 The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw the rise and ex pansion of the Industrial Revolution , basic modifications in farming throughout a large part of the world , tremendous improvements in hygiene and sanitation that cut the adult death rate , and great strides in medicine that lowered the infant mortality rate . These and other factors contributed to the above increase in world population , a trend that was hardly slowed by wars , epidemics , and contraception . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in industrial tech nology , business relationships , agricultural methods , political organiza tion , transportation , and communication such as it had never undergone in all its previous history . One of the accompaniments of this series of events was a rise in population beyond anything before imagined . This increase led to changes in the social structure of Western Europe and America . The most spectacular single manifestation of this growth was the rise of new cities and the expansion of those already existing . The invention of the steam engine made it possible for millions of persons to live and work in a single urban center . The form and structure of the family underwent a change : more and more persons were crowded into small urban apartments ; the number of children decreased ; and changes occurred in the functions that had formerly been performed by the family . The other institutions began to assume an increasingly urban and secular aspect . The burgeoning of the population that had characterized the first century of industrial ization began to slow down . In societies with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the birth rate were progressively lowered.15 The increase in the population of Western Europe during the eight eenth and nineteenth centuries was accompanied by massive overseas migration . The white man moved in large numbers into sections of the world formerly inhabited by other races . This movement intensified consciousness of skin color and other racial differences and gave rise , along with other factors , to the doctrine of racism.16 In their migration to the four corners of the world , the white men also brought their advanced technology and superior medical knowledge . This enabled them to bring about a rapid decrease in the death rate of the colonial peoples by improving sanitation , reducing infant mortality , and estab lishing better transportation.17 The Western culture pattern embodying the limitation of fertility through contraception , however , was received with much less enthusi asm by the ancient societies of the Far East . At the present time , about one-third of the human race has some degree of voluntary control over the size of the family . India and China are not among the peoples who exercise this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth in the proximate future will probably occur in Asia . As one // population expert puts it , " The future of the species may well hinge on how rapidly Asians acquire the small-family patterns now adopted in the West . . . " is The balance of population growth appears to be shifting from Europe and America to the lands bordering on the Pa cific . The social consequences of this trend are incalculable . POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES The history of the United States has been marked by a con stant growth of population . The most spectacular increase reflected the millions of immigrants who came to these shores . More important in the long run , however , was the consistent excess of births over deaths . This situation was facilitated by virtually unlimited natural resources of an undeveloped country , where high fertility responded to the at mosphere of abundance.19 We may examine some of the social and cultural factors that combined to bring about this sustained increase . ' " Land . The land was rich , plentiful , and for generations practically free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic independence encouraged early marriage . Family . Children were an asset on the frontier and continued to be on the farm . Health . Farm dwellers were relatively isolated and hence free from many of the infectious and contagious diseases found in the city . Food . Famine was never remotely probable in a country with such natural resources . Religion . In the early years , the Protestant faith strongly encouraged large families , an attitude heartily seconded by the Roman Catholic faith of the later immigrants . Philosophy . The philosophical outlook and general social attitudes of the American people were optimistic , a factor that led to high fertility . Immigration . More than thirty million immigrants , most of them young adults in the most reproductive years , have come to this country since its founding . Contraception . Contraceptive information was not widely disseminated until recently , and artificial checks on conception have been lacking . Residence . Throughout the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth // centuries , the bulk of the population was rural and followed the tendency I 4 toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of the population of the United States was an answer to these and related factors . The continued prosperity of this country has been closely tied in with the expansion of the domestic market , unin hibited by trade barriers and other internal restrictions . The size of the population is an important economic consideration for the nation as a whole , as well as for the communities comprising it . Every city vies with every other for the title of " biggest and best , " as this increase means higher real estate values , more tax revenue , more voters , and more customers . Those enterprises that manufacture or distribute automobiles , refrig erators , washing machines , and television sets are especially interested in the number of families , since these and other consumer durable goods are ordinarily sold one to a family . The manufacturers and dis tributors of food , clothing , and entertainment likewise welcome a large population , since this means greater profits . Business has been geared to an expanding population in the United States and continues to look to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of population in this country have been spectacular . In the first thirty years of our national existence , from 1790 to 1820 , the population increased by approximately 150 per cent . This rate continued during the decades from 1820 to 1850 . From 1850 to 1880 , the rate declined to 116 per cent , and from 1880 to 1910 it declined still further to 80 per cent . The next thirty years , from 1910 to 1940 , saw the rate of growth further decrease to 43 per cent.22 The basic generalization is , therefore , that the population of this country has continued to grow every generation but at a decreasing rate . In the five-year period from 1950 to 1955 , the population increased by 9.3 per cent , which in terms of 30-year intervals is an increase of approximately 55 per cent . In this half-decade , the various age groups increased at a highly differential rate . Children from five to nine years of age increased by about 30 per cent , or more than three times the average ( 9.3 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ten to fourteen years showed an increase of about 20 per cent , and those of preschool age ( under five years ) increased by 13.2 per cent . These increases point to a crisis in school facilities in the years 1955-1970 , as the wave of children five to nine years old gradually inundates // the school system . First the primary grades , then the secondary schools , and finally by 1965 the colleges and universities will feel the full weight of these massive juvenile forays 23 THE BIRTH RATE The most common measure of the birth rate is the " crude birth rate " that is , the annual number of births per 1,000 of the population . Various refinements have been made upon this concept ? notably the number of births per 1,000 married women of child-bearing age ? but for present purposes the crude birth rate is satisfactory . The birth rate depends upon a variety of factors , among them : The marriage rate . The birth rate is directly related to the mar riage rate , which in turn is dependent upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The age composition . The birth rate is also related to the age composition of the population , that is , whether or not it is predomi nantly a " young " population , with a high proportion of women of child-bearing age . The proportion married . This is not synonymous with the marriage rate ( above ) in any one year , but refers rather to the proportion of women of child-bearing age ( 15 ? 44 years ) who are married . A society with a high proportion of married women in this age group will tend to have a higher crude birth rate than one in which a smaller propor tion of these women is married . The social climate . The birth rate also reflects a complex group of social , cultural , and psychological factors that might be called the " social climate " of fertility . During the decade of the Depression , this climate was conducive to a low birth rate , especially among the classes with the knowledge and ability to limit conception.24 In the fifteen years from 1940 to 1955 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of higher fertility . Accurate data on the birth rate in the United States have been avail-able only since 1933 , when birth registration became effective in all // states . Estimates of the birth rate prior to that time were based upon the number of women and children at the successive ten-year censuses . Such data indicate that the crude birth rate began to decline in the nineteenth century , from an estimated 40.0 per 1,000 population early in that century to approximately 30.0 in 1900 , and culminating in an all-time low point of 16.6 in 1933.25 A decline in the birth rate is not necessarily synonymous with a decline in population , provided the death rate declines more rapidly . This has been the case in the United States , where the population has continued to increase long after the birth rate turned downward , as a result of the continued excess of births over deaths.26 In the late 1930 's , there was a pronounced upturn in the business cycle and the marriage rate , shortly followed by an increase in the birth rate , which rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diate postwar years saw the rate reach 26.6 in 1947 , the highest figure in recent years . In 1952 , the rate was 25.1 and it remained at that figure in 1953 , rising slightly to an estimated 25.3 in 1954 . In the period 1950 through 1954 , a total of 19,415,000 children were born in the United States , the highest number for any similar period in the history of the nation.27 These rapid shifts in the birth rate demonstrate the fluctuations in fertility in response to social and cultural changes . The fecundity of the population ( the biological ability to bear children ) obviously underwent no change whatever during this brief period . This increased fertility was especially marked among women who were 35 years of age and younger in the early 1950 's . On the average , women in this age group showed an increase of more than 50 per cent in number of children ever borne , as compared to women of the same age group in 1940.28 In the four years from 1950 to 1954 , women aged 20 to 24 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smaller proportionate gains were made in the age groups up to 35 years of age , after which little change was evident . Among women 30 to 34 // years of age in 1954 , only 13 per cent of those who had ever married had never borne a child . This was the lowest percentage of childless ness among women of this age in many years.29 These gains in fertility in the early years of the 1950 's reflected the tendency of the average young married woman to have more children than formerly . The increase did not reflect any spectacular rise in the proportion of women married , which remained virtually constant . In this period , the proportion of married women under 35 with only one child was decreasing and , correspondingly , the proportion with more than one child was increasing.30 It remains to be seen whether or not this situation is permanent . On a temporary basis , however , the changes in fertility over a brief period are spectacular . The birth rate in the United States is increasingly subject to volun tary restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , the birth rate reflects changes in attitudes toward children , as well as other factors that comprise the " social climate " of fertility . In the decades immediately prior to World War II , the social climate favored the restriction of fertility , especially among the middle classes . This climate reflected factors as varied as the growing economic burden of children in urban society and the desire to retain youth and beauty as long as possible , even at the expense of children.31 The social climate presumably changed in the period 1940-1955 , and the increased fertility of the urban middle classes was a response to this new sit uation . The general nature of the social climate affecting fertility has been investigated by Whelpton and Kiser in the Indianapolis study , to which we have previously referred.32 This study , however , related to the De pression years , when fertility was widely restricted . The " new " social climate of the 1950 's is the subject of a new and intensive investigation by Mishler and Westoff , also conducted under the auspices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fertility histories of a sample of 1,500 native-white women , residing in the 271 counties defined by the Bureau of the Census as being in the Standard Metropolitan Areas . The basic criterion of the sample is that // each woman shall have given birth to a second child approximately six months before the first interview.33 The central interest of this study of the social climate of fertility is in the various sociopsychological factors responsible for fertility per-formance ? in the present study , the birth of a third child . These factors have been tentatively classified under three headings : Person variables . The first category refers to psychological factors within the parents themselves that reflect their own personality needs . One hypothesis is that " excessive and unsatisfactory needs for emo-tional support from other persons will tend to be incompatible with desires for additional children . " That is , parents who themselves have strong needs for emotional support will presumably have comparatively little desire for the additional emotional complications attending a third child . Another hypothesis is that " personal involvement in or identifica-tion with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further children . " " The role of ( further ) parenthood may thus be less important if the parents are successful in roles outside the family , such as the economic or professional.34 Family group variables . This category attempts to discover the relationship between fertility and the structure of the family group itself . For example , there is the " extent to which the social organization of the family group will be able to absorb adequately the stresses and strains of an additional child . " These variables include the way hus-bands and wives share the burdens of family life , the delegation of responsibility , and the adjustment of the family to its various problems . The hypothesis is that families with a strong organization will , other things being equal , have more children than those with a weak organ-ization.35 Social setting variables . The third group of variables thought to be related to fertility performance involves the social setting of the family in a variety of group contexts . This factor includes such considerations as : " ( a ) the relative benevolence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social settings with which family members are involved ; and ( c ) the degree of control which is available to the family over the type and extent of involvement with its various social settings . " The hypothesis is that families whose members feel secure in their jobs , // their group relationships , their social status , and in the general " benev olence " of their world will be more fertile than those who view their environment with apprehension , anxiety , and hostility.36 THE DEATH RATE The death rate is the other side of the population equation . The death rate measures the extent to which the numbers of the population are subject to the annual attrition of death . The crude death rate is based upon the same conception as the crude birth rate ? namely , the number per 1,000 of the population . The crude death rate is also sub ject to variations reflecting the age composition of the population , with a relatively " old " population tending to have a higher death rate ( other things being equal ) than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflects such factors as sanitation , health , diet , famine , epi demics , and war . Although death must eventually come to all men , the manner and time of its coming are to some extent dependent upon culture and social structure . Population growth depends upon variations in both birth and death rates . If the birth rate is high , the expected rate of population increase may be cut or even turned into a negative figure by an extremely high death rate . If the birth rate is low , population growth may still occur at a relatively rapid rate , provided the death rate is even lower . Nations that have undergone drastic decreases in the death rate and have main tained high birth rates have increased rapidly in population over a comparatively short time . Such a situation is apparent in India , where the death rate has been sharply cut by Western methods of hygiene and sanitation , but where the mores giving rise to high birth rates have remained comparatively untouched.37 In many of the countries of Western Europe , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death rate had begun to decline before there was any significant de-cline in the birth rate . Under such conditions , the population increased rapidly . Throughout most of the history of mankind , the death rate has been very high . A large proportion of all babies died within a few days , weeks , or months of birth . Many of those who survived this early // period subsequently succumbed to such " childhood " diseases as scarlet fever , smallpox , measles , and diphtheria . To these " normal " risks of life were added periodic epidemic visitations of bubonic plague ( " the black death " ) , typhus , or pneumonic plague.38 It is no wonder that the historic death rate was high in terms of modern standards . At the be-ginning of the nineteenth century , the crude death rate in the United States was probably as high as 25.0 per 1,000 of the population , as compared to the current rate of 9.2 ( 1954 ) , which was the lowest ever recorded for this country.39 The difference between a death rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in population during the first half of the decade of the 1950 's . This remarkable decrease in the death rate in the Western countries is the result of an increase in medical knowledge that has probably been greater in the past century than in all previous history combined . The diseases that can be held in check by public health , sanitation , and improved medical knowledge have rapidly decreased in importance as causes of death . Those arising from the degeneration , decline , or decay of the organs of the body have become increasingly important . Medical advancement in certain respects has reduced the death rate almost as low as it can go under present conditions.4 ? With the decrease in the death rate has come an increase in longev ity . This trend is shown graphically in Figure 1 , which depicts the increase in life expectancy of the industrial policyholders of the Metro politan Life Insurance Company . The experience of this company approximates that of the general population of the country . Under conditions of mortality prevailing in 1850 , the expectation of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . In 1954 , the expec tation of life at birth was approximately seventy years . In a century , at least thirty years have thus been added to the expectation of life at birth for the average person . There is a considerable differential here between men and women . In a recent year ( 1952 ) , the expectation of life at birth for white males.was 66.64 years . For females it was 72.65 , or a difference of approximately six years.41 // The reduction in infant mortality has been an important factor in the increase in life expectancy at birth . Improvements in prenatal care , increased medical knowledge , and the growing number of childbirths in hospitals are among the factors that have reduced the hazards of the first year of life . The first figures in the United States for infant mortality were for 1915 ; they showed a rate of 99.9 deaths for every 1,000 live births . In other words , one out of ten children failed to live through their first year , with most of them dying in the first weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55.7 per 1,000 live births and by 1950 it had fallen to 29.2.42 The years 1950-1954 saw a further decrease , with an estimated 26.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1954.43 // It is important to bear in mind the relationship between the increase in longevity and the decrease in infant mortality . The rise in life expect ancy from 40 to 70 years does not mean that persons in middle and later years are living 30 years longer than they did a century ago . It means that persons born today have a better chance of reaching their " allotted " threescore and ten years because their chances of living through the first years of life are much better . As the population grows increasingly older in future decades , the death rate may conceivably rise slightly . A larger proportion will be in the older age groups , where death from the degenerative diseases takes its inexorable toll . The death rate has also been affected by technological and industrial changes , in addition to those in the field of health . The latter were made possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased the standard of living , furnished the resources for public sanitation , and generally made the lot of mankind physically easier . The results of the Industrial Revolution were coupled with those ac cruing from the agricultural revolution , which increased the yield of crops , added to soil fertility , and improved the number and quality of livestock . Technological factors were also apparent in the increased facilities for transportation and communication , which removed the possibility of famine in the Western world . The decline in the death rates during the past century gives witness to the tremendous cultural advances in health and well-being.44 The conditions characteristic of the countries of western Europe as late as the eighteenth century still prevail throughout large sections of the world . Many areas of the Far East , with hundreds of millions of people , are now living under conditions of health , hygiene , and trans portation that give rise to death rates as high as 30.0 per 1,000 of the population . In India , these conditions are already in the process of change , whereas in China improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , a decrease in the death rate would shortly intro-duce a rapid increase in population , unless this decrease were accom panied by a corresponding decrease in the birth rate . Such a decreased fertility in China appears unlikely at the present time.45 // COMPOSITION OF THE POPULATION The composition of the population refers to the different ele-ments comprising the body of the people . Included in this category are age , sex , race , and marital status . We shall consider the population of the United States in terms of these four categories . 1 . Age . We have already mentioned an important aspect of the age composition of the population ? the fact that the American people are growing older . In 1850 , 52.5 per cent of the population were under 20 , as compared to 34.4 per cent in 1940 . The large number of births during the 1940 's and the first half of the 1950 's kept this percentage from declining still further.46 At the other end of the life cycle , the America of 1850 had only 2.6 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent over 65 ; and in 1955 the percentage had increased to 8.6.47 The numerical composition of the population by age , color , and sex is seen in Table 1 . In a century , the United States has thus changed from a young nation to one increasingly middle-aged . The median age of theop-ulation has risen from 22.9 years in 1900 to 30.1 years in 1955 . This means that approximately half of the people are younger than 30.1 years and half are older , with the median at the mid-point in the curve . The proportion over 65 in the population doubled between 1900 and 1955 , from approximately one out of every twenty-five in 1900 to one out of every twelve in 1955 . Only the rapid increase in children under five years in the period 1950 ? 1955 kept the proportion of older persons from rising even higher.48 Students of population trends assumed , until recently , that the trend toward an older population would continue substantially without modi-fication for some decades . This situation would have involved a de-creasing number of children in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-age security . The larger proportion of elders would have had implications for voting strength , ownership of property , and other tangible and intangible factors , with the elders playing an increasingly important role in our society.49
