In another time and climate , Washington 's hoary old dodge-the-blame game might have been amusing . But last week Democrats and Republicans were playing the game for all it was worth over the tragic demise of hardfisted , desperately needed labor legislation . In another part of the capital , Arkansas ' John McClellan and his Senate investigating subcommittee continued to document graft , corruption and outright racketeering that led repeatedly to the nation 's biggest unions , e.g. , the powerful Teamsters , whose boss Jimmy Hoffa is deep in a plan to organize all U.S. transportation . In the face of such evidence there was plenty of blame to dodge as the Senate-passed Kennedy-Ives bill was entombed , apparently for all time , in the House Labor Committee . <P> Labor Secretary James P. Mitchell recalled accurately that the Administration had submitted last January a reasonable , workable program for preventing union abuses , that the Democratic Senate had watered it down , and Republican prodding ( mostly by California 's Bill Knowland ) had put some starch back into it . In the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age on his desk " 40 days and 40 nights " before referring it to the anarchic House Labor Committee , chaired by North Carolina 's molasses-moving Graham Barden . <P> Massachusetts Democrat Jack Kennedy , Senate sponsor ( with New York 's Republican Irving Ives ) snapped back that Mitchell , for all of his ringing statements , had " never lifted a finger " to help get Republican support for the bill . On the other hand , said Kennedy , the National Association of Manufacturers , after discovering features objectionable to management in the bill , had flooded the House with " intemperate , exaggerated and misleading attacks . " Speaker Rayburn chimed in to explain that he sat on the bill 41 days in hope of rounding up votes enough to suspend House rules and bypass Barden 's committee . That gambit failed when the N.A.M . stirred up too many " noes . " <P> N.A.M . surely deserved some blame , but the Democrats would most regret the failure . Labor might be relieved ; " You can say we 're not sorry it failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole had been deeply stirred by McClellan 's revelations of corruption in Big Labor , might at election time wonder why a Democratic-controlled Congress had not done something about it . The man to ask was Democrat Sam Rayburn , 45-year House veteran , who has wielded his gavel too long and ruled the House too well to botch a legislative job accidentally .
