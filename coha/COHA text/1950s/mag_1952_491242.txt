MANILA , PHILIPPINE ISLANDS . OR the prophets , there are just two questions worth answering in the Philippines today . One is , " What excuse will President Quirino find for slicing Ramon Magsaysay 's political throat ? " The alternate reads , " When will Magsaysay cut loose from the president and face publicly the not-unpleasant fact that he is himself the real government of this island republic ? " The answers are important to Americans , no matter how remote and puzzling Philippines politics appear ? the odd names and places , the Balkan-style feuds and muddy issues . Not only did we launch this republic on its erratic course six years ago , we have also kept it running with American billions  --  and in the eyes of Asia , it 's still our big , careening , badly driven machine . Entry into the Korean war appeared necessary to keep all Asia out of communist hands . But an even greater threat to American prestige and friendships in this unhappy corner of the world is concerned with the fate of the Republic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , we can kiss the rest of Asia a not-verylingering good-by . That well-polished term , " show window of democracy , " applies here if anywhere in the world . The structure , even the military insignia and frustrating immigration laws of this nation are modeled on our own . Facing criticism , Filipino officials have produced a stock and painful answer , " Well , we 've had excellent instructors in inefficiency , graft and corruption . Everything we know , we learned from you . " - So this great awkward international baby , this six-year-old boy at the wheel of a hundred-mile-anhour governmental automobile , is our own  --  an ersatz United States , if you like . It constitutes a sad contrast between the ideals of freedom and the seamy underside of independence . It is a demonstration that democracy can be neither imposed nor bestowed , but must be learned , slowly and with bruises . Whatever you call this Philippines nation , we do have to worry about it . He Learned Warfare the Rugged Way S O we must worry also about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big and friendly man who does n't sleep well at night and ca n't keep his feet still under a desk or his shoes on . But he can keep a promise , and does . The Tagalog name , Magsaysay , can be translated as " Explain , explain ! " It 's not a bad fit for the man . The bearer of it is a one-time automobile mechanic from rural Zambales Province on the west coast of Luzon northwest of Manila . Early in World War II , American forces on Bataan commandeered the busses of a transportation company he managed and took him along as a motor-pool officer . When the Bataan army surrendered , Magsaysay slipped away into the Zambales mountains and eventually , as a guerrilla captain , commanded some 12,000 men and took a Japanese airfield . Like other working guerrillas , Magsaysay was chased for four years , learning the hard way about punitive patrols , war dogs and what hurts guerrillas most . Like the rest , Magsaysay ate roast monkey with the mountain tribes when he could get it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " Carabao , " he says , " is all right ; only when you eat it two , three days , by golly , you begin to smell like one . " Late in 1944 an American invasion fleet appeared off the coast of Zambales , ready to bombard the beaches ahead of a landing . In a small boat , Magsaysay got out to the flagship . A staff officer introduced him to the admiral planning the shelling . " They want us not to shell the beaches , " the officer said . " They claim they 've taken care of all the Japs . This is the guerrilla leader ? " Magsaysay said , " Admiral , nobody is left over there but Filipinos . You do n't need to shell those towns . You can land unopposed . I promise . " Dubiously , the admiral did withhold his ships ' fire and troops walked ashore with their rifles under their arms . This big guerrilla in the tattered clothes meant what be said and did what he promised . The pattern was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall appointed Magsaysay as military governor of his home province . He served until the returning Filipino civil government replaced him  --  for reasons obscure to a guerrilla  --  with a man who had helped the Japanese during the occupation . Later , Magsaysay ran for the islands ' congress  --  mainly because he could not stomach the fact that all the other candidates in his province had been collaborators  --  and served two terms . American congressmen became aware of him in 1947 and early 1950 , when he pleaded successfully in Washington for veterans ' benefits for Filipinos and for more military aid to the Philippines . In September , 1950 , President Elpidio Quirino asked him three times to become secretary of national defense in the cabinet . The third time he accepted . A little review is necessary . The Philippines Republic was established July 4 , 1946 , in strict compliance with United States wartime promises of independence . Manuel Quezon , prewar Commonwealth president and " father " of the republic , died before his dream was realized . So his vice-presidentin-exile , Sergio Osmelia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly . The republic had a thousand war-born problems  --  reconstruction , war-crimes trials , some Japanese still in the mountains . In addition , it inherited a batch of very old ones . Three of the most important were land distribution , money and morals . Why the Peasants Took to the Hills T HE land problem dated to Spanish days , when fantastic acreage grants were made to successful soldiers , crown favorites and church orders . These huge estates still existed , with fine Spanish and Filipino families living gracefully in Manila on rentals of estates in Pampanga Province  --  where the estates covered 70 per cent of all the farm land  --  and other provinces . Peasants who worked the land lived all their lives at subsistence level , in debt to the landlords and usurers . Quezon 's commonwealth had made a small land-reform effort , but it had been killed by the war before making any impression on the total problem . Now war-weary peasants demanded their human rights . When they could n't get them , thousands of peasants gave up the fight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Japanese held the towns . The Hukbalahap , communist organization with a name which meant " People 's Army Against Foreign Invaders , " found plenty of recruits and no trouble in making their goal revolution and the communist state . The money problem also was inherited from 300 years of Spanish rule and half a century of Washington domination . In both cases , the Philippines economically had been mere colonies . Home-country businessmen wanted raw materials  --  hemp , sugar , copra and hardwoods ? but were not friendly to colonial industry which would compete with their own . Now the republic was thrown on its own , coincident with the decline of most raw-material exports , and had no local industry to provide the things Filipinos had learned to want or need  --  American automobiles , cigarettes , electric lights , refrigerators , drugs , g phonograph records . Foreign exchange flowed out steadily and the peso sank lower and lower . Only American grants for war damage , veterans ' pensions and upkeep of American forces still in the Islands held national bankruptcy at bay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of farmers selling old eggs ; morals on the streets of Manila , where no American car was safe ; and , more important , morals of government officials from the cabinet down , each getting whatever he could . Graft was the standard order of procedure . Outsiders sometimes wonder why personal and official theft should be so widespread here . The best answer by thoughtful Filipinos again refers to history . This People lived under a Spanish regime so harsh that lYing and stealing were necessary for survival . American rule changed this situation some . But then Caine four years with the Japanese running the islands . Then , to steal was a virtue ; to ambush , an act of bravery ; and to murder , the sign of a patriot . Facing these problems , Osmefia proved to be a fantastically inept administrator with a penchant for bad appointments and delayed decisions . Scrap metal went for little or nothing  --  except in bribes ? and found its way to China , eventually to communist guns shelling Americans and Filipinos in Korea . Taxes went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to officials all along the line . This was the open season on Uncle Sam 's dollars . The Osmefia government " recognized " 350,000 former guerrillas as entitled to American pay  --  although nobody ever saw a full 100,000 in the field . The self-proclaimed fighters for freedom were not even required to turn in the minimum of one rifle or pistol each ? without which they could not have done any real fighting . These guns and the remainder of 600,000 estimated to have been left in the islands at the end of the war became the communists ' arsenal for war in the hills . Osmefia stood for re-election in 1946 . To the astonishment of no Filipinos , he lost to Manuel Roxas , a strong man who had helped the Japanese puppet government . Roxas made a start toward getting some order into the government but died in office before he had done much . He was succeeded by Vice President Quirino , then considered a political nonentity . Bu* Quirino turned out to be a shrewd , crafty politician . He promptly reversed Roxas ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about American interference . Party reorganization made him head of the new and dominant Liberal Party and tagged most of his Nacionalista Party opponents with an anti-American label . One opponent after another found himself suddenly out of a job or , worse , shifted to some backwater where he was politically impotent . By 1949 , Quirino was firmly in the saddle and determined to stay there . In the election of that year , he faced Jos4 Laurel , the controversial political philosopher who once faced treason charges , but has never ceased to maintain he was actually the best friend the Americans and Filipinos had during the war  --  although he served as Japanese puppet premier and declared war on the Allies . His personal popularity has always been great , and many Filipinos accept the theory that he has been a consistent patriot . Quirino could not make collaboration an election issue , because he , too , had served in the puppet government , although his wife and other members of his family were later killed by Japanese marines . The 1949 campaign was a bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballots . Ballot boxes turned up with big votes for one candidate , zeros for the other . Candidates were abducted and shot . The count of dead on election day alone was in the hundreds , with other hundreds vanished during the campaign . The best that could be said for this mess was that some question existed as to which party did the most dirty work . On the official count , Quirino'won . But Laurel never conceded the election , and the Nacionalista Party charged a nationwide election theft . Four defeated Nacionalista candidates for the senate took their cases to court , but still had no decisions by late in 1951 . Meanwhile , the Liberals held the seats . The peso plummeted , black markets flourished and industry from abroad stayed away as from the plague . Philippines ships financed by American funds mysteriously were sold to Poland , and by Poland to Russia . While Filipino soldiers fought in Korea , Russian and Red Chinese ships openly picked up war materials in Manila for use against these same troops . The real crisis came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel W. Bell reported that the Philippines standard of living had fallen below prewar levels , taxes covered less than 60 per cent of government expenditures , and imports far outstripped exports . The collapse of the peso was imminent , governmental corruption and inefficiency were rampant , and communists were making hay . The commission recommended complete revision of the tax structure , land distribution , government reorganization to produce some honesty  --  and American loans and grants of $250,000,000 to prevent total collapse . The report could have gone further . Public services were falling apart . The Manila railroad , a government intercity line on Luzon , ran filthy trains now and then , but had three times as many employees as similar lines in the United States . Schools were political tools . Bus lines operated only if their politics were right  --  if they were , they could put any old piece of death-dealing junk on the road . Government office red tape could be cut only by the judicious application of bribes in the right places . The armed services were the worst of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniformed thieves and rapists , more feared than bandits . A complaint to it by a citizen might get him a beating or , frequently , murder . It gave protection only for a price , and when the constables left their barracks the people , not lawbreakers , had reason to be afraid . The army was little better . Its officers were split between ex-guerrillas and ex-collaborators , with the latter in the top spots . Enlistments were zero . Headquarters reports glowed , but very few bandit corpses ever were displayed . People in the villages , sick of landlords , official thieves and craven troops , gave up the struggle . For them , there was always one out ? " our friends in the hills . " The Hukbalahap had been an unreliable wartime guerrilla organization , preying indiscriminately on Japanese , Filipinos and Americans . But for a while after the peace , leaders went through the motions of co-operating with the republic . Luis Taruc , best-known of them , was even elected to Congress , which refused to seat him . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lava , Guillermo Capadocia , Nicasio Pamintuan , Mariano Balgos and a former American soldier , William Pomeroy , of Rochester , New York , who returned here after the war to join his chums . They gathered an estimated 10,000 men , openly proclaimed themselves communists , set up " Stalin University " in the mountains and used their own crudely printed newspaper , the Titis , to announce the revolution . By 1950 they challenged the government in a dozen provinces . They had help from nearly every barrio and village  --  although apparently none from Russia , in spite of scare stories about Soviet submarines off the coasts . A defeated candidate in the 1949 election admitted recently , " By midsummer of 1950 I could n't see any future for this government .. So I sent word to my friends to start gathering guns . Quite a few others were doing the same thing , and any spark could have set it off . " The Philippine army had less than 18,000 effectives , and the constabulary was unreliable . With 10,000 men in the mountains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform , honest government , decent police and lives free of everlasting debt . Many Filipinos were ready to believe . But this loaded cannon never went off . President Quirino desperately needed somebody to take over the armed forces , someone acceptable to W tshington , which now distrusted his whole government , somebody with a decent war and postwar record . In short , somebody to make his whole government smell just a little better to American and Filipino noses alike . it 's an interesting speculation whether the president would have asked Magsaysay three times , or even once , if he 'd known what he was getting . So far , the president officially has beamed on every act of his prot  --  g ? , even when Magsaysay ran him right off the front pages . But the smile is getting a little fixed and measured recently . At any rate , Magsaysay took the job . To the leader organizing personal forces for a revolt , he said , " Give me ninety days . If I have n't done anything by then , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the generals who had headed the army and constabulary were looking for new jobs , and other heads were rolling . All pet constabulary rackets were out of bounds , with courts-martial awaiting offenders . Courts-martial also waited for officers careless with government funds . They could not argue with a man who has been in government five years without an accusation of dishonesty and who actually tries to live on his $500 monthly salary , with no additions except what he gets by other legitimate jobs such as the board chairmanship of the Philippine Airlines . Magsaysay 's pretty wife , Luz , his two daughters and a son have learned about doing without on government pay . The officers were expected to learn too . Both services went to work . Army officers were publicly demoted for such odd crimes as not leading their own men in fights against the Huks , or not killing enough bandits when they did fight , or playing politics with the army . Other odd reasons were considered sufficient . By accident , this writer was present when an elderly colonel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village of Tubod , Mindanao . The old man 's face was seamed with thirty years of campaigns , and he desperately wanted everything to be pleasant . But it was n't . Magsaysay said , " Colonel , I hear some of the care boos we bought for the village are dying . Why ? " The old man 's eyes widened , and he made his great mistake . " Dying ' ? " he said . " Oh , yes , some of them . Just old age . " " How old , " said the secretary , " are these carabaos dying of old age ? " The colonel shrugged . " Old ? Five years  --  five years old , these carabaos " At the end , his voice trailed off . Suddenly Magsaysay volleyed his words , " You 're trying to tell me a carsbao only five died of old age ! What do you take me for , colonel ? a fool ? You think I do n't know anything about carabaos , huh , so you can get away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel . They live to be twenty , not five . I 'm relieving you now . In the morning you go back to Manila . You 're relieved . " It was quick and brutal , and possibly not the best decision Magsaysay has made . But the new commander in the village found out what disease ailed the water buffaloes , and got a veterinarian to do something about it . One more mysterious Philippine Government failure was averted . Other officers have been as quickly promoted  --  because they were handy with a rifle , or good at burning down Huk shacks and digging up Huk crops , or using war dogs , or ambushing fleeing bandits . The secretary has promoted many on the spot  --  and often manages to be on the spot himself when a promotion is won . Nobody in the Philippines is far enough away to be safe  --  the secretary works eighteen hours a day , keeps a plane always ready , and may start for the north and end up 500 miles to the south . Eight aides have worn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weariness . A lieutenant colonel in Korea in the winter of 1950 protested to the United Nations command against the supply system , the cold and the general misery of that war . This was a nasty thing for an international command to face when the whole army was cold , short on supplies and miserable . But the command never had to do anything about it . In twenty-four hours Magsaysay had the news through his own channels . In another twenty-four the complaining lieutenant colonel was on his way home , relieved by his own army . Other astonishing things happened to this shaken army . A Moro sultan , Agaus Tawantawan , had raided Mindanao villages for five years , stealing cattle , taking slaves and killing or driving out 20,000 settlers . The army had been powerless , but it was n't when Magsaysay arrived . With the big man in the van , the Mindanao troops gave the sultan two quick beatings and captured his home fort . When they went farther into the mountains , a powerful loud-speaker went along . When he knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . The loud-speaker scared the wits out of the sultan and he surrendered on a promise of amnesty . Today Tawantawan is on Magsaysay 's pay roll as an agent among the Mohammedan Moros . " By golly , " says the secretary , " I pay him forty pesos a month and he thinks he 's governor of Mindanao , but he gives us no more trouble . " The Huks have n't been so easy , but they , too , have had a tough year . Army battalions get loving cups for killing more bandits , and stay in the field month after month . Patrols range the bush , keeping the bandits moving , always pushing , burning and destroying anything the Huks can use . Results are good . Dead Huks have been found with grass in their stomachs , others with homemade shotguns and tin-can grenades . Things were tough at Stalin University . They were tougher when Davie Jones , an American Negro , approached Magsaysay with an idea . Huks distrusted Filipinos and white Americans automatically , but might think a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones , would go into the hills to see what he could find . He saw plenty and reported it when he came back . The second trip was made with a battalion at his heels , straight to the heart of a Huk encampment the soldiers had been hunting for months . Magsaysay got a good bag of Huks , dead and alive . Jones ' reward was enough for a week-long celebration in Manila before be prudently caught a ship to take him beyond the avenging reach of Taruc , Pomeroy and friends . There are still plenty of Huks , and they still make some raids . But the threats of attacking Manila are no more . Seventy per cent of Pampanga land was planted in 1951 , compared to 30 per cent in 1950 . The fear everywhere is fading . The secretary promised he would fight  --  really fight  --  the Huks wherever he could find them . He has . Magsaysay recognized that no campaign against banditry could be permanently successful so long as more people kept becoming bandits . He deduced that no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world revolution . Some others might be natural bandits who would rather steal than work . But the great bulk must be people who had grievances ? mostly peasants who wanted land . In paraphrase , Magsaysay said to prisoners , " Why do you fight ? For land of your own ? Well , then , you can quit fighting , because I 'll give you land . You can have a house in a village with electricity , a school , fifteen acres and a carabao . The government will give it to you . I promise . " Prisoners were at first unbelieving . Many times before , the government had talked about giving away land . But Magsaysay also made a promise to this writer in February , 1951 . He said , " This is true . We 're going to do this . I have two million pesos from the government , and some land . Give me a little while and I 'll take you down to show you . " In September his bluff was called by this writer and photographer Frank Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat collection of thatched huts , complete with school , medical facilities , lights , roads , even its own airfield and the promised water buffaloes  --  not dying of old age now . It 's not perfect , but eighty-seven families are living there ; they appear happy , and no former Huk has run away to fight again . Documents captured in November stated that the communists fear this project and another , larger one now under way . " This , " said a letter from one Huk leader to another , " is the worst thing we have to fight in keeping the movement going . People are beginning to believe . " Strange things have happened all year . The Manila railroad grew worse and worse ? and Quirino handed the job of doing something about it to Magsaysay , although it is well out of the national-defense province . Magsaysay took it in stride . A local investigation revealed shocking conditions . And a stationmaster with a filthy building in Manila looked up one morning to see a flamboyant flowered shirt ? the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense that day . Five minutes later , after a machine-gun tongue lashing for filthiness , laziness and assorted crimes , the stationmaster was looking for a new job . So were a few hundred other useless railroad employees  --  including those who had issued thousands of passes to nearly every politician and army officer in the country . New locomotives came from Japan , and railroad experts from the United States . There still are no luxury trains , but the railroad is operating . Someday it might even be solvent  --  it never has been in all its history . Magsaysay made his attitude clear when he was complimented officially . " Thank you , " he said , " but none of it would have been possible without your support , Mr. President . " Whether his tongue was stuck far out into a cheek is his own business . But the greatest test of Magsaysay came in the autumn of 1951 . An election with nine senatorial seats , forty-six governorships and various local offices at stake was scheduled for November thirteenth . It was of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the 1949 debacle and might indicate directions for the presidential year , 1953 . But to the beleaguered Huks in the hills , it was important . Perhaps because they thought it had to be now or never , Taruc and company made their big play . Filipinos , they said , had nothing to gain from an election . Only stooges and crooks would run . Democracy was dead in the islands . Therefore , there would be no election . They , the Huks , the army of the people , would prevent it . By crudely printed newspaper and thousands of leaflets , they announced a general boycott  --  with death the penalty for voting . The government was helpless . The revolution was on the way . " Workers , arise ! Workers , do n't vote ! " Quirino had gone to San Francisco for the Japanese peace conference . Prudently , he stayed there , then leisurely went around the world , visiting FYanco in Spain and the Pope in Rome . He took a long time . Secretary Magsaysay was the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be elections . Yes , they would be free and fair . There would be no boycott and no danger in voting . He , Magsaysay , would use the whole army , the reserves , the navy and the air force if necessary . He said , " I promise . " On a yacht crossing between Corregidor and Manila on a hot October afternoon , Magsaysay amused himself by // firing a carbine at floating bottles for a while  --  with a curious , deadly expression on his face whenever he fired the weapon . Then he took one of the catnaps which make his terrific working day possible . When he woke , he came forward at a fast walk , sudden animation on his face . " Look , " he said , " what do you think would happen if we used the ROTC cadets from the colleges as poll watchers ? Those kids are eager , but they ca n't even vote . They 'd be honest . Maybe they 're what we need . By golly , I 'll do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trouble started ? but not quite as the Huks had planned . Pamintuan , who had been leading a liquidation squad inside Manila , came to the end of his long road . He took three police officers with him , but died face down in the mud of a slum , riddled by bullets . Feeling the hot breath of Magsaysay on their necks , half a dozen of 4 his important aides surrendered within a week . In Panay , Capadocia , second in command of all the Huks , had no better luck . Spurred on by a 100,000-Peso reward , a civilian patrol wounded him fatally in the mountains . In three different areas of Luzon the army began new operations , driving into Huk Strongholds . Taruc and Pomeroy had all they could do to stay alive . The president did n't bother to come home until voting registration was al-Most over , in October . On election to November thirteenth , he rushed ? o his home province to help his brother Wirt a governorship  --  adding insult to injury by suspending the incumbent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was in 1 , nanila , also in Cebu , Negros and a few other troubled spots . So were all the army ? the marines , navy , reservlata ? and 4500 ROTC cadets , eager paid idealistic . At least two of these last were killed in poll skirmishes , defending that idealism . The Huks tried . A raiding party killed four persons in one village , but lost seven of its own members when tfle army came up . Another group 4-red from high weeds on a polling Place . Here and there were cases of terrorism , even murders , which may or ttuty not have been the work of Huks . Including all pre-election disturbances , between forty and a hundred persons Were killed  --  depending on who did the counting and how he labeled various ambushes and fights . For the Philip -- Pines , it was n't bad . Neither was the vote . People came to the polls in good numbers every-Where , in droves at Manila and other Places where interest was high in local e  --  ntests . The election gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the governorships . or the senate , Jowl Laurel led Nacionaliaras in winning most of the contested But this was of minor importance . The election had been held , the boycott watt a failure . The Huks had lost more Prestige than in any hill fight . And Ramon Magsaysay , who was n't running for a thing , had won the election . Of course , this hardly solved the Philippines ' problems . Land reform is just starting , foreign exchange remains a critical problem , and the morals of many government officials remain unchanged . But one man has spent a year proving that his promise is good . This writer has seen people flocking to his home and office daily , each bringing his problem , no matter how far removed it may be from the sphere of national defense . They 've found a man they can trust . I watched one day when he spent half an hour talking to a terrified youngster from the Luzon backwoods , who had come to him with her starving baby . Her husband , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her . But she had heard that the secretary was fair . I waited , and so did senators , generals and assorted colonels , while the secretary of defense took time to get this baby into a hospital , and food and clothing for the mother . He had promised the people help if they came to him . Magsaysay has made many spot decisions in this year of work , some with a vague clothing of legality , some with no such covering . But somehow , he manages to get things done , leaving the worry about authority until later . Some things he has n't done . There are n't enough able men around him , and that may be his fault . Frequently , only quick advice has saved him from blunders  --  some of the advice American , more or less official . Anger has threatened his judgment , and trifles  --  outlawing the game of mah-jongg from officers ' clubs  --  have wasted his time . Occasionally , party loyalty gets in his way . He says he is still the president 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . Certainly he has n't been able to do much about the industry , honesty and money for the destitute that the country needs so badly . Everything is done on the basis of personal promises , often given when he is n't sure of his authority . What may happen when someday one of those promises collides head-on with the processes of democratic government is anybody 's guess . For more than a year he has insisted that one of these processes , the writ of habeas corpus , must remain suspended in order to save the country . Others before him have found eventually that democratic processes need suspending for the sake of efficiency  --  and the men who started out to save governments ended up by wrecking them . This could happen again in the Philippines . Always , there is the threat that Quirino will somehow get rid of the man who has grown too popular , in spite of the support Magsaysay has here and in the United States . The president never let anyone get this big before . Or the loyalty of Magsaysay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far  --  the terms , " I will , " " I promise , " " I agree " already are on a steady increase in his statements , while references to the president are less and less frequent . Magsaysay may end as president himself , or even as dictator , or no more than a flash in the pan ? no match for the master politicians . But a few things are certain . Nobody stays long around the big man with the multiple loud shirts and the nervous feet without believing in his patriotism , his passionate intent . Not many escape the charm of the booming laugh , a great vitality , a besr hug to indicate spontaneous delight or to celebrate another victory over the enemies of his country .
