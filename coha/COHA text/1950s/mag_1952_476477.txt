THE toughest six months of General Eisenhower 's life began on the night of January 6 , 1952 . As it happened , he himself was asleep when the event took place that was to change his whole way of life and plunge him into a difficult period of outward adjustment and inner torment . At eleven o'clock on the evening of Sunday , January 6 , the silence of the almost empty press room at SHAPE , the General 's headquarters in the Marly Forest in France , was broken by the shrill ring of a telephone . Only one man was there to answer , Lieutenant Colonel Harry Connally , an Air Force public-relations officer , who was assigned as late duty officer that night . The " Little Pentagon " of Europe was ablaze with light but the long low corridors were empty . The voice on the telephone came from Paris , twelve miles away ? the dry voice of a news agency editor : " Hello , Harry ? Just got a bulletin from Washington . Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? what 's your comment on Ike becoming a candidate ? " Colonel Connally hit into his cigar firmly and growled in reply : " So what ? " This short brush-off caused considerable merriment afterward , and the official spokesman became jocularly known throughout Paris as " So-what Connally . " But at the moment he was accurately reflecting the attitude of most people at SHAPE and indeed of the Supreme Commander himself . General Eisenhower was a military man and any political agitation on his behalf was none of his business . Even the next day General Eisenhower did not deign to sec reporters to comment on the start of his Presidential campaign . It was not until late in the afternoon of Monday , January 7 , that we got any kind of reaction from him , and then it was a statement read for him by his chief P.R.O. , Brigadier General Charles Lanham . Ike had left his office about an hour and a half early , ducking the crowd of clamoring newsmen . It seems difficult to believe now , in retrospect , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican , " there was a rush to put the news on the wires ; that this was the first time the General had ever publicly revealed his political affiliation ; and that up to this moment there had actually been speculation about the Democrats offering him the nomination on their ticket . the General went to Lisbon , his presence there would dramatize his advocacy of collective security and his position as the executor of Democratic Administration policies . After considerable soul-searching ? during which he wrote for advice to his former assistant , Omar Bradley , who had become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ? the General decided not to go to Lisbon . Instead , he sent his chief of staff , General Alfred M. Gruenther . Later he sent Gruenther to Washington to testify on the Administration 's foreign-aid programs . For he realized that in Washington , as in Lisbon , anything he did would inevitably take on a political coloration . During the next few weeks Ike was manifestly going through the inner torment of a man who could not come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both to do his military duty and to " be available " for political candidacy , he was coming as close as he had ever come to violating his own basic principles of honesty and straightforwardness . He had thrown a khaki curtain about himself at SHAPE , but there were glaring holes in it ; for he was writing letters , and it seemed as if every letter that he wrote to the States immediately burst into print there . The newsmen at SHAPE protested hotly at the publication of political letters , like one giving his views on the tidelands-oil question , at a time when they were still being told that the General would not talk politics when in uniform . As the protests and pressures mounted , Ike became even more inaccessible . His smile was gone , lines formed on his forehead , and you could see the nervousness and fatigue in his face . His harried condition became so obvious that his personal physician put out a special communiqu ? about the General 's health , insisting that he was in perfect form , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual communiqu ? about a Supreme Commander . Pretty soon a new phenomenon appeared at this schizophrenic military-political headquarters . A mysterious , gray-haired , professorial-looking civilian was to be seen walking the corridors of SHAPE and ducking in and out of the Supreme Commander 's office . This was Kevin McCann , President of Defiance College in Ohio , an old-time friend of Ike 's and a wartime staff assistant of his . Newsmen soon discovered that he had no military assign-ment ; instead , he was writing a biography of Eisenhower ? to be published on May 19 as The Man from Abilene ? a highly political panegyric . McCann had an office in SHAPE and saw the General frequently . He also produced a series of articles printed by the New York Herald Tribune to show where the General stood on the major issues of the day ; it included one long letter written to an " anonymous friend " with a mine of information on Ike 's views . The " anonymous friend " was never officially revealed ; but correspondents at SHAPE soon became convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write the letter to clarify his political ideas . Surely for a man who believed in keeping military affairs and politics separate , and who refused to talk with reporters about political matters , such close co-operation with the author of an approved biography and a series of political articles meant skating along the thin edge of honesty . And no one knew this better than the General himself . No wonder he had become irritable , short-tempered , and worried . Unwittingly he had maneuvered himself into an untenable situation , in which he was inevitably miserable . III T HEN came a new turning point on the General 's political road . Late in March the wires brought the news that over a hundred thousand Minnesotans had taken the trouble to write in the name Eisenhower on that state 's primary ballot . It was the biggest write-in in American political history . Hundreds did not even know how to spell his name , but wrote in " Eisenhauer " or " Isenhour " or just plain " Ike . " The General was deeply moved . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . It meant that there was a real groundswell for him . He knew now that lie had made a mistake on January 7 and that he would have to do something about his candidacy ; he could no longer remain wholly non-political . Yet he still clung stubbornly to the belief that he would not have to become an active campaigner . And he was bewildered as to what to do . He called in Buck Lanham and told him the time had come to see some of the newsmen . Not only must be comment on the extraordinary Minnesota phenomenon , but he felt that he needed help and advice from those reporters whom he had in the past regarded as his friends . He had to " talk it over with the boys . " So Lanham. called up a dozen correspondents representing the major American agencies , networks , and daily papers , and invited them to an off-the-record luncheon . ( The off-the-record restriction was the usual one enforced for military security , but we knew we would be able to make general use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that luncheon has never been lifted and I am still not at liberty to quote what took place there , though by now most of what Ike told us has become public . But at least I can say that he told us that Minnesota had caught him by surprise , that he knew now that he could not keep politics and the Army separate , and that he would have to take off his uniform and go home . He wanted our advice on what sort of statement we expected him to make . An hour after he left us , Lanham put out a statement in which the General said that he had been " touched " by the spontaneous movement for him in Minnesota , and that the result there had forced him to reconsider his statement of January 7 . But beyond that he would not go . Naturally this set off a chain-reaction of speculation as to what his reconsideration would lead to . What he was actually doing was writing to the President and the Secretary of Defense asking to be relieved of his assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this until many days later . Not until April II was the news released from the White House . And meanwhile there was going to take place , on April 2 , the celebration of the first anniversary of the activation of his SHAPE headquarters , with a major address by the Supreme Commander to be beamed by radio to all the fourteen member nations and to the United States , and by sound-film recording for nation-wide television release in the United States . However , the General was still in no posidon to announce his decision to give up his European job ; he insisted , as always , that this celebration was to be a military event ; but the fact that he knew he would he listened to as a political candidate rather than as the Supreme Commander made him moreuneasy than I- had ever seen him before . It was my unpleasant duty , as chairman of the SHAPE . Correspondents ' Association for radio and television , to deal with Lanham and Ike on the arrangements for recording this speech on tape and on film . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole idea , that he hated cameras above all , that he would do the thing in his own way and we would have to take what he gave us . At first he wanted to do his radio , television , and newsreel recording in the privacy of his own office , with his own military assistants in charge and with no newsmen present . And even though a howl of protest led to my being admitted to observe and recommend proper procedures , the occasion was a strange one . We were brought into the conference room hours in advance , set up our equipment . and waited . At last the General strode in flanked by a dozen or so officers . His reading of his speech was a poor performance technically ; he , read it from a notebook on his desk , so that he was constantly bending down with his bald head to the camera and the lights glinting on it ( he wore no TV makeup ) . When I intervened twice to ask him . to keep his head up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speech , he scowled and his eyes blazed with anger . General Lanham pulled me away , saying , " Listen , Dave , cameras make Ike nervous . He 's so jumpy now that he might explode at any minute and then we 'll get nothing from him . Take what you can and be satisfied . " This was not the familiar Eisenhower . And it occurred to me that what made him most uncomfortable was the fact that our sugges ? dons were designed to help him by presenting him at his best . He was in a mood of self-flagellation , as though he were punishing himself for having even as little to do with politics as he did ; he seemed stubbornly determined to put his worst face forward . The Great Compromiser , who had built his career on his charm , amiability , and knack for getting people to pull together as a team , found himself in a situation like that of a general having to meet a two-front attack ; he was angrily doing everything wrong , almost willfully wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got himself into . This was a stranger we were dealing with , not good old Ike . His friends and managers hoped that , once he got home to the States , he would become again the charming , pleasant Ike of the broad grin , the firm boy from the plains of Kansas who never lost his head no matter how many honors were heaped upon him , who met prime ministers and kings without losing the common touch ? the simplicity , freshness , and homespun Americanism of the Middle West . But this did not happen all at once . For he had new difficulties to face . When he landed at the airport in Washington on June 1 , his eyes were still strained and swollen and his grin forced ; and despite a promise to stop a minute in front of the newsmen 's stand on the field , he strode past us and our microphones and cameras with a stiff-legged military step and never paused a second . His mood was better when he made a surprise visit to Republican headquarters in Washington just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reception line in a crowded office and shook hands with a hundred or so political workers and stenographers and clerks ; I was standing right behind them , and was amazed to see that they actually seemed to be enjoying themselves . Later Mamie said to me , " You know we really do like people . and that part of politics is a real pleasure to us . " But a few minutes later , at the Washington airport , he got an annoying reminder of what it was like to be a civilian in politics . The ubiquitous little girl who always turns up with a bouquet of flowers was there to say good-by to Ike for the photographers ' benefit . As he accepted the flowers a photographer shouted , " Go on and kiss her , Ike , kiss herl " Ike hesitated a moment . started to bend down , then straightened up again , pleading with the cameramen , " Wait a minute , fellows ? it takes a man time to get used to this baby-kissing routine . " He was deeply troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On his special train from Kansas City to Abilene he had an after-breakfast chat with us reporters , and admitted that he had waked up very early that morning . tight and nervous . He reminded us that on another June 4. eight years earlier , he had faced the decision whether to give thesignal which would send a million Allied soldiers , sailors , and airmen against Hitler 's Atlantic Wall ? and had decided , on account of the stormy weather , to wait a day . He said that the next day , after the order had been given , there had been nothing left to do but pray ; and he added , rubbing his chin , " I did a little praying this morning , gentlemen . I do n't mind admitting that I am. much more nervous than on D-Day . This is a strange new world for me . " It was a world in which he did not know the rules and was fighting on unfamiliar terrain . And now he was facing a new perplexity . In the Army he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a card-index of first-rate officers . Every time he met an officer who impressed him , he had recorded the man 's name and talents on a card ready to be pulled out when needed . He could rely fully upon a man like Walter Bedell Smith or Alfred Gruenther because he knew all about their capabilities . But he had no card-file of politicians . He did not know who the real experts were , did not understand their arguments . He had no chief of staff on whom he could place unquestioning reliance . Henry Cabot Lodge was the nearest thing to one . But there was also Dewey , the man in the shadows , the " king-maker " of the Eisenhower movement . There were Dewey men such as the astute Herbert Brownell , Jr . and Thomas Stephens ; there were Lodge aides such as Paul Hoffman and Robert Matthews ; there was what might be called the Kansas Cornbelt Group , including his brother Milton , and the veteran Kansas politician Senator Frank Carlson , and Senator Fred A. Seaton of Nebraska , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Arthur Vandenberg , Jr. , whom he made his chief adniinistrative assistant . But it was a loose organization , did not operate as a team . There were differences of opinion in it , as between the Dewey group , who wanted him to concentrate upon meeting and winning delegates . and the Lodge-Hoffman group . who wanted him to get about the country and build up public enthusiasm behind the delegates . He was uncertain whose advice to follow , whom to count upon completely . He was like a man playing by ear upon an unfamiliar instrument . When he reached Abilene ? a town swollen to ten times its normal size for his homecoming ? he was obviously ill at case , thrown off his balance by the carnival atmosphere of the town and by the abominable weather . Some weeks later I was chatting with him at the Cherry Hills Country Club in Denver when someone in the party said he pitied Ike for the terrible strain he was under in learning to be a candidate , and Ike replied : " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sin of egotism . Still , a feller ca n't help saying , why the devil did it have to rain that day in Abilene ? " The Abilene speech almost ended his campaign before it had begun . The raging rainstorm turned back most of the crowd and made Ike look like a tired old man when he faced the cameras , wrapped in an oilskin slicker with his few sparse hairs streaming down his face , as with his steel-rimmed glasses he tried to read his rain-soaked text . His performance seemed wooden . The famous Eisenhower charm did n't come through . But I caught a glimpse of the real Eisenhower a moment before he made the speech . His managers had called rue aside and said they would bring Ike under the stand where our cables and cameras were , so that his speech could still be carried across the country even though the rain kept him from making it outdoors in the stadium . Ike came in , took one look at the maze of wires and the bleak , cold eyes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here , this is no good at all . Besides , there are still a lot of people out there waiting for me . If they can get wet so can I. " That quick reaction was typical of him ? of his basic dislike for the impersonal machines of modern communications , and his deep feeling of responsibility to people , his liking for them , and his willingness to share with them . 0 N EISENHOWER 'S return from Abilene , the Dewey group took him over the hurdles in New York . Installed in his Columbia University house on Morningside Drive , he spent a whole week meeting hundreds of delegates from all over the country , learning what questions interested them most , how to talk with them , and what public life in these United States was really like . He described that New York experience about ten days later in Detroit . He said : " I-lave you ever had what . the press calls a ' death watch ' put on your door ? You ca n't go anywhere without a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen in on your conversations . You have no privacy except in the intimacy of your bedroom ? and then , you 'd better look under the bed first . " Ike paused a moment , grinned , and added , " I had to learn the hard way , but I do believe it 's right . If a man is presenting himself to the people to be the highest magistrate in the land , then he has no right any more to privacy . You have a right to know all about him . That 's part of our democracy . " But for him it was a hard way indeed . One day he came near exploding . lie was having his picture taken with the Vermont delegation on the steps of his Columbia house , holding a can of maple syrup that the delegates had given him as a souvenir of Vermont . A photographer shouted , " Hey , Ike , get Mamie out ? she ought to hold the maple syrup , not you . " Ike winced at the familiar use of his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being ordered what to do . Five-star generals do n't get treated that way . But he took a grip on himself , turned round , and asked the butler to ask Mrs. Eisenhower to come out . Mamie came out , took her place , and dutifully held the maple syrup ? whereupon the same photographer reached over to the man next to her , pulled an I LIKE IKE button off his lapel , and then grabbed the blouse of Mamie 's dress and stuck the button on her . Ike turned crimson with rage and started toward the photographer with arm stiffened and fist clenched . Then somehow , in mid-air , he caught himself . And all he did was to growl in a low voice , " Do n't ever do that again , son . " In those days of his introduction to politics he was always worried about Mamie ? about her health , about how she would react to the rough and tumble of politics and of its smear campaigns . He need not have worried ; she was one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and natural , who demonstrated that she likes and is instinctively liked by people . When I asked her one day how she managed to take it so well , she said , " It was a lot rougher not to be able to follow him during the war , wondering where he was , wanting to be with him . And you know , in peace time we Army women are used to following our men halfway round the world to all kinds of posts . It 's nice to be home again , even on the road . " IT WAS on the night of June 13 , when the General was on his way by train from Gettysburg to Detroit , where he was to make a major speech the next evening , that Eisenhower 's managers found that he had definitely dropped his " draft-me " attitude and was going to wage a fighting campaign . Ike was tired and disgruntled . He had spent the day meeting the important Pennsylvania delegation on his Gettysburg farm , going through the act of climbing fences for photographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beautiful old farm get cluttered with flash bulbs . His right hand had been twisted by an enthusiastic admirer at the station , and was inflamed and aching from a thousand handshakes . His chief administrative assistant , Arthur Vandenberg , Jr. , wanted the Detroit speech to be a humdinger , and kept scuttling through the train seeing how the ghost-writers , Kevin McCann and Stanley High , were doing . Finally he went into Ike 's compartment carrying three final versions for him to choose from . Ike read them with mounting impatience and anger , threw them down , and snapped , " These do n't sound like me at all , and besides I tell you frankly I do n't have the slightest idea what they mean . It 's all a lot of double talk and I 'm Fed up with it . " Vandenberg asked him what he intended to do , with the speech only a few hours away . " I 'm going to sleep , - said Ike , " and there is n't going to be any text . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my heart . It 's about time I spoke for myself . I 'll know what to say . " Ike 's decision , announced to the public the next morning , caught the nation 's attention . It was dramatic , unorthodox ; it seemed like a breath of fresh air in politics . And his speech that night was excellent , lived up to its dramatic billing . He lashed out at the Democrats , " a party too long in power , " said he was n't afraid to be a crusader for peace and honesty no matter what the MAGAZINE sophisticates thought , and came up with a brilliant slogan : " / am strictly a no-deal candidate . " His managers were delighted . But when it was all over the realization struck home that Ike had not said the kind words about labor that he had been expected to say in Detroit . There had been no labor men among his advisers , and for this reason his managers had been all the more eager for him to pay tribute in Detroit to labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And why had n't he done it ? When I asked him later , he answered , " Well , I was going to . but as I got round to it the prompter signaled me that I had one minute of air time Left so I could n't start that late . " This was the result of his decision to abandon text and speak " from the heart . " It was the act of the amateur , full of fire , fervor , and forgetfulness . LL LL three ? fire , fervor , and forgetfulness ? characterized his journey from De- troit on to Denver and then Dallas , and the last whirlwind whistle-stop tour through Nebraska and Iowa that carried him on to Chicago and the nomination . His foreign-policy speech at Denver was the intellectual highlight of his entire tour , with no concessions of any kind to the stereotypes of Old Guard Republicanism . Three nights later , at the Denver Coliseum , he yielded to the pleas of his managers ? or of some of them ? and after a dramatic entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor slowly with the spotlights focused on him , made a speech that might have been characterized as his initiation address into the Republican party ? a cliche-ridden collection of tributes to Lincoln , God , and the Republican past , combined with suggestions that the Democrats were responsible for the war in Korea , the " tragedy " of Yalta , and all the sins of our times . In the course of this tour the ignorance he displayed in his off-the-cuff remarks sometimes astonished reporters , as when he told a group of farm editors that he had no farm policy ? wanted them to tell him ? would be glad to learn ; and when he asked a group of soil and conservation experts what were parity prices , and what was a sliding scale ? But such disclosures of ignorance did not seem to shock the delegates themselves ; many of them enlightened him at length . and you could almost see them getting ready to go home and tell their friends what they had told Ike when he asked them what to do . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to the Nebraska delegation at Chicago about the importance of religion to a nation , he attributed the weakness of France to the large proportion of atheists and agnostics in France ? a remark that he did not seem to realize would at once be cabled abroad , with damaging results . But the last-moment decision to make the whistle-stop run to Chicago produced brilliantly successful results . His managers ' idea was , first , to whip up such popular enthusiasm for Ike in the delegates ' home towns that these men could not afford to ignore it and . second , to take every major fight in the Convention itself ? Texas , Louisiana . and Georgia especially ? to the floor , where Ike 's forces could muster majorities for fair play in the full view of television , to overthrow the decisions of the Taft-controlled committees . This successful plan was not without its ironies . In the first place , there was Eisenhower 's own acute distaste for radio and television . As I have already indicated . he rebelled against the mechanical nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camera makes him feel like an actor , insincere and uncomfortable . He was slow to realize that he has the plastic face and the genuine warmth of personality which should make him a television natural if he could get over his uneasiness in the presence of the machinery . In addition , he was and is far from convinced that television is good for our public life . He wonders whether television viewers will judge a man 's worth by the way he looks rather than by more solid virtues . And lie asks what use of the medium might be made by a demagogue like Huey Long who happened to be a great public speaker and actor . And there was a further irony in the fact that his own managers , at Abilene , had tried at first to bar radio and television from his news conference there ? only to end the tour to the Convention uttering cries of " steal " and " iron curtain " when the National Committee kept its doors closed at Chicago . Nevertheless it was an excellent idea for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican decision-making to the fullest scrutiny of radio and television audiences . But they had n't counted on their candidate 's forgetfulness . We were on the train en route to McCook , Nebraska , where Eisenhower was to make his charge of " steal , " when his chief public-relations officer on the train , Robert Mullen , gave us correspondents some advance notes of the speech ? a statement by Ike that an " iron-curtain mentality " was now evident in our country too , in Chicago , where a small group of bosses were trying to keep the truth from the people , and so on . Well , when we got to McCook , we dashed off the train to file our stories while Ike was delivering his rear-platform address ? only to learn , when we boarded the train again , that he had forgotten to mention the radio-television ban . He had charged that an iron-curtain mentality was operating . in our country , but had n't explained how , which must have somewhat mystified his McCOok audiences . Mr. Mullen promised us that Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went out on the platform at Hastings all primed to do so , but once again forgot . As he came back to the lounge car I stopped him and asked him why he had this peculiar block about mentioning the radio and television ban . He laughed and said , " Oh , Dave , I always forget to mention it . Look , why do n't you give me a piece of candy as a present for mentioning it ? Then next time I 'll hold the candy in my hand and remember why you gave it to me . " I sent him a bar of chocolate ? but he never did get round to making the statement that already was becoming front-page news all over the country . EvEarnEeEss the whistle-stop tour was a thumping success . Always at his best with small audiences with whom he may speak informally and affably , Ike came into Chicago on a wave of popular acclaim ; and when his managers won their big test vote on " fair-play " on opening day , those of us who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roll . Eisenhower had survived triumphantly his tormenting ordeal , making the difficult transition from military man to civilian , from aloof . ness to political aggressiveness , from ignoramus in political affairs to successful nominee ; he had come through his first harrowing experiences with the fierce light that beats upon the Presidential candidate ; and he had adjusted himself to the mechanics of campaigning ? even going along with the belief of his managers that he should use television to the utmost . He was aided in this transition by his pliability . He is a man who bends readily with the wind ; in fact a strong breeze can tilt him . He is the kind of fighter who is willing to change his tactics as much as may be needed so long as his long-range strategy is kept intact . He will make almost any concession on methods and procedures so long as the goal is left unchanged , so long as his basic concept of honor , integrity , and broad objective is inviolate . For instance , he abhors McCarthyisin but will not attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing ? is not to campaign for him , although he has said that he will support every Republican candidate for office . But the test Ike faces is not over . For he has not yet really found himself . So far , he has been play-acting the part of candidate . It still comes hard . And he will never achieve such peace of mind and steadfastness of purpose as he knew in the Army until he finds the way to be real and a candidate at the same time . This is hard enough to do even for a professional politician who has long ago made his peace with the exigencies of his practice . It is overwhelmingly difficult for a man like Eisenhower , who with his fame achieved and his place in history secure , is now risking a lifetime of achievement and honor in a new adventure in a strange new world .
