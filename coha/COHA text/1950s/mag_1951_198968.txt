In Manhattan , the critics , the columnists and the cash customers were all bubbling with delight over a return to the good old days . Two-a-day vaudeville was back at the old Palace Theater , and there was resounding applause for Judy Garland , who had brought it there . For 75 minutes on opening night Judy burned up the boards with " electric excitement , " paused occasionally to wipe her brow with a bright scarf ( " It is n't very ladylike , but it 's very necessary " ) , and sang such old favorites as Somewhere , over the Rainbow and The Trolley Song . One critic predicted the show would stay a year . Wrote Critic Ward Morehouse : " I doubt if there 'll be another night like it during the entire theatrical season . " <P> <P> Body &; Soul <P> Speaking at a Protestant Episcopal laymen 's Sunday service in Manhattan , Pulitzer Prize Poet W. H. Auden told the congregation : " It is important for us to be completely honest with ourselves about our religious experience-what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the Middle Ages was of God 's nearness . Now our dominant experience is of God 's absence , of His distance . We are false if we do not admit this . The danger is of despair and unbelief . But for our time , the distance of God may be something He wishes us to learn . " <P> The Right Rev. Horace W. B. Donegan , Protestant Episcopal bishop of New York , dedicated a new sports window in Manhattan 's Cathedral of St. John the Divine . The window was planned by the late Bishop William T. Manning , who believed good sportsmanship and religion had much in common . To illustrate his point , the stained-glass window shows the symbolic figures of athletes surrounding medallions of Esau the hunter , Jacob wrestling with the Angel , and St. Paul with his advice to run a good race . On the wall will be added the names of some modern sports giants : Tennis Champion Robert D. Wrenn , baseball 's Christy Mathewson , football 's Walter Camp and hockey 's Hobey Baker . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy after winning the National Intercollegiate and Clay Court tennis championships last summer , got news that he could postpone his naval career for awhile . After he had spent four weeks in Bainbridge , Md. boot camp , sports-conscious brass approved a go-day leave for him to represent the U.S. in the Davis Cup matches in Australia in December . <P> Elsewhere photographers snapped some candid shots of part-time sports figures in lesser events : in Biarritz on a recent vacation , two-year-old Arabella , daughter of Randolph and granddaughter of Winston Churchill , huffed &; puffed till her tongue hung out playing solitaire with a beach ball . In Falkenstein , Germany , U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy practiced place-kicks before a game of touch football between his office staff and a team of American newspaper correspondents . The practice paid off : McCloy ' s eleven trounced the writers 10-0 . <P> <P> Friends &; Countrymen <P> Off on a hospital tour to cheer bedridden G.I.s , Cinemactress Rita Hayworth arrived at the Army 's Madigan General Hospital , near Tacoma , where one orthopedic patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover his naked feet before the noted visitor arrived . At the Bremerton Naval Hospital , a sailor achieved fame of sorts in his ward when he saw Rita and asked : " Who 's that babe ? "
