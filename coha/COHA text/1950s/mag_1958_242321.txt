Last week , 40 years after his first swing on a back-lot liana , Tarzan of the Apes ooo-eee-ooed the famed yodel , dropped from the treetops into his 32nd movie . Since the other 31 were all financial successes-a combined total gross of more than $500 million and a total audience of 2 billion people-the new Tarzan 's Fight for Life showed the sort of promise most appreciated by Cinemogul Sy Weintraub , new head of Sol Lesser Productions , owner of the ape man . <P> The film also shows a Tarzan who has evolved in a wide arc from the original character of Edgar Rice Burroughs ' novels , first played on the screen by the late Elmo Lincoln in 1918 . Compared to Elmo , who was built like a water tower and once - on the set-killed a lion that tried to rough him up , the Tarzans of mid-century are sissies . Tarzan 's dialogue , over the years , has improved from a simple grunt to almost literate palaver . <P> The first Tarzan who actually spoke whole sentences was Lex Barker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1948 replaced Johnny Weissmuller , the mobil-est Tarzan of them all . An Olympic champion and once the fastest swimmer in the world , Weissmuller also holds the record for longevity as the jungle hero : twelve versions over 16 years . Today 's Tarzan is Gordon Scott , 30 , with a 50-in. chest . A onetime lifeguard at a Las Vegas hotel , Scott is the first Tarzan in color and CinemaScope . <P> In Tarzan 's Fight for Life , Scott carries on with Jane No. 19 ( Eve Brent ) , demonstrates what has become of Novelist Burroughs ' inarticulate hero , the offspring of titled British parents whose deaths left him as a child to the motherhood of the jungle . The pristine Tarzan of the screen who hated all white men-although his name , in Burroughswahili , meant white ( tar ) man ( zan ) - is now the champion of modern medical science . Tarzan 1958 knows a simple defense against the slings and arrows of mumbo jumbo . His prescription : " Take pill quick . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
