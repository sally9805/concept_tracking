Matched against the 158-man U.S. contingent , the four Russian newsmen seemed lost in the 1,174-man army of correspondents and technicians from 56 nations that swarmed through Geneva last week . But the Russians cared not a bit . Long on record as thinking the Big Four foreign ministers ' conference a time-wasting prelude to the summit , the Russian government was out to shape the news , not report it . And Soviet press pitchmanship was an outstanding feature of the first conference week . <P> Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko set the style , soon became a topic of conversation among newsmen surpassing both the friskings by Swiss police and the frisky Swiss barmaids at press headquarters in Geneva 's " Batiment Electoral . " Landing in Geneva , Gromyko made a pithy statement specifically prepared to make pithy headlines . After that , in his dealings with the press , Gromyko set out to prove himself an amiable man of peace , erase the image of the sullen spokesman who so often barked nyet at the U.N . Security Council . While the Western foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed for photographers , even agreed to chat with the New York Times 's James ( " Scotty " ) Reston and A. M. Rosenthal when they showed up unannounced at his villa . <P> Soviet Earful . Beyond Gromyko 's personal performance , the Russians showed they have finally mastered the main news-shaping device of mid-century diplomacy : the formal briefing . With the foreign ministers meeting behind closed doors , many correspondents found the post-session briefings their only source of solid news , other than the handouts of speeches for which they scrambled wildly . <P> The Soviets always staged a good show . They grabbed off a large , airy upstairs conference room , while Britain and the U.S. were lodged in the basement . They were the only Big Four delegation to brief newsmen in two languages ( Russian and English ) . While Western spokesmen - the U.S. 's earnest Assistant Secretary of State Andrew Berding , Britain 's smooth Peter Hope and France 's witty Pierre Baraduc-were stuck with reporting the actual facts of the conference , Russia 's lively Mikhail A. Kharlamov labored under no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Displaying a showman 's neat touch , Kharlamov once produced Deputy Foreign Minister Valerian A. Zorin to field questions , later used the old politician 's trick of calling a surprise session at noon in order to hit the afternoon papers with a fresh story ( the claim that Russia would insist to the end on full participation for Communist Poland and Czechoslovakia ) . With such attractions , Russian briefings regularly attracted bigger audiences than those of the West . <P> Six-Sided Story . To the newsman attempting to follow the briefings over the earphone sets provided by the Swiss in the press building , the foreign ministers ' conference often seemed bewilderingly contradictory . On a typical night , after the foreign ministers had agreed to seat the East and West German delegations at separate tables ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , a correspondent switching from briefing to briefing would have heard : <P> THE U.S. : The East and West Germans had been admitted only as advisers , could speak only if the Big Four agreed . <P>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
