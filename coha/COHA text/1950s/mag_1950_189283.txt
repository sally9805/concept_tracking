Come Back , Little Sheba ( by William Inge ; produced by the Theatre Guild ) tells of a couple , married for 20 years , who should never have married at all . Doc had gotten Lola into trouble ; afterwards the baby died , and the sexy , good-natured , empty-headed girl turned into a shiftless housewife , her mind on men , her thoughts in the past . Doc wound up not a doctor , but a chiropractor , and ( until Alcoholics Anonymous took over ) a drunk . His career blighted , his emotions blunted , he half sleepwalks through life . Then , discovering that their college-girl boarder is turning , like Lola , into a slut , he goes on another drunken rampage . <P> The play tries hard to be honest , manages in places to be effective , has a fierce moment or two , as when at the end Doc clings for help , like a drowning man , to the wife who has made him drown . And as Lola and Doc , Shirley Booth and Sidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal that is human , perceptive , vivid to their roles . <P> But Come Back , Little Sheba is not a very good , or even a very interesting , play . It makes plain enough what it wants to do , but never actually does it , never communicates the awful internal bleeding of mismated lives , the blundering wastefulness of life itself . Possibly Lola is too shallow to allow of much probing . But the more complicated , frustrated Doc does need-to be probed . For one thing , is he the tragic victim of a single mistake , or a weak man almost bound to fail ? Playwright Inge tends to substitute mere sympathy for insight , and to employ those little touches that , though meant to be telling , are just the worn small change of domestic drama . Too often , with a dull pen , he writes on tracing paper .
