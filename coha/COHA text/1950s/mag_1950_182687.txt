To 20th Century taxpayers , one of the world 's least esthetic individuals is the faceless Moloch known to them only by his title , the Collector of Internal Revenue . But officials in the art-loving , 13th Century Italian republic of Siena were tax collectors of a different sort . When the camarlingo ( chamberlain ) completed his six months ' term , he had his parchment records bound between two wooden panels , and commissioned some of the republic 's most eminent artists to decorate the covers with tempera paintings . In Florence 's Strozzina Gallery last week , some examples of such fancied-up account books were on public display for the first time . <P> More than a hundred of these tavolette had been recovered from Siena 's archives . Many of them were portraits of the camarlinghi themselves seated stiffly at broad desks with their secretaries . But later samples included fragments of the brilliantly colored , elaborately detailed painting of Siena 's prime : virgins with patterned golden haloes , battle scenes , street scenes . Among the anonymous panels on exhibit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sienese artists as Taddeo di Bartolo , Stefano di Giovanni Sassetta and Ambrozio Lorenzetti . <P> By last week the show had made such a hit with Italian critics and gallerygoers that museums in five other European countries had already asked to have a look at it when the panels go on tour next month .
