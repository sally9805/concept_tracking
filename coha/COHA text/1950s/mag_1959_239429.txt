On the eve of battle , the West was ready . And after all the months of doubts and suspicions , it took the four Western Foreign Ministers only two days in Paris to agree on their strategy . The ground had been well prepared . <P> Going into next week 's session with Russia 's Andrei Gromyko , the West will operate from a 20-page " Phased Plan , " the result of considering hundreds of position papers . In some respects it goes farther than what the West put forward at the fruitless Geneva summit session in 1955 . Though still insisting that German reunification must be brought about through free elections , it no longer insists on elections first . And it makes ingenious use of the Russian notion that reunification is something for the two Germanies to solve themselves . Main points : <P> 1 ) A " German Electoral Committee " would be nominated by the West and East German governments in a proportion , based on population , of 25 West Germans to ten East Germans . The committee would arrange increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers-culminating in adoption of a common currency . After a period of " at least three years , " during which progress could be measured and trust justified , the committee would prepare legislation for free , all-German elections . <P> 2 ) Gradual European disarmament would start , synchronized with and dependent upon political progress . The U.S. and U.S.S.R. would limit their forces to 2,500,000 men apiece . <P> 3 ) A four-power " Control Commission , " besides supervising this program , would establish , before the program is complete , a mechanism for inspecting armaments in a broad zone extending on both sides of the Iron Curtain . <P> 4 ) Once Germany is reunited and peace treaties are signed , Berlin becomes the German capital , and the need for keeping allied troops in West Berlin is ended . Western powers would then offer the East treaties safeguarding against any new menace of German imperialism . <P> Stance &; Circumstances . The new man in these deliberations , U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , won admiration from his colleagues in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself well over toward the British position in favor of serious negotiations with the Russians . But he also made a significant concession to the French . He had wanted to make public the Western proposal May 10 , the day before the meeting with the Russians began . But the French argued that since the Russians started all the fuss by threatening Berlin , they should be required to submit a plan first . Herter agreed . <P> What if the Russians reject the West 's package ? The British , believing that something will still have to be done about Berlin , suggested that the U.N . might be called in . In a speech to Copenhagen students last week , Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold carefully warned that " practical considerations alone " would prevent the U.N . from taking upon itself " administrative tasks which require political decisions . " The U.S. is willing to add some sort of U.N . presence in Berlin , but nothing that weakens the West 's right to have its own troops there .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
