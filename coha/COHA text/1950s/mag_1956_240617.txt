A schoolteacher who is tireless , vigilant and indifferent to big red apples was on exhibit at London 's Physical Society . The teacher is electronic and the creation of two young Cambridge scientists , Physicist McKinnon ) Wood and Psychologist Gordon Pask , under contract with Solartron Electronic Group Ltd . Designed for teaching such routine skills as typing and running radar equipment , the electronic teacher gives patient , individual attention . <P> The trouble with human teachers , say Wood and Pask , is that unless they are extremely good , they can not observe in detail the intimate characteristics of each pupil . Each pupil 's biases , habits and individual eccentricities determine how he should be taught . He may favor his left hand over his right hand , or be able to remember odd numbers better than even ones . An ideal teacher should take all such matters into account and teach accordingly . <P> Solartron 's electronic teacher is set up to teach how to duplicate patterns of light in a frame containing eight lights . It starts the lessons by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears , telling the pupil which button to press . After a few such easy examples , the lessons get harder . Light patterns can be duplicated only by complicated operations with the buttons . The teacher gives clues , tells the pupil whether he is doing well or badly and makes him repeat over and over if he is making errors . Always understanding , the machine holds back a difficult exercise until the pupil is ready . If set up to teach typing , it can tell the pupil which finger to use and in which direction to move it . If the pupil is a hardened hunt-and-peck typist , the teacher will discover his sloppy habits and set about correcting them at once . <P> Wood and Pask got so interested in the teaching problem that they created an electronic pupil named Eucrates I , * to give the electronic teacher a real workout . Eucrates is electronic but not bright . When not being taught , he is " thinking " in a confused way , and the electronic teacher must take account of his thinking habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often wrong . If the teacher is too severe or goes too fast , Eucrates shows signs of electronic emotion , equivalent to bursting into tears . Then the electronic teacher is gentle with him until his little dials have stopped quivering . <P> <P> *Eucrates , an archon of Athens , was famed for neglect and excuses .
