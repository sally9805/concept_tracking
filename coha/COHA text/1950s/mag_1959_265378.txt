Though the distinguished visitor would not officially achieve the rank of head of state until his country withdraws its allegiance next fall to the British Crown ( though not the Commonwealth ) , his hosts in nearby Conakry , the capital of Guinea , decided to give him a 21-gun salute anyway . In a few minutes , a cane-swinging Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana strode down the gangplank of his chartered freighter to embrace , somewhat stiffly , the President of the Republic of Guinea , youthful ( 37 ) Skou Tour . Later , when the two men stood side by side to review the tiny , 2,000-man Guinean army , a banner waved over their heads saying : " Vive I'Union Guine-Ghana ! " But last week , as Nkrumah started his long , 21-day conference with Tour , the big question was : How much life is there in their union ? <P> When the two men , " inspired by the example of the 13 American colonies , " joined forces last November , scarcely a month had passed since Guinea cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed an auspicious first step toward an eventual United States of Africa , and he promised a $28 million loan . Of this sum , $11 million has been paid-half of it just before Nkrumah 's arrival . Otherwise , the union has been largely talk . Tour , the junior partner , has been moving off in some alarming directions of his own . <P> Target No. 1 . Out of concern for ruffled French feelings , the U.S. and Britain held off from recognizing Tour 's independent state . Communist Bulgaria sent Guinea its first full-fledged ambassador . The Soviet Union followed soon after . By last week , things had gone so far that a U.S. State Department official grimly told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that Guinea had become Communism 's No. 1 target in Africa . Tour has channeled at least a third of his total trade ( chief exports : bananas , peanuts and coffee ) to Eastern Europe . <P> Last March Tour received a shipment of arms from Czechoslovakia that included 3,000 rifles and automatic weapons . Last week another shipment ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed alarm at the deals , Tour angrily denounced the " hostile attitude of French diplomacy . " <P> " To the Martyrs . " In the beginning , miffed at Guinea 's lone vote of no to the De Gaulle constitution , Paris had been guilty of petty harassments . But since then , Paris has stood patiently by , ready to help , though annoyed by a new motto the Guineans inscribed on a monument dedicated to the dead of World War II : " To all the martyrs of colonialism . " <P> <P> Nkrumah , too , was obviously distressed by the turn events were taking in Guinea . Tour , though capable of cracking down on those in his entourage who seem to be getting too cozy with Eastern Europe , operates like a Marxist . The two leaders , conferring through interpreters ( Nkrumah speaks English , Tour French , and they have no common African language ) , pledged themselves to find ways of " re-enforcing " their union . But actually they were far apart . While Ghana is so flush with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million five-year development program , Guinea has had to slash government salaries and adopt a budget that leaves no funds at all for development .
