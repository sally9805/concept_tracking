Day after day last week Peking 's red-pillared Hall of Encompassing Benevolence rang with the synchronized frenzy of the 1,200 trained seals who make up Communist China 's National People 's Congress . One subject not originally on the agenda caused the most heat . The subject : Tibet . " The Tibetan reactionaries , " sneered Premier Chou Enlai , " often put on pious airs and express the hope that everyone will go to heaven . But they have turned Tibet into a hell on earth . " Another speaker charged that " the British imperialists and Indian expansionists instigated the Tibetan upper-strata reactionary clique to carry out a traitorous armed rebellion . . . We want to warn the Indian expansionists . . . Please be more clear-minded ; do not lift a rock that will squash your own feet . " <P> Docile , and splendid in a silken robe , the captive Panchen Lama , 22 , was trotted out to make the right noises for his Communist masters . " Tibet , " he declared , " is always China 's Tibet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Communist leadership feeling itself beset and bellicose . As an illusion of parliamentary government in action , the People 's Congress was , of course , pure sham . But as a kind of distorted fun-house mirror of the condition of China after ten years of Communist rule , the " deliberations " of the Second National People 's Congress had their uses . <P> Speed Gets ' Em . Western specialists on Chinese affairs regard Communist statistics about their great leap forward as blatantly inflated . But instead of modifying them , the Communists multiplied them last week , making vast progress by statistical exhortation . Blandly , Chou En-lai advanced the claim that Red China 's industrial and agricultural output increased by 65% in 1958- " a speed which has never been attained and can not be attained under the capitalist system . " No less fantastic were the production targets announced for this year : 18 million tons of steel ( up 54% over 1958 ) , 380 million tons of coal ( up 41% ) , 525 million tons of grain ( up 40% ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> What Goes Up . Beneath this display of international arrogance and domestic boasts ran admissions that last year 's vaunted gains had been barely enough to keep China on the economic rails . " Since the autumn of 1958 , " admitted Finance Minister Li Hsien-nien , " there has been tension . . . owing to short supply of some non-staple foods and manufactured daily necessities in the cities . " One of the chief causes of these " temporary difficulties , " conceded Li , was the upheaval created by " such a great social change as the people 's commune movement . "
