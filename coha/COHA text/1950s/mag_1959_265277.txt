On hand to meet Harold Macmillan 's gleaming Comet 4 jet airliner at Washington 's MATS Air Terminal were Vice President Richard Nixon and Acting Secretary of State Christian Herter ( who sat waiting on a metal stool to ease the pain of his arthritis ) . They hustled the British party to the White House behind screaming sirens . Next morning Macmillan and President Eisenhower drove to Walter Reed Army Hospital , where Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had been pacing his sunroom floor awaiting their arrival . <P> Appearing thin and weary , Dulles nonetheless waved off Ike 's offer of a place on a sofa- " No , no , no " - and sat on a chair while the group posed for photographs under an Eisenhower oil portrait of Winston Churchill . The visit to Dulles , planned to last only 30 minutes , stretched on for nearly an hour as the leaders of the U.S. and Britain got down to the crisis of Berlin and West Germany . Indomitable John Foster Dulles drove home a vital point : let 's talk about East-West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Soviets granting concrete concessions for every concession granted by the West . <P> Behind Barbed Wire . An Army helicopter stood ready on the grounds of the nearby Bethesda Naval Hospital to take the President , Prime Minister and British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd ( who dislikes air travel in general and , from his appearance , helicopter travel in particular ) to Camp David , the Maryland retreat of Presidents , where Franklin Roosevelt ( who called it Shangri-La ) met in secrecy with Winston Churchill during World War II . ( Harry Truman had no use for the place . ) Some lesser lights of the British party , who followed by helicopter and car , grumbled about being tucked away in such sylvan solitude . <P> Long a close-kept secret both as to precise location and physical description , Camp David last week was briefly opened to newsmen for a rare look . Its 184 acres on the east slope of Catoctin Mountain are surrounded by a 12-ft. barbed-wire fence , with Marine sentries endlessly pacing the perimeter-at night just inside a ring of blazing spotlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees to converge on the President 's rustic-timber one-story cottage , named " Aspen " by Mamie Eisenhower . Leaning against one wall stood Dwight Eisenhower 's red and blue golf bag , while not far away is a putting green with five pitching tees ranging from 40 yds. to 120 yds.
