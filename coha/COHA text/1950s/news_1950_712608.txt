txt ATTLEE SETS FEB , 23 AS ELECTION DATE ; SOCIALISM IS ISSUE More or Less Nationalization Is Held Supreme Question for Britons to Decide ? LABOR , OPPOSITION READY Dissolution of Parliament Feb. 3 to Launch Campaign  --  New House Meets March 6 By RAYMOND DANIELL Special to THE Dim Toms TIMES . LONDON , Jan. 10 ? Britain 's election was fixed todady for Feb. 23 . On that day the people of this country will decide whether they want more or less socialism . That is the great issue before them , overshadowing all personalities , but it may be obscured as the campaign progresses by more homely considerations , such as food , housingand the weekly pay envelope . Both sides can be counted on to promise the best of two worlds  --  a capitalist paradise and a Socialist utopia . The Labor Government will point to its record of full employment and " fair shares for all " and the Conservatives wit : retort by saying that they approve all of this but could do it better for less . Prime Minister Attlee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicated it to his Cabinet and junior Ministers today . He had told the King on Sunday of his plans . The King , as was announced tonight , agreed to dissolve Parliament on Feb. 3 . This , under the British constitution , makes the date of the general election fall on Feb. 23 , as had been generally expected . Parliament now stands adjourned until Jan. 24 . But as soon as the King can summon a quorum of his Privy Counselors there will be a royal proclamation postponing the next sitting of Parliament until after the date of dissolution . New earliament Opens March 6 The new Parliament to be elected on Feb. 23 will be called into its first session for the swearingin of members and the election of a Speaker on March 1 . The King will open the new Parliament formally on March 6 . No one can tell now whether the new Parliament will be predominantly Labor or Conservative or , consequently , whether the King 's opening speech will advocate more or less socialism . It may be , al // ATTLEE SETS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that neither the Laborites nor the Conservatives will hold a clear majority , in which case it is possible that the Liberals will hold the balance of power . The leaders of all parties seemed to be satisfied with Mr. Atlee 's choice of election day . There were some members of the Prime Minister 's own party who felt that a February election was a risky business because of the vagaries of British weather but they were more numerous than influential . The Conservatives professed to welcome the challenge and the Liberals said they were ready . In any case Conservative party headquarters made it clear that it had no intention of " jumping the gun . " While the campaign has , in fact , been under way ever since the devaluation of the pound , it will not formally be launched until Parliament is dissolved . Such is the nicety of British distinctions of this sort . One reason for this precision is that there have been a good many hints from Government spokesmen that once the campaign legally begins the candidates must reckon in their campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . la other words , a Conservative candidate who is opposing nationalization being ' carried any further might have to accept responsibility for all that a corporation , fighting against nationalization , spent in his constituency on the theory that if the corporation is " agin " the Government , it is helping him . Mr. Attlee did not have to reveal the date of the election . this early . He could have waited until the night of February 3 to take full advantage of a strategic surprise . That is what most of his predecessors had done in similar circumstances . However , in giving advance notice of his intentions the Prime Minister can take credit for a patriotic act . It has been said for some time now that uncertainty about the election date was unsettling the country and impeding its march toward recovery . Now that uncertainty has been ended and the opposition parties have received double the warning that is required by law and custom . Besides , Mr. Attlee had been preserving what amounted to an open secret , for the whole country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fateful date . It had been planned to hold huge celebrations in London to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Labor party 's formation on Feb. 3 . But as this is the date for the opening of the campaign it is expected that notices will go out tomorrow canceling all these arrangements .
