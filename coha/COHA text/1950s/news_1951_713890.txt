txt Letters to The Times Restoring Currency Parities Timeliness of Revaluation as Brake on Inflation Questioned To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In support of your view and that of the International Monetary Fund that the present time is inopportune for revaluing European currencies , I should like to touch upon a few additional aspects of the question . For some time I have been concerned about the fascination which the recovery of the British gold and dollar reserves since the devaluation in September , 1949 , has held for those concerned with such matters . True , the gold and dollar holdings of the sterling area have risen from $1,375,000,000 to $3,758,000,000 since the devaluation . But in the same period the price of many raw materials has risen two and even three fold . The sterling area has gained from these boom prices by replenishing its coffers with gold and dollars , neglecting , however , to maintain , let alone increase , raw material inventories . Was this altogether prudent policy ? The purchasing power of these reserves in terms of international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meanwhile . At a time when every trader or manufacturer was anxious to be out of cash and tried to raise his raw material inventories the sterling area went " liquid . " Today Britain is faced with a shortage of many vital materials . Gold and dollars are of relatively little avail to overcome it . We witness , in a sense , a modern version of the Midas touch . Given , then , that the true purchasing power of the reserves has risen far less than the actual rise in figures , this may not be such an opportune moment after all for raising the dollar value of sterling . I would hazard a guess , moreover , that before the end of 1951 the dollar reserves will be lower rather than higher . The dollar earning power of the sterling area has weakened in recent weeks , due to lower wool and rubber prices , but the dollar cost of imports continues to rise persistently . Currency parities rest upon confidence more than any other factor . Currency experts have come to watch changes in reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reserves to decline , however little , a bear sentiment quite disproportionate to the underlying facts and of potentially serious consequences could readily develop . Higher parities and declining reserves make ill bedfellows . On the other hand , much speaks in favor of easing exchange controls . Freer exchanges generally help to strengthen sentiment in favor of a currency . Should the relaxation for any reason prove costly , it can be stopped without first having upset the schedule of parities . WALTER A. EVERITT . New York , June 7 , 1951 . Genocide as Policy Seen Soviet Abduction of Children , War Prisoners ' Detention Cited To THE EDITOR ( IF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his recent letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES Colonel Ben C. Limb , Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea and delegate to the United Nations , draws attention to the fact that North Korean Communists are committing acts of genocide against the native Christian population in Korea , In this they are acting in conspiracy with the Soviet Union and with Communist China . Reported instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous , as also of the deliberate destruction of Christian churches and other organizations . The ultimate aim , as charged by Colonel Limb , is to gain permanent control of the Korean peninsula by decimating its population . Colonel Limb states further that genocide in Korea is only a part of a global picture of Soviet genocide in other regions . In this connection , may I point out specifically similar Soviet acts of genocide as they are regularly practiced in the part of Germany under their control ? We have it on the authority of President Truman , on information given him by the Bishop of East Berlin , that in Eastern Germany the secret police " kidnap the children between the ages of 10 and 16 and carry them off to Moscow . And those children never come home . " This is genocide in its most outrageous form , as defined in Article II , Clause E , of the Genocide Convention . Hundreds of thousands of German prisoners of war have never been accounted for , and are either dead or still held in Russia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same article of the convention . The Government of Western Germany has been invited by the Secretary General of the United Nations to adhere to the Genocide Convention . Acceptance of the invitation is under discussion in Bonn , and when it has taken place the Bonn Government will be in a position to call the attention of the world to the genocidal acts of the Soviet Union . By that time , perhaps the United States will have ratified the convention as recommended by a special subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate headed by Senator . THEODORE W. KNAUTH . New York , June 1 , 1951 . Troop Mail From Veterans Proposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Now that American troops are going abroad again in increasing numbers , the American people have , it seems to me , renewed responsibility for sustaining the morale of the armed forces in every way possible . In every outfit there are some men who get very few letters . Here is art opportunity for veterans of World Wars I and II , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies lit which they themselves formerly served . Such letters might have a special sig ? nificance to their recipients , even when sender and recipient are unknown to each other , because of the organize , . tional tie . In no better way , I think , can the men now in our armed services be made aware that they are a part of a continuing tradition greater than them ? selves ? a , tradition which they have an obligation to uphold and enhance and in which it is a privilege to share . HAROLD C. BAILEY . New York , June 8 , 1951 . Medical School Admissions Discriminatory Practices Charged In New York State Colleges To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Dr. Philip B. Armstrong , in a letter to the editor of THE NEW YORK TIMES published on June 5 , declares himself " incensed " by my request , based on what he labels a " biased survey " of the New York State medical school treatment of scholarship winners , that the State Department of Education investigate the admissions practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I drew the " erroneous conclusion " that discrimination is proved by the greater number of applications filed by Jewish and Catholic than by Protestant medical scholarship winners . Dr. Armstrong has misunderstood the import of the American Jewish Congress survey . The charge that some schools were discriminating was not based on the number of applications filed by the various religious groups but on the different treatment accorded these applications . Differences in the scholastic records of the scholarship winners were insignificant : 58 per cent of the Jewish applications and 52.9 per cent of the Protestant and Catholic applications were impressive enough to be granted interviews . Nevertheless , only 46.5 per cent of the Jewish group interviewed were accepted , as contrasted with 52.9 per cent of the Catholic group and 86.7 per cent of the Protestant group interviewed ( excluding withdrawn applications ) . Law Versus Practices This statistically significant differ . ence was reported , not to indict the interview technique as such or the " fallible but * * * honest " admission , . committees , which Dr. Armstrong rise ! to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's atten. tion the fact that the New York Fait Educational Practices Law , passed in 1948 , has not eliminated discrimina. tory policies or practices . It should hardly be necessary to remind Dr. Armstrong that many impartial investigations conducted between 1945 and 1948 ( including studies by the President 's Commission on Higher Education , the American Council on Education , the New York Mayor 's Committee on Unity and the New York City Colin . dl ) attested to continuing and flagrant imposition of the discriminatory quota system against Jewish and Italian applicants to medical schools , The New York City Council in 1946 spent considerable time investigating this " cosmopolitan " approach of Cornell University Medical School which Dr. Armstrong praises . At that time Cornell Medical School officers protest . ed , as Dr. Armstrong does , that it was merely avoiding " narrow provincialism " and was not giving consideration to the ethnic affiliation of applicants . Ethnic Origins Discussed However , during the hearings one faculty member serving on the Medical School admissions committee openly admitted prejudice against certain minority groups ; several others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ethnic background of candidates . The evidence included a letter written by Dr. William Ladd in 1940 , when he was Dean of Cornell University Medical School , which stated : " We limit the number of Jews admitted : * * * we take in from 10 to 15 per cent Jews . " It was this evidence of a quota sys ? tern directed against Jews and other ethnic groups which inspired the fair educational practices law . Our scholarship survey was designed to test the effectiveness of that law . The results of the survey unfortunately indicate continuing , discrimination . A full investigation is necessary so that once and for all the people of the State of New York may be assured that race or religion plays no part in the selection of medical students . The medical schools themselves should we/A come such an investigation . SHAD POLIES , Chairman , Commission on Law and Social Action , American Jewish Congress .
