PORTRAIT OF A MAN UNKNOWN ( 223 pp. ) - Nathalie Sarraute - Brazil Braziller ( $3.50 ) . <P> At first glance , France 's acclaimed Nathalie Sarraute ( 56 ) writes like a woman who has lost her novelist 's wits . Her characters are anonymous , shadowlike creatures who seem to take turns living first in feverish madness , then in tiresome mediocrity . They know each other , but what binds them together is neither friendship nor love but a mixture of sickly attraction and grisly revulsion . Jean Paul Sartre , contributing an enthusiastic forward , explains : " If we take a look at what goes on inside people , we glimpse a moiling of flabby , many-tentacled evasions . . . Roll away the stone of the commonplace and we find running discharges , slobberings , mucous ; hesitant amoeba-like movements . Nathalie Sarraute 's vocabulary is incomparably rich in suggesting the slow , centrifugal creeping of these viscous , live solutions . " <P> Compulsive Eye . The hero of Portrait of a Man Unknown is a potbellied Frenchman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging parents . That is about all the reader ever finds out about him . Most of his time seems to be spent in checking up on the activities of an old maid and her father . Both father and daughter were born under the sign of French avarice . The girl whines and begs for money , the father accuses her of hoarding what he gives her . One night he dashes barefoot and in his nightgown into the kitchen , climbs a chair and looks at the bar of soap on a high shelf . No doubt about it , " she had cut off a large piece , almost a good third . " So now he had her - " like the butter last year , and the shoe polish ... " <P> Like a compulsive private eye , the hero avidly watches over the years as father and daughter become almost subhuman in their batterings at each other 's dignity and sense of decency . What drives him is a need to break through the outer shells of people and look through to the frightening inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself is a weak schizophrenic who sees the world and normal people masked against him . Spying on his own inner self , or on the girl and her father , becomes more important to him than anything that can happen in the workaday world , which in any case he thinks is a fraud . The girl is not unlike him : " She picks up the scent of things people are ashamed of ; she sniffs at implied meanings , follows through the traces of hidden humiliations , unable to break away from them . " <P> New Realists . Madame Sarraute , the Russian-born wife of a Paris lawyer , has been acclaimed a leader of a group called the New Realists , who urge a new kind of objectivity , which is at once both more detached and more intense . " In this future universe of the novel , " says Novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet , the group 's titular leader , " gestures and objects will be ' there , ' before being ' something ' ; and they will still be there afterwards , hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . No longer will objects be merely vague reflections of the hero 's vague soul . "
