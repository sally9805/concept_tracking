Some 60,000 fans waited hopefully for Quarterback Y. A. Tittle to sneak for the inches and keep the 49ers moving . On the sidelines , a slim , dapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks like Jimmy Cagney after two Miltowns , waved his arm . The 49er punting team trotted on the field and Rookie Fullback Larry Barnes sliced the kick off the side of his foot for a net advance of three yards , and the stands howled their dismay . // " If I had been playing quarterback instead of coaching , I 'd have called the sneak without a second thought , " Frankie Albert said the other day . " But you get real conservative when you start coaching . When I was playing , I never thought about a play failing . " // When Albert was quarterback of the 49ers , he gambled with a wild consistency which always kept the fans and the other team confused . His favorite play was a suicidal bootleg which sent him scurrying , alone and small , into the face of the giant linemen of the defense , his only protection the almost magical ability he had to deceive the opposition . He played seven years for the 49ers and then tried to give up football . // " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day , seated at his desk in the 49ers ' Redwood City office , some 30 miles from San Francisco , " so I came back and begged Tony Morabito for a job with the 49ers . " Morabito put Albert in charge of promotion for a year , then made him an assistant to Head Coach Red Strader . When Strader left at the end of the 1955 season , Albert took over . He has a strong , confident voice and he runs his practices from a high , movable platform overlooking the practice field and offers occasional comment , most of it laudatory. // " We 're still a year or so away , " he said . " It takes a long time to build up in this league . Coaching is a terrible job when you 're losing . You worry . I used to worry up until 2 o'clock of game day when I was a player , but after the kickoff , it was fun . It was hard fun , but it was fun . Now I worry right on through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to talk about it to anyone , win or lose . You get so tired of it . You play it over and over in your mind until you get sick of it . // " Sometimes I think I ought to get out of football , " he said . " Maybe I 'm not dedicated enough . But I work hard at it here . And I never have found anything else I like as well . I feel I belong in football . "
