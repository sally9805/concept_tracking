Not So Bad for England " If you ca n't sing at Covent Garden , " rumbled a British opera star , " you damn well ca n't sing anywhere . " The stage floor of London 's Royal Opera House sags and some of its scenery dates back to 1908 , but the theater 's acoustics are still near perfect . This week , slightly faded but resonant , Covent Garden celebrates its 100th birthday in a gala performance for the Queen . The generous birthday package includes extracts from The Bohemian Girl , The Trojans , Peter Grimes , Aida , I Puritani ( Maria Callas singing ) , plus the Royal Ballet 's Birthday Offering . <P> For Britons , Covent Garden shimmers with memories of empire and artistry in opera 's most florid era , when Victoria 's passion for singers helped make London the goal of every topflight musician . Its history goes back even farther , to two Covent Gardens before it . In 1732 Actor John Rich , who had rented the site , a convent-garden , built a prose theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . After a devastating fire , the theater was rebuilt in 1809 , later named the Royal Italian Opera House .

In the third Covent Garden , designed 100 years ago by Architect Edward Barry , the fires have been artistic or temperamental , set by such prima donnas as Giulia Grisi , Nellie Melba , Emma Albani . In the ' 90s , Adelina Patti , who imperiously ignored rehearsals , once filled the stage with detectives disguised as supers to guard her diamonds . Famed Manager Augustus Harris made Covent Garden London 's choicest nightspot for rich and royal patrons who came to monocle each other-and protested violently when he doused the house lights during performances . <P> Audiences as well as performers were finally called to order by the batons of great conductors-Sir Thomas Beecham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who began conducting at Covent Garden in 1910 , often whirled on the audience to snap : " Shut up !

Having survived its roles as a furniture warehouse in World War I and a dance hall in World War II , Covent Garden is blooming as radiantly as the famed flower market at its doorstep . The home of the Royal Ballet ( formerly Sadler 's Wells ) , it gives Londoners an almost year-round season of first-rate ballet and fine opera , although , in the opera department , Covent Garden is not in the same league as the Big Three ( the Metropolitan , La Scala and the Vienna Staatsoper ) . But it has the daring to experiment with difficult new productions , e.g. , its mounting last year of Berlioz ' mammoth The Trojans , which no other opera house had attempted in a single evening since Berlioz ' death .
