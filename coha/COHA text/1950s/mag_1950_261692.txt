The chief problem before the Foreign Ministers of the twelve North Atlantic Treaty nations in London was the common defense . The strategic outline prepared by the Western defense ministers at The Hague had been ambitious , but expensive . When the Western finance ministers cried that the required military expenditures would wreck Western Europe 's recovery program , the U.S. suggested-as it often had before-that one way of saving money was to avoid duplication of defense tasks . <P> Last week the Foreign Ministers agreed on an overall Western defense concept along these lines : the U.S. would provide the bulk of strategic bombing aircraft and heavy naval forces ; the British would concentrate on tactical light bombing and fighter forces ; the French would supply the bulk of the West 's land forces . <P> Cold War or Hot War . The British would obviously not disband their infantry and rely entirely on the French , nor would they sink the Royal Navy and count on the U.S. fleet . Both the British and the French would need some all-round forces to maintain their overseas possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had yet to be ratified by their governments and parliaments . Yet a pattern of efficient , integrated defense had at last been laid down . The London plan constituted progress unthinkable five years ago . That fact was promptly acknowledged by the Red press , which sputtered about " infringement of national sovereignty . " <P> To help the pattern become reality , the Atlantic Council set up a new , permanent , overall executive committee , to be headed-by tacit consent among the Allies-by an American . ( Suggested for the job : onetime Under Secretary of State Robert A. Lovett , ECA Troubleshooter Averell Harriman , General Ike Eisenhower . ) The members of the new committee-their diplomatic rank will be that of deputies to the Foreign Ministers-will run the cold war and integrate the West 's defenses for a hot war if it should come . <P> Free Men or Slaves ? The Atlantic Council also : 1 ) set up a North Atlantic planning board for ocean shipping , to coordinate the West 's merchant shipping in case of emergency ; 2 ) provided for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Marshall Plan organization ) so that plans can be made for some sort of U.S. help after 1952 , when the Marshall Plan ends ; 3 ) assured Greece , Turkey and Iran that , although they are not members of the North Atlantic Treaty , the U.S. and its Allies retained a " deep interest " in their security . <P> At the council 's concluding session , which was open to newsmen and the public , the tired , rumpled Foreign Ministers appeared on a stage in London 's Lancaster House to read a dozen suitable speeches . It was ailing Ernie Bevin who raised his tired head from his hands to express the spirit of what he called the " great Atlantic brotherhood . " Said he : " We firmly believe that in the end the free man can never be vanquished by the slave . " <P> It had been a hopeful week for free men .
