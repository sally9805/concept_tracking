Glistening , growing Denver ( pop . 511,800 ) had a dynamic mayor in Will Faust Nicholson . An Ivy Leaguer ( Dartmouth , ' 22 ) , he made a good marriage ( to the daughter of a Cripple Creek mining man ) , a good career ( investment banking , real estate ) and a good name ( twice elected as a Republican to the state senate ) . He was elected nonpartisan mayor of Denver in 1955 by only 802 votes , but Big Nick was marked well for the future by his good Republican connections in the state . Long , lanky ( 6 ft. 3 in. , 180 Ibs. ) and handsome , he sported a friendly , lopsided smile , drove himself hard . Last week it was clear that Big Nick , 57 , had driven himself too hard ; the people of Denver , smarting under Big Nick 's whiplashing insistence on a new city payroll tax , lashed back-and-well , he could always go back to real estate . <P> Big Nick 's problem was no different from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : how to raise cash for increased municipal services and capital improvements when more and more of the people who work in the city-and demand the improvements-live in and spend their dollars in the suburbs . Early in his term Big Nick set up committees to study Denver 's needs and to find ways and means of raising the money for an improvement program . The mayor 's own suggestion : a city income tax . To the folks in metropolitan Denver , who already pluck the petals off their salaries for federal and state income taxes and state and city sales taxes , this seemed a big nick indeed . They said so bluntly . Even more bluntly , the mayor persisted . <P> Tea Bags &; Insults . Disregarding recommendations of his own citizens ' committee ( which suggested a bond issue and such new service charges as a trash-collection and auto users ' fee ) , the mayor and his nine-man city council adopted an income tax ordinance without a public vote . Shouts of outrage echoed in the Rockies , as the Denver citizenry dramatized memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings and crying , " No taxation without representation ! " * Newspapers took sides , and , surprisingly , the hard-hit Chamber of Commerce , figuring that the tax would drive still more people into the suburbs , lined up against the mayor . Organized labor supported Big Nick . <P> The mayor himself was incensed . Driving near a Denver shopping center one day , he saw an anti-tax woman circulating petitions , climbed out of his car to demand that she be chased off the property . Publicly , he charged that his biggest opposition came from " non-Denverites and crackpots , " and so alienated the few leading businessmen and professional men who had remained on the sidelines . On public panel programs he would all but stop the show by insulting his opponents . When a petition was circulated for his recall , Big Nick allowed that he would like to sign it , " because I would like to see what these people look like . " In bounced three sponsors of the petition ; the mayor read and signed it , after asking attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This petition is full of it . "
