OUT OF RED CHINA ( 269 pp. ) - Liu Shaw-tong - Duell , Little ( $4 ) . <P> As a jobless ex-college student in the middle of a Peking winter , young Liu Shaw-tong was a pushover for the poster . <P> It read : " For the development of the Revolution , a ' Southbound Working Group ' will be organized . . . All except the pregnant and the illiterate are qualified to join . " <P> The Southbound Working Group was a kind of boot camp for potential Red bu reaucrats , and for a political innocent like Liu , it turned out to be quite a school . <P> In one year ( 1949 ) , his curriculum ranged from semi-starvation to marching till his feet blistered , from writing whoppers as a " People 's Correspondent " for the New China News Agency , to a minor post with the Ministry of Propaganda - while inwardly he fought to keep Mao Tse-tung and gang from using his brain as a Marxist sewage disposal dump . <P> When he escaped to Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend asked : <P> " What 's it like in Red China ? " Liu Shaw-tong replied : " Would you understand me , dear friend , if I told you that I saw an old woman weep because the sun had died in China ? " The dead sun - Author Liu scarcely needs to say - is the one that once shed the light of freedom and humanity in China . <P> Comes the Revolution . Author Liu approached Chinese Communism with an open but not a blank mind . He found that its pose was " liberation " but its practice was tyranny . The power that runs through his book is the high moral voltage an honest man always generates when he gives a straight account of a crooked thing . <P> The first assignment of the Southbound Working Group looked easy : each mem ber had to write an autobiography . But Liu found that no autobiography was accepted by the group chiefs unless the writer tagged himself a member either of " the squeezing class or the squeezed class , " reviled his father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the Nationalist government - confessed to being an " accessory thug " of the " reactionary looting class . " Next came reports in " creative history " ; one of the most successful told how the Chinese Communist Party had united China and won the war against Japan . Anyone who failed to grasp this was rebuked for not being a " clear-thinking person . " <P> One day Communist General Lin Piao , Mao 's No. 1 man , came to address the group . " All you comrades came here for the Revolution , right ? " <P> " Right ! " shouted the well-drilled members of the Southbound Working Group . <P> " Well , right now , the Revolution needs you most in the army , " said the general . " I hereby announce . . . your voluntary enlistment . " <P> One volunteer who tried to skip camp was shipped north for further " study . " <P> Assigned to become " People 's Correspondents " with the Fourth Field Army , <P> Author Liu and 31 others were crammed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the other half to him self . When they complained , they were told that " suffering is the diet of the hero . "
