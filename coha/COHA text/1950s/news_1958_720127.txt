txt New York Central Railroad , amid losses on passenger and parcel express service , said it plans to pull out of Railway Express Agency , effective January 1 , 1900 . Alfred E. Perlman , the road 's president , said the carrier feels a more efficient and satisfactory method can , be developed for handling small express shipments . The road is losing $11 million a year on its express operation , he said , and withdrawal from the agency is expected to be of great help in putting its passenger service on a sound basis . He explained that such express shipments are carried on passenger trains , and losses on that servile " make up a substantial portion of the passenger deficits of the Central . " Several leading Eastern railroads have been considering withdrawal from Railway Express , which is a jointly-owned agency that handles express shipments for the roads . A 1958 railroad cost study , the latest available , showed that Railway Express costs exclusive of Federal taxes and a return on investment were running 860.4 million more than revenues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency 's costs and revenues is less favorable to them than to Western and Southern roads . Move is Surprise to Others Nevertheless , the Central 's announcement of plans to withdraw from the agency at this time apparently carne as a surprise to many Eastern rail men . Railroad sources in New York said that the leading Eastern carriers recently agreed to delay plans to pull out of the agency in hopes that a re-apportionment of costs and revenues can be worked out with Western and Southern roads . Railway Express is owned by 68 railroads . The New York Central System , which includes its affiliated lines , Is the largest single stockholder in Railway Express with about 14% of the stock . In Philadelphia , a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Railroad would concede only that its express operation is under review . " When a decision is made , there will be an announcement , " he noted Other Eastern tail men , however , said they believe the Pennsy will remain in Railway Express until the matter can be discussed further with Western and Southern carriers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Haven &; Hartford and the Delaware . Lackawanna &; Western railroads indicated they have no present plans to withdraw from the agency Wee:ern railroad officials . meeting In Chicago to discuss the express situation , called upon Eastern carriers to put off any withdrawal from Railway Express until April 30 , presumably to allow time for a re-apportionment of costs and revenues to be worked out . Reaction of Western Roads Clair M. Roddewig , president of the Association of Western Railways , said in Chicago yesterday that the Western railroads will have to drop out of Railway Express if the major Eastern railroads do . " Continuation of the Railway Express business in its present form without participation by the Eastern railroads would be an impracticable arrangement , " he said " It would create grave financial responsibilities for the Western carriers which they are not in a position to assume " Mr Roddewig indicated later , however , that withdrawal of only the New York Central would not mean the Western roads would terminate agency contracts . Officials of major Western railroads privately indicated any action they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania Railroad leaves the pact They also seemed in doubt whether the New York Central 's withdrawal means only that it no longer will he an owner of the agency , or also means it will refuse to haul express shipments Some felt express still could be moved if the Central is the only road to withdraw from the agreement . Alfred L. Hammel , president of Railway Express , said in New York that he is aware " in a general way " that other Eastern roads are re-evaluating their membership in the organization . He added , however , that none of these has indicated to him any plans to di od out of the agency Other carriers may " no , nzcessarily " follow the Central 's lead , he said Mr Hammel said it is too early to tell what impact the Central 's withdrawal will have on the agency 's operations . The Central said alternative arrangements for handling express-type traffic may he worked out during the year before the road 's withdrawal becomes effective .

It is understood that some Eastern carriers favor handing the express service over to freight forwarders Freight forwarders consolidate groups of small shipments Into carload , or truckload , lots and ship them to their destination . Railway Express was incorporated in 1928 It is a non-profit agency that moves packages between cities , primal Ily on passenger trains , and provides pick-up and delivery service with its own trucks . The agency 's revenues in 1957 were $367.6 million , of which $118 million was paid to the railroads and other carriers for hauling express . In granting the agency permission to raise rates by 15% last October , the Interstate Commerce Commission told the agency to improve its service . The commission said that air freight rates are sometimes lower than those of Railway Express , and added that freight , forwarder service is available in most major cities at 50% of rail express charges . The Central notified Railway Express of its plans to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This provides that a road may withdraw anytime after the end of 1958 , but only on 18 months ' notice . However , a road may pull out on 12 months ' notice if other carriers have filed notice of withdrawal . At the end of last June , two small railroads gave notice of cancellation of their contracts , effective January 1 , 1980.
