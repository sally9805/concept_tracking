txt The three-coast maritime work stoppage that threatens to immobilize most American-flag shipping gained momentum yesterday , with no indication of an early settlement . The possibility that the tie-up might be prolonged indefinitely increased as Federal mediators tried unsuccessfully to arrange further talks between the disputants , except on the West Coast where some progress was reported . The stoppage , which both labor and management have diligently refrained from labeling a " strike " or " walkout , " began at midnight Friday . It resulted from the failure of three Congress of Industrial Organization affiliates to negotiate a new two-year contract with shipowners . The unions involved are the National Maritime Union , the American Radio Association and the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association . Thus far , the unions have refused to budge from their original demands . These include a fortyhour work week at sea in lieu of the present forty-eight hours , a 25 per cent increase in pay , industrywide paid vacations and adjustment of so-called inequities . To provide the vacations each employer is asked to contribute 50 cents a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed in a fund set up for the purpose . Wage scales in the National Maritime Union now range upward from $248 a month for able-bodied seamen ; those in the engineers ' union from $378 for third assistant engineers , and in the radio operators ' organization from $352 . Companies ' Offer Rejected The Committee for the Companies and Agents , Atlantic and Gulf Coast , acting in behalf of forty operators , have been equally adamant since making a " package " offer to the unions two weeks ago . This offer provided for a 3.62 per cent pay rise , vacations to be financed by the shipowners at the rate of 35 cents a day for each man employed and called for a joint committee to study inequities . The unions flatly rejected this offer and no further proposals were advanced by either side . Yesterday , however , Joseph Curran , president of the N. M. U. and chairman of the group negotiating in behalf of the seamen , declared in an interview in his office : " We do n't want to see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned the operators are in a position to see that it does n't last long by coming in with a new offer . The negotiations can be opened up again . We are still willing to negotiate provided the operators will put something on the table . " He said he referred to better conditions obtainer ' by the West Coast seamen from the . game companies holding contracts with the N. M. U. on the East and Gulf coasts . Shipowners in Strategy Session The shipowners involved met for more than five hours yesterday in in apparently fruitless strategy session at the offices of the American Merchant Marine Institute , 11 Broadway . Spokesmen for the group said later that they reached no decisions and felt there was no new basis for talks with mediators w the unions . Meanwhile , Clyde M. Mills , assistant director of the Federal Slediation and Conciliation Servce , said he had given a full report ) f the situation to Cyrus S.

Dougherty expected to confer vith company repres9ntatives tolay . After these discussions , he ; aid , " I hope we will be able to wing the two factions together . " le declined , however , to predict when talks might be resumed . The only union involved on the West Coast is the A. R. A. , which was reported yesterday to be picketing more than a score of ships after breakdown of negotiations between the organization and the Pacific Maritime Association , which was acting in behalf of West Coast employers . Later in the evening negotiations were resumed and some progress was reported . Union officials taking part in the discussions expressed optimism that a break might develop soon . Spokesmen in the industry admitted that it was too early yet to analyze the effect . of the stoppage on export cargo .

Passenger Carriers Hard Hit The situation threatens to be considerably more menacing in the passenger field . Outbound traffic is now at its peak for the year and is destined to be heavy for ? eral more weeks . Thus , it would be virtually impossible for a major foreign carrier to accept more than a few additional bookings . Also impeded by the stoppage was the movement of overseas mail . Three Europe-bound vessels and one due to depart for the West Coast yesterday were loaded with mail over the week-end . None was able to get away from here . Meanwhile , a post office spokesman disclosed that , in the absence of any directive from postal officials , the mail would continue to be assigned to American-flag ships . Only one major American-flag passenger liner arrived here yesterday . She was the American Export vessel Independence , sister ship of the Constitution . She will be removed to a drydock in Brooklyn today and is not scheduled to sail again until July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following her removal . Seventy Ships Tied Up Here Of seventy ships berthed in the Port of New York yesterday , nearly one-half were to have departed between Friday night and last night , but all were prevented from doing so . Nine passenger ships , with more than 1,000 pas , sengers already booked , are scheduled to sail this week If the stoppage continues there is little likelihood that any of them will move . Eight of the ships are manned by N. M. U. crews and the other has a contract with the M. E. B. A. , though its remaining departments are manned by American Federation of Labor seamen . The liners involved are the new luxury vessel Constitution , set to leave Thursday on her maiden voyage to the Mediterranean with a. capacity list of passengers ; the Panama liner Cristobal , the Farrell ship African Endeavor , the American Export 's Excalibur , the United Fruit ship Jamaica , the three Grace liners Santa Paula , Santa Luisa and Santa .

The African Endeavor is now in Baltimore and her crew refused yesterday to bring the ship here . Seven cargo ships have been tentatively scheduled to depart from New York today but all are manned by N. M. U. crews . Nearly fifty additional ships were reported during the day to have been deserted by their crews in other Atlantic and Gulf ports . The unions placed the total of affected ships on these coasts at eighty . Almost half as many more vessels were known to be idle at West Coast ports from San Pedro to Tacoma . Wash . Defense Shipments Moved Meanwhile , seven additional craft had either been cleared or were about to be cleared as carriers of defense or essential cargoes . The decision as to which con , signments belonged in this category was being left entirely at the discretion of the Government . Soon after noon the N. M.

" The maritime unions , " the telegram read , " take the position that the National Shipping Authority should be the central Government agency to designate the essential vessels to .. ? the unions ' national headquarters . They in turn will clear the ship by contact with the appropriate port . " Canadian Strike Looms VANCOUVER , June 18 ( Canadian Press ) ? The Seafarers International Union , A. F. L. , said tonight it would strike at midnight Friday unless the companies met its wage demands .
