Of the 18 papers in his empire , the late William Randolph Hearst was fondest of the San Francisco morning Examiner ( circ. 225.000 ) . Beyond being the No. 1 paper in San Francisco , it has long been the best in the Hearst chain , and The Chief gave it a measure of freedom that he granted to no other . The man who won and well used his independence : Publisher Clarence Richard Lindner , who was as different from most Hearst executives as the Examiner is from other Hearstpapers . <P> A plump , scholarly man with a connoisseur 's taste for fine wines and first editions , Lindner 's erudition awed his staff . He was an authority on the theater , a patron of the opera and symphony , a collector of Japanese prints and a dryly witty talker on such topics as 19th century literature . Largely self-taught , he was graduated from Manhattan 's DeWitt Clinton High School and worked on several magazines and dailies as a reporter , ad manager and editor before he was spotted by Hearst 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on as his assistant . At 31 , Newsman Lindner was sent to Detroit to run the ailing Detroit Times , which Hearst had just bought . Lindner borrowed money from the bank to meet his first payroll , turned the Times into a moneymaker . He was moved up to run the New York American , and in 1929 sent west to be boss of the Examiner . <P> As publisher of the Examiner , he shied away from canned Hearst projects , built its circulation to the highest in the city by " putting out a neighborhood paper for the guy next door . " A quiet , popular boss with an impassive face and bearing of a benevolent Buddha , Lindner let Managing Editor William Wren run the paper , except for occasional suggestions . Almost every day until The Chief became too ill , Lindner was on the phone talking to him , advising old W.R. on financial and editorial matters , listening attentively to " suggestions , " adopting some , diplomatically talking The Chief out of others . Lindner was one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his points . But he never said so . Once , when asked by an acquaintance what he thought of President Truman 's policies , Lindner gave one of his usual dry , diplomatic replies : " I work for Mr. Hearst and therefore have no opinions . " <P> Last week , in his three-story house high atop San Francisco 's Telegraph Hill , Clarence Lindner , 62 , died of a heart attack . His chief competitor , the San Francisco Chronicle 's Editor Paul Smith , provided an epitaph : " I respected Lindner because he outdid me on everything I ever tried to do . " <P> Publisher Lindner 's successor : Charles Mayer , 48 , a Lindner protg who went to the Examiner in 1926 direct from the University of California , has been business manager for the past 22 years .
