txt FULL TRUCE SESSION IN KOREA IS PUT OFF AT ALLIES ' REQUEST Last-Minute Note to Foe Gives Unavoidable Circumstances ' as Reason for the Move NEW COURSE CONSIDERED U. N. Aides Believed Studying What to Do as Result of Red Break-Up of Prisoner Talk By LINDESAY PARROTT Special to Two NEW YORK Timm , TOKYO , Sunday , April 27 ? A , session of the full delegations negotiating for an armistice in the Korean war was canceled this morning shortly before it was scheduled to begin . No explanation was given for calling off the meeting , which would have been the first held by the full delegations since midFebruary . Notice of the move was given by Allied liaison officers at Panmunjom an hour before the scheduled plenary session , which was to have begun at 11 A. M. 9 P. M. Saturday , Eastern standard time . The formal message , handed over by Air Force Col. Andrew J. Kinney , said the request was a result of " unavoidable circumstances , " but indicated that a postponement , rather than total cancellation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be informed through liaison officers as to the date proposed for this plenary session , " the United Nations note said . Brig . Gen. William P. Nuckols , spokesman at Allied advance headquarters , later told correspondents , " I can not in any way amplify this move . " Foe Raises No Objection General Nuckols said he had no knowledge when the Allied command might be ready for the session . It was announced that the Communists had raised no objection to the delay . The assumption was that the Allied representatives were not ready to suggest what course should be followed as a result of the break-off by the Communists of secret staff meetings dealing with an exchange of prisoners after the start of the armistice and the deadlocked discussions over terms for enforcement of the truce . The staff officers on the latter point  --  Item 3 of the agenda  --  met for half an hour today , continuing , the series of sessions that have made no. progress for the last week . The plenary meeting was scheduled in an exchange of messages yesterday between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and North Korean Lieut . Gen. Nam II . The Communists broke off the secret sessions of the staff officers on a prisoner exchange when they learned that only 70,000 of more than 132,000 Chinese and North Korean captives held in Allied camps would choose to return under the principle of voluntary repatriation , In the exchange of notes with General Nam , Admiral Joy made it plain that the United Nations expected the proposed plenary session to have the broadest possible , scope . As opposed to subdelegations and the staff committees , which had a single subject assigned to each for negotiation , the full delegations are empowered to discuss any and , all material connected with the // armistice . Thus , if the United Nations had a new proposal to make after the collapse of the prisoner talks and the deadlock over Item 3 , of the agenda it well might be meat of the truce ? it well might made before the plenary session . The full delegations also alone would be able to discuss any plan to exchange a concession on one agenda item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue are Communist demands for inclusion of the Soviet Union as one of the " neutral " nations to control the cease-fire and , for the right to build airfields without restriction in North Korea . There have been hints the enemy might be willing to waive Soviet participation in exchange for more favorable terms on airfields than have been offered . In addition , the truce talks still have not settled Item 5 of the agenda , dealing with recommendations for an international political conference , after the start of the armistice , on fundamental issues in Korea . The Allied delegation agreed to a Communist draft of the proposed article but the enemy delegation then withdrew the text for ' further study by staff officers and promised to notify the United Nations when staff sessions might begin . This notification has not been received . Therefore , there are three main agenda items with which the plenary sessions eventually would have to deal . Under the agreement for the truce talks all settlements must be made by the full delegations , and the subcommittees and staff groups have authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the United Nations side that made the request for new full-dress sessions there was some speculation here that a fresh proposal for a settlement , if any was forthcoming , would be presented by the Allied representatives . However , the suggestion had no official confirmation here , and the official Peiping radio made it plain this morning that the enemy was prepared to accept no such settlement of the prisoner issue as had been proposed at the secret staff meetings . The broadcast repeated that " voluntary repatriation " was a scheme to withhold tens of thousands of Chinese and North Korean soldiers . Peiping stressed , however , what previously had been indicated by the Communist staff officers  --  that they might be willing to " make adjustment for special cases " of prisoners who threatened to resist forcibly their transfer across the border . The concession was a somewhat limited one , applying only to South Koreans captured , from the enemy forces by the United Nations .                   @ @
