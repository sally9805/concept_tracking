" But he added that the U.S. , until it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely taken on a somewhat different guise and that its fundamental objective is still to disrupt and in the end to dominate the free nations . . . <P> Needless to say , we do not intend to permit specific Soviet moves to control our activities .
