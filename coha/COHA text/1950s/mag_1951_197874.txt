Dr. Charles S. Cameron , scientific director of the American Cancer Society , said last week : <P> " There is reason to believe that cancer will not be undone by a bolt from the blue , by any dramatic and decisive breakthrough , but rather will it give way before persistent research ... We must resign ourselves to whittling away at this mass of mystery , and gradually , imperceptibly , the truth will emerge , so that a historian of the future . . . will not be able to fix the day or the month or the year when victory was achieved . "
