txt WASHINGTON , Jan , 18 ? The Army announced , today that it planned a major overhaul of the organized Reserve Corps aimed at improving its combat readiness . At the heart of the program , which will be worked out in detail in the next few months , is a plan to build the reserves into 9,000 strong units rather than 18,000 organizations , and to standardize on one type of unit that could be readily mobilized in an emergency Announcing the general framework of a revamped reserve Army , Gordon Gray , Secretary of the Army , declared that the Army intended to maintain on a troop basis " only those units absolutely necessary for early mobilization . " In outline the Army proposes to establish three well-defined categories , f a ' Reserve Army , the Active Reserve , the Inactive Reserve and an Honorary Reserve . The plans call for the Active Reserve to be made up of an Organized Reserve and a Volunteer Reserve . The members of the first group would be composed of personnel in units needed upon a mobilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this group in the volunteer section Would be individual officers and enlisted men needed for the expansion of an Army of the United States in the event of an emergency . An Army announcement said the volunteer group " initially will include currently organized training units . " All that was said about the honorary reserve was that it " will be made up of personnel of long service who request such assignment . " More specifically the inactive reserve was described as that group of reservists " who can not or do not desire to participate in the active reserve , but who will be subject to call in case of emergency despite their inactive status . " The need for modification of the reserve program has been apparent to defense planners for some while . Recently the Army ordered a sharp cutback in the number of officers and men eligible to receive drill pay when it was discovered that the money appropriated for training was being exhausted ahead of schedule . The Army seriously doubted the value of the paid training in many cases . Secretary Gray said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1,945 , was " based on concepts which have since become outdated . " The old program , he added , contemplated a total strength of // ARMY TO OVERHAUL ITS RESERVE CORPS // 1,000,000 men in units plus a large number of Veservists needed for individual assignments in an emergency . As of the end of the year about 250,000 officers and men were participating in the paid drill reserve program . Mr. Gray said many of the existing units consisted of only two or three men . The recent curtailment order put 2,866 training units into a no-pay status . Mr. Gray said 625,000 officers and men would constitute " a desirable peacetime " reserve strneture . He said that the " minimum strength acceptable to the Army under existing conditions would be about 367,000 officers and men in the organized reserve . " In addition to this minimum figure , however , there must be available on M-Day some 100,000 individual male officers , 15,000 femaleofficers , 15,000 warrant officers and 200,000 enlisted men ? and it is this group that will constitute the Volunteer Reserve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting the number of units from a projected 18,000 to 9,000 Mr. Gray said there had been " m'ich trouble " in attaining the " progression " of C class units ' ( officers only ) through B class units ( officers and a cadre of enlisted men ) to A class . The latter units when fully organized have fixed percentages of officers and enlisted men . There will be only one type of unit under the new plan  --  the cadre , or B type , and these will be required to reach their status within prescribed time limits or be reorganized . It is expected that the reduction of units will result in a better distribution of available training equipment . The new program will also seek to iron out one of the Reserve Corps ' biggest problems , that of promotions . Mr. Gray acknowledged that the terminal promotions made at the war 's end produced a top-heavy grade structure in the reserve . He said , however , that this situation had been improved by " a firm troop basis i. the Organized Reserve and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that estimates showed that the annual recufring ; costs of the old Organized Reserve program would have reached about $369,000,000 . The new program is I expected to work out at an annual I cost of $153,000,000 , he explained . Full details of the program will be sent to Army commanders about April 1 .
