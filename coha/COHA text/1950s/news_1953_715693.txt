txt Less than two weeks after the unexpected . withdrawal of the ' Gaited Brotherhood of Carpenters from the American Federation of Labor , top level talks have begun looking toward speedy reaffiliation of the 822 , - 500-member union . Earlier this week , according to a high federation source , George , Meany , A. F. L. president , and William L. ( Big Bill ) Hutcheson , president emeritus of the carpenters , met quietly at an undisclosed place and went over the causes of the disaffiliation and possible cures . The outgrowth of that conference was a decision to hold another session , this time between officials of the carpenters ' union and a committee representing the executive council of the federation . The meeting is to be held within the next two weeks // Carpenters and A. AFL L. Discuss . Union 's Early Return to the Fold Contgmed From Pa0 1 and will have as its objective the re-entry of the union into the A. F. L. before the opening ? f the federation 's convention in St. Louis on Sept. 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Aug. 12 came as a complete surprise to the A. F. L. executive council , then meeting in Chicago , and most of the rest of the American labor movement  --  including members of the carpenters union . The reason given by Maurice Hutcheson , the union president and son of William L. , was that the federation had done nothing about " disruptive conditions , " meaning jurisdictional disputes , within the A. F. L.  --  and appeared to be more concerned with unity with the Congress of Industrial Organizations than with the problems of its own affiliates . No one in Chicago , including Mr. Meany , who said so publicly , took this reason very seriously . The general conclusion was that William L. Hutcheson , acting out of pique and using his old technique of threatening a walkout unless 4 got what he wanted , had been outbluffed by Mr. Meany and other council members who did nothing to stop the withdrawal . Soon after the carpenters got out , rumors began to fly that they were on their way back in again . The senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded its meeting . The next week , a source said yesterday , the carpenters sent out peace feelers through a member of the union 's executive council . If the disaffiliation of the carpenters created problems for the union and the federation , so does the contemplated return of the union to the fold . When William L. Hutcheson took his union out of the A. F. L. , he lost his post as first vice president of the federation and his seat on the executive council . Acting swiftly , the council decided to move all twelve remaining vie , . presidents up a notch . ' The thirteenth vacancy was then filled by the election of Dave Beck , leader of the powerful International Brotherhood of Teamsters . In ' addition , the council decided to recommend to the - convention the creation of two additional council positions . Problem of Hutcheson 's Seat One of the issues that will confront the committees of the A. F. L. and carpenters when they meet will be Mr. Hutcheson 's council seat . The chances are excellent that the union will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there is not much likelihood that ' Mr. Hutcheson senior will slip back into his chair as first vice president . However , there is room for a compromise . It may be suggested that one of the ' two new openings ? to be created by the convention  --  should go to Maurice Hutcheson . There remain of course , the carpenters ' complaints over federation jurisdictional disputes , particularly as they concern conflict of interests between the carpenters and the maintenance of way employes . At the council meeting two weeks ago , Mr. Meany said a plan was in the works and that it would be presented to the Convention . That plan may be the means of saving face for the carpenters and explaining the union 's reaffiliation . If and when the carpenters are reunited with , the A. F. L. a number of confusing situations will be straightened out . Mr. Meany sent lout letters earlier this week telling all city , state and central federation bodies to " disassociate and suspend " the union . In many cases this would have resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In New . York , for ' example , the secretary-treasurer of the - State Federation of Labor , Harold C. Hanover , is a member of the carpenters union . To hold his position , Mr. Hanover was said to be preparing to take out a card in the A. F. L. 's insurance union . The reaffiliation of the carpenters would finally , kill off speculation that that union was headed into a third labor federation ' to include John L. Lewis ' United Mine Workers , David J. 's United Steelworkers , C. I. 0. , and Dave Beck 's teamsters . Mr. Beck assured the federation ' after his election as thirteenth vice president that he had no plans ? and never had any  --  to take his union out . Last week Mr. assured the C. I. 0 . that he was in that group - to stay . Now the carpenters appear to be on their way back into the A. F. L. That leaves only Mr. Lewis in what haS become known as the Phantom Phederation.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
