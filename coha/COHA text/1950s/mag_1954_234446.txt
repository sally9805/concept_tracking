At 22 , Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr . said : " I positively will not go into politics . " Last week , at 39 , young F.D.R. ( Frank to his friends ) bid for the nation 's second biggest political job : governor of New York . His announcement was no surprise ; his father had stepped into the governorship ( at 46 ) before stepping up to the White House , and Junior is trying out Father 's footsteps for size . <P> Franklin Jr . not only has his father 's name , he has his looks , voice and sweeping self-assurance . He is already taking instruction two nights a week ( 7 p.m. to midnight ) on the problems of Albany . <P> He has won little distinction in five years as a Congressman ( and as 1952 campaign manager for Averell Harriman ) , but he has picked up so much political know-how that he very nearly has the gubernatorial nomination wrapped up . <P> Since January he has been visiting every one of New York 's 62 counties to gladhand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City wheels . <P> Almost everywhere the old Roosevelt magic worked ; in Batavia , with 1,767 registered Democrats , 424 bought tickets to hear a dinner speech and hundreds more were turned away . By last week he had picked up 200 upstate delegates ; he expected to have the full majority of 510 ( out of 1,018 ) by the Sept. 21 nominating convention . <P> There could be one big hitch in the plans : New York City 's five counties alone have 512 votes , mostly controlled by Tammany and Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr . Like F.D.R. Jr. , Wagner wants to follow a father 's tracks-in his case , to the U.S. Senate . Wagner too may decide that the best route to Washington runs through Albany , as it did for Senator Herbert Lehman . Or he might be persuaded to run by those New York Democrats who feel that Junior is just plain poison . But , as of last week , the chances were that in November young Roosevelt would be the candidate , running against the man his father beat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
