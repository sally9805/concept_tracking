Queen Juliana of The Netherlands last week reminded the world that the Dutch are still a colonial power in the Western Hemisphere-by graciously relinquishing part of that power . The Queen proclaimed a new Statute of the Kingdom , giving Surinam ( Dutch Guiana ) and The Netherlands Antilles complete internal self-government and requiring consultation with the motherland only on such affairs as defense and foreign relations . <P> Surinam and the six Antilles islands ( Curaao , Aruba , Bonaire , St. Eustatius , Saba and half of St. Martin ) have been Dutch colonies since the 17th century . Dutchmen gained possession of the islands by driving out the Spaniards , who did n't even put up a fight . When the Dutch also tried to push the British out of the part of Guiana now called Surinam , the British countered by seizing New Amsterdam ( Manhattan ) . Later , in the 1667 Peace of Breda , the Dutch traded off New Amsterdam ( bought from the Indians for $24 ) for 55,000 square miles in Guiana . <P> For almost a century the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they turned their attention to Java and Sumatra in the East Indies in the 19th century , the western colonies languished . The long-term investment in the west did not pay off until 40 years ago , when vast bauxite deposits were found in Surinam , and Venezuela 's Lake Maracaibo oilfields were opened . During World War II , Surinam provided 60% of the U.S. 's bauxite needs for aluminum . Huge oil refineries on Curaao and Aruba processed 72% of the crude produced in Venezuela . With this new prosperity , the Negroes , East Indians , Hindus and expatriate Netherlanders in the colonies ( 230,000 in Surinam , 174,000 on the islands ) developed political ambitions . Political parties sprang up at war 's end to demand more autonomy for the territories . In 1948 their leaders began to shuttle across the ocean for conferences at The Hague . But none demanded full independence ; the territories were well satisfied with last week 's statute that kept them an integral part of Queen Juliana 's realm .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
