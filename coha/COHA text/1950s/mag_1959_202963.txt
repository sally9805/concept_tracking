THE two-block wedge of Moscow real estate where Vice President Nixon and Soviet Premier Khrushchev held their spectacular verbal fencing matches last week is a wonder of U.S. planning , talent and do-it-yourself ingenuity . Conceived four years ago , the American exhibition in Moscow was not finally approved by the Kremlin until last December , and the fact that it was ready to open on schedule marked some sort of speed record for major international expositions . <P> Handsomely situated among the lofty old pines of Sokolniki Park , a former czarist preserve , the fair is a wonderful , themeless serving of American science , technology and culture . <P> At the entrance to the fair is the geodesic dome , a 78-ft. - high , aluminum , gold-anodized building based on the original design by Architect R. Buckminster Fuller , which resembles a giant , gilded armadillo shell and houses a kaleidoscope of scientific and technical exhibits . Across seven screens - which take up one-third of the interior wall space-flash keyed sets of color pictures of U.S. life ( e.g. , seven cities , seven college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score ) . This unique process was invented by Designer Charles Eames . Watching the thousands of colorful glimpses of the U.S. and its people , the Russians were entranced , and the slides are the smash hit of the fair . Another big attraction : IBM 's RAMAC 305 , an electronic brain that produces written answers in flawless Russian to any of 4.000 questions about the U.S. <P> Strangers at a Wedding . Behind the dome is the glass pavilion , a sprawling ( 50,000 sq . ft. ) building of glass and steel with an accordion-pleated aluminum roof . It is the cultural center of the exposition , with everything from a Stuart portrait of Washington to the latest model kitchen . Scrutinizing the latest American modes , the Russian women seemed most impressed by the spectacular wedding sequence . " We used to have that long ago , " said one wistful spectator . " But not any more . " <P> Among the other big-drawing displays : a pondful of gleaming new boats , an avant-garde children 's playground , the Macy-furnished ranch house , rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a leftover from the Brussels World Fair , which has been updated by Walt Disney and fitted out with a Russian sound track . On opening day , uniformed girls handed out free Pepsi-Colas from gaily painted kiosks . More than 60,000 red begonia , white chrysanthemum and blue ageratum plants splashed color through the exhibits-not out of any special patriotic fervor , but because they are the most abundant flowers in Moscow at this season . <P> Books off the Shelf . For the bedeviled director of the fair , Harold Chadick McClellan , a wealthy California manufacturer ( paints and chemicals ) , former Assistant Secretary of Commerce and onetime president of the National Association of Manufacturers , the project was one unmitigated migraine . On top of his breakneck schedule and a niggardly allowance ( $3,600,000 ) from Washington , he met daily opposition from all sides . The Kremlin vetoed the plan to distribute free Coty lipsticks . President Eisenhower 's doubts about the top-heavily modern art show ( TIME , July 13 ) prompted some changes .
