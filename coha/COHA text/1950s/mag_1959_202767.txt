In their chalet headquarters at Geneva last week , 14 top leaders of the World Council of Churches met for one of the most exciting meetings in the council 's ten-year history . Cause of the stir : Pope John 's dramatic announcement of an ecumenical council in 1961 or 1962 ( TIME , Feb. 9 ) , which will examine the question of Christian unity and may well include Protestant observers . The problem before the council : On what terms can other Christians meet with Roman Catholicism in the face of its insistence that it is the only true Christian church ? <P> For five days behind closed doors , the World Council 's executive committee warmly debated " a reply to the Pope . " It turned out to be a cautious document , expressing interest in the proposed meeting but stressing lack of information . " The question is how ecumenical will the council be in composition and in spirit ? " The committee advanced its own version of ecumenical cooperation : " Progress toward unity is made when churches meet together on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of each church to the truth of the Gospel , to charity and to a faithful interpretation of its deepest convictions . " <P> New Unity . The executive committee proposed that " fruitful first steps " should be " in actual cooperation among churches in working for a responsible society . . . and efforts to secure religious liberty for all people in every land . " Examples : unity against anti-Christian forces , collaboration in aiding refugees and underdeveloped countries-practical work that might thrive despite deep dogmatic differences . <P> Geneva corridor talk brought some sharp if still baffled evaluation of the Pope 's motives in calling the Rome meeting . Germany 's Evangelical Bishop Otto Dibelius hopefully felt that the Pope might be acknowledging the World Council 's strength ( 171 Protestant , Anglican and Orthodox churches in 53 countries , with a combined membership of close to 350 million , compared to an estimated 496 million Roman Catholics ) . Martin Niemoeller , outspoken German pacifist , envisioned a papal effort " to wean away the Eastern Orthodox churches from the World Council . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more practical experience in modern inter-church cooperation than the Vatican . But perhaps the Orthodox churches could serve as a bridge , helping the Vatican to break through its traditional isolation . " <P> A Chance to Explain . Said U.S. Lutheran Leader Dr. Franklin Clark Fry , chairman of the Geneva meeting : " Any church living in isolation tends to overemphasize what it believes to be the truth . They need the opportunity to explain their views to others . " <P> At least one high-ranking Roman Catholic priest seemed to agree . At a World Council reception in Geneva , he commented : " Let us all pray that God will give the Holy Father the strength to break through the opposition of the Curia . One must not forget that these cardinals in their ivory Vatican tower have never seen Protestants , and feel no need for contacts with something that to them does not exist . The Pope is a man of great experience . Let us hope he can make the weight of his enlightened judgment felt . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
