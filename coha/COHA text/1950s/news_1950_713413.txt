txt It will not be easy this day to keep our thoughts centered within the tight little family circle which is the traditional setting for the celebration of Thanksgiving . Most of us will not even try to shut out the painful reality that there is , for good reason , an empty chair at the table in many an American home today . In some of these homes the vacant chair will not again be filled . In others a son , or husband , or brother , or father spends this day in uniform on a distant field and the prayer that is said mingles intercession with thanks . But , as was so often the case in the long history of our Thanksgiving Days , we find that our nation and our people are ready to use this day as an occasion for proclaiming anew our courage to face the unknown . We are at war today , in the company of other peoples who feel the cause is just and honorable . Last year , on this day , we were at peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanksgiving . But we can and do say that it is cause for giving thanks that we had the courage to refuse to bow to the aggressor , that we stood fast by our principles , that we took our stand by the side of free men fighting for freedom . We could be at peace today if we had surrendered and not listened to conscience . But would we have'reason to give thanks for the peace bought at that price ? Someone has said that of all our days of celebration and festival Thanksgiving has changed least . It is a Ntholesome thing to feel and express on that day the sense of humility that springs from awareness that not all our bounty is self-made , that there is a strength within us that can not be wholly accounted for on a rational basis . This day we confess that we are not selfmade men , and that a man who was would be a poor thing indeed . What prayer of thanks to an understanding divinity ever concluded without a petition ? A divinity who so well knows human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect upon the meagerness - of what the Pilgrims first gavethanks for , three centuries ago , we should find it easier to count our blessings today . Our harvest is in , and there is plenty for all beyond the dreams of our ancestors , and won with a day of toil so short as to be occasion for ' thanks in itself . We take for granted today what the celebrants of the early Thanksgiving would have had no basis in the subconscious to dream of . Our stockades have moved to the oceanfronts . A modern magic of men 's minds has invaded the skies with the airplane , the radio wave and the television miracle . The printing press has recorded and delivered everywhere the best that man has ' thought and remembered through the ages . The freedom to worship as one will is a commonplace benefit of the American man , woman and child . The school door is freely open to anyone who will enter . Opportunity is everywhere , and less abridged for reason of race , color or creed each year . Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled has become an established concept of government , left no longer to chance . The American workingman has won : a place of dignity and decency in the scheme of things . Yes , there is a good and ample reason for giving thanks this day . We live in the shadow of terrifying doubt as to the future . But we have our great certainties , too . We know that , in con:ert with others , we have put principle ahead of personal comforts . We have cared to choose a hard way , fraught with sacrifice of life and treasure . We lave had the gratification of seeing . ested , within this past year , the interiational agency of peace on which our ; neatest hopes were based . There have seen disappointments . The peace has ) een broken , but this4agency of peace has survived and , because it has n its test , is stronger than it was a ye ago today . So we sit down together in than giving today . Some things do n change . With minor variations t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was 250 yea ago , when a young woman in Mass chusetts described it thus : " We all sal a Hymn and afterwards my dear Fath led us in a prayer , remembering 1 absent friends before the Throne Grace .
