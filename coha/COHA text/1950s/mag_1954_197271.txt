The legendary Northwest Passage , a direct water route across the top of North America , has been the goal of navigators since Explorer Henry Hudson perished trying to find it in 1611 . Norway 's famed Roald Amundsen made a trip across in the 47-ton yacht Gja in 1905 ; the 80-ton Royal Canadian Mounted Police schooner St. Roch ( TIME , Aug. 2 ) , commanded by Mountie Superintendent Henry A. Larsen , in 1942 became the first vessel to make the passage from west to east . But both Amundsen and Larsen sailed through Prince of Wales Strait , detouring around the broader , more direct but more northerly western exit : fog-shrouded , ice-choked McClure Strait . <P> Last week the U.S. Navy announced that two U.S. icebreakers , the Navy 's Burton Island and the Coast Guard 's Northwind , had successfully cut their way through McClure on a joint U.S.Canadian expedition . Neither ship made a complete passage from the Arctic to the Atlantic Ocean ; the Burton Island sailed through the Prince of Wales Strait from the west and turned around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see map ) ; the Northwind pushed eastward from the Arctic Ocean . Both ships used helicopters to scout the best passage through the ice . Unusually heavy melting of barrier ice eased the passage ; even so , the big 269-ft. icebreakers cut and crushed their way through ice four to ten feet thick . <P> Although the new shortcut made the headlines , Canadian and U.S. scientists aboard the expedition had a more important mission : taking soundings and recording data on the Arctic seas . With accurate charts , an atomic submarine , such as the U.S.S. Nautilus ( TIME , Jan. 11 ) , could cruise from the Atlantic to the Pacific under the Arctic icepack , virtually invulnerable to search and counterattack.
