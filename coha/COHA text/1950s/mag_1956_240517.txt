In Africa 's Middle Congo a kani is a wizard , and along the banks of the muddy Alima River a kani 's orders are not taken lightly . <P> In the bush village of Bokoul , the ancient Kani Eyobl was dying , so he called his sons around him ; the instructions he gave them were minute and terrifying . As soon as he died a calabash of palm wine was to be broken in the yard of his hut . Then in Eyobl 's open grave a white cockerel was to be beheaded and released . If the headless , fluttering bird flew out of the grave it was well : the dead man was on his way to the upper regions . But if the bird stayed in the grave , the dying kani darkly warned , it would be better for the people of Bokoul that they lived somewhere else . <P> <P> Old Eyobl died , and the wine was spilled . Then , as the women gathered around the dead man for the nightlong watch , a thunderstorm loomed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eyobl 's prophecy was carried out . A bolt of lightning crashed into Eyobl 's hut , and a moment later nine women lay dead around the bier . Last week Bokoul was a ghost village , in which Father Benoit Gassongo , the Roman Catholic priest and teacher , stirred among the vacant seats of the mission school and said his Mass in the empty chapel .
