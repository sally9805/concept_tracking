DRAWINGS are to paintings what letters are to public declarations , or diaries to autobiographies , or songs to symphonies . Michelangelo called drawing the basis of almost all knowledge , believing that only the outline , on paper or in mind , can make meanings clear . Master drawings merge swift emotion with analysis . They are both personal and sharp . <P> A loan exhibition at the Knoedler Art Galleries last week amounted to a miniature anthology of the best European drawing . Brought together to benefit Columbia University , and sponsored by President Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth ( who sent Signorelli 's Hercules and Antaeus , and five other drawings from Windsor Castle ) , the show included 88 of the world 's greatest .

Instead of titillating the mind with sadistic fantasies , Francisco Goya dizzies the heart with cruel fact .
