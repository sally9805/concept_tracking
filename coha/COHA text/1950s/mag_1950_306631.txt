( See Cover ) <P> " Maybe half a million Siamese know who Joe Stalin is , " said a high official of the Siamese court . " Fewer can identify Harry Truman . But everybody , right out to the most remote borders of the nation , knows about the King . " Last week , for the first time in almost four years , the Siamese got a glimpse of their King , and Siam 's 18 million cheerful , childlike citizens prepared to make the most of it . <P> For weeks past , the news of his coming had been heard amidst the clatter of traffic on Bangkok 's twisted , crowded streets . Peddlers had passed it from sampan to sampan along the winding , traffic-jammed klong ( canals ) that made Siam 's capital an eastern Venice . Strawhatted boatmen on the wider canals that crisscross the rice-rich central plains to the north had told it to farmers ' wives in houses perched on stilts . Up the great rivers , the Chao Phraya , the Mekong , the Tha Chin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone with wandering merchants thumbing barge rides . On the lips of mendicants with shaven heads and shaven eyebrows it had traveled through cobra-ridden jungles where tigers lurked and elephants lurched , and on into the cool , airy teakwood forests of the uplands . In ancient , serpent-topped temples , yellow-robed monks prepared a welcome . <P> As the Great God on My Head Phumiphon Adundet , * the Power Coming from the Strength of the Earth , at long last stepped ashore from the flagship Sri Ayuthia onto Siamese soil , every temple bell in the land rang out a greeting . <P> All Grinning . TIME Correspondent John Stanton cabled the following report of Phumiphon 's return : <P> " Bangkok 's newspapers appeared in odd-colored inks to mark the day-red , blue , green , and a raspberry known locally as impulsive red . Instead of news stories they carried long columns of verse . At 5 a.m. , a navy radio station began to broadcast the proceedings . It was a most discreet broadcast , failing to mention that when the King was transferring by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did a good-humored dance to the buffeting of the waves . <P> " As the Sri Ayuthia came up the Chao Phraya river , thousands of sampans rushed out to greet him , and radios blared recordings of Anchor 's Aweigh and the King 's own musical compositions . By noon of a blistering day , crowds jammed all Bangkok vantage points . At 3 p.m. a landing stage at the Memorial Bridge collapsed , pitching a hundred people into the water . Since all Siamese seem to be born swimmers , no one was drowned . Since all Siamese are born cheerful , all came up grinning . <P> " Along the broad King 's Walk , behind whose fashionable modern apartment buildings lurk some of its best-advertised houses of prostitution , Chinese merchants set up hobbyhorse displays and giant paintings of the King . Incense candles were made ready to be lighted and to waft pleasant smells ( very important in Siam ) when the King arrived . A youngster got tired of waiting , climbed up into a tree and went to sleep . Passers-by tickled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Police wormed their way through the crowd notifying property owners that a police order issued the day before had been a big mistake : contrary to the order , people were allowed to watch the procession from rooftops.
