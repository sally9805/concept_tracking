Members from 60 nations , the U.S. and Russia included , raised their hands in unanimous approval of a Brazilian resolution that 1 ) bars a U.N . debate on Korea for the time being , 2 ) gives U.N . negotiators at Panmunjom freedom to negotiate an armistice " consistent with United Nations principles and objectives . " Twenty-four hours before , Russia 's Andrei Vishinsky had been supporting a completely contrary resolution , a Polish catch-all that , in effect , would have reopened the Korean issue and brought it before the Assembly for debate . For 90 minutes he had sneered and snorted at the U.S. for " quibbling " and " stalling .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any matter involving the Korean war . The Assembly 's Political Committee was so awed by what happened that it pattered applause .
