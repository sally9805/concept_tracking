According to its publicity brochures , Victoria 's ivy-covered Empress Hotel is " stately , dignified , charming " and " suavely staffed . " Located in the heart of Canada 's most loyal citadel of British ways and manners , the hotel greets its well-mannered guests with a massive display of paneled walls , beamed ceilings and straight-backed chairs , serves them tea to the discreet accompaniment of a string ensemble . Small wonder , therefore , that an undersized , untweedy man wearing blue jeans , a grey fedora and a blue polka-dot handkerchief over the lower part of his face , was emphatically snubbed when he started to hold up the hotel 's coffeeshop at pistolpoint last week . <P> The little man entered the coffeeshop , crowded with delegates to the Pacific Logging Congress , and shouted , " This is a holdup ! " No one , least of all the suave staff , paid any attention . Then the bandit kicked over a chair and shouted again : " Do n't anyone move ! " A few people turned to look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was too much for the little man . Waving his pistol desperately in the air , he fired a single embarrassed shot into the ceiling . <P> It was crude , it was shocking bad form , but it did get results . The patrons swung around in their chairs , stared in stupefaction as the bandit ordered the cashier to fill a paper sack he threw toward her . Then , clutching the sack , containing $285 , he scuttled out the door . It was the first time in all its 47 years , the management announced , that the hotel had suffered the indignity of a robbery . Such a moment could not go unrecorded . The Vancouver Sun , which occasionally yields to the temptation to tweak Victoria 's stiff upper lip , assigned star Cartoonist Len Norris to the historical task ( see cut ) .
