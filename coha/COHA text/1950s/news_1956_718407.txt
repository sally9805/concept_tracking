txt The year-old united labor movement made its strongest political showing last month in states west of the Mississippi , where the greatest progress toward regional union mergers has been made . In the industrial east , where units of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations are still apart at the local level , the election results were far less heartening to union leaders . These indications that unity , did pay off at the polls have given labor 's high command confidence that future campaigns I will see a marked increase in the political effectiveness of the combined organization . Top unionists feel especially hopeful on this score because , by the tine the next national election rolls around in 1958 , all state and city union councils will have been forced to get togetlier under the requirements of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. constitution . Strength Undetermined ? Despite this optimism , the first post-merger political test ; has failed to provide a clear answer to the old question of how influential unions are in deter , mining the voting pattern of their rank-and-file . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colorado and eastern Pennsylvania ? evidence was strong that intensive union activity had been crucial in carrying Democrats to victory against the Eisenhower tide . But in most other places it was hard to establish any direct connection between what unions did and hew the balloting turned out . The united movement won in only nine of the thirty-six Congressional districts it marked for special effort . And union members in large numbers disContinued regarded its ' advice to vote for Adlai E. Stevenson . Even when it cams to getting out the vote , a principal focus of labor 's effort , the results were spotty . For the country as a whole , the proportion of eligible voters who bothered to exercise their franchise dipped from 62.7 per cent gin 1952 to 58.6 per cent this year . In only a few areas did unions have conspicuous success in pulling up this record for members of union families . In this city a joint labor effort tripled registration among Puerto Rican Workers . In Pueblo , Colo. ' union political directors refused to take the members ' word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote . A check of registration records showed only 34 per cent actually on the rolls . A systematic follow-up induced neost of the laggards to register . In the face of pre-merger warnings by many Republican and industry leaders that unity would lead to . the accumulation of massive " political slush funds , " preliminary reports indicate that unions spent less in this election than they did four years ago . The Committee on Political Education , political arm . of the A. F. L.-C . I. 0. , reported that it had taken in $520,591 in contributions from union members up to Oct. 31 . In the same period it got an additional $271,855 in educational funds from union treasuries. $300,000 Drop in Spending When the books for the year are closed , the combined total is expected to grow by about $100,000 . In 1952 the old A. F. L. Labor 's League for Political Education reported spending $485 , - 081 . The C. I. 0 . Political Action Committee used $415,041 in individual contributions and $339,991 in educational funds . On this basis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - 000 short of the Sum expended by its forerunners ? four years ago . Fear that the differing political traditions of the A. F. L. and C. I. 0 . would make it painful to combine operations at the headquarters level was dissipated early in the merger . Jack Kroll , director of the old C. I. 0 . committee , and James L. , his A. F. L. counterpart , were named co-directors of the pooled group . They functioned cooperatively from the start . Mr. Kroll , who is 71. years old , deleted 39 lines one of the federation 's legislative representatives , is popular in labor and on Capitol Hill . Economic Shift Seen One of the most tantalizing hypotheses to emerge from the initial analysis of the national voting results by A. F , L.-C . I. 0 . experts is that a shift has occurred in the economic dividing line between Democrats and Republicans . In the past , union voting specialists proceeded on the theory that most persons with an annual income below $6,000 or $7 , - 000 were Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preliminary appraisal prepared by the political committee 's research staff suggests that the dividing line this year Was in the $3,500 to $4,500 income range . Most union members now earn at least that much a year . The committee analysts came up with certain other basic observations and conclusions about the election . One was that the only dependable political organizations left in the country were those based on effective union political action . Detroit , Philadelphia and St. Louis were cited as examples . In emphasizing the political benefits of unity , the committee noted that fourteen of the nineteen states in which labor mergers had been completed were among the twenty-two Western derground sources on conditions states . behind the Iron Curtain . Indicative was the situation Mr. - Reuther and his erstwhile in Colorado , where John A. Carroll rolled up his winning margin for the Senate in five counties that were predominantly industrial and mining . In Michigan , support given to the Republicans by James R. Hoffa of the teamsters and his faction in the State Federation of Labor failed to keep Walter P. Reuther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election score . In other industrial states division proved more costly . The moral that most union chiefs drew from the balloting was that political action would have to become a year-round activity with full-time staffs at the state and local level . However , the more candid acknowledge that real headway is virtually impossible in some areas because the local union leaders themselves have grown too selfsatisfied and too distant from the rank-and-file . In scores of lenion offices in the last election , campaign buttons and pamphlets piled up in corners and remained undistributed . One ranking unionist complained that many of his colleagues were unwilling to get their members involved in poliI tics for fear such activity might lead them to take a more direct interest in- the affairs of their own union . Minimum Pay Fight Set On the legislative front , the merged federation is likely to put its peak stress next year on Congressional action to extend the protection of the Federal run a forceful drive for the election of Congressional and state candidates in a Presidential year if they ignored the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Democrats ' ability to hold Congress despite the monumental dimensions of the Eisenhower sweep . As proof that an opposite tactic would have been less fruitful , they point to the defeat of Democratic candidates in West Virginia and Kentucky . John L. Lewis , independent United Mine Workers is especially strong in these coal states . Mr. Lewis decided he could exert more influence in the Senate contests there by " de-emphasizing " the Presidency . Accordingly , his union took no stand on who should occupy the White House . Republicans scored surprise wins in the three Senate fights in the two states . Global Policy Disputed International affairs are proving as troublesome a topic for the merged movement as they are for the State Department . It is in this area that the leaders of the former A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . are finding it hardest to submerge their personal and policy differences . One reason that world problems have become so dominant in a movement historically concerned with bread-and-butter matters is the intensity of Mr. Meany 's involvement in the inteenational situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the isolationist environment of the building trades , Mr. Meany now is convinced that nothing unions do on the domestic front will mean much if Soviet imperialism goes unchecked . Essentially , there is no difference between the two factions on the importance of stopping communism . But they do not see eye to eye on how to go about it . Mr. Meany puts more emphasis than some of - his colleagues on military resistance and on denunciation of " neutralist " tendencies . They are more inclined than he to believe that peace can be made secure by extending economic aid to underdeve/oped countries and by cultural interchanges . Mr. Meany is impatient with the secretariat of the International . Confederation of Free Tradee Union for red tape and indecision in tackling the Communist problem . He resists pressure from the C. I. 0 . group to abandon the American federation 's independent activities in the foreign field and put all its trust in the world body . The situation is complicated by staff hostilities . Mr. Meany 's closest adviser on foreign affairs is Jay Lovestone , secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former general secretary of the Communist party in this country , but now dedicated to the party 's extermination , Mr. Lovestone has built up a world-wide network of unassociates in the C. I. 0 . have little love for Mr. Lovestone . They feel his group should be subordinate to the federation 's international affairs committee and that Mr. Meany should lean less heavily on him for guidance. , The issue is scheduled for a showdown this swum &; Jacob S. Potofsky of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers resigned early in October as cochairman of ? the international committee , Mr. Meany , the other co-chairman , has offered the vacant post to Mr. Reuther . Mr. Reuther , a ? unionist of ambition , ability and imagination , who stepped aside as president of the C. I. 0 . to let Mr. ' Meany head the combined group , has surprised some of his closest friends by the pains he has taken to avoid any suggestion that he is trying to usurp the functions of the top man . Mr. Meany , whose flair is not , for diplomacy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting than is his wont if Mr. Reuther becomes his cochairman on foreign affairs . Unite in Crises Perhaps the factor that will do most to iron out the discord ' within the federation leadership is the worsening of the world outlook . When the danger to the Free World is most apparent , the A. F. L. and C. I. 0 . factions find it relatively easy to agree on a program , as , they did Friday . The same spirit was evident in the response to the federation 's appeal for union contributions to provide relief for Hungarian workers . At first some unions held back because of uncertainty over who was to spend the money , but once itbecame plain that the appeal was part of a united effort by all democratic labor groups ' to aid the Hungarian-victims , more than $150,000 poured in . It is demonstrations like this that make most of the leaders of the merged group certain that it will go on to a steadily expanding horizon of usefulness to its members , to the country and to the world . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of the united labor movement .
