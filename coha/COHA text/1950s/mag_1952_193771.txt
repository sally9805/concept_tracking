Last Sunday night , driving back from Scranton , Pa. , it was my bad luck to be caught in a crawling , honking , bumper-to-bumper traffic snarl , and I was reminded again of one of the most famous stories ever published in TIME . <P> At a time when more Americans than ever before are taking to the nation 's highways , I am sure you will enjoy re-reading Writer Paul O'Neil 's wonderful account of " The Last Traffic Jam " ( TIME , Dec. 15 , 1947 ) : <P> In his long and losing war with machines , modern man has devoted almost as much energy to damning newfangled contraptions as he has to inventing them . He has cursed the power loom , the steam locomotive , the Welsbach mantle , the airplane and the electric shaver with a vehemence calculated to deliver whole generations of mankind to the greasiest fry cooks of nether Hell . <P> But in half a century of blissful selfdelusion , he has failed to perceive that the family automobile is the most monstrous engine of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the automobile kills him , maims him , embroils him with the law and provides mobile shelter for rakes intent on seducing his daughters . He takes it into his garage as fondly as an Arab leading a prize mare into his tent . He woos it with Simoniz , Prestone , Ethyl and rich lubricants - and goes broke trading it in on something flashier an hour after he has made the last payment on the old one . . . <P> In some big cities , vast traffic jams never really got untangled from dawn to midnight ; the bray of horns , the stink of exhaust fumes , and the crunch of crumpling metal eddied up from them as insistently as the vaporous roar of Niagara . Psychiatrists , peering into these lurching , honking , metallic herds , discovered all sorts of aberrations in the clutch-happy humans behind the steering wheels . <P> Some fell prey to a great , dull hopelessness . In Manhattan , where it often takes 15 minutes to go a block through trucks , cabs and darting pushcarts , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got expressions just like people in Europe . It used to be you could get into a fight , but now even truck drivers take the attitude : ' If you wan na hit me , hit me . ' They do n't even get out to look at a fender . " But more often , people experienced a wild sense of frustration . Said Dr. J. P. Hilton , a Denver psychiatrist : " The driver behind a traffic crawler gets angry . His reason departs . He wants to ram through , to pass , to punish the object of his anger . " Did the doctor feel the same way ? " And how , " he said , and shuddered . " I dream of wide highways and no automobiles - no automobiles at all . " But though postwar motorists were gradually becoming horn-blowing neurotics with tendencies toward drinking , cat-kicking and wife-beating , there were few who did not believe that the traffic evil would soon be corrected . This enormous delusion has been a part of U.S. folklore since the day of the linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
