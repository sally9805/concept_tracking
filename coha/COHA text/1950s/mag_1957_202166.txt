Artist Boris Artzybasheff has a cool , ex-machine gunner 's eye that can ruffle even the armor of a battleship , and has . With a knack for spotting an ogle where an I-beam ought to be , Artzy has been doing covers for TIME since 1941 , created a pistol-packing battleship as background for Japanese Admiral Nagano , a school of sea-monster telescopes for Admiral Doenitz , a Veto-Bug for Gromyko . A special euphoria overtakes Artzy when the humans depart , leaving the machines alone with their fears , grimaces , ulcers and unique sex-appeal . Among Artzy 's memorable anthropomorphic revelations : his three-armed Pentagon ( July 2 , 1951 ) , a camera-faced Amateur Photographer ( Nov. 2 , 1953 ) , his Mark III Computer ( Jan. 23 , 1950 ) , which now hangs at Harvard , and his 6-29 Radar Set , now owned by M.I.T. After turning in his current cover ( his 166th to be published ) , TIME editors asked Artzy to play turnabout , portray a mechanized version of Artzybasheff ( see above ) .

To hold back the crowds , the exhibit had to be closed briefly every few hours-while the Russian exhibit went begging .

" They do not do all of these things all the time , but in 50 years of shooting for those mixed objectives , they have made the U.P . the world 's second-largest and most enterprising wire-news merchant , and the shirtsleeve college for thousands of U.S. newsmen .
