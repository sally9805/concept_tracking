The " brainwave machine " ( electroencephalograph , to doctors ) is now used mainly after people get seriously ill and doctors have to find out what 's wrong . Two Cleveland neurologists report that the machine can do better than that : it can spot some kinds of crackups before outward physical signs occur ( by noting abnormal patterns of brain-wave pulsation ) . Their recommendation : use the machine widely on railroad engineers , airplane pilots and bus drivers , and on business executives responsible for " vast undertakings . "
