Last week the House of Representatives defeated the bill for Hawaiian-Alaskan statehood after a loud-voiced , low-swinging debate . Loudest and lowest was New York 's Republican Representative John Pillion , who discovered that anti-Communism can be used to justify almost any political action . <P> As he spoke from the well of the House , Pillion stood beside a huge bulletin board thumbtacked with clippings about Hawaii 's Communists . Pointing at the clippings with an accusing finger , Pillion cried : " The last session of the Hawaiian legislature was a Communist holiday . " <P> The statehood bill , said he , guarantees " Harry Bridges fwo seats in the Senate and two in the House . . . Statehood at this time would only serve to deliver the Hawaiian state government to the Communist Party on a silver platter . " <P> Pillion has never been to Hawaii-and does not intend to go . He recently explained to the House Rules Committee that he fears Hawaiian hospitality would make him change his mind about statehood . But he nonetheless considers himself something of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week : <P> " I 've never been to Russia either ; yet I know they are a Communist country . " <P> Influence Imported . Hawaii had a few defenders . Illinois ' Republican Representative Harold Velde , who has never been accused of being a Communist sympathizer , said that the Communist influence in Hawaii stems from California , and added : " The state of Hawaii would be better able and more inclined to fight the influence of Communism as a state than as a territory . " Nebraska 's Republican A. L. Miller pointed out that a 1951 FBI report listed only 36 known Communists in Hawaii ( as opposed to more than 20,000 in John Pillion 's home state ) and that seven of the Hawaii Reds have since been convicted . <P> Although much of the noise was about Communism in Hawaii , there were more basic factors working against the bill . <P> Southern Congressmen ( including Speaker Sam Rayburn ) , fearing the two new states would dilute their anti-civil rights voting bloc , were strongly against the measure . <P> Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that one of the House seats to be given Alaska and Hawaii would be from their state , which barely qualified for its present number of seats under the last population apportionment . Said Massachusetts Republican Donald Nicholson : " We will elect somebody in Hawaii or Alaska to represent my state . " Chimed in South Carolina 's W.J.B. ( for William Jennings Bryan ) Dorn : " Is it not true that if our friend from Massachusetts were to lose his seat ... he will lose it to a man whom we have deported ? " <P> Dorn presumably had in mind Harry Bridges ( still undeported ) . <P> Steam Gone . The House voted 218 to 170 to send the statehood bill back to committee-and thereby kill it for at least this year . Democrats split almost evenly : <P> 105 were for recommittal , 107 against .
