Red General Giap last week concentrated eight regular Viet Minh divisions against the 300-mile edge of the Red River Delta . The French , anxiously awaiting reinforcements from Europe and North Africa , still believed they could hold . The position on the eve of the Delta battle : Communists : Giap has deployed two infantry divisions and one heavy-weapons division against the Delta 's northern rim ; he has two divisions ready in the south . <P> Giap has also infiltrated the Delta with the equivalent of three more divisions . <P> Best estimate of the Communist strength : 110,000 regulars , up to 200,000 irregulars . <P> French : General Rene Cogny has a smaller force-27% French Union ( mostly North Africans and Foreign Legionnaires ) , the rest Vietnamese-but he still possesses superiority in heavy weapons , plus an unopposed air force operating almost on top of its bases . Cogny has regrouped one-third of his army into nine mobile groups , three smaller armored task forces , and a paratroop reserve ; but most of his Vietnamese are tied down behind fixed defenses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile , and may concentrate against any single point ; the French must rely upon the heavy counterpunch . <P> 2 ) Communist morale is high ; French morale is shaken ; Vietnamese morale is low . 3 ) The Communists already hold two-thirds of the Delta by day , almost all of it by night ; the Delta population-except in the cities , with their anti-Communist refugees-is considered either pro-Communist or neutral . <P> Under normal conditions , Cogny could not long hold out without substantial reinforcement . The French are still counting on the weather . IndoChina 's heavy rains will commence around July i. the Delta will flood , and both sides will have to stick to the roads or contend with a shoulder-high quagmire . <P> Cogny is regrouping behind an intricate series of rivers and canals , a loosely connected perimeter 100 miles shorter and more easily defensible than his present one ; he intends to let the Vietnamese army prove itself by defending the outer zones . Cogny believes he can hold until the dry season and the fall-when he must have certain reinforcements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of Asian war : " Never fight unless victory is certain " ; he must also synchronize with Peking and Geneva . But Giap has perhaps three clear weeks , and apprehensive French eyes are already turning towards a rubble-dust town called Phuly , 40 miles south of Hanoi , and the most vulnerable spot in the Delta . Giap has already eroded eleven of Phuly 's twelve outlying defense posts ; he has the twelfth under harassment ; and from now on , his possibilities are a succession of dangerous " ifs . " If Giap attacks Phuly , if he gets it , if Vietnamese and Western morale further crumbles , he might decide to try a big pincer offensive from south and north , designed to cut in between Hanoi and the sea . If Giap can do this , Cogny will have to evacuate Hanoi . These are " ifs " indeed ; but though the French still keep up an optimistic front , U.S. military observers on the scene are already talking about " whens .
