SELLING &; MARKETING <P> To end the " price pack " which pads the cost of new cars with phony charges , the auto industry last week got some help from the Senate Commerce Committee . It voted to require manufacturers to stick a " suggested " retail price on each car delivered . Sponsored by Senators " Mike " Monroney and Strom Thurmond , the bill also requires automakers to list suggested prices for optional equipment and accessories , calls for fines of $1,000 on each untagged car , $1,000 for each misleading label . The bill , backed by Ford and General Motors , must now clear the full Senate and the House before it can go to the President .
