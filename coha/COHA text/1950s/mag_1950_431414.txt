We two together ? all others shut out . That 's what marriage is in its essence . An island of intimacy , full of shared joys and sorrows , private jokes , code words , quick recognitions and responses , unfailing sympathy and understanding ? a secret world , with a population of two and a language , a landscape , and a climate all its own . But , unfortunately , even in the best marriages the climate sometimes grows very chilly , the inhabitants are suddenly strangers , and the view offers more problems than pleasures . It 's not surprising , really . Two people could n't possibly work out a life comfortable for both of them without having moments of irritation and impatience , without suffering vexations and disappointments , without making changes and compromises . You need a background of at least ten years of happy marriage before you can laugh at the story of the couple who , on their Golden Wedding Anniversary , were interviewed by a reporter . " And tell me. " he asked , pencil poised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider divorce ? " " Oh , no , not divorce , " the little old lady said . " but sometimes " ? she paused and winked at her husband ? " murder ! " For some women , the solution for any difficulty in their marriage is a quiet retreat to an aloof oneness encased in stony silence . Others do just the opposite . They share their dissatisfactions with an audience ? the larger , the better ? of relatives , friends , neighbors , acquaintances , and sometimes the total stranger occupying the next seat in the bus . Men , let 's admit it , seldom do either of these things . They seem to remember what we too often forget : Marriage is for two , for two alone , for no more and no less , and its problems are best solved by talking them over together , " just between us . " Old-fashioned marriages must have been very silent ones . If we can believe novels , diaries , and other accounts of the last century , a great many , women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas to themselves and confined their conversation to agreeable trivialities . Men , perhaps just because of this , were apparently equally reticent about discussing with them the things that really mattered . We can all remember women of our grandmothers ' era ( and later ) who , as wives , boasted prettily , " My husband does n't want me to bother about money . He never tells me a thing about his business . " The result was that , as widows , they frequently took in washing to support their children .  | ( Continued from page 68 ) Modern marriages are , or should be , articulate . We all realize the therapy of " talking it over , " but we 'd probably bent by doing it more often and more thoughtfully . It needs a time and a place . You ca n't discuss your hopes and plans and dreams d desires in a spare ten minutes before expected guests arrive . You ca n't plan a udget and work out a financial program while you 're out walking , a mile from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We think it a duty to say " You need a haircut " or You left the light on in the garage again " without accepting an equal oblition to mention " You made a wonderful job of carving the chicken " and That 's a beautiful tie you bought today . " It needs good temper and good humor and good timing . All too often we let a minor irritation grow in our righteous lence until it reaches criminal proportioans . Then in a tone and manner implying " Stop committing arson , forgery , and rmed robbery , " we demand " Stop leaving your shoes in the bathroom . " Talking it over means listening , too . Listening with ears , eyes , heart , and imagination , so we may learn to know and understand each other . One of the greatest joys in marriage comes from this ? the moment when a word , a gesture , a bar of music , makes you look up and across a crowded room catch your husband 's glance seeking you .
