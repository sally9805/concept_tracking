Kansas City 's Employers Reinsurance Co. last week had some gloomy news for its stockholders . In the first six months of 1951 the company lost $2,687,519 . Main reason : skyrocketing claims for auto accidents . All over the U.S. , casualty insurance companies are feeling the same pinch . In New York , where the bulk of nationwide auto liability insurance is written , casualty insurance companies went $120 million into the red on auto policies between 1946 and 1950 . Their deficits last year totaled $11 million , in 1951 's first half were still growing . <P> Casualty men complain that inflation-minded juries are handing out purse-popping awards in accident cases . Accidents are growing because there are more cars on the road , and too many motorists are driving too fast and too carelessly . The cost of car repairs has also shot up , and new cars are more difficult to fix than pre-war models . For example , to replace a front fender on a 1940 Chevrolet cost $18.80 for parts and labor ten years ago ; the same job on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spite of six rate increases in the last seven years , casualty companies are already getting ready to holler for more .
