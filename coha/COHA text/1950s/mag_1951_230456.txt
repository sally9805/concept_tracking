A decade ago , only five U.S. corporate giants boasted sales of more than $1 billion a year . Last week , with most annual reports for 1950 now tabulated , the number in industry 's " billion-dollar league " had risen to a total of nineteen companies ( see box ) . * <P> In sales as well as profits , General Motors was tops . And with a big slice of G.M. income to fatten its earnings , Du Pont , though it ranked only 13th in sales , stood fourth in profits . Contrariwise , some companies with big sales ranked relatively poorly in profits , because of traditionally slim profit margins . A notable example : A &; P ( which has not yet finished auditing its fiscal 1950 sales , but expects a tidy increase ) ranks fifth in sales but only 16th in profits . <P> If any confirmation of industry 's growth was needed , FTC and SEC provided it last week . They estimated the 1950 profits of all U.S. manufacturing companies at an alltime record of $23.2 billion before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger corporate income taxes left a total net of $12.9 billion , a 43% gain . Moreover , the biggest gains were made by the smallest companies : a 106% average increase for those with assets under $250,000 , v. a 31% rise for those above $100 million . But both big and little had to set aside such huge sums for plant expansion , rising inventory costs , etc. , that stockholders got only about 40% of profits ( $5.6 billion ) in dividends . However , stockholders are faring better this year : all dividend payments for 1951 's first quarter are 13% higher than in 1950 . <P> <P> * Privately owned Ford Motor Co. , which does not report its sales publicly , is undoubtedly another .
