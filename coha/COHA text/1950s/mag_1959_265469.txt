Since Oldtime Songwriter Hughie Cannon wrote the lyrics in 1902 , singers have been pleading in every form of jazz from ragtime to bop : " Wo n't you come home , Bill Bailey , wo n't you come home ? Bill <P> Bailey , wo n't you please come home ? " These days , any enterprising traveler in the Far East can hear the answer-a firm no-from Bill Bailey himself . <P> Well , almost himself . Billy Bailey is 73 and runs Singapore 's Coconut Grove , an obscure and homey bar ( no unescorted women allowed ) next door to a Buddhist nunnery on Singapore 's Cuppage Road . A guitar keeps the air moving . The drinks are on the level , and the talk is good , since Iowa-born , ex-Vaudevillian Bailey does most of it . <P> Circus Minimus . Bill 's clients , mainly young English , Australian and American couples , listen while he reminisces about how he introduced the late Sultan of Johore to the sweet mysteries of bourbon whisky , nod politely when Bill pontificates about modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that jazz , he says , are " just a rehash of the old stuff , what used to be the Texas Tommy , the Bunny Hug and the Grizzly Bear . " <P> Bill Bailey ought to know . Born in 1886 , the son of a patent-medicine hawker , he learned song-and-dance routines to help sell the family product : Bailey 's Gypsy Liniment . At 120-proof , the stuff worked like magic . Later , in vaudeville , Bill hoofed up with a singer named Dave Hodges , who changed his name to Barnum so the pair could work their way around the country as Bailey &; Barnum . They were a sort of circus minimus until a Manhattan impresario gave them a five-minute spot in Fred and Adele Astaire 's Lady , Be Good . The playbill did not mention their act , Bailey says airily , but " it stopped the show . I remember the pit musicians claiming overtime . " <P> From the circuits and the speakeasies , Bailey &; Barnum began picking up about $900 a week . But as Bill tells it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him one way and talkies the other , so he broke up the old act and left the country . With his wife , he drifted east via South Africa and Australia , did routines in Peking , Tsingtao , Manila , Java and Shanghai . Then he put in two weeks at Singapore 's famed Raffles Hotel , looked over the city and decided : " This is the place for me . " <P> The Baileys lost all their money in 1939 producing a show that used Hollywood cheesecake to whet the Eastern appetite , quickly suffered an Occidental death . Interned by the Japanese during World War II , Bill , then in his mid-50s , put the years of imprisonment to good use : he learned to read and write , something he had never found time to accomplish before . <P> Like Old Black Joe . When the British liberated Singapore in 1945 , the Baileys wandered out of prison and into town , found a house marked ENEMY PROPERTY . Bill added a note of his own- " Occupied by Bill Bailey " - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , soon turned it into the Coconut Grove . Old Trouper Bailey had come home at last .
