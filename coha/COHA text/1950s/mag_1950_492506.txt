EL PASO , out where two of the continent 's major trade routes intersect in the mountains , is a caravansary city which grew up to the tune of guns and guitars . Here two wholly different peoples , separated only by the Rio Grande 's sepia line , have sought to accommodate themselves to a piece of hard , dry earth , rich in fangs , thorns , buried treasure and strategic , even if sometimes menacing , topography . Pressed together by the very sides of the mountains and fused beneath the oven of the sky , El Paso on the north side of the river and the Mexican city of Juarez on the south have so long been married by propinquity that , despite their occasional high-tempered spats , either would be grievously bereft and monumentally lonely without the other . Today , 60 per cent of El Paso 's 135,000 population is of Mexican descent . In fact , so pleasing do the 75,000 citizens of Juarez find many El Paso fashions , manners , music , dance patterns , language , money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press for their departure from the old Mexican verities . But if Juarez may be accused of " going gringo , " it can as truthfully be said that El Paso is probably the only spot on earth that could be called " nominally Texas . " Only in a minor way does this result from the fact that Mexico , due to changes in the Rio Grande 's course , owns 300 acres of downtown El Paso , known as Cordova Island , and has a plausible and unrelinquished claim on 600 acres more  --  the Chamizal Zone , which contains , among other useful items , the El Paso County Courthouse . The thing that dilutes El Paso 's Texasism is a feeling of being ignored by the rest of the state . Its citizens often remark , " They do n't give a damn about us down in Austin " ? and the inference is : " That works both ways . " You see , El Paso lies approximately 600 miles west of Austin , the capital of Texas , where the influence of the relatively nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston is much more readily felt in the halls of government . In its homely daily doings , El Paso has about as much in common with Beaumont , Texas , which languishes in the coastal loblollies more than 800 miles away , as Denver has with New Orleans . For example , in high , dry El Paso , parts of which are more than 4000 feet above sea level , the family wash dries in less than half an hour after being hoisted on the line . In Beaumont , it hangs out for three days and then mildews . Adobe  --  sun-baked blocks of mud PHOTOGRAPHY BY GENE LESTER and straw which stand for centuries when fashioned into El Paso buildings  --  would melt in a month in moisture-blessed Houston . Indeed , these two cities , each figuratively a capital of one of the federated realms of which Texas is composed , live in such divergent conditions that a manufacturer of prepared cake mix must employ a different formula and set of cooking directions for each of them . Besides , most of El Paso 's potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Mexico and Arizona . And , since the great Elephant Butte dam across the Rio Grande lies upstream from the city in New Mexico , that state is in a position , at least geographically , to cut old El Paso 's water off . Should that happen , El Paso County would dry up and , along with the tumbling tumbleweeds , blow away . El Pasoans ' feeling of closer identification with their non-Texan neighbors is indicated by their habit of referring to the regions to the east as " back in Texas . " That passing phrase mirrors many El Pasoans ' belief that they are somehow more self-reliant and in possession of more of the pioneer virtues of ruggedness and straightforwardness than the tender-footed inhabitants of other American regions . As a case in point , they mention the big sight-unseen cow deals that go on in the lobby of the Paso Del Norte Hotel , where whole herds change hands on a basis of the seller 's oral description and without the buyer ever leaving his comfortable chair to inspect the cattle he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Paso claims for her domain $150,000,000 worth , are one of El Paso 's prime assets , just as , in years when the price is favorable , the area 's cotton crop amounts to $60 , - 000,000 and its copper yield to $70,000,000 . Of the fourth of El Paso 's vaunted " C 's " ? cattle , cotton , copper and climate  --  more later on . But the best money that comes into El Paso , in that it is reasonably depression-proof , arrives in the form of the monthly millions paid to the 40,000 military people in El Paso 's general vicinity . And when you stop to realize that El Paso is the most remote from competitors of any city in the land , it follows that a whopping hunk of soldiers ' pay finds its way into the local cash registers . More than that , El Paso , like San Antonio and Washington , D. C. , is the sort of town where old soldiers like to retire on their pensions and among their kind . In much the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paso is a division point for the Santa Fe and the Texas and Pacific , and a kind of territorial capital for the Southern ( Continued on Page 57 ) great Santa Rita open-pit mine at Silver City , New Mexico , American Smelting and Refining draws much of its raw material from , of all places , South Africa . Once this South African ore is mined , it is reduced to concentrates before being shipped . These concentrates are then " rented " to United States-bound ships to serve as ballast . After they reach Houston or New Orleans , they are borne overland by rail to El Paso . The refined copper then completes its journey around Robin Hood 's barn to the Northern and Eastern fabricators by rail . When it leaves El Paso , it will pass , if the time be early summer , through miles of cotton fields blooming pink and white and yellow . Here , where irrigation water is at a premium and labor is relatively plentiful , the modest demands of cotton on the former and its huge demands on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine , make this an ideal locality for its culture . These irrigated cotton lands are said to produce the remarkable sum of $270 worth of premium long-staple cotton and seed by-products per average acre . And in either cotton-chopping or cotton-picking time , when there are great pools of the idle and hungry in Mexico , and when good jobs beckon so close at hand , substantial population shifts take place in the middle of the night , as the Mexicans cross the shallow river in hordes , despite all efforts of the busy but outnumbered immigration officials as they patrol the riverbank in jeeps , with sawed-off shotguns and rifles . Since the demands of cotton for cheap labor do not stop once it 's been ginned , a small portion of the valley 's crop is spun and woven right in El Paso , where the finjshed denims are subsequently cut and sewed into the copper-riveted cowboy breeches that shine the saddles of the West . Many of those saddles , however , back in pre-World War I days , were not cowboy saddles at all , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In those days El Paso was the cavalry capital of the nation , and Fort Bliss polo teams were the toast of the town . Nowadays the cavalry saber has given way at Fort Bliss to antiaircraft batteries , just as aerial weapons predominate at Biggs Air Force Base , and at the nearby White Sands Proving Ground , in New Mexico , where guided missiles are being studied and tested . El Pasoans became acutely aware of these guided-missile experiments recently when one big rocket abandoned its intended course and began zizzing over town . Then , after exploring the upper regions above Juarez , it smashed harmlessly but noisily into an unoccupied piece of Chihuahua . While Fort Bliss is today the nation 's largest Army post , in terms of the sheer size of its training and maneuver areas , one of El Paso 's most engaging show places is the exact replica of the small original fort . Yet the frontier troops who manned that original fort appeared on the scene some three centuries after Cabeza de Vaca . Having been shipwrecked on the shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost naked , all the way across Texas and , according to the belief of the best historical detectives , arrived at the pass in 1536 . But not until 1827 , when Juan Maria Ponce de Lain built a hacienda , or ranch house , there , did anything much happen north of the river on El Paso 's present site . This was all to the good , since , when Texas revolted from Mexico in the middle ' 30 's , there was no Anglo-Saxon population whatever here . Consequently , there was no bloodletting , nor the resultant recriminations that would have marred the city 's founding with trans-Rio Grande hatreds . Then in the late 1840 's , James Wiley Magoffin , a Kentuckian who 'd come rolling down the Santa Fe Trail , set up a trading post here , and settlers , encouraged by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , in ' 48 , which pronounced the north Side of the river American while the south side remained Mexican , began to move in and cluster around Magoffin 's trading post . In 1849 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both by the activation of Fort Bliss and the . constant procession of gold hunters going through town on their way to California . Soon the Butterfield Overland Mail , longest in the world , began running its leather-slung coaches from St. Louis to San Francisco via El Paso , which by now was a collection of settlements called Magoffinsville , Hart 's Mill and Franklin . Getting into the swing of the tourist business then and there , El Paso , in 1859 , consisted of two stage stations , a hotel , a few stores and a whole constellation of saloons . One of the most popular items served by these saloons was a local product from irrigated vineyards planted by the Franciscan priests . " Paso brandy " had become well known for thousands of miles around . During the 1860 's , El Paso passed the time with straightaway horse races , cockfights , faro , monte , poker and impromptu duels . Citizen W. W. Mills recorded in his memoirs that most of those interred in El Paso 's cemeteries had deputed this life fully shod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority of his fellows , his marching orders were posted on the " Notice Tree " in the Plaza . But living in these parts was so extravagantly tough that in the bleak years of the ' 70 's the Anglo-Saxon population began to dwindle away . At the time of its incorporation in 1873 , El Paso contained only twenty-three Anglo-Americans and 150 Mexicans . Then a kind of four-tined , forked lightning struck in 1880 . It was the onrush of railroads racing toward the strategic pass . The Southern Pacific pulled in from the West in the late spring of ' 81 , followed a month later by the Santa Fe . The Mexican Central Railroad was already abuilding southward from El Paso toward Mexico City . Then in 1882 the Texas and Pacific blew in from the East . El Paso 's Anglo-Saxon population bulged with fast-arriving thousands . Among these newcomers was an almost unbelievably heavy percentage of gamblers , fancy gals , thieves , murderers , crooked lawyers and assorted human vermin . Law enforcement , when anybody could be found to tackle this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which malefactors could elude punishment simply by crossing the Rio Grande , " a mile wide and a foot deep , too thin to plow and too thick to drink . " And many years were to pass before even the most diligent and heroic efforts were to bring law , order and a reasonable facsimile of civilization to El Paso . As far back as 1865 , El Paso del Norte had begun to be appreciated as a good place from which to engineer revolutions . It was in this year that Benito Juarez established his revolutionary government in the city that was later to bear his name . From this point " The Great Liberator " conducted Mexico 's fight against the French army and the Hapsburg usurper , Maximilian , until Maximilian was killed and Juarez 's welcome as president of Mexico was assured . In 1911 Francisco Madero 's followers , including one of Garibaldi 's grandsons , captured the town of Juarez in a battle which eager El Pasoans had impatiently awaited and on which they had long since laid bets . When the shooting started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to El Paso 's historian , Owen P. White , had a simply marvelous time . But the revolutionist who was going to give El Paso the most heart throbs was Pancho Villa , the mountain bandit . In 1913 , with an army of rabble whose marching song was La Cucaracha , he attacked and captured Juarez , from which he ruled Northern Mexico , opcrating railroads , collecting customs duties and levying backbreaking taxes . Before long he developed a genuine liking for kidnaping United States citizens and raping their business enterprises in Mexico . When , however , he tried to spread his authority to Southern Mexico , he was defeated by Carranza 's forces and chased back to his northern bailiwick , where , among other things , he branched out into the United States by raiding the New Mexican town of Columbus . Soon El Paso , from which war correspondents had long been date-lining their dispatches , found itself flooded by some 40,000 National Guardsmen . But the United States Army , even under Black Jack Pershing and assisted at the time by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just was n't fast enough on its feet to catch Villa , who knew the paths through every thicket in Chihuahua . Some historians hold that , for diplomatic reasons , Pershing 's orders were not to capture Villa , but simply to keep him herded south of the Rio Grande . In any case , with the United States entry into the war against Germany , Villa was largely forgotten even in El Paso . Imagine El Paso 's surprise when , as late as 1919 , it heard a battle going on across the river and learned that Villa had once more captured Juarez . But this time the artillery and cavalry of the United States troops and the rifles and machetes of the Carranzistas were too much for Pancho . In fleeing , he lost face with his followers , and retired to his ranch , where he lived in relative quiet until , in 1923 , he was ambushed and killed in the outskirts of the city of Parral . Although Mexican bandits have never had a chance of taking over EI Paso , the nonmilitary infiltration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who enter illegally by wading the river at night , continues . And since these people are often the destitute peons from Mexico 's backward agricultural areas , not the least of the problems they create when they are packed into El Paso 's slums is a serious menace to the community 's health and sanitation . In these slums as many as sixty families  --  and Mexican families are not small  --  live in a single building supplied with one water faucet and two toilets . Nobody in El Paso , with the possible exception of the fellow who gets the rent , likes that . The city has already obliterated a noticeable amount of its slum area . This was done by routing Paisano Drive , the new express highway which permits rapid motor transit to the Upper or Lower Valley , straight through the heart of the slums . El Paso has two substantial units of slum-replacing Federal low-cost housing , which all hands agree has been a success from every standpoint . And at the moment , El Paso 's mayor and civic leaders are zealously exploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Paso 's slums and interrelated public-health problems closely resemble those of San Antonio . El Paso is the only city in the nation with a higher death rate from infant diarrhea than San Antonio . This disease results from filth disseminated by El Paso 's houseflies , which have long since become immune to DDT . However , El Paso has licked the typhus threat by stern ratproofing ordinances that are just as sternly enforced . Actually El Paso is going through a kind of municipal renaissance . It began , after a long period of civic lethargy , with something of a bang during ( Cont ed on Page 60 ) ( Continued from Page 58 ) the administration of El Paso 's previous mayor , an able , energetic young businessman named Dan Ponder , and still retains considerable momentum . Oddly enough  --  and perhaps it wo n't seem odd at all if you ever lived in a desert city ? many El Pasoans believe that it was Ponder 's refusal to grant the customary 20 per cent summer-waterrate discount that  --  along with his lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election . He had acted , however , on the advice of the water board , which knew precisely how critical El Paso 's water situation really was , and is . When Elephant Butte was being built in 1916 , El Paso , then about half its present size and sitting squarely on top of a large underground Lake , had plenty of water . At the time , therefore , the city laid no claim on the projected reservoir for culinary water . Consequently , all the water was allocated to the farmers who bought the land in the irrigation district and who contracted for enough water to pay for the dam . In the meanwhile , as El Paso grew , each new industry drilled its own wells  --  each factory , each brewery , each laundry ? both in El Paso and across the river . The number of private , city-fed water connections made in the past year is greater than those of the past ten years . And as a result of these vastly increased demands , El Paso 's underground water table has begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Umbenhauer , superintendent of El Paso 's water department , " Our big fear today is from salt  --  salt water both above and below the strata tapped by El Paso . As we remove the pure water , the salt supply moves in . If the level of pure water moves too low , the salt could pour in and destroy the supply . " The only way El Paso can diminish these drains on her underground water resources is to horn in on Elephant Butte water . And the one way she can do that is by going , ostensibly , into the farming business , since the irrigation district has promised to furnish three and a half acre-feet of water each year to the farmers in its area . So far , the city has managed to pick up only 1600 acres of marginal land below town and is urgently trying to buy 2900 acres more . It is also petitioning the Department of the Interior for permission to build a reservoir north of town designed to impound what is locally termed " wild water , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river below Elephant Butte dam . Walled off as she is from surface water by Elephant Butte , and with her underground supply in grave jeopardy , El Paso ? out where water means life itself and has been the cause of more killings throughout the city 's history than whisky ever was  --  has earnestly pleaded to be repaid with upstream water for the thousands of gallons of liquid sewage she daily dumps into the river . But the downstream farmers coldly decline and unfeelingly reply that El Paso is perfectly welcome to keep its sewage if it so desires . All this is naturally more than a little embarrassing to the present mayor , Dan Duke , in view of the fact that he ran for office on a **27;3772;TOOLONG platform . Mr. Duke , who wears diamond tabs on his shirt collars , is an earnest , eager railroad engineer who is on leave of absence from the Southern Pacific to act as El Paso 's mayor . He is a husky , square-shouldered man who might well have been the hero of a pulp-paper-magazinestory about a doughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loves to talk of the democratic spirit of the town which lifted him " from the deck of a locomotive to the highest office in the voters ' power to give . " It makes you feel good just to be around him , since he 's so genuinely and exuberantly glad that he , instead of some one of the earth 's other billions of people , is the mayor of El Paso , Texas . Of the city 's recent attainments , he 's proudest of all of its final victory in the struggle to depress the railroad tracks , which , for more than sixty years , have split the town up the middle and kept motor traffic in an almost perpetual backlash . The job of sinking this 3000 feet of track is going to cost $5,500,000 , to be split three ways among the city , the railroads and the state highway department . El Paso has voted bonds for the rehabilitation of its dingier public edifices and for the installation of a storm-sewer system that will prevent the lower parts of town from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three inches of El Paso 's scant rain in an hour or two . No public edifice in town outshines EI Paso 's absolutely top-notch munic* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ipal airport . Its rakish terminal building with the blue-tinted , eye-resting plate-glass windows is an international loading and receiving point of the very first order . Its ample runways can accommodate the giant B-36 with room to spare , and its inviting Sky Chef restaurant is as good as any in town . Yet El Paso 's big new adventure in the transportation field is the imminent completion of the Mexican Central Highway , a link of the great Pan-American Highway , which runs fromCircle , Alaska , through El Paso and on to Guatemala and Panama . Though a few stretches remain to be paved , all of it is at least graded and graveled . Mexican federal-highway engineer Ricardo Pineda declares that the entire route of the Central Highway from El Paso to Mexico City will be paved by 1950 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on getting not only her own side of the nation 's through traffic to Mexico , but the return-trip business of the heavy tourist traffic that now flows into Mexico City by way of the Laredo highway . When the Central Highway is finished , " The Pass of the North " will have taken on its full and mature significance . For then the desert principality of El Paso will also have stretched her arms across the continent from north to south as she has long since done from east to west . Thereafter , provided that her precious wells have neither gone dry nor pickled her innards in unwelcome brine , durable old El Paso , stoked on sound lunch of chicken mole and fried frijoles , can stretch out her legs and , with a feeling of progress and accomplishment , address herself to a serene and well-earned siesta .
