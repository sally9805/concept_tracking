After 13 months of hearings , the Federal Communications Commission last week approved a merger of United Paramount Theaters ( 710 movie houses and one TV station ) and the American Broadcasting Co. ( 15 radio &; TV stations , 429 radio &; TV affiliates ) . It was the first time big movie and TV interests have merged , and FCC gave its approval to the new company , to be called American Broadcasting-Paramount Theaters , Inc . In doing so , FCC overruled a preliminary FCC report , which had recommended against the merger on the ground that it was the first step by the movie industry to take over the whole radio and TV industry .
