( See Cover ) Reminiscing last week about the job that took him to the White House . Harry Truman told a piece of personal history in homely barnyard simile : " I tried to argue with those fellows at Chicago in 1944 that I did n't want to be Vice Pres ident . I told them , ' Look at all the Vice Presidents in history . Where are they ? They were about as useful as a cow 's fifth teat . ' " When he first said it , Harry Truman was roughly right ; but today , any generalization about the uselessness of Vice Presi dents falls over the example of Richard Nixon , 36th Vice President of the U.S. , who is one of the busiest , most useful and most influential men in Washington . <P> Nixon has made himself into a projection of President Eisenhower . He builds bridges from the White House to Congress , to Government departments , to the officials and people of other lands , to the press and to the U.S. public . <P> Much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unique achievement in making a real job out of the vice presidency is signalized by a sharp fact : he is the first Vice President in history to preside over meetings of the Cabinet and of the relatively new ( 1947 ) National Security Council . <P> When press of other business calls Ike away in mid-meeting , Ike turns to Nixon and says , " Dick , you take over . " One day last August , during the President 's Denver vacation , Vice President Nixon was scheduled to be chairman of a full NSC meeting for the first time . <P> Staffers sitting around the room whispered among themselves about " how Junior will do . " Recalls one of them : " After two minutes we had forgotten we called him Junior . Everything seemed natural . " It seemed natural because Nixon ( unlike Harry Truman , who was not even told about the atomic bomb until he became President ) has become , with Eisenhower 's enthusiastic encouragement , steeped in knowledge of the U.S. strategic position and policy . His advice also carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Ike on such questions as internal security ( including the McCarthy problem ) , labor policy , and general political tactics and timing . <P> To Be &; Not to Do . The amazing redefinition of the Vice President 's job can be appreciated by a glance at the records of some of the first 35 . They included a generous proportion of nonentities , some able men , and four towering figures : John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , John C. Calhoun and Theodore Roosevelt . Not one-not even the four greats-made anything of the job of Vice President .
