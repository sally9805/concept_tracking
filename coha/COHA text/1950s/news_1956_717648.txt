txt Prime Minister Eden warned tonignt that a world war could easily be touched off by hostilities in a critical region such as the Middle East . " There is plenty of dry tinder about , " he declared . " Governments should beware lest in trying to undermine long-established friendships between others they embroil ' themselves in graver perils . " Sir Anthony said that in recent months the character of the contest between the CornExcerpts front Eden 's speech will be found on Page 6. munist powers and the Western democracies had changed , " not for the better . " But he also emphasized that there was less fear of world conflict today because of " the deterrent of nuclear weapons . " Sir Anthony did not elaborate his remarks about the changed character of the East-West contest , nor did he identify the governments he cautioned . But it seemed evident that he was alluding particularly to Soviet penetration of the Middle East through offers of military and economic aid and to Communist attempts to stir up anti-British feeling in such Middle East countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony placed on the deterrent power of nuclear weapons was interpreted by some observers as giving indirect support to Secretary of State Dulles in the controversy over his " brink of war " statement . In an Interview in Life magazine Mr. Dulles was quoted as having said that the Administration 's policy of deterrence through strength had enabled the United States to avoid conflict when it was on the " brink of war " in Korea , Indochina and Taiwan ( Formosa ) . The Prime Minister did not mention Mr. Dulles nor did he refer to the controversy . But // he made it plain that Britain still was firmly convinced that nuclear weapons were the best deterrents to war . " Remove the deterrent , or take risks in pretending that it is not there , and the world outlook would be terrifying indeed , " he said . " The justification of both the atomis and hydrogen bombs is that they are deterrents so awful that no country will risk their use against itself . " Sir Anthony was greeted with cheers , and the stamping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industrial city of Bradford , Yorkshire , to deliver a speech that had been widely heralded as an answer to recent criticism of his Government . Visibly buoyed by the enthusiastic reception , Sir Anthony dismissed the criticisms as " all this hullabaloo . " Characterizing the newspapers that had attacked him as " cantankerous , " he vigorously denied that there was dissension in the Conservative party and rejected suggestions that his Government was on the way out . " As to the Government , we were elected , not for six or eight months , but for five years , " he said . " It is on our record at the end of those years that we are prepared to be judged , and I intend ? if God wills  --  to be there on that day . " The speech , undoubtedly the most important Sir Anthony has made since he became Prime Minister early last year , was devoted almost entirely to domes-J tic problems . It was only to .. I ward the end that he turned to I foreign policy . Inflation Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time to the inflation that is threatening Britain 's economic well-being and profoundly disturbing virtually every section of the community . ' He offered little that was new in the fight against inflation but pledged that his Government would pursue the disinflationary measures that have already been taken and invoke any others that might be necessary regardless of how unpopular they might be . One of the most warmly applauded sections of his speech was his assurance that a Gov- ' eminent objective was the abolition of conscription . He offered no timetable but made it clear that he was planning a long step in that direction next month when the Defense Estimates are made public by announcing substantial improvements in pay and other conditions for servicemen . The Government already has taken steps to reduce its present armed forces of 800,000 by 100 , - 000 by March , 1958 . Alluding to the speeches Soviet Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin arid Nikita S. Khrushchev , Soviet Communist party chief , had made in Asia , Sir Anthony said it was a " fantastic travesty of this country 's policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other people 's necks . " Asserting that the opposite is the truth , he said the address of the power " which dragoons and dominates its satellites is ' the Kremlin , Moscow ' . " Sir Anthony made only a passing allusion to talks that he and Selwyn Lloyd , the Foreign Secretary , are to have in Washington early next month with President Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles but he is expected to touch on the visit again when he addresses the nation in a television broadcast Saturday night . Sir Anthony said the Government did not advocate rationing and restrictions and " least of all " did it want to go back to a period of unemployment . Some conservative economists Save urged a deliberate Goveftunebt effort to create unemployment on the ground that the present tight , market for labor is a serious in flationary factor . The Prime Minister cited the disinflationary measures already taken : restrictions on credit , limitation of expenditures by the central Government , the encouragement of economy by local governments , reductions in spending by nationalized industries and certain tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the projected departmental budgets and that one of his specific aims was to reduce the number of Government employes by 10,000 to 15,000 oh top of cuts of 46,000 already made . While Sir Anthony was given an enthusiastic reception by his audience , the immediate editorial reaction was lukewarm . The Times of London felt he put rather too much emphasis , on the measures taken so far , to combat inflation and said the ' present difficulties were due to the fact they had not done the trick , But it dismissed as absurd the expectation of some that Sir Anthony would produce at Bradford " any startling or specific acts of fiscal policy . " The real attitude of the government ' can not be disclosed until the April budget at the earliest , The Times said . The Daily Herald , organ of , the Labor party , dismissed the speech as " a miserable , platitudinous flop . " The Daily Telegraph , strongly conservative was disappointed . It said that only at the end did the Prime Minister measure up fully " to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine months ago . "
