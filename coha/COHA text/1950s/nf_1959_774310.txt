txt  | Lupe loved it . Instead of looking like a simple country girl , she looked as if she were about to be presented at the Court of Isabella . This could n't happen today ? but in those days , we did n't screen-test clothes and no one saw this concoction except Lupe and me until it was time to shoot the scene . It certainly surprised the director ! It took a huge truck to transport that dress to location , and Lupe could barely move once she was in it . In those days , nobody minded except one intelligent critic , who wrote : If there had n't been so much dress , there would have been more scene . I seriously considered going back to teaching . The only reason I did n't , I guess , was that I was beginning to discover what to me is magic ? that you can actually change a person with clothes .

Howard Greer had left Paramount to open his own salon ; Travis Banton was in Europe on business ; I was completely on my own for the  | first time with a big picture and a big , big star : Mae West . It was quite a switch from ginghams , calicos and divided skirts to the velvets , satins and ostrich feathers which Miss West translated into symbols of sex .

She may not have been literate , but she was utterly articulate ; she 'd never starred in a picture before , but she was absolutely sure of herself ? fresh from the Broadway hit of Diamond Lil , which she 'd written and of which She Done Him Wrong was the movie version . She looked like no one else ; she 'd have died if she had ! She 'd created a style for herself and stuck with it . The floors of her apartment were covered with polar bear rugs in which you sank up to your ankles , the draperies were of heavy white satin , the walls mirrored , the lamps were white porcelain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the place was La West herself , in white satin negligee with a train four yards long . She dropped the negligee , and the girls measured : 38-24-38 , a full-bodied woman with perfect alabaster skin , magnificent bosom , shoulders and arms which she believed in baring at all times . Her theory : " If it 's  | worth seeing , show it . " She wore no bra , no corsets ; we 'd have no figure problems ; for the period costumes , we 'd need only to bone the bodice of each dress . " I like ' em tight , girls , " she said ; and tight they were , there was n't a costume in which she could lie , bend or sit , and I was sure that she could breathe only when I saw her survive the picture . To afford her some small relaxation , we improvised a reclining board ; it had armrests and was tilted at an angle , and there she 'd lean between " scenes in glittering splendor , the jewels winking from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrists , and every finger . I designed thirty or forty pounds of jewelry for Mae to wear as " Diamond Lil . " I first found pictures of period jewelry to show her . " Fine , Honey , " she said , " just make the stones bigger . " The period of the picture was one of the most beautiful in the world fashionwise , and she was the one woman of the modern world who could offer the figure needed to round those fashions out . There was a walking costume of lace and ostrich feathers with a lace parasol to match . ( " It may not keep the sun off , but it 's awful pretty . " ) There was a white costume of satin embroidered in diamonds and trimmed with ostrich feathers and a dust ruffle of tulle . Her very favorite was a jeweled black satin worn with an ostrich feather boa .

Green ? Never ! Pearls ? Never ! Pearls , she said , meant sorrow ; green , she said , meant bad luck . We replaced the green taffeta I 'd inadvertently made with a black satin hung in jet . ( When Shirley Booth came along years later , she also had a prejudice about green . She had worn a green dress in her first stage success ; green to her means good luck ! ) For one scene , Mae said : " I do n't have much to say here , Edith , let 's do something with this dress so at least they wo n't notice what anyone else is saying . " So we designed six swallows , big as cups , and outlined in brilliants , to fly from the left-hand waistline to the right shoulder . No one did notice what anyone else said in that scene ! For another sequence , we needed a vampirish negligee . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negligee that gave the effect of a spider web . On the shoulder I perched a huge diamond spider , anchored on with adhesive tape . When Mae wore this onto the set , the whistles and screams sounded as if the Queen Mary were docking in New York Harbor . Mae had switched the diamond spider ? to a more strategic spot . It took a half-hour to quiet the hilarity and get Cary Grant , Gilbert Roland and the crew back to work . This picture started a whole new mode in Paris . La Vogue Mae West , they called it , with feathers on hats , feather boas , velvet and satin gowns , the hourglass , totally lush , seductive look . And I , as a young intern , was even more influenced than the Paris mode . Mae West had taught me what a woman can do with a format .  | She was superbly herself ; fashion could go hang .

She knew what she knew , and made the most of it : the highest of high heels , the longest of skirts , the tightest of waists , bare bosom clay or night , hot or cold . On screen or off , she glorified this creature she had made of herself , keeping her humor broad but not grotesque , her style ditto . Hers was a wary sense of doing the right thing at the right time ; she was never late for an appointment , she never changed one ; she was informal and gay , and we became friends . Still are . As a matter of fact , as this is being written , I am working with Mae again , for the first time in years , designing a raft of peignoirs , negligees , hostess gowns and glittery evening gowns which are totally interchangeable : she can wear them in her personal life , she can wear them , just as well , in her public appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful format that impressed the intern now confronts the doctor ? confronts and confounds the world , for that matter .

Rugged individualism paid off for Mae ; it paid off , too , for Clara Bow , the patient who resisted every effort of the schoolteacher to make her authentic ? who gave me pointers , instead , on Flaming Youth . In an era when everyone in  | America wore a straight-line dress with the " waistline " somewhere between hips and knees , Clara wore a good tight belt at her natural waist ( no matter what was designed for her ) , became a star in spite of it ( her fans wrote her some twenty thousand letters a week ) , and spent all her spare time trying to reform me ( I 've always kept an old photograph of Clara , inscribed to me " With love , but why do n't you put your g belt around your waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , she added a belt . Even her bathing suit had an added belt , and with it she wore white satin pumps . When she played the part of a famous tennis player , she wore shorts , a cute sweater , high heels . " They make my legs look prettier , " she said . In a picture where she was portraying a young thing with no money , she insisted on huge chandelier earrings . The director warned me , whatever I did , not to let Clara wear those earrings . " Really , does n't he want me to wear my earrings ? " Clara said , looking at me with that pouted underlip . " Really , " I said . So she only wore one earring . In a picture where she played a manicurist , her uniform was of gray satin with gray satin pumps to match , and Clara added a diamond anklet ! She wanted to look young , sexy , the symbol of Flaming Youth . And she did , in spite of me . Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an age and good friends . The only way I ever won a point was to laugh her out of her eccentricities rather than forbid them . The  | eccentricities did n't matter , anyhow ? Hollywood had the reputation , then , for being bizarre . What would be bad taste today was amusing at a time when you could go shopping on Hollywood Boulevard with a leopard on a leash , especially if your Rolls-Royce was upholstered in leopardskin . What Clara was selling on the screen , she essentially was ? a glamorous flapper ; and what made her glamorous were her high spirits , her gaiety , her endless vitality ( she wore colors to match , hot colors : flame red , pinks , burnt orange ) . She loved parties and gave them , inviting a weird mixture of stars , directors , college students , diplomats , politicians ( once there was a prime minister ) , everybody . She did n't care what you did or who you were , if you were fun . She always had the furniture moved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be room for dancing ; she always hired an orchestra ; and often , there 'd be a motif , a Turkish party , for example , where she served shishkabob . Her house was what you might call " early Iollywood , " very elegant . One night she invited the whole t1 SC football team . She and I planned the party together and it was a darb , as long as it lasted . I wore a fringed dress and she wore pink beaded chiffon , we danced the Charleston and had a fine time ? until the football team went home . We 'd forgotten that they were in training , that they had to get in early . Oh , well , she 'd just give another party ! Clara took life as it came , day by day having fun , never thinking of the future . There was nothing small about her , nothing petty . In one picture , I had to dress her as a poor working girl ( with a heart  | of gold ) and dress Jean Harlow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( heart of stone ) . For their big scene together , Jean wore white satin , a white satin cape edged in sable , and around her throat ropes of pearl . She looked very beautiful and everyone said so . I was worried . Jean looked so very beautiful , and Clara was the star . But Clara could n't have cared less . She thought Jean looked gorgeous and did n't mind her looking gorgeous . They were very different girls , both very sexy . Jean the introvert , Clara the extrovert ; Jean cool , Clara ebullient . Her fittings were a virtual romp , Clara holding court , her three Great Danes lounging about her feet , tripping up the fitters every time they moved . " Hey ! This makes me look like a crystal chandelier ! " she 'd cry , shimmying to shake the crystal drops of a beaded sheath . We compromised . She wore the " crystal chandelier " and I added ermine tails all around the bottom of her already elaborate ermine cape . I did several pictures with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? she did n't care who did her clothes so long as she got what she wanted . If Clara taught me about unreality , Charles Laughton introduced me to reality and the importance of research . The picture was White Woman and Mr. Laughton played a planter , whose one vanity was embroidery on his vests . The vests had to be rakish but dignified , had to set him apart from other planters . He explained with relish the psychological  | implications these vests must achieve , my first living proof that great actors feel costumes are essential to their portrayal ! It was unexpected news and a happy break between my usual Western heroines and the army of bit players . When it was n't grandmas or maids , it was the children , hundreds of them . It seemed to me we never did a picture that did n't have a child for me to dress . The theatrical small fry of Hollywood invariably wore organdy dresses three inches above the crotch with lots and lots of ruffles , white Russian boots , and blond curls ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . So did their mamas . One picture called for several small girls to play proper , well-brought-up children of millionaires . The little girls were to be impeccably dressed , the quintessence of elegance and good taste . I dressed them in white French batiste with hand tucks , and they did look charming . The director , a fanatic on realism , was very much pleased , but he asked one thing more : " Please , " he said , " have the children wear the dresses home , then have them laundered so they wo n't look as if they 'd just come directly from the fitting room . " The children wore the dresses home . Next morning , when they returned , one dress was covered with lace ruffles . " The dress looked so poor , " the mama explained . " I guess you did n't realize this child is supposed to be rich ! " Now , I love children ; I even love mamas when they 're not in motion pictures . Once in the business , the mothers must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up  | to see Miss Head , they should be as nice as possible , smile as sweetly as possible , then Miss Head would make them a pretty dress . They evidently figured that the wider they smiled , the prettier the dress , because every child arrived showing her teeth , jaws clenched . With one exception . . . . A very small girl came in one day before making her screen debut in Little Miss Marker ; she had quite a few changes of costume , and one transformed her into a little medieval princess . For the first time I had a youngster in my fitting room who was not a moppet , who was a little girl ; she enchanted me , as she did everyone else on the lot . Her name was Shirley Temple and it never occurred to me that she 'd be a star who 'd outshine Garbo and Janet Gaynor . Why , neither she nor her mother ever told me how ! Between the little girls who did , and the perpetual westerns , and the ermine tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of endless petals , I sometimes felt as dizzy as an intern at his first operation . More than once I was about to give notice . The patient who really influenced me to stay was Carole Lombard . Here was an exciting girl with a flair for fashion , a casual elegance , the ability to stimulate fashion ? what she wore on the screen , women copied . I was familiar enough with the exotics , the Negris , the Swansons , the Wests , the Bows : here was something quite different : the first fashion-conscious star I 'd met , one who could influence the taste of the American woman . Carole loved tailored clothes ; she hated dresses that looked , i  | she said , " like a cross between French pastry and a lampshade . " This was for me . I took a deep breath and designed my first suits for Carole to wear , in a picture where she played a smart super-secretary . I also had to do one " lampshade " dress of tulle ( which she could n't abide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fluffy and floaty and then get limp in the rain . " I know you do n't like this type of dress , " I said , hesitantly , " what should we do ? " Carole laughed . " I do n't like hoopskirts , either , but if we were doing Birth of a Nation I guess I 'd have to wear the damned things . " At least , that 's sort of what she said . She actually used the most colorful language of any human I 've ever met , with a purpose , I 'm sure . It was part of her individualism . She could n't have found a quicker common denominator . The girls in the workroom worshiped her , the fitters begged to work with her . That 's a true barometer . Back in the workroom , when you announce a star is coming in , there 'll sometimes be a groan and a moan and a " Do I have to fit TIER ? " . . . " Heaven help us ! " . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lombard they were ready , willing and able . " Let me go too , I can carry your pincushion . " Her fittings were gay , hilarious , you could hear them six blocks off . She had great clothes sense and a true clotheshorse figure , but she did n't take clothes or herself seriously . Nothing was sacred , not even the third act of Camille ; nothing was a crisis . With her , I realized for the first time how important a designer is , not only to an actress , but to women . Anyone  | can do a pioneer character woman and make her look old , worn and travel-weary ; anyone can do a trapeze artist or a clown ; but to actually work in the medium of contemporary clothes and help with the development of a personality ? that , to me , was exciting . I 'd seen Travis Banton , in the years he 'd worked with Carole , transform her from a salesgirl to a duchess , all in modern dress . Now , in his absence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced her lean , clean greyhound look . I 've loved suits ever since , and the Lombard look . I began to realize what you could do with smart clothes . Like any novice I began to dream of miracles . I was single-handed going to someday turn Hollywood into a vision of superbly , immaculately dressed women like Carole Lombard . What a woman wears , I felt , sets the pace for what she says and does . In a print dress at a luncheon , she 'd be different than in svelte decolletage sipping champagne . What she wears conveys who she is . Carole in a Clara Bow dress would be one thing , in a Mae West dress , something else , in one of her own chic , sheathlike suits ? Carole Lombard . There was a magic power in clothes . They could develop peronality . I decided to stick with them .  | The Doctor hangs up her Shingle FIRST OF THE jungle pictures so dear to an era of escapism was The Jungle Princess ( 1936 ) . For it I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the " sarong . " Not the authentic sarong , you understand , an authentic sarong , wrapped below the waistline , would n't clear any censor ! My  | unauthentic version was made of bright , mad red , printed with white hibiscus ; and to fill it Paramount conducted a nationwide search for a jungle princess . One by one the state finalists were sent up to my clinic . We 'd dress each one in the same sarong , tuck the same white blossom behind her ear and slip the same shell bracelets on her arm . Then the pretty native would go over for her screen test . They were all very pretty , very voluptuous , and to me totally uninteresting . I was n't prejudiced against jungle aspirants , I was just not interested in jungle sarongs any more than I was in westerns . High fashion was for me ; and I had no idea , at the moment , that I 'd eventually be translating the sarong into high fashion evening gowns , play clothes and what have you ? all associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived one day , a girl with dark hair twisted into a bun at the back of her head . She was wearing a sweater and skirt , high heels , and a shoulder-strap bag , and she was incredibly beautiful ? clear , creamy magnolia skin , big blue eyes and a big bosom . The minute she took off her sweater , half the " big bosom " came with it ! Palsies ! She kicked off her shoes , pulled down her luxuriant hair and the red sarong was wrapped around her . Now a sarong has neither hooks nor eyes , it stays up on certain natives simply because they are well endowed by nature to hold it up . Dorothy was younger than she admitted at the time , and she was not well enough endowed . We helped fill the sarong out to the proper proportions and used adhesive tape to hold it in place . Dorothy was completely enthusiastic about the effect . So were the boys on the set . Indeed , the  | wolf whistle originated for Dorothy Lamour the day she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later the boys developed a vocabulary : there were 3-whistle , 5-whistle and 20-whistle dresses ; and once , when I was trying to " sell " Dottie a dress she did n't like ? a high-necked , long-sleeved , covered-up white jersey for My Favorite Brunette ? I bribed the electricians to be sure of at least a 5-whistle salute . Because , of course , Dorothy won the contest and the role . Least voluptuous of the contestants , she became the very promise of voluptuousness and in time her figure lived up to that promise . The jungle Princess made her a star overnight , and started the vogue for jungle and adventure pictures that lasted more than ten years . Long before that , Dottie was able to hold up her own sarong without any visible means of support ! The plots of these pictures were usually the same . She was always being chased by lions , tigers or elephants ; she was fraternizing with cheetahs , crocodiles and other livestock , she was being tossed into volcanoes or facing equally volcanic adventures with Bing Crosby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures ( to Morocco , Singapore , Utopia , Zanzibar , Bali and Rio ) , and other pictures where she symbolized the alluring adventuress . Luckily , she was afraid of nothing and took it all in stride , the animals , the waterfalls and the hilarious leading men . Thrown off cliffs and eaten by tigers , she emerged unscathed except for an unfortunate case of mange she caught from the tiger Satan . And she added a happy zest to life on the Paramount lot . Everyone loved Dottie because she had no delusions of  | being Sarah Bernhardt . She was strictly Dorothy Lamour , ex-girl singer with Herbie Kaye 's band , ex-elevator operator , and perfectly content to be doing just what she was doing . She would stand poised on the brink of a volcano , fling herself to the " gods " to save her " people , " and five minutes later be back in her dressing room safe and sound , munching chocolate and playing gin rummy . From the moment her first picture was released , we were deluged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sarongs above their waists , that real sarongs are made of tapa cloth ; but Dorothy in her silk sarong became the household Polynesian . During the war , when silks were scarce , her sarongs were remade over and over . Dorothy became one of the biggest names in pictures , but I never realized that until I went to Washington with her during the war . Our train was met by a motorcycle escort , there were vice presidents , senators and foreign dignitaries in the cheering section ; the Army and Navy turned out .... for Dorothy Lamour , the gay jolly girl who wanted a husband and family much more than she wanted stardom ! I remember when she and Bill Howard were first married and living on the base at San Bernardino where he was stationed . They had no kitchen ; Dorothy was learning to cook . I 'd go down to the base with scissors , sarongs and sketches , food Dorothy wanted from the Farmer 's Market and all my best recipes . We 'd cook on a hot plate and wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clothes , her screen clothes , her personal wardrobe , the wedding gown of pale blue with its slight sarong drape , the suits she wore on the war bond drives  | ( with draped turbans ) , the occasional high-fashion-clothes picture like Masquerade in Mexico , in which Dottie got her chance at white lace and shoulder-length black gloves in the return to elegance after the war . " This is more like it ! " she cried , turning before the mirrors . " I 'd begun to think I was going to have to make a career out of that jungle kimono ! " She 'd spoken too soon . She did make a career of it . And I , today , am probably the most conservative designer in Hollywood because I lived through pictures like The Road to Morocco and Dorothy 's pride-of-the-harem clothes . She and I were growing up together in the early days ; we never had time to catch our respective breaths , since she made never less than four or five pictures a year . In the middle of Dottie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Paramount : the first woman designer in the business , the first designer with a mining-camp instead of a European background . The studio sent me to Paris to complete my education , to sop up the essence of the great couturiers and come back ready for all contingencies ; the fact that I was to be a woman designing for women , who usually prefer men , was not the least of those contingencies . Howard Greer and Travis Banton had written pages and pages of advice ? WHAT TO DO IN PARIS ? and luckily I had a chance to travel with Lillian Farley , a noted model who had married Frank Farley , head of the Paramount office in Paris , where Lillian was now working for Harper 's Bazaar . With Lillian as guide and mentor , I was able to enter every  | salon as something more than a tourist , and certainly not as Paramount 's designer . So far as I knew , they 'd never heard of Paramount , or Hollywood . In our brief moments in New York I 'd already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than barbarian . In Paris , we visited every collection , sometimes two a day . In between times , I looked at fabrics . I was fascinated , awed and overcome by this first plunge into the world of fashion . I met such designers as Alix , Schiaparelli and Balenciaga ; Lillian knew them well . I absorbed them and their creations as I 'd absorbed languages at Stanford ? relentlessly . Once or twice I murmured something about the Folies-Bergere and Maxim 's , but Lillian only said , " That you can do later . " That I never did at all ; there was n't time . Lillian also said that it would be nice if I bought something , people usually did . So I bought something at every house . Carmel Snow , the famous editor of Harper 's Bazaar , was often at the same collections . She was very chic with her white hair ; she was , also , about my size , so anything she ordered , I ordered , plus anything else that was " the prettiest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs ? the difference in tax between a plain dress or an embroidered dress , the varied tariffs for silks , wools , cottons , etc . I just stuffed all my lovely expensive clothes into a huge wardrobe trunk and sailed for home . At the dock in New York , I stood under the big H and waited for the Customs official . If I had expected him to be as impressed with my purchases as I was , I erred . He was much more impressed , so impressed I had  | to call the Paramount offices in New York to come bail me out . I owed hundreds and hundreds of dollars in taxes ! When the Customs man found the thirty or forty lapel watches I was bringing to the girls on our staff , he wanted to know was I wholesaler or retailer ? But the Parisian excursion was not in vain . My first picture as head designer was Cafe Society with Madeleine Carroll . Here I tangled for the first time with a member of the international set , an English beauty who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designers in Europe , and was completely at home with haute couture . The snobbery of fashion is a potent weapon and I blessed every moment I 'd spent in the Paris salons . When she tossed " robe de style " or " gilet , " I could handle it ! A good designer does n't copy other designers ; you use couturiers , rather , as you would a good cook book 's glossary of terms ? each stands for a type of dress : the draped , the bouffant , the fluid line . I was able to tab , at a glance , Madeleine Carroll 's hat ( Docile ) , her jewels ( Cartier ) , her suit ( Molyneux ) . It all helped . I mapped out my strategy like a general . Nothing was accidental . The Clinic was remodeled in gray like the French salons . I adopted a simple , unobtrusive uniform ? tailormade suits for the most part , in monotone colors ? I do n't want patients looking at my figure , I want to look at theirs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should be the background . I worked out my clinical approach . Doctor and patient both read the script . The story is your  | Bible ; first and above all , what kind of character are we dress-ing ? " Miss Carroll , " I would say , " how do you see this woman ? " It proved to be a good approach . When I do n't agree with an actress , I often compromise . I 'll say No , she ca n't have a red satin dress with a V neckline , but she can have the V neckline and " let 's make it of black wool . " I never say , " You 'll wear a square neckline and like it . " The skill of a doctor grows with the number of patients treated and the variety of diseases . At this point , I was a just graduated medical student , and I thanked my stars for the expert crew behind me . A designer without a good fitter might as well abandon design , stuffed models are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitters , and drapers , beaders , finishers , cutters , each with a staff under her . I had inherited all the best from Travis , who 'd inherited most of them from Howard . I was lucky . Hell is paved with good designers who 've tried to build their staff in a day . With this staff to back me , I sailed into this high-fashion dress picture with enthusiasm and , surprisingly enough , no apprehension ! Madeleine was one of the leading actresses in Europe at this time ; she had done the famous Thirty-nine Steps ; this was her first American picture . A ravishing woman , she was without tensions , without any sense of hurry or pressure , indigenous to show business , as a rule , who never allowed herself to be upset or concerned about small things . She  | saved her ammunition for the big crises , and , because she was so composed , so certain everything was going to be wonderful , there was seldom a crisis . Perhaps this was possible for Madeleine because her life did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no story handicaps , and a beauty with no emotional handicaps ? I have n't had so much fun before or since ! It was the period of the robe de style ? big , bouffant , off-the-shoulder evening gowns , utterly feminine and princess-looking . Madeleine would look at herself in the mirrors and say , " Oh , how lovely , let 's have a party , " and we 'd have a party . She was crazy about food , authoritative about it . She introduced us to an Italian drink , Perna Branca , guaranteed to save you on the day you want to kill yourself . She , I 'm sure , will never need to touch it . She never flutters , never comes apart , as she proved years later when we were doing The Virginian . Madeleine was in England then , having first fitted all the clothes here , when suddenly Technicolor came in and The Virginian was switched to color . This meant all new clothes ? the more extreme lines and ornamentation used in black and white would seem overdone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be magnificent for a scene in color would have looked like a gray sack in black and white . And it was due to start shooting within days ! Madeleine flew to New York , to the Ritz . I flew to New York , to the Ritz , with cartons of clothes , trunks of clothes , and sent out an emergency call for racks on which to hang the huge skirts . The Ritz Hotel had never heard of racks , but they got them  | somewhere , and we turned the little ivory-and-gold suite into a dressmaking establishment . We borrowed Madeleine 's favorite fitter from Hattie Carnegie , and within three days did all the clothes . Madeleine had taken it for granted that everything would work out ? so , of course , it did . The bridal gown was merchandised and pictured in Vogue , my first recognition in a fashion magazine . But all was not high fashion or smooth sailing . Many of the most attractive actresses came at a time and for pictures which demanded fussy clothes . Mary Martin , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mainbocher , " it is Mary Martin , but I had her for a couple of the frilliest pictures ever filmed : The Great Victor Herbert and Kiss the Boys Goodbye , in which she was all but smothered in tulle , pantalets , ruffles and curls . She loathed these pictures as much as I did ; but she was fresh from her Broadway triumph in Leave It to Me , she 'd panicked the public singing " My Heart Belongs to Daddy , " so she was tabbed as a cutie-pie , and a more unhappy cutie pie you 've never seen . She was in a constant state of battle with the studio , pleading for a different kind of picture , roles that would give her a chance to express her personality ; but the studio was making millions and saw no reason to clip her curls . In desperation , Mary clipped everyone else 's . I did n't have curls but I did have a lot of hair , and at every fitting , Mary 'd whip out scissors and start on my mane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the bob which I 'd worn at half-  | mast soon became practically a butch haircut . My bangs were in mortal jeopardy when I started hiding the scissors . Once I got the scissors away from Mary , I let my hair grow and have never been to a barber since . When she was n't clipping my hair , I found her a fascinating person with a quick wit and expressive speech . She invented , to describe a clothes style , my favorite expression : plain vanilla . She was being given whipped-cream clothes for hot-fudge pictures , when all she wanted was plain vanilla . She knew that what she was doing was completely wrong for her , so she left the studio and went back to the theater , and to the smart clothes she loved . The other girl who came bouncing in with curls and ruffles was Betty Hutton ; but she was happy that way . Until she came to the studio , she 'd been playing in real life , on stage and in nightclubs , the enthusiastic , volatile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such . Everything bounced ; those were the kind of parts she played . Then , when she was finally put into more sophisticated roles , in Stork Club , for instance , she absorbed fashion with a mind as receptive as blotting paper . I 've never seen a more complete change in format , the more interesting because her personality remains unchanged . Betty is a restless , mercurial person who is always either very up or very down . There were times when she acted as if she were about to play Hamlet , there were times she was exacting ? she wanted everything right , and right now ? there were fittings where she was restless and hated to stand still ,  | regardless of hems that needed taking up or sleeves that needed setting in ; there were other times when she was gay and highspirited and her fittings became a circus . She always used to bring along people , friends , friends , friends , as many as twelve . She loved an audience and played up to one . As a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better with an audience ; she gets into the act , the friends get into the act . There were phone messages , wires , flowers arriving constantly , more phone messages ? Betty 's life just followed her around . And I did n't resent it ; I was fascinated observing her change from bouncy ingenue to stylish woman . She adopted white gloves , suits , the well-groomed look . She 'd had no idea she had an excellent fashion figure ; she got one look at herself and became so style-conscious that I doubt if she remembers ever having worn a ruffle . Another experiment in what clothes can do ? Veronica Lake . Veronica was a girl who actually wore tweeds , flat heels , bulky sweaters , her hair pulled back into a hairnet . And this was the girl we transformed with hair-do ( long , blonde , falling over one eye ) and clothes ( long , floaty , unearthly chiffons ) into a glamorous nymph , half witch . Veronica got a kick out of the transformation . " Pardon me while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'd created a personality that did n't exist , and from the moment the public saw her in This Gun for Hire and I Married a Witch they accepted that personality . It was an experiment that proved what clothes can do . Once Veronica was through work , changed into her own clothes and went out into the world , no one recognized her , ever .  | Ginger Rogers , on the other hand , is such a definite personality that , although she can convincingly assume the role of child or of sophisticate , the strong personality is always Ginger . No matter how you dress her , the clothes get the stamp of her individuality . She does n't really put on a costume as an actress would , but as a girl getting ready for a high school prom , wanting her dress to be prettiest . It 's a game of make believe and , because it is , she dearly loved the first picture we did together , The Major and the Minor . It gave her a chance to dress up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big moment in the picture was the one in which Ginger had to change from a young woman to a child , and she had to do it on camera . To show how the transformation could work , I dressed a little eighteen-inch mannequin and gave an exhibition for Ginger , the director and the producer . I designed a traveling suit with straight lines , a rather longish pleated skirt and a smart belted jacket with lapels that opened clear to the waistline , showing a deep V of blouse ; in the neck of the blouse , a polka-dot ascot . Ginger would wear a simple broad-brimmed hat , slightly drooping , with tailored gray bow in front ; plain pumps , medium-heeled . On camera , we started the transition at the top . Ginger took her hat , flipped up the brim , ripped the bow , let the ribbon hang down in streamers . She fastened the silk shirt up at the neck and made the ascot into a big pussy-cat bow under her chin . The belted jacket was unbelted and buttoned up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came just below the knees , using the jacket belt around the waist  | to pull it up . And the Major thought she was a Minor ! Little wonder , really . Ginger never will grow old , she has some element of clear spring in her chemistry . With one of the best figures in Hollywood , she can and does wear the beaded ball gown , but she loves the gingham dress . Now when an actress says , " Come on over to my house between five and eight tonight , some friends are dropping by . . . , " you automatically assume it 's a tea party or a cocktail party , depending on her state of health . Ginger lives right above me , off Coldwater Canyon ; she could throw rocks into my back yard ; but this was an invitation , and I dressed . " When in doubt , " I always say , " a little black dress . " I wore it : a black cocktail dress , white hat , white gloves . And Ginger screamed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was an ice cream party ! " You are n't going to mix sodas in that ! " she screamed . I took a quick look at the busy soda fountain , at my hostess in her gingham dress , open-shirted men in sandals and barelegged women in dirndls , and promptly removed hat and gloves . Ginger is like her party ? apple-pie American . When she took the Gertrude Lawrence role in Lady in the Dark , she did not imitate Gertrude Lawrence . She was strictly her own American self , Ginger Rogers , but this time in terms of a sophisticated woman in high-fashion clothes . For the number " Jenny Made Her Mind Up , " where she imagined herself like something in a circus , behind bars of a cage , we made a mink skirt , split up the front and solidly lined in ruby glitter .  | Her famous legs were encased in long sheer tights . Under a mink jacket was a blaze of the same ruby glitter . It was one of the most lavish dresses ever made in Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still show it at fashion shows as a sample of the luxury that existed before the era of budgets and economy . Only certain shades of mink photograph correctly , and at one point the floor of my entire suite was covered with hundreds of minkskins . Director Mitch Leisen , Ginger and I studied the minks and picked out the most photogenic , Ginger sitting among them , stroking them like a child . But , mink dress or gingham , my clothes never changed Ginger 's personality , she changed them . She even made me eat the fancycolored soda I concocted at her house that day . Talk about taking your own medicine !  | The First Oscar SOME ACTRESSES fit in three minutes , some take three days . The subjective actress thinks of clothes only as they apply to her ; the objective actress thinks of them only as they affect others , as a tool for the job . There are those who stand before the mirror absorbing each minute adjustment . Barbara Stan-  | wyck is the one who stood with her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have cared less . Up to the time we met , she had appeared in underworld pictures , show-business pictures , or intense dramas in which she could wear the sports clothes she loved : riding clothes , sweaters and skirts , shirts open at the throat , the man-tailored suit , medium heels . High fashion had never occurred to her , personally or professionally . " I wear mostly full skirts and sweaters . I do n't like hats . I hate brown , " said this new patient at our first conference . I listened as you do to symptoms . The Lady Eve was strictly a dress picture , and I was alxut to inoculate her with flattering furs , evening sheaths and diamonds ! Barbara walked about while director Preston Sturges explained her dual role as two sophisticated ladies : a titled Englishwoman , a lady gambler . Any diagnostic eye could tell there 'd be no difficulty in Stanwyck 's carrying high fashion . She 's small , but she has excellent carriage , a good figure , an innate poise . She listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a first-rate hand at poker . Her first fitting involved an evening gown for the love scene with Henry Fonda . It was of clinging black crepe , a sheath with the slimmest of slim looks ( she hated tight skirts ) , the lowest of necklines , a very high , very tight cummerbund ( she hates anything tight around her midriff ) , and a short jacket covered with black glitter . When she finally turned around toward the mirror and saw herself side view first ? " More people look at you sideways or walking away , how many people see you straight on ? "  --   | she was stunned . And she fell in love with high fashion ! I worked on all Stanwyck 's pictures for years . The Lady Eve , with its twenty-five sophisticated costumes , not only altered the type of picture Barbara did but , eventually , the way she dressed in private life as well . For a brief while she kept to her casual , tailored look personally . Then one night , as she tells it .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new picture . The girl fans broke down the barricades and mobbed Bob . I was still clutching his arm when a policeman yanked me , away . " Okay , young lady , let the man have room to breathe ! ' " When we tried to explain who I was , the officer just shook his head . " Do n't look like a movie star to me ! ' " I went right home and phoned Edith ... " It was the beginning of a long and happy relationship . I enjoyed it , because Barbara , with her clean-cut , arresting beauty , wears clothes well ; but she has a sense of humor that keeps her from ever taking fashion too seriously . She 's extraordinarily honest : " This looks pretty repulsive on me , do n't you agree ? " . . . Brutally frank : " It may be winterwhite jersey , Edith ; it looks like long underwear to me . " ... There is no equivocation or beating around the bush ; she does n't say " Oh , yes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be caught dead in that ! " . . . And she 's absolutely loyal . If she feels something is right , no one can change her mind . She 'll stand up against director , producer and writer , come hell or high pressure .  | In Great Man 's Lady she played the owner of a gambling hall , one of the richest women in the early West . I copied a dress worn by a noted woman of the period : black velvet embroidered with diamond birds . Stanwyck loved it ; so did I. When we ran the test , several executives suggested that , wonderful as it was , it would look even better without the birds . " If the birds go , the dress goes , " Stanwyck said firmly . " I like ' em ; so does Edith . " Rather than spend the money to make an entirely new dress .. . The format we worked out for her was always tailored ? my first evening suits , very simple , in richly embroidered fabrics . For Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket . To indicate her wealth and elegance , we arranged with a Beverly Hills jeweler to lend her a fortune in gems . In addition to full insurance coverage , he insisted upon an armed guard to accompany her at all tirges . As small Barbara walked off the set ? even when her destination was the powder room ? she was shadowed instantly by a large man , with two guns . A very impressive gentleman , as Barbara said , " At least they picked a good-looking one . " The only argument we ever had concerned wardrobe tests . The average female showing clothes just automatically models , puts one hand on her hip and walks thus . . . She 'll turn her best angle to the director and the cameraman . Barbara puts on a beguiling costume and just stands before the camera , turns around , walks . I 'd gesture wildly from behind the camera .  | " Hand on the hip , Barbara . Come on , girl .. Barbara 'd have none of it . " I 'm not a model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say . Once a costume was in action , an actual scene being shot , the clothes became part of her characterization . The same with Judith Anderson . Judith Anderson can look a hundred different ways ? she can look dreadful or beautiful , radiant or pathetic ? she 's what I call a true " clothes chameleon , " she can translate herself into anything . A little woman , not much taller than I , she can indicate regal height if need be . Like other top actresses from the theater , she is n't interested in her personal likes or dislikes but in whether clothes are right for the part . She is a vibrant , high-keyedwoman , dynamic . I 'd like someday to have her in a picture where I could do really dramatic clothes . Loretta Young is another story . Here is a girl with whom you have only one trouble ? she looks too beautiful , too elegant , and it 's almost impossible to make her look anything else . She wears clothes so well that they 're likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , for I 've known her since she was " Gretchen , " a slender fourteen-year-old girl in The Crusades . The beauty was there then , and the promise , and the enthusiasm she still carries with her , there 's nothing like a Loretta Young fitting . Some actresses do n't wish to see anything but the finished product . Some get confused if you show them fabrics . Some like to see just one sketch , one fabric , etc . Loretta wants to  | see everything , and I " rig the stage " until the Clinic looks like the Arabian Nights . There are bolts of all the most magnificent materials ; the spotlights are on ; Loretta stands before the mirrors trying each fabric while we discuss them . Clothes are her passion ; she handles herself like a model , and you know that whatever you put on her will be seen and noticed . For The Perfect Marriage she played a fashion magazine editor named " Maggie " who finds she and her husband , played by David Niven , arc drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him back , and the clothes to turn the trick could be dazzling . ' I ' here was a skirt of slim white jersey with a huge overskirt embroidered in gold and silver paillettes in a paisley pattern . ' flee overskirt doubled as a cape . This I still use repeatedly at fashion shows , as I do many of the " Loretta Young " dresses . There was a white suede cloth sleeveless jacket embroidered all over with the name " Maggie " in gold . This was widely copied commercially , using cotton , wool or silk braid , rickrack or colored string for the name . The " Maggie " nightgown made the cover of Life , and for Life 's inside layout I designed a gown for each of ten anniversaries , all modeled by Loretta , of course . Loretta is not two people , she is always the same ; her elegance on screen merely reflects her elegance at home . We used to have " clothes clinics " at her house , sitting in her dressing room , going over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This year I 'm going to be very feminine and wear frothy clothes " . . . " This is my suit year , Edith . What do you think of this as the basis ? "  | Gretchen looks fragile , but when she 's talking clothes she can outlast me . For that matter , she can outlast anyone on anything ; behind that femininity is a will of steel . Once I got in the middle of a slight difference of opinion between her and her producer . It concerned ten gold chains she had selected to wear around the neck of a basic black dress . They looked very smart , but the producer said : " One gold chain , Edith ; please tell her . " " All the gold chains , " Loretta told me . " Please tell Loretta one gold chain is enough . " " But I like all the gold chains .... " " One , " said the producer . " You 're the designer , tell her , Edith . " So Loretta wore ten gold chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually , she found a charming way of avoiding unpleasantness . If there were troubles , she said , " Edith , do n't worry . We 'll just call my agent . " The agent handled any dirty work while Gretchen and I had the fun ? up to our elbows in the very stuff of fashion , talking a language we both understand . Ilka Chase speaks the language , too . One of the best dressed of women , Ilka was literally raised in the lap of Vogue ( hex mother was its long-time editor ) ; and I felt considerable apprehension when she came West to make two pictures , New York is not always charitable to West Coast designers . To my great joy , she thought Hollywood was fun , and she had a true zest for clothes ( and everything else ) . In both pictures , she played a well-dressed sophisticated career woman , herself .  | When a script called for her to commute constantly between East Coast and West , I designed a twin lapel watch to fasten into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , one Los Angeles time . We concentrated on dressmaker suits and , as " Anatole " would say , they reeked of chic . Ilka 's style is so definite , I merely designed for her . If I 'd had to make her into another character , it probably would n't have been so easy . Ingrid Bergman I had to dress first as a nun . The picture was The Bells of St. Mary , and the prescription was fairly simple . I visited the Mother Superior at Immaculate Heart and worked out a costume satisfactory to the Church , but not a replica of any order . A nun 's habit is slightly frustrating to a designer , and I was aching to design , but Bergman was perfectly happy . When we met she was wearing flat heels , no make-up , a monotone sweater and skirt , and she looked just fine . Luckily , our next picture , Notorious , called for high style and I had a chance to experiment . Ingrid is not a small woman ; she was the tallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but she has such bearing and carriage it does n't matter that she is n't the skinny model of the fashion magazine . Men notice clothes on a woman like this more than they do on the fashion models ? she makes what she wears come to life . Some women need accessories : jewels , furs , extreme hats , feathers ; the simpler Bergman 's lines , the less ornamentation , the better . Simplification is the best medicine for making a beautiful woman more beautiful . Best  | example , the sculptured white jersey , almost Grecian dress she wore in this picture and in which she looked something like the Victory of Samothrace . She loves freedom of motion , she dislikes high color , and that 's about all I can tell you in re her taste . Her response to clothes ? Talking about other things . She 's a woman with interest in art and literature , and , except for the moments when she 's before the camera , she is not an actress , not a star , no trace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shop . With Bergman , I did shop once , to find a hat we needed for picture purposes ; but she 's shy ? she hates being stared at , and she does n't like staring at herself ; she 'd rather have been in an art gallery , and the next day we went to one , to see an exhibit of scenes from famous plays in miniature , dolls taking the place of actors . This she enjoyed with her spontaneous childlike interest . When I think of Bergman I think of her at a time like that , with her happy voice , her infectious laugh . There 's a calmness about her , an assurance , and an incredible optimism . She is very gay , almost naive . And I think of her teaching me to jitterbug . We were guests at a beach house ; we were listening to music and talking about dancing ; I said jitterbugging looked difficult . " You do n't know how ? " asked Ingrid , and promptly proceeded to teach me . The greater the actress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the compensations of my particular prac-  | tice is meeting actresses with background ; another compensation is meeting certain great ladies . Ethel Barrymore , for example . I was n't nervous , but I was careful approaching Miss Barrymore . I need n't have been . She has the greatest charm , and a warmth to match it . " I 'm so pleased you 're going to do my clothes , " she said . " How do you see the picture ? " I had sketched the character in several ways ( headmistress of a select finishing school in Just For You ) . Without the slightest hesitance , Miss Barrymore selected . " This is the way I should look , this is the length I wear my skirts , this is the neckline I prefer ; I could n't 1 ) c more pleased . " She has worked out a format for herself , even her hair style suggests the classic head of Ethel Barrymore on stage . Certain women have this perfectly worked-out format . Queen Mary of England had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it , and Ethel Barrymore . To women of this surety , fashion is amusing ? they know what it is , but they need n't follow its whims . Miss Barrymore keeps her waistline at her waist ; she always has . I felt it an honor and a privilege to dress her ; we chatted about the theater and I was fascinated by her extraordinary face and voice . And do you know , I could n't possibly tell you what she herself wore , or , for that matter , what clothes I designed for her ? It did n't matter . But in 1948 costumes mattered . That year , designers were first given recognition by the Academy of Arts and Sciences , and I had high hopes for a picture called The Emperor Waltz .  | I can tell you every detail of every costume for that one ! The picture was set in the time of Franz Joseph ( 1904 ) , an era of feminine , perfectly bewitching clothes . Everything a lady wore emphasized that a lady was a lady . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shoulder , tiny waists , the rose tucked in the bosom , the parasol , the fan , the veiled hat ; from skin out , emphasis on provocation . No one could have worn the costumes for this princess with more finesse than Joan Fontaine , who always looks so princess and so proper and who can , on occasion , surprise you with her change of pace . " Would you like a cup of tea ? " I asked one day when she arrived , breathless , for a fitting . " I 'd like a glass of cold champagne ! " she said , and promptly had an ice bucket and the wine brought up from her car . I 'd worked with Joan before ; I knew how well she 'd wear these hourglass styles , and I was n't disappointed . Sure of myself I 'd never been ; but seeing the daily rushes , I knew : these were the loveliest clothes I 'd ever seen . They would certainly win the Academy Award . What could possibly be better ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a dress of black , embroidered in gold and silver , high-necked , with long panels of the same Oriental embroidery . The motif of the design : tiny elephants whose trunks turned up , a sign of good luck . I could n't lose . The award went to Joan of Arc . I 've never been sure of anything since . 1  | Actually , the basis for the Academy Award is not how beautiful the costumes are but how much they contribute to the picture , how integral a part they are of telling the story . I won my first award the following year , with The Heiress . The costumes were not pretty ; the problem was to make Olivia de Havilland unattractive . The fabrics were harsh serge , stiff wools , uncompromising as to color , severe as to neckline . I dressed Olivia as a mature woman rather than as the girl she was , and placed her against a background of women who looked young and gay . At the dance , where the others wore tulle and organdy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , toward the end of the picture , when she wished to get revenge on Montgomery Clift , allure him , we made a complete transition into softer , more feminine colors and fabrics . Let me also add that every detail of these costumes was correct down to the last buttonhole . Olivia not only joined me in the research , she initiated some of it . We visited museums in New York together , studying original petticoats and corsets c , f the period ; we read Henry James 's Washington Square , on which the script was based . Olivia would come flying in with a wonderful scoop , some detail of lingerie , some way of fixing her hair , all absolutely authentic . At fittings she tried out the motions of walking , sitting , dancing . Costumes of this period ( mid-nineteenth century ) are treacherous , because of the understructure ? the pantalets , corset covers , hoops ? and because of the width of the skirts . Dedicated and thoroughgoing as she is , Olivia worked out the mechanics and wore her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miriam Hopkins , fresh from sables and diamonds on stage in New York , was cast as Olivia 's aunt . Not just an aunt , but a poor aunt . Not just a poor aunt , but a widow . Up to my ears in accuracy as I was , Miriam almost seduced me . " In those days any woman could be attractive , " Miriam said sagely , " no matter how poor . She could use an enchanting little lace collar and cuffs ? why , this is the kind of woman who would while away the hours making little lace cuffs ! Would n't she , Edith ? " Now I have a great respect for stage actresses . I know that to them reality is a religion , so . . . But when we were finally ready to show the costumes to Willie Wyler , I had misgivings . Miriam looked as little like someone 's aunt as possible , and not in the least impoverished . Mr. Wyler circled her like a prospective buyer . " I do n't feel we quite have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . The " poor " aunt 's costumes were done over , and with the same flawless respect for history and personality we 'd used on the niece . After all the liberties we 'd taken in the days of erminetrimmed bathrobes and decolletage westerns , The Heiress was good for my schoolteacher soul . It certainly was the best job of costuming I 'd ever done , and it won an Oscar . This time I was n't excited , and I did n't dress up . Oscar was a year late . But he was golden , and he never turned black like my silver loving cup .  | The Doctor looks at life ACTRESSES HAVE LITTLE in common . They are as diversified as women in any walk of life , and , as women in any walk of life , their motives , manners and goals differ widely . Every cultured , charming star with whom you work gives you something . But you learn , too , from the less talented , the ambition-  | driven , the would-bes . They are all human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 've been coping with one of the breed so in love with herself and her looks that no designer can handle her , one who usually affects the spectacular , out-of-this-world clothes associated with " gone Hollywood . " Each has her own way of coming to terms with life ; and often when they take their clothes off they take their hair down . I 've observed the careers of happy women and tragic women , some so timid they put on their costumes alone behind closed doors , some delighted to show their black lace panties studded with diamonds or their pale pink lingerie embroidered with well-known names . Some arrive in best bib and tucker to impress me ? " Just a tired old Balmain , " they 'll sigh . Others effect the most casual of casual clothes to show how little impressed they are . I 've had brothers , aunts and mothers , children , uncles and lovers brought to fittings . Some of them made an appreciative audience , some thought I did n't know fashion from a hole in the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after living in mining camps all my childhood , it 's a hole in the ground . Some of them gave me helpful hints ? no extra charge . I 've also played host to tigers , baby elephants , cats and dogs . Jean Wallace brought along her parrot Louis to see how he 'd go with her gown , since the bird 's appearing with her in the picture . Louis behaved a good deal better than some of the children who 've been raised by progressive methods ? if the little darlings want to eat a pin .. .  | No two fittings are alike . Dietrich never stops to rest . Hedy Lamarr spent a good part of each fitting on the horizontal . Under my spotlights in a slinky , gold-beaded gown , she 'd look like the all-time femme fatale . Then , suddenly , she 'd turn those great translucent eyes on me and say , " Edith , I must rest . When you have had children , you have backaches . " And , half-finished though we were , down she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd lie down even oftener . She ate constantly . A Hedy Lamarr fitting meant food shuttled in every hour or so , Viennese pastries , pot-roast sandwiches , anything to eat ; and , while she rested , the sultry , exotic temptress munched and talked of her three children . Hedy is the most unself-conscious siren ever born . She 's as relaxed and boneless as a Persian cat ; she has no temper , she likes to wear dirndls and simple blouses ; she has never been even momentarily confused between self and symbol . She knows what she looks like , but she does n't work at it ; and this ability of hers for relaxation means she 'll never have a " wrinkle or a bulge . Typical Hedy Lamarr clothes are slinky black with pearls , slinky beaded gowns , slinky chiffon peignoirs . What she designs for herself ? and she loves designing her own personal clothes ? neither slinks nor slithers . Even in her screen clothes , there was a point where she 'd draw the line . For Samson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hedy could n't fill . " I 'm not a big bosomy woman , " she said ( she 's slim actually ) ; " if you pad me I 'll look ridiculous . I wo n't be able to act .

" So her costumes were not padded ; we achieved a voluptuous effect by line , by drapery , and nothing could have been lovelier than the Delilah I took to Mr. de Mille in a costume of mesh and beaten silver , so lovely he actually smiled ! For Mr. de Mille 's smile you almost forgave Hedy her predilection for the horizontal and the edible . Iledy always thinks like a woman . Bette Davis thinks like a businessman . Hers is a truly organized point of view , and working with her I 've felt like being in conference with a bank president . You can see the authority on screen in her walk , her voice , her action ; there 's not a trace of indecision ? she 's the same on screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sensational experiences I 've ever had . She came in like a small whirlwind , the first time . There was no polite chitchat . She 's a busy woman , I 'm a busy woman , and we both knew it was a nice day . She 'd come , actually , to see if we had the same point of view . " This is how I walk , " she said ( it 's a walk like a whiplash ) . " I must move freely . If clothes do n't move with me , I ca n't wear them . This woman ( in June Bride ) is a career woman ; she works for a magazine ; and strangely enough she 's a lot like me . How do you think she should dress ?

Bette liked the coat dress so much she had six of them made for herself in varied colors . She was wearing one the day we started working on All About Eve . She strode about , hands deep in her pockets , studying the fabrics , the sketches . For each costume , I 'd place my favorite sketch on top , then alternates . In nothing flat , she 'd whipped around the room , selected each of the top drawings , and was saying , " When do we fit ? " This is never a tense or dramatic woman , it 's a woman terribly interested in whatever she 's doing and doing it with tremendous energy , and enthusiasm . . . a brilliant woman , who enters into a story conference less like the star than like the director , her concern with the whole not with herself . . . an impatient woman who has none of the usual female vanity , she never thinks , Do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it good for the part ? . . . A small woman , not thin , she can look tall , regal , short , chic or slovenly , whatever is needed for a scene , and each scene is played to the hilt . Up here in the Clinic , Bette " does " the entire picture . Each dress has to be tried for all the action the scene will demand : the taffeta dress for the drunk scene , the suit ( with its tight skirt ) for the scene where she throws herself across the bed . Unfortunately there was no bed . That did n't deter Bette . She seized my two big ottomans , pushed them against the couch , took a running leap , dropped her mink ( no one can drop a mink more elegantly ) and threw herself ! The skirt held together ! " Guess it 'll work , " she said .  | All About Eve was an exciting picture from the beginning . You smell smoke when there 's a good fire and this was good . Bette 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of her form : no accident could throw her ; any fault ? in costume , dialogue , or what have you ? immediately became in her hands an asset . When we tested the brown taffeta dress trimmed in sable for the party sequence , the dress slipped repeatedly off her shoulder . What to do ? Could we use tape ? A net yoke ? Elastic around the neckline ? Bette shrugged and it promptly slipped off her shoulder again . " Why not let it ? " she said . The dress was moving with her , it was right . We had lunch one day after the picture had become a success and I 'd won an award for the costumes . We talked about businesswomen not being very feminine . It is n't true , of course . " You ca n't fool me , Edith , " Bette said . " You may live with potted cactuses but you love hearts and flowers . " And the next day she sent me a great flowered heart . The career girl who does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis enters like a whirlwind , Jennifer glides in like a gentle breeze . She 's a calm , romantic girl who has developed an individual style of her own ? poetic , charming , almost Victorian . I think of her always carrying a sable muff with a bunch of fresh violets in it . She loves pretty clothes and they suit her . She 's one of the few in pictures who can wear period clothes without making them  | look like costumes ( in Sister Carrie , for example ) . When I first had her in Love Letters , I found her a sensitive and interested patient . She was to play a girl who had lost her memory , and we tried soft , fragile wools to establish the mood . Many stars have first and last say on costumes ; but Jennifer prefers having her director or producer make decisions . She gets things done by a charming , passive feminine approach . In Love Letters , Hal Wallis thought the wedding dress too conventional , too pretty ? not in the right mood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I liked best , and I was upset . In this instance , the patient soothed the doctor . " Never mind , Edith , we 'll use it somehow , someday . " Jennifer must have confidence in the people with whom she works , once she 's sure . . . . I 've been called in several emergencies . Once , in the middle of the night , David Selznick phoned me . An important scene for his Ruby Gentry was to be shot next day , and Jennifer had broken her linger . It was n't the pain that was bothering her , but worry over how the broken finger might be concealed . The " cure " was a special cuff that would fasten to the splint and a huge ring to fit over the splint . It did n't interfere in the least , it even added a little to ' the Victorian charm . Another emergency concerned her last-minute replacement of Elizabeth Taylor for the Academy Award presentation . She described by phone what she had , and I suggested a pearl-white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's key .  | A key is what each woman must have , and no one ever had it more superbly than Gloria Swanson . It 's been a long time since she drove up with her Marquis and we threw roses ; but Gloria today is still Gloria ? a star , a fashion plate . Can you imagine what a thrill it was for me to do Sunset Boulevard ? Trouble , too ; for in this picture Gloria was to look like an actress who has passed her peak , a star in the discard , living on memories . I based the clothes on what she had worn in earlier days . ( We used the very same shoes . She wears a size 2 ? ; you ca n't buy that size in Los Angeles today , but in Wardrobe we found size 2 ? ' s with Gloria 's name on them , shoes she 'd worn twenty years before . ) We made the tests ; went to a projection room to view them ; and what happened was utter consternation . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen just about as she had twenty years before . She walked on in a pair of tight jersey hostess pajamas with an overskirt of leopardskin ? and there she was , not in the least like a has-been . There was very little I could do about the clothes to accomplish the effect needed . It had to be done with make-up and lighting ; because , no matter what you put on this woman , she walks with the air of a woman who knows she 's glamorous . This is no actress who 's just discovered a format ; this is an actress who has been herself so long ? first of the four-star stars ? that she 's used to herself and stardom is as natural as breathing . You pay her homage because she is this , and because she 's the living example of what she preaches : that clothes are  | supremely important , that a woman must never be caught any time or any place looking less than she should . If today 's stars sometimes run out to shop or to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen better days , this lady does not . She is meticulously groomed , whether in black jersey smothered in black fox or in a dark grey wool dress with small black hat , bag , gloves and shoes . She wears hats with everything except her nightgowns . If you drop in at her house unexpectedly , you 'll find her in smart slacks , her hair up in a turban , looking completely assembled , completely like a motion picture star . She 's small and likes to emphasize that smallness ; so , even when a shoulder-length mane of ' hair was popular , she kept her small look by wearing a bandeau or a turban , keeping her hair close and neat . She never allows color to overpower her either , staying with black , gray , brown and beige . She has an unusual face ; why not let people sec it without being distracted by the color of her gloves ? Gloria is a woman of the world who has lived in all the great capitals , makes many TV appearances , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interest her friends as well . Recently she visited me and talked of world politics . Women are important to politics , she was saying ; professional women who have so much to contribute should not be engrossed in their own profession to the exclusion of international affairs . I have n't found out yet what she has in mind for me to do in politics , but I will . What she has in mind for me in terms of reforming my food habits I already know . Gloria is a devotee of brewer 's yeast ,  | whole-grain health bread and organically grown vegetables . She feels that you live and look according to what you eat ; and I must admit that , sitting across her dinner table , observing her faultless skin , you seriously consider throwing away your lamb chop for her oats and greens . " It will rejuvenate you , Edith , " she says , handing me a gold-wrapped package that might have come from Cartier 's ? a loaf of her bread ! She 's not the first star who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I deal with creative women , and , much as they revere my advice , they 're sure I 'm a babe in the woods so far as my self is concerned . Mary Martin tried to fix my hair ; Clara Bow wanted to give me a waistline ; from Loretta Young to Carolyn Jones , they 've tried to change the spots ? but no one ever had more plans for me than Jane Wyman . She 's a changer by nature , a very definite girl , a perfectionist , and not one bit intimidated by my venerable status . " I think I 'll have roast beef , " I may say , glancing at a menu . " Are you out of your mind ? " cries Jane . " You can have that any time ; let 's have something deadly and wonderful ? the cold salmon with cucumbers vinaigrette . You spend too much time , Edith , eating what you think is good for you . Listen to Mother . " One day we were having steaks and Jane ordered hers with chopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she noticed that I was eschewing the onions . " Why do n't you eat your onions ? " " They make me ill. "  | " That 's all in your mind , " cried Jane . So I ate them . " How do you feel ? " she asked , phoning me during the afternoon . " Ill , " I said , and was . Jane is a gay girl , and I like her . When she came to me for Here Comes the Groom and for Just for You , she was fresh from a series of heavy dramas ; she had n't been thinking in high-fashion terms , and it was my turn to say , " Now listen to Mother . . . . " Actually , Jane is a type . She is very young in appearance , very pert , and in personality not at all the heavy dramatic girl . She has none of the star complex , but she does have a definite idea of what she can and can not wear . She prefers simple clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to the teeth . Jane is n't about to agree with anything you tell her ; but you can always argue . Sometimes she wins , sometimes I do . In Just For You , we needed a theatrical costume and I had sketched a black net number with black net hose . Jane took a quick look . " I ca n't wear anything that short , Edith . " " Why not ? " " I 'm not a pin-up girl . " " You have beautiful legs . " " It 'll have to be longer . " So we made it , fit it and even Jane had to admit that if she 's not a pin-up , she 'll have to do till a pin-up comes along . As a matter of fact , we finally made it even shorter than the sketch had suggested .  | For her personal wardrobe and for the screen , I like Jane in very tailored clothes . Her face is so unusual you do n't want frills or fluff or extreme styles to distract from that face or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The greatest brain storm Janie ever had in my behalf was when we were making Lucy Gallant . In it she was to play the very chic owner of a dress salon . The action of the picture included a fashion show , and Janie decided that no one should commentate that fashion show but me . " It 's type casting , " she said . " I 'm not an actress ! " " I 'll coach you ; it 'll be a breeze . " " What should I wear ? " I said . " A traditional suit . Do n't worry about a thing . Now listen to Mother . . . . " The next thing I knew , I was cast as Edith Head in Lucy Gallant and was studying my script . Now , I 've been on radio and television , I 've taught school , I 've lectured to women 's clubs and commentated numerous fashion shows . This was n't going to throw me . But as zero hour approached , I found myself running around muttering my lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should appear without my glasses ; that the audience reaction to them on screen would be : " Dark glasses ! Hollywood affectation . " On the fatal day , I reported as per call , in make-up , at 7 A.M. My hair was done ; my face was done ; Jane had had a smock made with my name on it ? that cheered me some-  | what ; but now that I was made-up , they would n't let me put on my glasses for fear of smearing . I wandered about in a fog , hunting for the sound stage . When I finally did find it , I discovered that Jane had arranged my dressing room right next to hers and that my name and a small star were in evidence on the dressing-room door . At nine , I was ready and waiting ; but nine , ten , eleven and twelve came and went and the fashion show had n't been called ? or me . " Come on , I 'll take you to lunch , " Jane said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " I 've got to put my glasses on ; I ca n't stand it a minute longer . " We wrapped my frames in cotton and at least I could see ; but when I ran through my lines , Janie was horrified . So were Thelma Ritter , Claire Trevor , Charlton I Icston . " Edith , you 're mumbling ! " Jane said . The others nodded corroboration . " Thank you , it 's such a pleasure to be here and meet the governor , " I mumbled over and over while they ate . I could n't eat , I could n't swallow . I could only say , " Thank you , it 's such a pleasure . . . " We got back to the set at one o'clock . Work went on . One , two , three , four , five . . . I was still rehearsing my lines . I was almost frantic . I 'd never realized acting was such a difficult business . Finally , at a quarter past five , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models were lined up , the fashion show started , and I stood there commenting on clothes , as I 've done hundreds of times ? only this was different . ThiF  | time there was a camera looking at me , and I could n't see it . Without my glasses , I could n't see much of anything . " Look this way . " . .. " Pull in your tummy . " . . . " Do n't duck your head . " . . . " Camera . " . . . " Action . " .. . I 'll tell you frankly , it was the worst day of my life . I did the scene ; I saw the rushes ; I promptly gave up acting . And I 've had a slightly higher regard for all my lovely guinea pigs ever since .  | From Circus to Grand Opera My PRACTICE is n't limited to motion picture problems . I 've designed costumes for circus and opera , for television , for Las Vegas , for nightclub and benefit appearances , even for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamarr sitting atop an elephant the night of St. John 's circus benefit , dressed  | elegantly in chiffon trousers and a few well-chosen beads ? Or Barbara Stanwyck , in velvet riding habit and plumed hat , riding a trained horse side-saddle around the ring ? Or Effie Klinker taking to television with Edgar Bergen in an original jumper ? Or Marialice Shivers wearing a gown of mother-ofpearl lace for her husband 's second inauguration as Governor of Texas ? ( The gown was copied from one we 'd used in a fashion show in Lucy Gallant . Governor Shivers , playing himself in that picture , had asked that if he were re-elected , would I copy that dress for his wife ? He was , and I did . ) My patients lead pretty dynamic lives and their clothes personalities go with them . One recent assignment : Freddie Brisson 's Broadway production , The Pleasure of His Company , which gave me a chance to work again with Cornelia Otis Skinner . We worked together first on the movie , Our Hearts Were Young and Gay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as co-author and technical advisor with Emily Kimbrough . Theirs was a story of their own youth in the 20 's , when as flappers they went on their great pilgrimmage to Paris . I 'd been through the flapper era with Clara Bow , but Cornelia and Emily did n't know that ; besides , theirs was a different kind of flapper ? guileless girls searching for glamour . In Paris they spent all their precious money for white fox coats that promptly disintegrated . We had some very gay consultations and hoped someday we 'd have a chance to do a picture with more exciting clothes . Then I had Cornelia for The Uninvited with Ray Milland . This time she was the actress ,  | but with just one costume change ; so again we said , " Someday ... " Then it happened . In The Pleasure of His Company she plays a smart , well-dressed modern woman , a successful woman , not unlike herself . Perhaps the clothes are a shade higher key than Cornelia actually wears ? she has so many alter egos on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . For the stage , however , she feels , " The audience must know who she is the moment she walks on . They make instant judgment before they 've even heard her speak ; and they resent deeply being deceived . She ca n't look like one thing and be another . " Since the first scene is spring in San Francisco , Miss Skinner appears in a gray suit lined with gray-and-white print , with a matching print blouse , white hat , the whitest pearls and gloves . With her own vivid coloring and brown eyes , she conveys positive health , alertness and vitality . She 's a woman with a grown daughter ; her husband still loves her , and she 's interested in how she looks . In the same scene , incidentally , Dolores Hart , playing the daughter about to be married , wears a soft suit , in taste similar enough to her " mother 's " that " mother " might have selected it . The mother 's clothes and the daughter 's clothes are n't competitive because actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go in and buy " one suit for a woman of forty-five , please . " It 's the personality and the figure that count . For Cornelia Otis Skinner , I planned the same type of clothes I wear myself : smart , simple , no frippery . She is a tall woman and I 'm  | a small one , but we have the same point of view : we would n't be caught dead in a pinafore , we find being adult an exciting thing . " Is n't it wonderful ? " Cornelia says . " By the time you 're adult you 've found out what you can and can not do , you do n't try to do things that play against you . You stay within the frame of your own capacity , just as you stay within a character on stage . You do n't try a character you ca n't believe or that the audience wo n't believe ; you should n't in real life either . " Those of you who 've seen her on stage in The Pleasure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult and fresh in her black chiffon , her Oriental silk hostess gown , her mossy green day dress . Clothes for the theater differ from movie clothes because detail matters less and the total effect , full length , is always on . I went to New Haven for the tryout and was as jittery as if this were my professional debut . Another recent departure , the record album " Lizabeth , " Lizabeth Scott singing . For the album photo in full color , Scott asked me to do a dress that would capture the effect we 'd achieved once in a picture where she played a nightclub singer . " I 'm not a nightclub singer , never was ; the dress gave me the armor that made me feel safe in the role , " she said . Confronted with the record album , she wanted the same look and the same feel . Now , most nightclub singers are arrayed in glitter ; they 're underdressed and sheathed so tightly every high note threatens to burst the whole . For Scott I used no glitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | cool blue jersey , dramatically simple . Scott is herself dramatically simple , and she plays parts much like herself . She dresses the same for her roles as for real life . So does Anne Baxter . I 've designed for Anne for more than ten years ; she was one patient who had worked out her own format before she ever arrived at the Clinic ; not a patient ? a collaborator , wanting not help but new fashion . She is a girl with many interests ; she 's smart , sophisticated , and loves sophisticated clothes . So you can imagine how frustrated we both were when she was cast in ' 17w Ten Commandments as the Egyptian princess , Nefertiri . I 'd been doing research on this picture for years ; I was completely aware of Nefertiri and her sinister , hawklike brooding face , the face of a lady vulture . And then in walked Anne , with her pert Irish look and tilted nose ! We both suffered over that one , but The Ten Commandments has made nothing but money ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Egyptian ? where does that leave us ? Suffice it to say , we 've had a good deal more fun designing clothes recently for Anne 's TV appearances where her very definite personality can be very definitely enhanced . My first exciting brush with television was when NBC opened its big studio in the San Fernando Valley and Roz Russell was mistress of ceremonies . She wanted to look like " a famous MC " and she knew I 'd done work for television before ; so in she came to the Clinic and we worked out a happy diagnosis . Roz is a great clotheshorse . She has a model 's figure , a model 's assurance , plus a gay , vivid per-  | sonality ; I " did " her in charcoal chiffon with flat sequins . It photographed black . The chief difference , incidentally , between designing for television and for movies is a matter of lighting . On a television set , you have overhead lighting . On live TV you do n't change the lighting for close , medium or long shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In making movies , you camera-test all wardrobe before it is used . There 's no time for this on TV . In movies , you also see daily rushes . But here we were going on before an audience of forty million with no preview , and you play it safe . For black : dark blue or charcoal ; for white : light blue , pale gray or off-white . I never use color per se , what I want on screen is black , white or gray . Roz 's dress was very slim , long-sleeved , low-necked ? now for some attention-getters to add drama . We tried a short stole , a long stole , a fur cape . They were n't dramatic enough . " What would people least expect me to wear ? " Roz said . " The world 's largest muff . " And I sketched one promptly , a gigantic black fox muff . " Also a small black feather hat . " A few days later , she stood under my spotlights trying on hat after hat . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were trying for the total look . Roz would put on a hat , take up her muff and pantomine the world 's idea of a movie star . " Too , too beautiful ! " . . . " Too , too sweet ! " . . . " Too , too chic ! " . . . Roz would say , making hilarious fun of herself . " How can I look smart , Edith , without frightening people ? Without looking like a caricature ? "  | We ended up selecting a small explosion of black feathers : Roz batted her eyelashes , laughed , and agreed it was right , it was smart , it would n't frighten them ( too high fashion frightens some people ) . In designing for nightclubs , as differentiated from television or movies , there is the difference again in lighting . You must be careful not to select a color that will turn pea-green when hit by an amber spot , and the effect of your clothes is always full length rather than close up . That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty Hutton and subsequently for Rosemary ( looney . Rosemary is another girl who first came to me with white fluffy dresses , full skirts , little waists , bows on the shoes ? the young girl look . She was well dressed and expensively dressed , but she had n't jelled . She flitted from dress to dress with equal enthusiasm ; and the very fact that people call her " Rosie , " that she is a natural blonde with curly hair , then a singer with a band , led her to favor very feminine girlish styles . For this same Rosie we worked out practically a uniform ; suits , sports dresses , dinner clothes , formal clothes , always the same short length ( which suits her proportions ) with emphasis on the collar and neckline . The clothes are simple , sophisticated , of plain fabric and color , because essentially you do n't notice what this girl wears , you notice her vitality . From the beginning , Rosemary 's attitude was : " If Joe likes it , I do . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked him first . This is what you call " making a clothes personality " ; we  | experimented first with various necklines , various silhouettes ; I even had Rosie come into the gallery and we photographed her in our experiments . ( If they would photograph women in department stores , and the " patient " could see the picture , she 'd often say , " Oh , NO ! " Frequently , when you look only in the mirror , you see just what you wish to see ? say , from the waist up . ) From the beginning , Rosemary was an interested patient and one who took the medicine prescribed . I 've known her and designed for her on three different levels : for pictures , for nightclub engagements , and for the pregnant woman who wants to be smart and pretty . She 's been pregnant four times in almost as many years , and Rosemary 's not the kind of girl who can just retire and look enceinte . She works in television and nightclubs , she travels with Jose all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called me : " Edith , we 're leaving for London next week . We 're going to meet interesting people and go to many interesting places . I ca n't get into a thing , and Joe is such a snob about clothes ! " He is ; and Rosemary dresses for him . I designed for her a series of full-length coats with deep inverted pleats and a Clooney collar . We 've had these made in every color and fabric from black taffeta to beige linen . This last time they were no longer recognized as maternity clothes , they were the same shape as the then popular trapeze . Rosemary keeps coming back ; many of my patients do ? that 's what 's so pleasant . What is frustrating is not to get a  | few of the patients you 'd like to have . Deborah Kerr is one ! She is a friend , and I wish we had more time together . Friendships are n't easy in Hollywood . We 're all extremely busy ; there is n't must time for friendship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many actresses , by the very nature of their ambition , must have a strong core of self-interest and selfconcentration . Deborah has the capacity for friendship ; she has intelligence , warmth ; she 's a real human being . And one of my tragedies ! I 've had her for two pictures , both " costumeless , " The Proud and the Profane , for example , in which she played an Army nurse in an Army nurse 's uniform . The one lovely gown I 've ever designed for her was an aqua satin for a benefit performance , at which she was master of ceremonies . It was an impressive gown , with a full length , exquisitely embroidered stole ; it literally swept onto the stage , and Deborah adored it ? until she tried to sit clown . The dress would n't sit ; she had to bring it back to the Clinic for a further operation so that it could go to the theater , etc . Most people think of an Englishwoman as being reserved , slightly cool . Deborah is reserved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has such an infectious gaiety ! When she comes in for a fitting , we ca n't wait for her to take off her clothes . Last time her underslip was embroidered in pink roses and " Spring is here . " Another time , she wore a petticoat that said , " What 's new ? " Another of my tragedies is Joan Crawford . I 've known Joan since Clara Bow days . One of my hopes has always been ,  | " Someday I 'm going to do a picture with her ! " And then it happened . The picture was to be called Lisbon ; Joan moved onto the lot ; we sipped champagne and nibbled fresh caviar every evening in her dressing room , and went over sketches . It was the sort of assignment to dream of . Joan was playing a very , very wealthy woman , a very beautiful woman , a woman with superb taste . Our materials were ordered , the patterns were in work , the designs for jewelry sent to the jeweler , the shoes ordered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a great mannequin . Then , for some reason I 've never understood , Lisbon was called off ; Miss Crawford moved off the lot . Someday I 'm still going to get her ? for a picture , a TV stint , or an appearance at the Academy Awards . One of my extracurricular duties is as consultant to the Academy , and during the month of March the number of problems and diagnoses are of epidemic proportions . For instance , in 1958 Eva Marie Saint called in to say she was going to have a baby , she did n't want to have a new dress made , did I think she could get into the black velvet I 'd made her for That Certain Feeling ? We moved a few hooks and Eva Marie made one of the most successful appearances of the evening . Zsa Zsa Gabor brought in every dress she owned , tried them on ; we decided against all of them . ( I could n't make her one , she was n't under contract . ) Then she phoned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three beautiful dresses at Elizabeth Arden 's ; I do n't know which to choose . " I met her after work at Arden 's . The dresses were stunning . and Zsa Zsa , perfect example of the word " female , " is in her element in an evening gown . ( I 've never seen her in tailored  | clothes ; she typifies extravagance , high fashion removed from reality . ) My only trouble was saying which , and I finally decided on the pale , pale pink . On the night of the Awards , Zsa Zsa phoned me . " Darling , I have a surprise for you . I 'm not going to wear any of those . . . " The Awards are important because they are viewed by such a large audience . For a designer , a large audience is important ; it is very rewarding to have a patient like Dorothy Kirsten and to see her on the firestone 1 lour on television or singing in concert at the Iollywood Bowl in creations of mine . With her glorious operatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried television , loved that ? tried Las Vegas , was mad about it  --  - still continues singing opera ; and I am involved on all fronts . The Opera News , March 17 , 1958 , carried this note : Dorothy Kirsten , on leave from the Metropolitan this season , celebrated her 50th Tosca in 1liaiui , singing four performances in eight days . Edith I lead , award-winning Hollywood designer , created a new second act gown for the diva : royal garnet velvet trimmed in diamonds and topped by a full length cape of the same material lined in gold lame . I used no motion picture touches on Dorothy 's Tosca costume , I merely translated a person who is very blond to the role of a brunette . Tosca was a successful court singer , the gown could be as regal as you 'd wish , the velvet would look handsome on stage and no worry about it photographing too bulky . When you 're designing operatic clothes for a movie , you  | must watch the bulk ( as I learned in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirsten Flagstad ) . But when I first designed for Dorothy Kirsten , the picture was Mr. Music and she was playing a great prima donna off stage , in lovely modern clothes . Dorothy , thank heaven , is a woman who is not built like the traditional opera singer : she 's a tall , beautiful blond Viking and I dress her off stage exactly as an opera singer does n't look . She loves clothes ; she has a flair for wearing them ; she 's an outgoing person , easy to work with ? indeed , I discovered that opera has less temperament than motion pictures ! I even made her wedding dress , of palest blue-white lace , and for Las Vegas we 've had a field day , with prima donna clothes that convey , we think , the popular idea of how an opera star would look . This is strictly the " first night " look : magnificent brocades , sables , jewels , lames , velvets ; and so far as the nightclub circuit is concerned , these clothes are Dorothy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fresh , short young evening dresses Clooney 's . Nightclubs have become the " theater " of our day in terms of glamour , while pictures have become concerned with realism . We are now primarily in a period of personality clothes . The way an actress looks on screen or on television or on the street ? much the same . For me , it 's a far happier era than my apprenticeship , when I was constantly involved with the bizarre . And of course , in designing these modern personality clothes , I 've worked with some of the most exciting personalities of all time .  | glamorous guinea pigs EARLY IN 1952 , I hurried to New York to show sketches for the picture Roman Holiday . The film was to be shot in Rome , the young star was appearing on Broadway in a play called Gigi . She had never had a large movie role ; I 'd seen the test she made in Europe , but the test had been shot in  | pajamas and I had no idea , really , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little dark suit with white collars and cuffs , very simple , very elegant , with a sprig of lily-of-the-valley in her buttonhole , fresh white gloves , her whole person clean and shining ? a little girl with the poise of the Duchess of Windsor . Her figure and flair told me , at once , here was a girl who 'd been born to make designers happy . If she were not an actress she 'd be a model or a designer . As it is , she 's all three : a girl way ahead of high fashion , who deliberately looks different from other women , who has dramatized her own slenderness into her chief asset . A good model figure is at most 34-22-34 . It 's a figure you seldom see in movie business . During a " bust " season , you 'll have actress after actress boasting a 38 or 39 ; and during any season , your top dramatic stars are likely to be short and not necessarily symmetrical . Audrey has the perfect model figure : very slim and tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pads ; she accentuates her slimness ; and she has the cultivated taste so dear to a dress doctor . Audrey knows more about fashion than any actress save Dietrich . Like Dietrich , her fittings are the tenhour not the ten-minute variety . To the sketches for Roman Holiday , she added a few of her own preferences : simpler necklines , wider belts . I returned to the coast , had the clothes made , and we tested them in New York . When I saw the test , I knew that this was not only a fine actress ( I 'd already caught Gigi ) but one of the greatest models . The clothes translated her perfectly from a prim little princess to an eager  | young girl on the streets of Rome . Audrey won an Oscar for Roman Holiday ; so did I , and I looked forward to her next picture , Sabrina . Planning the clothes this time , . I went up to San Francisco where she was playing on stage . I took with me pages and pages of " little Audreys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which Audrey could doodle dresses . She loves to design , and we worked like a team on the Sabrina clothes , in which the chauffeur 's daughter goes to Europe and comes back tres chic . The director broke my heart by suggesting that , while the " chauffeur 's daughter " was in Paris , she actually buy a Paris suit . I had to console myself with the dress , whose boat neckline was tied on each shoulder ? widely known and copied as " the Sabrina neckline . " Audrey and I went shopping in San Francisco ; she wanted me as confrere and audience . Shopping is her idea of fun , and no wonder ? no matter what she tries on ( size eight or nine ) , she looks simply delicious . " And now let 's celebrate , " she 'd say when we were exhausted , and that meant heading for the nearest confectionery to devour two of the biggest , fattest , most chocolate French pastries . ( When she lived in Holland during the war , food was scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl is one person off stage and on . The charm that made her a star is the same charm she uses when buying a loaf of bread : it 's her own personality . And coupled with this charm and magnetism is the mind of a diplomat . If she could run for president , she 'd make it . She knows art , music ,  | clothes ; she speaks four languages fluently , is shrewd , intelligent , and has an international background ; but best of all , she has a positive approach . Luckily , she 's not about to run for president , she 's too busy with her two roles , as actress and as Mrs. Mel Ferrer . Incidentally , here is a girl who consults her husband on any personal clothes . Where many women dress for men before marriage , and for women after marriage , Audrey says it would n't be fun to wear clothes unless Mel liked them ; and she takes home all sketches for him to see . Of course he likes the clean , uncluttered look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , the exaggerated use she makes of fashion . High fashion is part of her life , part of her consciousness ; she imitates no one . You have favorite pictures ; you ca n't help it . Roman Holiday was one because the clothes were good and Audrey was just right in them . A Place in the Sun was another . Elizabeth Taylor was seventeen at the time ? one of the prettiest human beings I 've ever seen ; gay , enthusiastic and excited about clothes ? and let 's have no mistake about it , it 's fun to dress someone who gets excited . Here we had a perfect setup : one of my favorite producer-directors , George Stevens , and a beautiful star with a flawless young figure playing a girl of wealth . The clothes were widely copied . One evening gown had countless yards of white tulle studded with countless white velvet violets . One of my young friends reported a party she attended at the time of the picture 's release ; in attendance  | were seventeen " Elizabeth Taylors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young ball gown of black velvet , topped in eyelet embroidery and studded with seed pearls . I 'll always remember Elizabeth saying : " You can make the waist a little smaller . " " I 've already made it a little smaller . " " You can make it even a little smaller ! " She had a nineteen-inch waist at the time and she was always trying to get us to make the waists just a little smaller . She was a friendly , uninhibited girl with none of the tricks or traits of the usual child actress who knows she 's important and finds a way to let you know . Elizabeth was n't a bit actressish , and she still trotted about the set with her schoolteacher . The teacher came with her to fittings too . I suggested that a couple of fittings might count as schooltime , if we spoke in French and Spanish ; but the teacher did n't think that quite legal . Halfway through the picture , Elizabeth graduated , and we had a party in the commissary without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . Monty Clift was at the party ( he and Elizabeth had become close friends ) , and the cutter , Tommy McAdoo , and Elizabeth 's stand-in and her mother . All very gay . What impressed me at the time was that Elizabeth was afraid of nothing . She was playing a very taxing picture with a very important producer-director ; she showed not the slightest strain ; she took each day in stride . I found this same attitude several years later when she suddenly replaced Vivien Leigh in Elephant Walk . Many things had happened to Elizabeth :  | her first marriage had collapsed ; she was now married again , had just had her first baby , and was stepping into the shoes of one of the world 's top actresses almost on a moment 's notice . She was more sophisticated , and more individual than ever in her beauty ; she had acquired a great sureness about clothes and fashion ; but she still took each day as it came and displayed not the slightest apprehension about anything . Where Liz Taylor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she introduced me to the teen-age point of view . I 'd had fan mail from teen-agers , but they were teen-agers with problems . From Liz I learned about normal teen-age ; and its point of view is a law unto itself . It does n't necessarily follow the dictates of fashion ; it follows its own dictates ? and I think it should . This is an age of great creativity : they 're trying to work out a fashion vocabulary for themselves , and it 's a group vocabulary to which a girl had better adhere . It 's very unwise to isolate a girl and make her " different . " Ask any teen-ager ! The objective of the teen-age look is to be very casual when you 're casual , and very dressed up when you 're dressed up ? no in between . Day clothes are underplayed ( deliberately of course ) ; evening clothes are far more sophisticated and older than a teen-ager should wear . The day clothes could be worn by a five-year-old , the evening clothes by a twenty-five-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teen-age point of view . She sold me completely . I figured if all teen-agers had this joie de vivre , they could ignore high fashion .  | I did n't know Mitzi Gaynor until she 'd grown up , but she tells me she was " awful ? fat , long hair , and overdone , if you know what I mean . " She gives credit to her husband , Jack Bean , for the present Mitzi ; and if he helped her achieve it , more power to him ; because she 's a girl not in the least subdued . As you know , I hate third persons at fittings ; but Jack came along with Mitzi for Anything Goes , The Birds and the Bees and The Joker Is Wild ; and I found him , far from an interloper , an ally . Mitzi is inclined to look at clothes from her own taste , " I like it " or " I do n't like it . " Jack is more objective , he knows that clothes have to take a part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a great ham ; I 'm mad alxut them both . Essentially , Mitzi ca n't wait to try on each new style . She 's full of exuberance and bounce ; when we got her into her " red-spangled strait jacket " for Anything Goes , turned on the spotlight and flipped open the doors ? Mitzi gave us a show . She has a rounded female figure , good bosom , tiny waist , and she can really sell a costume . If you think she puts on a performance for Jack , you should see her when we finally go down to the set . Some actresses go to the set well hidden in a bathrobe . Mitzi says : " Now , we 'll make an entrance " ? and does . Everyone whistles , applauds and lifts Mitzi up to the crest of the wave . Every Gaynor costume is a success ; it ca n't lose . June Allyson , on the other hand , came to me with a firm set of inhibitions about what she could and could not wear  | In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flyer and the sweaters and skirts she likes were suitable . However , there was one scene calling for an evening gown with a bare top . Junie just looked at me . " I do n't wear dresses like that . " " Why , June ? " " I do n't look well in dresses like that . " She went into a long dissertation on the shape of her shoulders ( which are actually very nice ) , the shape of her neck ( which is just fine ) . Finally I said : " June , let me make it with thin straps . Then , if you 're desperately unhappy , we 'll make a new top . " The dress was of white Swiss organdy embroidered in cherry red . The bodice was low , with little , thin straps . It was the one dress June bought for her own wardrobe from the picture . What this girl has is a basic fear of clothes in terms of fashion ; she does n't experiment , she does n't trust it ; and for once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has built up a June Allyson look , and her public likes it , her family likes it , she likes it . Then , I say , I would n't change June . Designers are inclined to make people look like models . But essentially , a model is anonymous , she 's a living form to show off clothes . A person wears clothes to express personality . June is the prototype of the girlish American . It 's an attractive look , a healthy look , sometimes slightly quaint , and it is June . She 's very small , a size five or seven ; she can wear clothes well ; but she 's found her spots and she 's not about to change them . I say , more power to her . Ditto Kay Thompson . Here is a woman with such a definite personality she 's almost a caricature of herself . She has  | caricatured her height , her slimness , her brittleness . Many tall , slim women say , " What can I do with myself ? " Kay shows them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a code : a two-piece costume with a short , short skirt and a long , long jacket , a tiny sailor collar at the top . She wore this from tweeds to chiffon . It became a long skirt for evening wear . The point of her uniform was that here was the editor who told every woman what to wear ? " Everybody must wear pink ! " ? but for herself , " I would n't be caught dead in it . " She announces that every woman must wear different clothes for different moods , and then proceeds to wear her two-piece suit . Kay , personally , is like a firecracker ; she gives vitality to everything she puts on ; for fun she assumes the voice of her precocious Eloise , the funny , squeaky voice of a little girl " shot with arsenic . " Including Eloise , Kay is completely Kay . This is what each of us is trying for ? to be completely one 's self . No one has achieved this better than Miss Katharine Hepburn . She knows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every change of fashion , but she looks fashionable , and you would n't dare to say she is n't well dressed . She is . She 's developed a technique for being herself and she never makes the mistake of trying to be anyone else . Miss Hepburn wears high necklines , waists low in back , slightly longer skirts with fullness at the bottom , not the top . She likes gray , pale lemon-yellow , white , and beige , and her basic garment is the shirt . The collar-and-cuff look frames her  | face . For evening , she wears strapless or sleeveless dresses in rich fabrics , simply made , and always she appears distinguished , smart , utterly Hepburn . We had a mutual friend , Constance Collier , so I 'd heard a good deal about Miss Hepburn , how definite she was , and met her with some trepidation . But The Rainmaker was a stimulating experience . " This is the way I usually like clothes made ; it 'll save us time . . . " said Miss Hepburn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks ; if she wishes to look gauche , the length of the sleeve can show it ; the skirt too long achieves an awkward look ; so does the belt too wide or too narrow . In the picture , she could n't have looked less attractive . She played a character brought up with men , in a rural world . In the farm clothes she was enchanting . When she wanted love , and changed herself ( her father advised ruffles , flowers and frills ) , she looked horrible . Very few actresses have the courage to make themselves unattractive ; but Miss Hepburn is interested only in the picture . She would use a bit of lace , a red bow , a pinafore , and achieve effect . I could n't keep off the set when she was working . The way she walks , talks , the way she moves , crackles with energy . She even puts on shoes like a dynamo . Hers is a driving interest in people , in everything . When she found out I was going to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go here ; she 'd send a list of shops ? where I was to go to buy what , what I was to do , what I was to see . It tickled me , because often actresses come to me to ask where they should go . Miss Hepburn told me.  | So did Eva Marie Saint , but in another way . This delicatelooking blonde arrived in full skirt , sweater and flat shoes , without make-up , a representative of the new school of actresses who do not wish to look like actresses , the Actors ' Lab . They all dress the same way , as if by formula . I had seen her in Waterfront and on television in Our Town ; I knew Eva Marie was an actress and a fine one . What Eva Marie told me , very pleasantly but surely , was she did not wish to acquire the " Hollywood look . " The picture was That Certain l " c'eling , a comedy with Bob Hope . It called for very clothes clothes . I did not show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sat down with her and analyzed the character . " This is a girl , very New York , vcry elegant , very feminine , " I said . " Two men are in love with her ; she is moving in a high-fashion world . It 's a part where clothes actually help the story . " It was the right approach . Eva Marie became , at once , a fellow intern . We took her lining ? the first step in any diagnosis . Off came the full skirt , the sweater , etc. , and Eva Marie slipped into a muslin strait jacket that shows all . She has , I discovered , a perfectly good figure . As a matter of fact , eventually she admitted she 'd once modeled in New York . But clothes are not her interest . We went into long discussions of the character , what clothes could do to help her change her personality , adapt to the high-comedy tone of the film . There is always the chance that dressing an actress in something she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she feels unhappy . . . The purpose of our long  | confabs was to find what would help her , what would hinder her . The only thing she balked at was jewelry . She wore small pearl earrings and a string of small pearls ; costume jewelry she does n't like and there was no reason she must wear it . The clothes were pretty sensational ? very chic , very smart ; with the black velvet evening gown we had a velvet stole lined in ermine . Eva Marie fitted and said nothing . I think she was surprised to see what a very different person she could become ? and she can , she 's versatile . She can be pretty , elegant or drab ; speaking clinically , she is a type who can be changed into a number of women . But she said nothing . At the end of the picture she went away ; so did I. When I returned , one of my first phone calls was from Eva Marie Saint . She had seen the picture and wanted me to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked ! Eva Marie 'd never thought of herself as glamorous . I 'm not sure she has yet .  | glamorous guinea pigs ( continued I WAS TO meet Rita Hayworth in the very plush offices of Hecht-Hill-Lancaster , than which there are no plushier : one whole wall a cage , filled with exotic-colored birds . It was the emergency call for Separate Tables . I 'd been alerted the night before at six , read the script at home , I 'd rerun Rita Hay-  | worth 's last picture that morning ; and now , at noon , here I was . I 'd never met Miss Hayworth , but I regarded her as a big star ; I 'd seen press photos of her from all over the world in some of the most wonderful clothes imaginable . One of the most publicized women in the world . . . The love goddess . . . I wore my best Balenciaga suit , uncomfortably high-heeled pumps , handmade suede gloves , a hat you would certainly call smart . And two seconds later , in came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweatshirt . She wears no make-up . Her hair was long and loose . She walks quietly , sits quietly ; she is one of the shyest people I 've ever met . It was the first in a series of surprises . Director Delbert Mann discussed the glamorous woman of the play , who is trying to recapture her former husband . She is not a desperate woman , she is a woman trying to be as seductive as possible . I waited for Miss Hayworth to give me the usual pitch . First meetings are usually neat bits of fencing , because nine out of ten actresses come to you with preconceived ideas of what they can wear and what they want . Instead of saying so , they tell you how glad they are you 're doing their clothes and that they 're leaving everything in your hands . Or they tell you how glad they are , and mention casually , " I 've always gotten my things at Balmain , " or " You know Mainbocher does all my things . " In either case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you show sketches , the actress 's true personality begins to show ; she tells you ex.ac lv what she likes or does n't like , the kind of wardrobe she wants ? in short , what she should have said  | in the first place . ( Sometimes , for the second appointment , the actress brings mother , sister , and/or best friend , and asks them what they think . Usual answer , " Nell , I do n't know .... " ) Miss Hayworth gave me no pitch . Our second meeting was at her house . She lives near me and suggested I stop by the next day on my way to work . By this time I had some sketches and 1 was on guard . Now I 'd hear exactly what the score was . I think I expected her to be " at home " in a negligee , probably by Elizabeth Arden . Inviting me over could easily he a preamble to showing me a lot of clothes other designers had made for her . She opened the door looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf shorts easily two sizes too large . " Imagine me talking to a designer in these . I have n't had time to have them made smaller ! " And we looked at sketches . I 'd seen the play in New York ; so had she , and I thought she 'd be interested in how we were interpreting the clothes for the screen . The black dress for the big love scene , for example . . . On Broadway it was of satin with a low V neck . For Rita , I 'd suggested a black French wool , embroidered in the smallest black jewels and not such an uncovered dress ? certainly not a V neck ; she has a pointed face and broad shoulders . The embroidery had a reason , for the love scene on the ( lark terrace , you could catch body motion by the reflection of light on the tiny gems . What kind of neckline would Miss Hayworth prefer : square ? oval ? round ?  | " I like all of them , " she said simply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and waited for reactions . No reactions . . . The more you know about what an actress likes , the easier it is to please her and suit her . You do n't want to forcibly superimpose your taste . Rita 's only contribution was in the matter of color . She loves warm , tawny color . I decided at once to do everything in tones of her hair and eyes : topaz , sherry , caramel . Although they photograph gray , she 'd feel happy in them . Even in the baggy golf pants , you could see she has an excellent figure ? the lean-hipped model look . I knew she 'd been dressed by the great designers of the world ; I expected her to talk clothes . She did not . She was unworried , disinterested , I thought , until the day she was to arrive for her first fitting . She phoned to say , " I 'll be a little late , but it 's important , I 'm having my hair cut . " Now , what I dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pincurls ( she 's going to a party tonight ) and who tries on a lovely dress looking like Aunt Jemima . I 'd more or less expected Rita in tennis shoes , pincurls and a bandana . She arrived in high heels , hair perfectly dressed , as she 'd wear it in the picture ! I 'd expected complete disinterest , and certainly her manner had been one of detachment ? until she put on the first gown . The minute she was in the fitting , it was like a fire horse hearing the three-alarm . She came to life . She was alert . Nothing interferes with her fitting : no retinue , no agents , no phone calls , no distractions of any kind , and Rita herself says little . Hers were the quietest fittings we 've ever had , and , accustomed  | as we are to exuberant actresses , we were n't really sure she liked the clothes . I was n't sure until the picture was over and Rita went on her wedding trip . The picture of Mr. and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rita in the caramel suit of French wool she 'd fitted without comment . This was a rare time of quiet in the Clinic . Often , when a top star arrives , it 's as if a bugle were blowing : royalty . Hal Wallis himself escorted Italian star Anna Magnani ? and her interpreter . This was Magnani 's first picture in America and it was a big moment , the star talking rapidy in Italian , the rest of us talking English . An explosive moment ! Her eyes blazed , her gestures were eloquent , she shook her hair dramatically ( she was wearing it in the Magnani manner , and , in the Magnani manner , black slacks and sweater ) . She shook hands warmly ; but if this was a moment of great pleasure , the interpreter failed to convey the message . Hal Wallis introduced us , and left ? the coward . " Tell Miss Magnani how happy I am to work with her . I wish she 'd tell me how she sees the character in The Rose Tattoo . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The interpreter translated this to Italian . " You have seen my pictures ? " asked Magnani . " Everything you 've done , " I said quickly . She understood that without the interpreter . " Rene , " she said . We talked back and forth to the interpreter about the blouse and skirt she 'd wear in the first scene , before her husband 's death . She is a happy woman , she 's in love , she goes to the store , it 's a normal woman living normally .  | " Once the husband dies , " I said , " I feel the woman has no interest whatsoever in how she looks . " The interpreter waded back and forth between us . It was pretty heavy going . We got to the scene where she 'd wear a slip . Before the interpreter could say a word , Magnani broke in . " But the slip must not fit well , " she said , her black eyes dangerous . I began to feel an undercurrent . Miss Magnani obviously understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word " slip " I felt sparks in the air . " Material for this slip must not be good , " she said . Ah , she evidently felt that I felt all lingerie had to be of handmade silk . " Disheveled , careless , the slip , " she said . " Decollete , " she said . And the way she said it you knew she meant decollete . Her French was beautiful . I switched to French . Los Angeles accent or no , I was n't getting anywhere in English . " The clothes should show the disintegration of the woman ? from a healthy , lusty woman to a slovenly , dispirited one . N'est-ce pas ? " I was doing better . " At the end , when she is beginning to become more normal , we can get a little glamorous , " I said . It was a fatal mistake . " Never ! Tell her ? never glamorous ! " cried Magnani to the interpreter . I tried to explain that I was using the word loosely ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the first blouse . " I think a print blouse , " I said . " You have some old print blouses ? " Magnani asked .  | We had ; we brought some from Wardrobe and she tried them . " Let 's use these , and make them over , " she said , " so the material is not new . " Incidentally , when Magnani undressed , we were amazed . Under the black slacks and sweater was the most exquisite of black French foundations . That night I had a second surprise . The studio had called the press in , to meet the star at a cocktail party . I do n't know how I expected her to look ; but when I arrived , I was greeted by a handsome , elegant woman in an elegant black silk dress , hair beautifully coiffed , and bearing no resemblance to the woman I 'd met earlier in the day . Magnani ! It was n't until several weeks later that I realized this great actress had been terrified of me , terrified because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood glamour girl . When she saw the rags I made for her , she began to soften , brighten and blaze . I 'll never forget the day we finally became friends . She 'd come in to fit the slip , the one costume that had worried her the most , the thing she was afraid would look like French lingerie . It did n't . It was the most dreadful old thing . We 'd made it of material from an old slip and constructed it as it might be done in a small Italian town , a bit on the bias at the waist and practically no sewing ? no seams , no darts , no fit . Anna took off her own sheer French slip and dragged on this horror . It hung like the original sack . " Molto bene ! " she exclaimed to herself in the mirror . " Motto bene . " I laughed . " It has n't been easy , has it ? "  | " Not hard , " she said . " I worried before I met you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they might try to make me over ? pluck my eyebrows , you know ? I am Magnani ! I do n't want to be made over . " She shook her hair for emphasis . And again , no designer in her right mind would ever try to change her . She is herself , and she can transform that self completely by the way she wears her hair . She is a robust woman full of gusto , a dramatic actress to the bone ; and everyone reflects her . If she is happy , everybody working with her is happy ; if she has a headache , she 's dying ; if something goes wrong , it 's a disaster . She 's excitable , communicable , emotional ? a human Vesuvius ; nothing is tranquil , nothing sloughed off , and being around her is exciting . I have seen her explode in her dressing room , tear off the old coat she wore in Wild Is the Wind , throw it on the floor and weep with rage . For one awful moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't . She was upset over some facet of acting in the scene just shot . But for the most part , she loved the picture and was very gay . In the beginning of Wild Is the Wind , she came bursting in , loaded with good spirits , an armful of magazines with pictures of cowgirls , blue jeans , divided skirts , Stetson hats , and boots she 'd had made for herself in Italy . She understood that this was a picture of the Golden West . It was up to me to get the news through to her that this was not a picture about cowboys , but a picture about sheepherders . She understood English well by now .  | " There 's a fine sartorial difference between a sheepman and a cowman , " I said . Magnani laughed heartily . Everyone laughed with her . And I turned her loose in Wardrobe to try on endless pants , boots , coats and dresses . The one dress to be made was for the party scene , when her husband has given her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a middle-class , American-looking party dress . It was a disaster . " It is not possible , " she said . " I will bring in one of my own dresses ; it is just right . " She designs her own clothes , incidentally ; and simple and smart , even stark , they are . The one she brought in was a sheath with a loose back panel that hung from the shoulders . It was sleeveless , high-necked , very dramatic , made of heavy , black Italian silk . " This is my original design , " she said . " Never let any other actress have it . You , personally , may copy it . " We made it for her in black linen , embroidered with hot pink carnations . We had regained the Magnani look . A look is every woman 's aim . For Jane Russell , it 's a sexy look , so that even when I had her for a western , Son of Paleface , with nothing but cowgirl outfits , they had to be Jane Russell clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really going out to rope cattle , Jane 's looks as though she could n't possibly rope anything but men . I used glove suede for Jane 's cowgirl clothes , because glove suede clings ? and that 's what it did , all over . For Pearl Bailey , it 's a bouncy , gay , sexy look , and even  | when she plays a maid , as she did in That Certain Feeling , the maid 's costume was fitted like a ball gown . For Eartha Kitt , it 's a sexy pussycat look . She has a true feline quality and the fringe on her costumes never quite lies down . For Doris Day , it 's a clean-cut , crisp , typically American look . When Doris first arrived for The Man Who Knew Too Much , she said : I 'm not going to tell you what I like or what I do n't like ; I 'm in your hands , Edith ? dress me . " She was absolutely safe . Doris is such a definite type , she looks so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change her . I 'd hate to have to dress her as Scarlet O'Hara . I think the secret of her smartness is that she 's found the clothes in which she feels comfortable . If the effect today is casual , its achievement was not . I discovered that when I reran her old pictures . Look at those early films and you see a grown-up Meglin Kiddie , replete with buttons , bows , ruffles and curls , who bears no resemblance to today 's Doris . I was amazed . Then I ran Julie , her first independent production , and an abrupt departure from what had gone before . Here Doris emerged with clipped hair , she wore her own clothes , and she was right . I dressed her exactly as she dresses in The Man Who Knew Too Much . For Teacher 's Pet , as a journalism teacher , she wore suits . Here we had no trouble , Doris loves suits . Trouble appeared in the shape of the one dress for the nightclub sequence . My point of view was that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , less casually , offering contrast to what she usually wore .  | We made a dozen sketches , and finally compromised on a cocktail dress , but a plain one . Doris worried over that dress . She 's a chronic worrier ? but only about clothes . Otherwise , she 's full of vitality and full of zip , and very much a little girl . We went shopping one day . She bought all kinds of things , things she needed and shoes and hats she did n't need at all , but they were so pretty . In each store she has salespeople who know her , and there is the friendliest , warmest relationship between Doris and these people . She 's one actress who is spontaneous and unaffected , and , as she says , " gets a bang " out of little things . " I 'm hungry , " Doris said , in the middle of shopping , and steered me to Biff 's lunch counter . Most actresses would have selected the Derby , or Romanoff 's , or Frascati 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cheeseburgers with everything on them , and the biggest malted milks I 've ever seen . She enjoyed this as if it were her last chance at food for the week . Two hours later , in her dressing room , I found her eating graham crackers piled with peanut butter . " This is one of the dreamiest things in the world , " she said . " Let me make you one ! " As someone else might say , " Let me show you my latest Picasso ! " Doris is a blow to a designer , because in sweater , skirt and no make-up she looks as well as when you 've worked on her , doing your best . Glamour adds nothing ; it detracts from her . Many of today 's young stars have good figures ; they 're pretty , but they 're in a new tradition ? they do n't look like  | stars , off screen . Janet Leigh could be the young clubwoman ; Vera Miles , Ann Blyth , Hope Lange , Joanne Woodward , Kathy Grant , Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be pictured easily on the society page rather than the movie page . And then there are the individualists , like Carolyn Jones and Shirley MacLaine . Shirley fits into no mold or pigeonhole . She 's the most completely uninhibited , completely honest person I 've ever met . " Edith , you may think this is elegant , " she 'll say ; " I think its awful . " " Why ? " ? " I look like everybody else ! " I make some change ? skirt length , sleeve length or belt , so that Shirley feels like Shirley . A designer should not force her taste , and the individual with strength to be the individual has the assurance that is one of clothes ' prime objectives . Shirley has it . I may say , " Shirley , how are you going to wear your hair to the Academy Awards ? " " Like this , " she 'll say ? " upswept haystack . " I do n't always agree , but who asks me ? Not Shirley . Not Carolyn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's paid off . She 'd been around here for some time , a naturally pretty blond stock girl who was getting nowhere . Then she dyed her hair dark , developed bangs , a big , blueeyed stare , a different kind of talk , a different kind of walk , everything . Now her approach is very positive and electric ;  | on screen she can wear extreme clothes : the wool and cellophane dress that looked like a wet snake in King Creole , the slinky black number in Showdown Hill . Carolyn 's clothes on screen are clothes designed as male bait , and when she shows them , she shows them : " Is n't this just the jazziest , Mr. Wallis ? " wriggling along in pale-green jersey that is strictly an eyecatcher . Carolyn and Shirley arc little laws unto themselves ; but most young actresses want help , need help , and , fashionwise , they 're quick-change artists , they learn faster than their more established sisters . Dolores Hart arrived here one year ago , an eighteen-year-old student from Marymount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail ; I nicknamed her " Junior . " What has happened to Dolores in one year is unbelievable . IIcr first picture was Loving You with Elvis Presley . She played a fresh-faced girl , very pretty . Then she played with Anna Magnani in Wild is the Wind , then nothing much happened except that her name kept appearing on fan-magazine polls and she made King Creole with Presley . Her first real break was on Broadway in The Pleasure of His Company . Day after the opening , unknown Dolores was the rave of New York . Next big break , opposite Montgomery Clift in Lonelyhearts . Dolores just phoned . " This is Junior , ' " she said . " I 'm going East for personal appearances . Should I look like myself or like an actress ? " " Like an actress who looks like herself , " I said , " Come on up .  | She was leaving so quickly she had no time to buy clothes , or to have all her own in readiness ; we had to lend her some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glamorous clothes : slim skirts , jackets , blouses ? interchangeable . We used only three colors : black , beige and white , and I gave her a chart of what shoes , bags , etc. to wear with each combination , so when she 's in a hurry she wo n't have to think . Like everyone else on the lot , I wanted this girl to make it . She 's as friendly and trusting as a kitten ; she 's not on like many actresses , she 's ambitious , but she has such a quick curiosity about life that acting is n't the end and all . The first day she came to the Clinic , we talked about animals . Like myself , Dolores loves anything that crawls , jumps , flies or walks on four legs . I mentioned the homed toads I 'd played with when I was a little girl . The next day I received a present ? a homed toad in a little cage . I 've been given some handsome gifts in my time , but never a horned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The toad is at present residing at Rex Ellsworth 's ranch , close enough to Khaled , the famous stallion , to enjoy the same flies . The qualities so beguiling about the girl are her eagerness , her healthy , young look , and the absence of star complex . In a year she changed from a schoolgirl to a graceful young woman , and clothes helped give her some of this new assurance . Before Dolores , as before all young actresses , I hold up the image of my very favorite guinea pig ? Grace Kelly . Grace has a look I love . There is no pretense in her make-up or her clothes ; she never dressed to attract attention ; she never dressed  | like an actress ; she dressed like Grace Kelly , and she was Grace Kelly ? which did n't keep her from becoming varied characters on screen . In two of the four pictures Grace Kelly and I worked in together , I was able to translate her from the high-fashion model of Rear Window to the drab , chill housewife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of sweaters and housedresses as she certainly did n't want to look like a caricature of " Little Eva . " The dress had to look as if she 'd worn it a long time , as if she 'd lost a great deal of weight , and so on . We found , finally , a shapeiiess wraparound housedress and a sweater that had been in stock for years ; we put them through a washing machine , " aged " them , and called Bill I lolden in for a masculine reaction . Ile assured us Grace looked not in the least Grace . She felt very definitely that without this physical change to help her , it would have been most difficult to play the part . Usually , she played the charming , well-bred cultured person she is , a girl who has traveled all her life , who has known money all her life , and is used to good clothes . I litchcock had told me I 'd have a field day , that the girl had the model look , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't prepared . She came up the stairs briskly that first day , looking like a girl just out of Bryn Mawr ? the whitest of white gloves , the whitest of blouses , the gray tailored suit , the tailored hat , the most immaculate scrubbed look ! We 're used to a certain amount of careless dressing in Hollywood ; nothing about  | Grace was careless . Even better than the clothes was the quiet , shy , interested manner ; she becomes articulate and gay as she gets to know you , and hers is a childlike ability to be pleased . In the pale , frothy negligee of Rear Window , she positively giggled at her image in the mirrors . " Why , I look like a peach parfait , " she said . " Call the girls in ; let them see ! " We were both delighted with the suit of Celadon-green raw silk with its straight box jacket , its wide neckline and tight hip . The suit was the one Hitchcock had first seen in his mind 's eye , colorwise ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an elegance all her own ; the white gloves are a trade mark , so is the smooth hair . She looks that way even after sleeping all night on a plane . I met her at the airport when she arrived in France for To Catch a Thief . I 'd gone over earlier to do clothes for the French members of the cast ; then we were on location on the Riviera for six weeks . But first we had a few days in Paris . We bought bags and shoes ( typically French ) to go with her clothes in the picture ; we hunted for a French bathing suit ( after seeing the bikinis , we settled for an American suit ) . I got to know Grace in Paris . We went to the tennis matches ( anyone who thinks her reserved has never gone with her to watch tennis ) ; we went shopping at Hermes , where she bought presents for every member of her family ? gloves . We went to the theater ; we ate beautiful food and drank beautiful wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitchcock is a great gourmet .  | Later , back in America , Grace had a party for Alfred and Alma Hitchcock and served all the delicacies he 'd liked best . " This is what you ate at the Plaza Athenee ! And this is what you ate at . . . " Grace never was THE ACTRESS ; she liked acting , and did it well , but it was just another experience ; she was a girl who believed in life . She loved beauty , loved prettiness , and was n't afraid to tell you so . She was mad about children and carried pictures of her sister 's and her brothers ' children . She was close to her family , and when her mother , aunt and sisters came to the coast , she brought them to all fittings . You know my well-founded dread of relatives ; but the Kelly clan came to observe and appreciate , the way they 'd go to the theater . I actually surprised myself and asked Grace to bring them . When she was on location , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she left here to be married , we had lunch together at Paramount , and she showed me pictures of her prince . You should have seen the look on her face when people dropped by the table to ask when she was coming back . " Coming back ? I 'm going to get married , " she said , like any other girl in love . Show business was part of the past , like school and college . I receive notes from her now , pictures of the children , the other day an enchanting book of old costumes from Switzerland . Before that , a handkerchief from Paris . And I 've sent her children their first little white gloves . She keeps her same girlish delight and enthusiasm , the same rose-colored glasses she was born wearing . Reporters besieged me at the time of the wedding , wanting  | anecdotes about the new Princess of Monaco . " You must know some anecdotes . " " Grace does n't allow anecdotes to happen to her , " I told them . And she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living at the Bel Air Hotel , she loved to bring her sister and have picnics out in our garden , loved to go swimming there completely alone . She could never see that being a professional person entailed the forfeit of privacy . Of the clothes I made Grace , what I liked best was the ice-blue satin dress for the opening of Country Girl . She wired me from Philadelphia that time asking for a dress ; I made it and sent it . Later she wore it when she won her Academy Award . I loved , too , the golden princess dress from To Catch a Thief . It never has seemed strange to me that this girl , with her warmth , her poise and her belief in fairy tales , should come to live one . As I tell the young hopefuls dressing in her image : " You too can become a princess . "  | To LOOK LOVELY , a woman will suffer . She 'll wear a waist cincher that squeezes her , boned bras that dig her , heels that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earrings that pinch , skirts too tight for walking , belts too tight for breathing . No man will do it . Only one thing matters to the gentlemen  | who 've wandered into my Clinic ( some of them at the point of a gun ) - COMFORT . I learned that early from Bing Crosby when we were working on Holiday Inn ; and from that day to this , Bing has held his record as WORLD 'S FASTEST FITTER . He does n't like dressup , he 'd never dream of it unless the script so demanded ; his famous first words are always , " Why do n't we wear a sport coat ? " Let me explain that my job includes complete costume supervision of each picture : man , woman , child and camel . But , unless the picture is a period piece or a comedy , actors usually wear their own wardrobe . So when Bing begs for a sport coat in my fitting room , it 's because he 's trapped on The Road to Morocco or worse , in White Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sister " act ! Bing took one look at the scarves and fans , the jeweled butterfly I was about to stick in his hair , and set his ears back . " You kidding ? " Luckily , Danny , who loves to clown ? who can put a hotwater bottle on his head and make a costume ? immediately seized scarf and fan and began a kicking routine . With him to help and while Bing waggled a golf club ( his favorite prop while fitting ) , we got him rigged up as something that hilariously suggested a chorus girl . What makes Bing the world 's fastest fitter is that he 's strictly a fugitive from masquerade . The best way to trap him is with the co-operation of a Danny Kaye or a Bob Hope . Most of his costumes have been for pictures Bing and Bob  | made together , and Bob runs the interference . For him it 's a pleasure . He adores costume pictures in which he can be sheik , sultan or Spanish dancer , and he lives it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? smirking at the dragon up the back of his Chinese pajamas , rolling his eyes under a turban . The more he reacts , the funnier it gets ; and Bing ca n't resist , like a patient under laughing gas . The contagion spreads throughout the Clinic ; their fittings are as funny as the finished picture . Bob not only reacts to his own clothes , he reacts madly to whatever his leading lady wears . I 've seen him break them up , from Dorothy Lamour to Eva Marie Saint . When Hedy Lamarr appeared for My Favorite Spy in a glittering gown so tight she could n't walk she had to slither , and with and shoulder hared , Bob took a look and stage-whispered : " Who 's going to look at me in this scene ? " I did n't realize how aware Bing was of women 's clothes , however , until he brought me my first toreador shirts from Spain . This was long before I 'd been to Spain or succumbed to the charm of Spanish fashion . Just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very upset one clay . A columnist had named the ten worst dressed women in I lollyw(x)d , and among them , me . The columnist was objecting to my " uniform " : the tailored suits and tailored shirts I 've worn purposely . Bing told me to pay no attention to the columnist and quoted a few choice tidbits the same writer had tossed at him . But when he returned from his trip , he brought me these beautiful toreador shirts , he 'd had them made for me of ruffled white  | broadcloth . " You just wear these with your suits , " he said . Another man extremely observant of what women wear is Cary Grant , and I use him frequently as medical consultant . Cary has lived everywhere ; he has international background ; his taste is impeccable . ( I consider him not only the most beautiful but the most beautifully dressed man in the world . ) When we were making Houseboat , I talked to him about clothes for Martha Hyer who was supposed to live near Washington , D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been all over the world but I never have been to a country club dance with the summer set near Washington . Cary , I knew , had lived there . So I checked him to see if summer cottons would be correct for the dance . They would be , he assured me , and men would not wear dinner clothes , the whole thing is most informal . You can trust Cary Grant . His is a discerning eye , a meticulous sense of detail . When we were making To Catch a Thief , he came up to the Clinic and planned a color scheme for his wardrobe throughout the picture . He found what Grace Kelly was wearing in each scene , then selected clothes to complement hers . " She 's wearing a pale blue bathing suit for the beach scene ? Good , I 'll wear plaid shorts . She 's wearing a gray dress ? How would it be if I wear a dark jacket and gray slacks ? " That he admired the clothes I 'd done for Grace was my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are authoritative on the subject of women 's clothes ? They not only are , they 've taught me  | a great deal by showing me their point of view . Carolyn Jones walks on the set of A Hole in Your Head and Frank Sinatra 's face lights up , he gives me a big wink and sighs , " That 's a gasser ! " Clothes , Sinatra language , are either gassers or nothing , just as the femme who wears them is exciting or not ; and director Frank Capra wanted Carolyn 's wardrobe to be so exciting and Eleanor Parker 's so conservative that the audience would respond to these girls without a word of dialogue . Frank responded . Marlon Brando , on the other hand , does n't notice clothes unless they 're wrong . " I never separate a dress from an actress . I 'm concerned only with the reality she conveys . If the dress is wrong , reality 's lost , " he says . Jerry Lewis , the do-it-yourselfer of the industry , who constantly improvises gag costumes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? this same Jerry , producing his own pictures , keeps an eagle and very serious eye on his leading lady 's clothes . " If you are playing a scene with a girl who is supposed to be sweet , simple and sympathetic , and she 1(x)ks like a witch in clothes too tight , too low and too siren ? no matter how good an actress is , you feel a psychological barrier . You ca n't think of her as a grown-up Girl Scout , " Jerry says . " If this is true in comedy , how much more true in serious drama , and how much more true in real life . What a woman wears creates , subconsciously , your idea of what she is . In every scene I 'm aware , as an actor , of the impact the actress is making on me and at the same time I 'm aware , as a producer , of what the audience is going to think . " Then Jerry really floored me.  | He said , " You know , I 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show me sketches you 're not competing with either the sketches or with the actress . It 's damned smart . " I had no idea this Jerry was so observant . Yul Brynner and I talk endlessly on the psychology of clothes ; over lunch in the commissary , day after day , when he 's here , we match verbal swords . Yul thinks most clothes are too " self-conscious " ? they overpower the actress ; they interfere with audience perception . That 's why men are often more effective than women on screen , he says . Men 's clothes are simpler , the audience can concentrate on their characterizations . In The Buccaneer , for example , he felt that Claire Bloom in her ordinary pirate clothes was far more dramatic than she or Inger Stevens in their jeweled ball gowns . It is something for a designer to think about , for a doctor to put into practice . Every woman , and certainly every designer , needs the masculine reaction . Most men are , clotheswise , conservative , a trifle old-fashioned ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a girl 's waist , he does n't want to feel a corset . If he puts his arm across her shoulders , he does n't want to confuse her with a football hero . They do n't like lampshade tunics , exaggerated peplums , hobbleskirts , trick necklines or gadgets . They dislike clothes cut too low , too short or that are too attention-getting . They like provocative clothes , but they do n't want that provocation handed them on a silver platter . They like glamour in fabric or in design but  | not both . They love women in black . They like suits , but loathe those that look like female versions of their own They object to clothes which are obviously young or obviously sophisticated . In a situation where Clark Gable is torn between two women , his divorced wife ( Lilli Palmer ) and his secretary ( Carroll Baker ) , producers Bill Perlberg and George Seaton insist we avoid any great contrast in clothes . They do n't want Lilli dressed to telegraph the point that she 's more urbane or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why tip their hand storywise ? Good clothes have no age . Above all , clothes should be comfortable . Men always want women to look as if they were comfortable and at case . The six men with whom I 've worked who have influenced me most are : Alfred Hitchcock , George Stevens , I IaI Wallis , William Wyler , George Cukor and Cecil B. de Mille . These skilled specialists in the art of picture making are clinical to the nth degree , and they 've taught me many things . First and foremost : in designing clothes for women there is one thing to keep in mind ? MEN ! " The trouble with most designers , " says I Ial Wallis , " they think only of what women will like . The very dress that may delight women in the audience may appall every man . " Hitchcock thinks in teuus of color ; every costume is indicated when he sends me the script . For Grace Kelly in Rear Window he wanted especially a " pale green suit " ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in gold . There is always a story reason behind his thinking , an effort to characterize . He 's absolutely definite in his visual approach ,  | and gives you an exciting concept of the importance of color . When he signed Vera Miles , he asked me to study her . " She 's an extraordinarily good actress , but she does n't dress in a way that gives her the distinction her acting warrants , " he said . I saw what he meant . When you walked in a room and saw Vera you thought , " A pretty , pretty girl , " not " Who is she ? " " She 's not outstanding , " Hitchcock said , " because she uses too much color . She 's swamped by color . I think the reason I was impressed with her to begin with was that I saw her in black and white on television . " So we reduced Vera to black and white photography . I did a complete personal wardrobe for her when she was first presented in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of wearing any other colors , in black , white and gray she feels right , as I do in black , white or beige . People are forever telling me I should wear red . In red I feel like a lost fire engine . Hitchcock 's color sense rubs off ! George Stevens has no preconceived ideas about color . He leaves it to me to go through the script and illustrate it as if it were a book . A Place in the Sun or Shane is first worked out in terms of illustration before it begins to move around on the set . He wants realism , not prettiness . He was impressed with the beautiful Elizabeth Taylor rich-girl wardrobe for A Place in the Sun ; but he was crazy about the funny clothes we found for Shelley Winters by going to bargainbasement sales . Hal Wallis is the toughest . All clothes for his pictures must  | be understated . He does n't want to be conscious of clothes . He wants nothing to interfere with telling the story . " But Hal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good ; save it for the next fashion show ! " Whether we 're conveying the stark realism of a Shirley Booth , the dramatic characterization of a Katharine Hepburn , the clowning mood of a Jerry Lewis comedy , the offbeat tempo of an Elvis Presley picture ? story comes first to Hall Wallis . Nothing must clutter the point of view . When Willie Wyler makes a black and-white picture , he wants only black-and-white sketches ( we usually do all sketches in color ) . Ile is completely the realist . Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday had to look like an everyday girl in the streets of Rome , not like the princess she was . Olivia de Havilland in The Heiress had to look as if no human being would marry her except for her money , in an era when almost every dress was beautiful . There can be no fudging , no extra hint of softening . He wants no model sketch either , but a sketch that looks exactly like what he 's going to see on screen , with the figure drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer sketches an elongated , stylized dream of a figure : tall , long-legged , tiny-waisted , slim-hipped ? a willowy clotheshorse . Willie wants none of that . If the actress is short and broad , draw her short and broad , and the dress as it will fit . He wants real women walking around in his mind 's eye , and on his screen . So does George Cukor . Most sensitive to clothes , he works closely with a designer , even comes to fittings . Cukor 's in-  | fluence on me dates back to pictures like Camille which I admired from an enormous distance . His is the theater point of view and he has a phobia against anything the least hackneyed . " Do n't start digging out a flock of cowboy outfits , " he told me as we contemplated a western with Sophia Loren . " This is a dramatic picture in a western atmosphere , let 's not make it look like a TV serial ! " He hates formula , he wo n't tolerate an actress emerging like a stereotype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every detail and details count . De Mille is master of the super production , a perfectionist on the encyclopedic detail demanded by his plunges into history . When you do the headdress for Nefertiri , you 'd better be prepared to quote volume and page to verify that this will match the replica found in the Egyptian queen 's very tomb . He never shows enthusiasm . No " Wonderful ! " No " Beautiful ! " No " Good , Edith ! " Once I said to him , " Mr. de Mille , in all these years we 've worked together , you 've never told me a costume was good . The most you say is , That will do . ' " He almost smiled . " If I say it will do , it 's good ! " De Mille wants color sketches always ; he has a color print made of the sketch and blows it up giant-size , to compare with the finished costume when you finally show it . If the original sketch had seven pearls on the shoulder strap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thigh , be quite certain the finished costume is identical . For the ending of Samson and Delilah , the temple scene , I sketched Hedy Lamarr in peacock blues and  | greens with a long flowing cape to suggest the bird . " Why not use real peacock feathers ? " asked Mr. de Mille . " Make a whole dress of peacock feathers . " " They 're almost impossible to get , " I said . " No peacock feathers ? " " I tried not long ago to get some for a Lamour turban , " I said . " But even if we could get the feathers , I think it would be almost impossible to make a dress of them . My mistake . It was like waving a red flag before a very active bull . " You used to teach school , did n't you , Edith ? Well now , you 've heard of a durbar ? " " Is n't that the ceremonial in which the rulers of India receive visitors of state ? " " It is , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused a sensation . On page so and so of such a such a book you will find a picture of Lady Curzon 's dress . It was made entirely ? of peacock feathers ! If they could do it then , we can do it now . I 'll supply the feathers , " he said . A few days later , a station wagon filled with plumage arrived , M. de Mille at the wheel . " I have a ranch , " he explained . " We raise peacocks . I just spent the week end picking up fallen feathers . " So , I designed and we made a magnificent dress that transformed Hedy into the most exotic of birds . Mr. de Mille was so proud of it he took it home when the picture ended . ( I might also add that the picture brought me an Academy Award , toward which the peacock dress probably contributed  | no little . ) From Mr. de Mille you learn the importance of accuracy and absolute authenticity . Charlton Heston , on the other hand , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , so goes our running gag . It started when he came up to Surgery just before The Greatest Show on Earth . He arrived while I was working on a sketch , painting in sequins , and strings of sequins were draped over the drawing board . " Are those spangles ? " he asked . " Academically , no . Those are sequins , also known as paillettes . " " Will I wear them ? " " You will not . " " Why ? Is there any reason why I ca n't wear sequins ? " " Well-uh , yes , " I said . I , who hate people who start sentences with Well-uh or But-uh . . . " You are n't playing a trapeze performer . " " Cornel Wilde gets sequins ? " " He 's an acrobat . " Each time Charlton came up for his fittings , he 'd see glittering trappings for everyone else in the picture . " Everyone in the circus wears glitter but me ? " he 'd say . " Yes . The only man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the scenes . " He looked quite downcast ! Now , I 'm sure Charlton Heston would n't be caught dead in sequins ; but he heckled me constantly , to no avail . He did n't get sequins in The Ten Cornmandrnents or in The Buccaneer or any of his pictures , and he  | continues to plague me . When my husband and I were visiting in Rome during the filming of Ben Hur , we were sitting at lunch with Willie Wyler , Audrey Hepburn and an assortment of international press representatives , when Charlton joined us . " Where are my sequins ? " he said . " Are n't you wearing them in Ben Mir ? " I asked sweetly , Ben Hur not being our picture and my responsibility nil . I 've stood my ground for at least half a dozen pictures with this persuasive man . If someday you see him bound onto the screen shimmering , you 'll know I 've lost the pleasant battle . If all this sounds as if 1 enjoy working with gentlemen patients , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when Danny Kaye arrives and completely disrupts the place . " Where 're my sketches ? Where 's food ? Why are n't things being done ? " he 'll yell , bounding up the stairs a good three weeks before sketches are due or himself expected . And there he stands , leaning against the door , a sartorial hodgepodge in duck pants , nature-boy shoes , silly golf hat and magnificent alpaca sweater ( he has a handsome collection of sweaters and likes them appreciated ) . " This is terrible , no one cares ! " he moans while we dissolve in mock sorrow . He loves huge sandwiches , cookies , Cokes ; these necessities appear immediately because everyone on the staff loves Danny , he can do no wrong . And he 's genuinely interested in costume . When we 're at the deciding stage , he 's dead serious . It goes like this . Say we 're working on costumes for The  | Five Pennies , the story of Red Nichols . We have the place set up like an art gallery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweeds and cashmeres , rich fabrics a man with means would wear . Red Nichols started out poor , but became a successful man , and since the period of the picture is the 20 's and 30 's , today 's clothes wo n't do . Danny arrives with director , Mel Shavelson , producer Jack Rose , the cameraman , art director , color consultant , etc. , and they march around the room studying each sketch and fabric seriously . Shavelson and Rose are more interested in how an actor looks than in how an actress looks . In Houseboat they were perfectly willing to stretch a point and have Sophia wear clothes more glamorous than she would have worn applying for a job as housekeeper , because it made her entrance so funny . But in this instance , what Danny wears influences his interpretation and that 's important . Danny leads the parade around the room , his hands deep in his pockets , dead pan , dead silence , studying each sketch , each fabric seriously , intently , not a word ? not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined each thing with care , he sits down . We all sit down , and wait . Does he like what we 've done ? Does n't he ? Then suddenly .. . " Edith , " Danny says , " why do women wear girdles ? " The place falls apart . That 's Danny again . But when we get that matter settled , he is ready to discuss seriously what he 's going to wear as Red Nichols to show the transition of time , age , locale and financial position . On the screen , the character ca n't say , " I 'm ten years older now and have money ! "  | You prove it by clothes and attitude . Danny discusses and we decide on each costume for each scene of the picture . There 's not a trace of zanyness , it would be in the way . Once we 've decided , he explodes . " Food ! " he yells . " Food , food , food ! " A few minutes later , beaming happily , he 's sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pace that makes him so funny , and funny is what this man is , in spite of the fact that he is basically a handsome man ( who works hard at not being a handsome man ) . In The Court Jester , in tights , black velvet doublet and plumes he could have looked magnificent . Only his acting saved him . In Me and the Colonel only his mustache saved him . Like my other male patients , although he 's very concerned about authenticity and characterization , his chief concern is comfort . The nearest he and I ever came to a struggle was when The Court Jester called for a suit of armor . " A nice comfortable suit of armor ? " Danny said . I must have looked dubious . I know some tricks but they do n't include comfortable armor . " Let 's drop the picture , " Danny said and meant it . Director-producers Panama and Frank looked at me in despair . It was up to me ; and finally , with the help of modem science , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum . Even so , he hated it . Just as Tony Perkins hated his tight , narrow-shouldered suit for The Matchmaker . He 'd try on the jackets with their tight collars , their small-town gawky look ; we 'd button them  | up , he 'd expand his chest . Pop ! Finally , to get Tony before the cameras for this period piece , I had to make his clothes look tight without their actually being too tight . So far as fashion goes , the men have one word for it ? COMFORT . i  | HOLLYWOOD IS NOT necessarily the greatest fashion center of the world , but motion pictures being the largest means of mass communication , fashions seen on the screen have an enormous effect . From the time I was a trembling intern , never sure of my next operation , fan letters have been coming  | in : movie fans admired a certain dress , wanted a pattern . I could n't send a pattern , but I did send little sketches . The minute Dorothy Lamour hit the screen in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow with the Latin American trend started in The Lady Eve . Women 's Wear Daily reproduced adaptations of the guayavera ( Mexican shirt ) , the poncho , the serape styles , and identified them as " Edith Head designs . " Other fans wrote in for the pattern of a certain wedding dress ; others wrote wanting to know how to look better , more glamorous . I have always observed people . From that first trip to Europe , I 've spent every cent and all my leisure traveling and SEEING how women look everywhere . If Billy Wilder says , " You know those women in Soho . . . " I do know . If producers Carlo Ponti and Marcello Girosi talk of Italian widows in mourning ? The Black Orchid ? I know the kind of women of whom they speak . If Delbert Mann is discussing Rita Hayworth 's clothes for a small hotel on the seacoast of England . . . But I also observe people here in America . I visit supermarkets and Sears Roebuck stores , watch women in bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , at laundromats and at first nights . I 'm getting ideas for the actresses I must transform into character , yes ; but also , I 'm dying to tap women on the shoulder , nice-looking women , overdressed or dowdy women who should be told , " Mrs. Average American , you could look lovely . Even on a limited budget , you do n't have to look middle-aged or negative . Now , what you should wear is this .... "  | In January 1945 I suddenly , surprisingly , got my chance . Art Linkletter started a new radio program . The audience was composed of everyday women , not chi-chi fashion-conscious women , but homemakers accustomed to doing their own housework and raising their own children ; and Linkletter invited a guest expert on each program ? Perc Westmore to tell them about make-up ; an expert on figure control ; a family relations counsellor . Would I come on , discuss clothes , walk through the audience and actually tell women what was wrong with the way they looked ? Would I ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women , any size . As for snap judgments , I 've made them daily . This was my chance to turn America into a country of neat and natty women , women with assurance , women who knew they looked right . The next thing I knew , a microphone was in front of my face , Art Linkletter had me by the arm and we were walking down the aisle through a crowded auditorium . At least Art was walking , he practically carried me . Something about that bit of metal on a cord corrupted all the muscles I 'd once built at the YWCA . " This is Edith head of Paramount , she 's trained to help the stars dress beautifully , perhaps she can help you , " Art said smoothly . " Just stand and ask your questions . Ah , this lady in the fifteenth row . . . " She stood up . " Is my dress right ? " she said . I eyed her wildly . Silence on radio is dead air , I had to talk and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiara : flowered dress , flowered hat , fancy shoes , fancy gloves and tons of jewelry . I said :  | " This lady 's wearing a light blue dress with yellow figures , a flowered hat . . . " " One minute , " whispered producer John Guedel , following us with a clock . " Because you 're slender , you can wear the flowered dress , but a simpler hat , simpler jewelry , simpler gloves , simpler shoes , simpler bag , simpler ? simpler . . . " " Twenty seconds , " whispered Guedel . " Well , Edith , you think she needs fewer accessories , " said Art . Heaven knows what I said ! Without Linkletter , I 'd never have lived through those first programs . In my panic I talked so fast I was unintelligible . But the women wanted help ; most of them hated the way they looked , or their husbands hated it , or their children or their friends . Help them I must . After a while , I became very sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be gay . " Oh , lady , less accessories ! " I 'd say , or " To tell you the truth , your hips are too big ! " Sometimes our sponsor was a trifle startled . But the women were good sports , no one ever got angry , and in seven years on the air I began to be a cross between Beatrice Fairfax and Emily Post . It was a very " family " program , the patients seemed to enjoy telling me their problems . I was deluged with mail off the air and considered myself quite a wit on . Then ? September 1952 ? the program went on television . Talk about learning a lesson ! That I was neither  | young nor beautiful I was well aware ; but now a camera was my adversary and I was as paralyzed as a prize fighter by the first punch . When the bell clanged and we took to the air , I would n't " fight , " I tried to hide behind Art Linkletter . Letters poured in criticizing my clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark glasses . And it was true , I wore dark glasses ? because , subconsciously , I did n't want people to think I needed to wear glasses at all ; I wanted them to think I was wearing sun glasses . " If you 're blind , get a tin cup , " one letter said . " If not , take ' em off . " Finally , I grew so worried I asked to see a kinescope of the show , and I nearly died of mortification ! Vlore than my worst fears , worse than in Lucy Gallant ? there I was looking a little like a big-eyed bug . I was standing wrong , cringing as if I expected Link to hit me over the head . I seriously considered giving up the whole thing . But the program offered me valuable xesearch , and was carrying information to millions of women identifying themselves with our guinea pigs in search of glamour . Did I say millions ? Fight and a half millions to be exact , a greater audience than I had ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond them , women who lived in such remote spots they seldom saw a movie ? were out there asking us on the I , inklctter show for help . I stayed on . And if I was telling others , why not let them tell me ? I dropped the dark glasses for the lightest tint that would still let me see under the lights . Every few weeks since September ' 52 , I 've faced the world ; and , like a surgeon operating in a giant clinic , I 've become so absorbed with  | what is happening that I 've gradually relaxed about myself . One thing I learned early ? there is no such thing as a woman who is perfectly satisfied with herself . On screen you have the Magnanis who say , " I am Magnani , I do not wish to change , " but in the everyday world almost every woman wants to look different . Not only that ? it matters to her vitally . And why should n't they change ? It is n't too difficult . Very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures that could n't be helped with the correct lines . Everyone does n't have to look like a designer 's dream . I say sacrifice style any day for becomingness , for the look that is attractive to you . The majority of women on the Linkletter show have as their weak point a figure defect which they reveal rather than conceal : overweight women , for example , in sleeveless dresses . " Your upper arms are n't slim , " I say . " Would n't it be better to cover them ? " " Well , but it 's so hot ! " And they laugh , sheepishly . Other women have on too much of everything . They evidently feel that if they are not terribly well dressed , putting on lots of added accessories will help . If one pin is good , four are better . One half hour before the show , Art Linkletter asks the women in the audience to write their questions on cards . The cards are brought to me , and out of the sixty or seventy I select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-section . I try to avoid the totally individual  | problem , and we avoid men , although I did answer one cowboy from Montana who wanted to know what to do about bowlegs ! Of them all , through the years , there are several women I remember vividly ... I am dumpy all over one card said . My friends are very critical . This is the third time I 've come to your program , I thought you could help me . Dumpy , the card said . . . . When I finally saw her , I went into a state of shock . How to do this and not hurt her ? In such a fragment of time ? Dumpy she certainly was ? short , thick and broad in the beam ( about 5 ' 3 , weight around 150 ) , short necked , heavy armed . And dull ! She was wearing a mousy colored spring dress , chosen to look inconspicuous , a utilitarian dress , three inches too long ? evidently to make her appear taller ? and pulled in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plump arms were bare , the neck covered . " What is your name ? " Art Linkletter was saying . " Please try to speak a little louder . Just a little louder . . . . " She represented absolutely the way 1 'd dress an actress to make her look unattractive and heavy on the screen . She 'd made herself into such a nondescript , subdued creature she could hardly speak above a whisper . " What can I do ? " she whispered . " I ca n't get any thinner , I 've tried . I 'd like to look better . Even my husband does n't like the way I look . "  | " You could look slimmer wearing a darker color , " I said gently but firmly . " I do n't mean black ? it 's summer ; but something darker ? blue , or charcoal with white accents ; and not a wide belt , a narrow belt the same color as your dress . You 'd find any two-piece dress more flattering . And wear sleeves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important thing about you . You have a very pretty , round friendly face . " She blushed and giggled . " May I try something ? " And I quickly unfastened the top two buttons of her dress and turned the neckline down into a V. I took my own scarf , draped it over her plump bare arms , took off her wide belt and lifted her skirt a good three inches . The effect was magic , the audience applauded . Now you could see her pretty face and neck , you could see her nice feet and ankles ; the lower neckline cut the thick look of shoulders and bust . She looked incredibly younger ! " The long skirts make you look older , so do the high necks , " I told her . " If you wear dark , simple dresses , and frame your face with collars and becoming necklines . . . " All simple , ordinary suggestions she might have culled from any magazine or newspaper . But people do n't quite know how to use the information that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so drab , so nothing , " she said , forgetting the mike , forgetting Art Linkletter , talking to me as if I were a doctor . When the program was over she came backstage and I made her some thumbnail sketches : necklines , collars , hats .  | I never saw this woman again , but a month later she sent me snapshots . " Even my husband notices the change ! " she wrote on the back of one snapshot , and she looked very happy . It must take a lot of courage to get up like that before eight million viewers ; it takes courage for me , and I 'm a professional ; but they come , these women . . . . A crippled teen-age girl , in leg braces , leaning on canes and murmuring : " Do you think I should dress so people wo n't notice me ? " " You should dress exactly as though you had nothing wrong with you . You 're a very pretty girl . Let 's pretend you 're a star . With your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My folks think I should wear dark doilies , plain clothes . " " I say your eyes are your most important feature , and blue should be your most becoming color . Wear it . " . . . A young woman in a wheelchair who said casually , " Clothes mean a lot to me , I want to know how I should look from the waist up . " We talked about hats and necklines . . . . A tall , handsome woman , very long-waisted , who feels she needs high heels , but with high heels is as tall as her husband . I told her when she is with her husband to wear lower heels if that makes him feel more comfortable , and to wear high heels when she 's with her women friends and style is more important . Every woman owes it to her husband or escort to dress in a way that will make him feel comfortable . . . . A charming , dignified woman of thirty-five , probably president of her P.T.A. , whose husband makes fun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants . There  | are plenty of costumes less revealing than Capri pants , and I think it unwise to have ridicule , especially from one 's husband . .. . A young woman with a baby in arms who said , " I have an awful problem , the baby keeps grabbing at my hat . He knocks it off all the time . " I suggested she not wear the hat . And did that boomerang ! At once came letters from milliners insisting I was taking the bread out of their mouths . ... A woman , sixty , who wants to look younger because her mother , eighty , looks as young as she does . She was pretty tired of the whole thing , everyone thinking her mother was her sister . What she had on ? navy blue dress , white sweater , small white hat ? would have been suitable for a woman of any age , twenty-five to fifty-five . Trying to dress younger would not make her appear younger . " Why not get Mother to dress older ? " suggested Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recently we had a contest where several women were given thirty hats , scarves , flowers , jewelry and three minutes to select their accessories . Then I was to tell them right or wrong . We have fashion shows ; we talk about clothes ; women are selected at random , given a small amount of shopping money ; we discuss how they should dress ? then they return and I analyze their clothes ' selection . Or we pick two or three women who are n't happy with themselves ; they come to the studio and let me supervise their dressing ; we show them on the pro-  | gram before and after . Most of them ca n't believe it ? ca n't believe that the changed creatures are themselves ! And the " miraculous changes " are simple , really ; in many cases , just the matter of not dressing tailored all over or fancy all over . Eye-catchers are important , but a figured dress , a fancy hat , fancy jewelry and fancy shoes are too much . Always , after the show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal more ground than we were able to cover in the few minutes on camera . I explain that the first point of emphasis is shopping . They are inclined to buy impulsively , without relation to things they already have , and they are frequently influenced by what another woman wears . You ca n't be influenced by anyone , certainly not by the salesgirl ( who wants to make a sale ) or by the dear friend ( who does n't want to hurt your feelings ) . Most of these same women are good executives in the way they do their food marketing ; they plan ahead , they co-ordinate their purchases and see that nothing goes to waste . Now to do the same thing in fashion terms . If they 've already bought wrong , they are helpless in changing it . Sometimes I can help there , too . During World War II , I did countless advice articles , for materials were scarce and clothes had to be made do . Dresses worn under the arm or in the sleeves can have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts can be cut down to make a blouse ; necklines can be squared . Suit jackets showing wear can be made into sleeveless cardigans . A jacket can be shortened to bolero length and worn with a gay sash  | made from an old dress . There are endless tricks . In 1947 , one sweep of the designer 's pencil outmoded nearly everything in every wardrobe . Women were rebellious , frantic , or both . The Hollywood extra who usually provides her own clothes was as hard hit as the Main Street housewife . At Paramount we remade 600 evening dresses , 400 day dresses , 450 suits , converting them to the new style look for dress extras . For many a bit player , we transform a star 's dinner gown into a handsome negligee or cocktail dress . First aid is something we 're just naturally prepared to do for clothes ; and the average woman with a budget problem could help herself immeasurably clotheswise by learning how to sew . There are endless ways to doctor dresses , and if you can begin from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create wonders . Select a pattern ; identify yourself with a pattern . In the last few years I 've done several designs for the Advance Pattern Company . I 'm not allowed to do it commercially ; the money goes to charity . I do it because I 've found that the Linkletter women wanted patterns ! Many people wonder why we make everything worn on screen , buy nothing ready-made . For Rock-a-Bye Baby , Jerry Lewis suggested that leading lady Connie Stevens just go out to the store and buy something to wear . He did n't want her to have fancy clothes ; she was a small-town girl . When we showed Jerry the results of our shopping , he cried , " Make ' em ! " Ready-made clothes are made to fit anyone and each individual has figure differences . In making your own clothes ,  | you can adjust to those figure differences , play up your good points , see that the waist fits at the waist , the shoulders are exactly the right width , the darts in the right place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? " . " Would it be better to put plain buttons on this dress ? " . Will the current fad last ? " . . . " Should I wear it ? " . . . The questions backstage at the Linkletter show are simple , but the effect is unlimited . Did I once dream of turning l lollywo od into a place of sleek , beautifully tailored women with the greyhound look ? Today I dream bigger . Better than " elegant " to me is APPROPRIATE . The message 1 ' 111 trying to convey on the air is : Look right for the time and place . The cardinal sin is not being badly dressed , but wearing the right thing in the wrong place . There is a point every woman can learn from the actress . Do your clothes justice ? never appear in them half-baked , be the finished product . An actress does n't wear a dress or suit and say , " This 'll look wonderful when I have the right shoes and the right hat . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's always being seen . She takes pride in herself . So should we all . " Oh yeh ! " some of you are probably saying . " It 's easy to talk . " But I do n't just talk , I experiment . And not always on actresses or on the Linkletter show . My very favorite guinea pig happens to be ? me.  | WHEN I BECAME head designer at Paramount and went to Paris to take on the aura of the haute couture , I sailed with one determination , to change myself completely . I never had liked the way I looked : my hair , my face , my whole rather frightened , bespectacled self ; here was my chance to  | try the magic on me and return a new woman ? Madame Edith Head . First , I went to the great hair stylist , Guillaume , and put my head in his hands . It was a short-cropped head , something like Colleen Moore 's Dutch flapper bob , and it was n't important enough for Guillaume . It fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully and turned it into a pineapple ? bangs swept up , back and sides swept back and up . I believe he called it a coxcomb effect . I could n't see it too well myself , having just abandoned glasses for a lorgnette . Then I went to the collections . At Schiaharelli 's , I ran into Edward Everett I Lorton and his mother , and we sat enchanted with the tall , sleek models in their tall , sleek clothes . ( If ever there was a designer who catered to height it was Schiaparelli ! ) Mrs. Horton knew what she wanted : a red dress . She found it and ordered it . I did n't know what I wanted ; I 'd already purchased suits and tailored clothes ; now I wanted the Madame Edith dress . It appeared , finally , on a model at least six feet tall ( it should have stayed on her ) , a black dinner suit embroidered in pink and yellow sequins with long lemon-colored gloves worn to the shoulder . This was for me , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cost me another fortune going through Customs ; but it was worth every cent . I arrived home , locked myself in , tried on the new gown , the new hair-do and the lorgnette ? and never to this day has anyone else ever seen " Madame Edith " ! If the effect was awful the experience was most salu-  | brious and taught me a lasting lesson . The creature who faced me in the mirror was not me . I hung the dress away in the closet ( it 's still there ) , put on my glasses , combed my own hair and decided who I was . Not that you can have only one style . Let me refute that idea quickly . Style is just as important for you as it is for your home , your car , and so on . I experiment . I do n't say , " I can wear only beige suits with white collars " ( my favorite ) ; I follow fashion . I could n't expect my distinguished clientele to pay me much heed if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes is terrific ; they are the best nerve medicine in the world ; why not use them ? I experimented . I 'm not a bad guinea pig , either . I 'm just over five feet , I could n't be accused of being a greyhound , but that is no reason for being negative . I do n't look like anyone else . Why should I ? That was a mistake that held me back for a long time : trying to look like other people . Then , about twelve years ago , I began concentrating on me and evolved a style of my own . Colors overpowered me , prints overpowered me , so , be monotone . Every woman has at least two personalities . As a dress designer I allow myself several . At work , to be background , I wear the tailored suits , the softly tailored dresses , usually in monotone colors . ( Right now , in spring , I 'm wearing three suits , all the same style : one in linen , one in tweed , one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one short , one medium , all in shades of pale wheat . I might add that even though these suits are tailored , they are high fashion , and they achieve  | what I want : individuality . ) For great occasions , I wear very extreme evening clothes ? my favorite , at the moment , a white embroidered cotton ( the material came from Switzerland ) with a flared skirt slim at the top and very full at the bottom , and a short jacket bordered in black sable . At home I dress in a casual fashion ( usually white or natural homespun ) . At the moment I 'm having made a series of off-white skirts with unpressed pleats , interchangeable tops with pushup sleeves and varied necklines . On a Saturday morning at Casa Ladera ( the house on the side of the hill ) , you 'd probably find me playing with my cats or gardening in the patio in a pair of white peon pants and a boxy jacket of the same stuff . One thing for sure , at hone no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because I do n't particularly like career women : I think they can be treacherous animals to live with ; they often take their careers too big ? the working part of their lives eclipses their private lives . I 've designed wedding finery for many a lovely romance that did n't last , perhaps because the women were too competitive , because they were so submerged in their careers and the competition involved . It 's very tiring to be with people who are unremittingly competitive . These girls are very successful careerwise , but they 're no longer married ; they forgot to turn off business when they came home . Other competent career women are successful at work and in marriage , but they could n't be married to Bill ( Wiard ) Ihnen . No one could be an executive at home and be married to Bill .  | And that 's the man to whom I 'm married . He was born in this country , but he lived in Europe a great deal , and he has the European point of view about being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view , and I not only respect it , I like it . Wiard Ihnen came to Paramount about the same time I did ( no one could pronounce his name so we all called him " Bill " ) . We grew up together on the lot , and occasionally worked together on pictures ( as an Art Director , Bill has two Oscars of his own ) . We became close friends from the time we worked on The Cradle Song , lunched together , and were completely compatible . If he forgot to ask me at lunch , he 'd often phone me later : he was taking some girl to the opera that night , what flowers should he send ? Or he was taking someone to a concert , and she was wearing a red dress , what kind of corsage should he send ? I did n't tell him that I personally do n't wear corsages , that unless a dress is specifically designed to demand a corsage , it 's a superfluous ornament . Carry flowers , yes ? use a sprig of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're the Grace Kelly type , a rose in your hair . I did n't give Bill a dissertation , I just told him what to send . I always liked him . He is a great artist and has great taste , extraordinary taste ( except in corsages ) . Then one time his good friend , Victor Calderon , came on a visit from Spain and the night he arrived we all had cocktails together .  | " You two have been going together a long time , when are you going to get married ? " Victor asked . " He has n't asked me , " I said . " Tomorrow , " Bill said . " Fine , I 'll arrange everything . " And Victor raised his glass To the Ihnens . " We 'll pick you up tomorrow morning . " I had no idea whether he was serious or not . I did not don bridal finery . As a matter of fact , I put on a hot red-and-yellow hand-woven dress and a big straw sombrero . That certainly looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest purple orchid in the world ; and my feeling for floral decor notwithstanding , I promptly pinned it to my hot red and yellow bosom . Evidently we were getting married . We drove to the airport , and Victor and Bill ushered me to a tiny chartered plane , the smallest plane I 'd ever seen , and introduced me to the pilot . I 'm afraid of BIG planes ! This one held four people neatly packed , but the pilot asked if he might bring along his girl friend and we did n't have the heart to say no . Somehow the little plane was airborne and headed east . The pilot radioed ahead to have a taxi meet us and we trundled into Las Vegas . Then he dropped us off at the Golden Nugget while he went to see about getting us a judge . I could n't resist the sounds of jingling coin . I got some silver dollars , advanced on the roulette wheel and put a silver dollar on number four . " You do n't put your money on a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . " At that moment number four came in  | and paid thirty-five dollars . Bill could n't stand it , he walked away ? because this time I put all thirty-five dollars on four . It worked just fine . I 'd never won a dollar in my life before or since , but I could n't lose that day , and it was quite a pile by the time the pilot and his girl friend came back to say they 'd found a judge . This was September 8 , 1940 . I must confess that we did not live " happy ever after . " Our first year of wedded bliss was somewhat impeded by two complete sets of furniture . I was living on Doheny Drive at the time , in a house full of dainty French provincial furniture ; it looked , really , a little like a French house of ill repute . Bill had a house on Sunset Plaza filled with authentic Mexican and Spanish furniture . When he was a very young architect , he read a book called The Bible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " Mecca . " He fell in love with Spain , actually , and in return trips collected many wonderful things . We bought our first house and moved in to it all my dainty French furniture and all Bill 's massive Spanish . The two languages did n't mix . We were both totally stubborn . Our possessions were highly stylized , we loved them , we were n't about to give . After a year , the message finally came through to me that Bill was the architect and I was the dressmaker . Very quietly , I got rid of all my furniture except that in my bedroom . It is still French provincial , the covering of my French daybed red-and-white toile de Jouy . And of course it was Bill who found our present home and talked me into it : a Spanish Colonial house , California  | style . ( If that sounds complicated , it is . Bill says that when New England sea captains came down to Mexico and California to get hides , they brought along shiploads of doors , windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballast and barter and introduced into Spanish architecture the double hung windows and paneled doors of New England . ) In any event , the place was charming , Bill told me ; it had walls four feet thick , a galeria , and , sweeping up behind the galeria , a mountainside covered with greenery . He 'd fallen completely in love with it . " When you see it , E'dith , do n't obviously like it too much , " he said . " I 've already gone overboard and the agents and the owner know it . Of course if you do n't like it , we 'll just forget it . " With that he tucked me in the car and we rushed right over . It looked like an authentic Mexican hacienda to me , a little austere ( it was n't landscaped then , as Bill later landscaped it ) ; and the man who had built it years before had loved heavy substantial construction , had been meticulous about every detail that contributed to his comfort , including a steam bath ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres of land , a forty-square-loot steam bath , no closets . I objected loudly . Bill had said , " Do n't be too enthusiastic " ? I objected , too , to the huge arch in the living room ; I did n't like the baronial fireplace , and the steps leading to the breezeway were trimmed in blue tile . Blue is not my favorite color , I 'm the lime-yellow type . We went back home . " Well , that 's that , " Bill said . " I guess it was too big , any-  | way ; there 'd have been a lot of work ; I 've begun to hate it myself . " He looked very grave , one finger rubbed across his black mustache . ( He has a very fierce mustache . ) " But Bill , that 's what you told me to do ! " " You mean you liked the house ? " " Yes , it 's a lovely house , it 's just that I do n't like blue tile and there are n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You overacted . Let 's buy it . " And a gleam came into his eye . " I 'll remake it . " Before the day was over , we 'd bought it . I traded in my chic sophisticated French housecoats for the homespun that goes with Casa Ladera . Not that I wander around looking like a Mexican refugee . I never wear pure Mexican , I do derivations ; and I 'm enough of a ham actress to know that Bill , in selecting the type of architecture , the structure and massiveness he liked , also gave me the most flattering background I could possibly have . I feel I look as if I might have been born on the place . He built me a dressing room any movie star would envy , a whole room paneled from top to bottom in drawers . He has also built another wing to the house , plenty of closets , and some of the most magnificent furniture I 've ever seen ; and we 've had a wonderful time collecting the Mexican tin masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wall of the cantina is covered with Mexican hats , there are hanging copper pots in the open kitchen at the far end of the patio , and fresh flowers before the small shrines . ) Best of all is the atmosphere of peace and ease , and not the least in establishing this atmosphere , Nannie , who has kept house  | for me for twenty-one years . This is another world , where studio problems do n't exist . They should n't exist . I learned long ago to block out and bury things I do n't like , things that hurt . I have in my mind a special room with iron doors . The things I do n't like I throw in there and slam the iron door . Occasionally , when I do bring a problem home , Bill and I talk it out . He knows the studio , he worked there for years ; we speak the same language . He 's practising architecture now and painting , something he 's always wanted to do . He knows how to use time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , playing tennis , doing things around the house we both love . And of course , caring for the cats . They are Miguel and Minerva ( Spanish for Mickey and Minnie Mouse ) , brother and sister , and hate each other with an unparalleled hate . We even feed them separately ; we pretend there 's only one cat at a time . I love animals as I did when I was a child . Bill laughs at me , carrying caterpillars out of the house and putting them back in the earth , or warning him away when the snails come out on the ivy in the evening : " Do n't step on him , Bill , he has an important date over there on that geranium . " Bill likes to garden , I love to cook . My mother was an excellent international cook , I still use her recipes ; and when we travel , I bring back new specialties , dishes we 've eaten and liked ; I record them automatically in this funny photographic head of mine , with what goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clams from Italy , and salade Nicoise from the south of France ; from Spain a cold vegetable soup , gazpacho.  | Cooking was my " category " on the Groucho Marx show . ( That surprised them ! ) And how I boned for that " exam " ! I knew the questions would be erudite , so I memorized The Gourmet Cookbook ( in toto ) , some Mexican and French cookbooks , etc . I went through wines and sauces . Then I hit the show . Question I : " What is a Kentucky Wonder ? " That was easy : a bean . I waited for the double-cross . " What is the name of a famous breakfast dish served in Philadelphia made of pork and meal fried together ? " Easy : Scrapple . Question Three : " What are crepes Suzette ? " Easy . The French pancakes . Then the jackpot question : " What famous statue is among the seven wonders of the world ? " That was the Colossus of Rhodes . I won , of course , two thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week I spent memorizing cookbooks . I should have taken baseball as a subject . If I ever go on again ( and I wo n't ) , I 'll take my favorite sport . I never knew about baseball until we made Rhubarb , the story of a cat who inherited a baseball team . As a lover of cats , even ornery ones , I felt it my duty to investigate the sport to which he was addicted , and I 've been a mad fan ever since . Oh , those Milwaukee Braves ! I 'm probably the one dress doctor in town who can identify a fungo fly . The designing business takes you into strange fields . Remember for a long time I thought of ducking the whole issue and returning to schoolteaching ? Well , when I did go back to teaching , the subject was " Motion Picture Costume De-  | sign , " the school was UCLA , and the students were Marines , soldiers and sailors on the G.I. Bill . I thought they were accredited students and could draw . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin-up girls . It was a great case of mistaken identity . I 'd taught school twenty years ago when teachers were teachers and students students . Progressive methods have evidently changed all that , because they did not treat me like a venerable professor . But like a venerable professor I am treated in many unexpected places . Two years ago , when Bill and I arrived in Germany on vacation , Paramount International mentioned we were coming and it took us three hours to get out of the airport . In addition to radio and news reporters and photographers , there was a young newspaperwoman who sat me down to design a blouse " suitable for all German women . " That is covering quite a lot of territory : the shorts , the tails , the fats , the thins . I sat down and designed a wraparound blouse . . . . In Holland , I found myself facing 350 Dutch women who had assembled to find out what they should wear , and I tried to tell them via an interpreter . . . . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were buying ingredients for sukiyaki . A Japanese mother who could not speak English had her daughter ask , Was n't I from the Linkletter show ? And should Japanese-American women wear American clothes or Japanese clothes here in America ? I suggested : " American clothes for street wear , but by all means keep your lovely kimonos for home wear . They 're beautiful , they suit you and you love them . "  | In a motor court at Nogales last Christmas vacation , we came out of our room to find a delegation from Oklahoma ? mother , father , aunts , grandma and a very heavy teen-age girl . Was n't I the lady from the Linkletter show ? What was wrong with the way this girl looked ? While Bill packed the car , I suggested that instead of a plaid skirt , she try a solid dark color ; instead of the bright , tight sweater , a flannel blouse . . . . In Gila Bend , when we stopped for a beer at a little roadside restaurant , we leaned our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer , and glanced at the newspaper . The front page described the wedding of THE BRIDE OF THE YEAR , a Gila Bend girl in a white satin gown with " the famous Sabrina neckline . " On this trip through the desert , incidentally , we stopped at a small store ; I bought Christmas ornaments , and , out in the middle of nowhere , decorated a little greasewood tree . For the moment , time slipped away ; so did the world of fashion , and I remembered a long-ago pigtailed girl toying with bits of greasewood under the desert sun . If a burro had shown up , I 'd probably have taken off my own silk scarf and resumed business as usual .  | OBVIOUSLY , THIS Is a far more complex subject than can be dealt with in three quick minutes on television . Clothes have to do with happiness , with poise , with how you feel . You never forget the dress or suit in which you looked well , felt right , and lived wonderful moments ? the " Alice Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downbeat in her Country Girl sweater , the clothes depressed her . Anna Magnani felt slovenly and miserable in her sack slip . From Charles Laughton to Yul Brynner , costume has helped immeasurably with every role an actor has to play . Why would n't they ? Clothes are the way you present yourself to the world ; they affect the way the world feels and thinks about you ; subconsciously they affect the way you feel and think about yourself . If you are not appropriately dressed , you lose the essential importance of all grooming ? you lose the feeling of being comfortable and feeling assured . And for every moment of a woman 's life , within her home , with her family , in business if she 's a professional person , feeling comfortable and assured are exactly what she needs to feel . It spells the difference between poise and inferiority complex . That correct clothes are much needed therapy I 've come to realize from the hundreds of letters that pour onto my desk weekly , from women across America who are deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both are available . Every woman , like every actress , is capable of being visually translated into many different women . A woman in a bathtub has little personality , she 's just a woman without clothes . Clothes not only can make the woman ? they can make her serveral different women . There 's no one style , there 's a style for a mood : a tailored woman at work , a siren at night , a feminine , attractive creature at luncheon , an ef-  | ficient chairman of a P.T.A . meeting . Working wives must cultivate two separate fashion philosophies : no man wants a brisk , executive-looking woman at the dinner table , and no man wants a too-alluring creature gliding around his office . I remember a picture in which Irene Dunne played a rich woman with a great feeling about women 's place in the world , international affairs , and such . She needed to look beautiful and intelligent . " I do n't want to look like a businesswoman , " Irene said . " But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " I put her in dark silk with white at wrist and throat , lovely millinery . Recently , at a fashion show , I ran into Irene , now a delegate to the United Nations . She was wearing a dark silk dress , the most feminine white hat I 'd ever seen , white gloves and pearls . She looked exactly like a woman a man would talk to . Good clothes are not a matter of good luck . They are a result of thorough knowledge of the person you are dressing : her measurements , her coloring and facial contours ; and , even more important , what makes her tick . Clothes counterbalance personality , play it up or play it down . Each woman 's task is to be a do-it-yourself dress doctor , and the person she must know is herself . The questions to ask are : WHO AM I ? . . . WHAT DO I WANT TO CONVEY ? sTEr 1 : Let 's analyze your figure . At the studio , I put an actress into a skin-tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her figure . This gives me an exact picture  | of her figure , its faults and good points , what should be emphasized , what minimized . At home , stand before a full-length mirror in either a bathing suit or your briefest underwear . Look at yourself from the neck down and force yourself to be objective . With a tape measure , measure your three major figure points : bust , waist , hips . Stand against the door , mark your height . ( Height and measurements ? not weight ? determine your clothes figure . ) Or , tape a large piece of wrapping paper against the wall . Mark your height on it , and your outline , and you 'll have an actual figure to look at . Figures do n't lie . SHORT ? TALL ? FAT ? THIN ? AVERAGE ? WELL PROPORTIONED ? These are the facts you must face before you decide what to do with yourself . You can be smart and attractive no matter what the figure : the trick is to know your figure and select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camouflage whatever the problems are . So let us look at a few popular problems : TOO HEAVY ? First rule for you : Do n't fit your clothes too tightly . The tighter the fit , the more apparent the bulk . Wear darker colors , not always black or navy , but dark , medium tones rather than pastels or very bright colors . Be careful of prints and patterns . Prints should be small designs against a darker background ; polka dots should be very small , stripes vertical ,  | and the fabrics you choose should have dull surfaces , not shiny . These specific suggestions will help you make the least of yourself : NECKLINE : V , open shirt collar , or narrow square . BUSTLINE : Slight fullness over the heavy bust is good camouflage . So are narrow revers or collars on a V neckline . Narrow , vertical tucks arc good to minimize width , too ; and avoid glittery or eye-catching fastenings , large buttons , pins , brooches or long necklaces . SHOULDERS : Keep them smooth : no padding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a narrow belt same color as your dress , preferably of same fabric , with a fabric-covered buckle . ARMS : Uncovered are dangerous when you 're plump . Your most flattering sleeve length is below the elbow . Hips : Wear your skirts hanging loosely from the waist and do n't let them cup below the hips . Your skirt can be straight , gored or pleated . Avoid the gathered skirt , it 's treacherous , so are full petticoats . LEGS : Wear medium dark hose and plain footwear . Fancy shoes just call attention to too-heavy legs . If you have dainty legs and feet , which many heavy women do , be as gay as you wish . SILHOUETTE : Your most flattering silhouette is any version of the two-piece garment : suit , or dress and jacket . The twopiece look is flattering because the loose jacket hides heaviness through the middle . An overblouse is another good bet . If  | you want a one-piece dress , choose one that opens down the front with a fold or piping to emphasize this line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Let them fit easily and be simple in cut . Avoid big collar and cuffs , avoid heavy revers , avoid too-bulky fabric . If color contrast with your dress is wanted , wear your dress in the darker shade , your coat in the lighter . If your coat is less than full length it must be of the same color value as your dress . FURS : The short-haired furs are your best friends . ( This includes mink ! ) In a stole , select short-haired fur in the darker shades , straighter lines . Fur scarves ( four , five or six-skin ) are very becoming to you . In selecting a fur coat , avoid anything shorter than hip length . Full length is preferable . Furtrimmed coats are attractive , especially when fur is used in tuxedo fronts or in narrow collars . ACCESSORIES : Most heavy women have pretty faces , pretty throats , chests , wrists and hands . Concentrate on them . Use interesting collars , scarves and jewelry . If you have pretty wrists , use cuffs and bracelets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bulky ) and in necklaces avoid chokers and select a graceful medium length . Hats are where you can really go to town ! Your face is your fortune ? Frame it . TOO THIN ? Can you imagine slenderness being a problem ? From the fashion point of view , of course it is n't . However , there are danger areas . The woman who is slim is likely to have too  | small a bust , too thin legs , neck , arms and shoulders . First rule for those of you who are too thin : Do n't fit your clothes too tightly . The tighter the , fit , the more glaring the fault . You do n't want to look bony . The darker the color , the thinner you 'll look . You can wear bright colors and pastels , and white and bold patterns ; you can wear any fabric that you wish . To make the most of yourself watch . . . NECKLINE : High necks are safest but you can use a lower neckline by filling it with soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , try sheer yokes the color of your dress or yokes of nude net . Try wide , flat costume jewelry or several strands of pearls to cover collarbones. 11ortunately , the covered-up look is very smart , and you do n't have to feel you 're concealing anything . BUSTLINE : In selecting a padded bra , be careful to select one in proportion to your frame , a large bust on a slender chassis can look grotesque . If you do n't care to use padding for the fuller look ( and I very seldom do in pictures ) , use fabric fullness , gathers or soft pleats . Loosely fitted blousetops arc good , too . Lighter material than that used below the waist will make you look larger , so will patterned fabric . WAIST : Thank your lucky stars and accentuate it with wide belts , contrasting colors , cummerbunds , sashes and interesting buckles . ARMS : Cover them with full ( not tight ) sleeves . Cuffs add interest and flattery at the wrist ; they 're excellent bone concealers.  | nips : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) wear gathers , pleats or peplums . LEGS : Light hose , preferably seamless , will become you best . And do not wear shoes that contrast too greatly with the color of your hose . Keeping leg and foot close in color value reduces the chance of your legs ' looking too thin . Full skirts help too . SILHOUETTE : YOU can wear the most extreme styles : tight waists , full skirts and petticoats , the draped , the sheath , the tunic , the peplum , the shirtmaker dress and any version of the two-piece dress . If you like sweaters and are very thin , try twin sweaters , undersweater plus cardigan , and possibly a scarf . COATS : Select what you will ? slim , wraparound , voluminous or belted , flat or bulky material in any color . FURS : Stoles can be any size , any color , short- or long-haired . Coats can be any length from bolero down . Fur-trimmed coats as extreme as you wish . ACCESSORIES : Wear costume jewelry so long as it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Hats should not be too high-crowned or narrow-brimmed . Veiling is flattering . TOO TALL ? This , again , is hardly a problem fashionwise . It 's really up to you ? do you want to accentuate or minimize your height ? Obviously if you wish to look shorter , do n't wear high heels . There are smart heels in medium heights as well as flats . A  | two-tone color scheme is important . Try a light top and a dark bottom or vice versa , using the light color where you are more slender , the dark color where you are too heavy . ( If you are a tall woman and heavy , you 'll want to combine these formulas with formulas for the heavy woman . ) If you wish to minimize your height watch these danger areas : BUSTLINE : Do not emphasize . SHOULDERS : Do not pad . WAIST : Emphasize your normal waistline with a color-break ? a belt as wide as you wish if your waist is small . ARMS : No very short sleeves ; preferable length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hers : Flared skirts , softly pleated or gored skirts minimize height . LEGS : Do n't wear your skirts too short ; keep them in relation to your leg . SILHOUETTE : The two-piece height-breaker is your best choice : skirt and jacket , skirt and overskirt , skirt and tunic or peplum . Full skirts and wide belts are good . Jackets are good ; they can be any length . COATS : Hip length or three-quarter length is preferable ; belted coats are very good . Flared coats are very good . Try a contrasting color in your coat , try extreme collars and cuffs . FURS : Stoles , scarves and jackets are good height-breakers . Wear what you wish , long or short hair . In fur coats , you can wear any length ; hip length or three-quarter length are good . On a fur-trimmed coat , avoid the tuxedo front , but fur cuffs , pockets or collars are fine .  | ACCESSORIES : Medium or broad-brimmed hats are good for you , so are flat crowns . Use hats for color contrast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your whim ; you have the height to carry even the bulkiest . TOO SHORT ? The first principle for the small woman is the use of one color . Never cut the body line , keep your lines vertical , your prints small , your heels high ( except with sports clothes or slacks ) , and , unless you 're under twenty , keep away from the too , too little-girl look . There 's no reason why you ca n't achieve glamour and sophistication in clothes ; just be careful they do n't overpower you . First principle in designing for a star is never to let the dress overwhelm the personality . This goes for you , too , and one way to insure it is not to call attention to bust , waist or hips . NECKLINE : Very best , the V. The open shirt collar is good too . BUSTLINE : Minimize your bustline to avoid looking topheavy . If you are large-busted , wear no extra ornamentation , no glitter jewelry or buttons in this area . SHOULDERS : No fullness at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omit belts or use narrow belts , self-color or fabric , no heavy pockets , no horizontal trim . ARMS : Slim sleeves . SILHOUETTE : Avoid too-long dress length ; choose a length that is right in relation to your leg . The slim look is the most  | rewarding for you ; eschew voluminous skirts and petticoats , avoid tunics and peplums . Keep it simple . COATS : The straight coat is best . Avoid the flared coat with heavy collars and cuffs , avoid big buttons and big pockets , avoid bulky fabric . FURS : Wear them , but keep the furs small , short-haired , small-collared . Be very careful of the fur-trimmed coat ? it should have very small collar , narrow revers down the front , small cuffs . ACCESSORIES : Hats , bags , jewelry ? all should be small , to scale . In the matter of shoes , indulge your little feet . Mrs. Alfred Hitchcock is a very chic example of what clothes can do for the short woman . She has an excellent figure , in perfect proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her passport , and when she walks into a store to buy clothes she 's very likely to be shown something suitable for a twelve-yearold girl . Size 8 's are seldom sophisticated , and most size 8 's do n't have to be presented to the Queen of England . Alma Hitchcock , traveling constantly with her famous husband , must look smart and sophisticated ; she has the wardrobe problems of a diplomat 's wife , and she dare not look too glamorous ? the clothes would overpower her . She must be patient , and when she buys clothes ready-made have them scaled down . Her well-dressed look is based on wearing slim one-piece clothes ( she could look dumpy if her clothes were cut in too many places ) and on not breaking the line with color or wide belts . She wears jackets , but they match the dress and ,  | short or long , they 're very slim . Of course , she carries herself tall , with a confidence , a poise and a charm that makes her seem considerably taller . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life how she wanted to look ; and she 's worked out her format . ) ' t sTEP IS : Prepare to go shopping . Each of us can do what Alma Hitchcock has done . Each can look better if ? she 'll take the time to analyze her figure , the trouble to choose the right clothes for that figure and have them properly fitted . Before you go shopping at all , get the right underpinnings . There are few perfect figures . The money you spend on corrective undergarments is the most important money you  | spend . You 're interested in the masculine point of view ? I wish you could be with me when a producer calls to say : " Edith , the clothes are fine . Before we test them , will you please get that actress into a bra and girdle ? " Then I go to her and say : " Do n't you think it would be better for the test if you wore a bra and girdle ? " " I never wear them ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If she 's Anna Magnani or Shirley Booth playing a sloppy woman , then it does n't matter . If she 's trying for glamour , then , thanks to the producer , she ends up correctly sheathed . By all means , when you go out to shop for clothes , wear the right girdle , the right bra and the right shoes . Never shop simply because you have " nothing to do . " Never buy anything as a whim . In short . . . STEP III : Make clothes a business . Make up your mind what you need . Seasons overlap , and you ca n't generalize . You have to ask yourself how abrupt the seasons are , how different , and whether or not you can afford them . The young actresses who come to me for help usually bring along all the clothes they have . We lay them out around the room and decide which can go on into spring ( or fall ) , what accessories will go with what ( we make a list of accessories which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what basic clothes they need . You do n't buy one dress , or one pair of shoes or one hat unrelated to the rest of your clothes . You plan for a span of time , just as you plan food menus and shop for  | staples . Then make a " grocery list " and know exactly what you 're looking for . This will keep you from squandering your budget on haphazard accessories or a cute hat that matches nothing . Be sure that any item you purchase ? from a pair of gloves to a winter coat ? helps to give the impression you want to give , will serve you on a number of occasions and be friendly with other items in your wardrobe . We ca n't all live in penthouses or winter in Florida . What you buy must suit your income and environment . And do n't let anyone tell you that what you have to spend is n't important . It is . The young starlets with their limited budgets would be quite mad to go out and buy white fox capes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifty dollars . They must buy a simple dress that looks elegant , and have enough left for the accessories that dress it up or down . You can buy wonderful clothes inexpensively . Marlene Dietrich was so enchanted with the little six-dollar box jackets she found on Spring Street that she brought one back for every girl in the department . She brought back some charming inexpensive hats , too . The economic problem is a pressing one , not because clothes are n't available , but because a great many women who have homes to care for , a number of children and a limited budget do n't have the time to spend on self-grooming . The first article I ever did on clothes was for Redbook , and I did it in the grand manner , with starlets in lovely clothes showing how to look well-groomed and well-dressed while going through the day 's routine at home . I was pretty unrealistic  | about the whole thing , and the readers let me know it . " Miss Head evidently does n't keep house " . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " and so on and on . sTEP Iv : Going shopping . I 'm a realist now , and I know that time is a frantic thing for the homemaker without help , and for the working wife , and for the career girl . I can only say , time is an urgent problem of mine , too . The more urgent the time , the more important to make that shopping time count . Having analyzed your figure and your budget , you can give the salesgirl a cue . " I 'm broad-hipped . I do n't want a full skirt . I do want a two-piece dress for afternoon wear , and let 's keep it dark . Also let 's keep it inexpensive . " Know what you want ; when you try it on , be objective . Most of the women I have seen who needed help the most looked as if they had bought their clothes without ever glancing in a mirror . If it were possible to have a Polaroid camera along , snap your own picture and develop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't a camera , train your eye . Look at the costume on you , not on someone else . How it looked in the style show at lunch does n't matter unless your measurements and type resemble the model . Be sure that the length is right for your height . I never go to extremes on dress length . ( In pictures , I ca n't . It takes some six months or longer from the time clothes are designed until the picture is released . ) I wear my own skirts twelve to fourteen inches off the floor come hell or high waistlines . It 's the best proportion for my height and my legs .  | Do n't buy what is the " last word " or very high-style , or anything bizarre or unusual , if you have to wear your clothes for the next year . Nothing is deader than last year 's high style . Do n't buy clothes that do not belong in your life : suit your shopping to your activities . Buy as many separates or two-piece costumes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or woman on a budget and will never go out of style . Look at newspaper ads and magazine ads . Identify yourself with illustrations that resemble you , and look for the type of clothes that seem to become them ( we 'll talk more about the LOOK you want later ) . sTEP v : Do n't worry about your age . If you feel dowdy , you 'll certainly look it . If you feel elderly , you 'll look that . The almost universal desire of American women is to look YOUNGER . I stress " American , " because European women are . not similarly concerned ; the youth fetish is strictly our national anthem . In most women 's minds , being young is synonymous with being attractive , romantic , glamorous , having a good figure ? all the things that make a teen-ager long to grow up . " Middle age " signifies the exact reverse . Even some actresses show a mounting tension as they approach the dividing line . It depends , actually , on how good an actress is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth does n't have the same desperate emphasis . The fact is that many of the most attractive , most glam-  | orous women in the world are not young . They have , rather , a sure knowledge of themselves ; they are poised , beautiful and adjusted to life ; they do n't remotely suggest Whistler 's Mother . Ethel Barrymore looks like a queen , Dietrich and Swanson have become all-time symbols of glamour . Some " men are middle-aged at thirty , some are not middle-aged at sixty . And so far as clothes go ? today 's American clothes have a young look , they 're adaptable to fifteen or fifty-five . It 's no longer a matter of age , it 's a matter of figure . I know a number of women forty-five who look twenty-five . And they do n't achieve this look by wearing girlish clothes ( ruffles , pinafores ) , but by wearing clothes that are ageless : the shirtmaker dress , the sweater and skirt , the suit , the simple dress with crisp collar , sports clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older person look older . The point is not how old or how young clothes are , but how well they suit you . Divorce yourself from styles that do not suit you , even though your soul yearns for them . The objective is to make you look glamorous , and by glam- ' our we mean : accentuate the positive ; eliminate the negative .  | ONCE YOU HAVE bought your clothes , be kind to them , take them to the right places . A sun suit may look fine in the sun , but it looks dreadful indeed at the supermarket . You seldom see a badly dressed woman at a sports event . High . heeled satin pumps and tennis shorts went out with Clara  | Bow , and women who go to golf meets or football games , or who play sports actively themselves , usually look pretty well . And you seldom see a badly dressed salesgirl . Each store has regulations ; salespeople help set up standards of good taste . The danger zones are in the area of too casual public dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-collar jobs . I do n't believe in a hundred rules . They dull a woman 's native creativity . Half the fun of being a woman is to experiment with the way you look ; but work hours are not the time to decide between Circe and Eloise . Evening is the time . For fun at a party , you can plan whether you want to try for the seductive look ( long earrings , sheer black stockings , extreme hairdo ) or whether you want the feminine , chiffonorgandy look . There is no such thing as a healthy woman over the age of five who does n't enjoy experiment . I can remember my mother at seventy-six , about to go out with friends , saying , " Now tonight I 'm going to try so and so , " as excited as a girl . This is wonderful ; it 's fun ; it 's part of femininity , the same quirk that wo n't let any of us pass a mirror without looking . But you can also look too anything ? too Theda Bara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never look as if you were going to a costume ball when you 're not . You can translate yourself into many women , but not every woman . The same chassis seldom adapts equally to femme fatale and dewy-eyed ingenue . Experiment , for heaven 's sake and your own . Find your type , and assert your individuality ; but let me suggest a few axioms to keep in mind : 1 . Do n't let your clothes be fitted too tightly . Even a perfect figure looks better if it does n't resemble a sausage . Figure exaggeration that stresses anatomy to the whistle point is hardly good taste ; it 's a holdover , really , from an era when glamour was confused with sex . Only bathing suits should " fit tight . " 2 . Do n't wear a date dress when you 're arriving for a day 's work at the office . The dressy dress , the low-necked lacy blouse , the glitter sweater , all of the glitter category belong to after-dark . So do the diamond-studded plastic sandals . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carry a large handbag with jewelry , fresh gloves , something for your hair ( tiny veils attached to a comb , a bow or a flower ) ; but do n't look as if you were going to a party during daytime hours . 3 . Try dressing for men instead of for women . It 's less competitive and a lot safer . Things that women may think too , too cute can scare a male ; and the " too , too " look is usually the basis for a woman looking her worst . Men notice a woman first , her clothes second ; they dislike any distortion of figure silhouette deliberately devised to be noticed . Waist , bust and hips must be natural . Fit the dress to the girl , not the girl to the dress . 4 . Do n't flout convention . If you are going to a place where it is correct to wear hat and gloves , wear yours . 5 . Do n't be too different . You do n't want to dress like the herd , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | a yard full of ducks . If your friends are wearing sport clothes to a luncheon , do n't wear an afternoon dress . Being too much an individualist is not being well dressed . 6 . Do n't wear strapless dresses , rompers , sun suits or slacks to go shopping . 7 . Ditto ? to go traveling . If American tourists could hear what the people say all over Europe , Mexico and South America , they 'd try for a more covered-up look and they 'd certainly wear skirts . There are fortunate girls ( usually under the age of fifteen ) who look well in tight trousers ; but I have seen so many bulging bottoms in Capri pants , shorts , levis and jeans that I 've grown positively to dislike the whole trouser family ? in public . 8 . Do n't feel that when you are going to a party you must look " dressed up " ? a simple dress is safer if there 's a question of what to wear , and you will be much more comfortable simply dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " smartness . " If your dress is noticed before you , it is not a successful dress . It should be a part of you . " Oh what a stunning dress " is no compliment . " How stunning you look " is. 10 . Do n't be afraid to wear a becoming costume many , many times . It 's an old-fashioned idea that you must have a new dress for every occasion or party . Even if you have the money to do so , it is n't necessary . The modern approach is to change accessories .  | Which brings us to what ACCESSORIES can do for your clothes and you . They can achieve a more youthful or a more sophisticated effect , a sport look , a feminine look . Accessories determine the formality of the average dress or suit , furnish the all important eye-appeal . Be kind to your clothes . You would n't put mayonnaise on angel-food cake ; do n't wear evening jewelry on a tennis dress . Here is what you can do with accessories . Take a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose you want to look as young as possible . . . . With the addition of white collar and cuffs , possibly a tie or a bow ( if it 's a suit , add a white blouse ) plus a simple , brimmed hat , plus short gloves , plain pumps , a box bag , you have a costume that is youthful without being deliberately girlish . The same dress or suit can become a sport outfit by using a beret or sport hat , plus a sport scarf or ascot ( with the suit , a sport blouse ) , a sport belt , pull-on sport gloves , spectator sport shoes and a pouch bag . Your look is now tailored and casual . Want to look feminine ? Try the same dress with a feminine hat , large or small-brimmed to suit your face and height , trimmed with flowers , ribbons , feathers or veiling . Add a soft chiffon scarf caught up at the neck with pin or flower ( with the suit add a frilly blouse ) , plus crushed gloves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminine . Want to feel sophisticated ? Use jewelry on your collarless dress . ( With a suit , open the top of the jacket and fill in with jewelry . ) Add a dinner or cocktail hat , matching  | gloves and shoes . Drape yourself in a fur stole ; if you ca n't afford fur there are many handsome synthetics . There you have an evening glamour look ! It is n't so much a question of what clothes you have , it 's what you do with them . It 's a question , too , of COLOR . Color is the greatest accessory . The young look can happen with a vivid bow and hat . The sport outfit can use a bright beret and blouse , or a gay , striped , figured or plain scarf . The palest of pink , blue , pastel or white makes gloves , blouse and hat more feminine . For sophistication , we usually avoid bright color and concentrate on one color with one accent : black with only pearls to spike it , light with dark gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actress more than the style of dress or suit she wears . I used to think that when Mae West said , " No green , Honey , " or Barbara Stanwyck , " I hate brown , " they were being temperamental . There has been so much more research today on color psychology that we know colors affect people physically , emotionally and mentally . A woman should wear colors that make her feel happy , colors that do something for her , colors that make her feel young . No one should wear colors she does n't like . Incidentally , you do n't have to wear one color . A young woman wishing to emphasize youth may wear an entire outfit of pink . A more mature woman might wear that same pastel color in her accessories ? bag , hat , scarf , to pick up her darker suit . Color is the most personal point of all fashion . You should  | either get help or work out for yourself what is right for you . Black and white are flexible , they can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay or somber , black can be stimulating or dreary , so I do n't include them in this color chart ? a chart based on mood and key , in no way scientific , but to date highly successful in my practice . Table In the past , blondes always wore pastels , brunettes always wore strong colors and redheads never dared touch red or purple . That changed during World War I and never did come back . Redheads use color carefully today only because their own coloring is so flamboyant . Arlene Dahl , Rhonda Fleming , Tina Louise and Susan Hayward with their beauty and their figures must not look too theatrical . You dress them with emphasis on their coloring in pinks ( remember when no  | redhead would dream of wearing it ? ) , mauve and green . Color can be your friend or foe , one of your very strongest allies in changing your type , enhancing your good points . Yet most people fear it . " I ca n't wear gray , " they 'll say ? which is ridiculous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or they say smugly , " I always wear blue . " If you do , you probably look dull . Worst of all is to go overboard on color . Such as when , with a black dress , the woman wears a magenta hat , magenta shoes , magenta gloves , magenta jewelry and a magenta bag . Color should n't be repeated more than twice . Dabs of color give an appearance of busyness . It would be better to choose only a magenta hat and keep all other accessories to the color of the dress itself . It is n't those who spend the most money who are the most smartly dressed . It 's those who spend the most time and thought . If , when you go out , you know that your cotume is smart and that you 're neatly and securely put together , if you do not feel it necessary to hike your girdle , adjust your straps , pull your stocking seams straight ; you have physical and mental poise . You can wear your clothes with grace and pride ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crux of the matter : the FORMAT . Any woman out of her teens knows whether she is gay or quiet , the feminine or the athletic type . The question is , What do you want to do about that type ? emphasize it or change it ? Some things arc not possible . If you 're the Kate Smith woman , you ca n't look like Jean Simmons . If
