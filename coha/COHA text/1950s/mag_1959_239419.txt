The Astronauts <P> Sir : <P> Re your article concerning the seven chosen for the first manned space flight - April 20 : the essay about Marine Lieut . Colonel John Herschel Glenn Jr . was stupendous ! Like we sing in the Marine Corps Hymn : <P> If the Army and the Navy Ever look on Heaven 's scenes They will find the streets are guarded By United States Marines . <P> <P> ( A CPL ) DON L. CARVER U.S.M.C. Kaneohe , Hawaii <P> Sir : <P> I can only wish the Astronauts failure in their race to space until would-be warmakers are treated with solicitude in their padded sanitariums . The U.S. and Russia should surely be indicted for negligence in their attempts to spread man-made chaos to the cosmos when we have galaxies of human problems to solve here on earth . <P> <P> WESLEY H. LONG <P> Ann Arbor , Mich . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I wish you had included pictures of the wives of the seven chosen . <P> <P> MELVA POBER <P> Pittsburgh See cuts . - ED . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From your April 20 description of " The Strange British Mood , " are we to assume that you Americans are ready and anxious to be fried by H-bombs ? <P> Supposing that we had n't been " stripped of ... empire , economically and physically sapped . . . " by wars - in which , may I remind you , you first bled us white with " cash-and-carry " and then joined in largely to protect your investment in our future - are we to understand that you would expect us to be as anxious as the Gadarene swine to plunge to perdition ? <P> <P> STEPHEN BARBER <P> London <P> Sir : <P> The U.S. , France and Germany all pay attention on political matters to military leaders ; we in Britain find this inexplicable . What is disquieting at the moment is that , with the illness of Eisenhower and the resignation of Dulles , the mainspring of Western defense is weakened to such an alarming degree that the political direction could be taken over by these " talkative generals " - no match at all for Top Politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Sir : <P> Nehru 's attitude toward the recent events in Tibet is flagrant contempt for democracy TIME , April 20 . You simply do not possess a true love for democracy and brush aside the mass propulsion of Tibetan people into slavery by casually and apathetically remarking , " We do not wish to aggravate the situation . " There is no need for Communism to force itself into Asia , for with the sympathetic indifference of men such as Nehru , Asia will be Communist without a shot being fired . <P> <P> EDWARD KURDZIEL Cudahy , Wis . <P> <P> Sir : <P> The thought is enough to make one weep . Today , when a courageous little country dares to defy a giant in the name of freedom , the same freedom which the whole free world endlessly chants about , it fights alone . It is a lonely and futile fight indeed that inevitably has to be lost while the rest of the free world stands by and pours torrents upon torrents of sympathetic words . <P> <P> L. S.
