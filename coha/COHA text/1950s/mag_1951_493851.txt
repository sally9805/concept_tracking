NOVEMBER 19 , 1931 DISASTER ON THE KAW the cover , ( Homecoming , Kaw Valley by Thomas ? 1951 ) was made in a special edition for the members of Congress of the United States . It was sent to them October 13 , 1951 , on the eve of the Senate 's review of the flood rehabilitation bill which was passed earlier by the House of Representatives . Its purpose , conceived under the illusion that the Senate might reconsider the House bill , was to add a certain graphic straw 's weight to the arguments of those Senators who , I believed , were already determined to fight for such a reconsideration . It failed to have effect . Too few Senators were willing to put up the kind of a fight which would set the scales of Senatorial opinion where a picture might be useful in any close balancing of votes . The failure of a picture to move or influence people is , in itself , of no consequence . The failure , however , of this particular Congressionally directed Kaw Valley lithograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large consequence to thousands of people . To understand why this is so it will be necessary to glance briefly back at what happened in the Kaw River Valley last July and then at what happened later in the halls of Congress . During June and July the Kaw River Basin was subjected , it will be remembered , to week after week of extraordinarily heavy rain . Up-river farmers and their crops suffered from this but as too much , or too little , rain is a common hazard of the farming business , no great concern was manifested in the towns and cities along the Kaw 's course . Newspapers noted conditions on their back pages but without exciting alarm except possibly among those operatives in the grain and implement businesses who had stakes in farm success . However , when the rain had slapped down the crops and had soaked the land beyond further absorption and the runoff began , the urban folks ? along the Kaw River came to realize that too much rain for the farmer could , be too much rain for them also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Kaw and then the river itself began to overflow and send massive flood walls of mud and water in their direction , they were n't ready . It had not occurred to them to question their situation . Had n't Congress and the Army Engineers spent millions of dollars building levees , current Thomas Hart Benton , a resident of Kansas City , Mo. , has portrayed life in the Midwest in his early cartoons for the Joliet , Ill. , American , his paintings and his murals.blocks and containment basins to protect them from the rivers ? And had n't a solid number of their Senators and Representatives shown , by speeches and votes , that they believed further engineering protection a waste of money ? Was there any sign of uneasiness among the river engineers themselves about too much country water on the upper Kaw and its tributaries ? From Manhattan to Kansas City , every place struck by the July flood was caught unprepared . To the perhaps unavoidable ruin of an unprecedented and catastrophic rainfall was thus added a further ruin which came from misplaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . Owners of business concerns of all sorts who , with a proper sense of the situation or with an early warning about it , could have saved at least a fair part of their investments saw millions of dollars worth of these go down under the flood before they suspected flaws in the river structures that were supposed to protect them . Other comparatively poor people who , confident like their richer brothers , had built their homes close to their work in the bottom lands near the cities where most of the great industrial plants , oil refineries , railroad yards , packing and storing industries were located , found time when the flood barriers broke only to save their skins . These people lost all they possessed . All ! Their houses were smashed , splintered , overturned and uprooted by the swirling mud and water . Their household goods were waterlogged , broken to pieces or carried away or buried in the gluey muck of up-river top soil deposited . In addition to mud and water , there was fire . Business houses and homes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaming oil tanks which had been loosed from their foundations and floated about on the running water . Mile on mile of indescribable wreck was left when the great flood subsided . Thousands of unfortunate men and women who had put all their life earnings into their homes found themselves without anything but debt in the face of an impossible task of reconstruction . When the full nature of this brutal situation was grasped , Congress was called upon for relief . Agencies to assist business operations here and abroad had been willingly set up by Congress . Billions and billions of American tax dollars were dispensed by these . There were plenty of good reasons to justify this and the people , big and little , of the stricken Kaw Valley , gen- 110 erally accepted them . The principle of 1-3Y-supported rehabilitative and revivifying measures was regarded as proper and necessary where the disasters of war , hot and cold , or the fallibilities of business judgment tended to stop or slow up what appeared to be essential business operations . Why should n't the principle be applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid to repair the wrecks of fillacious business judgment , ' so often advanced during the last two decades , be , equally valid when applied to the wrecks following fallacious ( and Congressionally sponsored ? or blocked ) engineering judgments about river controls ? Those who suffered in the path of the overflowing Kaw had paid their share of the taxes , direct and indirect , which permitted Congressional dispensations . They saw a full measure of help as their right . How did Congress respond to this ? It made a good start . On President Truman 's recommendation it promptly appropriated $25 million for relief . A bill sponsored by Rep. Richard Bolling ( 5th District , Mo. ) providing for temporary housing and emergency shelter quickly went through Congress . On August 1 , when subsiding waters had revealed the full extent of devastation and the human suffering entailed , Representative Bolling and Sen. T. C. Hennings Jr . ( D , Mo. ) introduced companion bills in the Senate and the House to establish a system of " grants-in-aid " which would start the ruined valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real recovery . A hearing held on Bolling 's bill in the House Committee on Judiciary immediately developed opposition . Congressional good will ran up against sacrosanct Congressional theories of " dangerous precedent " and was checked . On August 20 , five weeks after the flood , President Truman , after a conference with Congressional leaders presumably favorable to his views , sent a message to Congress urging the appropriation of $400 million for over-all flood rehabilitation . This was to be divided between partial " indemnification loans " and flood insurance . Representative Bolling introduced implementing legislation the same day . Hearings on this were held in a subcommittee of the House Appropriations and then the full committee reported out legislation which provided only for loans . Bolling , knowing through two visits back to the devastated areas about the human situation prevailing , pleaded that loans piled on an already heavily indebted people did not provide genuine relief . This was the Congressional situation when , some 80 days after the flood , I returned from the . East and went down into the stricken areas of greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first impression gathered , traveling through main traffic arteries , was good . NEW REPUBLIC Although the scars of flood and fire were everywhere evident , more evident still was the tremendous amount of indomitable human energy busily reforging the core of a bad piece of luck . I visited a cleaning and dyeing plant which , though out of main currents , had been under 25 feet of water . A faint stench of rot still pervaded the place , but the boilers and machines were in operation and a big sign at the door proclaimed " Business as usual . " I asked the proprietor how much the flood had cost him . " Not so bad , " he said , " only . about $150 thousand . " He was congratulating himself ! Some he knew could n't do so . In the stockyard areas occasional fences were still down , buildings still set awry , but the cattle were corning in from the railroad sidings . Steel workers were changing new girders for flood-twisted old ones as roofs were replaced on scores of buildings whose walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everywhere energetic men were getting the better of their fate . Going , however , from the recovering business arteries over into the miles of side streets where had lived the people whose daily work in the bottom-land industries helped so largely to sustain these arteries , I saw quickly that the Kansas City Star 's brave slogan ? " You Ca n't Down the People of Kansas City " ? needed a considerable measure of qualification . It was true , but it was a damn sight truer for those Kansas Citians who by luck , or smart dealing , had accumulated a little surplus capital or credit at the banks than for those who had not . And over in these side streets of the working people it was plain that the vast majority had not . For the men and women of this majority , however strong their wills ; recovery in terms of " cost what it might " was unthinkable . Down block after desolated block , the muck covered wrecks of their homes . Condemnation signs were tacked to miles of these split and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corners , appeared the ruined enamel of stoves , washing machines , bath tubs and the remains of chairs . couches , beds and children 's playthings . Here and there in the paling autumn sun men and women pecked at mountains of disaster with shingle hatchets and garden shovels . Looking at all this , I knew that without unfettered help a vast number of Kansas Citians , and others too , up and down the Kaw Valley , were down for good . The cost of a comeback was beyond any price , either of money or hard labor , which they could possibly pay without aid . Reading that the Senate was ready to review the bill passed by the House where a new burden of debt was the price of a downed peoples ' relief I said to myself , " The old Missouri painter , George Caleb Bingham , once defeated a candidate for the governorship of Illinois , with a picture ' Order No. 11 ' . Even though his days are over and pictures do n't carry much public meaning or influence any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . It might be a little , help to those who want to defeat this over-cautious bill . " So I made the lithograph and sent a signed impression ? to every Senator and every Representative . The results are known . A large number went into the waste baskets of the Capitol . Those that did n't had , as I 've said , no effect . The Senate passed the House bill without amendment . President Truman , signed the bill on October 24 . He pointed out its inadequacy . Winter is not far off out here . Down in the river valley below my house , and not so far away either , a man and two boys , 10 and 12 years old , are hacking away at the mud-coated and rotted plaster of a four-room house . It is a lucky house . It stands , and it has a roof of sorts . But it is approached through a trench carved in cracked and hardened mud three feet high and it is surrounded by the yet flood-stinking wrecks of other houses which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children besides the boys . At present they live in one basement room . " We got ta get in here before it gets cold , " the man says . They wo n't do it . Nor will thousands like them who face the same kind of imperative .
