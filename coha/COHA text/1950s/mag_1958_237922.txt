The U.S. consumer , who has gone right on buying heavily despite the recession , finally showed some signs of slowing up . The Federal Reserve Board reported last week that March department-store sales failed to live up to expectations . While sales were 1% above a year ago , the board had expected a rise of 6% because of the early Easter . New York stores were up 7% , Minneapolis 6% , Atlanta 4% , but Cleveland , Chicago , St. Louis and Dallas were all down , as much as 3% . Hoping to stir renewed interest . Sears , Roebuck &; Co. announced an average 13% price cut in its spring catalogue , said it was adjusting all prices in its retail stores . <P> Another indication that consumers were growing cautious came from an FRB report that installment buying dipped $435 million in February .

The low state of inventories promised an upward turn in some industries . No one predicted precisely when the buying would start , but there were a few hints . <P> The much-troubled machine-tool industry reported that new orders in February increased 18% over January and 22.5% over December , which was the poorest month since October 1949 . The National Association of Purchasing Agents announced that only 30% of its members reported worsening business conditions v. 45% the month before , while 19% found more business coming in v. 16% in February .

Furthermore , there are indications that even the rapid rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7% say that they have more people on their payroll , 50% indicate they are at least holding their own .
