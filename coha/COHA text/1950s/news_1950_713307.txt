txt Ohio four weeks before Election Day is one of the most bewildering political puzzles ever tackled by the politicians and the dopesters . No one appears to know . or , what is much more unusual , even thinks he knows , the probable outcome . of the most interesting single election con ' test in the whole country . A A Right now . the odds are on Republican Senator Robert A. Taft to win out over his obscure Democratic opponent , Joseph T. Ferguson . State ' Auditor . But when you delve into the guessing you run into such curious anomalies as the following : One leading Democratic politician says . privately , of course , that he thinks Ferguson would win by a large majority if the election were held now , but probably will . lose by Election Day . ? Democratic Gov . Frank J. Lausche , considered the most astute ear-to-the-ground list tener in the state , kept well It away from any " entangle. ments " with ' Ferguson during the earlier stages of the campaign , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a running mate with the auditor who is under orders by his handlers to talk as little as possible . A A k No one is sure yet whether the big registration is due more to Democratic political activity or to Republican . Both parties went to unusual effort to persuade their presumed follow , ers to register . Senator Taft is more than just the candidate of right wing , conservative , business , and farm groups . He is the very symbol of all they believe in . Yet Senator Taft devotes most of his campaigning efforts to factories , mills , and mines . And as a political road show , his campaign troupe is a dud . His real supporters hardly cross the street to hear him . Mr. Ferguson does n't even campaign in any real sense of the word . He keeps quiet . What he does do is hold up funds to pay the surveyors for the projected new superhighway across Ohio , , thus building his reputation as an economizer . His real backers are the unions . But he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks like a business and farmer candidate . What you almost seem to have in Ohio are two candidates really identified with opposite sides on a class issue but avoiding that identification just as much as they possibly can . * The real issue , it would seem to me , is whether economic and political power in the state shall pass out of the hands of the older leaders in the community into the hands of organized labor . To a substantial degree . such a passage of power from one group to another already has taken place . Organized labor is a mighty economic and political power not only in Ohio but throughout the Midwest . Today it probably just about balances the older elements which were dominant a half decade ago . Does the pendulum now go all the way over to labor 's side ; does it stop where it is in any uneasy balance ; or does it start swinging back the other way ' ? That probably is the biggest question involved locally in this Ohio election . Yet you never would know it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stogily for labor votes and Mr. Ferguson 's public appeal is not to organized labor at all , but just to anyone who likes " economy . " Perhaps this explains why no one seems sure of the outcome . Neither candidate has aroused detectable enthusiasm among his real supporters because neither has keyed his campaign to his supporters . Thus there is no visible device to measure the intensity of feeling of the voters toward the issues or toward the candi-. dates . One presumes that most people of property will vote for Senator Taft . One also presumes that most union mem- . ! bers will vote for Mr. Ferguson . But one does n't know . Perhaps there is a " sleeping " vote on both sides . Perhaps many a union man is secretly opposed to more union in politics . Perhaps many a person who normally votes Republican has come to distrust Senator Taft 's foreign-policy views . You can find some hints of both : The one thing certain about this strange Ohio contest ' is that no one in Ohio is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
