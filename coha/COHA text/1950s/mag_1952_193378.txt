Three days after his lightning army coup ( TIME , March 17 ) , Strong Man Fulgencio Batista moved last week from his Camp Columbia headquarters to the presidential palace in downtown Havana . His white linen suit soaked with sweat , his voice hoarse with fatigue , the " Chief of the Revolution " sat at his old presidential desk for the first time in seven years , greeting job seekers , delegations of sugar planters , union leaders and the press . Tired as he was , he grinned a big victor 's smile . <P> Double Talk . " I am a dictator , with the people , " he explained . " My destiny is to carry out revolutions without bloodshed . The only blood that will be spilled will be that of those who oppose us . No one will be persecuted . We ask only cooperation . " Batista charged again that deposed President Carlos Pro had planned to stage a coup of his own in April to make sure that his candidate , Carlos Hevia , would win the June presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said Batista of the ex-President : " He was protecting gangsters . Anarchy and chaos were sweeping the nation . " <P> The percentage of truth in the Strong Man 's charges seemed to make little difference . Seven years of government by President Pro 's Autntico Party had clearly left the average citizen a little cynical about democracy . Few Cubans doubted that administration politicos had taken lavish liberties with the public purse . Last week , egged on by Batista 's hastily reorganized propaganda department , the Havana press reported that men around Pro made off with $30 million from last year 's $300 million budget . Batista men also charged , without documenting the claims , that the President himself had acquired 16 estates and made himself $40 million richer in his 3 years in office . <P> Double Defeat . The only citizens willing to take a stand against the Batista revolt were a small band of students who shut themselves up in the university , living off cookies from the canteen and shouting ineffectual defiance of Batista 's coup . Police calmly ringed the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demonstration soon petered out . <P> Pro himself learned the bitter facts on the morning of Batista 's coup , when he fled Havana to organize resistance in eastern Cuba . Arriving by back roads at Matanzas , 100 miles east of Havana , he found Batista 's captains and lieutenants already in command . On learning by telephone that garrisons further east were also in Batista 's hands , he gave up and drove back to asylum in Mexico 's Havana embassy . As he posed for photographers before taking off for exile in Mexico the next day , there were tears in his eyes .
