If the Administration was ready to drop an optimistic other shoe for the benefit of airpower alarmists last week , there was no such confident posture on an equally important question : Has the time come for a new look in foreign aid ? For weeks there has been talk that a thorough review of U.S. assistance abroad was in the offing with stress on two problems : 1 ) How broad shall economic aid ? and 2 ) How will it be distributed ? Congress has shown a willingness to mark time on 1957 foreign-aid appropriations until the review is completed . <P> Last week President Eisenhower invited key House and Senate leaders to his White House study for a two-hour discussion with Secretary of State John Foster Dulles . Instead of a long-range program , the men from Capitol Hill got an alternative : approve a flexible , $4.9 billion 1957 program now ; after that undertake a more thorough joint executive-congressional study . <P> Broad View . Next day Secretary Dulles flew off to the meeting of the NATO ministerial council in Paris . phrasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . Questioned on foreign aid at the presidential press conference later in the week , Ike also seemed anxious to keep to broad terms . But he insisted on one point : " The present program has been built up on what we believe to be a minimum basis , " and should not be cut . He hoped to see a commission formed that would start from this basis , report by about Jan. 20 its feeling on the big question : " In the years to come , where is U.S. aid going ? " <P> Ike picked one place that it is not going : through the United Nations . The President rejected Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge 's suggestion that a larger share of U.S. aid be channeled through the U.N . Explained Ike : theoretically the idea is sound , but practically the U.N . is much too muddied by international politics for the Lodge idea to work . Our efforts , he said , must be as of now largely on a " bilateral basis . " In Paris Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act be misconstrued as resurgent Western colonialism . By rejecting these two outlets , the Administration was laying down some ground rules for Ike 's long-range review . <P> Rigid Fix . Into his 30-minute press conference , Eisenhower crammed some other solid answers . Acknowledging a Washington debate over whether or not the U.S. is headed for inflation , he reaffirmed an earlier statement backing the Federal Reserve Board 's decision to raise interest rates to member banks although the President 's own administrators opposed the decision ( see BUSINESS ) . In an off-the-cuff opinion , he suggested that Illinois ' Senator Everett Dirksen 's proposal to limit income taxes to a 25% ceiling might get the Government into " a very rigid fix . " He revealed that he had persuaded retiring NATO Commander General Alfred Gruenther not to retire " for a long time , but I could n't do it forever . " <P> <P> When a reporter sought comment on the Chotiner investigation ( see below ) , the President laid down a two-prong code of ethics for the Government people under him . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , if anyone comes claiming privileges on the basis of a White House connection , " he is to be thrown out instantly . "
