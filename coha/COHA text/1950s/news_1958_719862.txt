txt WASHINGTON , July 18 ? John Foster Dulles , Secretary of State , told a . Senate committee today he doubted the Soviet Union would intervene militarily in the Middle East . At the same time , both he and President Eisenhower made strong . representations to Congress for strengthening the Administration 's badly battered foreign aid bill . The President invited eight Senate leaders from both parties to the White House tonight ' to discuss the foreign aid program amid speculation that he intended to ask for new funds for friendly Middle Eastern Governments , Mr. Dulles , appearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee , argued that restoration of all funds cut out two weeks ago by the House of // Representatives was a " compelling " necessity at this " grave moment in history . " Earlier this year Congress had authorized a $3,675,500,000 Mutual Security Program . The House , handing President Eisenhower a heavy defeat , appropriated only $3,078,092,500 . Now the Administration hopes to recover a substantial amount , sif the House cut by Senate action under pressure of the crisis atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every dollar that has been authorized , " Mr. Dulles told the Appropriations Committee . Except for Mr. Dulles ' formal statement , the committee session hardly dealt with foreign aid . Instead , the Senators concentrated on cross-examining the Secretary about ' the Middle East crisis. , According to fragmentary reports of what was said in the closed sesi9n , Mr. Dulles said he did not extect Moscow to order troops into the area . He did , however , hold out the possibility that the Soviet Union might make some other dramatic gesture of friendship and assistance to Arab states grouped behind President Gamal Abdel Nasser ? of Egypt . One source said Mr. Dulles expected that Moscow might make new arms shipments to the Nasser grouping . Mr. Dulles was unable to clarify events in Iraq : He told the committee that it was still uncertain what attitude the rebel Government in Baghdad might take toward the West . He also left open the possibility that the rebel Government might still have to face military resistance from dissident troops within Iraq . Dulles Hopes for U. N. Backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not muster support in the United Nations General Assembly for its intervention in Lebanon . Mr. Dulles was said to have replied that he did not rule out the possibility that the necessary twothirds majority might still be won . Tonight 's White House conference with the Senate leadership came as a surprise , although James C. Hagerty , Presidential press secretary , portrayed it as less than extraordinary . The meeting had been scheduled for several days , he said , and was called to discuss the foreign aid program . Those Senators invited were Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , Senate Democratic leader ; William F. Knowland of California , Republican leader ; Mike Mansfield , Democrat of Montana ; Styles Bridges , Republican of New Hampshire ; Thomas C. Hennings , Democrat of Missouri ; Leverett P. Saltonstall , Republican of Massachusetts ; Carl Hayden , Democrat of Arizona , and Everett Dirksen , Republican of Illinois . In his appeal to the Appropriations Committee , Mr. Dulles said that " powerful forces for ' change " in the world would " destroy us if we merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he argued , the House cuts threatened to immobilize this country 's activities M a host of sensitive nations abroad . The $700,000,000 allowed for defense support , he asserted , would mean " inflation and an unacceptable risk of disaster " in Turkey , Spain , Korea , Taiwan , Vietnam , Pakistan and Iran . He urged restoration to the full $810,000,000 earlier authorized . The 50 per cent cut in the President 's contingency fund request ? to $100,000,000 ? would not even meet the " bare minimum " that wool be required in the next five ' months , he said . He urged that the fund be restored to $150,000,000 . The House cut in money for the development loan ? fund , he said , was " the most damaging of all . " The Administration had asked for $625,000,000 in new capital to build up the fund . The House allowed it $325,000,000 . In a half year of operation , Mr. Dulles said , the fund had exhausted the $300,000,000 made available to it earlier . The effect of the House cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either cut its rate of operations in half  --  or stop dead and go out of business halfway through the fiscal year . " Restoration of Fund Asked The House action amounted to a decision that this country should " abandon a large part of the now:free world to Communist imperialism , " he asserted . He asked for restoration of the full $625,000,060 . " These , " he said , " are hours of decision . We must implement policies which will affect the peace of the world and the destinies of our people for years to come . " The Secretary 's statement touched only obliquely on the Middle East . He noted Arab-Israeli tension and Arab nationalism , and the Soviet attempt to exploit these factors in order to promote communism 's cause  - -  against the West . The Russians , he said , " support by propaganda and diplomacy , by arms supply and economic penetration and by subversion , violent movements designed to weaken the area . "                   @ @
