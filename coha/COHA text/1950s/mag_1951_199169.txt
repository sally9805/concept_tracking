In 10 Korean cold last week , a group of intent men prowled through frontline aid stations asking questions , leafing through records , occasionally taking blood samples from G.I.s on litters . The men were no ordinary medics , but specialists from a 26-man Army-Navy-Air Force Cold Weather Injury Team . Their job is to study current treatments for frostbite and look for new ways of attacking it . <P> So far , the Army has used two basic treatments . In one-the " let-alone method " - the frostbitten tissue is gently cleaned and dressed loosely . The patient gets 300,000 units of penicillin and an anti-tetanus injection , and is then evacuated to a hospital where he is kept in a room at 78 temperature and forbidden to smoke ( smoking lowers skin temperature , slows down recovery by hampering circulation in the extremities ) . The second method follows most of the same rules but adds four injections a day of " frostbite solution " - 250 ccs of alcohol , procaine , and , unless the man is wounded , the anticoagulant , heparin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pentagon sent its cold-weather team to Korea two months ago , before the first cold casualties began moving back to evacuation points . The team worked out a plan for two members to serve with each of the Army 's mobile field hospitals , testing half a dozen new drugs on frostbite cases . At base hospitals , nutritionists are checking soldiers ' diets to determine the effect of vitamin C in frostbite recovery . In still other experiments , radar waves are being beamed at frozen arms &; legs to find out how deep the injury goes ; fluorescent dyes are being injected around frostbitten skin to discover the exact extent of the freeze . Both the radar and dye tests should help a surgeon to decide whether amputation is necessary , and if so , how much must be cut . <P> Up front , the cold-weather men live in foxholes to find out how frostbite creeps up on troops , and whether the Army 's new insulated , gum-rubber shoepacks are working effectively . Special weather stations have been set up to chart temperature , humidity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information is checked against the flow of field casualties to determine the exact conditions under which frostbite occurs . Everywhere , team members ask a steady stream of questions : Did your feet perspire ? Were you asleep ? How were you dressed ? <P> By next June , the cold-weather team hopes to be able to tell the Pentagon , once &; for all , the best way to treat frostbite , and how best to prevent it .
