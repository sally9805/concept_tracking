While the immediate fate of the Labor government was being decided in the House of Commons , the House of Lords discussed the chance of a coalition . Said Labor 's Lord Strabolgi : " Whether the King 's government can be sustained or not depends upon whether a few gentlemen have temperatures which are up or down , or are perhaps in hospital , and can come and vote , if at all , only in bath chairs . That is an absurd situation . " <P> Earlier in the week , in the House of Commons , Winston Churchill himself had mused on the possibilities of a " national coalition . " Said Churchill : <P> " Many societies have vanished in the past and found no recorded or recognizable place in history . But never has this hideous fate presented itself more brutally to so numerous , complex and powerful a community as we are , and never has it presented itself to a victorious nation on the morrow of its triumph in saving the freedom of the world . . . <P> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party and class fights , there may never be any chance for the might and glory of Britain to show itself again . Somehow or other we must reach firm ground again and have a government that is not afraid or unable to do things if they are in the national interest . . . I do not believe in coalitions that are formed only as the result of party bargainings . It is vain to suppose that . . . an artificial arrangement between party leaders would meet our needs . . . How deep we shall have to descend the dark stairway which lies before us no one can tell . " <P> Actually , neither the Labor nor Tory leaders really want a coalition now . Churchill , while talking vaguely about coalition without actually committing himself , was making a shrewd play for the votes of many Britons who have a vague idea that coalition is the answer .
