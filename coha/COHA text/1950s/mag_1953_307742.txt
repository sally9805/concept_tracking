The sleek new 12,800-ton Russian cruiser Sverdlov* appeared off the Isle of Wight last week , bound for the coronation naval review . A British pilot went aboard , but Captain Olimpey Rudakov had no need for him . Silent on the bridge , his chest diagonally festooned with medals , Captain Rudakov manipulated a series of levers behind him to convey his orders to the engine room and the helmsman . At the correct spot , the correct time , he dropped anchor . Simultaneously , with a flick of another switch , he set off a 21-gun salute . <P> " According to British naval estimates , " said Radio Moscow , " the anchoring of the Sverdlov should have taken one hour , 20 minutes . The Soviet cruiser anchored in 12 minutes . " Asked the London News Chronicle : " Who said the Russians were no seamen ? " <P> The Ship . As the Sverdlov loomed through the early morning mist , a hum of excitement spread through the dockyard city of Portsmouth : she was the first Russian warship to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was trim and tidy , that she was correctly dressed overall to honor the Duke of Edinburgh 's birthday . Royal Navy liaison officers also marked her power ( twelve 6-in. guns in paired turrets fore &; aft , twelve dual-purpose guns , ten torpedo tubes , double sets of minelaying cables ) and her probable speed ( 35 knots ) . Said the Admiralty : " We find her very interesting . " <P> The Crew . Even more interesting was the inconsistent behavior of the 1,000-man crew . First , there was indecision : <P> The British offered 30 seats for a bus tour of London ; the Russians asked for 150 seats ; no Russians showed up . <P> The British asked them to a dance ; the Russians accepted ; no Russians showed up . <P> But soon they streamed ashore , fresh-faced young sailormen in small and large parties directed by ship 's officers and Russian embassy guides . They drove to London , to Salisbury Cathedral , to Windsor Castle , chorusing sea chanteys and waving at girls . They watched the Queen review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commons , stood for ten minutes in the rain at Karl Marx 's grave . " Their guide allows them two minutes to see the Tower of London , " said the Daily Mirror . " Then he gives them the works . The drab back streets where the poor live . The bomb sites where they died , 45 minutes of dusty reality . " The Mirror professed not to mind : " London can take honest scrutiny as she has taken fire , plague and bomb . " <P> The Review . This week the Sverdlov stood amid 206 British Commonwealth warships , 56 British merchantmen and 15 other foreigners ( including the U.S.S. Baltimore ) as the Queen 's yacht swept down the lines . As the Queen passed by , the Russians cheered her , and a flashing electric sign spelled out Sverdlov . Next day the Russian ship headed toward home , leaving Britons to wonder whether they should scoff any more at a navy that is bigger than theirs . <P> <P> * The Sverdlov is named for Old Bolshevik Leader Yakov Sverdlov , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1918 ordered the execution of Czar Nicholas II and his family .
