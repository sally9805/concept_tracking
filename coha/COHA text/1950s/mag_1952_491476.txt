WIDE WORI-D Can the Rajah Rejuvenate the Browns ? By J. ROY STOCKTON UT in St. Louis this winter the baseball fans have some juicier subjects to bat around than the usual speculation about where their teams will finish in the coming pennant races . One savory topic is how long Eddie Stanky , the Cardinals ' third manager in as many years , will last with owner Fred Saigh . Another is how long Rogers Hornsby , the new manager of the Browns , will last with owner Bill Veeck . Hornsby has been out of the big-league picture for nearly a decade and a half , and many people thought he never would get back . " Explosive " was the word for Hornsby . He was just about the greatest of all right-handed hitters . He also was just about the bluntest , most ruggedly independent manager who ever refused to kowtow to a club owner . Now he is slated to manage Veeck 's Browns for three years , if these two individualists , men of strikingly different personalities , can pull together that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his baseball , a promoter who has given fans fireworks , acrobats , orchids , clowns and a midget as part of the show , and Hornsby , who takes his baseball with deadly seriousness , insist they will get along . " Why should n't we ? " the soft-spoken Veeck asks . " We both want the same thing ? to win . I do n't know anybody who knows more baseball than Hornsby knows or anybody who hates defeat more than I do , unless it 's Hornsby . So he says what he thinks  --  so what ? So do I. " Hornsby , who picked Veeck 's offer  --  at upwards of $25,000 a year ? out of three major-league bids , states grimly that there is n't going to be any trouble . He says , " Bill wo n't sit still for a loser and neither will I. I 've laid my cards on the table . There ai n't going to be any clowns on the ball club any more , and Bill ai n't going to tell me how I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the same thing , first place , the only thing that counts in 010 business . We 'll get along . " But veteran baseball men will have to be shown . They remember how it was in the past . Almost everywhere Hornsby served as skipper or first mate , there was a blowup that cost him his berth ? with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1926 , the New York Giants in 1927 , the Chicago Cubs in 1932 and the St. Louis Browns in 1937 . That last firing appeared to wash up Hornsby in the major leagues for good . He had been hired as Browns ' manager in July of 1933 by crusty old club owner Phil Ball . Ball died a few months later , and control eventually // , , Passed to Donald Barnes , who bounced nornsby in August of 1937 . Hornsby , the most straightforward of men , minces no words about his troubles with Barnes  --  or anyone else . " Anytime anybody thought the ball club was n't going good or wanted to fire me , they blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently . But get this straight : I never made " Y agreement with anybody giving , them control over my private life . I do n't drink and I do n't smoke , and I ' lever did anything to hurt baseball and never will . But if I want to entertain thyself and risk my own money , that 's 1113 ' business . " Well , I 'd been buying some stock Barnes ' investment company  --  he 's t-ti the small-loan business  --  and buying it on time I still owed him $4000 . So , When I collected on a big bet one day during the 1937 season , I told the bookie to give me a cashier 's check for V000 of my winnings , and I gave it to ? turtles to pay off my stock . He asked e where I got the dough , and I said , , 4 won it . How the hell do you think 4 'd get it ? This ai n't payday . ' , " The next day Barnes and Bill De Witt " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me to the ? Mee , and Barnes said he did n't want ' 0 take that kind of money . " I said to him , ' What 's wrong with that money ? I won it fair and square , and that money ai n't no worse than ? the money you get , that interest you charge widows and poor working people for loans . ' The next day I was fired . " During the fourteen years that fol- , ? , Wed , there were rumors occasionally that there was a black ball opposite Hornsby 's name in baseball 's major- , ugue book . Anyway , Hornsby wan- " red in the minors , operated baseball ! ' ehools , took a trip to Mexico  --  depart- il/Ig after a rim-in with the Mexican league 's big wheel , Jorge Pasquel- d then conducted a baseball clinic Or a Chicago newspaper for several seasons . Finally he caught on as a manager in the big minors , with suc- fu/ seasons at Beaumont , in the texas League , in 1950 ; and Seattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All ? I ' a sudden , major-league clubs became ' hterested in him again . " Sure , I felt that the word had been Passed around that I was n't welcome 14 the majors , " Hornsby admits under questioning . " But nobody ever wrote told me or hinted that I was black4slled . " But had n't he been called on the ettl'pet by the late commissioner , Judge tiesaw Mountain Landis ? Yes , the judge called me in , " l ' .. tunisby testifies . " He asked me if I , , ? et , on the races , and I told him I did . ' 10 said I ought not to be doing that , 4 , od I asked him why not . I told him ' t Was my own money , that I COU1 ( 1 , do What I pleased with it , and that if it the all right for him to lose money in 40 stock market , I guessed it was all tight for me to risk a few bucks on the horses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked it much . I told him what I thought . " That outspokenness , as much as the I race betting , is what has canted many c'f . Hornsby 's difficulties . So it was with his first firing in 1926 . Owner Sam ? readon , of the St. Louis Cardinals , got rid of him even though the Rajah was the idol of the city , having just brought St. Louis its first pennant and world 's championship as playing manager of the Cardinals . The Cardinals of 1926 were not a wealthy ball club . As in other years , they were trying to make ends meet by picking up a few exhibition-game dollars . All open dates had been filled with exhibition games arranged months in advance . When the Cardinals unexpectedly found themselves in the thick of the pennant race , Hornsby wanted to conserve everybody 's strength for the main job in hand . He asked Breadon to have the remaining exhibition games canceled . Breadon agreed to see what could be done , but explained that it would be difficult to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing had made them more attractive than ever to the small-town promoters . After a tough one-run defeat in Pittsburgh , Breadon entered the players ' dressing room and reported to Hornsby that he was sorry , but the exhibition games would have to be played . When Hornsby , in front of all the players , suggested a vulgar disposition of the exhibition games , a blushing Breadon left the clubhouse , vowing to himself that for no longer than was necessary would this man remain in his employ . And , braving the wrath of the local populace , Breadon did send Hornsby away soon after the season , trading him to the New York Giants for Frankie Frisch and pitcher Jimmy Ring . Everybody thought that Hornsby was in the right place when he joined the Giants of John McGraw . McGraw liked them tough , and Hornsby was that . McGraw made the Rajah his assistant manager . On one occasion McGraw told this writer that he considered Hornsby the logical man to succeed him if and when he decided to step down . But Hornsby got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giant organization there was a traveling secretary , one Jim Tierney , who also served as a sort of private eye and bodyguard for owner Charles Stoneham . Tierney  --  a very gentlemanly fellow , by the way  --  was n't a baseball man , but a person who sees a lot of baseball invariably gets the idea that he does know the game , and Tierney followed the usual pattern . The Giants were in Chicago , and Hornsby , in the absence of an ailing McGraw , was adting manager of the club . A ninth-inning error by Travis Jackson cost the Giants the game , and Tierney took the liberty of sounding of to Hornsby about it . Hornsby did n't like to lose that game either , but he knew that the best of players make errors , and he was n't going to have any traveling secretary criticizing a great competitor like Jackson . So Hornsby told Tierney to keep to the business of getting railroad tickets and hotel rooms for the ballplayers , and not to be sticking his so-and-so nose into the running of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoneham . Tierney 's influence with the club owner was such that at the end of the season Hornsby was traded away to the then lowly Boston Braves , losing his chance to succeed McGraw as Giants ' manager . Judge Emil Fuchs , president of the Braves , gloried in having such a great player as Hornsby , and made Rogers his manager in the spring of 1928 . But the Braves needed money , and when the Chicago Cubs that fall offered $200,000 and five players for Hornsby , the judge tearfully told Hornsby about it . Hog told him he 'd be a damn fool not to take it . At Chicago it was the familiar story . Hornsby became a favorite of owner William Wrigley , Jr. , and rose to the managership . But in August of 1932 there was another storm and another firing . It is interesting to note that Hornsby now is working for the son of the man who handed him his walking papers at Chicago  --  Bill Veeck , Sr. , who was Wrigley 's chief executive on the Cubs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who was instrumental in his 1937 firing by the Browns  --  vice-president Bill DeWitt . Today , nearing fifty-six , Hornsby insists that he has mellowed since those stormy times . But it is n't readily apparent . He still swears at the drop of an adjective  --  he could conduct a language clinic for old-line top sergeants . He 'll listen to you longer now , but he still has opinions that ca n't be swayed . And he wo n't temporize or dicker . Now , in St. Louis , Hornsby at last has his big opportunity to show what he can do as a manager . The Browns , when Bill Veeck bought them last July , were so bad that Veeck said it was necessary to have clowns and fireworks and other extracurricular attractions , so that he  --  and the fans ? would n't have to look too hard at the ball club . The Browns ' lowly estate was one of the reasons why Hornsby wanted to manage them , rather than a club higher in the standings . " There 's only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " And do n't think it 's impossible . Things were almost as bad with the Cardinals in 1925 . We were last when they made me manager in June , but we finished fourth that year , and we won the pennant and series the next season . " The Browns will be trying this year with an almost totally new batch of ballplayers . Some of them may not have very prepossessing records , but neither did Hornsby during his first years as a player . He was just a skinny nineteen-year-old shortstop for the Denison , Texag , club of the Western Association when scout Bob Connery bought him for the Cardinals for $500 in 1915 . He had batted only .232 the previous year and made forty-five errors in 113 games . In 1915 , although he boosted his batting mark to .277 , he had fifty-eight errors in 119 games . However , Connery admired the youngster 's fire and dash . The Cardinals were poor , unable to compete in the open market for minor-league stars . When manager Miller Huggins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hornsby was the best he could find that the club could afford . " Forget his average , " Connery told Huggins . " The kid loves to play ball . He does n't drink or smoke . He 'll make it , and if he does n't I 'll pay that $500 . " Reporting to the Cardinals in Cincinnati on September 1 , 1915 , Rogers played in eighteen games the balance of the year and hit only .246 . He had been holding the bat at the handle end , but Huggins , a little fellow himself , suggested that a kid weighing only 135 pounds had better try to be a choke hitter , so he changed Hornsby 's style . At the end of the season , Huggins was not too optimistic . Talking to the rookie before he went home , Huggins did n't hold out much hope for the young man for next year . February 9. 1951 " You 're too little , kid , " Miller told him . " These pitchers will handcuff you . You ought to be farmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green nineteen-year-old boY from Winters , Texas , to be farmed out meant just that . So Rogers went back to Texas and arranged to spend the winter on the farm of an uncle and aunt near Lockhart . To put on weight , young Hornsby drank gallons of sulk and consumed great piles of fried chicken and daily dozens of homemade biscuits . When the Cardinals gathered in the spring to train for the 1916 season , the Hornsby who reported to Miller Hug ' gins weighed 160 pounds . When $U1 prise was expressed , Rogers naively e ? plained that he merely had done what he had been told to do . He had farmed himself out and put on some weight , so that he could play the baseball be loved . And Hornsby from then on played , baseball . He was the club 's leading ) . hitter in 1916 , batting .313 as he or peared in 139 games , playing first base , third and short . He improved steadily as a batter , but it was several years , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1920 Rog batted .370 , starting ! ' string of six consecutive seasons 10 which he led the National League . Later he was the league batting champion for the seventh time in 1928 . He hit .401 in 1922 , climbed to an amazing .424 in 1924 and followed with .403 01 1925 . His average for the five-year period ending in 1925 was .402 . In building one of the most remarkable batting records in the baseball book his lifetime major-league mark was .358 ? Hornsby used a battini ! stance that observers have come t ' consider the perfect textbook way W. stand at the plate . He stood with Ins feet close together , his right foot against the back line of the batter 's box and his heels as far back as the rules permit ' Hestrode with the pitch and was in 8 position to get his full power into every swing . His blue eyes , which still need no glasses , must have been sharp , for there was a saying that if he did n't swing at a pitch , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude was important too . Each time at bat was a fresh adventure . He never worried about going hitless on previous trips to the plate , firmly confident that he WO more than a match for any pitcher alive . While he was compiling his amazing .424 average in 1924 , the best of this century , he had 227 hits in 536 times at 2 ! bat , including forty-three doubles , four- 3 teen triples and twenty-five home runs ' He drew eighty-nine passes , struck out I thirty-two times and had thirteen sacrifices , including sacrifice flies , which no longer are scored . However , all the sacrifices made just eleven points dif ' ference in his average , leaving him with a still robust .413 . Hornsby went hit ' less in only twenty-two games all season ; his worst " slump " was two successive hitless games . Because of his extraordinary batting ability , little has been said of Hornsby 's other qualifications as a baseball player , but he had them . He could run as fast as the average good runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one of the best double-play arils in baseball . He was said to be weak on catching pop flies , but this observer ca n't remember that Hornsby ever lost a game by missing one . And Rog was to be excused if he was not familiar with pop flies  --  he hit so few of them . 114 the team all confused . He was a great believer in right-handers against left-handers and in using a Iot of pitchers . All I did to straighten out the club was to get Thevenow from Syracuse to play shortstop , and tell the pitchers to quit looking at the bull pen . " Hornsby believes that pitchers nowadays try to do too fine a job . " They try so hard to pitch to a certain spot for each hitter , " he says , " that they miss the strike zone . How many good hitters do you have today ? Not many who can get one hit in three times at bat . My idea is to have the pitchers get the ball over the plate , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on balls that ruin a ball club today , not the hitters . " While Hornsby is credited with having had the perfect batting style , he believes strongly that it 's a mistake to change the style , stance or grip of anybody who is hitting . An example of Hornsby 's theory is Gil McDougald , the young infielder who alternated at second and third for the 1951 Yankees , helping that club materially in its pennant and World Series victories . McDougald played for Hornsby at Beaumont in 1950 and was recommended highly to the Yankees by Rogers . McDougald ' s batting style is extremely unorthodox . He plants his right foot in the back corner of the batter 's box , pointing to right field , with his left foot well back , pointing approximately down the left-field line . But he hits that way . In the spring of 1951 Hornsby called at the Yankee training camp in Arizona and warned Casey Stengel and the Yankee coaches not to try to change McDougald ' s style . On his 1951 Seattle club Hornsby had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Rog 's recommendation , Bill Veeck obtained the player in a complicated deal with the Chicago White Sox  --  one of many deals Veeck has been making . The player is Jim Rivera , an outfielder . " He 's the only player I 've seen in a long time that I 'd pay my way into a park to see play , " is the way Hornsby describes Rivera . One of liornsby 's loudest boosters after he was signed by Veeck to manage the Browns was Clarence Rowland , president of the Pacific Coast League . Rowland said that Hornsby was one of the Coast League 's best assets , and that all the umpires reported that it was a pleasure to work games of the Seattle club , managed by Hornsby . " We wo n't have any trouble with the umpires on the Browns , either , " Hornsby said , when told of Rowland 's remark . " I ca n't see any sense in fighting umpires . Most of the time a player 's just doing that to alibi his own mistakes . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'll always get a fair shake from everybody . " Hornsby went on to tell a story to indicate that he has absorbed a little psychology through the years . " There was a pitcher on the Seattle club , " he said , " who had pretty good stuff , better than average . But he figured everybody was wrong but himself . He never made a bad pitch . He never made a mistake , the way he saw it . He was pitching one day , and the other club got a man on first base in a late inning with the score tied . The pitcher quick-pitched , and the umpire , who had warned him in my presence , called a balk , moving the runner to second . Then the pitcher got mad and quick-pitched again . The umpire called another balk , and the runner moved to third . The batter hit an outfield fly , THE SATURDAY the runner scored to break the tie and we lost the ball game . " He did all that in front of everybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way . In the clubhouse in front of all believed he could control himself . He did n't believe me until his turn came around , and somebody else started the game . " He said he wished I 'd give him another chance , that he believed he 'd be able to show me . So I started him the next day . He pitched a good game , he never squawked at an umpire , never made a face if somebody kicked one , and he has n't squawked at an umpire or made any alibis since . And he 's ready to go back to the big leagues . " While Hornsby generally is considered an intolerant driver of ballplayers , it may be the old story of only the incompetents being unhappy . " I ai n't tough , " he insists . " Take club rules . I let the players make them themselves . I 'll do the same with the Browns . I ' Il have a meeting and ask the players what they think is a reasonable time to be in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Seattle they decided on two o'clock after night games , midnight after day games . But when they make their rules , they 'd better keep them , or it 'll cost them some dough . " Hornsby does n't object to what his men do off the field , as long as they 're in condition to give their best on the diamond . But he is strict about some , things . Any Browns who smoke in the dugout or near the runway , during spring training or the season , will hear sharp words . Any players who appear to be loafing or who indicate that baseball is not their heart and liver will find themselves in the doghouse . Wilbur Wood , former sports editor of the New York Sun , visited Hornsby at Yankee Stadium one afternoon during Hornsby 's previous term as manEVENING POST ager of the Browns . It happened that a rookie infielder had just joined the Browns that afternoon . The rookie took fielding practice , handled half a dozen grounders , threw down his glove and left the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hornsby barked , with his usual pungent verbal embellishments . " Fresh . from the bushes , with a chance in the big leagues , and he thinks he 's done a day 's work . When I was a kid ballplayer , they 'd have to drive me eway from there with a club . " While the Browns were in Washington that year they blew a game in the ninth inning to the Senators . In the clubhouse after the game , the suffering Hornsby heard one player gaily discussing what movies were showing that night , another doing an Amos-'n ' - Andy imitation , still another joking and clowning . Hornsby had all three of them shipped away before the day was out . In recent years many major-league clubs have provided beer in the clubhouse for the players after games . " There wo n't be any of that with the Browns , " Hornsby snapped , when asked about his policy . " I do n't care what they do after they leave the ball park , as long as they stay in shape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They can wait till they get to the nearest saloon , ca n't they ? For criminy sakes , I have to wait for my milk shakes . " Hornsby , strictly a milk-shake-andcandy-bar man , explains that it was his mother 's influence , his desire to be a baseball player and things he saw as a boy that have caused him to go through life thus far without ever tasting liquor or beer , or using tobacco in any form . Hornsby , the youngest in a family of four boys and two girls , was born on his father 's ranch near Winters , Texas . The father , Edward Hornsby , died when Rogers was an infant , and the family moved to a community nine miles from Austin , Texas . There were several Hornsby families February 9 , 1952 in the settlement , and the community was known as Hornsby Bend . When Rog was about four years old his mother moved the family residence to North Fort Worth , where Rogers lived until baseball lured him from his home . The family was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers and did any other odd jobs he could find after school hours . He played baseball at high school and with several kid teams in the neighborhood . His mother was a baseball fan , and made the uniforms  --  of blue flannel  --  for Rogers ' first neighborhood team . His mother , Mary Dallas Rogers Hornsby , died the day he achieved his greatest baseball triumph ? when his Cardinals clinched the 1926 pennant in New York a few days before the season ended . That evening Rogers ' aunt telephoned to him that his mother had passed away . " She knew your team had won the pennant , " the aunt told Hornsby , " and she asked me to tell you that she wanted you to stay with your team through the World Series . " Mrs. Hornsby 's body remained at a Texas funeral parlor while Rogers led his Redbirds to their dramatic World Series victory over the Yankees . Hornsby , who now makes his residence in Chicago , has been married twice . Rogers , Jr. , a son by his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Air Force plane crash on December 22 , 1949 , near Savannah , Georgia . A son by his second marriage , Bill , played for the Oklahoma City club of the Texas League last season , but decided that he was n't a big-league prospect and gave up baseball for the oil business . He is studying to be a driller , working for J. Alvin Gardner , president of the Texas League . As manager of the Browns this year , Hornsby will coach at third base , where , as he describes it , he can direct the most important traffic and bear the heaviest criticism . That responsibility , he says , a manager should assume . " But you wo n't see me running out to the mound every few minutes to show off to the fans or get into the television picture , " he asserts . " When you see me out there you 'll know I 'm not going to take the pitcher out . I 'll ' have something important to say to him . When I want a pitcher removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of there . Nine times out of ten , if you go out to talk to a pitcher , he 'll persuade you to let him pitch to just one more hitter . And like as not that one more hitter will knock one into the seats , and there goes your ball game . " Horse betting is unlikely to become a problem during Hornsby 's new term at St. Louis . He will never sign away his right to make wagers , but he says he has n't placed a bet in more than two years  --  not because of any change of heart , but because his handicapper died , and Hornsby himself does n't know one horse from another . There are mixed emotions in St. Louis about the ? return of Rogers Hornsby as manager . For he 's the kind you admire tremendously or dislike the same way . But by and large the city seems excitedly happy over his return . The baseball fans of St. Louis do n't appear to feel that their ? two-club situation is " intolerable , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it during the October investigation of baseball . St. Louis fans believe that now they 'll have two good ball clubs , with Hornsby to help Bill Veeck rebuild the Browns . It 's good to have Rogers Hornsby , old Mr. Blunt , come back home .
