The Rev. Charlie Shedd dropped to his knees during a morning meditation in Oklahoma and prayed : " Dear God , I 've tried for 15 years to whip this problem of obesity . . . I 've been on banana diets and eaten red meat . I 've taken pills and bought reducing belts . I 've read books and attended lectures , joined clubs and enrolled in courses . But I 'm still fat ... I need help . " <P> He got it . Charlie Shedd , now pastor of the Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church of Houston , lost 100 Ibs. ( from around 300 to 195 ) over a three-year period of prayer and medically supervised fasting , which he describes in a new book , Pray Your Weight Away ( Lippincott ; $2.95 ) .

Second , one must accept God not as a terrible judge but as one " who loves you and wants to be your friend . " Pastor Shedd , 41 , recommends that his fat readers pray God to show them to themselves as they really are , to show them what he wants them to be , and to show them why they eat too much . " Teach me to face my hidden self , " he prayed . " Open the windows of my subconscious closets and let in your clean air .

" I have found that whereas I used to go away hungry , when I ask him to bless each bite to his use , I leave the table deeply satisfied . " <P> Another thing to pray for is to like exercise , advises Shedd , and gives readers ten exercises to like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scriptural quotations ( " It will not only tune you in to God , but it will automatically teach you verses of Scripture " ) .
