THE TEAMS ARE FAST AND TOUGH // From Pittsburgh to Boulder , Colo. the panorama of Midwest football unrolls next week , disclosing some of the nation 's most powerful teams in their first encounters . Within the scope of the survey which follows are five of the eleven top-ranking elevens I picked last week . There is Notre Dame , independent and always in the highest bracket ; there is Oklahoma , which dominates the Big Seven ; and , from the ranks of the Big Ten , Illinois , Iowa and Wisconsin . // Less known but no less scrappy are those inhabitants of a 50-mile circuit in Ohio that includes Cincinnati , Miami , Dayton and Xavier . And in the Missouri Valley Conference , there are Oklahoma A &amp; M and Houston . Marquette will bear watching ? last year they gave up a total of only nine points to Michigan State , Wisconsin and Indiana . // The Saturday of September 25 will go a long way toward clarifying the situation in the Big Ten . Iowa meets Michigan State in a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late-season splurge of 1953 , and whether the Spartans have been able to survive the ravages of graduation and the loss of Biggie Munn and practically his entire staff . // More important than the championship in the Big Seven this year may be the runner-up spot . Oklahoma is not eligible to play twice in succession in the Orange Bowl , so if the Sooners win the second-place team will take the trip . The competition will be heated , and it will be no less so in the Missouri Valley Conference and among the independents . // THE BIG TEN // Illinois . The Illini have the best chance of winning the Big Ten title and going to the Rose Bowl . The team of J. C. Caroline and Mickey Bates , sensational in 1953 , may turn into a 1-2-3 punch this season with the addition of sophomore speedster Abe Woodson . The line led by Captain Jan Smid and Don Tate at guards should be formidable . // Iowa . Time and Michigan State will tell . Calvin Jones , at guard , and End Frank Gilliam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten in rushing defense last year . Captain George Broeder was the top Big Ten punter in 1953 and led all the Hawkeye ground gainers with a 4.2 yards average per try . Coach Forest Evashevski 's varied offense is very tough to outguess , but even more important is the renaissance of Iowa spirit . // Wisconsin . Ivy Williamson , with 21 wins , 7 losses , and 4 ties , has recently been the " winningest " coach in Big Ten play . He has a severe schedule this season , but fine sophomores , good varsity holdovers including Quarterback Jim Miller and last , but not least , Alan " The Horse " Ameche again make Wisconsin a title threat . // Michigan State . Over the past three seasons Spartan teams have lost but one of 27 games . They could go on for the title although they 've lost 15 players , eight of them regulars , and three coaches . On the other hand , 20 lettermen have returned including such names as Halfback Leroy Bolden , Tackle Randy Schrecengost , Guard Hank Bullough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Backs Lou Costanzo and Rudy Gaddini , End Lacey Bernard , Tackle Ron Latronica and Center Don Berger . Last year 's Rose Bowl champions will be younger and thinner , especially in the backfield , than Michigan State teams have been in the past four years . // Ohio State . As usual , they 're optimistic at Columbus ; as usual , their supporters have their fingers crossed . Twenty-five lettermen are back . Quarterback John Borton , injured last year , should regain his 1952 form . The backfield is capable and deep . Howard Cassady and Bob Watkins are veteran backs with speed . They are being pushed by Jerry Harkrader and Jimmy Roseboro . Last year 's fullback problem will be solved by two promising sophomores , Don Vicic and Hubert Bobo , battling for the starting position . The line , led by Ends Dick Brubaker and Dean Dugger , has plenty of size but may lack over-all speed . First test is improved Indiana on September 25th. // Minnesota . Peerless Paul Giel is pitching for the baseball Giants and not Minnesota this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teammate , Murray Warmath , Minnesota 's new head coach , to have the surprise squad in the Western Conference this season . He 's got 22 lettermen as a squad nucleus . The backfield speed is good . The McNamara brothers lead a competent group of halfbacks . Any Warmath-coached line will be rugged . On the pessimistic side the sophomores are sparse , and Co-Captain Jerry Helgeson was knocked out of his post at center by injury last week . For the first time in 54 years Minnesota will not have any single-wing plays . The Split T has been installed . I repeat : MY Sleeper . // Michigan . Michigan has to rebuild this year . Fourteen lettermen , 11 of them linemen , are missing . But they have the material . Outstanding men returning are Halfback Tony Branoff , Tackle Art Walker and Quarterback Duncan McDonald . Good sophomores are in abundance with End Ron Kramer and Halfback Terry Barr outstanding . The Wolverines will use more T this year . They should be a good passing team , with McDonald as the best passer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a year away from their usual top ranking . // Purdue . Stu Holcomb contrives at least one upset each year . Last season he broke Michigan State 's long winning streak and then finished off his traditional rival Indiana by a 30 to 0 score . With the exception of one halfback , that same starting team is available this fall . Guard Tom Bettis is the outstanding candidate for national honors . Other stalwarts are End John Kerr , Halfback Rex Brock and Tackle Joe Krupa . Leading sophomores are Quarterback Leonard Dawson and Tackle Ed Voytek . As usual Purdue is faced with a difficult schedule but should improve on last season 's record . // Indiana . Coach Bernie Crimmins says : " We have more to work with this year than either of my first two years at Indiana . We 'll be very inexperienced but bigger , faster and , I feel sure , more successful . " The team may move up in the standings . Quarterback Florian Helinski and Tackle Nate Borden are possible All-Big Ten selections . One of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Olympic decathlon star , who was a spring practice sensation but has not been tested under game conditions . Ohio State should provide that in the opener on September 25th. // Northwestern . Coach Bob Voigt 's 1954 Northwestern team will be much stronger than those of the last few years ? but so will most of its opposition . A veteran team built around 24 lettermen will provide experienced players at every position . A better than average freshman squad of last year figures to add much needed replacement strength . Biggest problem is developing a capable T quarterback . Center John Damore and Fullback Bob Lauter , the 1954 co-captains , are outstanding . Fine sophomore prospects are End Jack Stillwell , Quarterback Ed Broeker and Guard John Lohbauer. // THE BIG SEVEN // Oklahoma . Oklahoma , barring a stunning upset , should win its seventh straight Big Seven Championship . Actually , Oklahoma has outgrown the conference . It has more important engagements in the big intersectional battle at Berkeley this Saturday , and the Texas game in Dallas on October 9th . The Sooners have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oklahoma high school players . Ends Max Boydston and Carl Allison , Quarterback Gene Calame , Center Kurt Burris , and Halfback Buddy Leake , who has converted 50 out of a possible 52 extra points in his career , are all on hand . That gives you some idea of the Sooners ' scoring potential . // Missouri . Signs point to second place and the Orange Bowl for Missouri . The Tigers , with three lettered quarterbacks returning , should have sound leadership . They have a hard core of senior veterans who got their baptism in 1951 when freshmen were eligible . Charles Bull is the leader of this group at tackle . Bob Bauman at fullback and Terry Roberts at guard were All-Conference last year . Ray Detring , a halfback , and End Pete Corpeny are also outstanding . Don Faurot 's seventeenth squad at Old Mizzou may be his best . // Colorado . Coach Dal Ward says : " We have as fine a set of backs as anyone could want with Carroll Hardy , Frank Bernardi and Emerson Wilson . " Hardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite injuries he has a three-year record of 6.1 yards average gain . If eight graduating linemen can be replaced Colorado could beat out Missouri and spend New Year 's in the sun . // Kansas State . Coach Billy Meek may have the sleeper . He told me : " This is the best-looking physical squad at K-State since 1951 . For the first time we have a few 200-pounders on the line . We will be capable of giving any opponent a tough battle . " Corky Taylor is a halfback to note and Ron Marciniak at guard is outstanding . Even though eight starters are lost Kansas State will be an improved team . // Nebraska . Biff Glassford has n't had the kind of material that once made the Cornhuskers the scourge of the West . He has had his troubles during the past year with players and athletic administrators , but temporarily at least he has weathered the storm . He has some fine backs returning in Jon McWilliams and Bob Smith . Speed up front , however , is badly needed . // Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new regime . His best men are Captain Bud Buxler at center , Halfbacks Ralph Moody and Bob Allison , and Fullback Bud Laughlin , back from the service . Coach Mather 's comment on the coming season : " We wo n't know much about our prospects until November 20th . Our season ends on that date . " // Iowa State . There is building to be done at Iowa State . Fourteen lettermen are lost from the team that beat Missouri 13-6 last year . Max Burkett , an All-Conference fullback , and Gary Lutz , an excellent halfback , are back . Leading sophomore prospects are John Breckenridge at quarterback and Don Schulze at tackle . // THE INDEPENDENTS // Notre Dame . Much has been written about the big task that faces youthful Terry Brennan in his first year as head coach . Terry has been brought up in the Notre Dame tradition and groomed well for the position . His team has lost more in quality than in numbers . Ralph Guglielmi at quarterback is another coach on the field and has a sensational emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another great year at halfback . Better linemen than Frank Varrichone and Ray Lemek wo n't be found . Word comes from Notre Dame that Terry is " putting them through the mill , " and there are many minor early season injuries , but if I know Notre Dame they will be healed into toughness for that first great test with Texas on September 25th. // Pittsburgh . Red Dawson will have a better team than last year , but his schedule is even more difficult . Tackles Lou Palatella and Eldred Kraemer will bulwark the line . Halfback Henry Ford is the leading back . // Cincinnati will have another one of its fine teams this year , if all its successful seniors still have the will to win . Halfback Dick Goist is tops . Glen Dilhoff is an end to watch , Mike Murphy is a brilliant quarterback , and do n't forget Dave Faulkner at center . // Miami University of Oxford , Ohio is a tough neighbor of Cincinnati and should win the Mid-American Conference , with Ohio University in the second spot . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's outstanding tackle . // Marquette has been Big Ten caliber for many years , and this year has more depth than in 1953 . Halfback Ron Drzewiecki ranks with the best , and Quarterback Dick Shockey and Fullbacks Bob Girman and Dave Donarski are also outstanding . Tackle Frank Scaffidi is a rock in the line . // MISSOURI VALLEY // Oklahoma A &amp; M , under J. B. Whitworth , should win this far-flung championship , and maybe , someday , upset Oklahoma . Fred Meyers , erstwhile West Point transfer , is expected to do ; a great job at quarterback. // Houston . Young and powerful , the Texans should be another fine team this year despite the loss of Quarterback Bobby Clatterbuck . Jimmy Dickey is a hot junior college replacement . The best runner is Kennie Stegall with a 1953 average of 6.9 yards per try . // Detroit . The co-champions of last year with A &amp; M will again be in the running . Outstanding letterman is Bob Burgmeier , last year 's high scorer in the conference .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
