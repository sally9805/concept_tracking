Other Goods <P> Sir : <P> Your article on the International Trade Fair at Poznan painted the American participation as a great success . To an impartial observer , it seems that U.S. propaganda against Communism may be called " consumer-goods propaganda " because it is based on the endless repetition of the affirmation of high American living standards . This is like the rich man 's bragging about his richness before poor people who can never become rich . What the people behind the Iron Curtain really need is for the U.S. to get rid of the Communist yoke-and not an exhibition of U.S. consumer goods . <P> <P> BORYS WASTCHUK <P> Louvain , Belgium <P> Sir : <P> I saw the faces of the Polish women in your picture , and I want to try to tell them and others who consider the U.S. a rich country that the dollar sign is an inadequate picture of us and our country .

Most of us carry a knife with us for such a specific purpose . <P> <P> ( SP/2 ) HERBERT V. DODGE U.S.A.F. % Postmaster New York City <P> Paratrooper Flugum was so entangled in several static lines that even if they were cut he could not have opened a parachute. - ED . <P> <P> For More Than Sleeping <P> Sir : <P> Hooray for Mr. John Maass and his kind words about the long-abused American Victorian house July 1 . My husband and I live in one of them with our three small sons who fight over the privilege of sleeping in the " tower room .

The sturdy high back that holds you up for the leisurely joy of reading or eating breakfast in bed . And the high footboard that fences the covers in . As for the overstuffed chairs : I 'll vote for them over the scratchy straw , sagging canvas and thin veneer of today 's contour sitting devices . I 'd like to know whose odd contours shaped them . <P> <P> MRS . ROBERT L. SIMPSON Olympia , Wash . <P> <P> I For a view of the pleasures Reader Simpson extols , see cut. - ED . <P> <P> The Doctor 's Bill <P> Sir : <P> <P> I was extremely surprised and shocked to read in TIME , July 1 about the huge bill for professional services that Dr. Kris sent the Hoopers of Manorville , L.I . for helping pull little Benny out of a well after public uproar , Dr. Kris cancelled his $1,500 bill . Only socialized medicine can curb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dentists in the U.S. and Canada . Things are getting so bad that poor people can not afford to seek medical help , have a tooth fixed , or even fall into a well by accident , without losing their shirts to those professional sharks . <P>
