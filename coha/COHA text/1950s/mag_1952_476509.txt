IN THE winter of 1934 , I spent several weeks in a federal transient camp in California . These camps were originally established by Governor Rolph in the early days of the Depression to care for the single homeless unemployed of the state . In 1934 the federal government took charge of the camps for a time , and it was then that I first heard of them . How I happened to get into one of the camps is soon told . Like thousands of migrant agricultural workers in California I then followed the crops from one part of the state to the other . Early in 1934 I arrived in the town of El Centro , in the Imperial Valley . I had been given a free ride on a truck from San Diego , and it was midnight when the truck driver dropped me on the outskirts of El Centro . I spread my bedroll by the side of the road and went to sleep . I had hardly dozed off when the rattle of a motorcycle drilled itself into my head and a policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister . " It looked as though I was in for something ; it happened now and then that the police gotoverzealous and rounded up the freight trains . But this time the cop had no such thought . He said , " Better go over to the federal shelter and get yourself a bed and maybe some breakfast . " lie directed me to the place . I found a large hall , obviously a former garage , dimly lit , and packed with cots . A concert of heavy breathing shook the thick air . In a small office near the door , I was registered by a middle-aged clerk . He informed me that this was the " receiving shelter " where I would get one night 's lodging and breakfast . The meal was served in the camp nearby . Those who wished to stay on , he said , had to enroll in the camp . He then gave me three blankets and excused himself for not having a vacant cot . I spread the blankets on the cement floor and went to sleep . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sound of running water , and the intermittent flushing of toilets in the back of the hall . There were about fifty of us , of all colors and ages , all of us more or less ragged and soiled . The clerk handed out tickets for breakfast , and we filed out to the camp located several blocks away , near the railroad tracks . From the outside the camp looked like a cross between a factory and a prison . A high fence of wire enclosed it , and inside were three large sheds and a huge boiler topped by a pillar of black smoke . Men in blue shirts and dungarees were strolling across the sandy yard . A ship 's bell in front of one of the buildings announced breakfast . The regular camp members ? there was a long line of them ? ate first . Then we fired in through the gate , handing our tickets to the guard . It was a good , plentiful meal . After breakfast our crowd dispersed . L heard some say that the camps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to catch a northbound freight . I decided to try this camp in El Centro . My motives in enrolling were not crystal clear . I wanted to clean up . There were shower baths in the camp and wash tubs and plenty of soap . Of course I could have bathed and washed my clothes in one of the irrigation ditches , but here in the camp I had a chance to rest , get the wrinkles out of my belly , and clean up at leisure . In short , it was the easiest way out . A brief interview at the camp office and a physical examination were all the formalities for enrollment . T HERE were some two hundred men in the camp . They were the kind I had worked and traveled with for years . I even saw familiar faces ? men I had worked with in orchards and fields . Yet my predominant feeling was one of strangeness . It was my first experience of life in intimate contact with a crowd . For it is one thing to work and travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleep , and spend the greater part of the day cheek by jowl with two hundred men . I found myself speculating on a variety of subjects : the reasons for their chronic bellyaching and beefing ? it was more a ritual than the expression of a grievance ; the amazing orderliness of the men ; the comic seriousness with which they took their games of cards , checkers , and dominoes ; the weird manner of reasoning one overheard now and then . Why , I kept wondering , were these men within the enclosure of a federal transient camp ? Were they people temporarily hard up ? Would jobssolve all their difficulties7Were we indeed like the people outside ? Up to then I was not aware of being one of a specific species of humanity . I had considered myself simply a human being ? not particularly good or bad , and on the whole harmless . The people I worked and traveled with I knew as Americans and Mexicans , whites and Negroes , Northerners and Southerners , etc . It did not occur to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was something ? innate or acquired ? in our make-up which made us adopt a particular mode of existence . It was a slight thing that started me on a new track . I got to talking to a mild-Iooking , elderly fellow . I liked his soft speech and pleasant manner . We swapped trivial experiences . Then lie suggested a game of checkers . As we started to arrange the pieces on the board , I was startled by the sight of his crippled right hand . I had not noticed it before . Half of it was chopped off lengthwise , so that the horny stump with its three fingers looked like a hen 's leg . I was mortified that I had not noticed the hand until he dangled it , so to speak , before my eyes . It was , perhaps , to bolster my shaken confidence in my powers of observation that I now began paying close attention to the hands of the people around me . The result was astounding . It seemed that every other man had had his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some men limped . One young , good-looking fellow had a wooden leg . It was as though the majority of the men had escaped the snapping teeth of a machine and left part of themselves behind . It was , I knew , an exaggerated impression . But I began counting the cripples as the men lined up in the yard at mealtime . I found thirty ( out of two hundred ) crippled either in arms or legs . I immediately sensed where the counting would land me . The simile preceded the statistical deduction : we in the camp were a human junk pile . BEGAN evaluating my fellow tramps as human material , and for the first time in my life I became face-conscious . There were some good faces , particularly among the young . Several of the middle-aged and the old looked healthy and well preserved . But the damaged and decayed faces were in the majority . I saw faces that were wrinkled , or bloated , or raw as the surface of a peeled plum . Some of the noses were purple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were many toothless mouths ( I counted seventy-eight ) . I noticed eyes that were blurred , faded , opaque , or bloodshot . I was struck by the fact that the old men , even the very old , showed their age mainly in the face . Their bodies were still slender and erect . One little man over , sixty years of age looked a mere boy when seen from behind . The shriveled face joined to a boyish body made a startling sight . My diffidence had now vanished . I was getting to know everybody in the camp . They were a friendly and talkative lot . Before many weeks I knew some essential fact about practically everyone . And I was continually counting . Of the two hundred men in the camp there were approximately as follows : ( The numbers do not tally up to two hundred since some of the men were counted twice or even thrice ? as cripples and old , or as old and confirmed drunks , etc . ) In other words : less than half the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployed workers whose difficulties would be at an end once jobs were available . The rest ( 60 per cent ) had handicaps in addition to unemployment . I also counted fifty war veterans , and eighty skilled workers representing sixteen trades . All the men ( including those with chronic diseases ) were able to work . The one-armed man was a wizard with the shovel . I did not attempt any definite measurement of character and intelligence . But it seemed to me that the intelligence of the men in the camp was certainly not below the average . And as to character , I found much forbearance and genuine good humor . I never came across one instance of real viciousness . Yet , onthe whole , one would hardly say that these men were possessed of strong characters . Resistance , whether to one 's appetites or to the ways of the world , is a chief factor in the shaping of character ; and the average tramp is , more or less , a slave of his few appetites . He generally takes the easiest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existence as migrant workers presented itself now with some clarity . The majority of us were incapable of holding onto a steady job . We lacked self-discipline. and the ability to endure monotonous , . leaden hours . We were probably misfits from the very beginning . Our contact with a steady job was not unlike a collision . Some of us were maimed , some got frightened and ran away , and some took to drink . We inevitably drifted in the direction of least resistance ? the open road . The life of a migrant worker is varied and demands only a minimum of self-discipline . We were now in one of the drainage ditches of ordered society . We could not keep a footing in the ranks of respectability and were washed into the slough of our present existence . Yet , I mused , there must be in this world a task with an appeal so strong that were we to have a taste of it we would hold on and be rid for good of our restlessness . Y STAY in the camp lasted about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far frOTT1 town , and finally , in April , when the hot winds began blowing , I shouldered my bedroll and took the highway to San Bernardino . It was the next morning , after I had got a lift to Indio by truck , that a new idea began to take hold of me . The highway out of Indio leads through waving date groves , fragrant grapefruit orchards , and lush alfalfa fields ; then , abruptly , passes into a desert of white sand . The sharp line between garden and desert is very striking . The turning of white sand into garden seemed to me an act of magic . This , I thought , was a job one would jump at ? even the men in the transient camps . They had the skill and ability of the average American . But their energies , I felt , could be quickened only by a task that was spectacular , that had in it something of the miraculous . The pioneer task of snaking the desert flower would certainly fill the bill . Tramps as pioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California knows that the pioneers had been giants , men of boundless courage and indomitable spirit . However , as I strode on across the white sand , I kept mulling the idea over . Who were the pioneers ? Who were the men who left their homes and went into the wilderness ? A man rarely leaves a soft spot and goes deliberately in search of hardship and privation . People become attached to the places they live in ; they drive roots . A change of habitat is a painful act of uprooting . A man who has made good and has a standing in his community stays put . The successful business men , farmers , and workers usually stayed where they were . Who then left for the wilderness and the unknown ? Obviously those who had not made good : men who went broke or never amounted to much ; men who though possessed of abilities were Loa impulsive to stand the daily grind ; men who were slaves of their appetities ? drunkards , gamblers , and woman-chasers : outcasts ? fugitives from justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of health ? men suffering with TB , asthma , heart trouble . Finally there was a sprinkling of young and middle-aged in search of adventure . All these people craved change , some probably actuated by the naive belief that a change in place brings with it a change in luck . Many wanted to go to a place where they were not known and there make a new beginning . Certainly they did not go out deliberately in search of hard work and suffering . If in the end they shouldered enormous tasks , endured unspeakable hardships , and accomplished the impossible , it was because they had to . They became men of action on the run . They acquired strength and skill in the inescapable struggle for existence . It was a question of do or die . And once they tasted the joy of achievement , they craved for more . Clearly the same types of people which now swelled the ranks of migratory workers and tramps had probably in former times made up the bulk of the pioneers . As a group the pioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? their descendants ? as one could well imagine . Indeed , were there to be today a new influx of typical pioneers , twin brothers of the forty-niners only in a modern garb , the citizens of California would consider it a menace to health , wealth , and morals . With few exceptions , this seems to be the case in the settlement of all new countries . Ex-convicts were the vanguard in the settling of Australia . Exiles and convicts settled Siberia . In this country , a large portion of our earlier and later settlers were failures , fugitives , and felons . The exceptions seemed to he those who were motivated by religious fervor , such as the Pilgrim Fathers and the Mormons . Although quite logical , this train of thought seemed to me then a wonderful joke . In my exhilaration I was eating up the road in long strides , and I reached the oasis of Elim in what seemed almost no time . A passing empty truck picked me up just then and we thundered through Banning and Beaumont , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles to San Bernardino . s OMEHOW , this discovery of a family likeness between tramps and pioneers took a firm hold on my mind . For years afterward it kept intertwining itself with a mass of observations which on the face of them had no relation to either tramps or pioneers . And it moved me to speculate on subjects in which , up to then , I had no real interest , and of which I knew very little . ? I talked with several old-timers ? one of them over eighty and a native son ? in Sacramento , Placerville , Auburn , and Fresno . It was not easy , at first , to obtain the information I was after . I could not make my questions specific enough . " What kind of people were the early settlers and miners ? " I asked . They were a hard-working , tough lot , I was told . They drank , fought , gambled , and wenched . They were big-hearted , grasping , profane , and God-fearing . They wallowed in luxury , or lived on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt of the earth . Still it was not clear what manner of people they were . If I asked what they looked like , I was told of whiskers , broad-brimmed hats , high bo9ts , shirts of many colors , sun-tanned faces , horny hands . Finally I asked : " What group of people in present-day California most closely resembles the pioneers ? " The answer , usually after some hesitation , was invariably the same : " The Okies and the fruit tramps . " I tried also to evaluate the tramps as potential pioneers by watching them in action . I saw them fell timber , clear firebreaks , build rock walls , put up barracks , build dams and roads , handle steam shovels , bulldozers , tractors , and concrete mixers . I saw them put in a hard day 's work after a night of steady-drinking . They sweated and growled , but they did the work . I saw tramps elevated to positions of authority as foremen and superintendents . Then I could notice a remarkable physical transformation : a seamed face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; an indifferent mouth became firm and expressive ; dull eyes cleared arid brightened ; voices actually changed ; there was even an apparent increase in stature . In almost no time these promoted tramps looked as if they had been on top all their lives . Yet sooner or later I would meet up with them again in a railroad yard , on some skid row , or in the fields ? tramps again . It was usually the same story : they got drunk or lost their temper and were fired , or they got fed up with the steady job and quit . Usually , when a tramp becomes a foreman , he is careful in his treatment of the tramps under him : he knows the day of reckoning is never far off . In short , it was not difficult to visualize the tramps as pioneers . I reflected that if they were to find themselves in a singlehanded life-and-death struggle with nature , they would undoubtedly display persistence . For the pressure of responsibility and the heat of battle steel a character . The inadaptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal of the successful pioneers . I also considered the few instances of pioneering engineered from above ? that is to say , by settlers possessed of lavish means . who were classed with the best where they came from . In these instances , it seemed to me , the resulting social structure was inevitably precarious . For pioneering de luxe usually results in a a plantation society , made up of large landowners and peon labor , either native or imported . Very often there is a racial cleavage between the two . The colonizing activities of the Teutonic barons in the B'altic , the Hungarian nobles in Transylvania , the English in Ireland , the planters in our South , and the present-day plantation societies in Kenya and other British and Dutch colonies are cases in point . Whatever their merits , they are characterized by poor adaptability . They are likely eventually , to be broken up either by a peon revolution or by an influx of typical pioneers ? who are usually of the same race or nation as the landowners . The adjustment is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it not been for the complication of secession , might eventually have attained stability without war : namely , by the activity of its own poor whites or by an influx of the indigent from other states . T HERE is in us a tendency to judge a race , a nation , or an organization by its least worthy members . The tendency is manifestly perverse and unfair ; yet it has some justification . For the quality and destiny of a nation is determined to a considerable extent by the nature and potentialities of its inferior elements . The inert mass of a nation is in its middle section . The industrious , decent , well-to-do , and satisfied middle classes ? whether in cities or on the land ? arc worked upon and shaped by minorities at both extremes : the best and the worst . The superior individual , whether in politics ; - business , industry , science , literature , or religion , undoubtedly plays a major role in the shaping of a nation . But so do the ' individuals at the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those who are in the grip of some overpowering passion . The importance of these inferior elements as formative factors lies in the readiness with which they are swayed in any direction . This peculiarity is due to their inclination to take risks ( " not giving a damn " ) and their propensity for united action . They crave to merge their drab , wasted lives into something grand and complete . Thus they are the first and most fervent adherents of new religions , political upheavals , patriotic hysteria , gangs , and mass rushes to new lands . And the quality of a nation ? its innermost worth ? is made manifest by its dregs as they rise to the top : by how brave they are , how humane , how orderly , how skilled , how generous , how independent or servile ; by the bounds they will not transgress in their dealings with man 's soul , with truth , and with honor . The average American of today bristles with indignation when he is told that this country was built , largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from being derogatory , ' this statement , if true , should be a cause for rejoicing , should fortify our pride in the stock from which we have sprung . ? This vast continent with its towns , farms , factories , dams , aqueducts , docks , railroads , highways , powerhouses , schools , and parks is the handiwork of common folk from the Old World , where for centuries men of their kind had been as beasts of burden , the property of their masters ? kings , nobles , and priests ? and with no will and no aspirations of their own . ' When on rare occasions one of the lowly had reached the top in Europe he had kept the pattern intact and , if anything , tightened the screws . The stuffy little corporal from Corsica harnessed the lusty forces released by the French Revolution to a gilded state coach , and could think of nothing grander than mixing his blood with that of the Hapsburg masters and establishing a new dynasty . In our day a bricklayer in Italy , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Russia have made themselves masters of their nations ; and what they did was to re-establish and reinforce the old pattern . Only here , in America , were the common folk of the Old World given a chance to show what they could do on their own , without a master to push and order them about . History contrived an earth-shaking joke when it lifted by the nape of the neck lowly peasants , shopkeepers , laborers , paupers , jailbirds , and drunks from the midst of Europe , dumped them on a vast , virgin continent and said : " Go to it ; it is yours ! " And the lowly were not awed by the magnitude of the task . A hunger for action , pent up for centuries , found an outlet . They went to it with ax , pick , shovel , plow , and rifle ; on foot , on horse , in wagons , and on flatboats . They went to it praying , howling , singing , brawling , drinking , and fighting . Make way for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ' country was built by hordes of undesirables from the Old World . Small wonder that we in this country have edeeply ingrained faith in human regeneration . We believe that , given a chance , even . the degraded and the apparently worthless are capable of constructive work and great deeds . It is a faith founded on experience , not on some idealistic theory . And no matter what some anthropologists , sociologists , and geneticists may tell us , we shall go on believing that man , unlike other forms of . life , is not a captive of his past ? of his heredity and habits ? hut is possessed of infinite plasticity , and his potentialities for good and for evil are never wholly exhausted .
