For her new Press Conference program , Producer Martha ( Meet the Press ) Rountree dreamed up a new TV formula : a scoop a show . The first Press Conference was too successful . Editors across the U.S. lambasted both the show and U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell for using it to break news of an impending Justice Department antimonopoly suit against General Motors ( TIME , July 16 ) . <P> Last week , for the second Press Conference , Producer Rountree had planned to have Tennessee Governor Frank Clement . But since Clement had been chosen to keynote the Democratic National Convention ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Butler vetoed the Press Conference appearance for fear that Clement might tell TV viewers what most already knew : Clement supports Adlai Stevenson . Instead , Rountree was able to book Montana 's Democratic Senator Mike Mansfield for the show . Mansfield 's big news : he , too , is for Stevenson . <P> Though editors ignored her show this time , Producer Rountree had other troubles . In a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on her part that Press Conference guests have to come through with news breaks . Despite this assurance , the New York Times let it be known that staffers will be allowed to appear on Press Conference only if the featured guest is nonpolitical.
