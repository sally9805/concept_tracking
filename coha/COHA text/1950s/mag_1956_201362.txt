As one of his last official acts in Canada , retiring U.S. Ambassador R. Douglas Stuart tackled the thorniest current problem of Canada-U.S. relations : the vague but growing notion that U.S. investment capital is seizing control of the Canadian economy . In a blunt speech last week to the Canadian Club of Vancouver , he spelled out the contribution of foreign investors to Canada 's economic expansion and paid his polite disrespects to those who seemed bent on stirring up trouble between good neighbors . <P> " The alleged domination by U.S. capital of Canadian industry and national resources . . . is being discussed emotionally , " Stuart said . " Those who raise it do not appear to be seeking a solution but rather the creation of an issue to arouse a maximum of suspicion and rasp the pride and self-respect of any Canadian . " <P> Inflammatory Talk . Without naming names , Ambassador Stuart quoted recent remarks by Tory Leader George Drew , one of the chief promoters of the current campaign against U.S. investments in Canada . " We are not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , " Drew had cried . " We are not going to be hewers of wood , drawers of water and diggers of holes for any other country . " <P> Said Stuart : " The descriptions . . . often resemble old-fashioned Communist caricatures rather than sober presentations of fact . " The ambassador then proceeded to cite some sobering facts about Canada-U.S. economic relations : Rather than increasing to dangerous flood proportions , as some special pleaders claim , the flow of U.S. capital into Canada is actually receding . It was $346 million in 1953 , $318 million in 1954 , dropped farther in 1955 . Canada 's great industrial boom in recent years was neither wholly financed nor owned by U.S. investors . About 85% of the overall expansion was financed by Canadians themselves . Incoming U.S. capital went heavily into oil and mining ventures , where Canadians were unwilling to take the risks . Capital movements between Canada and the U.S. travel both ways . Canadians ' per capita investments in the U.S. at the end of 1954 stood at $117 v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need U.S. investment more than U.S. investors need Canadian opportunities . Most of the underdeveloped nations of the free world are pleading for new capital . U.S. capital has gone heavily to stable Canada in the past , but could be cut off quickly if " fear , suspicion or unsettled political conditions . . . tended to discourage it . " Said Stuart : " A withdrawal of sizable amounts of such capital already invested here or a dwindling of the potential supply would be immediately reflected in the rate of growth of the Canadian economy and eventually on the standard of living of every Canadian .
