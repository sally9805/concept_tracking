Sir : <P> It was . . . with quiet applause that I laid aside TIME after finishing the July 4 article on the President . Here at last was something I had waited for : an excellent , concise report of the successes and failures of Eisenhower . . . There were not many failures . . . <P> ELAN TUITE Rockford , Ill . <P> Sir : <P> Why , for a sophisticated magazine like TIME , was it necessary to put any caption at all , let alone the cornball one " The President of the U.S. , " under Mr. Eisenhower 's picture on the cover ? I think his face is known to everyone on earth . . . <P> JULES M. LIEBERTHAL The Bronx , N.Y . <P> <P> Davy &; the Bell <P> Sir : <P> A very good picture of Mr. Eisenhower on your July 4 cover , but have n't you heard that our Davy Crockett had fixed up the Liberty Bell ? <P> <P> JAMES P. KING <P> Radford , Va . <P> Sir : <P> My friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Liberty Bell is still cracked . Maybe Davy did n't patch up the crack like the song says . I wish you would tell me if Davy was a real man or was he just a nobody ? I think he was a good American pioneer hero the way I would like to be , but if he did n't do what he says he did , maybe I do n't want to be like him . <P> <P> CHRISTOPHER WENTWORTH <P> ( Age 8 ) Mexico City <P> TIME reassures Reader Wentworth that Davy Crockett was as real as Walt Disney is , regrets , however , that there is no historical evidence to support the song 's claim . That crack appeared a year after Davy last visited Philadelphia-ED . <P> <P> East Is East &; Chest Is Chest <P> Sir : <P> I wish to protest against your picture of the Burmese Prime Minister 's backstage visit to Kismet July 4 . Although it is quite obvious that U Nu knew what he was doing , a family newsmagazine is hardly the proper place for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pseudo-Eastern undress . <P> <P> A. W. WILSON <P> Lompoc , Calif . <P> Confidentially <P> Sir : <P> Bravo on your July 11 article " Success in the Sewer . " It certainly is shocking to learn that such a large number of Americans degrade themselves by reading such trash as Confidential . . . <P> Soliciting the support of Walter Winchell , a sensationalist himself , only goes further to prove that any intelligent American reader should not waste his or her time turning the cover . <P> <P> LESTER C. GUILBERT Buffalo <P> Sir : <P> You have done a public service by printing the truth about Confidential . . . Your title fits it to a T ... <P> <P> ROBERT KRAUS Washington , D.C. <P> <P> SIR : <P> AT NO TIME IN MY CAREER HAVE I OR ANYONE IN MY EMPLOY EVER BEEN PICKED UP BY POLICE " FOR TAKING PORNOGRAPHIC PICTURES .
