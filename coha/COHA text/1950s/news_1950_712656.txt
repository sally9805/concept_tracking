Letters , o The Times New Tax Proposals The Times ' Position on Secretary Snyder 's Program Is Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : One usually looks . to THE NEW YORK TIMES for an enlightened appraisal of such crucial matters as federal tax policy . But , not only is its editorial criticism of Secretary Snyder 's tax program puzzling in its " whimsical " interpretation of the facts but also strangely lacking in economic sophistication .. Whatever the political implications of the Secretary 's proposals , they merit more serious and intelligent appraisal on grounds of equity and economy than they have received . It is not clear whether THE TIMES is disappointed in the extent of the proposed excise tax reductions . Powerful pressures have been brought to bear to eliminate many of these rates which were imposed during the war ostensibly to curb nonessential spending . But if we are to maintain a balanced tax system which will meet the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to effort and investment it would be ill-advised to be carried away by these demands . It is true that excise tax reduction or elimination would improve the businesses now taxed , but it would be difficult to suggest more appropriate objects of taxation than those retained under the Administration 's proposal . To replace further revenue losses by , say , higher personal income taxes might encounter even greater resistance to economic development . Serious thought should be given to the advantages of diversification achieved by excise taxation . in avoiding too heavy a load on direct income taxes . Oil Subsidies It seems hardly appropriate to dismiss as whimsical the removal of obvious subsidies to the oil companies by the " device of reducing their ' depletion ' allowances . " That the increased tax proposed for this industry is so " drastic " only reflects the enormity of the subsidy it has been receiving for many years despite persistent attempts to remove it . One has only to read the facts of this in the President 's message and Secretary Snyder 's testimony to appreciate the present indefensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonable basis would still perpetuate this anomalous situation in many cases . At the same time THE TIMES ignores other desirable reforms with which I am sure it would agree , such as removing the high " notch rate " on small corporation income , lengthening the period for carry-over of losses , and eliminating other abuses with respect to tax-exempt organizations and capital gains . The increases in estate and gift taxes , against which THE TIMES inveighs as direct taxes on " savings , investment and production , " represent little more than overdue correction of obvious defects which have exposed this source of revenue to erosion over a long period of time . Integration of estate and gift taxes , partial plugging of the life-estate-remainder dodge , and the closing of other loopholes have long been recognized as desirable reforms if such taxation of wealth is not to be a farce . Elimination of the marital deduction , enacted in 1948 , would complete these reforms . Economists are fairly well agreed , that no source of revenue , dollar for dollar , impinges less on economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of " wartime excises " perhaps no bugaboo of the tax system has been more overworked than the " double-taxation " of dividends . If we were , faced with the task of inaugurating a system " of taxing corporation , income *I would be the last to suggest the present basis . But the fact is that . we have lived with the present basis for ? ? many . years . Does anyone who has studied ' the problem doubt that over this period the.corporation tax has been shifted in large part to consumers in higher prices ? The tax can not be borne by the consumer and the stockholder too . It is especially unfortunate that this myth of " double taxation " underlies studies of quasi-scientific validity such as that of Prof. F. W. Crum in the recent Quarterly Journal of Economics , a summary of which just appeared in THE TIMES . This naive assumption hardly does justice to the present state of development of ? theory in this respect , , whatever its shortcomings . Then , too , the tax " leaks " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overlooked in any balanced discussion of the ' subject . GEORGE E. LENT , Associate Professor of Economics , University of North Carolina : ? Chapel Hill , N. C. , Feb. 7 , 1950 . Status of Jews in Iraq To TREE EDITOR OP ' THE NEW YORK TIMES : There appeared in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Feb. 7 a special news item under the , heading , " Jews Leaving Iraq in a Steady . Flow . " It seems to me that this article was inspired by the same motives as the sensational news stories which were published toward the end of October and the beginning of November , 1949 . Our ' Minister and Charg ? d'Affaires in Washington at that time published in THE NEW YORK TIMES ' facts which refuted the . reports of persecution and , discrimination of the Jews in Iraq . His statements were further substantiated by a statement of record from the United States State Department on Nov. 1 , 1949 , which said that investigations conducted . by the United States Ambassador to Iraq did not substantiate  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iraq . Mils most recent news Rein is totally unfounded , because the rights ' of every individual and group in-Iraq are always safeguarded . The Government of Iraq has always treated all its citizens on an equal footing , with no differentiation because of religion or race , and the Jews of Iraq , experiencing this equality with others , are living in an extremely prosperous state , with a relatively high standard of living , enjoy their freedom and go about their business unmolested . I find it is my duty . to bring this information to the attention of your readers in order that they may have a true picture of conditions in my country based upon undeniable facts . AHMED IZZET MOHAMMED , Consul General of Iraq . New York , Feb. 8 , 1950 . Reflecting the Popular Vote Opposition . to Altering Presidential Electoral Procedure Analyzed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW . YORK TIMES : Your editorials of Feb. 1 and 2 persuasively back the proposed " Twentythird Amendment " to change the way in which ' Americans select their Presidents . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has resulted in the election of a President getting fewer votes of the people than his opponent . You also say that opposition from a small group . of Senators , mostly Republican , was ? inevitable . Political expediency always stalks the Washington stage . Harold Hinton 's reports bear you out . Mr. Hinton explains Senator Taft 's opposition to the amendment in A-B-C terms : Presidential elections are always close in Ohio ; the usual margin there is about 125,000 ; so the amendment would result in an electoral vote of 13 to 12 instead of the present 25 to 0 ; the Republicans , who carry Ohio nearly every time , would suffer . Had the amendment been in force , Bryan would have beaten in 1900 ; and , therefore , the amendment bad . I have n't always agreed with Senator Taft . But I have long admired his ability and candor . On this issue you inferentially credit him with complete candor . Maybe you are right . Yet I wonder . In recent years , with the exception of 1946 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The amendment would offer the Republicans golden . opportunities in the South . Maybe there is another angle . As a Presidential aspirant from the state of six Presidents , Taft knows that any candidate carries much more weight into the nominating convention ' if he comes from a state which both has many electoral votes and is close . The amendment would markedly decrease the advantage of potential candidates from those states . A Governor or Senator from Oregon , if nationally popular , would have as good a shot as a Governor or Senator from Ohio at nomination for President . Senator Taft is a realist . Surely he does not believe that the amendment will be ratified by three-quarters of the states before 1952 . I doubt if he is worrying about 1956 , except perhaps for a second term . Yet his opposition to the amendment is hard to understand unless he is thinking either about those years or about future Ohioans with the White House gleam in their eyes . JOHN THOMPSON , Assistant Professor of Law , Yale University . New Haven , Conn. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It seems a pity that men of prominence like Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann and others should lend their names against what they call " acts of judicial censure * * * against legal defenders of political and racial minorities and labor organizations , " in a statement published in THE TIMES of Feb. 1 : If their protest refers to the punishment imposed upon the lawyers in the recent Communists ' trial , it is based on a thoroughly misunderstood premise . If the sixteen signers had taken the trouble to study the record of that trial , they would have discovered that the lawyers were punished not for defending " political and racial minorities " but for persistent misbehavior and contemptuous disobedience to the rulings from the bench and for studied misconduct inconsistent with the dignity and decorum of a court of law . , According to our judicial concept , the judge who presides . at a trial represents the sovereignty of the people . Anyone , whether a lawyer or a layman , who insults the judge and willfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one is subject ' to punishment , and , in my opinion , the punishment of a lawyer who should know better should be all . the more severe .
