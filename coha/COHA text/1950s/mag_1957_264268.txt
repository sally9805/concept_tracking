AS THE first half of the 20th century shakes down into perspective , it seems certain that the art contribution of the Spanish contingent will bulk surprisingly large . Top banana of the bunch is , of course , Pablo Picasso . But there are also Juan Gris , pioneer Sculptor-Welder Julio Gonzlez , Surrealists Jon Mir and Salvador Dali . And now another name is being nominated for the list : the late Manuel Martinez Hugu ( 1872-1945 ) , better known simply as Manolo , whose small-scale bronzes and terra-cotta sculptures are the most earthy and most intensely Spanish art works of the lot . <P> A scampish Bohemian who dressed like a gypsy , sported a wide-brimmed hat and passed himself off as a guitarrista , Manolo boasted that he " knew all the thieves of my time . " No one doubted his word . The illegitimate son of a proud Spanish officer , he was urged to make the army his career ; instead , he deserted when he was drafted , hid out in Barcelona with gypsies , petty thieves and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the side he studied painting and sculpture . <P> Sculpture in a Dairy . A year after his friend Picasso went to Paris , Manolo used his last peseta for train fare , arrived at Paris ' Gare d'Austerlitz knowing one word in French : " Montmartre . " Once there , Manolo rapidly established himself with his peasant shrewdness and high-spirited escapades as the Sancho Panza of Montmartre , and was soon fending for himself . Reports Picasso 's mistress of that day , Fernande Olivier : " Happily , he fell in love with the daughter of a dairyman who hired him each day to sculpture animals and flowers in mounds of butter . " <P> When the butter ran out , Manolo readjusted to poverty . One story has it that he actually pinched a painting from the Louvre , and Picasso returned it to the police . Another time , invited to live with Painter Paco Durio , Manolo took advantage of his friend 's absence to sell off Durio 's Gauguin collection .

What made the difference was a contract from famed cubist Art Dealer Henry Kahnweiler , who still today says of Sculptor Manolo : " I think he was greater than Maillol . " Manolo discovered the charms of the small town of Cret near the Spanish border , and was soon surrounded by vacationing Montmartre friends , including Picasso , Georges Braque and Juan Gris . But though living in the midst of early cubist experiments-French critics called Cret " the Barbizon of cubism " - Manolo would have none of it , once snapped at Picasso , then at work on his cubist Accordionist : " What would you say , Picasso , if your parents were to come to fetch you at the station in Barcelona and found you with such a fright ? " Instead , Manolo stuck to the classic tradition , strove to render bullfighters , gypsy singers , peasant women and children with the ring of truth .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
