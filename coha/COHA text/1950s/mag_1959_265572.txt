Geneva last week was a blaze of flags ; trumpets sounded in the sun-drenched parks , and fireworks sprayed the night sky . Many a tourist assumed that the celebrations had something to do with the Big Four conference . But , at least to Genevans , this was something just as important : it was the 450th anniversary of the birth of John Calvin , in Picardy , and the 400th of Geneva University , which he founded . <P> To the city that Calvin had made " the Protestant Rome " flocked church leaders from 75 Reformed and Presbyterian churches , representing 45 million Protestants who acknowledge Calvin as their spiritual father . Dutch Reformed mingled with Hungarian Calvinist ; delegates from churches in Poland , Rumania , Australia and Madagascar exchanged greetings with delegates from the U.S. and from the Church of Scotland . Said Dr. Harrison Ray Anderson , pastor of Chicago 's Fourth Presbyterian Church : " The Reformist and Presbyterian churches are still the most international of the Protestant groups . " <P> All through Europe , televiewers watched Geneva 's week-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Genevans was Switzerland 's first " Son et Lumire , " a $60,000 pageant of colored spotlights and tape-recorded voices that ranged all over the Reformation Monument , the university and the old city walls to illustrate with real-life details the story of the Great Reformer . <P> Broken Journey . John Calvin was 27 and a thoroughly skilled philosopher-theologian on the July day in 1536 when he first arrived in Geneva-a tired , thin young man of middle height with a pale , finely chiseled face , a long nose and a pointed beard . On his way from Paris to Strasbourg , where he planned to settle down and study , he was detoured through Geneva by military operations , intended to stay in the city only overnight . But a red-bearded Protestant named William Farel , who was having his troubles advancing the Reformation in Geneva , had heard of the brilliant Frenchman 's arrival and went to him at his inn to beg him to stay . Calvin declined . Farel roared at him : " You are simply following your own wishes , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to take part in the Lord 's task in this church , God will curse the quiet life you want for your studies ! " Calvin was thoroughly frightened . " I felt , " he wrote later , " as if God from heaven had laid his mighty hand on me to stop me from my course ... I did not continue my journey . " <P> Within two years , he and Farel were expelled from Geneva for their extreme doctrines , but three years later the city 's council called them back again . And until he died at 55 , dyspeptic and exhausted , Calvin ruled Geneva with the same uncompromising rigor with which he ruled himself .
