YIELD TO THE NIGHT ( 190 pp. ) - Joan Henry-Doubleday ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> Mary Hilton knew she probably would not choke to death . She knew the knot and the drop would break her neck and that they would leave her hanging for an hour to be sure that she was dead . Then she thought of Jim , of her face become black and blue , of her " tongue protruding from dry lips that he once kissed . " " O God , " she thought , " take me out of this terrible place ... I ca n't go on . I ca n't stand it . . . " <P> For killing her lover 's other mistress in cold blood , Mary Hilton was going to take " the 9 o'clock walk , " that morning stroll in which England 's condemned cover their last mile . Yield to the Night is the story of Mary Hilton 's last three weeks on earth and the price she pays for murder . It is a high price in accumulated terror . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of an ignorant but intelligent homicidal type are not profound , but intense . <P> The story is told by Mary in an inner monologue . Everyone is solicitous of her health ( " You can catch your death this weather " ) , but death is so close and horrifying that she cries : " I am too afraid to be sorry ... I want to be brave but I can not . " Feeling like an animal because she is always watched , Mary knows only two inescapable realities : prison and fear . Gradually her fear mounts to hysteria . She loses all control , screams in her sleep , abandons even vanity . Using lipstick would be indecent now , she thinks , " like painting the face of a corpse . " In the end Mary can not even think any more , and her execution , even to her executioners , seems meaningless and barbaric . <P> Yield to the Night has an authentic flavor because Novelist Henry is something of an expert on life in English prisons , having herself served an eight-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks ( she pleaded , and still pleads , not guilty ) . She is 40 , pretty , a cousin of Bertrand Russell , and a great-great-grandniece of Sir Robert Peel. * In prison Author Henry was called " the lidy , " and told , " You talk lovely , but it do n't get you far , do it , if you end up here ? " But she turned her experience to good account with Women in Prison , a 1952 British bestseller , and now with Yield to the Night , which , though falling short of the tragedy it might have been , is a powerful argument against capital punishment . <P> <P> * Founder of the London police force and known as Bobbie the Peeler , after whom London cops are nicknamed bobbies.
