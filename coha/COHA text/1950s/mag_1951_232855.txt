John T. Batura , New York City fireman , his wife Anna and their two youngsters , Barbara , 5 , and Richard , 4 , marched into The Bronx 's Montefiore Hospital for thorough examinations last week . Nurses and doctors made detailed case histories of all the ailments the Baturas have ever had , gave them top-to-toe physical tests . Later , a psychiatric social worker gave them a going-over . None of the Baturas was ill , but they were making U.S. medical history . <P> The Baturas are the first of 20 families chosen for an experiment in preventive medicine ! Instead of waiting until illness strikes , the project will try to keep the families healthy through the combined forces of clinical medicine , social work , psychology , psychiatry and education . A public-health nurse will visit the Baturas and the other 19 families to discuss and prescribe diet , recreation and rest habits . The psychiatric social worker will try to spot tensions within the families which might upset either mental or physical health . <P> The 20 families were chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepaid Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York . They will pay nothing extra for the experimental service . ( The Community Service Society is footing the bill . ) Another group of 20 families will be chosen to serve as a control : over a five-year period , the health records of the two groups will be compared to see whether the preventive approach pays off . The sponsoring institutions will try to figure out how much the preventive program would cost subscribers on a regular basis . Says Dr. Martin Cherkasky , director of Montefiore : " We think we 're offering people what they want-a place where they can get guidance and treatment for everything from a kidney stone to an unhealthy rivalry between sister and brother .
