Hello . I want to get the line on the leading college games on Saturday . <P> O.K. . . . Here we are . Baylor-California : Baylor 7-point favorite . Texas Christian 19 over Kansas . Notre Dame 14 over Southern Methodist . Pittsburgh 7 over West Virginia . . . <P> How about the National League pennant race ? <P> As of today , Brooklyn 4 to 1 over Milwaukee . Cincinnati is out . <P> <P> Thus went a long-distance phone call between New York and Federal 8-5656 in Minneapolis . The number belongs to Athletic Publications , Inc. , popularly ( though inaccurately ) known as " the Minneapolis Clearing House . " Last week subscribers to its highly specialized services kept the phones jumping . The football season had opened , and soon the world would stop for the World Series . Behind the cheering squads , the home-run heroics and the whole windblown outdoor excitement of one sport ending and another beginning lurked an excitement of a very different kind . Millions of Americans bet heavily not merely on horses but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars wagered on Saturday 's halfbacks , even more on the strong arms of Series pitchers . And from high rollers to " little jerks " ( as the big bookmakers call hole-and-corner operators ) , every smart-money boy knew he would get the sharpest line from Leo Hirschfield 's handicappers at Athletic Publications , Inc. * <P> The U.S. nourishes about a dozen other oddsmaking establishments . Some beef up their income by peddling parlay cards ( insidious lists of the week 's games with which small handbooks tempt small bettors ) ; some even book bets on the sly . None are as large , or as furiously legitimate , as the Clearing House . <P> The Odds-Makers . A World War I marine , sometime law student and businessman ( lighting fixtures ) , Leo Hirschfield in 1940 bought out Minneapolis ' Gorham Press , which published a weekly football record . Under its new name , the press now puts out schedules and record books , covering basketball , football and baseball . And it operates a daily oddsmaking service for clients ( who pay up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on college and National Football League games , college and National Basketball Association games , quotes the day 's prices on baseball games in both major and minor leagues . <P> Just how the three Clearing House handicappers combine their predictions to work out the odds quoted to customers is their big trade secret . But they collect their information in a perfectly prosaic manner : they subscribe to 59 daily and Sunday newspapers , study 97 college papers ( including the Harvard Crimson and Yale Daily News ) . " We do n't hire coaches or students to work for us as agents , " says Hirschfield . But so accurate are his odds over the long run that the rumor-however unfounded-persists that he has knowing operatives on every campus . <P> Hirschfield , now 60 , is inevitably thought of as the adviser to a ring of clever bookmakers . This upsets him . and his unvarying reply is : " I am no outcast .
