txt Until President Eisenhower again takes firm control of the political situation within his party there is some possibility of a gradual drift apart of the liberal and the conservative wings . More and more until recently these two groups have tended to coalesce and cooperate under the popularity of Mr. Eisenhower , but in the last few months there have been signs of rivalry over future control of the party . Knowland Contained ? The need for coordination is now becoming apparent and Mr. Eisenhower 's return from Denver will enable him to give closer personal attention to a matter which could be of first importance in the GOP presidential convention at San Francisco next year and later on in the campaign . Senate Republican leader William F. Knowland of California is generally reckoned a leader of the GOP conservative wing . He feels that President Eisenhower should say definitely one way or another , and fairly soon , whether or not he intends to be a candidate for renomination . Senator Knowland has made it plain that he would like to be a candidate himself if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bit over the delay . Meanwhile , White House strategists appear to be confining Senator Knowland by postponing the time of decision . This prevents the right wing from getting its own organization launched , while it gives Mr. Eisenhower opportunity to make his decision and perhIps decide on the man he would back if he decides not to run himself . The conservative wing of the party is strongly entrenched in the Republican national headquarters and in committees like that headed by Senator Barry Goldwater ( R ) of Arizona . This is the committee for the reelection of GOP senators . Senator Goldwater is chairman . IStrateg-v Moves Important strategy conferences were held here recently in the absence of Mr. Eisenhower at a " school " for the Republican chairmen of the 48 states . It was at this session , held under the auspices of the Republican National Committee , that Senator Goldwater , chairman of one of the co-sponsor labor groups in the 1954 election which the Republican National Committee charges amounted to $2,057,613 . Senator Goldwater originally charged that the labor groups are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Democrats . A note of warning is being issued by the so-called " Eisenhower - wing " of the party against an all-out attack on organized labor by the old guard . Maryland 's Republican Gov . Theodore R. , who put Mr. Eisenhower 's name in nomination at the 1952 Chicago convention , charged that GOP senators are creating a " straw man " in their attacks and that it may react against the party . At the same time the CIO Political Action Committee hit back with its own analysis of 1954 election expenditures , declaring the Republicans spent $7,215,589 of which the du Pont family , " the Melions of Pittsburgh " and " The Pews of Philadelphia " gave substantial sums . reminiscent of vitriolic past campaigns directed against Truman-Acheson foreign policy on the charge that it was " soft " toward communism , and is at marked variance with the recent expressions of President Eisenhower . These are minor matters in themselves but they indicate a restiveness within the inner leadership of the Republican high command which could bring a tug of war between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
