A CHARMED LIFE ( 313 pp. ) - Mary McCarthy-Harcourt , Brace ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> Among those puffing their way up the descending escalator of intellectual fashion , many have cause to remember the shrewdly placed elbow and deft umbrella of a comparative shopper in ideas called Mary McCarthy . <P> In the nylon bluestocking set , she appears to be the most enviable of women . She is still remarkably handsome at 43 . She is renowned among her friends both as a wit and a cook . She is currently in Venice , long after the mere tourists have gone , and in Manhattan her husband is shopping for an apartment suitable to her taste . With her latest novel , A Charmed Life , barely on the counters , a new book ( about Venice ) is already commissioned . She is quite possibly the cleverest writer the U.S. has ever produced . <P> Out of the Sweater . Mary McCarthy has marked most stages of her life with a book or story or critical essay-not to mention several thousand yards of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . Her first book , The Company She Keeps ( 1942 ) , told of a girl who suffers guilt by association of one kind or another with a Yale man , an art dealer , and , most painfully-because the fellow was no intellectual-in a Pullman compartment with a man in a Brooks Brothers shirt . The Oasis ( 1949 ) was a sailor 's farewell to the remnants of New York 's intellectual Left ; it began with the arrival of a bunch of New Utopians , their cars laden " with whisky , cans and contraceptives , " and left them at the end without even their illusions . After The Groves of Academe ( 1952 ) , the U.S. progressive college will never be the same again ; in that book Mary McCarthy ( who taught at Bard and Sarah Lawrence ) posed the dilemma of the liberal president who could not fire an incompetent professor because the fellow had cunningly pretended once to have been a member of the Communist Party . <P> As she herself has told her own story , she was orphaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , passed around among relatives , and sent to a convent in Seattle . She went East to Vassar ( class of 1933 ) , became a Phi Beta Kappa in her senior year , and married successively an actor called Harold Johnsrud ( divorce ) , Edmund Wilson , the novelist-critic ( divorce , one son , now 16 ) , and finally Bowden Broadwater , an occasional writer some years her junior . <P> Mary was far from the average Vassar girl who just wanted to beat Emily to the Post . She set herself apart from both the socially conscious and the " blue-eyed Republican girls " by a romantic Royalism and a devotion to the past . She was a Latinist and knew more about St. Thomas Aquinas than about the contemporary Thomas ( Norman ) for whom many of the faculty members cast their votes . Outwardly , there was nothing much to set her apart from the conventionally unconventionalVassar girls who , on graduation , shec their pearls and Brooks sweaters anc swarm down the Hudson to arrive , after false start or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magazine . <P> Nothing much , that is , except a passion for just relations between men and society , nouns and verbs.
