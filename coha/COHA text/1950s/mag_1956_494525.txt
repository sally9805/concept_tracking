The Dinosaurs Are n't All Dead our society a dinosaur alive , ambulatory , and ing defiance of the culture which threatens him extinct . Some such prehistoric monster ap ? peared recently in San Francisco as a " leading spokesman for the West Coast timber industry , " to warn his fellows of the impending doom . As the San Fran ? cisco Chronicle reports the address by this individual at the opening session of the Pacific Logging Congress , the speaker declared that the Republican Administration , like its Democratic predecessor , has committed America " to socialism ? to a garrison economy ? a welfare state in so many major ways that there is little hope we may extricate ourselves . " As I turn to my encyclopedia in an effort to under ? stand this phenomenon , I find that the dinosaur was a sub-class of ' Mesozoic reptile . It says here that the dinosaur 's brain was always small , or " extremely tiny . " It also says that " the most massive part of the whole central nervous system lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took a lot of time for an impulse to travel from the sensory surfaces to the brain . Indeed there could have been occasions when an important impulse simply got lost along the way . Anyway , this Timber Firm Head finds that the root of all evil lies in the income tax . Says he , and I quote , " Had it not been for the sixteenth amendment the income tax making government our master , it could not have seized almost $50 billion from its slaves to give to foreigners . Except for it , we would not now be saddled with grants-in-aid , charity housing projects , government competition with its citizens , or the hoax called social security . It is the income tax also which is at the bottom of such " usurpations " as federal high ? way programs and federal aid to education . And it 's all of a piece with the " palpable fraud " of old-age bene fits , and the " strict federal regimentation " that has enveloped the subsidized farmer . Worst of all , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter , the encourage ment of the power of labor unions was said to be the " greatest of all government thievery . " And then the Timber Firm Head says himself : " What appears to be a struggle between labor and capital is , in actuality , a conflict between labor monopoly and the community . " These labor monopolies " are essentially occupation armies within our economy as long as they retain the power to throttle whole industries . " The most inclusive indictment of the evils of our society , however , lies in this simple proposition : " All organ ized minorities are a continuing threat to the best interest of all the public and to the existence of our form of govern ment . " Certainly this is a fresh inter pretation of the meaning of democracy in America . According to the text , our Timber Firm Head is talking to a Logging . Congress and urging it to take some vigorous concerted action . But then a log ging Congress does n't really represent any minority : its spokesman is a spokesman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American People . And if there seems to be a bit of local inconsistency at this point , blame it on that painful " swelling of the sacrum . " A NYWAY , this whole episode is something to make us I I all proud of the American way of free speech and free association . And you ca n't help thinking what a great idea it is some museums have , that instead of hav ? ing the public come to the museums , we ought to take all the strange creatures out of the museums and have them circulate freely among the public . That way it 's a lot more educational . And if any one does have a dinosaur handy , especially if it 's still alive and ambula ? tory , it ought to be taken around and shown to the ' school children , and at , service club luncheons , and at church socials , and the like . And everybody ought to have a good look at a monster which really belongs to the Mesozoic but has somehow managed to survive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
