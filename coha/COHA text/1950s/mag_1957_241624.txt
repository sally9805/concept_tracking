THE OLD MAN AND THE BOY ( 303 pp. ) - Robert Ruark-Holt ( $4.95 ) . <P> <P> " Once upon a time there was a large-eared , drip-nosed fugitive from multiplication and Sunday school ... He lived in the Victorian , gabled , ginger-bready house of his maternal grandpa , a sea captain with a bushy mustache . This man 's name was Edward Hall Adkins . The Negroes called him Cap'n Hawley and the white folks called him Ned Hall . Ned could shoot very fine and whittle very good and in his eyes a small boy was never never very wrong . " <P> These nostalgic lines from one of Robert Ruark 's columns a few years ago foreshadowed The Old Man and the Boy . With this book , 41-year-old Author Ruark ( Something of Value ) deserts Mau-Mau country for magnolia land . He has written a boozy-bucolic picture postcard reminiscence of his North Carolina boyhood . In Author Ruark 's memory-misted eyes the Old Man ( Ned Hall ) is a cross between Thoreau and Natty Bumppo , and the Boy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hemingway 's Nick Adams . Less affected readers may feel that they are merely reading the diary of a bad boy scout spending an endless hunting-and-fishing trip with a garrulous , overage camp counselor . <P> From this prose Noah 's ark aglut with fish and fowl , an olive branch of insight occasionally extends . The Old Man has a grave regional piety towards nature , and the Boy glows with a spontaneous , open-eyed wonder before it . The cycle of the seasons takes on a sensuous reality never suggested by the city-dweller 's falling calendar leaves . But Author Ruark 's major trouble is suggested by his title . Page after page of The Old Man and the Boy is mock-Hemingway in style and he-boy sentiments . Indeed , if Ernest Hemingway did not exist , it is difficult to see how Robert Ruark , man or boy , could ever have been invented .
