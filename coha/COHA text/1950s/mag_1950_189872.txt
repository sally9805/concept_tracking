As relentlessly as Inspector Javert dogged Jean Valjean , the Justice Department has dogged the steps of the Aluminum Co. of America . When Alcoa was acquitted of monopoly charges in 1941 , the trustbusters appealed their case . Four years later , an appeals court found that Alcoa had , indeed , been a monopoly before the war but it withheld judgment on Alcoa 's postwar status until all Government-owned aluminum plants were disposed of . <P> In the five years since that decision , Alcoa 's shrewd President Roy A. Hunt has done the best he could to build up competition . Hunt made available to the Government some of Alcoa 's key patents , thus paving the way for Reynolds Metals Co. and Henry Kaiser to buy and lease a majority of the war-built aluminum plants . But to Roy Hunt 's dismay , nothing he could do was enough to satisfy the trustbusters ; in 1948 they marched back into court to demand that Alcoa 's properties be carved up on the grounds that it still monopolized aluminum ingot production . Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win a round . In a 180-page decision , Manhattan 's Federal Judge John C. Knox refused to order Alcoa broken up . His reason : since 1947 , Alcoa 's share of the U.S. aluminum business had dropped from 60.6% to 54.5% while , in the same period , Reynolds ' share had increased from 24.8% to 26.7% and Kaiser 's from 14.6% to 18.8% , a combined total nearly as big as Alcoa 's . Judge Knox was so impressed by the growth of competition that he gave Alcoa permission to buy a surplus aluminum plant at Massena , N.Y . from the War Assets Administration , a deal that had been blocked up by protests from the trustbusters . <P> Judge Knox granted the trustbusters only one major point . It was dangerous , he ruled , for Alcoa 's stockholders , who control the world 's biggest aluminum company , also to dominate Canada 's Aluminium Ltd. , the second biggest . He ordered them to dispose of their holdings in one company or the other . He also left a loophole for the Justice Department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and the trustbusters can prov it , they may come back and try again to break up Alcoa . That was not much consolation for antitrust 's Javerts . <P> . . . <P> Undismayed , the trustbusters wound up to swing the sledge on General Electric Co . A year ago G.E . was found guilty of monopolizing the manufacture of incandescent lamps through control of patents and price fixing . Last week , Federal Judge Phillip Forman , at Trenton , N.J. , was considering the Government 's demand for a drastic penalty . Though G.E . ' s share of U.S. lamp production has declined from 82% in 1912 to 58% at present , the Government asked that G.E . : <P> Get rid of half of its lampmaking facilities . <P> Make its patents available to all other manufacturers . <P> Divest itself of any foreign holdings in which it has less than 100% of the capital stock . <P> Be barred from buying into any other lampmaking company , U.S. or foreign , or permitting G.E . officials to serve as directors .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
