For a good 20 years , Britons have looked on Sir Walter Moberly , principal of the new St. Catharine 's College at Windsor , as one of their top educators . In the last three years , they have also come to think of him as one of their top Christian philosophers . His Crisis in the University ( TIME , July 11 , 1949 ) was a bold attempt to restore a sense of unity to higher education by restoring its sense of Christian purpose . Last week Britons were grappling with Sir Walter 's latest work ( Responsibility ; Oxford University Press ) - an equally bold attempt to heal the split in society 's sense of moral judgment . <P> Moralist Moberly 's thesis , first spelled out in a series of lectures at the University of Durham , is based on the fact that there are two current conceptions of responsibility and hence of moral judgment . The lawyer-moralist has one idea . The psychologist has another . And society is torn between them . <P> Progress &; Poison . To the psychologist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " therapeutic rather than juridical ; the offender is to be regarded as a sick man to be healed rather than as a malefactor to be chastised . . . Ultimately then , all praise and blame are irrational . " Bernard Shaw put the moral , says Sir Walter , when he once suggested that a man should no more be punished for having an inefficient conscience than for having an inefficient lung . <P> But to this argument the lawyer-moralist has a stern retort . First of all , punishment is an administrative necessity-an indispensable safeguard of civilized society . More important , " to condemn and punish offenders , to insist on their responsibility ... is a phase of ... bracing strictness which has an irreplaceable educational value . . . With any individual , simply to accept his temperament and character as they are , and his impulses as they come , is death to moral progress . . . It is also disastrous to lead a delinquent to believe that he is more sinned against than sinning and to imply that strenuous moral effort on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c'est tout pardonner is poison here . " <P> Merit &; Demerit . Is the lawyer-moralist wholly right ? According to Sir Walter , he is in many ways as wrong as the psychologist . At their worst , courtroom judgments are nonmoral , stressing too much the deed and too little the doer , treating the offender simply as a nuisance that must be removed . At their best , they are sub-Christian . " They witness to a moral order which commands a deep respect . But they miss the supreme heights of human experience . . . for they leave room for no gospel and no salvation .. . "
