txt Dean Acheson , Secretary of State , told Congress today that the defense potentials of the free nations were more than enough to meet the threats of Communist aggression . He warned , however , that these potentials must be developed to their fullest speedily and with greatly accelerated aid by the United States . Secretary Acheson was testifying before an Appropriations subcommittee of the House of Representatives . This group is surveying President Truman 's urgent request for an additional $4,000,000,000 // for military aid to nations resisting communism at vital world points . Louis Johnson , Secretary of Defense , detailed the military and strategic importance of an immediate and tremendous expansion of the program . William C. Foster , acting Administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration , emphasized that a great military-production potential was available in Marshall Plan countries and , he said , it must be put to work immediately . The committee session was held behind closed doors . Some of the testimony was made public . Much if not most of it , it was indicated , was held off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , it had been thought $1,222,500,000 , plus the liquidation of some $400,000,000 of outstanding contracts , would carry the Mutual Defense Assistance Program through its second year . Now , as the program had suddenly jumped to what some in Congress described as the lendlease proportions of World War II , the extra $4,000,000,000 fund appeared to be assured , and soon . While committee members remained tight-lipped , it seemed that they were in a mood to give approval on these counts : that other free nations , in building up defense against Communist threats , would defend not only themselves but the security of the United States , and that military aid would go only to Reproduced with permission of the those countries that could use it effectively . Further , it was emphasized , military equipment and materials that were not released to " our friends , " as Secretary Acheson described the free nations , would be added to the strength of United States arms beyond the regular national defense program . Danger in Unpreparedness Noted With the Korean situation occu- ' pying the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military unpreparedness at other world spots would be " an open invitation " to further aggression . The best hope of peace , he added , lay in making it clear that acts of aggression would and could be resisted successfully . However , Mr. Acheson brought out , the program was dealing with military equipment that would remonths to two years quireto r reach six n na mass production . He echoed the appeal made by President Truman yesterday in asking formally for the additional $4,000 , - 000,000 . The Secretary called for fast Congressional action to get the orders to the producers . " A tank in Korea today , " he said by way of illustration , " is worth ' many tanks on the drawing board . " 1 Mr. Acheson told the subcommittee that the arms-aid program had shifted from a routine continuance stage to one of " initial phase " in a completely new drive . The $4,000,000,000 in new funds , he said , constituted only what was required for the present fiscal year . Some Congressional estimates have set the total , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To complete the program , Mr. Acheson said , would require drawing upon the resources of the entire free world . Steps , he said , were being taken to do that . Much of the $4,000,000,000 , Mr. potentials to reach full force . This , he added , would relieve stress and strain upon American manufacturers , who would be producing also for the regular national defense program . Mr. Foster testified that this program undoubtedly would call for drawing upon the economic resources of Western Germany . Such resources , he said , were as basic to the attainment of military strength as they were to the accomplishment of a healthy economic recovery in Europe . " This , " Mr. Foster added , " does not imply a revival of the German military production machine , but with its highly developed facilities for the production of non-combat items essential to the defense effort , and with increasing shortages bound to occur in steel and other basic elements that go into military production , Germany can certainly become an important factor in the common defense effort . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations will extend the fullest possible cooperation to this common effort , and we , for our part , can be content with no less effort than the situation requires . " The security of our country , land of the free world of which we are a part , will depend upon what we do now . " We face the need for a tremendous defense effort , to be undertaken with the utmost speed , and that need must be answered by each of use who bears a measure of responsibility for the future security of our country .
