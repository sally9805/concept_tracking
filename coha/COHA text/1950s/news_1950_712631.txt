txt American industry is wasting millions of dollars annually through poor housekeeping methods . But more and more arms are slashing plant maintenance costa with new machines and more efficient planning . How cheaply dm you sweep floors ? The Caterpillar Tractor Co. of Peoria . Ill. was paying as much as $10 per 1.000 square feet of floor space to have its factory swept manually . Then it bought three heavy duty sweeping machines from the G H. Tennant Co. of Minneapolis Now Caterpillar 's floors are cleaned at a cost of 50 cents per 1.000 square feet . One of these big vacuum cleaning machines looks something like a small lift truck and is guided about the factory by an operator riding atop it . A St. Louis appliance maker bought one for slightly less than 32.000 and was able to reduce his manual sweeping staff by 13 men . Cheaper Wall Washing Do you still wash walls by the sponge and pail method ? If so . you are missing a chance to clip the cost by ** So says the Quaker Maintenance Co Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ? ? Wallmaster . " This machine shoots a detergent through a hose to a cloth-covered trowel-like tool . which is moved over the surfaces to be cleaned . A similar trowel is used for drying and polishing the surface . The " Wallmaater 's " manufacturers say their contraption works equally well on painted and tiled walls . Or perhaps you are interested in reducing the cost of painting those wails . Hanlon &; Goodman Co. of Belleville . N. 3 is marketing a device which it says can clip at least oft labor time required by conventional methods of brush-painting . Crux of the firm 's " Stream-Flo " invention is a system for carrying paint through a hose , under pressure , to the brush . This provides a constant supply of paint , controllable at the brush handle . Priced at $25 , the " Stream-Flo " is usable with a variety of bristle section widths M. Robert Galle , inventor of the brush , says that in experiments at the Todd Shipyards , the paint losses were reduced up to 35% in pa.nting ship bottoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than spraying on a similar thickness of paint , and gives better protective covering . These machines and a host of others are attracting the attention of plant maintenance engineers , production officials ? and top-flight executives attending the Plant Maintenance Show and clinics which closed here yesterday While the waste from poor housekeeping has been going on for years , this was the flint time that such an industry wide conclave had been held . There was evidence that plenty of executives wanted to make up for this lost time . Some 10.000 of them jammed into , he show and clinics sponsored jointly by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Society for Advancement of Management . Planned Maintenance Pi eventive or planned maintenance  --  periodic inspection of machinery , pipelines , and other segments of an industrial plant to avert breakdowns  --  is becoming standard pi ocedure in more and more big plants , according to engineers at the convention . For example , R. M. Smart , division engineer of Sylvania Electric Products . Inc. , notes that planned , periodic replacement of light bulbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean savings in labor costs . He reasons this way . Labor cost for replacing 1,000 lamps individually as they burn out amounts to about 75 cents each , or $750 . But two men paid $25 a day each could replace the 1.000 lamps in four days , at a labor cost of $200 . If this were done every 5.000 hours , even though the rated lamp life is 7.500 hours , the loss in lamp life on a 70-cent lamp would total $233.10 . Then there would be another $37.50 loss for having to replace individually the 5% of lamps that would fail before 5.000 hours . Total cost of this " budget " plan would be $470.60 , compared with $750 for replacing the lamps as they burned out , or a saving through " planned maintenance " of $279.40 per 1,000 lamps . Sometimes additional maintenance savings can be made by merely concentrating facilities . A case in point is ; United Air Lines . United consolidated overhaul and maintenance points at fewer cities along its transcontinental route network . George E , Keck. superintendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the move amount to $1,267,000 . Back to the Factory , There are also savings to be made by sending some equipment items back to the factory tor repair , the experts at the show said . Take for example electric motors , a big expense in many maintenance budgets . T. E. Shogren , maintenance service salesman for the Westinghouse Electric Corp .. said that one Lake Erie iron ore dock has reduced its motor maintenance costs from 12 cents to threefourths of a cent per ton of ore handled by periodic inspections and returning the motors to the manufacturer for repair . Maintenance men at the show often differed on the best way of cutting plant upkeep costs . But most all agreed that top management is becoming more and more aware of the possibilities of cutting production costs this way . - James E. Sutherland , vice president of Bros . Inc. , management engineers , produced some rather startling estimates of the magnitude of plant upkeep costs . He noted that industry spent over $8,800 million on maintenance and repairs in 1948 , nearly $200 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double total annual earnings from 1935 through 1940 . The 1948 maintenance bill , he said , totaled more than the dividends paid to stockholders , Mr. Sutheiland 's statistics are a projection for all industry based on an exhaustive study of maintenance costs of 935 firms ranging from iron and steel mills to retail stores . More Gloomy 81111 C. C. Winston , senior staff engineer of another management engineering firm , Wallace Clark &; Co. of New York , takes an even gloomier view of the effect of high maintenance bills . He estimates that maintenance costs for many companies eat up an average of Ave cents of each net sales dollar : in some industries he thinks it reaches 10 cents . Mr. Winston believes , however , that well organized maintenance , plus rigid enforcement of the program , can reduce the over-all cost to one and one-half cents per net sales dollar . There were some 115 exhibitors at the show who offered materials , machines , tools and ldee ? designed to effect maintenance savings . Finnell Systems , Inc. of Elkhart . Ind .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a large model and $1.500 for a smaller one . This gadget dispenses its own water and cleaning agent , scrubs the floor and then squeegees it damp-dry . One operator handles the successive operations from a control panel , while guiding the machine around the fluor . Peoples Gas Building in Chicago cleans about 90,000 square feet of floor daily with three of the larger machines . It now takes six workers six hours to do the job : formerly it took 15 mappers ten hours to clean the building . Tools for maintaining fat tory facilities claimed lots of attention at the show . One of these is a portable saw , which can employ a variety of blades for cutting wood and metal . This device , manufactured by the R.C.S. Tool Corp . of Joliet , III. , is priced at 139.75 . The " Rammed " Another tool which got attention uses A powder cartridge to drive studs and large pins into masonry , wood ' or steel . Called the " Ramset " it can be used among other things to fasten electrical outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment to concrete , brick or cement block walls . Its makers , the Stemco Corp . of Cleveland , say that on one job it lopped $5b1 off the cost of driving 1,480 fasteners into a wall . Oster Manufacturing Co. of Cleveland offered a portable , power-driven , pipe-threading machine . The unit costs about $1 ' 00. and Oster claims that it pays for itself in about 33 days In savings on the labor bill alone . figuring the wage of a journeyman plumber at $2.25 an hour . Pittsburgh Corning Corp .. makers of glass block , wants the maintenance men to save by replacing parts of their buildings with its product . Pittsburgh Corning said it had just completed Installation of glass block paneling at the Brooklyn properties of New York Dry Dock Co .. replacing conventional window ? panes and sashes . This is cutting the heating load on the buildings by 40%. to 50%. according to Pittsburgh Corning . In addition . it reduces window washing costs and eliminates the need for painting sashes , the company stated . Valves used to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam in various industrial plants represent another maintenance expense . An innovation in this field exhibited at the show is a ball bearing valve developed by Carpenter Manufacturing Corp . of Cleveland . The company says the precision-ground balls in the stem , which fit snugly into the valve seat , make it the longest-wearing , leak , proof vale yet developed . Tests by one pro : spective customer using costly gases showed that it reduced gas losses by says the company .
