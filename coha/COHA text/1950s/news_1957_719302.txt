txt The Eisenhower Administration is preparing to put C. Douglas Dillon , Deputy Under Secretary lof State for Economic Affairs , in over-all charge of foreign aid programs . President Eisenhower is expected to issue soon an Executive Order that will give to Mr. Dillon supervisory authority over programs now administered by several agencies . As a kind of chief of staff for foreign economic affairs , Mr. Dillon will coordinate military aid and defense support programs , technical assistance , the new development loan fund , local currency loans from the sale of American farm surpluses and Export-Import Bank loans . Behind the decision to centralize the authority for these programs has been the growing Associated Press C. Douglas Dillon realization that they have often operated at cross purposes , to the detriment of an effective foreign policy . In short , the Administration has now come around to the view expressed last spring by the Senate Special Committee on Foreign Aid . The committee said : " Unless it is clear where foreign aid fits in total foreign policy and how each of the parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little likelihood that any design for the administration of foreign aid will achieve a high degree of effectiveness . " Thus , the Administration has a two-fold purpose in setting up an office to coordinate the foreign aid programs . First , it hopes that with the various aid programs tied together , it will be able to present to Congress a " more attractive package " when it defends its appropriation request . Second , it believes that coordination will make foreign aid a more effective handmaiden of foreign policy in the cold war . In the past there has often been a long period between the negotiating of a foreign aid agreement and putting it into effect . Officials here note that a day after a Soviet Union mission signs an aid agreement with an under-developed country , a plane load of engineers and technicians is likely to arrive on the scene . Officials here point out that this is because the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade works closely ' with the foreign office . The practical effect of the President 's order will be to I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " agency than it has been previously . John Foster Dulles , Secretary of State , has steadily resisted all proposals to have the State Department take on operating functions . It has been his contention that the department 's primary function should be its only function  --  to formulate policy . It is not known whether Mr. Dulles has modified his views or whether his objections have been overruled . Nixon Role Cited It is understood , however , that Vice President Richard M. Nixon , who has closely observed foreign aid operations in his travels abroad and who is sensitive to Senate sentiment , has played a large part in the decision to make Mr. Dillon a foreign aid coordinator . Mr. Dillon is well equipped by training and sympathies for his new job . Mr. Dillon , an investment banker , was chairman of Dillon Read &; Co. , Inc . He long has been interested in politics and foreign affairs . During the 1952 campaign he was on a speech-writing team led by ? Mr. Dulles . In 1953 , the President made him Ambassador to France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last January to take his present position . He is a stanch advocate of the foreign- aid program . He is also a friend of James H. Smith Jr. , who took over the head of the International Cooperation Administration a month ago . In Mr. Smit14 , Mr. Dillon will have a colleague much more sympathetic to foreign aid ? and especially development aid ? than was the last I. C. A. director , John B. Hollister . The Administration intends to go beyond the concentration of aid actvities in Washington . It will also concentrate all forms of aid in the field , placing the responsibility in the hands of the Ambassador where the Ambassador is " strong , " and in the hands of a competent economic counselor where the Ambassador is not equipped for the task . Early in the new session , the Administration will also propose to Congress that the new Development Loan Fund be made a Government corporation . The director of the fund would become the director of the corporation . Dempster , Ambassador to Venezuela , will be appointed director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His appointment must be confirmed by the Senate aftet Congress convenes . The Special Senate Committee on Foreign Aid also had recommended that control of the development fund be vested in a corporation . But the Inter- national Cooperation Administration had opposed the idea of giving an autonomous agency full control of development aid . The Administration now believes , however , that Congress is more likely to appropriate ' money for a Government corporation than for the fund that is within the I. C. A. This year the Administration asked for $500,000,000 for the first year of the fund 's operation and $750,000,000 for each of the next two years . Congress appropriated $300,000,000 thr this fiscal year and authorized $625,000,000 for the fiscal year , beginning next July 1 . The Administration would like to ask for a restoration of the original request . But believing that Congress would not appropriate $1,500,000,000 , it plans now to ask only for the$625,000,000 authorized . Under present plans the A ministration will not renew As proposal of last year for puting appropriations for military aid in the Defense Department budget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Committee on Foreign Aid . However , the Defente De-1 partment campaigned against it among members of the appropriations subcommittee han-1 dling the defense budget , and the proposal was killed . The Ad-1 ministration believes the idea would get no further this year . Over-all , the Administration is expected to ask for appropriations roughly equal to this year 's request of $4,000,600,000 . Of this $3,386,000,000 was new money , and $6141,600,000 was reappropriations . Congress finally cut this by $565,630,000 . The division between military and economic aid is also expected to be roughly the same as this year .
