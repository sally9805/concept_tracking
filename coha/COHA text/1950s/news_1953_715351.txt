txt President Eisenhower declared today that the Administration was working desperately to bring the nation 's expenditures within manageable proportions because deficit spending was having a very bad ' effect on the whole economy . This observation of the total Administration effort to reduce Government spending came in reply to a news conference question on Defense Department efforts to reduce military costs . President Eisenhower said that if Charles E. Wilson , Secretary of Defense , felt he could dispense with1 some element of military force without hurting the combat strength in Korea , he would be justified in making such a recommendation . No such recommendation has come to him , however , the President reported . The question was whether it was true that Mr. Wilson desired to reduce the strength of the armed forces , approximately 3,500,000 men , by 10 per cent and reduce the six divisions in this country by as much as 50 per cent . The Washington Post had reported today that this was a proposal being discussed by Mr. Wilson with Pentagon military officials . Sees No Conflict The questioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was any conflict between Secretary Wilson and the President , who last week said he would not reduce the level of this country 's military power . The President said he knew of no such conflict , and he met with Mr. Wilson several times a week . He went on to say that of course possible reductions had been talked over because they were trying to get the expenditures of the United . States within manageable proportions . It was quite clear , the President declared , that a continuation of deficit spending had a very bad effect on the whole economy , The // Administration was working desperately to economize and any recommendation that would not hurt the force in Korea would be welcome , he said . President Eisenhower also declared his position on these issues : CHe disapproved of high-ranking officials accumulating leave for terminal pay . Members of the Cabinet of former President Harry S. Truman and other officials collected more than 5700,000 for leave they had not taken while in office . CIle implied he would expect C. Wesley Roberts , Republican National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its lobby investigation that his conduct had been improper . cHe will send to Congress soon his previously announced recommendation for a commission that would study Federal-State relationships to reduce or eliminate duplicating taxes and welfare and security programs . QWhile the Bricker Resolution for a constitutional amendment to limit the President 's treaty-making powers was well intentioned , it would hamper the President 's authority to manage foreign policy . CHis Committee on the Reorganization of the Executive Branch of the Government was seeking a plan that might eliminate the competition of the Army Engineers and the Interior Department 's ( , control of Reclamation in water ' control and development projects . The President said he was sorry he had not talked to his own Cabinet specifically about the accumulated leave question . His personal philosophy about high positions was that a Cabinet official , no more than he himself , should not let down his responsibilities , even ' if he went off for a few days of recreation . The point President Eisenhower made was that high-ranking officials who went away for recreation were still responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unable to take full annual vacations he would not ? tolerate that as a claim for pay for the ' unused portion . The President made it clear , however , that annual leave was necessary for the great body of civil servants , that they had earned it , deserved it , needed it for efficiency and should be paid for untaken leave . An Appropriations subcommittee of the House of Representatives , which recently looked into the situation , reported that 215 Government employes , including some Truman Cabinet members , had collected $709,538 for accrued leave . Walter J. Connelly , former United States High Commissioner in Germany , received $12,560 . Charles F , Brannan , former Secretary of Agriculture , who received $3,933 , commented that he had been paid less than half of what he was entitled to because of a regulation limiting terminal leave pay to no more than ninety days . While members of the Civil Service Commission stated that the payments were justified by law , the subcommittee contended that they were made under a ruling that violated the intent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pondering whether Mr. Roberts violated the state antilobbying law when he accepted an $11,000 fee in helping to arrange the sale of a tubercular sanitarium for $110,000 to the state . The building was erected on state property twenty-five years ago by a fraternal insurance company , but Harold R. Fatzer , State Attorney General , contends the building under the ' original contract terms automatically reverted to state ownership without cost . Asked if the status of the Republican chairman had changed in his mind , President Eisenhower said he was earnestly hopeful that every important Government and party post could be occupied by men whose integrity and straightforwardness would be almost a byword in the nation . He had not known Mr. Roberts long but he had a great admiration for him , he declared . He had great faith in the Kansas Legislature and courts , the President continued , and he would not make up his mind until the facts were in . All his life he had tried to resist finding a man guilty of something merely because of an =substantiated charge , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfit for public office , then he , the President , did not intend to defend him for that office . How He Picks Aides The President further expressed his philosophy on public servants in commenting on his recent selection . of Albert M. Cole as Housing Administrator  --  a man accused in some quarters as an opponent of public housing . President Eisenhower said he called in a prospective officeholder , asked him about his philosophy , whether he was biased or distinctly in favor of some doctrinal idea , and whether he could operate according to the facts and under the law . He tried to get men who were logically devoted to the service and who generally conformed to his middle-of-the-road philosophy . And he did not like extremists of any kind , the President concluded , particularly those who made up their minds before they knew the facts . In reiterating his opposition to the Bricker Resolution , President Eisenhower said he had been advised by John Foster Dulles , Secretary of State , that it would in certain ways restrict Presidential ' authority to conduct foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ohio , the sponsor , replied that Secretary Dulles had warned that treaties " can cut across the rights given the people by the Constitutional Bill of Rights . " " To prevent any such result , " Senator Bricker continued , " the Senate is willing to restrict its own authority in the field of foreign affairs . I do not understand the President 's reported reluctance to accept a comparable restriction on his power , especially in view of the fact that the 1952 platform of the Republican party contains the pledge to make no treaty or agreement which would undermine the constitutional rights of the American people . " Last Peek the President said that the resolution was seeking to enact restrictions that were already defined ' M the Constitution . In recent years statements have been made in Congress that the Army Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation were duplicating some functions , but efforts to merge them had failed . Asked his view , the President said the reorganization committee was studying the matter and , while the engineers had a long record of efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations competing in the field of water control projects . He viewed the problem as a complicated one and therefore he said a proposed solution might not come early .
