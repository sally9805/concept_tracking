txt The Democratic Advisory Council today attacked the economical policies of the Eisenhower Administration and warned that depression might lie ahead unless they were changed . At the same time the committee issued a cautious call for " renewed consideration " by Congress of the party-splitting issue of civil rights legislation , if and when the leadership of Congress deemed it advisable to take the matter up again . Thirteen of the council 's twenty-four members were on hand today to conclude two days of meetings on major issues confronting the nation . The council , an advisory arm of the national committee , includes former President Harry S. Truman , Adlai E. Stevenson and Governor Harriman of , New York . Invitations to membership were spurned by such Congressional Democrats as Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , Senate majority leader and Sam Rayburn of Texas , House Speaker .

" The council said that the Administration had not only failed to meet the challenge of growing recession , but had failed to encourage the necessary economic growth and expansion to absorb the steadily growing numbers of workers . " There was never a ' time when such employment was more easily-provided than now , " it said , " for there never was a time when there were so many urgent tasks . Defense needs , aid to our allies and friends abroad , research , health facilities , highways and other civilian requirements are all urgent .

Rights Action Is Urged On civil rights , a subject on which the Democratic party is sharply split along regional lines , eleven of the Advisory Council members present today called for " renewed consideration " of legislation to protect rights in addition to voting . A bill restricted principally to voting rights passed Congress after long debate last year . " The council believes , " its statement said , " that , now that procedures ha ? - : been established for the protection of voting rights , the Congress should give renewed consideration to the extension of protection to all the others . " An indication that even this mildly worded statement might bring further dissension to the party was evident in the dissenting votes of two advisory council members , and in the conflicting interpretations given by two of those who voted for it .

Both the Administration and Democratic leaders in Congress have indicated that there will be no further action on civil Eights in the current session .
