Being a music critic and a composer at the same time is a little like playing quarterback and simultaneously having to blow the referee 's whistle . But Composer-Critic Virgil Thomson has long managed to write his own music and blow the whistle on the music of others without missing a play . Whether he was reporting on the nuances in a symphony performance , " discovering " a debutante performer , delivering an essay on one of the intricacies of composition itself , or unabashedly plugging his own works , he hardly ever bored a reader . Last week , after 14 years of what he calls a " honeymoon " with New York 's Herald Tribune , waspish Virgil Thomson , 57 , announced that he was " tired of listening to music , " was quitting to do more composing , lecturing and conducting . <P> Musician by inclination and wit by trade , Kansas City-born Virgil Thomson studied music in Paris ( after Harvard ) , was an organist , choirmaster and freelance writer on music before he went to the Herald Tribune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very first column , a deft and devastating panning of the sacrosanct Philharmonic-Symphony ( " the sombre and spiritless sonority of a German military band " ) . Thereafter , he shaded old-style critics by his saucy phrases , e.g. , hearing Violinist Jascha Heifetz overpower a sonatina " made one feel . . . that one had somehow got on the Queen Mary to go to Brooklyn . " His compliments were apt to be delivered off his backhand : one composer , he said , " wrote Mexican music ... in the best Parisian syntax . No Indians around and no illiteracy . " <P> Says Thomson : " Unusual works have more news value than Toscanini . The history of music is the history of composition , not performance . There is great validity in the constant performance of classical music , but the real news is deviation from the routine . For instance , I might be very fond of roast beef , but as food editor , I would find it exceedingly difficult to write very many interesting articles about the taste of roast beef . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to French music , and his own scores ( Louisiana Story , Four Saints in Three Acts ) resemble it in their neatness , transparent textures and often , inconsequence . His departure leaves a gap in the ranks of U.S. music journalism : there is now no practicing musician in its top ranks , no dedicated champion of modern U.S. composers . His post on the Trib will be filled by Columbia University 's Budapest-born Music-Historian Paul Henry Lang , author of the scholarly , 1043-page Music in Western Civilization . Quips one friend : " He thinks music ceased to exist at the death of Schubert . "
