Wladyslaw Plywacki , 24 , had passed all his tests for U.S. citizenship with flying colors . Imprisoned for five years by the Nazis in his native Poland before he es caped to the U.S. , he had served a hitch in Japan for his adopted country . He was an Air Force corporal stationed at Hickam Field , Honolulu when he came up before Federal Judge J. Frank McLaughlin to take the official oath and become an American : <P> <P> " I hereby declare , on oath , that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince , potentate , state or sovereignty . . . that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America . . . and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion ... " But here Corporal Plywacki boggled . The next words were " So help me God . " Wladyslaw Plywacki explained that he was an atheist , therefore could not in honesty use those words . <P> Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . " What does it say on the back ? " he demanded . When Plywacki had read the legend , " In God We Trust , " Judge McLaughlin made a little speech . <P> " Our Government is founded on a belief in God . You are asking for the privilege of being part of the Government , but you are apparently seeking admission on your own terms . If you are not willing to take the oath in good faith , the oath prescribed by the Congress of the United States , I can not grant your petition . " <P> The court immigration officer , surprised that the judge had not merely substituted an affirmation of allegiance permitted for those who object to oath-taking , suggested that , since Plywacki was about to leave for the States , the whole matter could be settled on the mainland . But Judge McLaughlin , a Roman Catholic , had his principles , too . He ruled Plywacki ineligible for citizenship . <P> Plywacki appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals in San Francisco . His argument : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion , which would include the right not to believe in God , then a petitioner for naturalization has the same right . " Last week the Justice Department in Washington told its office in Honolulu to " confess error , " indicating that it would not support Judge McLaughlin 's ruling in the appeals court . But Immigration Service lawyers have so far been unable to find a single direct precedent for a case like Plywacki 's , and there remains the possibility that the court will be required to make a historic decision . <P> Judge McLaughlin , meanwhile , is sticking to his spiritual guns . " I appreciate the right of a person to be an atheist , " he says . " But if you join an organization that has principles based on the existence of a Supreme Being-from the Declaration of Independence on down to the latest pronouncements by President Eisenhower on the importance of religion-you must abide by the rules of that organization .
