On the shaky scaffolding of Italian politics , Premier Alcide de Gasperi worked warily to mortar together a new government for Italy , his eighth since the war . He could no longer count on the three small parties of his coalition to help carry the hod . Two were so hurt by the June elections that they barely counted any more , and the Democratic Socialists of Giuseppe Saragat , cut down to 19 seats , decided to quit the team . <P> The Premier 's Christian Democrats lacked a majority in the Chamber of Deputies . But he knew that to form a democratic cabinet he was going to have to go it alone with the Christian Democrats , and trust that some of those who did not like it would be patriotic enough to refrain from voting against it when chaos was the only alternative . <P> " Man to Man . " De Gasperi took his time . First , he went through the formality of inviting all party leaders to his office in the Viminale Palace , where he could chat with men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chamber of Deputies . Communist Boss Palmiro Togliatti ( 143 seats ) came first - he had not sat down with De Gasperi since the day in 1947 when De Gasperi threw the Reds out of his coalition . " We talked man to man . " said De Gasperi later , but Togliatti kept " avoiding clarity . " Achille Lauro , leader of the Monarchists ( 40 seats ) , was equally vague . How did he propose to restore a king to Italy ? Lauro did not know . The leaders of the Neo-Fascists ( 29 seats ) came equipped with " more sentiment than ideas . " They talked of Trieste , reported De Gasperi , " in the friendly way all Italians talk about Trieste . " <P> With Pietro Nenni , clever leader of the fellow-traveling Socialists ( 75 seats ) , De Gasperi had his longest talk . The two spoke with the intimate second-person " tu " a reminder of the days they spent together as wartime anti-Fascist refugees in the Vatican . Of course , said Nenni , he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was it necessary to show such " excessive zeal " in promoting it ? De Gasperi asked if Nenni 's Socialists are really as independent of Togliatti 's Reds as they profess . Replied Nenni frankly : if the Communists were to take power in Italy , the Socialists would " regard it serenely. "
