txt More than 3,000 photografers , amateurs and professionals , assembled last night before the vast facade of the Science museum which was to be illuminated at 9:15 by an unprecedented battery of 1,000 large flashbulbs . A contingent of nearly 100 photografers from newspapers , newsreels , magazines , and television stations occupied a point of vantage atop the Windermere East hotel , facing the museum . Announcements flowed from a loud speaker system giving the photografers minute instructions on what F stops to use , with or without filters . They were told to leave their shutters open as the zero second approached . Streets Closed to Traffic Traffic , meanwhile , had been barred from streets near the museum both as a safety measure and to keep lights of automobiles from interfering with the picture taking . Twenty seconds before the 1,000 bulbs were scheduled to be touched off the announcer began counting , in reverse , as is done when an atomic bomb is to be exploded . When the count reached 10 thousands of shutters clicked open audibly . The count continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the count of 1 the bulbs were set off . To the naked eye the flash of the 1,000 bulbs was disappointing . They seemed to cast no more illumination than a 100th of that number , lighting the building , it appeared , feebly and unspectacularly . Different to Camera 's Eye But to the camera 's eye , the illumination was sufficient to record on the waiting film an outstanding night time portrait of the sprawling structure . Robert L. , THE TRIBUNE 'S camera editor , said that the incident scored an interesting photograf ic " first " on two counts : The first time amateurs have had a chance . to , participate in such a large scale flash project , and the first time they have been offered a fireworks display planned - for photografic effect rather than spectator enjoyment . The project was.a cooperative effort of the museum and the Sylvania Electric company , whose engineers , in charge of technical aspects ; estimated that the light produced by the 1,000 bulbs was equal to that of almost 2 million ordinary 60 watt incandescent light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
