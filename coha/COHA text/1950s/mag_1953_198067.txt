Paul Badura-Skoda 's music had been spinning off phonographs for two years before he decided to take a personal whirl at a U.S. concert tour . Last week , after performances in 16 other cities , the young ( 25 ) Viennese pianist made his Manhattan debut . <P> The audience came close to breaking all records for a debut ; some 1,500 listeners crowded into Town Hall . Most of them were there because they had heard some of the pianist 's 26 recordings ( Westminster ) of classical concertos , sonatas and ensemble music . Badura-Skoda gave them some honest , sensitive musicmaking , too conscious of European piano traditions to be very exciting , but with passages of rare expressiveness . His performance was well above the average of the so-odd novices who bow every year . <P> Badura-Skoda began playing the piano when he was six , but almost decided on a career in mathematics and physics before he heard famed Pianist Edwin Fischer play eight years later .
