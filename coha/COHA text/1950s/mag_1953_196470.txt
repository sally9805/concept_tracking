Under a bright California sky last week , some 500 fruit growers , packers and distributors gathered in the small town of Corona near Los Angeles to have lunch , dedicate a new building , and listen to some statistics . The building was an $800,000 freezing plant and warehouse built to store more than 1,250,000 cases of Sunkist Growers , Inc. ' s newest product : Sunkist frozen lemonade concentrate . The statistics were even more impressive : since introducing its frozen lemonade concentrate in 1950 , Sunkist has boosted sales 5,000% : 7.000,000 cases in fiscal 1953 and 10 million expected in 1954 . <P> For the growers at Corona , the success of Sunkist 's new lemonade concentrate meant more vitamins for the growth of the world 's largest food cooperative . Since 1893 , when a few growers took the name " Southern California Fruit Exchange " and joined forces to market their crop , the co-op has blossomed into a huge pyramid with a base of 14,000 growers and an apex of hired managers who run the business . Not many of Sunkist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together they market about 75% of all the citrus fruit in California and Arizona-28,600,000 boxes of lemons , oranges and grapefruit each year-and run a $500 million business . After all expenses in its ' 51-52 season , Sunkist returned to growers a total of $167 million , and the co-op expects an increase of up to 20% when the figures are in for the fiscal year just ended . <P> A typical grower at last week 's dedication was Paul R. Daggs , a spare , twinkling-eyed man who lives in Upland , Calif , and has 25 acres of lemons and oranges a few miles outside town . After Daggs sprays , irrigates and fertilizes his fruits , the co-op will pick , sort , grade and market about 16,000 boxes of oranges and lemons for him . They should bring approximately $150,000 on the market and , after all expenses , leave Daggs with a $15,000 profit for his year 's work . Daggs sometimes complains about the heavy pyramid over his head , but he would n't market any other way . Says Grower Daggs : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddha &; the Lemons . The man who carries most of the weight of the organization is a heavy-set grower named Paul S. Armstrong . 61 , who looks like a benevolent Buddha . As general manager of Sunkist Growers , Inc. since 1931 , Armstrong has the job of coordinating 175 little packing associations , each with its own packing plant , setting advertising and research policies , and devising new citrus products .
