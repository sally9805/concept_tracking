txt A Democratic Congressman came away from a conversation with President Truman and said that the President , against his own personal inclinations , would run for another term if he thought that in that way he could serve world peace . In other words , there might arise conditions in which the President would consider his continuance in office so indispensable to successful foreign policy that he would feel it a dereliction of duty not to run . Here is an administration whose foreign policy certainly has not been a brilliant success . A great many people question its basic conception and a great many more question its administration . It is doubtful if more than a handful could sincerely defend the foreign policy as a whole . One of the obvious sources of weakness is that the administrators of the policy are the prisoners of their own past mistakes . One of the examples is China . It hardly needs demonstration that there was a series of misjudgments . Yet the men who made these judgments can not say they were wrong . They must deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they had been right . Yet President Truman is represented by a friendly Congressman as believing that there might be circumstances where foreign policy in other hands  --  even in the hands of one of his own party ? would be a calamity . The President is probably sincere about this in the first place . In the second place , he acts no differently than would a great many other men in his position . Men go into positions of power humbly ; President Truman said that a million men in the United States were as capable as he of being President . But the longer they wield power , the more convinced they grow that the power should not be passed to the hands of others . Even when they are able to hand pick their successors , as Theodore Roosevelt did , they have doubts as to tfie ability of these successors . The truth is that the most capiible political regimes grow old and tired . Almost inevitably the barnacles of corruption attach to it . Its sole aim becomes to hang onto power and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , can face the tasks at hand . One of the wisest legislative measures in our time was the amendment to limit a President to two terms .
