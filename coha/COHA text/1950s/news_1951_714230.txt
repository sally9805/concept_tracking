Senate-House Conferees agreed today on a slightly revised tax-increase bill that would produce an estimated $5,691,000,000 in new annual revenue , and the Senate promptly approved it by voice vote . The final outcome remained in doubt , with House of Representatives action scheduled for tomorrow . Democratic leaders made qualified , predictions of passage but conceded that the vote would be close . House acceptance of the new bill would send it to the President and remove the principal barrier to adjournment Saturday .

Rounding off fractions in the proposed new rates resulted in an 11% per cent increase in the first two brackets instead of 11% . ? The conferees retained the 11% per cent yardstick for income above $4,000 after exemptions and deductions . Also retained was a special 9 per cent levy on taxable income after deduction of present liabilities for persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The revision entailed the annual lOss of about $68,000,000 in ' pritisPective hew revenue as compared with the rejected bill .
