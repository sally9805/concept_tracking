Further Economy Urged By PAUL CROWELL The city 's upstate water storage reservoirs held 103,348,000,000 gallons at 8 A. M. yesterday , or 40,8 per cent of total capacity . The increase of 1,165,000,000 gallons , over the 102,183,000,000 gallons on , hand at 8 A. M. Friday was caused mainly by the run-off from intermittent light rains in the watershed areas . Edward J. Clark , chief engineer of the bureau of water supply in the Department of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , estimated at 550,000,000 gallons the eventual run-off in the upstate reservoir districts . This would be less than a single day 's supply for the city . Mr. Clark pointed out that the increase of the storage supply to 40.8 per cent of capacity , as the result of voluntary conservation of water ana the slight rainfalls in recent weeks , was encouraging but left a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noted " All you have to do , " he said , " is look at the figures .

The estimated run-off at Sohoharie was 20,000,000 gallons , with 360,000,000 gallons estimated for Esopus and 170,000,000 gallons for Croton . Clearing weather over the three watershed areas held little promise for additional run-offs over the Neek-end .
