It was time for the British to pull out of the Suez again . <P> The second going seemed even more painful than the first last June . Determined to minimize final leavetaking , the British and French dragged their feet on Port Said 's waterfront , and overstayed their appointed departure time by at least two days . Bit by grudging bit , they inched back from the canal highway , from the airfield , from the battered city itself , until at last they had handed over all authority to the Swedes , Danes and Norwegians of the U.N . Expeditionary Force . Then the last thousand " beachhead " troops ended the 48-day occupation and marched aboard the ships that had been waiting for them all the time . <P> With carrier planes circling overhead and ten destroyers guarding their flanks , they sailed slowly north out of the wreck-cluttered harbor and faded into the wintry Mediterranean dusk . The troops themselves were glad to go : it had not been pleasant duty on their sector , crowded in by Egyptians stirred by inflammatory propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way on one big Suez question , they were busily negotiating with the U.N . ' s Dag Hammarskjold on a second : the clearing of the canal . The British wanted the U.N . to use the British 20-ship salvage fleet to clear the remaining 13 wrecks in Port Said harbor , and to help remove wrecks lodged farther south in the canal . The U.N . wanted these ships , especially six lifting craft , but the sticking point was their crews . Nasser refused to contemplate British and French sailors ' sailing up and down the canal . <P> Elementary Values . Contrary to the impassioned feelings of Tory backbenchers , the British Foreign Office decided that there was no use in trying to bludgeon Nasser into making concessions : he had to be brought around slowly and carefully by the U.N . and the U.S. In the midst of the negotiations , blustery First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Hailsham , visiting Port Said , blurted out that no British ships could be employed without British crews . This provoked Nasser and his Foreign Minister into rejecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Commons , Foreign Minister Selwyn Lloyd addressed an implied rebuke to the First Lord of the Admiralty : " I think it would be very much better , " said Lloyd , " if this were dealt with on a technical basis . " <P> Taken up technically , the matter proved solvable . The Anglo-French salvage fleet would keep working in the Port Said harbor after the troops left . The ships would be turned over to the U.N. , operate under the U.N . flag . Royal Navy officers and men would don civilian clothes " down to cuff links , " and all wear U.N . arm bands . The ships would dismantle all guns ( a good thing , gruffed Lord Hailsham , " there 's nobody there I 'd particularly want to salute " ) . <P> Civilianizing . " What a way to treat the navy ! " cried London 's jingoist tabloid Daily Sketch . A Daily Mail cartoon showed Admiral Nelson atop his Trafalgar Square roost dressed in top hat , striped trousers and cutaway coat . But Tory anger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperate or go on cutting off the flow of its lifeblood oil at Suez . Lord Hailsham , quieter in London than he was in Port Said , said : " We will civilianize the whole fleet if necessary . "
