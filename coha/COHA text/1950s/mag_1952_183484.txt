Many people whose doctors tell them that they have something the matter with their hearts have nothing of the sort . That is the conclusion of three Manhattan physicians , headed by Dr. Leonard J. Goldwater , after a ten-year study of hundreds of " heart cases " sent to them by the New York State Employment Service , which wanted to find out what kind of work was suitable for its " handicapped " clients . <P> The three doctors worked in a special clinic set up at Bellevue Hospital . They took their time-unlike many of the doctors who had diagnosed the patients originally . Among 631 cases , 175 ( or 28% ) were found to have no heart disease at all . ( All but 19 had been told that they had ; the 19 had misdiagnosed themselves . ) The biggest group of wrong diagnoses ( 38 ) had been made by draft doctors at induction centers , but private and school physicians , hospital clinics , insurance examiners and industrial physicians all contributed to the total of bad guesses . <P> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonest stumble was a " functional " ( i.e. , not organic ) heart murmur , of a type which Dr. Goldwater describes as " transitory , innocent . " Sometimes they were misled by high blood pressure . Other errors were more surprising : tuberculosis , cancer of the stomach and latent syphilis were all mistaken for heart trouble . <P> In 56 cases , doctors had advised the patients to take it easy ; in some instances they had gone so far as to recommend quitting a job or turning down a new one . But the perversity of human nature is evident in the Goldwater report : only 19 of the 56 took the doctor 's advice , while seven who had not been told to cut down their activities did so anyway . <P> " When non-cardiac patients are advised to limit their activities , as a result of incorrect diagnosis , the result is calamitous , " say Dr. Goldwater and his colleagues . " Not only needless disability has been created , but irreparable psychic trauma also is often produced . . . Large numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military service . It seems particularly timely to point out again that what is designed to serve as a preventive measure may prove to be just the opposite . "
