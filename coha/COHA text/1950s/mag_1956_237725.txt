Days before the convention opened , the squire from Libertyville took up his pencil and began to scribble out a draft of his acceptance address . He got scores of unsolicited suggestions and memos . After reading them , he tossed them aside and continued on his own . All last week , even during intervals in the hectic Truman crisis , he returned time and again to the isolation of his small , green-tinted law office on Chicago 's South La Salle Street . There , shirt-sleeved and with tie askew , he revised , updated , rephrased and polished . On the convention 's last night Adlai Stevenson stood up before the Democratic delegates as their second-time standard bearer , accepted the nomination in a fighting speech studded with epigrams and clearly wrought phrases that brought applause from his audience 53 times . <P> Stevenson 's theme was the need of the Democratic Party to move beyond the New and Fair Deals and face up to the realities of a " new America " - a theme he frequently clouded with catchwords from his party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who " reminded us so movingly that this is 1956 and not 1932 ; not even 1952 ; that our problems alter as well as their solutions ; that change is the law of life , and that political parties ignore it at their peril . " There was also a nod to Harry Truman , the spirit of ' 48 : " I am glad to have you on my side again , sir . " <P> Borrowed Thunderbolts . With thunderbolts from Carlyle and Woodrow Wilson he blasted the Republicans from stem to stern . He did not propose , he said , to make " political capital out of the President 's illness . " But he attacked Eisenhower as a weak President " cynically coveted by the Republicans as a candidate but ignored as a leader . " In an oblique thrust at Nixon , he said that if he and Kefauver are elected " and it is God 's will that I do not serve my full four years , the people will have a new President they can trust . " <P> The men surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignity to the democratic process " : they seek to " merchandise candidates like breakfast cereal . " The result : " No Administration has ever before enjoyed such uncritical and enthusiastic support . " But has it used this opportunity " to elevate us ? To enlighten us ? To inspire us ? " The delegates answered with thunderous " noes . " The truth , he declared , is that not everybody at home is prosperous and that , despite what the President has said , our prestige abroad " has probably never been lower , " and " we are losing the cold war . " <P> Borrowed Terms . For one thing he was grateful , he said with irony . By a " minor miracle " the Republicans , " after twenty years of incessant damnation of the New Deal , " have finally " swallowed it , or most of it , and it looks as though they could keep it down at least until after election . " What , if elected , would Stevenson do ? He seemed to be of two minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leadership there would be stronger labor unions and more federal support for farmers , small businesses , power and water development , etc.
