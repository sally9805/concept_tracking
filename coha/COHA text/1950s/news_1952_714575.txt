txt ? Impellitteri and Moore to Hold Further Conferences Tempers flared in a special meeting of the Board of Estimate yesterday as members of the Democratic majority sharply criticized Council President Rudolph Halley for allegedly promoting an unworkable fiscal program and seeking to make political capital of the city 's financial woes . The hour-long acrimonious bate at City Hall came to a climax when Mr. Halley , returning verbal blow for verbal blow , demanded the board reject all the nuisance taxes made permissive by the Legislature in its $234,800,000 program for city financial aid . He said the city should go back to the Legislature with a demand for a " good " financial program . Mayor Impellitteri , who with Controller Lazarus Joseph clashed with Mr. Halley at many points , defended the new stop-gap financial set-up as " the best kind of a program that was made available to us . " Further Conferences Planned The Mayor disclosed that as soon as the 1952-53 expense budget was adopted , he and his fiscal aides would resume conferences with Lieut . Gov . Frank C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's financial ills ready for the next legislative session . Frequent conferences between the two officials here and in Albany during the winter hammered out the provisions for new taxes and debt refinancing that made up the stop-gap fiscal aid program . At yesterday 's Board of Estimate meeting , called to act on the extension to June 30 of the interim 10-cent fare for private bus companies , Controller Joseph held aloft a copy of Mr. Halley 's proposals for a city financial program , made public on March 15 , and argued that it was $144,000,000 out of balance . " There 's too much politics about this whole thing , " Mr. Joseph declared at one point . " I have no criticism of any man who wants to aspire to public office . I can not understand why any wants to be Mayor . It 's a tough , mean , thankless job . All of us mortals have ambition . It is the methods some people employ in trying to achieve it that sometimes get me unduly excited . " The spirited discussion brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a candidate for Mayor . Moreover , the Controller said he would not even run again for his present job . The Council President brought to a climax his denial of any present intent to run for Mayor with this declaration : " I do not want to be subject to the little compromises that are in a candidate 's heart . " Political Theme Renewed Despite these denials , the political theme cropped out again as the talk became more heated . At one point Mr. Halley said that when he was campaigning for the Council Presidency he said he would be a " watchdog " of city affairs . " You have n't done it , " the Controller shouted , shaking his finger at Mr. Halley . " You ca n't be a Commissioner of Investigation , a District Attorney , a President of the Council and an expert on crime all at one time and do a good job . " At another point Mr. Joseph , in an implied criticism of some of Mr. Halley 's recent statements , said : " I could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every appropriation and against every tax . But you do n't run a city that way . " The Mayor echoed the Controller 's view . Mr. Impellitteri and Mr. Halley came to grips on whether the city fiscal program presented to Albany was that of the entire Board of Estimate , or just of the Mayor . Arguing that the whole board had endorsed the program , Mr. Impellitteri said , in effect , that the Council President would be morally obligated now to vote for the slate of state-approved nuisance taxes that Mr. Halley had said he would oppose . " I said our tax program would have to be a Board of Estimate program , not a Mayor 's program , and you agreed , " Mr. Impellitteri ' said to Mr. Halley . " I did not , " Mr. Halley snapped . Then , puffing furiously at his cigarette , he added : " I am perfectly willing to argue with any one , two , three , four or five members of the Board of Estimate , publicly or privately , and at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over whether the city had reached its limit in economies . Mr. Impellitteri said that by saving $3,000.000 a month under its present budget by not filling vacancies and making operational economies , city departments were cutting costs to the bone . Mr. Halley reiterated that with greater efficiency and the elimination of wasteful practices the city could save $35,000,000 next fiscal year . Commenting on the city 's ap , proach to the Legislature for financial aid , Mr. Halley said this ' approach had been too much " hat in hand " and " not dramatic enough . " The Mayor 's original state aid and tax program , Mr. 1Halley said , " might have made , some sense . " He also conceded that Mr. Impellitteri had done " a good job " in presenting the city proposals . " But in Albany , logic apparently does not have much effect , " Mr. Halley asserted . " As a result of lour request , we got a batch of taxes that were apparently pushed off on us because they were obnoxious . If we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislature we wo n't take it . " Yesterday 's discussion on finances was touched off when Brooklyn Borough President John Cashmore said he thought there , was " some confusion in the minds ' of New Yorkers " about the fiscal program , and asked Mr. Joseph to review the board 's action . The half-hour answer the Controller gave was termed by Mr. Halley a " political speech . " Just before the session ended Manhattan Borough President Robert F. Wagner Jr . said he took exception to reported remarks of Governor Dewey last week-end that the city needed " brains " to be run properly . The Mayor said he had received a telephone call from Governor Dewey denying the Governor had made the statement . A recorded transcript of the pertinent excerpt from Mr. Dewey 's remarks made last Satlurday at the sixth annual New York Herald Tribune Forum for High Schools at the Hotel Astor was as follows : " And while we ( the state Administration ) did manage to help the City of New York out with all of the best brains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. new government from Albany . They 've got to run their own . "
