To Guatemala 's backlands , torn by bitter years of a Communist-written land reform that set peasant against landholder , last week came a quietly revolutionary reform of the reform . Going well beyond the vague notion that landless Indians " ought " to have some of the big estates held by a few families , President Carlos Castillo Armas ' decree aimed at raising the agricultural health of all Guatemala . <P> The reform begun in 1952 by Red-led President Jacobo Arbenz actually moved 87,000 peasant families onto plots of their own . Some legally took over uncultivated parts of confiscated estates ; more , inflamed by the example , simply seized land amid scenes of bloodshed and destruction . After Castillo Armas took power , many landlords grabbed back their holdings with equal violence . The bulk of the 1,950,000 indifferent , largely illiterate Indians stayed unbenefited on their subsistence corn patches high in the mountains . <P> The new law , written with the advice of U.S. farm experts , makes many changes . Recognizing that one good solution is to get the landless mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three crops of corn a year ) , it tempts them with homesteads at low prices . Recognizing also the popular demand for land redistribution , it provides for the well-compensated expropriation of idle parts of big estates and their division among the landless . The new plan offers technical assistance , credit , housing and " fundamental agrarian education " aimed at turning the withdrawn Indians into cash-crop farmers and cash-spending consumers . In contrast to the Arbenz regime 's land reform decree , which retained a lien on government-issued land ( to keep beneficiaries voting the right way ) , the new law gives outright possession . To prevent estate owners from buying their land right back , it forbids resale for 25 years without government consent . <P> Land reform will be financed as part of a fiveyear , $250 million economic development program announced by Castillo Armas last week as Guatemala put its new constitution and Congress into formal operation . The U.S. may supply a fifth of the total sum , has already contributed $2,400,000 toward land resettlement . But other land reform funds will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary part of the law . The tax applies to untilled parts of large farms , and increases by 25% every year - up to five years - that the land is left unproductive . Though low ( top rate : $1.25 per hectare - 2.47 acres - the first year ) , the tax strikes hard at the principle of holding land not for farming but as an inflation-proof investment .
