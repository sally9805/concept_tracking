Do n't Explain ( Jeri Southern ; Decca ) . One event in the he-she cycle that is very rarely explored in pop tunes : the philanderer 's return . Songstress Jeri Southern gives it a fairly heart-wrenching onceover in a plain but expressive voice , while in the background a baritone sax cries hoarsely . <P> Glenn Miller Army Air Force Band ( Victor 5 LPs ) . A whopping album of eye-misting nostalgia for any veteran of jitterbugging in Europe , short-waving in the Pacific , or lonely stargazing at home during World War II . The 57 numbers contain productions large and small of favorite tunes of the day , broadcast by one of the silkiest bands ever collected . <P> Heartbreak Hotel ( Elvis Presley ; Victor ) . A new singer with a new twist : a double voice that alternates between a high , unpleasant quaver , reminiscent of Johnnie Ray at his fiercest , and a rich basso that might be smooth if it were not for its spasmodic delivery . Heartbreak Hotel , yelps the high voice , is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answers the basso : he 'll be sorry . <P> Help Me ( Vic Damone ; Columbia ) . This title sounds as if it belonged to a screamer , but the tune turns out to be a rather pleasant and intimate plea : " Do n't just stand there and stare , help me . " Damone sells it smoothly right up to the end , where he ca n't resist peddling a raucous note . <P> The Hi-Lo 's Under Glass ( Starlite LP ) . Just about the most virtuoso vocal quartet on records , singing a dozen far-out arrangements of those oldies . Some of the music , e.g. , Through the Years , is strictly barbershop , of the brush-cut variety . More , e.g. , Birth of the Blues , I 'm Beginning to See the Light , has a beguiling touch of lunacy . <P> Mountain High , Valley Low ( Helen Merrill ; Mercury ) . A vaguely Oriental-sounding ditty that exudes a melancholy charm and makes little attempt to make sense , e.g. , " If you need me , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' <P> New Solos by an Old Master ( Joe Sullivan , piano ; Riverside LP ) . A Chicago jazzman of the old school plays old favorites , from I Cover the Waterfront to Gin Mill Blues , with a gentle fervor . <P> See You Later , Alligator ( Bill Haley ; Decca ) . Rock ' n ' roll rhythm in full cry , primitive to the point of idiocy . The title is warmed-over jive talk ; the response : " After a while , Crocodile . " <P> Take Your Time with Me , Lover ( Joyce Bradley ; Mercury ) . A voice of sanity in a live-for-tonight era . The gal pleading for a slower pace may be a dull date , but she 's the kind to make the right guy happy . <P> Tender Trap ( Pablo Beltran orchestra ; Victor ) . A high-swinging version of a low-swinging tune , recorded , of all places , in Mexico . The band sounds something like the old Lunceford band , with its happy-go-lucky saxes , its smooth trombones and its nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tutti Frutti ( Pat Boone ; Dot ) . Most of the lyrics are composed of the title phrases plus the syllables " aw rootie , " a tune written to . be sung by a virile but slack-jawed male . <P> What 's Right for You ( Lena Home ; Victor ) . Lena 's all aquiver about Topic A , agog with its possibilities , awash with its goodness . The tune is dressed up by some suggestive pianistic titters.
