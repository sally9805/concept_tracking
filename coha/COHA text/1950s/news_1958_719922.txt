txt President Eisenhower proposed today a major new move to strengthen the financial backing for world trade ? and world economic development . The President instructed Robert B. Anderson , Secretary of the Treasury , to support an increase in contributions , including dollar contributions , to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund . Mr. Anderson was told to propose such an increase at the annual meeting of the two institutions in October in New Delhi , India . General 4isenhower also told Mr. Anderson to begin negotiations looking toward the establishment of a new lending agency to be called the International Development Association . Letters Are Exchanged The announcement came in the form of an exchange of letters between the President and Mr. Anderson . The President said his program " would require intensified international cooperation directed to a broad attack upon some of the major economic problems of our time . " No figures were mentioned by the President or Mr. Ander-I Son . However , informed ' Spec- Ulation here , previously reported ; has centered on an increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and borrowing rights , of each of the sixty member- nations of the bank and the fund . Cost to U. S. Estimated For the United States this would mean an additional dollar contribution ' of $1,375,000 , - 000 to the monetary fund , probably to be spread over several years . It would mean a like addition to the present " standby " commitment to the World Bank , though no actual dollar expenditures . The bank raises its funds by floating bonds on the world 's money markets , chiefly in New York . The new International Development Association is still in such an embryonic stage that no figures for its initial capital have been worked out . Although the great majority of the members of the bank and fund are ' certain to applaud and back up with their own funds an increase for those two institutions , it is less certain that // they will want to join in the new development association . If they do not , it may never come into being . The key item in the proposal is the increase for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar contributions and the required additional contributions of other nations would add almost $3 , - 000,000,000 to the Fund 's reserves of " hard " currency , assuring a 50 per cent increase in quotas . The President said the money was not needed immediately but it soon would be , After a record two years of activity , in which loans from the Fund have prevented severe financial crises in a dozen key nations , its resources of gold and " hard " currencies are down to about $1,500,000,000 . The Fund is a sort of " pool " of currencies available for short-term loans to nations suffering a severe shortage of foreign exchange . During the decade of the Fund 's existence only United , ' States and Canadian dollars , plus the Deutsche mark and the British pound to a limited extent , have been usable for such loans . To cite one key example , it was a Monetary Fund loan of $531,000,000 and a standby commitment to supply $769,000,000 more to Britain at the time of the Suez crisis that largely prevented a widely feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the rescue of France , India , Japan , Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Turkey and others in its recent burst of activity . Without this aid , the nations involved would have been forced to curtail their imports drastically . This would have harmed both their own internal economies and the exports of their trading partners . Partly because of the Fund 's help , the web of exchange restrictions ' in the free world is gradually being reduced . In the case of the World Bank , the need for additional resources is somewhat less urgent . The problem is that the bank , in effect , can probably sell its own bonds only up to the limit of the " standby " backing of the United States Government . That limit is being approached , and an increase in this backing will enable the bank to continue its recently increased rate of activity . Two Main Reasons Noted Its loans , now mainly for development in the under-developed countries , have passed the $3,000,000,000 mark . It is understood that there were two main reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotas now : First , the finance ministers of . the British Commonwealth countries are due to meet the middle of next month at Montreal . Knowledge of the new United States move would tend to reassure them about the future of the necessary financial backing for expanded world trade and thus tend to ward off any moves in the sterling area countries to " turn inward " ? arrange devices for expanding their own trade to the exclusion of the rest of the world . Second , the annual meeting of the World Bank and Monetary Fund will take place in New Delhi , India , in early October . There has been much informed speculation about United States backing for increased quotas , but little official support for the speculation . The announcement gives the fifty-one member countries a chance to prepare their reactions in advance . Procedure is Outlined The present plan is to have the bank and Fund governors at New Delhi simply authorize the working executive poards of the two institutions to negotiate an increase in quotas . The details would be worked out during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a final plan for presentation to the next session of Congress , " though not necessarily in January . " The proposed new International Development Association is the result of a plan originally sponsored in Congress by Senator A. S. Mike Monroney , Democrat of Oklahoma . Late in the session the Senate adopted a resolution instructing the Administration to make a study of the plan . It has three main purposes . The first is to make " soft " loans , possibly in conjunction with the world bank 's " hard " loans . That is , the part financed by the development association would be repayable in local currencies at low rates of interest over a long term . By this device , the two institutions together could join in financing such a project as the Aswan High Dam in Egypt , which is too big for the country to finance by itself solely by " hard " loans . The second is to create a device by which the nations of West Europe , especially West Germany , could join in the huge task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European currencies are becoming " harder , " and thus more desirable , as each year . acses . The third is to find a device by which the United States might be able to use more of the foreign currencies it is acquiring by sales of farm surpluses and in other ways . The possibilities here , hdiVever , are regarded as very limited at best .
