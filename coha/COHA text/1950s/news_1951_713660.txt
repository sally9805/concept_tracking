txt Letters to The Times DALE DEWIn . New York , March 9 , 1951 . Letters to The Times Refuting Soviet Statements More Vigorous Expose of Propaganda Nature of Arguments is Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On each occasion when representatives of Russia present a highly condemnatory and argumentative viewpoint on the actions of Western nations there is a repetition of a technique so stereotyped and so transparent that it is astonishing that diplomats appear to treat it so gently . The obviousness of the fraudulent intellectual technique of the Communist representatives was , of course , most clearly apparent over the years of debate in the United Nations Security Council and Assembly . It was used again by the Chinese and more recently by the Russians in a note to Britain . Never has such absurdity of logic in high places been treated with so much dignity and tenderness by its victims . Never was such ridiculousness spared the ridicule it deserves . Apparently , in the face of it all , our representatives consider it sufficient to come back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " technique of Hitler , or an occasional challenge to permit inspection of what transpires behind the Iron Curtain . This is good . But it does not deal with the problem as thoroughly as is needed for public relations purposes . It is not known how many citizens of the United States believed the arguments of Russia and China when they were broadcast by radio and television . But as one who occasionally listened I longed to hear from some United States representative a devastating analysis of the fallacious trickery which was used . Instead , it seemed as if we were placed on the ' defensive when our replies were made in a vein too serious . Do we not have some debaters with facile tongues and sharp minds who could tear apart and regularly expose the cunning tricks of propaganda employed ? Hector , Secretary of State to Scotland , used to , do it for the British in the earlier days of the United Nations . What a loss that he is not out in front now . How he could ridicule such phrases as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that , " " Being unable to refute this proof , " namecalling techniques and practiced insults . The Russians and Chinese have imposed upon the freedom of this country to do what would not be permitted in their own . If we allow this , and of course we must , our Government could at least be less tender and treat less ponderously their propaganda techniques . These comments are not made to minimize the splendid statesmanship of such men as Mr. Austin and Mr. Jebb . But to this should be added more skillful public debating . Surely a more thoroughgoing treatment of the fraudulent arguments of the Communists would have strengthened public support for the effort in Korea . DALE DEWITT . New York , March 9 , 1951 . Naval Command Queried To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A great deal of anger has been aroused in Britain by the appointment of an American admiral as Supreme Naval Commander , N. A. T. 0 . But it is vitally important that every American should realize clearly that this anger is directed not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own Prime Minister for not proposing and pressing the appointment of a Briton . However , my purpose in writing is not to attack my Government but to stress that we must not allow any animosity to develop between our two countries because of this appointment . The Communists must be given no help by us in their efforts to weaken our friendship . It was right . and pleasing that America should be ready and willing to assume command , and we have no grumble against that . What angers us is that the Prime Minister hardly seemed to know or care that he had allowed a substantial part of the Royal Navy to be placed under the substantial control of a foreign nation and a foreign admiral . We know , too , that we are not lacking in experienced admirals . The Royal Navy leads the world in anti-submarine and mine-sweeping techniques , and it is precisely these spheres of warfare which will arise in the Atlantic . Politically , too , it is not desirable to have an American in each top position , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Commander , Land , but Britain can look after the seaways of the Atlantic . The Royal Navy and the people are willing  --  just give us the chance . But whatever happens we wish every success to Admiral Fechteler , and if he does assume command he can be sure of the Royal Navy 's loyal support . TERENcE J. DAVIES , Liphook , Hampshire , England , March 1 , 1951 . What Aid to India Implies To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The opportunity to supply a part of India 's necessities in grain is one to be especially welcomed , just because Mr. Nehru is independent of us in some of his major policies . In international affairs , as in others , hard-headed help is usually the best help . But there are occasions in which plain goodwill to a neighbor in trouble , freed from every note of political investment , is called for . Our dealing with the Boxer Indemnity was such an occasion : it created for us a long-lasting " reservoir of goodwill , " not as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is another such occasion  --  and they are rarer than one would think : a. chance to hold out a hand to a new nation , whose initial problems are tremendous at best , and whose leader we must regard as an able , conscientious and friendly critic . A deed of help at this time can be an assertion of American faith in the solidarity of men of goodwill under- . neath momentary differences , the only spirit in which the dissensions of men can ever be healed . It should be our pride to seize this opportunity promptly , gladly and liberally ; it is a chance to show what America really is . And there never was a time when it was Mote important to show ourselves to Asia in our true colors . WILLIAM ERNEST HOCKING . Madison , N. H. , March 11 , 1951 . Animals for . Science Legislation Making Pounds Available to Laboratories Protested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As participants during many years in efforts in this city to prevent cruelty to animals we write to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our State Legislature to change in large measure the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals into a society for the procurement and supply of animals for purposes of laboratory experimentation and , if necessary , for painful mutilation in the c : use of " science . " We refer to the Metcalf-Hatch bills now before both branches of our State Legislature . We feel that certain provisions of these bills are repugnant , by reason of the increased facilities they would provide for insufficiently controlled experimentation upon living animals , and especially upon dogs . We refer especially to the clause in the bills which provides that " notwithstanding the provisions of any other law , the Commissioner of Health of the State of New York . or the Commissioner of Health of the City of New York , if in New York City , may requisition * * unwanted or unclaimed animals which may be seized and impounded pursuant to law , " as great numbers of dogs , both strayed pets and others , are impounded annually by the A. S. P. C. A. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a few days ' detention , " if still unclaimed * * be allocated by the Commissioner for experimental use to institutions and laboratories approved under this article for such use , " and that " upon delivery of allocated animals Lhe receiving laboratory or institution shall reimburse the pound " ? in New York City the A. S. P. C. A. ? for . the maintenance of such animals in an amount to be determined by the Commissioner . Under another clause of these bills such experimentation may even be performed without effective anesthesia . And not only must such a society as the A. S. P. C. A. now surrender its wards for purposes that may be cruel in the extreme but it must also , and whether it choose to or not , accept reimbursement of its costs incurred in maintaining the unfortunate creatures until so surrendered . Although chartered by the state to prevent cruelty , it must now , under the next clause complained of , become a party to that which it would prevent . For this next clause to which we refer provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with physiologic function under study , all tests , experiments and investigations involving pain shall be performed under adequate anesthesia . " In a letter quoted in your issue of March 3 the State Health Commissioner , supporting the proposed legislation , appears to say : " Today , these laboratories experience difficulties in procuring an adequate supply of dogs and yet , at the same time , tens of thousands of animals are destroyed annually in New York pounds . " What chance will the strayed dogs of New York have if the supervision of the operation of the proposed law be in the hands of Commissioners at least the senior of who 's appears to have so little consideration for them ? LETTICE S. PHELPS STOKES . 1 . S , PHELPS STOKES . New York , March 10 , 1951 . A Change of Enemies TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have been reading " 1984 , " by George Orwell , in which there occurs a description of the change of enemies for Oceana . I at once saw not a ludicrous situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , when I went in the Navy , there were four faces on posters ( Hate Posters , to use Orwell 's book ) ? Stalin , Hitler , Musso and Hirohito . Suddenly Stalin 's picture disappeared . I was furious . Without any vindication other than that Russia was suddenly fighting Germany ! ' ( as if her arms changed her ideologies , which we hall been taught to hate ) wt were , in fact , told to admire and love Stalin . The newspapers were sticky with pictures of comradeship between G. I. Joe and Ivan . Then slowly the Hate for Russia waN reintroduced , and , Heaven help us , Franco , the last of Hitler 's Children , has been acquiring a whitewash . Has no one any comment to make ? ' Or do I take Orwell 's book as the heightened fact it seems to be and pre- . pare myself for either Truth in Lies , , War in Peace , etc. , etc.  --  or for extermination ? JESSE BEERS Jr .
