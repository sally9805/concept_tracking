For three weeks the governors of the Toronto Stock Exchange had been investigating the gyrations in the stock of a little steel company named Chatco Steel Products Ltd . Last week the exchange ordered trading in the stock stopped " to protect the interests of American investors " - supposedly the small , unknowing investors who had bought the shares through high-pressure salesmen in the U.S. But this was only part of the story . <P> The surprising fact was that the ban on trading had not been necessary to protect the unknowing American investors . Few , if any , of them had lost money on the stock . In fact , they could have made a lot . Those who had lost money-and stood to lose a great deal more-were the hardeyed professional speculators on Toronto 's Bay Street who had committed one of the mortal sins of speculation : they had been " caught short " in Chatco stock . They had sold thousands of shares of the stock in hopes that it would fall and they could pick it up later at a cheaper price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government securities expert : " It 's the first time in years that anything like this has happened here . I 've read in books about markets being cornered , but I 've never seen it . This is the classic situation . This is a corner and the short sellers have been caught in it . " <P> " $15 by Christmas . " The short sellers ' problems began last June , when Chatco 's President Harold S. Shannon decided to shift Chatco from its unprofitable steel contract business into the production of air conditioners , truck bodies , etc . To get cash , Chatco sold 100,000 new shares , at $4.50 a share , to four New York and Montreal investors who took control of the company . Robert C. Leonhardt , president of Manhattan 's McGrath Securities Corp. , an over-the-counter brokerage firm , was elected chairman of the board . <P> Shortly after , U.S. over-the-counter firms began pushing Chatco stock , predicting that Chatco , then selling at about $9 , " will hit $15 by Christmas . " As Chatco rose to 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for quotes on the price , and began to investigate , suspecting the stock was being rigged . <P> Down &; Up . As rumors spread on Bay Street that the Toronto Stock Exchange would probably suspend Chatco , the speculators sold thousands of shares short , figuring that the suspension would knock down the price of Chatco as it did Great Sweet Grass Oils only three weeks before ( TIME , Nov. 5 ) . But the short sellers made one big mistake : they failed to realize that Chatco has only 160,000 shares outstanding . Shannon owned about 36,000 shares , and the Leonhardt interests a big chunk of the rest , leaving few shares around for trading . When the suspension was announced , the stock dropped from 16 ? to 10 , but only for a few hours . The Leonhardt interests began to buy , and it started up again , causing some shorts to panic and buy in order to cover their commitments , thus sending the stock up . <P> By week 's end Chatco was up to a new high of 19 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short sellers , pleading for it to arbitrate a fair price at which the stock might be traded and they could settle their short sales . But it gave no indication that it would . . It looked as if the wolves in Toronto had been sheared by the smarter wolves in Wall Street .
