txt BUS FINANCE PLAN OFFERED BY MAYOR AS TALKS COLLAPSE State , City Yielding of Some Taxes Tied to New Set-Up for 5% Dividend Limit LINES CALL STEP TOO LATE Insist on a Fare Rise to Avert Dec.31 Strike  --  Union Balks at Conditional Contract By A. H. RASKIN Acting almost at the same moment that union-management negotiations to prevent a New Year 's Eve bus strike collapsed , Mayor Impellitteri made public last night his long-awaited plan to provide the financial aid needed to finance a forty-hour work-week for 8,000 members of the Transport Workers Union , C. I. 0. , on eight privately owned bus lines . The plan , drafted by the Mayor 's Transit Advisory Commission and approved by Mr. Impellitteri at his Florida vacation retreat , called upon the state to free the bus operators of 53,031,081 a year in state taxes and the - city to surrender $844,360 a year in municipal levies . The tax-relief idea was tied into a long-range program for reorganizing the basic financial structure of the private transit companies along lines approved by Governor Dewey and the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road but never put into effect . The Impellitteri plan would limit dividends of the proposed new " Omnibus Redevelopment Corporation " to 5 per cent a year and would specify that all profits in excess of 5 per cent be shared equally by the company , the city and the state . Operators Foresee Long Delay Spokesmen for the bus operators said the program was so " encyclopedic " that it would take years to get the necessary authorization from the Governor , the Legislature , the Board of Estimate , the City Council , the security holders of the companies and the courts that were likely to become involved in the attendant litigation . Even though the Mayor sought to overcome this time lag by proposing that the city and state grant " temporary tax relief , under suitable safeguards , for an emergency period of one year , " company executives predicted that nothing tangible would be done before the New Year 's Eve strike deadline . They observed that the Legislature could not even begin considering the problem until afters it convened on Jan , 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the only practical method " for installing a forty-hour week without a stoppage of buses that normally carry 3,500,000 // riders a day in Manhattan , the Bronx , Queens and lower Westchester , but the Mayor vetoed this approach . He also made it clear that he had no present intention of giving up the $2,100,000 a year the city now collects from the bus companies in franchise payments or the $500,000 it gets in real estate - imposts . The only taxes the Mayor was willing , to throw into the pot were the $694,548 the city takes in through its 1 per cent utility levy , $143,092 in sales taxes and $6,720 in vehicle use taxes . On the state side , Mr. Impellitteri urged forgiveness of $1,391 , - 183 now collected through a 2 per cent utility tax , $349,270 in additional franchise levies and $1,290 , - 628 in gasoline and Diesel oil taxes . Some of the steam was stolen from the Mayor 's plan by Controller Lazarus Joseph 's demand last Tuesday that the state give up all of its bus taxes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of the New York bus companies . The Joseph proposal , which was not accompanied by any suggestion that the city relinquish any of its revenue , got an icy reception in Albany . Rejection of Contingent Pact Michael J. Quill , president of the transit union , continued to stand aloof from the wrangle over who should provide the funds to pay for the shorter work week . Mr. Quill and a union negotiating committee stalked out of a conference with executives of the jointly owned New York City Omnibus Corporation and Fifth Avenue Coach Company at 4 P. M. The union president asserted that the companies had " absolutely nothing to offer " and predicted that all the bus workers would quit work when their present nostrike agreements expired at midnight Dec. 31 . The union has meetings scheduled with some of the companies today , but Mr. Quill expressed certainty that the talks would break off in the same manner as those with the Omnibus and Fifth Avenue managements . Edmund C. Collins , vice president of the two companies , said they had offered to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher fare or other financial assistance , but the union rejected any contingent pact . In an effort to revive the negotiations , Daniel Kornblum , director of the City Labor Relations Division , summoned the three members of a special fact-finding board appointed by the Mayor to meet with him this morning at his offices in the Municipal Building . In making public his ? transit plan , the Mayor gave unqualified endorsement to the union 's demand for a forty-hour week , but urged the union to be " sensible and coperative " in working out operating schedules to translate the shorter work-week into reality . " There are many legitimate con-. cessions which they the bus workers can and should make to achieve an economically sound forty-hour week within the frame ' work of the basic 10-cent fare , " 1 the Mayor said . This note of caution highlighted the city 's fear that the hourly wage rate on the private bus lines might be pushed up so high in the changeover that the Board of Transportation would have to pay out millions of dollars to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus lines up to terms . of parity . Hourly wages on the private lines now range from $1.66 to $1.7332 for a basic week of fortyfour to forty-eight hours , but most of the workers put in four to nine hours of guaranteed overtime . The union is seeking to incorporate all of the present take-home pay , including overtime into the adjusted hourly rates under the forty-hou ? schedule . Plan for L , I. Road Cited The Mayor described the plan put forward by his transit advisers as " logical , fair- and equitable , and completely divorced from politics . " The plan stressed the state 's actions in the Long Island Rail Road reorganization as justifying tax abatement for the private bus lines . It made no reference to the fact that the city is fighting a decision by the Legislature to allow the Long Island Transit Authority to escape $3,000,000 a year in municipal real estate taxes . Under the Impellitteri plan , the companies would receive no specific guarantee of financial relief if they entered into contracts before the city and state authorities ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report said it could be " assumed that no one in authority desires deficit operation by the private companies and , therefore , if temporary relief is indicated pending enactment of this p  --  og  --  am , it should also be considered . " Special consideration would be given to the Third Avenue Transit Corporation , which is already in bankruptcy , tile report indicated . The advisory commission is headed by Edward C. Maguire , a member of the Board oe . Water Supply . Its other members are Mr. Kornblum and Corporation , Counsel Denis M. Hurley .
