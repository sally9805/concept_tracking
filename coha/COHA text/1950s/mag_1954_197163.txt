In a Brooklyn courtroom last week , Joseph D. Nunan Jr . settled a long-overdue bill the hard way . Nunan , onetime Commissioner of Internal Revenue for Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman ( 1944-47 ) , listened in silence as Federal Judge Walter Bruchhausen sentenced him to five years in the penitentiary and fined him $15,000 for evading $91,086 in income taxes . In passing sentence-one of the stiffest ever handed down for tax evasion-Judge Bruchhausen took official cognizance of Joe Nunan 's old position as top tax collector of the land . " The court does not overlook the fact that the defendant 's duties . . . afforded him unusual opportunities for acquaintance with the tax laws and regulations , " he said . " Possessed as he was with all of this knowledge and information , his failure to properly account for and pay his own taxes emphasizes his guilt . "
