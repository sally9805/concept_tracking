Nobody offered much argument last January when President Truman predicted a budget deficit of $5.1 billion for the 1950-51 fiscal year . But last week things looked a little different . U.S. income , thanks to the boom , was running well ahead of estimates . Thus , chances were good that the deficit would be much smaller than estimated even with new arms orders , since actual spending lags far behind appropriations . <P> For July and August , the first two months of the fiscal year , Treasury receipts were 7% higher than the same period last year and expenditures were 26% less . At this rate , Treasury 's income at year 's end would amount to some $39.6 billion v. the President 's prediction of $37.3 billion . The pending tax bill would add another $3.5 billion , bringing Treasury 's total take to about $43.1 billion . Even with bigger defense appropriations , it looked as if the Treasury 's cash outlay would not exceed $44 billion . <P> Furthermore , the prospect was that tax receipts would continue to increase , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every $10 billion increase in the gross national product results in slightly more than a $2 billion increase in Treasury 's tax revenues . In a year , the gross national product has soared $14.7 billion ( to a rate of $270 billion annually ) , enough to add nearly $3 billion to the Treasury 's purse . Under the new tax law the increase will be even faster . If the gross national product keeps climbing-and there is no reason to think it won't-the Treasury might even find the budget in balance for the first time since fiscal 1948.
