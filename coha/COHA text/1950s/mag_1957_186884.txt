To the ancients , a chimera was a fabulous monster with a lion 's head , a serpent 's tail and often an extra head in the middle of its back . To the botanist , it means a plant combining growths of differing genetic makeup-usually the result of grafting . Now British medical scientists are discovering human chimeras , in which one person has some of the body cells of another , invariably a twin . <P> First case so reported was that of a Mrs. McK. , whose red cells were 60% type O and 40% type A ( TIME , July 20 , 1953 ) . It seemed clear that she had derived them in the womb from a twin brother , but medical detectives could get only circumstantial evidence because the brother died in infancy . Now , in the British Medical Journal , research teams report two cases with both twins alive . <P> Mrs. W. , a healthy woman of 29 , then mother of two , presented herself for blood grouping ( as a precaution before birth of a third child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July . She was found to have 49% type O cells , 51% type A. Her twin brother was called in , found to have 61% type A , 39% type O. Mrs. W. 's husband is type O ; so are all three of their children . <P> When Miss W. , 21 , made a donation at the North London Blood Transfusion Centre , the typing of her blood proved tricky : it turned out to be 99% type O , 1% type A. Her twin brother showed 86% type A , 14% type O. <P> More than a dozen assorted medical specialists worked on the cases , came to the unanimous conclusion that there had been connections between the placental blood vessels in each pair of twins during gestation . Blood cells in both men contained certain knobs ( known as drumsticks , because of shape ) usually found only in females . When chimerism occurs in cattle , the female is sterile-a freemartin . Mrs. McK. and Mrs. W. have each had three children , so human chimeras are not freemartins . Despite their originating from separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages of identical ( one-egg ) twins : skin grafts between chimerical twins should " take " permanently .
