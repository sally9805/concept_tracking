Or so I thought when my wife and I first arrived . The compactness of the island appealed to me at once . I like neat places . I enjoy the feeling , whether I am in my own workroom or in a foreign hotel , that everything around me is in its place , within easy reach , and readily accessible . On the third day of our visit , when I came back to the hotel with the sandals and other tourist trinkets for which I had spent the afternoon shopping , I began to wonder if Capri was not , perhaps , just a trifle too compact . " Pio has been asking for you , " my wife said . I was not surprised , but I was beginning to feel a bit hounded ? Pio had been asking for me ever since we arrived . " What does he want ?

Then , apparently stabbed by a twinge of guilt for what looked like desertion , she added , " Why do n't you just tell him that you 're not the Secretary of State ? " " I 've tried that , several times , but it does n't do any good , " I said . " The trouble is that Pio thinks all Americans are touched by God . " It was not difficult to understand how the thought had taken root in his mind , once you knew his background .

The Hotel Semiramis , which commands a magnificent view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . The tourist season had been over fur a month . When my wife and I , on the day of our arrival ; came into the bar for a drink before dinner , the only other occupants of the large , somewhat gloomy room were a German couple and the barman . " Good evening , " he said with a how . " Would you perhaps care for a really good dry martini ? " Wc said we would and , after the first sip , my wife and I exchanged a look of pleased surprise . " Where , " she asked the barman , " did you earn to make a martini as good as this ? " " In Montana , " he said . - Where I learned also to speak English . " My wife and I uttered the appropriate expressions of astonishment , and the barman introduced himself as Pio . He was a good-looking man of about fifty , not very tall but well built , with a dignified and rather sad face that brightened amazingly when he smiled .

As a result , even though I wanted to ask Pio what he had been doing in Montana , I was hesitant about putting the question to him . My hesitation proved unnecessary . No did not wait for the question . " Before I went to Montana , " he said , " I was a sailor . " It was during his days as a sailor that he had been seized by the obsession that ruled his life . Pio did not call it an obsession . He merely recited the facts . p ro was born in Naples . His family was very poor . At sixteen he went to sea as a steward . He was not quite seventeen when his ship steamed into New York harbor one sunny April day and he had his first glimpse of the new world . It was enough . From that moment , until my wife and I met him almost thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one desire : to live in America . " But legitimate , " he added firmly . " I want to be a citizen . " The importance of this point had been driven home to him almost at once . The day after his love affair with the United States began , almost thirty years ago , No jumped ship . He made his way to the home of a distant cousin who lived in Brooklyn . The cousin , an older man who had come to America many years before , explained the facts of life to Pio . He told me about the immigration laws and quotas , " No said . " He told me as soon as the captain of my ship found out I was missing , he would have to report to the immigration people , and then the police would begin to look for me . He told me even if ittook them many years to find me , when they did they would deport me . The only way to come to live in America , my cousin said , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way could a man become a citizen . That night I left my cousin 's house , and I went back to my ship . " F OR sixteen years , while he sailed the . seven seas to earn his living , Pio never stopped trying to enter the United States as a legal immigrant . The quota always barred his path . Pio did not despair . In his heart , which he had given to America at first sight , he knew that some day his great dream would come true . It took a war , however , to justify his confidence . The day that Mussolini brought Italy into the conflict , Pio 's ship happened to be at Panama , waiting to enter the canal . The ship was seized at once , and the crew was sent to an internment camp for enemy aliens in Montana . There were members of that crew who resented this imprisonment . Pio was not one of them . His passion for America was so great , he had lived for so long with the dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to resent the fact that the piece on which he had finally been allowed to set foot was surrounded by barbed wire . His view was restricted , but Pio liked what he saw . He liked it even better when , apparently because of his cheery smile , he was ordered out from behind the barbed wire to serve as barman in the understaffed officers ' club . " There it was / learned to make a dry martini , " he said . And there it was that General Hershey destroyed my hopes . " " General Hershey ? " I said . " What did he have to do with it ? " " He was the Director of your American Selective Service , " Pio said . " After Italy was knocked out of the war , General Hershey announced that Italian internees in the United States who enlisted in the American Army would be eligible for citizenship . I hurried quickly to enlist : " Pio paused . His sad face brightened . He seemed to have forgotten our presence . He was staring across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far side of the gloomy room , but I knew Pio was not seeing them , either . He was staring back into the past , to the time when General Hershey had almost made Pio 's dream come true , to the moment when , for a fleeting instant , the unattainable had at last seemed to be within his grasp . Then the smile vanished . Pio brought his glance back to us . " I was not quick enough , " he said quietly . " General Hershey made another announce-The United States Army did not need men , he said . Internees were not wanted . When the war ended , I was sent back to Italy . Will you have another ? " My wife and I had another , but we did not enjoy the second martini as much as the first . The trouble was Pio 's eyes . Looking into them , you could not help seeing that to this simple man you were one of the anointed . Suddenly , with a small feeling of guilt , you were forced to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually for granted ever since it had been handed to you at birth : the right to call yourself an American . " From the end of the war until today , " Pio said , " I have not stopped trying for a single moment to return ti:3 America . " He shrugged , and continued , " Always , however , it is the same problem : the quota . " " Well , " I said awkwardly , as I lifted my glass to his health , " I hope you make it some day . " " Thank you , " Pio said , and his wonderful smile seemed . to light up the gloomy room . " I know I will . " T N VIEW of the stubborn facts that had thus far stood in his way , I found the quiet certainty in his voice distressing . It did not seem right that any man , wanting anything as much as Pio had for thirty years wanted to become an American , should be barred from it by something so impersonal and inflexible as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a man of fifty ? opretend those stubborn facts did not exist . Pio must have read my thoughts . " A quota is like a stone wall , " he said . " A man can not go through it . But a man can always go around a stone wall . " A tall , slender youngster came in , carrying a wooden bucket full of chopped ice . He carried the bucket behind the bar . Pio dipped down , lifted the chromium lid of a chest , and held it open while the boy poured the ice into the chest . There was something about the way Pio did it , adding a touch of affectionate concern to the casual act , that made me take a second look at the boy . He was very handsome , with a long , delicate face that had something of Pio 's sadness in it . He seemed to be about nineteen or twenty . He straightened up with the empty bucket . Pio dropped the chromium lid into place , and put his arm around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Valerio . " My wife and I nodded and smiled and murmured greetings . The boy blushed furiously , bobbed his head , said , " How do you do ? " in heavily accented but intelligible English , and almost ran out of the bar with his bucket . Pio watched him go with a smile . " Valerio is very shy , " he said . " But he will get me around that stone wall . " " How ? " I said , turning back to the barman . " I learned in America other things besides how to make a good dry martini , " Pio said . " I ledrned what American girls like . I think my son Valerio has it . " He sent another glance toward the door through which the boy had disappeared . " He is good-looking , is he not ? " " Very , " my wife said . " He looks like his father . " Pio smiled and bowed . " Thank you , Madame , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than good looks . He has brains . He wants to become a doctor . I encourage him . He is about to enter medical school . In four years , with his diploma and his good looks , Valeria will be ready . " " For what ? " I said . To marry an American girl . " " Oh , " I said . Pio nodded . " It is the only way around the stone wall , " he said . " Many American girls come here to Capri in the tourist season . Valerio will choose one and marry her . After she goes home to America , she will send for him . There are no quotas for husbands of American girls . Then , after ? Valerio becomes an American citizen , he will send For me . There are no quotas for the fathers of American citizens , either . " Pio smiled . " It is simple , is it not ? " " Yes , " I said . I did not add that I thought it was a trifle too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine  --  until you examined it for a moment . The examination revealed that it was not a chain at all . It was merely a string of suppositions , a flimsy structure built of wishful thinking , a grab bag of hopes . There was no certainty that Valerio would win a diploma . If he did , there was no certainty that it would win him an American wife . If it did , there was no certainty that she would want to help bring Pio to America . The only certainty , in fact , seemed to be that Pio 's obsession had made him a trifle unrealistic . And yet , as you looked at this quiet , dignified , self-possessed man , something of his confidence seemed to reach out and touch you . The string of suppositions seemed to become more than that . The filmsy structure built of wishful thinking took on solidity . The bits and pieces in the grab hag of hopes became an unbreakable chain . What held them together was Pio 's faith . ?

The next day , when we returned to the hotel after a visit to Axel Mundie 's villa at Aitacapri , I found in my box a note from the barman . " I hope you will be able to stop in the bar this afternoon , " he wrote . " It is very important that I see you . I come on duty at four-thirty . Thank you . Gratefully , Pio . " Four-thirty is much too early for cocktails . In our family , anyway . My wife , therefore , suggested that I go down to the bar alone , and she would join me later . It was not , apparently , too early for the German couple . They were sitting at the same table they had occupied the day before . They were , aside from Pio , the only people in the room . The barman 's handsome , dignified face brightened when he saw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and then , with an anxious glance at the door , " And Madame ? " " She 'll be along in a little while , " I said . " I thought I 'd better come down at once because you said in your note what you wanted to scc me about was important . " " It is , yes , " Pio said . He looked across my head , at the silent German couple , and then he dropped his voice . " Are you acquainted with the Potomac River ? " I could feel my forehead crease with puzzlement . " The Potomac River ? " " Yes , " Pio said . " In America ? The Potomac River ? You are acquainted with it ? " " I do n't think I understand what you mean , " I said slowly . " I know about the Potomac . I mean I know where it is , and I know roughly how it flows , but ? " " Could you tell me if , in the Potomac River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I stared at the barman. that I was more than astonished . I was also a little suspicious . It occurred to me that this sad-faced man , who had aroused my sympathy the clay before , might now be pulling my leg . " No , " I said with a slight edge in my voice , " I do n't think there are salmon in the Potomac . " " You are certain ? " Pio asked anxiously . " Fairly certain , " I said . " If there were , I think I would have heard about it . " Pio scowled . My answer , quite obviously , was not the one he had hoped for . " But ? " he began in a troubled voice . Then lie shrugged as though , in a lifetime of disappointments , this new one was hardly unbearable . " Thank you very much , " Pio said quietly . " And now may I make you a dry martini ? " He did , and when my wife came into the bar he made me another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Potomac . Not then , anyway . T HE next morning my wife and I took the funicular down to the Marina Grande and hired a motorboat to take us to the Blue Grotto . When we got back to the hotel at noon , a man approached our cab as we stepped out . He had obviously been waiting for us . He was wearing a shiny but neatly brushed blue suit instead of his white barman 's coat , and so I did not recognize Pio until he smiled . " Excuse me , " he said , and then I noticed that the smile seemed forced . The quiet confidence that had impressed me on our first night in the Hotel Semiramis had vanished . Something had obviously gone wrong . Pio looked upset . He said , " May I take perhaps a half hour of your time ? " " Both of us ? " I said . " Well ? " Pio said with obvious discomfort . " You run along , " my wife said promptly . " I want to go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll wait for you here . " Pio bowed gratefully . My wife went up the steps and disappeared into the hotel . I turned to the barman . " What can I do for you ? " " If you will be so kind , " Pio said . " Come . " He led me into an alley that ran alongside the Hotel Semiramis . We emerged , at the back of the building , in a small square built out to the very edge of a cliff that dropped several hundred feet to the bay below . From this square , curving and twisting down like a welt raised by the lash of a whip , ran a narrow footpath that had been sewn out of the solid rock . It was quite steep , paved with small round cobblestones , and guarded on the bay side by a stone wall . Walking down this path behind Pio was a little like descending a ladder while facing in the wrong direction . I found myself leaning backwards as I walked and , every now and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , we came to another alley . It branched off at right angles from the cobbled footpath . I noticed , as we turned into the alley , that it was marked by a stone sign : " Via 1V1ufo . " Perhaps a hundred feet down the Via Mulo , Pio stopped in front of a black iron gate set between two crumbling gate posts . On the gate hung a small , battered sign : " Villa Au-gusto . " Pio opened the gate . I followed him into a tangled , overgrown garden with weeds that towered over our heads . We went along a cracked stone walk , and up to a dirty old door that sagged on its hinges . Pio knocked . The door was opened at once by a toothless old woman wearing a filthy pink wrapper and a green eye shade . Pio said something to her in rapid Italian . She squinted at me , bobbed her head , and turned . " All right , " she said in English . " Bring him along . " p ro and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously used for some . sort of consultations . There was a square table in the middle , surrounded by straight-backed chairs . The walls were hung with phrenologist 's charts , horoscopes , and diagrams that were meaningless to me but which , to judge by the greasy fingermarks that covered them , received a good deal of use . The old woman sat down at the table . Pio took the chair facing her and indicated , with a small , polite bow , that I was to take the chair between them . I did . The old woman folded her hands on the table in front of her and stared at her cracked , black-rimmed fingernails . " You say there are no salmon in the Potomac River ? " she said . For several startled moments , I did not realize she had addressed me . When I did , I sat up straighter in my chair . " Yes , " I said . " I mean no , not to my knowledge . " She unclasped her hands , rubbed her nose with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pio . " Tell me again how it was , " she said . " Slowly , please . " Pio leaned forward anxiously . " I was flying through the air with a sword , " he said , speaking with great care , as though he were dictating to a stenographer . " Suddenly I saw a river beneath me . I flew down to identify it , and saw a sign that said it was the Potomac . A moment later I saw a great silver salmon swimming in the river . I. swooped down and speared the salmon with my sword . Then I woke up . " It suddenly dawned on me where I was and what was happening . The toothless old woman was evidently a dream interpreter . She turned back to me . " You heard him , " she said . " Do you still say there are no salmon in the Potomac ? " I looked at Pio . He was watching me hopefully , almost imploringly . I did not know what the problem was . I did know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , however , how I could do this until he told me precisely what sort of help he wanted . " Look , " I said . " l 'm not an authority on these matters . Fish and rivers are a little out of my line . All I can do is tell you what ? " " Answer the question , " the old woman said irritably . " Are there , or are there not , salmon in the Potomac River ? " " To the best of my knowledge , " I said patiently , " definitely not . " " I 'm sorry , " the old woman snapped , pushing back her chair . She stood up and made a gesture of dismissal to Pio . " There 's nothing I can do for you . " She stalked out of the room . I looked at Pio with a feeling of discomfort . I had obviously failed him . I could n't , however , quite imagine how . ' He stood up slowly , his face fixed in a troubled scowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he were probing for an elusive pain . I followed him in silence , out of the Villa Augusto , across the tangled garden , and back along the Via Mulo to the cobbled path . I waited until we had started the upward climb before I cleared my throat noisily . " I do n't seem to have been of much assistance to you , " I said . " I 'm sorry . " Pio 's shoulders moved in a small , hopeless shrug . " It can not be helped , " he said . " You arc art American . You know better than we do if there are salmon in the Potomac River . " " Perhaps I could be more helpful if I knew more about what you 're trying to do . " " What I have been trying to do for thirty years , " Pio said quietly . " Move around the stone wall of the quota . " T WENTY minutes later , in our hotel room , as I explained the situation to my wife , I realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mind . " It 's a matter of half a million lira , or about eight hundred dollars , " I said . " Pio must have it for the first payment of Valerio 's tuition in medical school . It 's due on Monday , and the only way a man like Pio can put his hands on half a million lira is to win it in the national lottery . The drawing takes place on Saturday , and today being Thursday , that gives Pio two days to buy his ticket . He ca n't do that . however , until he figures out the tip he received in this dream he had about the salmon in the Potomac . Pio feels it 's the key to the winning number . That 's why he asked me about it yesterday , and that 's why he took me to the dream interpreter just now . Unfortunately , I do n't seem to have ? " I paused , and gave my wife a sharp glance . " What 's wrong ? " She was staring at me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it a little frightening ? " " What ? " I said . " Pin 's faith . " " Yes , " 1 said . I also found it a trifle incredible . He apparently believed firmly that if he did not get his dream interpreted properly , he would not win the lottery , which meant he would not have the money to pay for Valerio 's medical school tuition , which meant the boy would not he able to marry an American girl , which meant Valerio would not be able to go to America and become an American citizen , which meant he would not he able to send for his father , which meant Pio was right back where , when he fell in love with America thirty years ago , he had started from : facing the stone wall called a quota . " Listen , " I said , " are you enjoying your stay here on Capri ? " " Why do you ask ? " my wife said . " It 's a pretty small place , and it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , " I said . " I was wondering why , instead of waiting until Sunday , we could n't leave tomorrow ? It would give us an extra couple of days in Rome . " My wife gave me a shrewd glance . " It would also give me the feeling that we 're running away , " she said , " No 's Faith may be upsetting to contemplate , but it 's hardly our responsibility . I wish I could help him , just as you do , but because you ca n't interpret a dream about a salmon in the Potomac , I do n't see why we should try to leave Capri ahead of schedule . Besides , " my wife added , " now that you 've demonstrated your inadequacy as an interpreter of dreams , I have a feeling that Pio will stop bothering you . " S HE was wrong , of course , as I found out the next day , which was Friday , when . I came back to the hotel from my shopping expedition and learned that Pio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not think I am a nuisance , " he said awkwardly when I came into the bar . " / do not , however , have much time left to buy my lottery ticket , and I wondered if perhaps you had since yesterday had any further thoughts about my dream ? " " No , I 'm sorry , " I said . " All I can say is what I 've said before : to the best of my knowledge there are no salmon in the ? " I stopped . I had caught sight of my wife , who had promised to join me in a little while , hurrying into the bar . She is not an excitable person . Over a dozen years , however , I have learned to recognize certain symptoms . They are scarcely discernible to the untrained observer . To me they indicate clearly when my wife has reached a point approximately similar to that which caused Archimedes to start shouting in his tub . One of the symptoms is a total lack of awareness that I am alive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she came up to the bar . " I think I 've riot it ! " He did not bother to ask what . To a man with an obsession , she could be talking about only one thing . " Madame " Pio said in a light little voice . " Madame , tell me , please ! " 64 THINK you 've been attacking the dream from the wrong angle ! " my wife said . " It just came to me as I was combing my hair ! I do n't think it matters whether there are salmon in the Potomac or not ! I think what matters is the Potomac ! It flows through Washington , D. C. That 's where the immigration laws were written ! That 's where the quota was born ! And Washington is the capital of the United States ! In other words , it 's our number one city ! Do you see what I mean ? Number One ! Do you understand what I 'm trying to ? ? " If he did n't , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : with every intention , or so it seemed , of crushing it to ' a pulp . " Madame ! " he said in a choked voice . " Madame , " he repeated , and the tears came to his eyes as he struggled with the phrasing of his gratitude . " Madame , this is what I have been waiting for ! The first number ! It is all I need ! The number one ! Madame , you have saved ? ! " He could n't finish the sentence . It was not , of course , necessary . He could n't seem to get out of the bar fast enough , either . As a result , I had to mix our own martinis that night . It was a pleasure . By the next morning , the day the lottery drawing was to take place , this pleasure had been replaced by a feeling of uneasiness . " I 've just had a horrible thought , " I said to my wife at breakfast . " Suppose the winning number does not begin with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible thought since late last night , " my wife said morosely . She stared thoughtfully into her coffee cup for several moments . Then she said , " When do they draw these lottery numbers ? " " At noon , up in Rome , " I said . " According to Pio , the winning numbers are announced on the radio at once , so that everybody in Italy knows about it in a few minutes . Why do you ask ? " " Well , Capri is a pretty small place , and it seems to me we 've just about seen everything there is to see , " she said casually . " I was wondering why , instead of waiting until tomorrow , we could n't leave this morning ? It would give us an extra day in Rome . " I stared at her . Like a good many married men , I find there are times when it suddenly occurs to me. with a feeling of complete astonishment , that I have been living with a genius . " Wait here , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back my chair . " I 'm going to find out at the desk about transportation . " T HERE was , I learned , a steamer that came in at eleven from Naples and sailed back to Naples at eleven-thirty . At eleven o'clock , after settling my bill , I left with the hall porter of the Hotel Semiramis an envelope addressed to Pio . It contained a small sum of money and a note of thanks , in which I explained that we were sorry to leave Capri without saying good-by to him in person , but our plans had changed unexpectedly and so we could not wait until four-thirty when he came on duty , and I closed by saying that my wife and I both hoped his great dream would come true and some day we would meet him in America . At eleven-fifteen my wife and I were standing on the quai at the Marina Grande , surrounded by our luggage , and wondering nervously bow the steamer could leave for Naples at eleven-thirty if it had not yet arrived . Ahalf-hour later , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Marina Grande . Ten minutes after that , while passengers from Naples were still disembarking , I became aware that there had been a sudden cessation of activity among the porters who had been unloading the luggage . They were all gathering around a neat little Lancia which was parked near the foot of the quai . " What 's happening ? " I said to my wife . " There 's a radio in that car , " she said . " Unless I 'm mistaken , they 've started drawing those lottery numbers up in Rome . " HE was not mistaken . As I joined the porters around the small Lancia , I could feel my heart begin to beat faster . I was well aware that we were running away , that we had arranged to leave Capri before the numbers were drawn because , if Pio lost , my wife and I did not want to have to face him . On the other hand , if he won , I knew I would be pleased by the role my wife had played in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mixed emotions that . during the next twenty minutes , I listened to the excited voice coming from the Lancia dashboard . I did not understand the words , of course . Rut words were not necessary . Numbers are a universal language . " Well , I guess that 's that . " I turned quickly . It was my wife . I had not realized she had come up beside inc. - Yes , " I said , " I guess it is . " Only the first six numbers had been drawn . But these were the only ones that carried substantial awards . A great many other numbers would be drawn before the next hour was finished . None would bring their lucky holders enough to pay for a year of tuition in a medical school . And none of the first six numbers began with the digit one . The small steamer 's whistle blew a warning blast . " I think we 'd better get going , " my wife said quietly . " The luggage is aboard already . " I nodded . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the quai to the gangplank . When we reached it , we both stopped short . Pio , wearing the shiny but neatly brushed blue suit , was waiting at the foot . " I came early to the hotel because I wanted to be with you when the numbers were drawn , " he said . " The hall porter said you were gone to the ship and he gave me your note . I came as quickly as I could . " I searched his face , then looked quickly at my wife . Shc , too , seemed to be puzzled by the question that was bothering me : if Pio knew what we knew , namely , that he had lost , why did n't he look defeated ? I turned involuntarily , toward the little Lancia . Pio touched my arm . I turned back . " It is all right , " he said quietly . " I heard the winning numbers from the ticket man in the funicular . He , too , has a radio . " " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as good an interpreter of dreams as I thought . " Pio laughed . I stared at him in astonishment . Far from looking defeated , he looked positively jaunty . " I disagree , Madame , " he said with a small bow . " I think you are an extremely able interpreter of dreams . " " I do n't see how you can say that , " my wife said . " As a result of my advice , you wo n't be able to pay Valerio 's tuition on Monday . " " I will pay it the following Monday , " Pio said , and he laughed again . " Your interpretation was correct . What . matters , you said , was the Potomac . Not the salmon in the Potomac . And not the city of Washington on the Potomac . Only the Potomac itself . And the Potomac begins with the letter P , which is the sixteenth letter in the alphabet . The number I should have chosen , therefore , should have begun , not with one , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and smiled . " A small error , of no consequence , " he said . " Next week , when I buy my lottery ticket , I will select a number beginning with sixteen , and the Monday after that , thanks to you , Madame , I will pay Valerio 's tuition . " 1 STARED at him the way I had stared at him during our first night in the Semiramis bar , when we had first learned about his obsession and Pio had told us his plan to circumvent the stone wall that had , for thirty years , barred his path . Once again I asked myself if he really believed what he was saying . And once again , as I stared into his eyes , I was touched by the absolute certainty of his simple faith . They were the eyes of a man for whom there could be neither defeat nor doubt . He lived by an inner fire .
