Cholmondeley the Chimpanzee Gerald M. Durrell . Drawings by N. M Bodecker , S HORTLY before we left our hilltop but at Bakebe and traveled down to our last camp at Kumba , we had with us a most unusual guest in the shape of Cholmondeley , known to his friends as Chumley . Chumley was a full-grown chimpanzee ; his owner , a District Officer , was finding the ape 's large size rather awkward and wanted to send him to London Zoo as a present , so that he could visit the animal when he was back in England on leave . He wrote asking us if we would mind taking Chumley back with us when we left and depositing him at his new home in London , and we replied that we would not mind at all . I do n't think that either John or myself had the least idea how big Chumley was : T know that I visualized an ape of about three years old , standing about three feet high . I got a rude shock when Chumley moved in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated sedately in a huge crate . When the , doors of his crate were opened and Chumley stepped out with all the ease and self-confidence of a film star , I was considerably shaken ; standing on his bow legs in a normal slouching chimp position , he came up to my waist , and if he had straightened up his head would have been on a level with my chest . He had huge arms and must have measured at least twice my size round his hairy chest . Owing to bad tooth growth , both sides of his face were . swollen out of all proportion , and this gave him a. weird pugilistic look . His eyes were small , deep-set , and intelligent ; the top of his head was nearly bald , owing , I discovered later , to his habit of sitting and rubbing the palms of his hands backward across his head , an exercise which seemed to afford him much . pleasure and which he persisted in until the top of his skull was quite devoid of hair . This was nu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran about eight or : nine years old , fully mature , strong as a powerful man , and , to judge by his expression , with considerable experience of life . Although he - was not exactly a nice chimp to look at ( I had seen handsomer ) , he certainly had a terrific personality : it hit you as soon as you set eyes on him . His little eyes looked at you with great intelligence , and there seemed to be a glitter of ironic laughter in their depths that made one feel uncomfortable . He stood on the ground and surveyed his surroundings with a shrewd glance , and then he turned to me and held out one of his soft , pink-palmed hands to be shaken , with exactly that bored expression that one sees on the faces of professional hand-shakers . Round Copyrighc 1953 by Gerald M. Durrell his neck was a thick chain , and its length drooped over the tail board of the lorry and disappeared into the depths of his crate . With an animal of less personality than Chumley. this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his captivity . But Chumley wore the chain with the superb air of a Lord Mayor ; after shaking my hand so professionally , he turned and proceeded to pull the chain , which measured some fifteen feet , out of his crate . He gathered it up carefully into loops , hung it over one hand , and proceeded to walk into the but as if he owned it . Thus , in the first few minutes of arrival , Chumley had made us feel inferior ; he had moved in , not , we felt , because we wanted him to , but because he did . I almost felt I ought to apologize for the mess on the table . He seated himself in a chair , dropped his chain on the floor , and then looked hopefully at me . It was quite ' obvious that he expected some sort of refreshment after his tiring journey . I roared out to the kitchen for someone to make a cup of tea , for I had been warned that Chumley had a great liking for the cup that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our humble abode with ill-concealed disgust , I went out to his crate , and in it I found a tin plate and a battered tin mug of colossal proportions . When I returned to the but bearing these , Chumley brightened considerably and even went so far as to praise me for my intelligence . ' " 0000000 , umph ! " he said , and then crossed his legs and continued Iris inspection of the hut . I sat down opposite him and pro- , duced a packet of cigarettes . As I was selecting one a long black arm was stretched across the table , and Chumley grunted in delight . Wondering what he would do , I handed him a cigarette , and to my astonishment he put it , carefully in the corner of his mouth . I lit my smoke and handed Chumley the matches , thinking that this would fool him . He opened the box , took out a match , struck it , lit his cigarette , threw the matches down on the table , crossed his legs again , and lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds of smoke out of his nose . Obviously he had vices in his make-up of which I had been kept in ignorance . Just at that moment Pious entered bearing the tray of tea ; the effect on him when he saw me sitting at the table with the chimp , srnoking and apparently exchanging gossip , was oonsiderable . " Eh-aehh ! " he gasped , backing away . " Whar 4 inoo , , , said Chumley , sighting the tea and waving one hand madly . " N a whatee that , sah ? " asked Pious from the doorway . " This is Chumley , " I explained . " He wo n't hurt you . Put the tea on the table . " Pious did as he was told and then retreated to the door again . As I poured tea and milk into Chumley 's mug and ' added three tablespoons of sugar , he watched me with a glittering eye and made soft " ooing " noises to himself . I handed him the mug and he took it carefully in both hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rid himself of the cigarette , which he found he could not hold along with the mug ; he solved the problem by placing the cigarette on the table . Then he tested the tea carefully with one lip stuck out , to see if it was too hot . As it was , he sat there and blew on it until it was the right temperature , and then he drank it down . When he had finished the liq uid there still remained the residue of syrupy sugar at the bottom , and as Chumley 's motto was obviously waste not , want not , he balanced the mug on his nose and kept it there until the last of the sugar had trickled down into his mouth . Then he held it out for a refill . C HUIVILEY 'S crate was placed at a conven- ient point about fifty yards from the hut , next to a great gnarled tree stump to which I attached his chain . From there he could get a good view of everything that went on in and around the hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and I would reply . That first day he ' created an uproar , for no sooner had I chained him up and gone into the but to do some work than a frightful upheaval took place among the monkeys . All these were tethered on ropes under a palm-leaf shelter just opposite the hut . Chumley , after I had left him , felt bored ; looking around , he perceived some sizable rocks lying about within easy reach . Arming himself with these , he proceeded to have a little underarm bowling practice . The first I knew of this was when I heard shrill screams and chatterings from the drills and guenons . I dashed out and was just- in time to see a rock the size of a cabbage land in their midst , fortunately missing them all . If one of these rocks had hit a monkey it would have been squashed flat . Seizing a stick , I raced down upon Chumley , waving it and shouting at him , trying to appear fearsome , while all the time I was wondering what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment to an animal almost my own size and with twice my strength , when I was armed with only a short stick that seemed ridiculously flimsy . However , to my surprise , Chumley saw me coming and promptly lay down on the ground , covered his face and his head with his long arms , ' and screamed loudly at the top of his voice . J gave him two cuts with the stick across his back , and it had about as much effect as if I had tried to demolish St. Paul 's Cathedral with a toothpick . His back was broad and flat , solid muscle as hard as iron . " You are a very wicked animal , " I said sternly , and Chumley , realizing that punish-merit was apparently over , sat up and started to remove bits of leaf from himself . " Wh000000 , " he said , glancing up at me shyly . " If you do that again I will have to give you a really good beating , " I continued , wondering if anything short of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 0000 , - said Chumley . He shifted forward , squatted down , rolled up my trouser leg , and then began to search my calf for any spots , bits of dirt , or other microscopic blemishes . While he was thus engaged I . called the animal staff and had them remove every rock from the vicinity . Later , after giving the beast yet another talking to , I left him , and shortly afterward I noticed him digging hopefully in the earth near his crate , presumably in search of more rocks . . That night , when I carried Chumley 's food and drink of tea out to him , he greeted me with loud " hoo haas " of delight , and jogged up , and down , beating his knuckles on the ground . Before he touched his dinner , however , he seized one of my hands in his and carried it to his mouth . With some trepidation I waited as he carefully put one of my fingers between his great teeth and very gently bit it . Then I understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between another ape 's teeth is a greeting and a sign of trust , for to place a finger in such a vulnerable position is a sure display of your confidence in theother 's friendliness . So Chumley was flattering me by treating me as he would another chimp . Then he set to and 1oonpolished off his meal . When he had finished I sat beside him on the ground , ana he went carefully through my pockets and examined everything I had on . me . . When I decided that it was time for him to go to bed he refused to give back a handkerchief which he had removed . He held it behind his back and passed it from one hand to the other as I tried to get it . Then , thinking that the action would settle the matter , he stuffed it hurriedly into his mouth . I realized that if I gave in and let him keep the handkerchief he would think that he could get away with anything , so for half an hour I sat there pleading with him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgorged it , now very sodden and crumpled . After this I had no trouble with him : if he was playing with something I wanted I would simply hold out my hand and ask him for it , and he would give it to me without any fuss . N ow , I have known a great number of attractive and charming animals , from mice to elephants , but I have never seen one to compare with Chumley for force and charm of personality , or for intelligence . After knowing him for a while you . ceased to look upon him as an animal ; you regarded him more as a fascinating , mischievous , courtly old man , who had for some reason best known to himself disguised himself as a chimpanzee . His manners were perfect : he would never grab his food and start guzzling , as the other monkeys did , without first giving you a greeting , and thanking you with a series of his most expressive " hoo haas . " Then he would eat delicately and slowly , pushing those pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . his fingers . His only breach of table manners came at the end of a meal , for then he would seize his empty mug and plate and hurl them as far as possible . He had , of course , many habits which made him seem almost human , and his smoking was one . He could light his cigarette with matches or a lighter with equal facility , and then he would lie down on the ground on his back , one arm under his head- and his legs bent up and crossed , blowing great clouds of smoke into the sky , and occasionally examin-ing the end of his cigarette professionally to see if the ash needed removing . If it did he would perform the operation carefully with one fingernail . Give him a bottle of lemonade and a glass , and he would pour himself out a drink with all the care and concentration of a world-famous barman mixing a cocktail . He was the only animal I have met that would think of sharing things with you : on many occasions , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three mangoes , he would choose one and hold it out to me with an inquiring expression on his face , and he would grunt with satisfaction if I accepted it and sat down beside him on the ground to eat it . Chumley had three aversions in life : African natives , giant millipedes , and snakes . Natives he would tolerate , and he got a great kick out of attracting them within range and then leaping at them with a ferocious scream . Not that I think he would ever have harmed them ; he just liked to watch them run screaming in fear . But the trouble was that the natives would tease him if they got the chance , and Chumley would get more and more excited , his hair would stand on end , he would sway from side to side , swinging his powerful arms and baring his great teeth . and then Heaven help the native who came too close . Giant millipedes fascinated him , but he could never bring himself to trust them wholeheartedly . The giant ? millipede looks not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , ( a hundred or so pairs ) arranged along the underside , and a pair of short feelers in front . They were completely harmless creatures that glided about on their numerous legs , their feelers waving , and liked nothing so much as a really rotten log of wood to feed on . However , their snakelike motion made them suspect in Chumley 's eyes , although he seemed to realize that they were not snakes . If I placed a couple on his box he would sit and watch them for hours , his lips pursed , occasionally scratching himself . If one walked over the edge of the crate and fell to the ground and then started to walk - in his direction , he would leap to his feet , retreat to the end of his chain , and scream loudly until I came ' and rescued him from the monster . Snakes , of course , worried him a lot , and he would get really most upset if he saw me handling one , uttering plaintive cries and wringing his hands until I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands after handling a snake he . would always examine them carefully-I presume to make sure I had not been bitten . Whenever a snake slid toward him he would nearly have a fit ; his hair would stand on end , he would moan , and , as it got closer , would throw bits of grass and twigs at it in a vain effort to stop its advance . One night he flatly refused to be shut in his box when it grew dark , a thing he had never done before . When I tried to force him in , thinking he was merely playing up , he led me to the door of the crate and , leaving me there , retreated , pointing with one hand and hoohooing loudly and in obvious fear . - Investigating his blankets and banana-leaf bed , I discovered- a small , blind , burrowing snake coiled up in the middle . This was a harmless creature , but Chumley was taking no chances . Not long after Chumley 's arrival he suddenly went off his food , lost all his interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crate . He would refuse all drink except about half a mugful of water a day . I was away at the time , and ' a frantic message from John brought me hurrying back , for John was not sure what the ape was suffering from or how ill he really was . On my return I tried everything I knew to tempt Chumley to eat , for He was growing visibly thinner . The staff was sent to search the countryside for ripe . mangoes and pawpaws , and delicate fruit salads were concocted with great care by my own hands . But Chumley would not eat . This went on for nearly a week , until I was really beginning to think we should lose him . Every evening I would force him to take a walk with me , but he was so weak that he had to sit down and rest every few yards . But I knew it would be fatal to let him lose all interest in life , for once an ape does that he is doomed . One evening before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin of Ryvita biscuits and concealed -a dozen or so in my pockets . . When we had walked some distance Chumley sat down and I sat beside him . As we both examined the view I took a biscuit from my pocket and started to eat it . He watched me ; I think he was rather surprised that I did not offer him any , as I usually did , but finished it . up and smacked my lips appreciatively . He moved nearer and started to go through my pockets , which was in itself a good ' sign , for he had not done that since the first day ' he had been taken ill . He found a biscuit , pulled it out , sniffed it , and then , to my delight , ate it up . He again broached my pocket and got another , which he also ate . Altogether he ate six , a'nd for the next four days he existed on water and Ryvita . Then came the morning when he accepted first his cup of tea and then two bananas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His appetite came back with a rush , and he ate us out of house and home for about two weeks , and then he returned to normal . I was very glad to have pulled him round , for we were due to leave for Kurnba , and he was in no condition to face the journey as thin as he had been . T HE day of our departure from Bakebe dawned , and when Chumley saw the lorry arrive to load the collection he realized he was in for one of his favorite sports , a lorry ride . He hooted and yelled and danced on the end of his chain with excitement , and beat a wild tattoo on his crate , making as much noise as possible so that we should not overlook him . Whe-n everything else had been loaded his crate was hoisted on board , and then he climbed into it , hooting delightedly . We started off , and we had not gone far before the staff , all clinging to the back and sides of the vehicle , started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chumley joined in with a prolonged and melodious hooting , which convulsed the staff . In fact , the cook-mate found a singing chimpanzee so amusing that he fell off the back of the lorry , and we had to stop and pick him up , covered with dust , but still mir thfu 1 . It was a good thing we were not going at any speed . At Kurnba , three schoolhouses belonging to the Basle Missiori were put at our disposal , through the , kindness of the Reverend Paul Schibler and his wife . On moving in , there was complete chaos for a while , as always happened when you made a fresh camp , and apart from numerous other things that had to be attended to , there was the question of water supply . While a suitable water-carrier was being employed , furnished with tins , and told to do his job at the double , Chumley made it quite clear that he was very thirsty indeed . He was chained outside , and had already attracted a large crowd of natives who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I opened a bottle of beer and gave him that , and to my surprise he greeted its arrival with hoots of joy and smacked his lips over the froth . The lower the level fell in the bottle the more Chumley showed off , and the larger the crowd grew around him . Soon he was turning somersaults , and in between dancing a curious sort of side shuffle and clapping his hands . He was covered with beer froth , and enjoying himself hugely . But this drunken jig caused me a lot of trouble , for it took Chumley several hours to sober up and behave properly , and it took three policemen to disperse the crowd of two hundred people that was wedged around our houses , making entry and exit impossible . After . that Chumley never had anything stronger than tea or lemonade , . no matter how thirsty he became . It was not long after we settled in at Kumba that Sue arrived . She was the youngest chimp I had even seen : she could not walk and was the proud possessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of which she peered with wide-eyed interest , sucking her left foot . How she had been kept alive by her native owner , who had been feeding her on a diet of mashed coco yam , I do n't know . Within an hour she was sucking away at a bottle fu11 of warm milk , liberally laced with sugar and cod-liver oil . When I took her out to show her to Chumley he displayed no interest other than trying to poke her in the eye with his forefinger , so my hopes of a romantic attachment faded . To any mother worn out with a squealing baby , I ' would be tempted to say , " Go and exchange it for a chimpanzee like Sue : it will be half the trouble and give you just as much pleasure . " Sue spent the night in a warm basket , and the day on my bed , and there was never a murmur out of her . The only times she screamed , clenching her little fists and kicking her legs in gusts of fury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then discovered it was too hot for her to drink straightway . This was a crime , and Sue let you know it . She had her first feeding at about seven o'clock in the morning , and her last feeding at midnight . She slept right through the night , a trick that is too uncommon among human babies . During the day , as I say , she would sprawl on my bed , lying there sucking her thumb or foot , or occasionally doing press-ups on the edge of the . bed to get her arm muscles in trim for feed . ing time . Most of the day , however , she just slept . Her face , hands , and feet were pink , and she had a thick coat of wiry black hair . On her head this looked as though it had been parted in the middle and then cut in a fringe over her large . ears . She reminded me of a solemn-faced Japanese doll . At first sight her , tender years ( or months ) had rather put me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention which I had not the time to give her . But , as it turned out , she was considerably less trouble than any of the other animals . The animal staff were so captivated by her that they would fight for the privilege - of g.iving her a bottle , and I even found John , on more than one occasion , prodding her fat middle and muttering baby talk at her , when he thought I was not within earshot . C HUMLEY was , I think , a little jealous of Sue , but he was too much of a gentleman to show it . Not long after her arrival , however , the London Zoo 's official collector arrived in the Cameroons , and with great regret T handed ' Chumlev over to be transported back to England . I did not see him again for over four months , and then I went to visit him in the sanatorium at Regent 's Park . He had a great straw-filled room to live in , and was immensely popular with the sanatorium staff . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had last seen me I had been clad in tropical kit and had sported a beard and moustache ; now I was clean-shaven and wearing the garb of a civilized map . But recognize me he did , for he whirled around his room like a dervish when he saw me and then came rushing across to give me his old greeting , gently biting my finger . We sat in the straw and I gave him some sugar I had brought for him , and then we smoked a cigarette together while he removed my shoes and socks and examined my feet and legs to make sure there was nothing wrong with them . Then he took his cigarette butt and carefully put it out in one corner of his room , well away from the straw . When the time came to go , he shook hands with me formally and watched my departure through the crack in the door . Shortly after he was moved to the monkey house , and so could receive no more visitors in his private room . I never saw Chumley again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great television star , going down to Alexandria Palace and doing his act in front of the cameras like an old trouper . Then his teeth started to worry him , and so he was moved from the monkey house back to the sanatorium to have an operation . One day , feeling ' bored with life , he broke out and sallied forth across Regent 's Park . When he reached the main road he found a bus conveniently at hand , so he swung himself aboard ; but his presence caused such horror among the occupants of the bus that he got excited and forgot himself so far as to bite someone . If only people would realize that to scream and panic is the best way of provoking an attack from any wild animal ! Leaving the bus and its now bloodstained passengers , Chumley walked down the road , made a pass at a lady with a pram ( who nearly fainted ) , and was wandering about to see what else he could do to liven life up for Londoners , when a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect Chumley had realiied that civilized people were no decent company for a well-brought-up chimp , so he took his keeper 's hand and walked back home . After this he was branded as not safe and sent back to the monkey house . But he had not yet finished with puhlicity , for some time later he had to go back to the sanatorium for yet more treatment on his teeth , and sohe decided to repeat his little escapade . It was Christmas Eve and Chumley obviously had memories of other and more convivial festivities , probably spent at some club in the depths of Africa . Anyway , he decided that if he had a walk around London on Christmas Eve , season of good will , he might run across someone who would offer him a beer . So he broke open his cage and set off once more across Regent 's Park . At Gloucester Gate he looked about hopefully for a bus , but there was not one in sight . But there were some cars parked there and Chumley approached them and beat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupants would open up and offer him a lift . Chumley loved a ride in any sort of conveyance . But the foolish humans misconstrued his actions : there he was , full of Christmas spirit , asking for a lift , and all they could do was to wind ' up their windows and yell for help . This , thought Chumley , was a damn poor way to show a fellow the traditional British hospitality . But before he had time to explain his mission to the car owners , a panting posse of keepers arrived , and he was bundled back to the Zoo . Chumley had escaped twice , and they were not going to risk its happening again . From being a fine , intelligent animal , good enough to be displayed on television , he had suddenly become ( by reason of his escapades ) a fierce and untrustworthy monster , who might escape yet again and bite some worthy citizen . To avoid this risk , Chumley was sentenced to death and shot .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
