txt Letters to The Times EDWARD I. FARLEY.J . SUSTR . Scranton , Pa. , Dec. 31 , 1949 . DOROTHY THOMPSON.R.W .... Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There is a serious  --  perhaps critical ? gap in our national defense program . It is the absence of an adequate standby civil defense and internal security program . It is possible that a sevenbillion-dollar military expenditure combined with an effective civil defense plan could give us greater national security than we have now with an appropriation twice that size . Tragically little is being done to organize our civilian resources to meet the crisis that would result from surprise attack by ' Russia . The Russians could deliver us , under the present circumstances of our civilian unpreparedness , a series of quick , paralyzing and perhaps decisive body blows . They know that we are not prepared to meet such an attack and that it would be tremendously successful . This unnecessary exposure may not only some day induce Russian attack but it aborts the security our national defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surprise attack would critically impair our ability to mobilize in time to help our allies . With the United States neutralized for even a few months , Russia would gain and consolidate her military objectives in Europe and Asia , with enormously enhanced chances of success . Our ability or our failure to weather successfully the initial shock of surprise attack may easily be a decisive factor in the next war . Time for Organization Then why do we not have an effective civil defense program ? It is apparently felt in Washington that Russia does not want war and that we are not now in danger . Therefore , it is also apparently reasoned , civil defense is not necessary . Yet it would probably take three years to organize a civil defense program to meet the kind of attack that Russia is now capable of delivering . Many of our military leaders feel that civil defense is a civilian responsibility ; many of our political and civilian leaders feel that it is a military responsibility , Obviously , effective civil defense must be the shared responsibility of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the National Security Resources Board .. This board is responsible to the President , and for political reasons has long been without a chairman . The board has only a small civil defense staff and has not been able to adequately provide the civil defense leadership nor to assume the responsibility in this matter that belongs to it . Failure to give civil defense the part it should have in the over-all defense program is clearly largely the President 's fault . He has ignored the one comprehensive study made on this subject  --  the so-called " Hopley Report " prepared by a staff of experts under the late Russel J. Hopley of the Office of Civil Defense Planning in the Secretary of Defense 's office in 1948 . He also ignored Bernard M. Baruch 's suggested stand-by civil and industrial mobilization plan . Mr. Truman 's views on civil defense are probably based on the hope that our fourteen-billion-dollar defense program will deter Russia from attacking us , and the view that civil defense does not make good political grist . Federal Leadership A few states , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taking measures to provide civil defense programs . However , an effective program requires that leadership originate and flow from Washington because of the required uniformity , flexibility and coordination . The actual implementation and administration of the over-all specifications can and should be accaamplishea by the individual states . The larger problem is how to awaken the President and the other responsible Washington authorities to thelact that we are wide open , and inviting trouble . As we now go , we are certainly not fooling Russia . We must not take false refuge in our inflated military budget , atomic bomb , B-36 , guided missile , and all . We must recognize in our thinking and planning that the civilian and his family , the factory and its workers  --  the nation itself  --  are exposed to direct and furious attack . Therefore , to deter Russia from war , to give us a better chance of winning if war should come , to get value received for every dollar spent on national defense  --  these things require without further delay an effective civil defense and internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? any of us realize .

If the Soviets used the money spent on the subway on solving the housing problem of the average Moscow citizen instead , the people would have no need to go to the subway to warm themselves up , but would rather stay home , if the slums they live in can be called homes at all . IJ . SUSTR .. Scranton , Pa. , Dec. 31 , 1949 . To THE EDIToR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On Jan. 8 THE NEW YORK TIMES carried on its front page an Associated Press dispatch under the headline " Referendum on Saar Urged by West Germar Minister . " The dispatch reported that Jacob Kaiser , West German Minister for the Reunification of Germany , had protested against the possibility of a fait accompli to detach the Saar from Germany . The correspondent wrote , " For generations the Saar , with about one million people , has been controlled alternately by France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war of 1870 . The Versailles Treaty after the First World War put the Saar under a League of Nations commissioner , but granted an economic link with France . But in 1935 ? after Hitler had organized a Nazi party there  --  the Saarlanders voted overwhelmingly in a plebiscite to return to Germany . " In the disposition of territories , historical as well as ethnic feat are usually considered , and it is therefore essential to justice that these be clear . Each one of the above statements is contrary to fact . The Saar with its million people has not for generations been controlled alternately by France and Germany . The valley was not annexed to Germany after the War of 1870 , and the plebiscite in 1935did not , as the dispatch implies , result from Hitler 's organizing a Nazi party in the Saar . The Saar has been German in population and German in sovereignty throughout the entire history of the valley except from 1801-1815 , when it ( along with the rest of Europe ) was conquered and subjugated by Napoleon I and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' far back as the Roman period it was all occupied by Alammani ( German tribes ) , was subdued by the Franks under Clovis at the end of the fifth century , and at the partition of Verdun in 843 ' it became part of the East Frankish or German Kingdoin . Placed Under German King In 1076 the founder of the House of Nassau , one Drutwin , consolidated what afterward became the Province of Hesse-Nassau , and his descendant , Walram , placed his lands , including the Saar , under the German King in 1198 . Uninterruptedly thereafter , the Saar , as part of Nassau , was within an independent and sovereign Duchy of Germany until Napoleon briefly redrew the map of Europe . It became part of Prussia in 1866 , as a preface to the consolidation of the German Reich . The Treaty of Versailles put the Saar under the League of Nations trusteeship , giving France its coal resources for fifteen years , with the proviso that at the end of this period Saarlanders should themselves determine by plebiscite whether they wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Nations . The plebiscite , conducted under the observation of a League of Nations commission , was therefore held in conformity with the treaty and had nothing to do with Hitler 's coming to power . The result was overwhelmingly in favor of Germany . The Saar is undisputedly German in population ; it is German historically ; it was German by self-determination in 1935 ; and Mr. Kaiser wishes the plebiscite test , a device of the Allies after the first war , to be repeated again . I am sure THE TIMES , with its deserved reputation for accuracy , will not wish to have this question prejudiced by a misrepresentation of facts which . can be obtained from any encyclopedia : DOROTHY THOMPSON . New York , Jan. 9 , 1950 . Lack of Civil Defense Effective Program for Defense and Internal Security Considered Vital History of the Saar Valley Said to Have Been German in Population and in Sovereignty The Moscow Subway To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : With the greatest interest I read in your issue of Dec. 31 the article " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dreamland story to those who have never been in Moscow . In the third paragraph of your article you write : " Gudok describes the stations as ' palaces for the people , ' compared with the gloomy capitalist subway stations ? * ? . " I have been in Moscow and I quite agree . The stations are full of marble and various decorations which must have cost a fortune . However , I do not think they have more air for the users , because they are overcrowded all the time . And , they are overcrowded because they seem to be palaces for the people of Moscow compared with the average dwellings of Gorkirs Street or Square of Revolution or any other fashionable street in Moscow . The Moscow subway was built to Crafts Magazine Needed for Blind To THE EDTTOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A blind friend writes me : " For years we blind have hoped to have a crafts magazine in Braille . Since the blind veterans have finished their rehabilitation courses , the need for this kind of publication has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found there are a few more than 60,000 blind in the United States and Canada who would benefit by such a magazine . We have six general magazines ' and a number of religious periodicals but no crafts magazine in Braille  --  nowhere in the world . There are many inkprint magazines giving instructions for handwork , ceramics , basketry , woodwork , etc . " A letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES over forty-three years ago brought into being the first of the Braille magazines , the Matilda Ziegler Magazine . Mrs. Ziegler saw the letter in THE TIMES and got in touch with its writer , Walter G. Holmes of Nashville . I know so well that where there is a need , there is a supply also . My faith in God is just that strong , but we must do our part and take the human steps . " This looks to me like a complete " natural . " R. W. Rua .
