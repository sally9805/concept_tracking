Through half a century Paul Gauguin has become increasingly famous as a painter of genius who invented a unique style . In that same period Emile Bernard has languished in the shadow as a second-rate symbolist . But back in the 1880s it was Bernard , at 20 , just half Gauguin 's age , who led the older man beyond impressionism and guided him toward the style that now defines him . Bernard was painting like Gauguin before Gauguin himself . <P> Evidence of the origin of Gauguin 's style was on exhibition last week in Manhattan 's new Hirschl &; Adler Galleries , the first time Bernard has ever had a one-man show in the U.S. With 31 paintings and some 20 watercolors and drawings of his Pont-Aven period ( 1886-93 ) , it is also the biggest show he has ever had anywhere . <P> An Unknown Named Van Gogh . Bernard 's role was never fully appreciated until Art Historian John Rewald told the story last autumn in his authoritative Post-Impressionism : From Van Gogh to Gauguin . In the late 1880s Gauguin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bernard was a precocious , rebellious , perceptive intellectual . He used to go on painting jaunts outside Paris with another unknown named Vincent van Gogh , who thought well of Bernard 's work . Van Gogh urged Bernard to see Gauguin , who had once rebuffed him , and the young painter went to Pont-Aven in early August 1888 equipped with the latest avant-garde notions from the capital plus some theories of his own and the ability to expound them all brilliantly . He was working away from impressionistic effects on canvas toward a symbolism in which simplified forms would forcefully and expressively convey the meaning of the objects they symbolized . <P> Though not nearly so talented as Gauguin , Bernard was much more articulate . Young Bernard 's theories fired the older painter 's imagination , prodded him to formulate his own ideas , and drove him to experiment on canvas . The two friends painted together at Pont-Aven , feverishly discussed their daily discoveries . That summer Gauguin made the major stylistic break of his life , began painting in the style that was to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The break between Gauguin and Bernard came when Gauguin proclaimed himself , in Bernard 's words , " the chief of the symbolist school in painting , " and Bernard felt that he had been betrayed . Years after the event Bernard recalled that his indignant sister tackled Gauguin in the middle of an auction room . " Monsieur Gauguin , " she cried , " you are a traitor . You have violated your pledge and are doing the greatest harm to my brother , who has been the true initiator of the art which you now claim for yourself . " According to Bernard , " Gauguin did not answer , and withdrew . " <P> Gauguin kept going toward the unknown and soared to fame-posthumously . Bernard , becoming enamored of Italian Renaissance masters , and veering toward mysticism , turned back toward safer paths and sank to obscurity . Though he lived to a ripe 72 ( and was a key figure in bringing Van Gogh 's work to public attention ) , Bernard never again painted with the vigor and originality of the Pont-Aven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941.
