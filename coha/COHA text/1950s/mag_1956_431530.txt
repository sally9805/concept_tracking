 | More " Preemies " Can Be Saved @# Mrs. JOHNSON , in the 32nd week of pregnancy , suddenly began to have labor pains . She was rushed to a hospital . That evening she gave birth to a three-and-ahalf-pound boy . Fourteen hours later the baby was dead . The death certificate listed the cause as " prematurity . " It might justifiably have read : Neglect . For the Johnson baby , placed in an incubator in the general nursery , had been left to strangle from phlegm he could n't swallow Had he been rushed to a special nursery for premature babies , nurses with special knowledge of premature-infant care would have treated the condition in time . Today doctors are conducting a sweeping crusade which is saving thousands of newborn , infants from death or deformity due to premature birth . Yet , largely because of ignorance and needless neglect , premature birth is still responsible for more infant deaths than any other cause . In 1954 more than 300,000 of @# America 's baby crop of four million were born prematurely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about 45,000 died before reaching their first birthday , most during the first month . Thousands of these deaths could and should have been prevented . A premature baby is one weighing five and a half pounds ( 2500 grams ) or less at birth , regardless of whether it is born at the normal nine-months period of gestation or before . Doctors decided on the 2500-gram point because there is a direct relation between birth weight and survival . Babies born weighing less than that are ordinarily not equipped to take up the struggle for survival without special care . The preemie is thrust into life with its blood and breathing systems , its digestive tract , its muscles and bones underdeveloped .

Hess learned that prematurely born babies were often rushed to these carnival incubators because community hospitals lacked such facilities . Hess bought an incubator from Dr. Couney , found it unsuitable for hospital use , and invented his own " Hess incubator . " From that beginning , he gradually developed special services for preemies , and established the center which today has 40 specially heated bassinets and incubators . The incubator , a unit which supplies a regulated flow of moist , warm air ( often with additional oxygen as needed ) and extra protection against infection , is vital to the smaller preemies .

About 15 years ago , doctors began to observe in newborn infants ? nearly all of them very small prematuresan eye condition resulting in blindness . Named retrolental fibroplasia by Dr. Theodore L. Terry of Harvard , who first observed it in 1941 , the condition was reported in a mature babies . A committee of the New York Academy of Medicine , in a report published in 1955 , estimated that more than a quarter of the deaths of premature infants studied in New York City could have been prevented by proper treatment ( In Chicago , veteran public-health director Dr. Herman N. Bundesen , Dr. Edith Potter of Chicago Lying-In Hospital and their colleagues revealed some of the outstanding causes of preemie deaths : improper handling of oxygen apparatus , failure to provide adequate incubator service with proper heat and humidity , unsanitary nursery conditions and lack of nurses specially trained in handling preemies . Fortunately a growing number of communities are setting up programs that demonstrate how these babies can be saved . In a dozen or more U.S. cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital nurseries for the care of prematurely born infants . A number have statewide ambulance service . The first of these centers was organized in 1922 at the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago by the  | tributed to world betterment . Isaac Newton was so tiny and weak when he was born in 1642 that the two midwives who delivered him predicted he would n't last the clay . Newton lived to become one of the mental giants of history and died at the ripe age of 85 . Jean Jacques Rousseau , Napoleon , Victor Hugo and Charles Darwin were prematures . The most renowned living preemie is Sir Winston Churchill . Most of the 48 states , stimulated tably that of a young eye specialist , by U.S. Children 's Bureau funds , Dr. Arnall Patz , in Washington and'Cr are now developing special preemiecare programs , with or without special nurseries . Many serve rural areas inaccessible to large hospitals .

Wherever these special programs have been instituted , significant cuts in the high preemie death rate have resulted . But experts agree that the main attack on the ills of prematurity ultimately must he in prevention of premature births . Until recently such prevention seemed but a distant hope , for doctors lacked adequate facts and figures . But in recent years the bio-statisticians and clinical researchers have been coming up with startling new data . sharply increasing number of cases , and by 1955 some 6500 American babies had been stricken with it . It was listed as the most frequent cause of blindness among pre-school children . Particularly alarming was the fact that most cases were occurring in the best hospital nurseries . Medical researchers worked feverishly to find its cause . Finally the culprit was tracked down by brilliant medical detective work in clinics , nurseries and laboratories ? noBaltimore , and Dr. Thaddeus S. Szewczyk , ophthalmologist of East St. Louis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to the excessive use of life-saving oxygen . Doctors , confident that oxygen could not possibly do any harm , were allowing it to be used indiscriminately ? too highly concentrated and for too long . Now they know it must be carefully regulated . Properly used , it can continue to save the lives of babies without blinding them . Since preemies have a somewhat higher rate of handicapping conditions , such as cerebral palsy , mental retardation , epilepsy and physical malformations , some may wonder if the struggle to save them is worth while . But this fundamental fact seems clear : The great majority of premature babies who survive infancy grow up into normal , healthy adulthood . Look at the long list of illustrious preemies who survived and con- For one thing , Dr. Jacob Yerushalmy , of the University of California School of Public Health , and other statistical experts found that mothers who had previously had difficult or unsuccessful pregnancies were especially likely to have preemies .

Nothing is so conducive to fullterm , normal birth as preservation of the mother 's health during pregnancy . Moreover , obstetricians are finding that many of the " emergency " deliveries that produce premature babies can be postponed by hospital care or intensive medical supervision of the expectant mother . As one authority puts it : " Every day spent in the mother 's womb gives the baby a better chance for survival . " The discovery of the relationship of prematurity and poor diet during pregnancy has opened a wide path to prevention . In a recent editorial the journal of the American Medical Association stated : " Although an inadequate diet is not the only cause of prematurity , it appears to be one of the most important and one that is frequently preventable . " The experiments of Dr. Winslow T. Tompkins and his associates at the Philadelphia Lying In Hospital constitute perhaps the most impressive demonstration of this nutritional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet containing large amounts of proteins , minerals and vitamins . To a similar number of expectant mothers , as a " control group , " they gave no special diet . Not a single case of prematurity occurred in the specialdiet group , while 37 cases were recorded in the control group . Dr. Ethel C. Dunham , a pioneer in demonstrating that many premature births are avoidable , points out that women suffering from chronic ailments such as high blood pressure , diabetes and tuberculosis are more likely to bear prematurely , and need special medical counsel and treatment . Another precaution expectant mothers can take : when exposed early in pregnancy to German measles , which can lead to congenital malformation and premature birth of the baby , they can seek immunization with gamma globulin . The spreading health and medical campaign against prematurity promises ultimate conquest of this longneglected killer and deformer of infants , with prospects of more and better babies , and less tragic frustration for parents . @#                 @ @ @ @
