txt A finance company economist foresaw " a strong possibility " that consumer instalment debt will decline this year for the first time since World War II . Speaking before a National Retail Credit Association regional meeting in South Bend , Ind. , Ernst A. Dauer , economist for Household Finance Corp , said such a decline " will occur if consumer confidence in the future deteriorates further . " He declared buyer confidence had already been weakened by such developments in recent months , such as the elimination of overtime in most industries , the widespread publicity given to layoffs and the uncertainty resulting from Sputnik . " On the basis of the evidence to date , a slight decline in consumer purchases of durable goods can be expected in 1958 , " Mr. Dauer said . " If that occurs the volume of consumer instalment credit creased in 1958 will be about the same as in 1957 , or slightly lower . " The decline , if it materializes , would take place in spite of easing credit terms and money supply , the economist indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer credit institutions which have an adequate equity to acquire all funds which are likely to be asked for by consumers , " he commented . Regarding the easing credit terms , Mr. Dauer warned against stretching maturities further . Citing rising automobile stocks , he said there might be a temptation on the part of dealers and manufacturers to lengthen terms , thus " selling terms rather than value . " Such a move , he cautioned , " may well stretch the buying cycle to four or five years . " He added that the proportion of 36-month maturities in automobile credit already is probably as high as at any time in the last two years . "
