txt From all accounts President Eisenhower and Treasury Secretary Anderson must really have laid it on the financial line in their secret meeting with Congressional leaders this week . It 's about time . For the Treasury 's difficulties , particularly with the public debt , are no longer just a problem but a crisis . The upshot of the meeting , according to the best estimates from Washington , may be a package request to Congress comprising : Removing or increasing the statutory 41/4 interest ceiling on longer-term Government bonds ; removing or raising the 314 % interest rate ceiling on savings bonds ; and increasing the public debt limit to $290 billion or $295 billion . Mr. ? Eisenhower told his press conference yesterday the Administration is seriously considering some such step . Whether the package goes to Congress exactly that way or not , the discussion of . such proposals represents a recognition of the plain reality that the Treasury can not continue trying to compete in today 's money markets under the crippling disadvantage of arbitrary interest-rate limits . More important , the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mess and reveals what the basic trouble really is . Savings bonds have been in difficulties for a long time , with the total outstanding declining as redemptions exceed sales . One reason is that people can get more for their money elsewhere , but a deeper reason is disillusionment with what inflation has done to these earnings in the past 20 years and the fear that the next 20 years will be equally dismaying . The market for other Government bonds has also been depressed . One reason is private competition for the lender 's dollar , but again the deeper reason is fear of inflation and a resultant desire to hedge by buying stocks instead of bonds . All this has enormously complicated the Treasury 's management of the public debt , which has been getting more complicated anyway because the debt is soaring . The Eisenhower Administration from the beginning wanted to put debt management on a much more orderly basis , specifically by shifting more of it into longer-term obligations in non-bank hands . But today the average maturity of the marketable debt is actually shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily on short-term offerings bought mainly by banks , a process which , apart from its other drawbacks , can be a direct generator of inflation . And , in the absence of correctives , this very bad situation will get rapidly worse . So we find inflation  --  past , present or feared  --  dominating all aspects of the Treasury 's mess . The genesis of that problem is nowhere else but in uncontrolled Federal spending unmatched by revenues , resulting in the deficits which both cause inflation and are shooting the public debt toward the $300 billion mark . The Treasury is caught in a tightening vise not of its making . It has been unable to manage the debt on a noninflationary basis ; ironically indeed it has been forced to foster the inflation Secretary Anderson wants to fight . The only way out of the vise is a sharp reduction in , and restoration of control over , Federal spending . We think it a credit to Mr. Eisenhower and Mr. Anderson to try to do something now in the face of a Congress dominated by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public that seems to have been almost persuaded the nation can go on indefinitely that way . Perhaps now everyone will at last begin to realize that the laws of common sense have not yet been repealed . It should be clear by now that the penalty for fiscal irresponsibility is not only inflation but a situation where the Government 's financial machinery finally can no longer function .
