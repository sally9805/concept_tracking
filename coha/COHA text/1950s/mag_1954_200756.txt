On Your Toes ( music &; lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart ; book by Rodgers , Hart and George Abbott ) is a good deal oftener on its uppers . The musical that in 1936 really put jazz ballet on Broadway , On Your Toes was perhaps from the start pretty much all thumbs where it was n't nifty footwork . Time has tended to merge the show and the ballet into one , but they are scarcely more alike than Buffalo and Niagara Falls . <P> Not that with its Balanchine choreography On Your Toes still has n't its points as a dance show . With its throbbing <P> Rodgers score , Slaughter on Tenth Avenue remains-when such ballets are no longer news-vibrant and exciting . There is a fine dancing rampage to go with the title song ; Zorina , in the part she played in London 17 years ago , still has grace and charm ; Bobby Van , in Ray Bolger 's old role , has much of the master 's ease and dexterity ; Elaine Stritch stops the show with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advantage of Me . But for notable stretches there is torpor on 46th Street . <P> There are very nice songs like There 's a Small Hotel , but Rodgers gave the show a ballet rather than top-drawer show music , and Hart gave it lyrics that tend to shout their cleverness . It is the Rodgers-Hart-Abbott libretto , however , that lays a curse upon the evening-the look , if ever there was one , of three men on an elephant .
