txt // of any desire to convince , that what he is about to tell us is true . His audience is already half hypnotized with the first sentence . In this regard , Chekhov is obviously in the tradition of the Goncourts , with their " human documents , " and of Gogol : he was a contemporary of Maupassant in more than mere moment . The theory of the " slice of life " was , at that moment , the thing , and Chekhov , with Maupassant , remains as the chief exemplar , in the short story , of that theory . Yet that theory as it worked through Chekhov is not what it was as it worked through Maupassant : a world of difference sunders the two men . Basically , the difference lies in the fact that Maupassant was a logician of the short story , and Chekhov a poet . Maupassant 's mere " mechanics " arc superb ; far better than Chekhov 's . There is no waste , his items are well chosen and " clear " ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logically overwhelming ; he makes his case with a miracle of cold dexterity . Grant his hypothesis , his Q. E. D. will punctually flower . There is little of this in Chekhov . His stories have not this flat , swift trajectory , are not logically " rounded , " do not move , as narratives , to an overwhelming provided conclusion , through an unalterable certainty which one has been permitted , or rather compelled , now and again terrifyingly to feel . Many of his stories do not , in this sense , conclude at all ? they merely stop . In fact , the conclusion in itself did not interest Chekhov . He did not desire to emphasize , as Maupassant emphasized , the " final " event , nor , indeed , any single event ; his method was more copious , and his concern was not so much with the possibility that in this copiousness a narrative current should be felt , as with the certainty that through it should be perceived a living being or group of beings , beings through whose rich consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backward and forward , in time , lives as appallingly genuine as our own . Here we reach naturally the question of psychology , and must observe that while Maupassant 's characters obey a logic in this regard , obey it mechanically , like marionettes , and have no life apart from it , Chekhov 's characters are complex , indeterminate , diffuse a consciousness wider than the bounds of the particular event in which we see them participating : they come to it from " somewhere " ( we know only vaguely where ) , and depart from it for somewhere else . This is due not merely to the fact that Chekhov is more concerned with the effect of ( 1921 ) Anton Chekhov 151 " actuality " than with " story , " to the fact that , as was said above , he was a poet . His sensibilities were rich and of an immense range , had thrust their roots , one dares to think , almost as widely and deeply into life as Shakespeare 's : his understanding was unsurpassed , and if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lack of that faculty . No artist has known , by introspection , more " states of mind , " no artist has known better , by observation , what shapes they assume in talk or behaviour . This , after all , is Chekhov 's genius ? he was a master of mood . His stories offer not only an extraordinary panorama of scenes , actions , situations but , more importantly , a range of states of consciousness which is perhaps unparalleled . It was this pluralism , this awareness of the many-sidedness of life , that sent him to the short story rather than to the novel , and made of his longer stories , as he himself says , mere accumulations . These accumulations ? " A Dreary Story , " " My Life , " " The Steppe " ? do not disintegrate , as the short stories do not , simply because , like the short stories , they depend for unity not on the formal working of a theme , but on verisimilitude , on the never-diminishing saturation of consciousness in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unity of tone . If we evade for the moment the question of the precise value , in fiction , of the " actual , " and of the extent to which it may be permitted to supplant all other values , and evade , also for the moment , the question of the kind of actuality toward which Chekhov felt a compulsion , it is perhaps profitable to note how interesting are the aesthetic problems raised by the effort to capture , in fiction , that tone . We have already observed that Chekhov instinctively or consciously uses , at the outset of a story and throughout , a colloquial tone ? he is never better than when he tells his story in the first person singular . He wishes , in other words , to keep the pitch of the story down , to diminish what is called " the psychic distance " ; his picture is to be frameless and immediate , so close to us that we can touch it . He does not want us to be conscious of his style , nor of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes just as they are , neither larger nor smaller than life . Every trace of sympathy must therefore be excluded : " When you depict sad or unlucky people try to be colder ? it gives their grief , as it were , a background . . . . Yes , you must be cold . . . . Every trace of stylization , of heightening , must be expunged .... Beauty and expressiveness in Nature are attained only by simplicity , by such simple phrases as The sun set , ' It was // dark , " It began to rain , ' and so on . . . . " In everything we see the avoidance of the phrase , the detail , the attitude , the sense of " frame " of " scheme , " which might mitigate the effect of immediacy . " But of the word art ' I am terrified .... " No wonder ? by art he meant conscious art , and Chekhov was only intermittently a conscious artist ; he knew that he was at his best when , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he gave himself up to rapid improvisation , an improvisation which took the form of a complete surrender to that face , that incident , a submersion of the senses . This , of course , was his art ? an art , of its sort , perfect . Yet we come back to question again the extent to which this effect of overwhelming actuality may be permitted to supplant other effects ? the effects , for example , of an art more deliberate , more conscious . The two sorts of art ( " two " if we take merely the extremes , say , Chekhov and Henry James ) are not of course mutually exclusive , there will be room for both ; the generation , like the individual , will make its natural choice and rationalize its choice ex post facto . Yet if we need not necessarily at the instant choose between them , it is none the less fruitful to observe their distinguishing characteristics , and we can do no better at the outset than to quote Henry James himself , speaking , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this question of the degree in which mere immersion in the actual may be sufficient . Yes , yes ? but is this all ? These are the circumstances of the interest ? we see , we see ; but where is the interest itself , where and what is its center , and how are we to measure it in relation to that ? . . . That appreciation is . . . a mistake and a priggishness , being reflective and thereby corrosive , is another of the fond dicta which we are here concerned but to brush aside . . . appreciation , attentive and reflective , inquisitive and conclusive , is in this connection absolutely the golden key to our pleasure . This is a statement of a theory of art so antithetical to that of Chekhov ( insofar as he consciously entertained one ) , that it is reasonable to suppose that he simply would not have understood it . Here we have an artist who not only selects one from among many themes because it is richest in possibilities of being " worked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment the " working " of it , to look , as it were , at the back of the clock no less often than at its face , so that he may know not merely what it says but how it says it . This is a ( 1921 ) Anton Chekhov 153 pleasure to which Chekhov does not invite us : to make that invitation is , in the same breath , to take a deliberate step away from the " actual . " Compare Chekhov 's In the Ravine with Turgenev 's A Lear of the Steppes . The themes have much in common . But whereas Chekhov has richly and beautifully improvised , always in the key of the actual , giving us an immense number of scenes , dialogues , persons , all of them palpitantly real and caught in an exquisite , quiet beauty of tone , Turgenev has gone more deliberately to work : he strikes sharply , even artificially , his " theme " in the opening , giving us thus in advance a glimpse of the whole , and then proceeds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate exaggerations ? he aims not at the immediate but at the distant , slightly distorted by a trick of atmosphere ; not at the actual , but at the larger than the actual . One feels the artificiality , certainly ; but one enjoys it , and in retrospect it is the Turgenev story that one clearly remembers , not the Chekhov story . Harlov we still see , but we do not even recall the name of Chekhov 's Lear , any more than we see him as a person . He was living as long as we read of him ? more so perhaps than Harlov . That whole life , in which Chekhov drowned us , how beautiful , resonant , full of echoes it was , how aromatically it ended ! But it is our joy in the tone of it that we recall , and not the things that created that tone . We come back , therefore , to the point from which we started , to a clear realization that Chekhov was in essence a poet , a poet of the actual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek character , perhaps ? more precisely , to seek mood , state of mind ; he profoundly knew the duality , the light , the timbre , the fluctuations of mood , particularly those of a melancholy tinge ; and if , in retrospect , we find that his characters have an odd way of evaporating , it is because so often our view of them was never permitted for a moment to be external ? we saw them only as infinitely fine and truthful sequences of mood . Chekhov was great because his sensibilities were of sufficient range to enable him to apply this method almost universally . His sympathy , his pity , his tenderness , were inexhaustible . He lived , and thus permitted us to live , everywhere . DOOLITTLE , HILDA ( H.D. ) ( 1927 ) Despite one 's very great respect for H.D. 's poetry ? and respect is perhaps the word , for it is a poetry which never warms or excites , but at its best elicits ( rather ) a cool intense admiration in which feelings are suspended ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her novel , if novel it can be called , came as a surprise . One is tempted to say that the world of Palimpsest and the world of poetry are two entirely different things . That would be convenient , but it is not quite exact ; for it is , of course , easy enough to trace , in the prodigal and sometimes disheveled magnificence of the prose , the hard , and occasionally too neat , small objectiveness of the verse . Nevertheless , one can not evade the feeling that in prose H.D. is a much more impressive and disturbing person than in verse : which is tantamount to saying that she has a great deal more to express than she found it remotely possible to express in the somewhat narrow , somewhat precious , poetic mode which she had invented for herself . One can only guess , idly , at the reasons for this ? one supposes that she had some queer idee fixe as to what sort of thing poetry should or should not be ; that it should not , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or too lavish of colored phrase ; that it should be spare , and hint rather coldly at its ardors , and perhaps be also a little asymmetrical in design . Whatever the reasons for these odd inhibitions , it is obvious enough that she has inverted the usual procedure , and has found in the prose of Palimpsest a far deeper emotional release and escape , and therefore a more intimate mode of expression , than her verse has ever afforded her . She takes at last the plunge ? she delivers herself at last completely to the whole range of intensities of feeling and perception , which , in her poetry ( she had the air of saying ) were things a little too frightening , things that had better be run from , and mentioned , if mentioned at all , a little breathlessly . And the result is a novel which invites comparison with the very best fiction which has been written , in any language , in this century . Of H.D. 's debts and affinities one need not say too much , beyond noting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third part ) and to Joyce ( in the second part ) ? sometimes a shade too palpably echoing the styles of those two writers , especially James . Of her theme , one need only remark that it perhaps ( 1927 ) Hilda Doolittle ( H.D. ) 155 carries a little too far toward the esoteric , perhaps toward the mystic ( in its suggestion of recurring personalities and situations , or even reincarnations ) , its elaborate analysis of the queer oppressiveness of the sense of the past . One would like to be surer than one is that H.D. does not take all this too seriously . If , in this regard , one gives her the benefit of the doubt , then one has little left but praise . The three long episodes of which the novel is made ? one in ancient Rome , one in postwar London , one in modem Egypt ? are given us with a richness and vividness , an unintermittent saturation of verisimilitude , and a balancing of the objectively beautiful with the psychologically true , which one would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elisions and abruptnesses ? which pull one up , and occasionally carelessnesses ( split infinitives , modern French phrases in the Roman section , and other small matters ) in the midst of a prose so beautiful as to make such errors glaring ; and one notes again , as one always notes of the " stream of consciousness " method , that one now and then founders a little in the fragmentary and chaotic and repetitive welter of the interior monologue . One would have preferred , in the second section , a little more stiffening ? more of the direct narrative ( retrospected or vaticaly projected ) , and less of the obsessed round-and-round of the heroine 's mind , which sometimes , in its endless repetitions of certain leit-motifs , goes beyond the limits of the credible , as also of the aesthetically endurable . Nor need the first part have been quite so bristlingly and barbedly archaistic in order to attain a flavor as of the " classic . " But these are minor objections , and so is one 's feeling that H.D. overdoes a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parenthetic questions , parenthetic reminiscences ? one feels , in the midst of this burning subjectivism , this consuming Narcissism , that it would be a relief to come oftener upon a simple narrative statement or a connected bit of dialogue . And one is sure that this need not have diminished in the slightest the extraordinary evocativeness of this prose , nor in the least have impeded H.D. 's remarkably subtle apprehension of mood and feeling , and the logical sequences of mood and feeling that we call character . DICKINSON , EMILY ( 1924 ) Emily Dickinson was born in Amherst , Massachusetts , on December loth , 183o . She died there , after a life perfectly devoid of outward event , in 1886 . She was thus an exact contemporary of Christina Rossetti , who was born five days earlier than she , and outlived her by eight years . Of her life we know little . Her father , Edward Dickinson , was a lawyer , and the Treasurer of Amherst College ; and it is clear that what social or intellectual life was in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not choose to avail herself of it , except in very slight degree , is also clear ; and that this choice , which was gradually to make of her life an almost inviolable solitude , was made early , is evident from her Letters . In a letter dated 1853 , when she was twenty-three years old , she remarked , " I do not go from home . " By the time she was thirty , the habit of sequestration had become distinct , a subject on which she was explicit and emphatic in her letters to T. W. Higginson ? editor of the Atlantic Monthly at that time . She made it clear that if there was to be any question of a meeting between them , he would have to come to Amherst ? she would not go to Boston . Higginson , as a matter of fact , saw her twice , and his record of the encounter is practically the only record we have of her from any " literary " personage of her lifetime . Even this is meager ? Higginson saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtly gentleman , able editor , he was too much of the old school not to be a little puzzled by her poetry ; and if he was fine enough to guess the fineness , he was not quite fine enough wholly to understand it . The brief correspondence between these two is an extraordinary document of unconscious irony ? the urbanely academic editor reproaching his wayward pupil for her literary insubordination , her false quantities and reckless liberties with rhyme ; the wayward pupil replying with a humility , beautiful and pathetic , but remaining singularly , with unmalleable obstinacy , herself . " I saw her , " wrote Higginson , " but twice , face to face , and brought away the impression of something as unique and remote as Undine or Mignon or Thekla . " When , thirty years after the acquaintance had begun , and four after Emily Dickinson 's death , he was called upon to edit a selection from her poetry , practically none of which had been published during her lifetime , his scruples were less severe , and he spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Emily Dickinson 157 all , " he then wrote , " when a thought takes one 's breath away , a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence . " Again , " In many cases these verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots . " And again , " a quality more suggestive of the poetry of Blake than of anything to be elsewhere found ? flashes of wholly original and profound insight into nature and life . " Thus began and ended Emily Dickinson 's only important connection with the literary life of her time . She knew , it is true , Helen Hunt Jackson , a poetess , for whose anthology , A Masque of Poets , she gave the poem " Success , " one of the few poems she allowed publication during her life . And she knew the Bowles family , owners and editors of The Springfield Republican , at that time the Manchester Guardian of New England ? which , as she put it mischievously , was one of " such papers ... as have nothing carnal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aside from these she had few intimates outside of her family ; the circle of her world grew steadily smaller . This is a point of cardinal importance , but unfortunately no light has been thrown upon it . It is apparent that Miss Dickinson became a hermit by deliberate and conscious choice . " A recluse , " wrote Higginson , " by temperament and habit , literally spending years without setting her foot beyond the doorstep , and many more years during which her walks were strictly limited to her father 's grounds , she habitually concealed her mind , like her person , from all but a very few friends ; and it was with great difficulty that she was persuaded to print , during her lifetime , three or four poems . " One of the co-editors of Poems : Second Series assures us that this voluntary hermitage was not due to any " love-disappointment , " and that she was " not an invalid . " " She had tried society and the world , and had found them lacking . " But this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us convincingly that her girlhood was a normally " social " one ? she was active , highspirited , and endowed with a considerable gift for extravagant humor . As a young woman she had , so Mrs. Bianchi , a niece , informs us in the preface to The Single Hound , several love affairs . But we have no right , without other testimony , to assume here any ground for the singular psychological change that came over her . The only other clue we have , of any sort , is the hint from one of her girlhood friends , that perhaps " she was longing for poetic sympathy . " Perhaps ! But we must hope that her relatives and literary executives will eventually see fit to publish all her literary remains , verse and prose , and to give us thus , perhaps , a good deal more light on the nature of her life . // Anecdotes relating to her mischievousness , her wit , her waywardness , are not enough . It is amusing , if horrifying , to know that once , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a shovel , carried them into the cellar , and dropped them into the nearest jar ? which , subsequently , on the occasion of the visit of a distinguished judge , turned out to have been the pickle-jar . We like to know too , that even when her solitude was most remote she was in the habit of lowering from her window , by a string , small baskets of fruit or confectionery for children . But there are other things we should like to know much more . There seems , however , little likelihood of our being told , by her family , anything more ; and if we seek for the causes of the psychic injury which so sharply turned her in upon herself , we can only speculate . IIcr letters , in this regard , give little light , only showing us again and again that the injury was deep . Of the fact that she suffered acutely from intellectual drought there is evidence enough . One sees her vividly here ? but one sees her , as it were , perpetually in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual limitations of her correspondents ; she is discreet , pathetic , baffled , a little humbled , and draws in her horns ; takes sometimes a perverse pleasure in indulging more than ever , on the occasion of such a disappointment , in her love of a cryptic style ? a delicate bombardment of parable and whim which she perfectly knows will stagger ; and then again retreats to the safe ground of the superficial . It is perhaps for this reason that the letters give us so remarkably little information about her literary interests . The meagerness of literary allusion is astounding . The Brontes and the Brownings are referred to ? she thought Alexander Smith " not very coherent " ? Joaquin Miller she " could not care about . " Of her own work she speaks only in the brief unsatisfactory correspondence with Higginson . To him she wrote in 1863 , " I wrote no verse , but one or two , until this winter . " Otherwise , no scrap of her own literary history : she appears to have existed in a vacuum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taking place during her most impressionable years , there is hardly a mention . Emerson was at the height of his career , and living only sixty miles away : his poems came out when she was seventeen . When she was twenty , Hawthorne published The Scarlet Letter , and The House of Seven Gables the year after . The same year , 1851 , brought out Melville 's Moby Dick . The death of Poe took place in 1849 ? in 185o was ( 1924 ) Emily Dickinson 159 published the first collected edition of his poems . When she was twenty-four , Thoreau 's Walden appeared ; when she was twentyfive , Leaves of Grass . One can say with justice that she came to full " consciousness " at the very moment when American literature came to flower . That she knew this , there can not be any question ; nor that she was stimulated and influenced by it . One must assume that she found in her immediate environment no one of her own stature , with whom she could admit or discuss such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage out into the unknown in search of such companionship ; and that , lacking this courage , and wanting this help , she became easily a prey to the then current Emersonian doctrine of mystical Individualism . In this connection it is permissible to suggest that her extreme self-seclusion and secrecy was both a protest and a display ? a kind of vanity masquerading as modesty . She became increasingly precious , of her person as of her thought . Vanity is in her letters ? at the last an unhealthy vanity . She believes that anything she says , however brief , will be of importance ; however cryptic , will be deciphered . She enjoys being something of a mystery , and she sometimes deliberately and awkwardly exaggerates it . Even in notes of condolence ? for which she had a morbid passion ? she is vain enough to indulge in sententiousness : as when she wrote , to a friend whose father had died on her wedding-day , " Few daughters have the immortality of a father for a bridal gift . " When-we come to Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , but perfectly Miss Dickinson 's . Henry James observed of Emerson : The doctrine of the supremacy of the individual to himself , of his originality and , as regards his own character , unique quality , must have had a great charm for people living in a society in which introspection , thanks to the want of other entertainment , played almost the part of a social resource . . . . There was . . . much relish for the utterances of a writer who would help one to take a picturesque view of one 's internal possibilities , and to find in the landscape of the soul all sorts of fine sunrise and moonlight effects . This sums up admirably the social " case " of Miss Dickinson ? it gives us a shrewd picture of the causes of her singular introversion , and it suggests that we are perhaps justified in considering her the most perfect flower of New England Transcendentalism . In her mode of life she carried the doctrine of self-sufficient individualism farther than Thoreau carried it , or the naive 16o A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry she carried it , with its complement of passionate moral mysticism , farther than Emerson : which is to say that as a poet she had more genius than he . Like Emerson , whose essays must greatly have influenced her , and whose poetry , especially his gnomic poems , only a little less , she was from the outset , and remained all her life , a singular mixture of Puritan and freethinker . The problems of good and evil , of life and death , obsessed her ; the nature and destiny of the human soul ; and Emerson 's theory of compensation . Toward God , as one of her earliest critics is reported to have said , " she exhibited an Emersonian self-possession . " Indeed , she did not , and could not , accept the Puritan God at all . She was frankly irreverent , on occasion , a fact which seems to have made her editors a little uneasy ? one hopes that it has not resulted in the suppression of any of her work . What she was irreverent to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Puritan attitude toward him . Heavenly father , take to thee The supreme iniquity , Fashioned by thy candid hand In a moment contraband . Though to trust us seems to us More respectful , ? we are dust . We apologize to thee For thine own Duplicity . This , it must be repeated , is Emily Dickinson 's opinion of the traditional and anthropomorphic " God , " who was still , in her day , a portentous Victorian gentleman . Her real reverence , the reverence that made her a mystic poet of the finest sort , was reserved for Nature , which seemed to her a more manifest and more beautiful evidence of Divine Will than creeds and churches . This she saw , observed , loved , with a burning simplicity and passion which nevertheless did not exclude her very agile sense of humor . Her Nature poems , however , are not the most secretly revelatory or dramatically compulsive of her poems , nor on the whole , the best . They are often of extraordinary delicacy ? nearly always give us , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , also , they are often superficial , a mere affectionate playing with the smaller things that give her delight ; and to see her at her best and most characteristic and most profound , one must turn to the remarkable range of metaphysical speculation and ironic introspection which is displayed ( 1924 ) Emily Dickinson 161 in those sections of her posthumous books which her editors have captioned Life , and Time and Eternity . In the former sections are the greater number of her set " meditations " on the nature of things . For some critics they will always appear too bare , bleak , and fragmentary . They have no trappings , only here and there a shred of purple . It is as if Miss Dickinson , who in one of her letters uttered her contempt for the " obtrusive body , " had wanted to make them , as nearly as possible , disembodied thought . The thought is there , at all events , hard , bright , and clear ; and her symbols , her metaphors , of which she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is also there is a downright homeliness which is a perpetual surprise and delight . Emerson 's gnomic style she tunes up to the epigrammatic ? the epigrammatic she often carries to the point of the cryptic ; she becomes what one might call an epigrammatic symbolist . Lay this laurel on the one Too intrinsic for renown . Laurel ! veil your deathless tree , ? Him you chasten , that is lie ! This , from Poems : Second Series , verges perilously on the riddle . And if often happens that her passionate devotion to concise statement in terms of metaphor left for her readers a small rich emblem of which the colors tease , the thought entices , but the meaning escapes . Against this , however , should be set her capacity , when occasion came , for a granite simplicity , any parallel to which one must seek in the seventeenth century . This , for example , called " Parting . " My life closed twice before its close ; It yet remains to see If Immortality unveil A third event to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these that twice befell . Parting is all we know of heaven And all we need of hell . Or this , from The Single Hound : Not any sunny tone From any fervent zone Finds entrance there . Better a grave of Balm // Toward human nature 's home , And Robins near , Than a stupendous Tomb Proclaiming to the gloom How dead we are . Both these poems , it will be noted , deal with death ; and it must be observed that the number of poems by Miss Dickinson on this subject is one of the most remarkable things about her . Death , and the problem of life after death , obsessed her . She seems to have thought of it constantly ? she died all her life , she probed death daily . " That bareheaded life under grass worries one like a wasp , " she wrote . Ultimately , the obsession became morbid , and her eagerness for details , after the death of a friend ? the hungry desire to know how she died ? became almost vulture-like . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortality , its hatred of the flesh , and its many reversals of both positions ? gave us her sharpest work . The theme was inexhaustible for her . If her poetry seldom became " lyrical , " seldom departed from the colorless sobriety of its bare iambics and toneless assonance , it did so most of all when the subject was death . Death profoundly and cruelly invited her . It was most of all when she tried " to touch the smile , " and dipped her " fingers in the frost , " that she took full possession of her genius . Her genius was , it remains to say , as erratic as it was brilliant . Her disregard for accepted forms or for regularities was incorrigible . Grammar , rhyme , meter ? anything went by the board if it stood in the way of thought or freedom of utterance . Sometimes this arrogance was justified ; sometimes not . She did not care in the least for variety of effect ? of her six hundred-odd poems , practically all are in octosyllabic quatrains or couplets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with neither . Everywhere , when one first comes to these poems , one seems to see nothing but a colorless dry monotony . How deceptive a monotony , concealing what reserves of depth and splendor ; what subtleties of mood and tone ! Once adjust oneself to the spinsterly angularity of the mode , its lack of eloquence or rhetorical speed , its naive and often prosaic directness , one discovers felicities of thought and phrase on every page . The magic is terse and sure . And ultimately one simply sighs at Miss Dickinson 's singular perversity , her lapses and tyrannies , and accepts them as an inevitable part of the strange and original genius she was . The lapses and tyrannies become ( 1921 ) Feodor Dostoevsky 163 a positive charm ? one even suspects they were deliberate . They satisfied her ? therefore they satisfy us . This marks , of course , our complete surrender to her highly individual gift , and to the singular sharp beauty , present everywhere , of her personality . The two things can not be separated ; and together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the finest poets in the language . DOSTOEVSKY , FEODOR ( 1921 ) The two novels which make up the twelfth volume in Mrs. Garnett 's translation of Dostoevsky , The Friend of the Family , were published ten years apart ? the title-story in 1859 , the year in which Dostoevsky finally obtained permission to return from Siberia to St. Petersburg , and Nyetochka Nyezvanov in 1849 , the year of his arrest and imprisonment . They are both remarkable productions ; they have both been somewhat slighted by critics , simply , one supposes , because they are , naturally , less remarkable than The Idiot or Crime and Punishment or The Brothers Karamazov . They share , they show , nonetheless , their author 's genius ? they are , despite their " age , " more sharply " modern " ? a term by which one presumably means fine and searching in a psychological sense ? than anything present-day American fiction can show , for all its advantage , in point of time , of seventy years . They have also , for those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , their special points : The Friend of the Family , written about two years before The Idiot , contains the prototype of Myshkin , and adumbrates , faintly but clearly , that whole later series of novels in which one overhears the dialogue between good and evil , faith and cynicism , altruism and egotism . Nyetochka Nyezvanov , too , is important , among other reasons , if only because it shows us clearly a Dostoevsky who already , before his imprisonment , was conspicuously , for the eyes of a psychologist , marked ; although of course , even before this , Bielinsky the Russian critic , had said , " What he needs is medical attention . " Critics of an academic cast , critics for whom literary values approximate the absolute , and for whom art is a kind of religion , profoundly distrust any attempt to trace aspects of a work of // art to the psychic disequilibration of the artist . Dostoevsky has especially , at the hands of his admirers , come in for this kind of shielding . Again , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely , who see in Dostoevsky not merely an artist but also , and perhaps more importantly , a prophet , a seer . Thus , Mr. J. Middleton Murry , in his book on Dostoevsky , attacks the notion of ascribing to epilepsy any relevant effect on Dostoevsky 's work , and ridicules it as not merely stooping to " the unpardonable methods of a Nordau " but also as confounding cause with effect : Mr. Murry prefers , despite all the evidence , to believe that it was exactly the strain of literary creation which brought on the active phase of the epilepsy . The facts are , of course , that Dostoevsky inherited a tendency to hysteria ; that the disorder manifested itself even in his boyhood ; that even before he was sent to Siberia he was a confirmed hypochondriac , who reveled in searching medical books for " symptoms " ; and finally that , whether or not in later life the worry and prolonged intellectual effort contributed to the increasing violence of his attacks , none the less he was already an epileptic , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imply . Writing at the age of twenty-seven , to his brother Michael , Dostoevsky , after mentioning a marked increase in his " nervous irritability " ( a precise characteristic of the epileptic ) went on to say : " Whenever formerly I had such nervous disturbances , I made use of them for writing ; in such a state I could write much more and much better than usual . " This gives us a Dostoevsky who is capable of exploiting his disease . Not for nothing was he a hypochondriac . His descriptions , again and again , of hysterical states of mind are of unparalleled exactitude and vividness . Of the causes of epilepsy little is known ; of its effects , which are obvious , let me quote Dr. J. F. Munson , in an article on epilepsy in the Modern Treatment of Mental and Nervous Diseases of Drs . White and Jelliffe : The characteristic features of the disease influence the life of the afflicted individual in every particular . . . . There are practically no epileptics without some mental change . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits of mind and character which exist independent of the seizure . . . Aschaffenburg lays special stress on the variations of the physical condition ( mood ) which may occur independent of attacks . Grasset characterizes them more harshly , but with much truth , ( 1921 ) Feodor Dostoevsky 165 and indirectly points out the variability of the epileptic 's psychic condition : On the one hand , they are sombre , taciturn , defiant , suspicious , always ready to fly into a passion , to hurt people , to become enraged , and to strike ; on the other hand , they are contrary , obsequious , obliging , wheedlesome , full of effusion and gentleness . In reality , epileptics are all , or nearly all , irritable , subject to attacks of sudden , violent and ferocious transports of rage , during which they do not , as it were , belong to themselves . This irritability is the keynote of their character . Many have , in addition , vices and perverse instincts . . . . They frequently have a tendency to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hypocrisy . . . . Add to this that epileptics are further described as " full of contradictions and contrasts " ; unstable ; that ideas of religion are common during the seizure ; that there is apt to be a complete disorientation of time and place ; and that in the delirium " the ideas often assume a mystic character and are associated with a state of euphoria which may reach the intensity of ecstasy , " and we have a fairly complete clinical picture of the epileptic . What is more , we have a fairly recognizable portrait of the Feodor Dostoevsky who emerges for us in the novels and letters , so recognizable that it must be impossible for the intelligent critic to ignore it . Can we , in this light , follow such a critic as Mr. Murry , who would have us regard Dostoevsky as a seer , as a leader of thought , one who will take us beautifully into a new intellectual realm in which the truth is especially luminous ? What we must have , in a leader of this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , as Mr. Murry does , by endeavoring , as it were , to discredit " sanity " on the witness-stand . Sanity is a relative thing , true enough , it is the relative freedom of the sound mind in the sound body . In the case of Dostoevsky this freedom was impaired by a specific cause of which , happily , we know the specific effects . It is no use setting up , as Mr. Murry does , Dostoevsky 's " timelessness " and " mystic terror " and excessive religious humanitarianism as absolute virtues , for we can not help seeing them as products of a disease . Tuberculosis makes its victims optimistic , but we do not necessarily accept their views of life . Why , then , should we accept , as something ex cathedra , the turbid mysticism , the febrile hypochondria , of Dostoevsky ? We might as well adore the disease that produced them . // No , we find it impossible to accept as a seer , as a thinker , one on whom the stigma of psychic compulsion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compulsive nature of the artist 's ideas . But if that means that we can not take too seriously his " ideas , " it does not mean that we can not take him seriously as an artist , as a creator , whether it is only to see in him , as Mr. Hueffer does , " a portentous writer of enormous detective stories , " or to see in him , as many other critics have done , the greatest of all novelists . Granted that he was , as Mr. Murry says , the " most sensitive soul " which the modern world has produced , he was also an injured soul , and his novels are the profuse , extraordinary record of that injury , the bewildered confession of an acutely sensitive but grievously wounded sensorium . Seen in this light , especially , but indeed seen in any light , his novels are " dreams " : confused , wandering , crowded ; lighted everywhere with the red light of fever . Dostoevsky himself admitted more than once that he had little " control " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his letters , his difficulties with The Possessed , in which a new hero , one who had originally been designed for a somewhat minor role , took possession of the novel ; he speaks elsewhere of the " shapelessness " of his stories ; he reproaches those who demand of a man in his circumstances , " lucid art , effortless and untroubled poetry " ; but he comes no nearer to lucidity or to the untroubled in The Brothers Karamazov , the only one of his novels composed at leisure . His novels are , in fact , dreams in a Freudian sense , since they are the projection , again and again , of his own difficulties in life . His characters all verge on the hysterical or epileptic ? some of them project , as it were , one phase of the disease , and some another . It is possible to carry too far this theory of genesis , but one hardly hesitates in ascribing to epileptic mysticism and euphoria the origins of Myshkin , of Sonia , of Alyosha , as one also is prone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " evil " or perverse phases of epilepsy , the origins of Rogozhin , Raskolnikov , Svidrigailov . One need not simplify excessively ? there are other factors to be considered . There is , for example , Dostoevsky 's metaphysical preoccupation with the problem of good and evil , a problem which essentially provides the core of all his greatest work : the theme , if we see it in abstract , of The Idiot , The Possessed , Crime and Punishment , The Brothers Karamazov ; the theme , for once explicitly , of Notes from Underground . But do we not see the stigma of disease , once more , precisely in this excessive ( 1921 ) Feodor Dostoevsky 167 morbid preoccupation ? It was a problem with which Dostoevsky was obsessed ; the sense of " evil " rode him like a demon , a protean demon which at one moment was the monstrous symbol of pain , at another the symbol of the sense of horror and futility which arises from too acute a consciousness of the blank , empty , and indifferent determinism in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latter sensation , Dostoevsky went extraordinarily far ? has anyone been more conscious , as it were , of consciousness , or so singularly and persistently endeavored to shed the light inward on himself ? The tissue of that analysis is a marvel of impalpability , the logical filaments are luminous and exquisite , and we only begin to see the fundamental error when we see that the logic is more often one of sensation or feeling than one of thought , and that the datum from which it all grows is the assumption , natural only to the injured and abnormal mind , that the measure of one 's " awareness " is precisely the measure of one 's " disgust . " But we need not subscribe to Dostoevsky 's ideas to delight in his novels ? we are wise if we accept them simply as amazing psychotic improvisations on a theme , psychological symphonies of unparalleled sensitiveness and richness ; and if we are bound to wonder whether their characteristic extravagant vehemence is not a hint that the composition of them was often precisely an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the slightest our delight in abandoning ourselves to the torrent . What we come to is the fact that the later novels are not a transcription or representation of our actual world ? they have their contact with it , obviously , their roots in it , but they flower , remotely and strangely , in another and translunar atmosphere . They approach , by this kind of singular abstraction and attenuated con. tact with the real , an " absoluteness " in fiction which we can perhaps only parallel , odd as the parallel seems , with the later novels of Henry James ? The Golden Bowl , The Wings of the Dove , The Awkward Age , What Maisie Knew , The Ambassadors . I do not suggest any such absurdity as that these novels resemble , in any other remotest particular , Crime and Punishment or The Brothers Karamazov . Dostoevsky did not , as James did , calculate his effect ; he was not even aware of it . He asked , in one of his letters , " Is not my fantastic Idiot the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ; nor do we wish it to be . It is perhaps something better than the truth . EBERHART , RICHARD ' ( 1945 ) That much of contemporary poetry is written rather for the eye than for the ear ? even , perhaps the greater part of it ? has been often observed , and that it constitutes a grievous loss to the poetry itself can not , one thinks , be seriously questioned . And the loss is not a simple one , either . It is not merely a matter of sacrificing a certain sensuous or decorative quality , or combination of qualities , for whatever compensating virtues of exactness , austerity , unsentimentality , easy colloquialism : it is not merely beauty of form , beauty of sound , that is flung out so ruthlessly in this passion for the antipoetic : it is , on the contrary , in a very important measure the sense , the meaning , which gets itself inadvertently flung out , like the baby with the bath . Poetry , alas , is not science , it is not statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not philosophy , it is not music . It may and should incorporate elements of these , but it can never attain to the cold , pure abstractness which is the principle they have in common without ipso facto ceasing to be itself . For the meaning of poetry , like the meaning of language itself , is double : it consists of both sense and sound : and paradoxically it might well be argued that the sense , the poetic sense , is more in the sound than in the so-called or obvious " meaning . " It is precisely in the sound-effects , or more properly the sound-affects , and in its deliberate use of the feeling-tones and associations inherent in them , that poetry most characteristically takes its departure from prose . It is thus a perpetual renewal of language . It remembers that language is oral , that it must be whispered or spoken or shouted or sung , and that it is only in the knowing and ordering of these affective soundvalues that language again becomes whole and our meaning complete . After science , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy and music , poetry has the last word . In poetry , could it not be maintained ? always comes man 's final statement , at whatever point in the evolution of his awareness . It is the whole speech of the whole man . The feelings , the affects , are again reincorporated at a new level , no matter how complex the statement , and we speak once more as we should and must : not only of what we know , but also of ( 1945 ) Richard Eberhart 169 what we consciously , and even unconsciously , feel about what we know . To neglect or despise sound-values , therefore , is , practically speaking , to use only one half of the poetic language , and to the poet 's cost . Impatient he may be with certain kinds of effect , for there are changing fashions in these as in all matters of form ; but if he discards he must also invent . Mr. Eberhart , for example , shows that he is very much aware of this necessity , and even concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his new selection that he is any nearer to his private solution . His " Groundhog " remains one of the most remarkable of contemporary poems , its Blakian intensity and fierceness of vision unimpaired , if not actually enhanced , by the wanton roughness of form , the perverse metrics ; and the variant of it which appears in " Triptych , " recast in the key of Jacobean canting and ranting , is almost as good . But Mr. Eberhart , either because his ear is defective or because he is overanxious to avoid the merely smooth , makes the not uncommon mistake of establishing violence and perversity as his norm , with the inevitable result that where everything shrieks and clashes , the uproar at last cancels itself out , and it is as if nothing had been heard at all . This is a great pity , for he has a wonderful energy of vision , together with a fine gusto in phrase and an enviably muscular capacity for compressed statement : if he could only be severe with himself , and canalize his gifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitals , he could be one of the very best of contemporary poets , as he is already one of the most exciting . Mr. Kenneth Rexroth , who began his poetic career as an Objectivist , is now , with his new book , The Phoenix and the Tortoise , a welcome addition to the very small company of poets who are not afraid of long-form . The title poem is a long philosophical meditation , scientific in temper , pagan in flavor , historical in method , devoted , along with the shorter poems which follow , " to the discovery of a basis for the recreation of a system of values in sacramental marriage , " to quote from the author 's preface . One need not follow this , or agree with it , and one feels occasionally that some of the " largeness " in Mr. Rexroth 's poem is akin to that somewhat specious and stagey largeness which California so impartially visits upon trees , fruits and prophets alike ; but this is an impressive piece of work , very much alive intellectually , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is a poet to be reckoned // with . One 's chief complaint , as with Mr. Eberhart , is over the matter of form , of sound-effect : but whereas Mr. Eberhart surfeits us with too much violence and cacophony , Mr. Rexroth goes to the opposite extreme and gives us no sound at all : particularly in the title poem , this is the most entirely visual poetry that one could imagine ? visual , that is , in the sense that it is meant for the eye , on the printed page , and not at all for the gratification of the ear . It is limpid , it flows , it is always agreeably readable , but of mnemonic or sensuous or formal device it is usually disdainful , and for that reason , despite its intellectual vitality , it slips out of memory as fast as it is read . That Mr. Rexroth can do better about this when he wants to , is shown in such admirable short pieces , of a more descriptive sort , as " Now on this day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Eberhart can be said as pertinently of Mr. Ralph Gustafson , a young Canadian poet . But with a difference . Mr. Gustafson has Hopkins a little too much on his mind , he is determined to make things very hard for himself , and here we have tortured syntax , tortured order , tortured everything ? anything , almost , if only to avoid the merely straightforward and formal and simple . But Mr. Gustafson has an eye , and he loves words and the feel of language , and for all its strainings after effect , this is an unusual first book . Mr. Brinnin is a pegasus of another color entirely . The exception in this quartet of poets , he is an extremely competent , sometimes brilliant , exponent of form and tone-color , and what worries one about this new book of his is something else : it is the fact that it falls so much into a contemporary poetic " fashion . " Here is all that baggage of tired and disillusioned intellectualism with which we are so familiar ? the so carefully negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abstract , to deprecate , as if to feel too strongly , or too obviously , or not in terms of the self-contradictorily intricate , were somehow to be poetically indecent : The vision of an old cosmology And all who in its service die On rivieras of the intellect . And the negative angels , and all the rest of it . This is a poetry that wants to be cosmic , but also to sneer at the cosmic , and itself ; and what it adds up to is something very like decadence . But Mr. Brinnin often proves himself to be much better than the // fashion he follows , and one does not doubt that he will do so again . ELIOT , T. S. ( 1916 ) As anthologies go nowadays , Mr. Pound 's Catholic Anthology is an interesting one . Catholic , to be sure , seems somewhat of a misnomer for it ? the selection is perhaps catholic as far as the more radical modern poets are concerned ( though even here with signal omissions ? the Imagists , for instance ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more conservative . When Mr. Pound says Catholic , it appears that he means catholic as regards the comparatively small group of radicals with whom , for the moment , he is in sympathy ? with the addition of two conservatives who must be conciliated , Harold Monro and Harriet Monroe . Within these limits the selection is an interesting one . Dull things there are , of course ? each critic will find his own ? but for the present critic the Catholic Anthology seems worth while if only for the inclusion of The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock , and the Portrait of a Lady by T. S. Eliot . These are remarkable . They are individual to a degree . Mr. Eliot uses free rhyme very effectively , often musically ; and with the minimum of sacrifice to form conveys a maximum of atmosphere . Both poems are psychological character-studies , subtle to the verge of insoluble idiosyncrasy , introspective , self-gnawing . Those who are constitutionally afraid to analyze themselves , who do not think , who are not psychologically imaginative , will distrust and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crystallization of the efforts of the other contributors : one feels that here , in some such form as this , is the logical outcome of such unfinished , though often brilliant work , as that of Messrs . Masters , Bodenheim , Pound , and Rodker . For the rest of the book , the ten portraits taken from Spoon River are well selected : among them are some of the best . Mr. Pound 's selections from his own work are in his pleasantest aphoristic manner . For these , and for one or two other interesting things here and there , one accepts the remainder , and forgives the disordered and Whitmaniac egotism of Orrick Johns , the truisms of Allen U A REVIEWERS ABC ward , the seductive dullness of The Letter from Peking , and the hysterical movie scenarios of John Rodker . It is a pity , of course , that Mr. Pound 's quarrel with the Imagists has prevented the inclusion of any of the works of the more romantic of the radicals ? that the whole volume should be composed ( unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But perhaps Mr. Pound would object to these terms ? and perhaps the Imagists would too . It should be added that any anthology , which , like this , blows the horn of revolution in poetry , whether sound or unsound , is at the least certain to interest all poets , even the most conservative ; and will , perhaps , be of value to them . ELIOT , T. S. ( 1921 ) Mr. T. S. Eliot has , as we know , an eye for the odd , and yet that is not to do him complete justice : his eye is for what is significant in the odd ; and thus it is that we find him quoting , opposite the first page of his small , delightful book of criticism , The Sacred Wood , the cryptic line : " I also like to dine on becaficas . " Becaficas ? If one is not expert in sixteenth- and seventeenthcentury literature one learns from the dictionary that becaficas are " small birds " or " warblers " or " golden orioles " : what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , likes to dine on song-birds ; and he apprises us , with a gleaming and slightly sinister politeness , that he is about to do so . Would Mr. Eliot have us suppose that there is a trace of ferocity in this attitude ? Does he wish to appear as something of a monster , perhaps in contrast to the sentimentality and idolatry which too often masquerade as criticism of poetry ? One need not take the point too seriously . Yet it does afford , no doubt , a glimpse of motive . We are aware that Mr. Eliot intends , very deliberately intends , to be analytic and severe ? severe even to the point of destructiveness . Nor is one , in this regard , disappointed . His book is severe and analytic , and one can think of no two qualities in criticism which are at the moment more desirable . We should like to see every one of the thousand poets in this country with a copy of The Sacred Wood in his hands . It would perhaps restore to some that wholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , has ( 1921 ) T. S. Eliot 173 been weakened throughout our entire literary history by our proneness , as a young nation , to a maternal tenderness toward the local product . Mr. Eliot insists upon the value of tradition : it is a value which can not , just now , be too much insisted upon . He insists , again , on the elimination , as far as possible , of irrelevant emotional factors which may interfere with the best judgment of art : there is no country , which pretends to any interest in art , where that doctrine is needed as America needs it . But if to say these things is to praise Mr. Eliot 's book on general grounds , is to praise , in a general sense , his temper and his attitude , it is not our intention to praise his temper and attitude unreservedly . It is , perhaps , rather what Mr. Eliot intends , in temper and attitude , than what he achieves , that we like . It is a good thing , at this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even contemptuously , turns his back on the contemporary , and who endeavors to see afresh such poets as Massinger , Jonson , Blake , Dante , even Shakespeare . Mr. Eliot is not timid , nor is he without learning ; he speaks with confidence . One admires also , if one be in sympathy with that sort of thing , his tendency toward what might properly be termed the scientific method in criticism . But it is precisely here that one begins to qualify praise ; for although one may agree with Mr. Eliot that criticism might profitably be more scientific , one is by no means convinced that The Sacred Wood takes criticism very far in that direction , nor , indeed , that Mr. Eliot sees very far in that direction . It is clear enough that for scientific criticism a very definite point d'appui will be indispensable , even if the point d'appui be only that aesthetic values are relative . The critic should apprise us at the outset what his attitude will be , thus enabling us to discount it . He must , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly and easily the world of values in which he moves , must decide in advance what terms he will use . His terms should be expressly defined . If he intends , for example , to use the word " feeling " in the modern psychological sense , as distinct from " emotion , " he should say so in advance , lest his reader be confused ; or else substitute for it the less equivocal word " affect . " Mr. Eliot is not , in these matters , precise . He has been infected by modern psychology , and he uses the terms of it not infrequently ; but the basis from which he employs it shifts , and one is not sure that he is aware of the shift . Not with impunity can one mix the James-Lange set of terms with the terms of Freud : nor again the terms of de Gourmont ( who was an // amateur psychologist , and often a misleading one ) with those of Kostyleff . Poetry , says Mr. Eliot on one occasion , " is not the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On another occasion he says : " Massinger had not the personality to create great farce . " Again , he quotes with approval de Gourmont ( " Probleme du style " ) : " Le but de l'activite propre de l'homme est de nettoyer sa personnalite , de la laver de toutes les souillures qu'y deposa l'education . . . " Of Massinger again : " His personality hardly exists . " Now perhaps Mr. Eliot has something definite in mind when he speaks of personality , and perhaps he has some theory of the manner in which the personality of the poet relates to his work ; but he fails to make either thing clear . To what extent , when he thinks of personality , is he thinking of sensibility ? If sensibility be called a and experience b , then is personality ab ? And would this make de Gourmont 's advice meaningless ? And , in the upshot , do we not make it clear that " personality " is so vague a word as to be useless , even dangerous , if it is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for definition : love of definition is one of his most obvious characteristics . He performs an admirable service of this sort when , in his essay on " Poetic Drama , " he opens a coroner 's inquest on the word " rhetoric . " But his sense of the definite is intermittent ; it abandons him often at the most critical moment , and in consequence Mr. Eliot himself is forever abandoning us on the very doorstep of the illuminating . One has again and again the feeling that he is working , as it were , too close to the object . He is meticulous without being clear ; he passes quickly from one detail of analysis to another ; he is aggressively aware that he is " thinking , " his brow is knit ; but he appears to believe that mere fineness of analysis will constitute , in the sequence of his comments , a direction . What happens is that he achieves a kind of filigree without pattern . He does not always know in advance where he is going , and it often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought . That his talk continues to be of extraordinary interest does not avail : he is rapidly borne out of earshot . " On pense mal quand on Bait que l'on pense . " Mr. Eliot is so intent on being intelligent at every point , in every sentence , in every syllable , that many of his pages become mere incoherences of cleverness ; the evidence of thought is weighty , but the value of it is vague . If Mr. Eliot is only intermittently and at times sciolistically a psychologist in his effort toward a scientific method , one must ( 1921 ) T. S. Eliot 175 observe also that at the very basis of his attitude , where it is most explicit , in the essay called " The Perfect Critic , " he is least scientific . The ignorant reader ( I quote a passage in that essay ) " is unable to distinguish the poetry from an emotional state aroused in himself by the poetry , a state which may be merely an indulgence of his own emotion . . . . The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which all the accidents of personal emotion are removed ; thus we aim to see the object as it really is .... " Is this " pure contemplation " perhaps a chimera ? Is poetry an object , or an experience , a relation to an object , a relation between ourselves and a set of stimuli which the artist has " arranged " ? If the latter , which of the emotions aroused in us are the " accidental " ? The artist alone can tell us . I do not know , here , whether I agree or disagree with Mr. Eliot : I wish merely to point out that in what is obviously meant to be an important passage he falls far short of being clear . Supplement , moreover , the passage just quoted with this , from the essay on Hamlet ( a play which Mr. Eliot terms an artistic failure ) : " And probably more people have thought Hamlet a work of art because they found it interesting than have found it interesting because it is a work of art . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite logical in its context . It is here significant because it arouses a suspicion that Mr. Eliot is distrustful of the artist who uses " interesting " material , that he prefers the work of art which is a triumph over material of which the direct " emotional " interest is less obvious ( the plays of Massinger and Jonson , for example ) . But surely a work of art is no less a work of art for dealing with an emotional experience which interests or charms us than for dealing with one that repels or leaves us indifferent ? Let us again have recourse to algebra : let x represent a theme which " interests " us , y a theme which does not , z the utmost possible skill of arrangement of the theme . It will be clear that xz will delight us more than yz . And it is proper , is it not , that this should be so ? Mr. Eliot desires , of course , to make a distinction between the " emotional " appeal which a work of art may make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth making , but not if it leads the critic to condemn the former in order to exalt the latter , or if it leads him to attempt to isolate the latter , for " pure contemplation . " All of this is confusing because it is part of an attempt to make a beginning of scientific criticism on what is really a secondary plane . It is useless , or nearly useless , to attempt an // estimate of the " skill " of a work of art , because , as long as we do not know what the work of art is for , we can not hope to know precisely what will constitute skill . If criticism is to be a science , then we must begin with an attempt to understand what is the function of art , socially and psychologically . What is the function of art in the community ? In the life of the artist ? This must be the starting-point , and the inquiry will deal very largely , at the outset , precisely with the question of " theme " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " aesthetic " values will come later . Mr. Eliot 's perplexity and obscurity and lack of coherence result from the fact that he is on this secondary plane and does not know it . It would he extremely unjust , however , to leave it at that . His observations are acute , his temperateness is refreshing . It is a testimonial to the range and ingenuity of his mind that as one puts down his book one thinks of so many points about which one would like to quarrel with him , and quarrel , moreover , respectfully . Is Hamlet a failure as a work of art ? Does Mr. Eliot find , in his essay on that play , the " objective correlative " of his conviction ? Was a suitable mythological or philosophical framework , provided by tradition , lacking for Blake ? With such questions as these Mr. Eliot invites us to a meditation prolonged and delicious . . . . Nor would one forget to abuse him for his clever but insufficient theory of the prose style of Mr. Arthur Symons . ELIOT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most individual of contemporary poets , and at the same time , anomalously , one of the most " traditional . " By individual I mean that he can be , and often is ( distressingly , to some ) aware in his own way ; as when he observes of a woman ( in " Rhapsody on a Windy Night " ) that the door " opens on her like a grin " and that the corner of her eye " Twists like a crooked pin . " Everywhere , in the very small body of his work , is similar evidence of a delicate sensibility , somewhat shrinking , somewhat injured , and always sharply itself . But also , with this capacity or necessity for being aware in his own way , Mr. Eliot has a haunting , a tyrannous awareness that there have been many other awarenesses before ; and that the ( 1923 ) T. S. Eliot 177 extent of his own awareness , and perhaps even the nature of it , is a consequence of these . He is , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness had not become acute in Pru frock or the Portrait of a Lady , it was nevertheless probably there : and the roots were quite conspicuously French , and dated , say , 1870-1900 . A little later , as his sense of the past had become more pressing , it seemed that he was positively redirecting his roots ? urging them to draw a morbid dramatic sharpness from Webster and Donne , a faded dry gilt of cynicism and formality from the Restoration . This search of the tomb produced " Sweeney " and " Whispers of Immortality . " And finally , in The Waste Land , Mr. Eliot 's sense of the literary past has become so overmastering as almost to constitute the motive of the work . It is as if , in conjunction with the Mr. Pound of the Cantos , he wanted to make a " literature of literature " ? a poetry actuated not more by life itself than by poetry ; as if he had concluded that the characteristic awareness of a poet of the twentieth century must inevitably , or ideally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to speak only , or best , in terms of the literary past , the terms which had molded its tongue . This involves a kind of idolatry of literature with which it is a little difficult to sympathize . In positing , as it seems to , that there is nothing left for literature to do but become a kind of parasitic growth on literature , a sort of mistletoe , it involves , I think , a definite astigmatism ? a distortion . But the theory is interesting if only because it has colored an important and brilliant piece of work . The Waste Land is unquestionably important , unquestionably brilliant . It is important partly because its 433 lines summarize Mr. Eliot , for the moment , and demonstrate that he is an even better poet than most had thought ; and partly because it embodies the theory just touched upon , the theory of the " allusive " method in poetry . The Waste Land is , indeed , a poem of allusion all compact . It purports to be symbolical ; most of its symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has thought it necessary to supply , in notes , a list of the many quotations , references , and translations with which it bristles . He observes candidly that the poem presents " difficulties , " and requires " elucidation . " This serves to raise at once , the question whether these difficulties , in which perhaps Mr. Eliot takes a little pride , are so much the result of complexity , a fine elaborateness , as of confusion . The poem has been compared , by one reviewer , to a " full-rigged ship built in a bottle , " the suggestion // being that it is a perfect piece of construction . But is it a perfect piece of construction ? Is the complex material mastered , and made coherent ? Or , if the poem is not successful in that way , in what way is it successful ? Has it the formal and intellectual complex unity of a microscopic Divine Comedy ; or is its unity ? supposing it to have one ? of another sort ? If we leave aside for the moment all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of understanding , with the aid of the notes , the symbolism ; of making out what it is that is symbolized , and how these symbolized feelings are brought into relation with each other and with the other matters in the poem ; I think we must , with reservations , and with no invidiousness , conclude that the poem is not , in any formal sense , coherent . We can not feel that all the symbolisms belong quite inevitably where they have been put ; that the order of the parts is an inevitable order ; that there is anything more than a rudimentary progress from one theme to another ; nor that the relation between the more symbolic parts and the less is always as definite as it should be . What we feel is that Mr. Eliot has not wholly annealed the allusive matter , has left it unabsorbed , lodged in gleaming fragments amid material alien to it . Again , there is a distinct weakness consequent on the use of allusions which may have both intellectual and emotional value for Mr. Eliot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " Waste Land " of the Grail Legend might be a good symbol , if it were something with which we were sufficiently familiar . But it can never , even when explained , be a good symbol , simply because it has no immediate associations for us . It might , of course , be a good theme . In that case it would be given us . But Mr. Eliot uses it for purposes of overtone ; he refers to it ; and as overtone it quite clearly fails . He gives us , superbly , a waste land ? not the Waste Land . Why , then , refer to the latter at all ? if he is not , in the poem , really going to use it ? Hyacinth fails in the same way . So does the Fisher King . So does the Hanged Man , which Mr. Eliot tells us he associates with Frazer 's Hanged God ? we take his word for it . But if the precise association is worth anything , it is worth putting into the poem ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , again , Datta , Dayadhvam , Damyata ? Or Shantih ? Do they not say a good deal less for us than " Give : sympathize : control " or " Peace " ? Of course ; but Mr. Eliot replies that he wants them not merely to mean those particular things , but also to mean them in a particular way ? that is , to be remembered in connection with a Upanishad . Unfortunately , we have ( 1923 ) T. S. Eliot 179 none of us this memory , nor can he give it to us ; and in the upshot he gives us only a series of agreeable sounds which might as well have been nonsense . What we get at , and I think it is important , is that in none of these particular cases does the reference , the allusion , justify itself intrinsically , make itself felt . When we are aware of these references at all ( sometimes they are unidentifiable ) we are aware of them simply as something unintelligible but suggestive . When they have been explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , ( for instance , a vegetation ceremony , ) as something useless for our enjoyment or understanding of the poem , something distinctly " dragged in , " and only , perhaps , of interest as having suggested a pleasantly ambiguous line . For unless an allusion is made to live identifiably , to flower where transplanted , it is otiose . We admit the beauty of the implicational or allusive method ; but the key to an implication should be in the implication itself , not outside of it . We admit the value of esoteric pattern : but the pattern should disclose its secret , should not be dependent on a cypher . Mr. Eliot assumes for his allusions , and for the fact that they actually allude to something , an importance which the allusions themselves do not , as expressed , aesthetically command , nor , as explained , logically command ; which is pretentious . He is a little pretentious , too , in his " plan " ? qui pourtant n'existe pas . If it is a plan , then its principle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wilderness , a broken finger-post . I enumerate these objections not , I must , emphasize , in derogation of the poem , but to dispel , if possible , an illusion as to its nature . It is perhaps important to note that Mr. Eliot , with his comment on the " plan , " and several critics , with their admiration of the poem 's woven complexity , minister to the idea that The Waste Land is , precisely , a kind of epic in a walnut shell : elaborate , ordered , unfolded with a logic at every joint discernible ; but it is also important to note that this idea is false . With or without the notes the poem belongs rather to that symbolical order in which one may justly say that the " meaning " is not explicitly , or exactly , worked out . Mr. Eliot 's net is wide , its meshes are small ; and he catches a good deal more ? thank heaven ? than he pretends to . If space permitted one could pick out many lines and passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any " logical " sense , carry forward the theme , passages which unjustifiably , but happily , " expand " beyond its purpose . Thus the poem has . an emotional value far clearer and richer than its arbitrary and 18o A REVIEWERS ABC rather unworkable logical value . One might assume that it originally consisted of a number of separate poems which have been telescoped ? given a kind of forced unity . The Waste Land conception offered itself as a generous net which would , if not unify , at any rate contain these varied elements . We are aware of a superficial " binding " ? we observe the anticipation and repetition of themes , motifs ; " Fear death by water " anticipates the episode of Phlebas , the cry of the nightingale is repeated ; but these are pretty flimsy links , and do not genuinely bind because they do not reappear naturally , but arbitrarily . This suggests , indeed , that Mr. Eliot is perhaps attempting a kind of program music in words , endeavoring to rule out " emotional accidents " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations which are correct . He himself hints at the musical analogy when he observes that " In the first part of Part V three themes are employed . " I think , therefore , that the poem must be taken ? most invitingly offers itself ? as a brilliant and kaleidoscopic confusion ; as a series of sharp , discrete , slightly related perceptions and feelings , dramatically and lyrically presented , and violently juxtaposed , ( for effect of dissonance ) so as to give us an impression of an intensely modern , intensely literary consciousness which perceives itself to be not a unit but a chance correlation or conglomerate of mutually discolorative fragments . We are invited into a mind , a world , which is a " broken bundle of mirrors " ; a " heap of broken images . " Is n't it that Mr. Eliot , finding it " impossible to say just what he means " ? to recapitulate , to enumerate all the events and discoveries and memories that make a consciousness ? has emulated the " magic lantern " that throws " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we perceive the poem in this light , as a series of brilliant , brief , unrelated or dimly related pictures by which a consciousness empties itself of its characteristic contents , then we also perceive that , anomalously , though the dropping out of any one picture would not in the least affect the logic or " meaning " of the whole , it would seriously detract from the value of the portrait . The " plan " of the poem would not greatly suffer , one makes bold to assert , by the elimination of " April is the cruelest month , " or Phlebas , or the Thames daughters , or Sosostris or " You gave me hyacinths " or " A woman drew her long black hair out tight " ; nor would it matter if it did . These things are not important parts of an important or careful intellectual pattern ; but they are important parts of an important emotional // ensemble . The relations between Tiresias ( who is said to unify the poem , in a sense , as spectator ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other fragment , is a dim and tonal one , not exact . It will not bear analysis , it is not always operating , nor can one with assurance , at any given point , say how much it is operating . In this sense The Waste Land is a series of separate poems or passages , not perhaps all written at one time or with one aim , to which a spurious but happy sequence has been given . This spurious sequence has a value ? it creates the necessary superficial formal unity ; but it need not be stressed , as the Notes stress it . Could one not wholly rely for one 's unity ? as Mr. Eliot has largely relied ? simply on the dim unity of " personality " which would underlie the retailed contents of a single consciousness ? Unless one is going to carry unification very far , weave and interweave very closely , it would perhaps be as well not to unify at all ; to dispense , for example , with arbitrary repetitions . We reach thus the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by virtue of its incoherence , not of its plan ; by virtue of its ambiguities , not of its explanations . Its incoherence is a virtue because its donnee is incoherence . Its rich , vivid , crowded use of implication is a virtue , as implication is always a virtue ? it shimmers , it suggests , it gives the desired strangeness . But when , as often , Mr. Eliot uses an implication beautifully ? conveys by means of a picture-symbol or actionsymbol a feeling ? we do not require to be told that he had in mind a passage in the Encyclopedia , or the color of his nursery wall ; the information is disquieting , has a sour air of pedantry . We " accept " the poem as we would accept a powerful , melancholy tone-poem . We do not want to be told what occurs ; nor is it more than mildly amusing to know what passages are , in the Straussian manner , echoes or parodies . We can not believe that every syllable has an algebraic inevitability , nor would we wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian , Latin , and Hindu phrases ? they are irritating . But when our reservations have all been made , we accept The Waste Land as one of the most moving and original poems of our time . It captures us . And we sigh , with a dubious eye on the " notes " and " plan , " our bewilderment that after so fine a performance Mr. Eliot should have thought it an occasion for calling " Tullia 's ape a marmosyte . " Tullia 's ape is good enough . ELIOT , T. S. ( 1927 ) It has been often enough , perhaps too often said , of late , that the almost fatal difficulty which confronts the poet nowadays is the difficulty of finding a theme which might be worth his power . If he be potentially a " major " poet , this difficulty is thought to be particularly formidable , if not actually crippling ; but for even the " minor " poet ( to use minor in no pejorative sense ) it is considered serious . Mr. T. S. Eliot , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed something to this theory . In his admirable note on Blake , in The Sacred Wood , he suggests that Blake was potentially a major poet who was robbed of his birthright by the mere accident of there not being , at the moment , a prepared or traditional cosmology or mythology of sufficient wealth to engage , or disengage , his great imaginative power . He was compelled , in the absence of such a frame , to invent a frame for himself ; and in this was , perhaps inevitably , doomed to failure . Had he been horn to a belief as rich and profound as that which Dante inherited , might he not have been as great a poet ? .. . This is an ingenious idea ; but it is possible to take it too seriously . It is obvious enough that some sort of tradition is a very great help to a poet ? it floats him and sustains him , it carries him more swiftly and easily than he could carry himself , and it indicates a direction for him . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , is that the great poet may be , precisely , one who has a capacity to find , at any given moment , a theme sufficient for the proper exercise of his strength . There were contemporaries of Dante who were excellent poets , but for whom the cosmology which enchanted Dante was not evocative . If Blake scanned his horizon in vain for " huge cloudy symbols , " Goethe , scanning the same horizon , was not so unsuccessful . It is true enough that , with the decay of religion as a force in human life , poetry must be robbed of that particular kind of conviction , as has been noted by Mr. I. A. Richards ; but to assume from this that the poetry of the future must inevitably be a poetry of skepticism or negation is perhaps to oversimplify the issue . Poetry has always shown itself able to keep step easily and naturally with the utmost that man can do in extending his knowledge , no matter how destructive of existing beliefs that knowledge may be . Each accretion of knowledge becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1927 ) T. S. Eliot 183 attitude to the world , takes on affective values or overtones , and is then ready for use in poetry . The universe does not become each year simpler or less disturbing : nor is there any reason to suppose that it ever will . The individual who is born into it will continue to be surprised and delighted by it , or surprised and injured ; and in direct ratio with this surprise and delight or surprise and injury , he will continue to be a poet . The wail of contemporary criticism , therefore , to the effect that poetry can find nothing to cling to , leaves one a little skeptical : though it is easy enough to sympathize with the individual poets who , suffering from that delusion , have for the moment lost themselves in self-distrust . Mr. Pound and Mr. Eliot are perhaps very typical victims of this kind . But whereas Mr. Pound has evaded the issue , seeking asylum in a sense of the past ( rather half-heartedly held ) Mr. Eliot has made a poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset a poetry of self-consciousness ; of instinct at war with doubt , and sensibility at odds with reason ; an air of precocious cynicism has hung over it ; and his development as a poet has not been so much a widening of his field ? though at first sight The Waste Land might suggest this ? as a deepening of his awareness of it . Prufrock , who antedated by a decade the later poem , could not give himself to his emotions or his instincts because he could not bring himself , sub specie aeternitatis , quite to believe in them : he was inhibited , and preferred to remain a despairing spectator : but at the same time he wished that he might have been a simpler organism , " a pair of ragged claws . " The theme of Gerontion , a good many years later , is the same : it is again the paralyzing effect of consciousness , the " after such knowledge , what forgiveness ? " And The Waste Land is again a recapitulation , reaching once more the same point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision or action , with its " awful daring of a moment 's surrender , which an age of prudence can never retract . " The reissue of Poems is not the occasion for a detailed review of Mr. Eliot 's early work , however ; for our present purpose it is sufficient to note that Mr. Eliot has conspicuously shared the contemporary feeling that there are no " large " themes for the poet , and that he has had the courage and the perspicacity to take as his theme precisely this themelessness . Why not ? he says in effect ? make a bitter sort of joke of one 's nihilism and impotence ? And in making his bitter joke , he has written some of the most searchingly unhappy and vivid // and individual of contemporary poetry . One feels that his future is secure , by virtue of his honesty quite as much as by virtue of his genius . ELIOT , T. S. ( 1929 ) If it is impossible to read Mr. T. S. Eliot 's criticism without respect , it is also becoming increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood , and again in Homage to John Dryden , Mr. Eliot provided his immediate generation with a group of literary essays that were an admirable corrective for many of the intellectual and aesthetic disorders of the time . They were compact , precise , astringent ; they brought the past to bear on the present , the present into a visible relation with the past ; in short , they helped materially to restore , for a literary generation which had lost its bearings , a sense of tradition as a living and fruitful thing . If one had any complaint to make , with regard to these essays , it was not of their main tendency , which was wholesome ; nor had one any fault to find with Mr. Eliot 's intelligence and aesthetic tact , which were acute ; it was rather with regard to the plane on which Mr. Eliot chose to conduct his analysis ? and the tone which he adopted ? that one might have caviled . In the matter of plane , one had to note that Mr. Eliot tended to be somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often analysis of the document itself than of the psychological dynamics of which the document was the sign ; he seemed to regard literary forms as absolute and autonomous ; and correspondingly , he seemed to minimize the merely functional , or social and psychological , elements in the creation of literature . These restrictions made for simplicity and weight ; but they also gave one an uncomfortable feeling that a great deal was being left out . In his very preoccupation with what was past and fixed , Mr. Eliot was perhaps already beginning to define himself , and his limitations , more candidly than he was quite aware . It was as if the immediate , the fluidly immediate , the here and now ? whether it were to be seen in terms of personality and the relation of personality to the work of art , or in terms of the relation of the work of art to its social " moment " ? were positively frightening to him . Again and again he took elaborate ( 1929 ) T. S. Eliot 185 pains to evade or minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain that the work of art is an escape from personality ; a very revelatory view . It may here be pertinently questioned whether it is not precisely in this curious doctrine that Mr. Eliot is seeking an " escape from personality . " From the psychological chaos of the " I " and the " now , " let us seek refuge in a world of canons , forms , and rituals . But if one felt , now and then , a shiver from this quarter in The Sacred Wood , one is exposed to a merciless blast of it in Mr. Eliot 's new book , For Lancelot Andrewes . In this , Mr. Eliot seems to be definitely and defeatedly in retreat from the present and all that it implies . A thin and vinegarish hostility toward the modern world is breathed from these pages . Seeking certainties , or at least a hope of certainties , Mr. Eliot sounds a quavering recall , and attempts to lead us back to classicism in literature , to royalism in politics , and to the Anglo-Catholic church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ancillary of religion , a kind of parasite , unable to exist fruitfully in its own right . Reason is bankrupt . Of the human race , the less said the better . Of Machiavelli , he remarks in this new book : " He was no fanatic ; he merely told the truth about humanity . The world of human motives which he depicts is true ? that is to say , it is humanity without the addition of superhuman Grace . It is therefore tolerable only to persons who have also a definite religious belief ; to the effort of the last three centuries to supply religious belief by belief in Humanity the creed of Machiavelli is insupportable . . . . What Machiavelli did not see about human nature is the myth of human goodness which for liberal thought replaces the belief in Divine Grace . " It is hard to describe this as anything but a complete abdication of intelligence . And pari passu with this abdication goes a striking change in Mr. Eliot 's whole outlook and style . A note of withered dogmatism sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sympathies has narrowed and hardened ; in his essays on Andrewes and Bramhall , he is even led , by his propagandist zeal , to write dully of dull subjects . Throughout the entire book ? unless we except some excellent pages on Middleton and Baudelaire ? we feel the presence of a spirit which is inimical to everything new or bold or generous . Cautiously , jejunely , with an air of puritan acerbity , it seeks a refuge from humanity in Grace , from personality in dogma , and from the present in the past . Turning its back on the living word , it retreats into a monastic chill ; and denies the miracle and abun186 A REVIEWER 'S ABC dance of life . But can the miracle and abundance be denied in this fashion ? Not , one suspects , so simply or so summarily . The moment is still with us , it is a world to be explored , and there are still intrepid explorers . Mr. Eliot might have been one of these ? as indeed in his verse at times he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he might be yet . It is to be hoped that he will not continue to prefer a narrower and safer path . ELIOT , T. S. ( 1934 ) Mr. Eliot 's new essays , which were delivered last year at Harvard from the Charles Eliot Norton chair , have all the virtues of the first-rate lecture : they move easily , they are lucid and orderly , they are informative without being too much weighted with pedantry , and they do not forget to be entertaining . We are given a survey , excellently planned and simplified ( and , on the whole , with very judicious omissions ) of the linked progress , or evolution , side by side , of English poetry and criticism , from Elizabethan times to the present day . Mr. Eliot 's method is that of the inquirer ? he makes few assumptions , he has little recourse to dogma . He asks questions , very pertinently and gently ; and answers them , generally , with a careful tentativeness . If at times he appears a little superficial , or sketchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried , it is only fair to assume that at least a part of this arises from the normal difficulty of the lecturer . A style too packed or dense would have defeated his purpose . What emerges from the book ? of general " view , " or conclusion ? does so largely by implication : if Mr. Eliot lays down any emphatic dogma at all , it is simply that poetry can , and does , vary in its function at different times and in different places ; and that along with it , pari passu , criticism alters its pace and direction . That criticism has gradually sharpened its technical analysis , in objectivity , in its ability and willingness to keep fresh a sense of the past , and in psychological and social awareness , Mr. Eliot seems to admit . This evolution he traces , very neatly and illuminatingly , all the way from Sidney to Mr. I. A. Richards . But that with this " progress " in the perceptiveness of criticism has developed any clearer or more precise idea of what ( 1934 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for , he does not appear altogether convinced . What his own views may be , of the nature and function of poetry , or of the nature and function of criticism , emerges , again , rather by implication or negation than by statement ; and these , of course , are of particular interest , as coming from one of the most important poets of our time . Implied , to begin with , in Mr. Eliot 's whole attitude to his subject ( the variability of poetry 's social use or function ) is a skepticism as to the existence of any universal , or essence , or " permanent , " in poetry ? or , at any rate , a doubt as to what it is . " The extreme of theorizing about the nature of poetry , " he says , " the essence of poetry if there is any , belongs to the study of aesthetics . " Perhaps he might better have said , to psychology and to sociology ? for aesthetics , like poetry , changes its tone and temper with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or universal in poetry , it is its social function ; and about this , modern psychologists have already had a good deal to say , and will have more . Sooner or later they will tell us what , at all times and in all places , poetry does . It is my own opinion that Mr. Richards , in his Principles of Literary Criticism especially , but in his other books as well , is making a very important step in this direction . From Mr. Eliot 's view of poetry as a thing of variable and indeterminate function to his suggestion that it is not so much a " communication " as " itself a thing to be communicated " ( a separate entity ) is a natural step . This is again to cut away the psychological roots . It seems to me quite impossible to rule out communication . If language is communication , poetry is simply communication ( or language ) working at its highest pitch . Poetry can not communicate itself alone , any more than language can communicate itself alone ? Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem does to the poet , the reading of it does to the reader ; and whether we call it " organization , " with Mr. Richards , or revelation , with the mystics , it is au fond a sharing , a making common , a communication . Criticism , here , will simply say how successful the communication is , and why , and of what ; it will regard the poem not as an absolute but as a dynamic : and will trace its references backward to the poet and forward to the reader . A poem as a completely separate entity would be a poem completely without reference , and therefore without meaning : an impossibility . This is not to say that criticism could not usefully discriminate between the thing communicated ( the world ) and the communication ( the word ) . But analysis , pushed far enough , would discover them // ( one suspects ) to be the same thing . In this regard , Mr. Eliot 's remark that " meaning " may be simply the chief method of keeping the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " seems to be the result of confused thinking . Remove the logical statement from a poem , an important part of the " meaning " would still remain ? the affective . And it is precisely in this way that poetry makes the highest use of language , as it perhaps also represents the highest degree of consciousness of which man is capable : the most complete . It combines the logical or factual with the affective . As will seem natural enough from the foregoing , Mr. Eliot shies at the notion of poetry as " revelation , " and equally at Mr. Richards ' suggestion that in poetry we can find a " substitute " for religion : he must have them separate . Is this our old friend the Ivory Tower ? Perhaps Mr. Eliot 's private religious predicament is answerable for it ? in any case , he is at some pains , and with considerable sophistical disingenuousness , to ridicule Mr. Richards ' idea that mankind , having shed religious dogma and arbitrary faith , will find through poetry a sufficient communication with the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in entire agreement with Mr. Richards about this ? it seems to me not impossible that religion was simply a temporary form of poetry . And I can not agree with Mr. Eliot that poetry can not be philosophic , or can only borrow its thinking : poetry can think deeply and still be poetry ; it has thought deeply in the past , and is learning to think again . Poetic " thinking " is a real thinking . What about Zarathustra ? ELIOT , T. S. ( 1934 ) To read these two new books of Mr. Eliot 's together is to be made more than ever uncomfortable about his present predicament , his present position and direction . It is unfair to examine a lecture as closely as one would an essay in criticism , and After Strange Gods consists , of course , of three lectures delivered at the University of Virginia . It is equally unfair to judge the printed text of a pageant , a pageant written in cooperation with others and for performance on a special occasion , as one would judge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , one must begin by discounting ( 1934 ) T. S. Eliot 189 both books as not quite " pure " Eliot . Nevertheless , there they are , they must be fitted into the Eliot tradition , they fall into line , and Mr. Eliot himself invites the comparison by publishing them ; and it must be confessed that they leave one with a feeling of dissatisfaction and uncertainty . The lectures consist chiefly of an extension and elaboration of the now-famous essay in The Sacred Wood ? " Tradition and the Individual Talent . " It is difficult to see that they add much of importance , whether in refinement of perception , or in division or addition ; if anything , they are a dilution of the earlier work , they seem a little thin . Of course , as we all know , Mr. Eliot has turned to religion in the interval of thirteen years between The Sacred Wood and After Strange Gods , and it is not without a melancholy interest to consider the later book in this special light . From " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , a natural semantic and mantic step to take ; Mr. Eliot takes it , and is at no pains to conceal it . Everywhere here is the implication that not only is it of vital importance for the artist ( as individual ) to remain in a sort of conscious connection with the tradition from which he springs , but also that if this contact can be further or more deeply extended to include a connection with the Church he will be safer still . Leaving aside , as one must , the whole question of religious belief , or of orthodox religion , nevertheless one is at once aware that the change in Mr. Eliot 's critical attitude is decidedly in the direction of limitation . Already , in " Tradition and the Individual Talent , " his emphasis was not so much on the freedom offered the artist by tradition as on the restrictions ; the use of tradition was rather to hold one back than to release one for a forward step of exploration ; in short , the position was a cautious one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If little room was then left for the individual 's " free play , " there is now very much less . As a mother of the arts , Mr. Eliot 's " tradition " would be a very anxious and possessive one indeed ; and ( one is afraid ) very crippling . Individualism must go by the board ? if such a program should become universal ? and the creative renewal of the arts fall to so low a level as to lead inevitably to stagnation . With the death of the individual would come the death of tradition ; and art would be simply a history . A curious state of things , a curious attitude in one who has himself been one of the most pronouncedly and creatively " individual " of contemporary writers , and himself therefore a // pretty violent creator of tradition ; and one immediately begins to wonder what effect his doctrines will have on his own poetry . The Rock alone can not give us much of an answer , for as observed above , it is not a " pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , with the handful of poems which Mr. Eliot has given us in the twelve years since he published The Waste Land , it is enough to make one uneasy . Without in any way detracting from the extraordinary beauty of Ash Wednesday or Marina , or from the occasional brilliance of other of the later poems , one can not fail to notice a contraction both of interest and power in the recent work . Ash Wednesday , let it be said at once , is perhaps the most beautiful of all Mr. Eliot 's poems : it seems not unlikely that its " value " will outlast that of The Waste Land . It is purer and less violent ; it depends less on shock , though elements of shock are still there , enough of them to give energy ; in Mr. Eliot 's own sense , it is more absolutely a poem , has a new being and constitutes a new experience , and is so much more without " reference , " or conscious reference , and so much more heavily weighted with unconscious reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly meaninglessness which we call pure poetry . But , though we can like it better than The Waste Land , or feel it to be finer , we also feel it to mark the beginning of a diminution of vigor and variousness : the circle has narrowed , and it has gone on narrowing . We can not , of course , argue that this change is due to the change in Mr. Eliot 's views , any more than we can argue that some deeper diminution of energy led to the change of view ; all we can do is observe that the two things have gone together . In The Rock , the choruses are not the very best Eliot , though they are skillful and beautiful ; they are admirably calculated for declamation ; they have an excellent hardness and plainness ; but at times one feels the cunning of the rhetoric and the rhythm to be almost too glib and easy , and as if usurping the place of what would formerly have been a richer and more natural inventiveness . Mr. Eliot remarks , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most difficult of all things . Orthodox religious poetry , yes : for that is merely to state , or to state by referring , or to argue : which is propaganda , or something very like it , as long as it remains within that given frame of traditional or taught conviction , as it must . It is this that makes // one uneasy about Mr. Eliot 's future : this and his converse belief that poetry , or even the poetic genius , can not be a substitute for religion . To many of us it must appear that " orthodox religion , " on the one hand , and " tradition , " on the other , are simply nothing but a temporary conservatism , or freezing in formula , of the initial poetic impulse . Beyond a certain point , or for more than a given time , it can not be formalized : along comes a poet who reaches through it to the thing itself . Perhaps Mr. Eliot 's experiment with dramatic form in The Rock , which must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers , will release him once more in ways which neither he nor ourselves can foresee . ELIOT , T. S. ( 1935 ) We ought , of course , to have gone to Ascot to see the gray top hats and lovely dresses ( not to mention the umbrellas ) and perhaps a horse or two ; instead we joined a very different pilgrimage , and one with an even statelier history than Queen Anne 's Royal Ascot . In short , we went to Canterbury . It was the week of Canterbury 's annual Festival of Music and Drama , an affair organized by the Friends of Canterbury Cathedral , its admirable object being to raise funds for the upkeep and repair of the church . The program of entertainment was unusu-ally good this year ? first-class concerts in the Cloisters by the B.B.C. Orchestra , and also in the Cathedral itself ( the only regrettable feature of this being that for the moment one was unable to see the newly restored tomb of the Black Prince , now bright gold ) , with music by Bach , Ravel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . No wonder the little town was crowded , swarms of uniformed schoolgirls being especially conspicuous , but the strangest thing of all was the fact that this year the chief attraction was actually the work of an American . To be exact , an ex-American . T. S. Eliot had been invited by the Friends of the Cathedral to write a play for the occasion ? no doubt because of his production of The Rock last year at Sadler 's Wells , in aid of the City churches ? and he complied , giving them Murder in the Cathedral . Thus , without any preliminary fuss or fanfare , without advertisements in the news192 A REVIEWER 'S ABC papers , or any advance announcements except through Church channels , a poetic play was staged in the Chapter House which may well mark a turning point in English drama . Making every allowance for the extreme impressiveness of the surroundings ? the hall of the Chapter House is , of course , magnificent ? and for the extraordinary associational aid in the fact that a play about Thomas a Becket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the martyrdom itself had been enacted ? a combination of circumstances which must remain unique ? nevertheless , one had n't listened five minutes before one felt that one was witnessing a play which had the quality of greatness . If one had become uneasy about the effect of Eliot 's churchward leanings on his poetry , one forgot that at once . Performed in a barn , and before an audience of skeptics , Murder in the Cathedral would still be a profound and beautiful thing . It transcends the particular beliefs on which it has been built ? or , rather , it creates its own beliefs out of its own sheer livingness ? exactly as Everyman does , or Oedipus Rex , and , incidentally , with striking technical resemblances to both . The use of the chorus of ten women , and the choruses themselves , were superb . One 's feeling was that here at last was the English language literally being used , itself becoming the stuff of drama , turning alive with its own natural poetry . And Eliot 's formalization was n't at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect of poetic drama ? no trace of sham antique or artiness about it ; nothing , in the " dead " sense , " poetic . " No , the thing was directly and terribly real , the poetry of the choruses was as simple and immediate in its meaning as our own daily lives , and the transition into satirical modern prose at the end , when the four knights turned and addressed the audience , came without shock . It is a triumph of poetic genius that out of such actionless material ? the mere conflict of a mind with itself ? a play so deeply moving , and so exciting , should have been written ; and so rich , moreover , in the various language of humanity . That is perhaps the greatest surprise about it ? in the play Eliot has become human , and tender , with a tenderness and a humanity which have nowhere else in our time found such beauty of form . The production by Martin Browne was perfect . The stage was of the simplest , the actors approaching it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience ; the chorus , when not speaking , sitting at the right and left in the niches between little columns , as if merely a part of the design . Robert Speaight , as ( 1936 ) T. S. Eliot 193 Becket , was superb . The other parts were taken by amateurs , the Cathedral Players , who gave a performance that professionals might envy . And the speaking of the choruses was so beautiful that one actually resented at moments the singing which served as a counterpoint for it , from the gallery at the other end of the hall ; for once , the spoken word was all one wanted . Altogether , an event ; and we shall be surprised if later this lovely thing is n't given a run in the West End of London , or even put on by the Theatre Guild in New York . ELIOT , T. S. ( 1936 ) Mr. Eliot is nothing if not thrifty . Of the ten essays in his new book , five appeared formerly in For Lancelot Andrewes ? among them , the admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book have not , for whatever reasons , been retained : those on Middleton , Crashaw , and Machiavelli . One regrets their omission , if only because , in the religious aridity to which Mr. Eliot now so often leads us , they formed a refreshing oasis of color . And in the present volume their places have been taken by essays which on the whole are Mr. Eliot at his heaviest ? " Religion and Literature , " " Catholicism and International Order , " " Modern Education and the Classics , " " The Pensees of Pascal , " and a brief note on Tennyson . Heaviest and , let us add frankly , dreariest : for Mr. Eliot is very much in earnest , he is very solemn and , alas , he is often very dull . The prose , in the religio-social essays , is tired and flaccid , the argument tedious and thin ; and ultimately one finds oneself reflecting that one 's interest is not at all in the ideas presented , which are nowhere very surprising , nor in the reasoning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent , but in the fact that these ideas and these reasons are Mr. Eliot 's . The spectacle , in short , is that of one of the finest and most perceptive minds of the age , and one of the wittiest , occupied in a retrogression , or regression , which is as astonishing as it is melancholy . The main features of Mr. Eliot 's panacea for a barbarous and backsliding age are of course familiar enough ? he would have us be good Christians , by which he means good Anglo-Catholics , and he would have us read the classics . For the understanding of the latter , and of literature in general , and for the proper // judgment of values , both in letters and in life , he suggests that we must bring the touchstone of Christian ethics : a singular denouement for the critic who , in " Tradition and the Individual Talent , " sailed so close to the Siren shores of Abstract Art . With Mr. Eliot 's feeling that the age is too much secularized , or too materialistic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is impossible not to agree . What one can not agree with is his notion that religion can exist only in a church , or in one kind of church . Any more than one can agree with him in his strange idea that regionalism , both national and international , is the only remaining political hope of mankind , or that the revival of monastic teaching offers the only hope for the study of Latin and Greek " in their proper place and for the right reasons . " Shades of Erasmus ! But this is Mr. Eliot at his most priggish , and it is pleasanter to record one 's gratitude for the notes on Pascal , which are very good indeed , and the charitable act of restoration which he performs in so generously praising Tennyson . Too generously , perhaps . When he says that the poems of Thomas Hardy ? among which one must remember The Dynasts ? are " small work in comparison with In Memoriam ' ? it is greater than they and comprehends them , " one feels that the gambit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot does n't admire Tennyson for the wrong reasons ? and in the wrong places . Just the same , to reread Tennyson is a good idea . ELIOT , T. S. ( 1949 ) Forty years ago Cambridge , Massachusetts , or that part of it adjacent to Harvard College , was not at all the ugly manufacturing city it has become : it was still in many senses a village . Lilacs and white picket fences under elms , horse-drawn watering-carts to lay the dust in the blindingly dusty streets of summer , board-walks put down on the pavements every winter and taken up again every spring , sleighs and pungs in the snow , and the dreadful college bell reverberant over all . Were we gayer as undergraduates than those of today ? At all events we were gay , and my earliest single recollection of our sixty-year-old hero is of a singularly attractive , tall , and rather dapper young man , with a somewhat Lamian smile , who reeled out of the ( 1949 ) T. S. Eliot 195 door of the Lampoon on a spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms about me ? from the open windows above came the unmistakable uproar of a punch in progress . " And that , " observed my astonished companion , " if Tom remembers it tomorrow , will cause him to suffer agonies of shyness . " And no d bt it did : for he was shy . Not that this by any means kept m out of social circulation . For if we met to begin with as ellow editors of the Harvard Advocate ( diaboli Advocati ) , whether at board meetings on the top floor of the Union , or at initiations , or punches , or even at tea ( with rum in it ) , we also met at Buckingham and Brattle Hall dances and at the Signet , a club with vaguely literary pretensions and an excellent small library , which was said to have been founded by a scion of the Bonaparte family . He was early explicit , too , about the necessity , if one was shy , of disciplining oneself , lest one miss certain varieties of experience which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the parties , were a part of this discipline , as later on ? after a year at the Sorbonne , at the end of which we met in Paris for sirop de ( raises ? was his taking of boxing-lessons . He had returned to Cambridge and Harvard to work for his doctorate in philosophy , returning already perceptibly Europeanized : he made a point , for a while , a conspicuously unAmerican point , of carrying a cane ? was it a malacca ? ? a little self-conscious about it , and complaining that its " nice conduct " was no such easy matter . He had taken a room in Ash Street , installing in it a small stove ? " something to point the chairs at " ? and a Gaugin Crucifixion , brought from Paris . The suggestion that the latter was a kind of sophisticated primitivism brought the reply , with a waspishness that was characteristic , that there " was nothing primitive about it . " ( A waspishness , let us say parenthetically , that has now and then got him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , or , of Chekhov , " I prefer my Ibsen straight . " ) The boxing lessons , meanwhile , took place at a toughish gymnasium in Boston 's South End , where , under the tutelage of an ex-pugilist with some such monicker as Steve O'Donnell , he learned not only the rudiments of boxing but also , as he put it , " how to swarm with passion up a rope " ? his delight in this attainment was manifest . Was Steve O'Donnell the prototype of Sweeney , as some have suggested ? Anyway , it was our habit to dine together after these gymnastic afternoons , usually at the Greek restaurant in Stuart Street , a small , dirty , and wonderfully inexpensive establishment which was in fact half restaurant and half pool-room ; and it was here on one un196 A REVIEWER 'S ABC fortunate occasion , when he had accidentally hit Steve too hard , that he turned up with a magnificent black eye , a shiner that did Steve great credit : it was really iridescent . What did we talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first " great " era of the comic strip , of Krazy Kat , and Mutt and Jeff , and Rube Goldberg 's elaborate lunacies : it was also perhaps the most creative period of American slang , and in both these departments of invention he took enormous pleasure . How delighted we were with the word " dinge " for negro ! This rich native creativeness was to be reflected , of course , in his poetry , notably in Prufrock , just as our dear deplorable friend , Miss X , the precieuse riducule to end all preciosity , serving tea so exquisitely among her bric-a-brac , was to be pinned like a butterfly to a page in Portrait of a Lady . But more immediately it gave rise to the series of hilariously naughty parerga which was devoted spasmodically to that singular and sterling character known as King Bolo , not to mention King Bolo 's Queen , " that airy fairy hairy-'un , who led the dance on Golder 's Green with Cardinal Bessarion . " These admirable stanzas , notable at times for their penetrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of cynical counterpoint to the study of Sanskrit and the treatise on epistemology . Their influence on the development of a Style will no doubt come in due course to the attention of Herr Dr. Krapp of Wien . But what did we talk about ? What to write , of course , and how to write , and what to read ? Charles Louis Philippe and Vildrac , fresh from Paris ? but also increasingly , and perhaps more concernedly , where to live , and how . Europe ? And if so London , or Paris ? Could one successfully lay siege to either , and how should one go about it ? A year or so later , letters of introduction took me to London , and to W. H. Davies in Little Russell Street , to Rupert Brooke in Gray 's Inn , to Edward Thomas , Harold Munro , and Ezra Pound . With me also was the typescript of Prufrock , typed by its author with meticulous care on a Blickensderfer which produced only italics , and La Figlia the Piange , neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years later he was a convert , if this side idolatry ? thought Prufrock bordered on " insanity . " But Pound , serving tea not so exquisitely among his beautiful Gaudiers , recognized Pruf rock instantly , and this was the beginning . The beginning of the war , too : which was to wash Eliot up in London , back from Marburg , where he had just begun his studies , and myself in Boston . Where to live ? The letters are full ( 1927 ) William Faulkner 197 of the question . England was clearly impossible . " A people which is satisfied with such disgusting food is not civilized . " London is at first detested . But Oxford , and Merton with its " Alexandrian verse , nuts and wine , " the professors with pregnant wives and sprawling children and hideous pictures on their walls , makes him long even for London , perhaps to work in the British Museum . " Come , let us desert our wives , and fly to a land where there are no Medici prints , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do n't like to be dead . " Conversation , yes ? but where to find it ? Well , " Pound is rather intelligent as a talker : his verse is touchingly incompetent . " " 0 Conversation , the staff of life , shall I get any at Oxford ? " Then follows his War Poem , for the $zoo prize , entitled UP BOYS AND AT ' EM ! Adapted to the tune of " C. Columbo lived in Spain , " and within the compass of the average male or female voice , and a new stanza of King Bolo . And he adds " I am keen on rhymes in - een . " As for more serious work , he writes : " I think you criticize my work too leniently . It still seems to me strained and intellectual . " ( This refers to an unfinished poem , never published , called The Love Song of St. Sebastian . ) " I know the kind of verse I want , and I know that this is n't it , and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ( as some of my old stuff does satisfy me ? whether it be good or not ) for years . I feel it more and more . And I do n't know whether I want to . Why should one worry about that ? I feel that such matters take care of themselves , and have no dependence upon our planning . " I ca n't say that I always understand My own meaning when I would be very fine . But the fact is that I have nothing planned Except perhaps to be a moment merry . . . The prediction is uncanny : for the year is 1915 . FAULKNER , WILLIAM ( 1927 ) Mr. Faulkner has a sense of character ; he has a sense of humor ; he has a sense of style ; and for his new novel , Mosquitoes , he has found an amusing and more or less original setting . He // places his odd miscellaneous group of people ? second-rate artists and second-rate hosts and a couple of Tough Guys ( one male , and one female ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such action as there is ) takes place in the week of a cruise . To say that there is not a great deal of action is in the present instance no disparagement ; for the charm of Mr. Faulkner 's highly entertaining novel resides almost entirely in the astonishing lifelikeness and immediacy of his " scene " ; the comings and goings , the absurd actions , the drunken conversations , of his people , recorded hour by hour , almost minute by minute . The dialogue is as good , in its way , as Mr. Hemingway 's ; it is " tough talk " straight off the street and out of the dance halls ; it has the unmistakable rhythm of living speech ; and when Mr. Faulkner also wishes to give us " highbrow " talk ? the aesthetic discussions of his novelist ( for whom one guesses a living prototype ) ? he does so with wit and color and an intelligence that is occasionally sharp to the point of brilliance . There is a great deal of talk in the book ? so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost better have been a play ; a farcecomedy . And the talk falls naturally and easily into scenes . One suspects that it would take very little pruning and shaping to turn the thing into an actable affair , with the characters just enough broadened into caricature to make them easily actable . To mark all this , and to mark the fact that Mr. Faulkner writes well ( in the main ) and that he has the gift , rare enough in writers of fiction , of making scenes and people come vividly alive before us , with something of Katherine Mansfield 's sense of light and texture , and a good deal of Mr. Huxley 's erudition , is to define one 's appreciation of Mosquitoes as a distinctly unusual and amusing book . It is good enough to make one wish that it were better , and to make one hope that Mr. Faulkner will outgrow certain mannerisms which now tend rather seriously to come between him and his reader . He has , distinctly , the fault of many young writers of today ( and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock , a desire to see how naughty he can be , and how very , very sophisticated he can appear . This results in a good many blemishes in the book , one or two of which are both unpardonable and useless . If these minor episodes and anecdotes and innuendoes served any valid purpose ; if they threw , for example , any sort of light on a particular character , or in any way forwarded the course of ( 1927 ) William Faulkner 199 the action , then one might conceivably forgive them . But there is no such justification ; they appear to be a wanton selfindulgence . This is a great pity , draws the attention of the reader away from the book 's true excellence , and does , further , a good deal to invalidate it . Moreover , Mr. Faulkner has an unfortunate addiction to preciosity . He has an ungoverned appetite for purple passages ; and when he is purple , his purple is of the purplest . It screams . One gets heartily sick of his blanched moons , spreading their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boneless ceaseless hands , on the boneless and ceaseless water . One positively faints when he indulges himself ( as all too frequently ) in romantic fantasy , usually couched in italics , as part of the interior monologue of a character who is undergoing stress of emotion . On these occasions he gets off into a mawkish and morbid world that reeks of patchouli and Beardsley and anemic Bakst and a kind of morbidezza that has a sickly flavor as of Baudelaire and rose water . One resents these pseudo-poetic intrusions ? they would be somewhat out of place even if well done . For the rest of the story is excellent realistic satire ; pungent to the nostril , brilliant to the eye , palpable , if somewhat coarse , to the touch . Here and there , one feels that Mr. Faulkner 's hand has shaken a little . One gets the impression , for example , that when he began the book , he intended to make his sculptor , Gordon , the chief character , or , at any rate , one of the chief characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon slipped into the background , only to be rather hastily resurrected at the end . In the same way , his novelist , Fairchild , undergoes a kind of queer metamorphosis in midstream ; he suddenly becomes a rather different Fairchild ( and it must be admitted a more plausible one ) from the Fairchild whom we encounter at the outset . From such accidents one gathers the impression that Mr. Faulkner , having been seized by the excellent suggestion of scene and " crowd " that his setting supplied for him , gave himself up to reckless improvisation , and allowed the story to run away from him . The story has the brilliance of improvisation , but also its shapelessness . These defects being admitted , the critic must also admit , and without a shadow of reluctance , that the book is a delightful one . And one adds Mr. Faulkner 's name to the small list of // those from whom one might reasonably expect , in the course of a few years , a really first-rate piece of fiction . FAULKNER , WILLIAM ( 1939 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , the more I consider the less can I conceive where you picked up that style " ? might with advantage have been saved for Mr. William Faulkner . For if one thing is more outstanding than another about Mr. Faulkner ? some readers find it so outstanding , indeed , that they never get beyond it ? it is the uncompromising and almost hypnotic zeal with which he insists upon having a style , and , especially of late , the very peculiar style which he insists upon having . Perhaps to that one should add that he insists when he remembers ? he can write straightforwardly enough when he wants to ; he does so often in the best of his short stories ( and they are brilliant ) , often enough , too , in the novels . But that style is what he really wants to get back to ; and get back to it he invariably does . And what a style it is , to be sure ! The exuberant and tropical luxuriance of sound which Jim Europe 's jazz band used to exhale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking shape before one 's eyes ? magnificently and endlessly intervolved , glisteningly and ophidianly in motion , coil sliding over coil , and leaf and flower forever magically interchanging ? was scarcely more bewildering , in its sheer inexhaustible fecundity , than Mr. Faulkner 's style . Small wonder if even the most passionate of Mr. Faulkner 's admirers ? among whom the present writer honors himself by enlisting ? must find , with each new novel , that the first fifty pages are always the hardest , that each time one must learn all over again how to read this strangely fluid and slippery and heavily mannered prose , and that one is even , like a kind of Laocoon , sometimes tempted to give up . Wrestle , for example , with two very short ( for Mr. Faulkner ! ) sentences , taken from an early page of Absalom , Absalom ! Meanwhile , as though in inverse ratio to the vanishing voice , the invoked ghost of the man whom she could neither forgive nor revenge herself upon began to assume a quality almost of solidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( 1939 ) William Faulkner 2o r hell , its aura of unregeneration , it mused ( mused , thought , seemed to possess sentience as if , though dispossessed of the peace ? who was impervious anyhow to fatigue ? which she declined to give it , it was still irrevocably outside the scope of her hurt or harm ) with that quality peaceful and now harmless and not even very attentive ? the ogre-shape which , as Miss Codfield 's voice went on , resolved out of itself before Quentin 's eyes the two half-ogre children , the three of them forming a shadowy background for the fourth one . Well , it may be reasonably questioned whether , on page thirteen of a novel , that little cordite bolus of suppressed references is n't a thumping aesthetic mistake . Returned to , when one has finished the book , it may be as simple as daylight ; but encountered for the first time , and no matter how often reread , it guards its enigma with the stony impassivity of the Sphinx . Or take again from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faulkner 's latest novel , and certainly one of his finest ? this little specimen of " exposition " : Because he had been born here , on this coast though not in this house but in the other , the residence in town , and had lived here all his life , including the four years at the State University 's medical school and the two years as an intern in New Orleans where ( a thick man even when young , with thick soft woman 's hands , who should never have been a doctor at all , who even after the six more or less metropolitan years looked out from a provincial and insulated amazement at his classmates and fellows : the lean young men swaggering in their drill jackets on which ? to him ? they wore the myriad anonymous faces of the probationer nurses with a ruthless and assured braggadocio like decorations , like flower trophies ) he had sickened for it . What is one to say of that ? or of a sentence only a little lower on the same page which runs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of the later Henry James ? James the Old Pretender ? In short , Mr. Faulkner 's style , though often brilliant and always interesting , is all too frequently downright bad ; and it has inevitably offered an all-too-easy mark for the sharpshooting of such alert critics as Mr. Wyndham Lewis . But if it is easy enough to make fun of Mr. Faulkner 's obsessions for particular words , or his indifference and violence to them , or the parrotlike mechanical mytacism ( for it is really like a stammer ) with which he will go on endlessly repeating such favorites as " myriad , sourceless , impalpable , outrageous , risible , profound , " there is nevertheless something more to be said for his passion for overelaborate sentence structure . // Overelaborate they certainly are , baroque and involuted in the extreme , these sentences : trailing clauses , one after another , shadowily in apposition , or perhaps not even with so much connection as that ; parenthesis after parenthesis , the parenthesis itself often containing one or more parentheses ? they remind one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which when opened disclosed egg after egg , each smaller and subtler than the last . It is as if Mr. Faulkner , in a sort of hurried despair , had decided to try to tell us everything , absolutely everything , every last origin or source or quality or qualification , and every possible future or permutation as well , in one terrifically concentrated effort : each sentence to be , as it were , a microcosm . And it must be admitted that the practice is annoying and distracting . It is annoying , at the end of a sentence , to find that one does not know in the least what was the subject of the verb that dangles in vacuo ? it is distracting to have to go back and sort out the meaning , track down the structure from clause to clause , then only to find that after all it does n't much matter , and that the obscurity was perhaps neither subtle nor important . And to the extent that one is annoyed and distracted , and does thus go back and work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faulkner has defeated his own ends . One has had , of course , to emerge from the stream , and to step away from it , in order properly to see it ; and as Mr. Faulkner works precisely by a process of immersion , of hypnotizing his reader into remaining immersed in his stream , this occasional blunder produces irritation and failure . Nevertheless , despite the blunders , and despite the bad habits and the willful bad writing ( and willful it obviously is ) , the style as a whole is extraordinarily effective ; the reader does remain immersed , wants to remain immersed , and it is interesting to look into the reasons for this . And at once , if one considers these queer sentences not simply by themselves , as monsters of grammar or awkwardness , but in their relation to the book as a whole , one sees a functional reason and necessity for their being as they are . They parallel in a curious and perhaps inevitable way , and not without aesthetic justification , the whole elaborate method of deliberately withheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which so often gives the characteristic shape to the novels themselves . It is a persistent offering of obstacles , a calculated system of screens and obtrusions , of confusions and ambiguous interpolations and de(1939) William Faulkner 2o3 lays , with one express purpose ; and that purpose is simply to keep the form ? and the idea ? fluid and unfinished , still in motion , as it were , and unknown , until the dropping into place of the very last syllable . What Mr. Faulkner is after , in a sense , is a continuum . He wants a medium without stops or pauses , a medium which is always of the moment , and of which the passage from moment to moment is as fluid and undetectable as in the life itself which he is purporting to give . It is all inside and underneath , or as seen from within and below ; the reader must therefore be steadily drawn in ; he must be powerfully and unremittingly hypnotized inward and downward to that image-stream ; and this suggests , perhaps , a reason not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the repetitiveness as well . The repetitiveness , and the steady iterative emphasis ? like a kind of chanting or invocation ? on certain relatively abstract words ( " sonorous , latin , vaguely eloquent " ) , has the effect at last of producing , for Mr. Faulkner , a special language , a conglomerate of his own , which he uses with an astonishing virtuosity , and which , although in detailed analysis it may look shoddy , is actually for his purpose a life stream of almost miraculous adaptability . At the one extreme it is abstract , cerebral , time-and-space-obsessed , tortured and twisted , but nevertheless always with a living pulse in it ; and at the other it can be as overwhelming in its simple vividness , its richness in the actual , as the flood scenes in The Wild Palms . Obviously , such a style , especially when allied with such a method , and such a concern for method , must make difficulties for the reader ; and it must be admitted that Mr. Faulkner does little or nothing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily available or perceptible . The reader must simply make up his mind to go to work , and in a sense to cooperate ; his reward being that there is a situation to be given shape , a meaning to be extracted , and that half the fun is precisely in watching the queer , difficult , and often so laborious , evolution of Mr. Faulkner 's idea . And not so much idea , either , as form . For , like the great predecessor whom at least in this regard he so oddly resembles , Mr. Faulkner could say with Henry James that it is practically impossible to make any real distinction between theme and form . What immoderately delights him , alike in Sanctuary , The Sound and the Fury , As I Lay Dying , Light in August , Pylon , Absalom , Absalom ! and now again in The Wild Palms , and what sets him above ? shall we say it firmly ? all his // American contemporaries , is his continuous preoccupation with the novel as form , his passionate concern with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly have commanded the interest and respect of Henry James himself . The novel as revelation , the novel as slice-of-life , the novel as mere story , do not interest him : these he would say , like James again , " are the circumstances of the interest , " but not the interest itself . The interest itself will be the use to which these circumstances are put , the degree to which they can be organized . From this point of view , he is not in the least to be considered as a mere " Southern " writer : the " Southernness " of his scenes and characters is of little concern to him , just as little as the question whether they are pleasant or unpleasant , true or untrue . Verisimilitude ? or , at any rate , degree of verisimilitude ? he will cheerfully abandon , where necessary , if the compensating advantages of plan or tone are a sufficient inducement . The famous scene in Sanctuary of Miss Reba and Uncle Bud , in which a " madam " and her cronies hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy gets drunk , is quite false , taken out of its context ; it is not endowed with the same kind of actuality which permeates the greater part of the book at all . Mr. Faulkner was cunning enough to see that a two-dimensional cartoonlike statement , at this juncture , would supply him with the effect of a chorus , and without in the least being perceived as a change in the temperature of truthfulness . That particular kind of dilution , or adulteration , of verisimilitude , was both practiced and praised by James : as when he blandly admitted of In the Cage that his central character was " too ardent a focus of divination " to be quite credible . It was defensible simply because it made possible the coherence of the whole , and was itself absorbed back into the luminous texture . It was for him a device for organization , just as the careful cherishing of " viewpoint " was a device , whether simply or in counterpoint . Of Mr. Faulkner 's devices , of this sort , aimed at the achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the manipulation of viewpoint and the use of the flash-back , or sudden shift of time-scene , forward or backward . In Sanctuary , where the alternation of viewpoint is a little lawless , the complexity is given , perhaps a shade disingenuously , by violent shifts in time ; a deliberate disarrangement of an otherwise straightforward story . Technically , there is no doubt that the novel , despite its fame , rattles a little ; and Mr. Faulkner himself takes pains to disclaim it . But , even done ( 1939 ) William Faulkner 205 with the left hand , it betrays a genius for form , quite apart from its wonderful virtuosity in other respects . Light in August , published a year after Sanctuary , repeats the same technique , that of a dislocation of time , and more elaborately ; the timeshifts alternate with shifts in the viewpoint ; and if the book is a failure it is perhaps because Mr. Faulkner 's tendency to what is almost a hypertrophy of form is not here , as well as in the other novels , matched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the story of Joe Christmas is seen fiercely enough ? by its creator ? to carry off that immense machinery of narrative ; it would have needed another Popeye , or another Jiggs and Shumann , another Temple Drake , and for once Mr. Faulkner 's inexhaustible inventiveness seems to have been at fault . Consequently what we see is an extraordinary power for form functioning relatively in vacuo , and existing only to sustain itself . In the best of the novels , however ? and it is difficult to choose between The Sound and the Fury and The Wild Palms , with Absalom , Absalom ! a very close third ? this tendency to hypertrophy of form has been sufficiently curbed ; and it is interesting , too , to notice that in all these three ( and in that remarkable tour de force , As I Lay Dying , as well ) while there is still a considerable reliance on time-shift , the effect of richness and complexity is chiefly obtained by a very skillful fugue-like alternation of viewpoint . Fugue-like in The Wild Palms ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dying , where the shift is kaleidoscopically rapid , and where , despite an astonishing violence to plausibility ( in the reflections , and language of reflection , of the characters ) an effect of the utmost reality and immediateness is nevertheless produced . Fugue-like , again , in Absalom , Absalom ! where indeed one may say the form is really circular ? there is no beginning and no ending , properly speaking , and therefore no logical point of entrance : we must just submit , and follow the circling of the author 's interest , which turns a light inward towards the center , but every moment from a new angle , a new point of view . The story unfolds , therefore , now in one color of light , now in another , with references backward and forward : those that refer forward being necessarily , for the moment , blind . What is complete in Mr. Faulkner 's pattern , a priori , must nevertheless remain incomplete for us until the very last stone is in place ; what is " real , " therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point of view , turns out to be " unreal " from another ; and we find that one among other thing // with which we are engaged is the fascinating sport of trying to separate truth from legend , watching the growth of legend from truth , and finally reaching the conclusion that the distinction is itself false . Something of the same sort is true also of The Sound and the Fury ? and this , with its massive four-part symphonic structure , is perhaps the most beautifully wrought of the whole series , and an indubitable masterpiece of what James loved to call the " fictive art . " The joinery is flawless in its intricacy ; it is a novelist 's novel ? a whole textbook on the craft of fiction in itself , comparable in its way to What Maisie Knew or The Golden Bowl . But if it is important , for the moment , to emphasize Mr. Faulkner 's genius for form , and his continued exploration of its possibilities , as against the usual concern with the violence and dreadfulness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this score of the fact that the best of Henry James is precisely that group of last novels which so completely concerned themselves with moral depravity ? it is also well to keep in mind his genius for invention , whether of character or episode . The inventiveness is of the richest possible sort ? a headlong and tumultuous abundance , an exuberant generosity and vitality , which makes most other contemporary fiction look very pale and chaste indeed . It is an unforgettable gallery of portraits , whether of character or caricature , and all of them endowed with a violent and immediate vitality . He is at once to quote once more from James one of the most corrupt of writers and one of the most naif , the most mechanical and pedantic , and the fullest of bonhomie and natural impulse . He is one of the finest of artists and one of the coarsest . Viewed in one way , his novels are ponderous , shapeless , overloaded ; his touch is graceless , violent , barbarous . Viewed in another , his tales have more color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention than any others . His style would demand a chapter apart . It is the least simple style , probably , that was ever written ; it bristles , it cracks , it swells and swaggers ; but it is a perfect expression of the man 's genius . Like his genius , it contains a certain quantity of everything , from immaculate gold to flagrant dross . He was a very bad writer , and yet unquestionably he was a very great writer . We may say briefly , that in so far as his method was an instinct it was successful , and that in so far as it was a theory it was a failure . But both in instinct and in theory he had the aid of an immense force of conviction . His imagination warmed to its work so intensely that there was nothing his voli(1926) F. Scott Fitzgerald 207 Lion could not impose upon it . Hallucination settled upon him , and he believed anything that was necessary in the circumstances . That passage , from Henry James 's essay on Balzac , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicable to Mr. Faulkner . All that is lacking is Balzac 's greater range of understanding and tenderness , his greater freedom from special preoccupations . For this , one would hazard the guess that Mr. Faulkner has the gifts ? and time is still before him . FITZGERALD , F. SCOTT ? ( 1926 ) American criticism is seldom responsibly aware of contemporary figures , and for that reason one can say that the deaths of Melville , Crane , and James , in successive decades , aroused in the American consciousness little sense of loss . They were gone , it is true : but as their presence had been little felt , and their influence had been practically negligible , their departure left little awareness , as it should have done , that there were no writers of fiction to take their places . As a matter of fact , American criticism was all too cheerfully convinced that in the diagnostic inventions of Frank Norris and Mr. Upton Sinclair , in the short stories of O. Henry , and above all in the cumbersome journalistic epics of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No criticism is so fascinated by the ephemeral as American criticism , or so careless of the past in its appraisal of the present . It is joyfully headlong in its passionate pursuit of the autochthonous , it delights to find queer geniuses in queer corners ( it finds them every day ) , and if they are n't too queer , too complicated , it treats them all alike : with magnificent generosity . It is sufficient comment on the results of this tendency to note that in the recent abridged Cambridge History of American Literature ? A Short History of American Literature ? which purported to be an authoritative and complete survey by American critics of good standing , Melville was dismissed in four scant pages as a sea-romance ruined by metaphysics , while Crane and Emily Dickinson were not even mentioned . But what does it matter ? This shortness of memory , and this // indiscriminateness of taste , combine to produce for American critics an illusion of perpetual novelty and inexhaustible plenty . The great realistic novelist , who reappears every ten years as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis , is always perfectly and surprisingly new . Great new poets emerge , have a moment 's unprecedented glory , and are swallowed up in oblivion . The American language is periodically rediscovered and employed ? always , of course , for the first time . Here , for example , is its latest practitioner , Mr. Lardner , an admirable journalistic humorist , whose sketches of baseball characters have been delighting American newspaper readers for several years . Mr. Lardner writes in an amusing vernacular , and he has a satiric vein which is just good enough ( if coarse , and not infrequently cheap ) to carry one safely through a first reading . Further than that , one can not go : it is impossible to agree with those critics who , perhaps a little thrilled at having discovered Mr. Lardner 's striking talent on the sports page of a newspaper , suggest that he is another Mark Twain , and that his short stories " are the best ever written by an American . " Mr. Lardner 's gift is a small one . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genial , gum-chewing " roughneck " : shrewd , humorous , immature , self-deceiving , pathetically gregarious and romantic : and this type he uses again and again , male or female , old or young , always with the same vernacular . The vernacular is skillfully caught , the orthography is entertaining , but Mr. Lardner relies too much upon it , and it becomes tiresome . As for the story , the plot , the psychology , the art ? one has only to put the best of Mr. Lardner ( " The Champion , " in How To Write Short Stories ) beside Stephen Crane 's Maggie . In Maggie , one sees the same sort of material , American language and all , used by a poet for the making of a genuine and moving piece of literature . Nowhere , in Mr. Lardner 's two books , is there any slightest attempt to achieve that sort of alchemy . Mr. Lardner seeks , like Mr. Will Rogers , to entertain ; and in that he often delightfully succeeds . And so does Miss Loos , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loos has one great advantage over Mr. Lardner ? she has published only one book , and in this she has not attempted , with any elaborateness , to create more than one character . This character ( caricature ) is exactly the sort that Mr. Lardner might have conceived ? the vernacular is remarkably like ( so much so that one could transpose passages from Gullible 's Travels to Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , ( 1926 ) F. Scott Fitzgerald tog and vice versa , without the slightest jar to contexts ) and the wit moves in the same manner , a manner familiar to anyone who knows the American vaudeville stage : laconically eccentric , laconically exaggerative , laconically depreciative , laconically shocking . Miss Loos uses this manner more sharply than Mr. Lardner , and manages to say , in the course of her book , a greater number of memorably absurd things ; and the European tour of her beautiful baleful blonde affords a more various scene for satire than Mr. Lardner has been able to find on the baseball diamond or at Palm Beach . Of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abyss . And surely there was never before , in a tale so reckless of conventional morals , a discretion so miraculous . Miss Loos ' terrifying blonde , so infinitely more deadly than any of the males she encounters , employs in this regard a perfection of technique which is really beautiful in one so young and ( apparently ) so ingenuous . It reminds one , however , that the profession is among the most honorable and ancient . Nevertheless , Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , like Mr. Lardner 's Gullible 's Travels , is an ephemerid . Is it likely that Miss Loos will do anything better , or will even experience a desire to do so ? Her limitations are those of Mr. Lardner ? one guesses that her vein is small , that she has no great resources ( save as an entertainer ) and that she would probably be a little surprised if one urged her to move up from the class of The Young Visiters to something better . . . And it is because he does , in this sense , try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed in better company than Miss Loos or Mr. Lardner afford him . Mr. Fitzgerald has enjoyed a spectacular career as a writer of short stories for American magazines ; and in these , as well as in This Side of Paradise , his first novel , he showed ( mixed with much magazine shoddy ) enough ability to make one fearful lest he should allow himself to be manipulated , by his audience and by his success , as O. Henry was manipulated . In his latest collection of stories , All The Sad Young Men , he appears still all too manipulatable ; though in one or two of the stories he also makes it evident that his conscience is not yet wholly dead . Absolution is an attempt at a close psychological study of hysteria which has good things in it but as a whole is somewhat forced : one feels that Mr. Fitzgerald is not speaking his own language . In this , and in The Rich Boy , he fails to detach , and to make clear , his effect ? so much so that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In The Great Gatsby , however , Mr. Fitzgerald has written a // highly colored and brilliant little novel which , by grace of one cardinal virtue , quite escapes the company of most contemporary American fiction ? it has excellence of form . It is not great , it is not large , it is not strikingly subtle ; but it is well imagined and shaped , it moves swiftly and neatly , its scene is admirably seized and admirably matched with the theme , and its hard bright tone is entirely original . Technically , it appears to owe much to the influence of the cinema ; and perhaps also something to Henry James ? a peculiar conjunction , but not so peculiar if one reflects on the flash-backs and close-ups and paralleled themes of that " little experiment in the style of Gyp , " The Awkward Age . Mr. Fitzgerald 's publishers call The Great Gatsby a satire . This is deceptive . It is only incidentally a satire , it is only in the setting that it is satirical , and in the tone provided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main figure , are tragic , and it is precisely the fantastic vulgarity of the scene which gives to the excellence of Gatsby 's soul its finest bouquet , and to his tragic fate its sharpest edge . All of Mr. Fitzgerald 's people are real ? but Gatsby comes close to being superb . Ile is betrayed to us slowly and skillfully , and with a keen tenderness which in the end makes his tragedy a deeply moving one . By so much , therefore , The Great Gatsby is better than a mere satire of manners , and better than Mr. Fitzgerald 's usual sort of superficial cleverness . If only he can refrain altogether in future from the sham romanticism and sham sophistication which the magazines demand of him , and give another turn of the screw to the care with which he writes , he may well become a first-rate novelist . How deeply does he feel ? That is the question , a question we do not ask of Miss Loos or Mr. Lardner . FLETCHER , JOHN GOULD ( 1921 ) Balzac once remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily make the mistake of assuming that there could not conceivably be an artist who might not say of himself the same thing . The remark applies with particular force to that sort of artist whose work is " charged , " who is at his best when his pages have " flight , " whose method , in other words , is in the nature of half-deliberately guided improvisation . It hardly applies , if it
