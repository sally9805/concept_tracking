RILKE : MAN AND POET ( 373 pp. ) - Nora Wydenbruck-Appleton - Century - Crofts ( $4 ) . <P> Sofia Rilke was annoyed . Had not the daughter of an Imperial Councillor , the wife of the Inspector of the Bohemian Northern Railway , a right to expect that her prayers for a daughter would be graciously granted ? Yet here it was , a boy after all . In a foolish pet , Sofia decided to raise her son as a daughter , anyway . She put up his hair in braids , kept him in pretty frocks and dainty underwear , set him to playing with dolls and little girls , and called him " Sophie . " <P> So life , like a bee at a rose , began very early to torment Rainer Maria Rilke . It tormented him unceasingly for 51 years , extracting from him a rarefied poetry that has delighted the palates of European esthetes for the last quarter-century . Yet Rilke 's poetic flavors-and the morbid scent of wet rot that rises from his life-have prevented many a poetry reader from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their best chance yet to get acquainted with him . Nora Wydenbruck 's biography , the first to be published in the U.S. , gives a good introduction to Rilke 's poetry and his life . The story it tells is unearthly strange , more like the biography of a phantom than a man . <P> Rapture in a Frock Coat . When Rilke was eleven , his father suddenly yanked him away from his dolls and shoved him into a military academy to make a man of him . Such a sudden change in weather might have cracked tougher spirits , and young Rilke barely kept from going to pieces . At 16 , he finally persuaded his family to let him study the classics and go on to the university . Soon he was a well-known figure in the streets of Prague , a wraith-pale young man in a black frock coat and broad-brimmed hat , drifting vaguely along in a rapture with a long-stemmed iris he held before him like a votive candle . <P> After two years at the university , Rilke tagged about Europe for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lou Andreas-Salom . Then he settled down in an art colony in Worpswede , Germany , where he met and married Clara Westhoff , a handsome young sculptress . Suddenly the poet 's constitutional melancholy grew acute . He had discovered that he could not keep a wife and a muse at the same time . The wife graciously bowed out ; Rilke went off to Paris , where in 1905 he became private secretary to Sculptor Auguste Rodin . <P> Summer in a Tangerine . In the years preceding the first World War he hopscotched furiously about Europe-Rome , Berlin , Venice , Madrid-in pursuit of inspiration . Soon his New Poems and The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge were making him the talk of European intellectuals . From his large , sensual mouth came a flood of such poetic fancies as his description of a tangerine , " in which a summer is folded up very small like an Italian silk handkerchief in a nutshell . " <P> Then came the first World War . It tore through Rilke like a tank through a cobweb . Not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks of tremendous effort at the Chteau de Muzot , near Sierre , Switzerland , he wrote the Sonnets to Orpheus and completed the Duino Elegies , a series of ten long poems starred ten years before at Duino Castle on the Adriatic .
