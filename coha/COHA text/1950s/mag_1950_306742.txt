From 1917 until the day after Pearl Harbor , John Benjamin Powell edited and published a courageous , respected Shanghai newsmagazine called the China Weekly Review . Clapped into prison by the Japanese , J.B. suffered starvation and gangrene that hastened his death ( TIME , March 10 , 1947 ) . Behind him , Powell left a son to carry on . Last week , in a Communist Shanghai that was virtually deserted by Americans , 31-year-old John William Powell was still publishing the Review . Old J.B. , who called no man master , would have been surprised and shocked at its subservient tone . Son Bill had become an outright apologist for Communism . <P> Born in Shanghai and educated ( like his father ) at the Missouri School of Journalism , young Powell worked for the Office of War Information in China during World War II . In 1945 , as editorial regent for his ailing father , Bill soon recaptured the Review 's old readers among the U.S. , British and English-speaking Chinese communities , who were glad to see the weekly revived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position as an independent critic of both the Nationalists and the Communists . After Red troops finally took Shanghai in 1949 , the Review hailed the city 's " liberation , " lavishly praised " the new democracy , " and began demanding Formosa 's " liberation " from Chiang Kai-shek 's " henchmen . " The Review 's version of life in the U.S. became a red-and-pink patchwork quilt , sewn together from such dependably left-wing sources as the speeches of Howard Fast and George Seldes ' news letter In Fact . Wrote the Review : " The United States , in the eyes of the Chinese people , has become the symbol of world reaction . " <P> Even the Review 's traditional English lessons for Chinese readers have become party-line jabberwocky . One recent issue analyzed the sentence : " Pa may be a thoughtful union man in the shop , but when he picks up a magazine , he likes to study the ads for new cars . " The Review explained that " Pa " was slang for " father . " Then it added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically ... He does not want to be informed , he wants merely to escape into a dream world in his leisure hours . " With Editor Powell 's homeland now fighting his friends in Korea , old J.B. 's admirers waited to see if son Bill would escape from his own dream world .
