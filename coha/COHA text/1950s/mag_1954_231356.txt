A multi-stamped envelope mailed from Belgium was delivered to my desk the other day . It contained a letter written by a priest , who explained that he had been studying sociology in Europe . He requested that his name not be used , but thought that I and perhaps other TIME readers might be interested in a recent experience he had with the magazine . This is his story : <P> <P> The August 23 issue of TIME rescued me from the hands of the Communist police of the Russian zone of Germany . I feel , now that I am once again on free ground , that I owe it to you to let you know how your publication was responsible for this rather extraordinary feat . Rescue often comes to the " children of light " from very unexpected sources , and I must say TIME was a rather unlikely candidate for the job at the time . <P> <P> The morning of the day that I was taken into custody by the Volkspolizei of the East zone , I had worked in the Ost-Europa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including references from the Russian Encyclopedia . <P> <P> It was my luck that day , upon leaving the institute , to board the wrong elevated train . When the train stopped , I found myself in the Russian zone with a People 's Policeman asking for identification . I thought first of the scraps of notepaper in my pockets , including what the Russian Encyclopedia has to say about the cardinals in Vatican City , which had amused me greatly while copying it down . <P> Upon the discovery that my identification did not allow me to be in the Russian zone , my People 's Policeman conducted me unceremoniously to the police station . There I was put through a minor third-degree . After about an hour , I was taken to a barracks on the edge of a park . There the questioning began in earnest . How many American soldiers are there in Italy ? Did I come from a rich family ? Who paid for my studies and travel in Europe ? What about the Nazis in South America ? What about Guatemala ? What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> <P> Later that night , after answering questions until I was very tired and nervous , a Russian official came to me . The German Polizei had gradually vanished and it was the Russians I was dealing with now . They wanted to see what I had in my pockets . I was petrified . They had not searched me until now . I thought about the notes . I absolutely refused to show them anything from my pockets , and told them to release me immediately . <P> <P> They refused , pointing out that I was in a People 's Democracy . I replied that I would like to have them know that my name and address were registered with the West German police , who would soon have an order out to look for me . Then I pulled TIME out of my pocket and gave it to them . <P> <P> I do n't know why I did it . It worked ! Along with my South American passport , I guess they were n't prepared psychologically to find TIME in my pocket . They bleated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among themselves that perhaps I had something to do with the Americans . TIME had done the trick . <P> <P> Minutes later I was being taken to the station in the company of a policeman . I was put on a train for West Berlin without having to pay for the ticket , and was glad to be leaving without any further delay . <P>
