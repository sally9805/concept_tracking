One of the neatest Communist maneuvers of the Chinese civil war was pulled off in November 1949 at Hong Kong 's airfield , where 82 Nationalist transport planes had been flown in to presumed safety . Subverted by agents , most of their Chinese crews defected to the Reds . They grabbed eleven of the planes and took off for Mao 's mainland . Hong Kong authorities announced that British recognition of the Communist government-then expected momentarily-would automatically give the Reds possession of the remaining 71 planes by right of inheritance . It was strange logic , explainable only by Hong Kong 's greedy haste to make friends with Mao . <P> Shooing Away . The Nationalists reacted quickly . Before Britain formally recognized the Reds in January 1950 , they had sold the planes to Civil Air Transport , Inc . ( C.A.T. ) , a corporation chartered in the U.S. by Major General Claire Chennault of wartime Flying Tiger fame , longtime air adviser to Chiang Kaishek . Then came two years of expensive court cases ; each time , the Hong Kong courts upheld the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the British airfield where the planes were parked : they shooed away all visitors . Finally Chennault took his appeal to Britain 's court of last resort , the Lords of Appeal of the high &; mighty Privy Council in London . Bewigged Sir Hartley Shawcross , Q.C. , Laborite attorney general and now a top-priced barrister , pleaded Chennault 's case . <P> Last week the Communist coup of 1949 was dramatically undone . The Privy Council reversed the Hong Kong judgments . A few hours later , at 2 a.m. , 500 heavily armed British police and troops descended upon the Hong Kong airfield . They seized the disputed planes , rounded up 150 sleepy Communist guards who sullenly chanted Red songs as they were hauled away in trucks . Two days later , 40 of the planes bearing the insignia CATC ( for the former Central Air Transport Corp. ) were turned over to C.A.T . The remaining 31 , involved in similar litigation , will unquestionably be awarded to C.A.T. , too . <P> The seizure was a conspicuous loss of face for the Communists ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes ( mostly C-46s and DC-38 , plus six DC-48 and five Convairs ) , along with thousands of spare parts , are worth an estimated $30 million , the biggest piece of airline property in East Asia . The Communists expecting to hang on to the planes , had kept most of them carefully mothballed and in good condition . Hong Kong nervously got set for reprisals against British business . <P> Keeping Away . Vacationing at his home in Monroe , La. , Chennault announced that his Formosa-based C.A.T.-which operates a fleet of 30 airliners over 3,100 miles of airways from Tokyo to Bangkok - will first overhaul , then charter or sell the planes . Said Chennault : " My interest is to keep them away from the Reds . This is the first Communist defeat in the Far East . That 's the thing I take the most pride in. "
