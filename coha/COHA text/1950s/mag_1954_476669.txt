wE CAN almost hear the rich hoarse voice of Sir Winston Churchill in some of the pages of his new volume , Triumph and Tragedy ( Houghton Mifflin , $6 , Book-of-theMonth Club choice for December ) , which is the sixth and last ' of a series covering the second world war . It is boldly and clearly organized . It is decisively , energetically , often warmly written . It draws on many almost inaccessible records , long experience of political and military strategy , comprehensive grasp of many historical and geographical problems , and a unique personal relationship with many Allied and neutral leaders . Everyone who wants to understand the last war should read it . Anyone who attempts to write a history of the last war will read and often reread it . It confirms the view that Churchill is one of the greatest warriors of our century . Still , it is not wholly satisfying as history . In the preface , Sir Winston calls it part of his " personal narrative " of the war . He says : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of Great Britain . " If so , we should expect hint to deal primarily with British enterprises in the war ; and , next , with Anglo-American and other Allied adventures : all as seen from 10 Downing Street . Sometimes he does this in great detail ; but sometimes he is discreet , or careless , or personal . It is possible to divine the sources he is using , and to observe when he changes from one to another . First is his diary as Minister of Defense . ( In the chapter on-the German Vi bombs , one subheading reads " Allied Counter-Measures " and the next " I Appoint a Small Committee . " ) Next and inure important is his diary as Prime Minister , supplemented by Foreign Office telegrams , transcripts of diplomatic exchanges , and other high-level documentary records . And third is a purely personal diary , from which Sir Winstondraws a variety of minor details which will appeal to some readers and annoy others . Some of the jokes are very amusing . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Ibn Saud , who as a Moslem did not allow smoking or drinking in his presence . He goes on : As I was the host at luncheon , I . said to the interpreter that if it was the religion of His Majesty to deprive himself of smoking and alcohol I must point out that my rule of life prescribed as an absolutely sacred rite smoking cigars and also the drinking of alcohol before , after , and if need be during all meals and in the intervals between them . The King graciously accepted the position . It is a little naughty , but quite funny , The rest of the account covers the exchange of presents , handsomely feudal . Sarah Churchill got robes and perfumes and jewels ? all given to the Treasury , the all-consuming British Treasury . Now , this personal stuff is gay and irrelevant ; the casual reader will scarcely notice that it entirely conceals the purpose and the result of Churchill 's meeting with King Ibn Saud . No hint is given of the subject under discussion ? which must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oasis had been removed to ensure privacy . No hint is given of the results , or of any development in the relations between Saudi Arabia and the British Government . The passage ends with the utterly insignificant information that Sir Winston 's plane to England was diverted to Lyneham because of fog : " I drove on to London by car , stopping at Reading to join my wife , who had come to meet me . " Another of these tactful but unrevealing narratives covers a bleeding sore in the Anglo-American alliance . Churchill visited the British commander Alexander at Siena in 1944 . The American General Devers arrived . Alexander , " gay , smiling , debonair , " almost immediately went out and did not return . Churchill says he was conscious of a tension between the two men , " beneath an impeccable surface of politeness . " Well , not entirely impeccable , perhaps ; but could he not explain the whole thing a little more clearly , now that he is writing a history of the war we won together ? THE book therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even more important Allied history ; but it is apt to change from one point of view to another at any moment ; and in fact it does not fully record either the British effort or the fortunes of the - Grand Alliance . " It was apparently written ? so far as Sir Winston wrote it ? during his period as Leader of the Opposition , has been virtually dropped since , and has been only partially filled out by assistants and subeditors . Some of them scent to be dittifid historians and statisticians . The galley proofs of the book , as one reviewer received them , contained only blanks for the numbers of Japanese shipping tons sunk by Allied naval action : these figures were filled in by last-minute checking before the book was set up in pages . A few attempts have been made to expand or to balance Churchill 's descriptions of important events by reference to other histories of the war ; but they are few indeed . Some great phases of the conflict are described in exhaustive detail ? for example , the Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one British Empire unit took part ) , is narrated in about fifteen pages with illustrative maps . But others are practically ignored . The climax of the Japanese war occupies only half a page , because , Sir Winston observes , its " closing scenes . . . took place after I left office " ( p. 645 ) . Surely this is unworthy of a man who has the history of two world wars in his mind , and who might well ? even if he was wounded by his temporary expulsion from office in Britain , and even if he felt the conquest of Japan was mainly American ? have written a deathless chapter on that historic event . It is not likely either that most readers will profit from the endless telegrams and minutes with which the book is packed . Official telegrams are always pretty dull to read , even when urgent . Obsolete official telegrams are much duller ? except for experts who can treat them as the material of a history still to be written . If , instead of giving us transcriptS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir Winston and his assistants had had time to digest the entire controversy and to make its main issues as clear as is humanly possible , we should all be in his debt . As it is , we know something ; we are terribly conscious of the difficulties ; but we are left dissatisfied with the presentation of that tragic episode . PPARENTLY the book was boldly sketched out and then inadequately filled in . From the point of view of composition it is much inferior to Eisenhower 's Crusade in Europe . But it is better written ( at least where it is ? not composed of telegrams ) ; it is packed with information unobtainable elsewhere , and with uniquely Churchillian points of view . These illuminate both Sir Winston 's character and some important events of recent history . One singular characteristic is his belief that heads of states can always reach an agreement , and that it is ' only their assistants , " informers , " or foreign offices , who destroy confidence . The U. S. State Department is mentioned coldly , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill and F. D. R. Stalin often appears as a determined but genial old fellow , who would listen to reason over a conference table but was liable to be misinformed and hardened when left alone in the Kremlin . The astute and contemptible Russian trick of waiting outside Warsaw while the Polish resistance was slaughtered by the Germans might seem to be the invention of Stalin 's advisers , who overcame his better nature . The fact that Stalin did not ask a single question when told of the atom bomb is put down not to the fact that Fuchs and Nunn May and the Rosenberg group had already sent him plans of it , but to the idea that he had never heard of such a thing in his life . This naivete makes some people call Churchill the greatest mind of the seventeenth century ; but no , he may be one of the most powerful minds of the later twentieth ? which Spengler called " the era of warring Caesarisms . " This may also account for his surprising outburst of anger at the shooting of Mussolini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he immediately cabled Alexander asking whether the man who did the shooting had " any authority " to shoot Mussolini 's mistress : a fantastic inquiry , which the Field Marshal no doubt passed on to some impassive captain to file and forget . The finest part of the entire book is its cool realistic appraisal of the great redeployment of Forces which has taken place since 1945 , ' which few in this country or in Britain foresaw , and to which we are now painfully and unwillingly readjusting our entire lives and hopes . In a single sentence ( pp. 602-3 ) , Churchill explains how the world would have been ? if not at peace , at least far closer to peace , if Russia had been contained within her own boundaries or as close to them as possible , and if the new imperialism had not been permitted to colonize or to menace most of Central Europe . Since then , other great territories have been engulfed , and more are threatened or infected . This , Churchill makes dear , he fore-98 NEW saw ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech and on other occasions ) he was met with jeers or protests . Other equally percipient remarks occur in his negotiations toward the close of the war : for example , when he said to the Communist ruler of Poland , Bierut : It was easy to call everyone who was not a Communist a Fascist beast ; but between these two extremes there lay great and powerful forces which were neither one nor the other , and had no intention of being one or the other . The most penetrating of all these utterances is his final message to the liberated Italians , issued in August 1944 . It is a collection of what he calls " title-deeds for the new Italy " : it would serve for a statement of basic democracy everywhere . It is too long to reprint here , but I hope it will often be copied from page 127 of his book , and meditated by many governments and by the people who appoint them . Churchill means - it and believes it , He is not a gangster , nor a " scientific " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in all , he is a man . Miniaturists I T is not too hard to write one short story . As some of the magazines show , it is not hard at all to find a formula and write dozens of short stories within its comforting embrace . But it is awfully hard to produce a collection of short stories which can be read straight through and will not strike the reader as monotonous or repetitious . A. E. Coppard was probably the master of variety in English ; but his tales were so peculiar , they sometimes seemed to be imaginative poetry rather than descriptions of life . Successful short-story writers seem to work in two ways . Some of them keep down the fine writing , and concentrate on varying the plots and shapes of their stories : so that thirty tales will give thirty widely different views of life . This is the method of Erskine Caldwell , whose ninety-six Complete Stories have been collected by Ditell , Sloan and Pearce/Little , Brown ( 55 ) . They are nearly all told in the tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't steal Lud BOOKS Moseley 's calico horse , " or even ungrammatically : " You could n't see no stars , you could n't see no moon . " They are told in short simple sentences , and seldom are the sentences grouped into long paragraphs . The people in them are not explained . They talk , or listen , or look , or act . The reader is an invisible observer . Part of his pleasure is to infer their character and motives from their conduct . Caldwell leaves him to do that : what he discovers is sometimes horrifying , sometimes wildly amusing , sometimes full of pathos , sometimes savagely bitter . ' Caldwell is brilliant also at changing the shape of his stories so that they fit their leading characters . The inconsequence and misunderstandings of the young , the misplaced energy of the mature , the selfishness and weakness of the old as well as their gentleness and surrender , all these are conveyed in the curves of Caldwell 's story-lines . The only doubt which some readers will have is the doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exaggerate in order to make an impression , and omit in order to suit his own beliefs ; whether behavior like that described in Tobacco Road ever existed anywhere ; whether a farmer would watch his young wife walk into the woods with a stranger , hear her squeal , and then go off to sleep on his own porch . A number of his plots seem utterly incredible ; but he makes them convincing because he writes so clearly . At his best and simplest , he is very good indeed . I read " The First Autumn " and " Country Full of Swedes " many years ago , I have never forgotten them , and they are as good as ever . T HE other type of short-story writer cultivates elaborate style , poetic imagination , psychological penetration . Two admirable collections of this kind have recently appeared : The Honeyed Peace , by Martha Gellhorn ( Doubleday , $350 ) , and The Passionate North , by William Sansom ( Harcourt , Brace , $3.50 ) . Mr. Sansom 's tales are ( as he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the lands of brief summer : Scandinavia and northern Scotland . Some are laid in towns , some in deserts of heath or rock , the characters vary widely , but NEW BOOKS every story is penetrated with sensitive observation and written in eloquent prose . An exquisite love-story , " The Girl on the Bus , " and a grotesque tragedy , " The Death of Baldy , " are particularly remarkable . Mr. Sansom has exceptional gifts . Miss Gel/horn 's stories deal with the nerve-quivering world of the nineteen-forties . One of them is just over two pages long ; another takes seventy-two pages , without an unnecessary paragraph . Miss Gellhorn 's plots are far bolder than Mr. Sansom 's ; and her special gift is conveying character , both individual and national . She can describe Polish officers with all their gallantry and gusto , without making them sound crazy ; French society ladies , exquisite and brittle ; Germans , brutal and efficient or vague and otherworldly ; Italians , shining surfaces ; and Englishwomen , chilly , selfish , proud , sometimes pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gradual revelation of character in it could only have been managed by a sympathetic and talented writer . Commercial Fiction T HE Literary Guild choice for De-cember , Lincoln McKeever , by Eleazar Lipsky ( Appleton-CenturyCrofts , $3.50 ) , turns out toward the end to be a pretty good story , but it takes so long to get going and it is so clumsily written that many readers will be discouraged . The fundamental conflict is a real one : between the ? Spanish-descended settlers of New Mexico and the incoming " Anglos , " between hot-blooded violence and cold-blooded aggrandizement and the law which tries to deal fairly with both sides . The book begins with a suit and ? ends with a criminal trial : its resolution sound and unexpected . However , it is amateurishly written : it would have benefited from a thorough editing and a careful rewriting . Wisdom T HE , Bollingen Foundation is is- suing the works of the Swiss psychologist Jung , well translated and ( like all their hooks ) printed and bound with real dignity . Several volumes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been passed over because they are forbidding in method ( Psychology and Alchemy ) or technical in vocabulary and approach ( Two Essays in Analytical Psychology ) . But Jung 's Psychological Reflections , edited by Jolande Jacobi ( Bollingen Series 31 , Pan . theon , $4.50 ) , are for everyone interested in the development . of personality , or the life of society , or religion . The extracts are taken from all over his work : some are only single sentences , others arc long complex paragraphs . These selections show something of the universality of Jung 's thinking ! The human being can not live too long in the infantile environment , that is , in the bosom of his family , without serious danger to his psychic health . Life demands from him independence . Too much of the animal disfigures the civilized human being , too much culture makes a sick animal . It would be ludicrous to maintain that man exists in order to breathe air . It is equally ludicrous to say that man exists for the sake of so ciety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the person himself , but observers also , as being dull . . Jung is not only a helper , but a creator . More for the Child-Minded rilliRIEE months ago I reviewed Albert Lynd 's book criticizing the shallow and dangerous principles which are misleading many of those responsible for school education in the United States . The review evoked a shower of letters , some volubly upholding these principles and others bitterly opposed to them . Now three more books on the opposing side have appeared : R. M. Hutchins ' The Conflict in Education in a Democratic Society ( Harper , $2 ) , Paul Woodring 's Let 's Talk Sense about our Schools ( McGraw-Hill , $3.50 ) , and Arthur E. Bestor 's Educational Wastelands ( University of Illinois Press , $3.50 ) . These are all by experienced teachers . Mr. Hutchins ' book suffers from that disdain which prevents him from taking the " educationists " seriously : it is witty It is a curiously ostrich-like way of " meeting life needs " to de-emphasize foreign languages during a period of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when the nation 's security has come to depend on Einstein 's equation : E = me ' .
