About the rarest of current reference books is a gazetteer-the vast descriptive index of towns , cities , counties , countries , mountains , valleys and rivers all over the world . Not since the Lippincott volume of 1905 has the U.S. had a really comprehensive one , and the information in that is obviously long out of date . Last week the Columbia University Press announced that it has something new at last . For $50 , curiosos can now get the fattest U.S. compilation ever-the Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer of the World . <P> It has taken almost six years and $400,000-plus to put it together . Under Editor Leon E. Seltzer , 150 scholars worked in 55 different languages , collecting the latest facts &; figures about 130,000 different places . But the job of making a gazetteer , they learned , is more than just collecting . It also involves disentangling a baffling mishmash of world statistics . <P> Here Today . . . Standard atlases do not even agree on heights of some of the Alpine peaks . Some governments like to pad their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spellings-e.g. , Jebeil , Jubeil , Jebail , Jubayl , Jbail Djebail , Djoubeil . In Russia , a city 's name is apt to change with the size of its population ; in China , it can change with the seasonal movement of a district capital ( e.g. , Shanmulung officially becomes Lungchwan in the winter ; Changfengkai becomes Lungchwan in the summer ) . Islands present a special problem : the South Pacific 's volcanic Fonuafoo , for instance , emerged in 1885 , disappeared in 1894 , reappeared in 1927 , sank in 1949 , will probably come up again soon . <P> To get their figures straight , Seltzer 's gazetteers had to explore far beyond the stacks of the major U.S. libraries . They pored over government manuals , foreign industrial reports , newspapers , schoolbooks and road maps . They wrote to mayors , postmasters , and even to the Dalai Lama . They wrote to every provincial government in China . By the time the Reds took over , most of the replies were in-the most complete collection of data on China available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of their work spread , they got help from unexpected sources . An Indian maharaja sent them scores of volumes about his own state . The Finnish Foreign Minister ordered an official geographer to help them , and Iran 's late Premier Ali Razmara sent them a special survey he had made for the Iranian army . Some countries were not so cooperative , but the gazetteers managed nonetheless . By looking through a recent propaganda tract from Argentina , they found some of the 1947 population figures that Peron had suppressed . By combing through Soviet schoolbooks they learned a thing or two about Russia . Example : the village of Tyuya-Muyun has disappeared from maps , because it has become a uranium-mining center .
