txt Massachusetts faces " the most serious financial problem of the past 20 years and it may be the most difficult to solve of any in the history of our commonwealth , " Representative John J. Toomey ( D ) of Cambridge , chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means , told the Massachusetts House today . The fiscal expert presented to the House a $405,553,661 state budget , trimmed from the $418 , - Beacon Hill Views 254,020 original recommendations of Governor Furcolo . Warning that the state should undertake " a broad reappraisal of our entire system for in another year our fiscal problem may well overwhelm us , " Mr. Toomey explained in detail the financial crisis facing the state . " We are committed , " he said , " to the highest payroll costs in our history , with increment benefits for state employees that annually increase our obligations substantially . Our employee pension plan is far out of balance , with the original concept of 50 per cent participation by employer and employee having entirely disappeared . Coat Spiral Stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that incurred in any previouS decade . The rising cost of living , following the pattern of the inflationary spiral of the past 10 years , has increased the cost of every item in our state budget . " The ways and means chair ' man delivered his statement on the floor of the House as the Democratic leadership oiled up the legislative works to zip through the Democratic - controlled House in one day the Governor 's withholding tax bill and the budget . Mr. Toomey insisted " we must curtail expenditures to the very limit , even to reducing the levels of services to which we have become accustomed . We must secure additional revenue from sources that will not adversely affect the economy of the commonwealth nor bear down unfairly on its citizens . It is impossible to delay an honest balance between revenue and expenditures . . " We must not postpone any longer the elimination of duplication , overlapping of authority , and inefficient use of public fa cilities and services merely to permit departments to continue outmoded services established in another era or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdivisions . " Plans by the Democratic majority to jam both measures through in one day are typical of House action on many major Furcolo measures this year . As a result , big spending bills , or bills involving complicated or controversial policy issues , have been hammered through the House with little or no real scrutiny by the members . Although House passage is expected to be swift , it is anticipated final Senate action will be delayed for some time while the Senate Committee on Ways and Means gives the budget the finetoothed-comb treatment . But most observers expect little in the way of major cuts . As explained by Representative Toomey the $405.553 , - 661 budget is balanced by a 17-million-dollar anticipated windfall from the withholding tax , $5,500,000 from a proposed 1-cent-a-package increase in the cigarette tax , and a $11,433,286 accounts-receivable item from the still-inactivated Massachusetts Port Authority . Furcolo Victory ? Until the port authority is activated the state will not receive the latter money and thus far Furcolo policies have blocked the authority 's active operations . The administration is counting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , originally rejected in the upper branch by a 25-to-15 vote . If the Senate continues to block the withholding tax , budget balancing could be accomplished by agreeing to Governor Furcolo 's proposal to refund 9 million dollars in maturing bonds , slashing the budget , and increasing departmental fees . Originally , Governor Furcolo had proposed the refunding and higher departmental fees to help balance his 418-million-dollar budget recommendations . The cigarette tax measure has been in the Senate Committee on Ways and Means for weeks , after House passage . The Gov- ' governor proposed the higher levy to begin last March 1 . On that he failed . However , it is anticipated the Senate will pass the cigarette tax bill eventually . Furthermore , many observers anticipate Senate passage of the withholding tax despite the previous vote . This anticipation is heightened by the Governor 's success in gaining Senate pas-page of his bill to add six judges to the Superior Court . This victory is taken to mean that the Governor can get through the Republican-controlled Senate bills he really wants passed .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
