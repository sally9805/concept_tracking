After announcing that he would not seek a third term as President , South Korea 's aging Strongman Syngman Rhee was at last persuaded to run " only by the clamor of the Korean people . " He was confident of his popularity and of the efficiency of his machine . Chipper and jaunty at 81 , he spent the final days of the campaign attending the movies and pointing out dirty spots on the new floors of his pet project , Seoul 's plush $5,000,000 Bando Hotel . <P> <P> There was little reason to believe that Rhee would not repeat , or even better , his sweep of previous years . His chief rival , Democratic Party Candidate Patrick Henry Shinicky ( Shin Ikhi ) , had died while campaigning ( TIME , May 14 ) . His only other challenger , ex-Communist Cho Bong Am , had gone into hiding , claiming to have received threats of assassination . Of six candidates for the vice presidency , all had professed support of Rhee except John M. Chang , Shinicky 's running mate . Rhee had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker of the National Assembly . <P> Bamboo Sticks . True , Rhee 's opponents were more vociferous than ever before , and there were anti-Rhee riots in the cities . But that hardly seemed enough to upset Rhee 's well-organized political machine . Anti-Rhee campaigners were harassed by strong-arm squads of government backers . And in towns and villages throughout South Korea , the republic 's 48,000 police openly stumped for Rhee and Lee . What possibly could happen to dim Syngman Rhee 's inevitable victory ? <P> On election day , 94% of the more than 9,000,000 eligible voters trooped to South Korea 's 6,342 polling places to mark their ballots with inked bamboo sticks and drop them into large boxes resembling footlockers . The ballots had been printed before Shinicky 's death , and still bore his name . There were few incidents and no certified cases of interference with the voters . By nightfall , the huge unpainted boxes began to give up their secret . It proved to be a bitter one for Syngman Rhee . In a revolt that spread through cities and villages alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his government a stunning blow . <P> Rhee , of course , was reelected , but by the lowest margin of his career-barely more than half the vote . The late P. H. Shinicky polled an extraordinary ghost vote of nearly 1,500,000 . But the real surprise of the ballot box was the defeat of Rhee 's hand-picked vice presidential candidate by Rhee 's bitter foe , husky , affable , 56-year-old Chang Myun , who anglicizes his name as John M. Chang . A onetime friend of Rhee 's and former Korean Ambassador to Washington , U.S.-educated ( Manhattan College ) Chang thus became eligible to succeed Rhee in the event of his death . While the government and the Democratic Party squabbled over disputed votes , Chang prudently went into " protective " seclusion . Counting of ballots stopped abruptly in Taegu , and Rhee 's opponents charged that he was trying to steal the election .
