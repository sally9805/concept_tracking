North Carolina 's husky , handsome , 54-year-old Congressman Thurmond Chatham is a man who likes people , parties , a well-bottomed drink-and doing what he pleases . He surprised his Yale classmates by passing up officer training courses , enlisting as a seaman in the Navy in World War I. He startled fellow businessmen by expanding instead of contracting the family business ( Chatham blankets ) during the Depression , a gamble which eventually made him a millionaire . During World War II he wangled a demotion-from commander to lieutenant commander-to get into combat on a cruiser in the Southwest Pacific . <P> Glad Shouts . Last week in Germany , Congressman Chatham fell into an adventure which left even his oldest acquaintances breathing a little heavily . One night , as he was seated with a glass of something warming in a West Berlin nightclub , he was spotted by a Russian whom he had known in Washington during World War II . The two men greeted each other with glad shouts , talked for hours , finally went to the Russian 's flat in East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman like to go for a drive in the morning ? The Congressman would . <P> When dawn broke , as Chatham told the story , all sorts of things happened . The Russian hustled into a Red army uniform , set forth with the Congressman to a Soviet car pool , and got a jeep . Having passed through the Iron Curtain , they drove on &; on , mile after mile into Soviet Germany . Brushing past guards , explaining that his companion was an important representative of a satellite nation , the Russian took the Congressman to a newly built airfield , where he proudly pointed out a line of swept-wing jet planes of late design . Then he drove on to an armored infantry compound where he waved a hand " at about 20 new , turretless , heavily gunned Russian tanks which appeared to stand no more than three feet off the ground . Chatham , entering into the spirit of the occasion , gravely got out his camera and took photographs of the Soviet weapons-which he later sent on to Washington . <P> Big Bluff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling a trick on him ? Said Congressman Chatham : " My Russian friend loves America . He wants me to help him get to the U.S. , where he would like to settle down on a farm . " For four years before Korea , his friend told him , Russia had been pulling the biggest bluff in history . In Korea , the Russian officer said , the U.S.S.R. had lost not only face , but great stores of military equipment which it had hoped to use again in Indo-China and Siam . The Kremlin had also made some very bad mistakes in Europe . " Every one-legged German , " said the Russian lugubriously , " would carry a gun against us now . " <P> It was late afternoon before the two friends got back to West Berlin . Gratefully , Congressman Chatham asked if he could do a favor in return . " Yes , " said the Russian , " take me to a PX . " There Chatham loaded his companion down with nylon stockings , cigarettes , three cans of chocolate sirup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bade him goodbye .
