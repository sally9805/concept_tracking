For at least four years , Tennessee 's able Representative Albert Gore has had his eye on the seat of the oldest U.S. Senator ( in years of service ) , doddering , dozing Kenneth D. McKellar . From 1950 on , Gore carefully laid the groundwork by commuting to Tennessee almost every week for " nonpolitical " speeches . After McKellar had announced he would seek a seventh term in the Senate ( which no man has ever had ) , Gore made his own pointed announcement : " I raise but one principal issue : Who is best fitted to serve the state and nation in the U.S. Senate for the next six years ? " <P> " Hoop-dee-Doo . " After his announcement last February , the black-haired young ( 44 ) seventh-term Congressman began stumping the state on an eight-speech-a-day schedule . His " principal issue " was dramatized in a song to the tune of Hoop-dee-doo , which proclaimed : " Go with Gore-Albert Gore . He 's wise and able and he 's just forty-four . . . " Tennessee politicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . <P> This was a new challenge for frock-coated Kenneth McKellar . He has had no serious opposition in his last five elections . In 1940 and 1946 , he did n't even bother to campaign . But now the source of his greatest political power-the well-oiled machine of Memphis Boss E. H. Crump-was still sputtering from the ditching Senator Estes Kefauver and Governor Gordon Browning gave it in 1948 . There was nothing for McKellar to do but go back to Tennessee and show himself to the voters . <P> Last month he flew home , and at Cookeville attracted a crowd of more than 10,000-the biggest political gathering in Tennessee this year . For 51 minutes McKellar clung to a tall table to support himself , and spoke in a surprisingly strong voice . Once he picked up a glass of water , but his hand was shaking so violently that he had to put it down without drinking it . <P> " A Little Rheumatism . " McKellar picked up Gore 's issue : " I have a little rheumatism in my left leg . The truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that I have done more work in the last six months than in any six months of my life . " Then he boasted of his accomplishments at the pork barrel , dwelling on the federal money and projects he has obtained for Tennessee ( e.g. , TVA , Oak Ridge , Great Smoky Mountains Park ) . He promised more : " I would like to stay in the Senate long enough to have a four-lane highway from Bristol to Memphis and three four-lane highways across the middle of the state . " * <P> After Cookeville , McKellar settled down to a hotel-room , handshaking campaign . He tried to be pleasant to the voters , a real effort for a man as crusty as McKellar . His friends tried to give Gore 's issue a full turn . If the old man is defeated , they said , Tennessee will have two " junior " Senators and no influence in Washington . McKellar , who has ruthlessly used his power to fatten his friends and crush his enemies , talked of his appropriations committee as " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that it took him 29 years to become its chairman . This week , as Tennessee Democrats went to vote for McKellar or Gore in their primary ( almost tantamount to election ) , political observers thought rheumatic old " K.D. " had pulled up on Gore , and had made it a neck &; neck race . <P>
