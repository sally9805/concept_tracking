At its annual meeting in Atlantic City , the National Lutheran Council , representing 4,500,000 members in eight church groups , called upon the U.N . General Assembly to request the Arab countries and Israel to meet at a peace table . The council , which re-elected Dr. Oscar A. Benson of Minneapolis president for his second one-year term , also heard a report from its Latin American division calling for a " full-scale spiritual invasion " of the Roman Catholic countries of Latin America . <P> " Religion is gaining ground-morality is losing ground , " said Dr. Henry P. Van Dusen of Union Theological Seminary at an interdenominational seminar . " This is one of the most surprising and overlooked facts in America today . . . Churches possess a larger and wider allegiance . . . than ever before , " but crime , alcoholism , divorce and sexual laxity are on the alarming increase . " Either there will be a moral renewal or religion 's gains will fritter out into futility . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
