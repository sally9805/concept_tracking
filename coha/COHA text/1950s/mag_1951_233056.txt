From West Point to William and Mary , college football had been thrown for a loss even before the season got under way . Last week , while football fans were flocking by the thousands to watch the slightly tarnished Saturday heroes in action , an ex-University of Michigan guard named Allen Jackson brought the ballcarrier down again with a flying tackle . Writing in the current Atlantic Monthly , he gives a firsthand account of his experiences in football 's big leagues . <P> History &; Football . Even as a freshman scrub , writes Jackson , " I was engaged in actual practice on the field for about 20 hours a week during the spring semester , and during the fall my working week was boosted to 28 hours . Of course , this . . . does not include such things as evening movies of the next week 's opponent , study time wasted because of fatigue , extra time demanded by game trips to other schools , and time spent in whirlpools and under heat lamps in the training room . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent about 810 hours in the six history courses he took . His hours on the gridiron : 1,350 . <P> " The student who plays football is expected to sacrifice his studies for the sake of the game , and he is very darkly frowned upon if he misses practice for the sake of his studies . When after one Saturday game I limped off the field with a twisted ankle , I knew that I would be expected to spend a good deal of time in the training room taking treatment for the injury . But since Sunday was the only time that I was able to study for a coming examination , I stayed away . . . As a result , the ankle stiffened and I was made to feel guilty for the rest of the week . . . <P> " Blanket of Blue . " " At Michigan . . . fair play and sportsmanship are fine , but to win is of utmost importance . . . Michigan 's maize and blue players are not encouraged to ' gang tackle ' ; they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket of blue . ' " The slogan of the coaches , says Jackson , is still : " When Michigan loses , someone has to pay . " <P> Jackson also throws a body block at " another bromide " - the myth of " team spirit . . . On the practice field the ends , backs and linemen all spend much of their time in separate corners of the field , performing their various specialties with monotonous repetition . . . Any sport which requires a week 's practice of specialties for each sixty-minute game has become too mechanized to allow the spontaneous sort of team spirit which would seem to be the special value of college football . " <P> Players &; Apes . But the villains of the big time are not only the coaches . There are also the rabid alumni- " the men who are influential in promoting among young boys a distorted idea of what it really means to play big football . . . and who think that other people 's judgments of men are as superficial as their own when they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because everyone is glad to hire a football player .
