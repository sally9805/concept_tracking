The Eisenhower Administration pointed with pride to its original 1958 budget as the third black-ink budget in a row . Then came the Russian Sputniks , signaling the dawn of the space age and stepped-up defense spending . And then came the full force of the recession . <P> Last week Treasury Secretary Robert B. Anderson told of the red-ink results-which spelled out in big figures why the Administration has resisted a deficit-increasing tax cut . Instead of a $1.8 billion surplus for fiscal 1958 , ending June 30 , the Federal Government will run up a deficit of more than $3 billion as it is . Total federal spending will be up from the estimated $71.8 billion to " well over " $73 billion . And revenues will be down from $73.6 billion to about $70 billion . <P> An even gaudier splash of red lies ahead for fiscal 1959 ( TIME , March 24 ) . Only three months ago , President Eisenhower , hopeful that the economy would soon perk up , predicted a skinny 1959 surplus of $500 million . But January 's estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has jumped $4 billion from programs already in the works , to a peacetime peak of $78 billion . <P> And , in what may have been the understatement of the week , Anderson saw a " likelihood " that 1959 income would fall short of January estimates . Privately , Treasury officials consider a shortfall inevitable , guesstimate it at $4 billion or more . Net result : a 1959 deficit of perhaps $8 billion .
