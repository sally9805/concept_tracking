During World War II , Akron 's Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. got plenty of experience operating Government-owned plants . Among them : three synthetic rubber plants , two of which it still runs , and a big aircraft factory which turned out 4,000 Navy Corsair fighters . Last week Goodyear got its biggest Government job : running the Atomic Energy Commission 's $1.2 billion uranium-235 plant in Pike County , Ohio ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) . Though Goodyear had no experience with atomic energy , AEC figured that it did know a lot about the continuous-flow operations used in atomic energy plants , could learn the rest . When the huge , gaseous diffusion plant is completed about four years from now , Goodyear will employ only 4,000 to keep it running , will be paid a cost-plus fixed fee for the job . Meanwhile , Union Carbide &; Carbon , which runs AEC 's Oak Ridge and Paducah uranium plants , will teach Goodyear the ropes .                  @ @ @
