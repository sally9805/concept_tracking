txt The United States now haS a workable jet bomber that will go about twice as fast as the speed of sound . It is nearly twice as fast as bombers in current military operation . Its speed is in the range of some of the fastest fighter planes . The Soviet Union , according to the best-informed Air Force quarters , has nothing like it . The speed of sound is 670 miles an hour at sea level . It decreases with altitude . This plane was designehd to operate at altitudes of ten miles or more . The plane , the B-58 Hustler , was demonstrated publicly for the first time today at the local base of General Dynamics Corporation 's Convair Division , where it has been under development since 1952 . So far , the Air Force has ordered only about seventeen of the planes as a basis for development . The model could get into operational use by 1960 . It is Projected as a successor to the Boeing B-47 medium bomber in current use . Carries S Men and 4 Engines The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of several thousand miles . It gets its speed primarily from two basic design features . One is the bat-like delta wing , named for the triangular Greek letter . This provides exceptional lift and stability . The second feature is the new " pod " concept . In this , the bomb load and some fuel are carried in a big rocket-like container attached under the fuselage . This can be dropped after the plane has reached its target . It eliminates designing into the hull space that is empty half of each trip , and that aerodynamically aggravates the problems of weight and drag . The Hustler over-all is much smaller than the B-47 , and is a midget alongside the Convair B36 and Boeing B-52 heavy bombers . Thus it reverses the design trend toward bigger and bigger war planes . It also reflects the new era of compact atomic weapons , in which bomber weight categories relate to range rather than to load capacity in terms of the old high-explosive bombs . The Hustlers ! cost in quantity is estimated at 35,000,000 . The Hustler is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stands 31 feet high to the top of its tail assembly . The B-36 by contrast is 162 feet long with a wingspan of 230 feet . The B-47 weighs-about 100 tons ; the illus. tler about 80 . The , E-58 was described by Lieut . Gen. C. S. Irvine , Air Force deputy chief of staff in charge of materiel , as " one of the most significant forward steps in the history of military aviation . " In one jump it augments bomber speeds by as much as plane speeds advanced from the time of the Wright brothers to the fastest bomber in use today . General Irvine said the great jump in speed achieved in the plane pointed to the achievement , in the immediate future , of speeds three times as much as sound , at altitudes of fifteen miles or more ; and eventually of manned-plane speeds as much as ten times that of sound . The Hustler is powered by four General Electric J-79 engines , a type used in several previous war plane models . Its navigation and bombing controls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Sperry Company . It is said to have ten times the accuracy of previous equipment with about two-thirds the weight . The three crew members , pilot , navigator and defensive systems operator , sit one behind the other in compartments connect-1 ed by crawl-ways . The demonstration today was largely to display the appearance of the plane and its handling , rather than its speed . Its high-speed runs are restricted to distant , uninhabited areas . Flying at low altitude over Carswell Air Force Base Today , B. A. Erickson , the test pilot , held it below 500 miles an hour . The demonstration was watched by seventy-five reporters flown from both coasts . Much of the plane 's critical performance figures , such as exact speed and range , are still under security wraps . New Fuel to Extend Range On Tpesday the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation announced in Niagara Falls , N. Y. , that it was producing a new fuel , containing boron , that would permit a B-58 to fly to any point in the world and return without refueling.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
