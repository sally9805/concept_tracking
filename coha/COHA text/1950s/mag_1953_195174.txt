Monsoon ( The Film Group ; United Artists ) is a parched little melodrama set in a torrential downpour . An about-to-be-married couple ( Diana Douglas and George Nadar ) arrive at the village of Ginjim in southern India to visit the girl 's family . In Ginjim , the barometer is low and human passions are high . The family 's younger daughter ( Ursula Thiess ) , a child of nature who runs around in scanty outfits , takes the eye of her sister 's fianc . Before long they are cuddling in an abandoned temple , exchanging such lines as : " I will love you with my whole being and forever " and " Half a love is worse than none . " To go with this deluge of dialogue , a monsoon sets in , to the accompaniment of native drums and chants . Filmed entirely on location , Monsoon is notable for a few vividly Technicolored views of the Indian countryside . <P> <P> Invasion , U.S.A. ( Albert Zugsmith-Robert Smith ; Columbia ) is a shoddy little shocker that combines a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Manhattan bar hears the news that the U.S.S.R. is atom-bombing the United States .

" Rehearsals are almost at a standstill because the aggressive authoress ( Margaret Rutherford ) is at loggerheads with the director ( Robert Morley ) , who is at odds with the cast and crew .

Curtain Up has a mildly comic sparkle , but it is often more giddy than witty .
