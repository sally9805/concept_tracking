An enemy answer to Douglas MacArthur 's call for surrender was quickly spotted by a U.N . plane . Winging far up North Korea , a U.S. 5th Air Force fighter-bomber , on a night intruder mission , saw vehicles rolling down from the Manchurian border . They moved in widely spaced clusters , strung over 100 miles of road . Clearly , with supplies from the Chinese and Russian comrades over the border , the enemy was feverishly building up a defense 80 miles north of the 38th parallel . <P> By next dawn a big U.N . aerial hunt was underway . Superforts , Shooting Stars and Mustangs scourged the highways coming down from the north to Pyongyang on the west and Wonsan on the east coast of the peninsula . The enemy 's vehicles moved warily by night , were pulled off the roads and skillfully camouflaged during the day . North of Pyongyang , U.N . planes claimed the destruction in one 24-hour period of 85 trucks carrying tanks and artillery . Rockets and napalm bombs hit supply dumps , barracks and training camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the ground , U.N . divisions regrouped for the imminent push across North Korea . MacArthur blacked out news of the whereabouts of certain U.S. units ; everyone guessed that some were being readied for another amphibious flanking assault along the west coast of Korea . Efficient , sharp-spoken Major General Edward M. Almond , as MacArthur 's chief of staff , had planned the Inchon landing and then led the X Corps ashore to capture Seoul . It seemed a likely bet that Ed Almond and his seasoned men would figure in the next big action . <P> By week 's end the crack U.S. 1st Cavalry Division had crossed the Imjin River , driven back remnants of the enemy 's 9th and 18th Divisions , seized Kaesong , last South Korean city held by the Reds . This week the 1st Cavalry pushed across the parallel in force . They were on the main railway and road to Pyongyang . <P> On the American right flank , four South Korean divisions were well across the parallel , moving up in a looping front from the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Toward Wonsan . Along the east coast road , where harvest-golden paddy fields came down to the sand dunes off the Sea of Japan , the South Korean 3rd Division this week reached Wonsan , where they encountered their first stiff resistance after a march of 100 miles in seven days from the 38th parallel . <P> Towns and villages along the route greeted them with evergreen arches of welcome . Old men puffed long pipes and watched . But young men of military age were noticeably absent . They had been drafted by the Communists for a stand at Wonsan and Pyongyang .
