Into Albany 's high-vaulted Washington Avenue Armory last week streamed 2,000 New York Central Railroad stockholders , primed for the showdown in the long and dirty fight for control of the road . Amid the popping of flashbulbs , President William White strode into the hall . After him came his archrival and pretender to the job of running the Central , Robert R. Young . Both men had come up from Manhattan on a special stockholders ' train , had carefully avoided each other as they and their cohorts went about handshaking , passing out campaign buttons , and politicking for proxies . <P> Promptly at noon White got the meeting under way . The crowd was noisy and restless . Stockholders stood by their seats , clamoring for recognition , or wandered aimlessly around the room . White stuck to his agenda , but soon his chairman 's gavel was drowned out by the hubbub . Finally , he got through the nomination of the two opposing slates for the 15-man board of directors . He announced that the voting would include two resolutions sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Women Shareholders and the holder of ten shares ( plus about 1,000 proxies ) . Then , without waiting for discussion , White declared that the polls were open . <P> Soss for the Gander . Up jumped Mrs. Soss to protest . No ballots should be cast , said she , until there had been full discussion of her proposals ( for cumulative voting and a change in the annual-meeting date ) . After White explained that the polls would be open all afternoon and anyone whose mind was not made up could vote after the discussion , Mrs. Soss shouted : " You 're railroading the vote . . . Maybe we 'll have to have Mr. Young as chairman . " Excitedly , she marched up to the platform , waggled a finger in the faces of Central executives and charged : " This meeting is illegal . " At a nod from White , two railroad policemen jumped over and escorted her back to her seat . <P> By this time the hall was in an uproar , and White pounded in vain to bring back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken were brought in and handed out to stockholders did the meeting quiet down . Looking worn and lonely , White stayed on the platform to eat . <P> " Let Us Take Over . " Young , meanwhile , carefully marked and folded his ballot ( representing his holdings and proxies turned in to him ) and turned it over to the voting tellers at the front of the hall . Another 800,000 shares were voted for Young by Don Carter , representing Texas Oilmen Clint Murchison and Sid Richardson . Shortly after , Young announced to the meeting : " You have won today . . . We have made history . . . The Young-Kirby-Alleghany group has cast a ballot representing a majority of all the outstanding stock . . . On the basis of an 85% to 90% vote , we will have a majority of 700,000 to 1,000,000 shares . " <P> Said White to reporters : " Young 's victory statement is just some more pure bunk . " But Young , unabashed and impatient , pressed on : " If these gentlemen had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our victory now and let us take over the railroad . "
