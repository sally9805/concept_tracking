Otto Dix is a German painter . He likes to growl , " I 'm not so tender . " And in pre-Hitler Germany he showed what he meant : cynical portraits of German prostitutes and socialites , gruesome oils and etchings of World War I. The Nazis did n't like the Dix kind of thing at all ; they considered his powerful paintings deliberately calculated to spread despondency and alarm . They labeled him an " artistic degenerate , " kicked him out of his art professorship at the University of Dresden , and destroyed all the Dix pictures they could lay hands on . Dix retreated to a German village on the shores of Lake Constance and kept on painting . <P> Last week in Munich , Painter Dix 's stubbornness was rewarded by a big retrospective show in honor of his 60th birthday . While the Nazis and World War II had not stopped his painting , they had radically changed its style . Under " permanent observation " by the Nazis , Dix dropped his brutal social criticism and took to noncommittal expressionist landscapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life on Lake Constance " idyllic , probably too idyllic . " <P> The idyl was interrupted for a while in 1944 . At 53 , ex-Soldier Dix was drafted into the Volkssturm for the last-ditch defense of the Reich . But his World War II service was brief and painless . " I was with my squad of ten other men near a little town on the Rhine . We were posted in a field . It was a warm spring afternoon . We all lay down in the grass and went to sleep The next thing we knew , there were some French African troops standing over us with machine guns in their hands . We just did what they told us . " <P> At the French P.W . camp , Dix was told to paint an altarpiece for the camp chapel . The camp commander liked the painting so well that he appropriated it for his private collection , and told the prisoner to paint another for the chapel . Dix became seriously interested in religious art . After he was released , he refused a Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Constance . <P> In last week 's show , critics found his new religious paintings the most impressive . And Dix agrees . Now he confesses : " Even as a young artist I had a longing to paint religious motives , not because I am a religious man but because the motives are so universal . With a Madonna , everybody understands what you 're saying "
