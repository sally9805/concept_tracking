Dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo dramatically put himself on public trial before the world last week . In Washington , Dominican Ambassador Manuel A. de Moya announced that his government was spending $160,000 to hire a public-relations firm and two eminent U.S. lawyers to find out the facts in the case of the disappearance of one of Trujillo 's most impassioned critics , Columbia University Lecturer Jesus de Galindez . Trujillo 's expressed hope : to disprove " fantastic charges " that Dominicans engineered last year 's airplane kidnaping of Galindez from Manhattan , then killed U.S. Pilot Gerald Murphy , who flew the kidnap plane ( TIME , Feb. n et seq . ) . <P> The investigators are dictator-hating New Dealer Morris L. Ernst , who has spent most of his career as a pugnacious battler for civil rights , and Republican William H. Munson , an ex-district attorney and New York State Supreme Court justice . The publicist : Sydney S. Baron , speechwriter for Tammany Boss Carjnine De Sapio . Under the agreement , the lawyers and their crew of private investigators will have free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be free to publish their findings without censorship . " We know of no analogous instance , " said De Moya , " when a sovereign state voluntarily has requested public judgment before the world by citizens of another sovereign state . " <P> Until now , the Dominicans have deliberately hindered the official U.S. investigation , e.g. , they furnished what the FBI called a forged " confession " from the man they said killed Pilot Murphy . The sudden switch appeared to be a belated attempt to end a storm of bad publicity . But , even in the agreement with Ernst &; Co. , there is an escape clause . If the attorneys break the contract " for failure of cooperation , " they will " preserve professional confidence and refrain from issuing any report . "
