SIGMUND FREUD 'S theory and technique of psychoanalysis have profoundly influenced Western man 's thinking about himself . Freud first began . to formulate this theory and develop this technique between 1887 and 1902 , when he was from thirty-one to forty-five years old . After receiving his M.D. from the University of Vienna , he had gone to Paris to study the treatment of hysteria with . Charcot , the great authority of the time . But in 1886 he returned to Vienna to become lecturer on neuropathology at the university and to treat his first cases . His first major work , The Interpretation of Dreams , was published in 1900 . During his critical . period of struggle and discovery , his closest confidant ? and perhaps the closest friend of his life , although the two men eventually quarreled ? was Wilhelm Fliess , a charming , urbane Berlin nose-andthroat specialist and biologist two years younger than Freud whom he met in Vienna in 1887 . Freud was instantly drawn to Fliers ? because of Fliess 's personality and range of interests , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because he , like Freud , was interested in sexuality , though his theory differed widely from Freud 's . . The two men met from time to time in Vienna and occasionally in Berlin , and Freud always referred to these meetings , to which he looked forward eagerly , as " congresses . " Between times they kept up an extensive correspondence which Freud himself asked be destroyed . Apparently he did destroy Fleiss 's letters , but after Fliess 's death , his widow sold Freud 's to a bookseller in Berlin . After a series of adventures during the Nazi regime , the letters turned up in England . Ernest Jones , Freud 's official biographer , has used them and quoted from them in his interpretation of Freud , but large excerpts from the letters themselves are here published for the first time . Anna Freud , Marie Bonaparte , and Ernst Kris have prepared them for publication , and Basic Books , Inc. , will present the 500 pages of the correspondence early in June under the title , The Origins of Psychoanalysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a selection from the letters . In the interest of space , the opening and closing salutations of the individual letters have been cut . While ? the first letters are addressed to " My dear Dr. Fliess " and signed " Dr. Sigmund Freud , " this rapidly gives way to " Dear Wilhelm " from " Sigm. , " and , in the original German , " Sie " is supplanted by " Du . " THE ORIGINS OF Vienna , May 28 , 1888 MY DEAR DR . FLIESS , I have a motive for writing to you , though I might have written to you long ago without one . Here it is : Frau A. , * who since her unmasking as a case of chronic cerebral neurasthenia ( if you will accept the term ) and since her miscarriage , etc. , has made a splendid recovery with a minimum of treatment and is now very well , sees the summer approaching . Her old preferences attract her to Franzensbad , but I recommended a hydropathic cure in the mountains . She asked me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , with every sympathy for you . I thought of somewhere on Lake Lucerne , such as Axenstein . If you agree , will you please jot down the name of a place on a postcard and send it to me by return , and you can rest assured that , whatever place you mention , Frau A. will go to it this summer . But I appeal to you not to pass the decision back to me , because that would not give her any satisfaction , as the magic of your prestige can not be transferred . Please reply by return , because my promise to write to you is already ten days old . . . . Life goes on tolerably well here . When our little Mathilde chuckles we think it the most beautiful thing that could happen to us , and otherwise we are not ambitious and not very industrious .

Wait though ? the first draft of " hysterical paralyses " is finished ? I do not know when the second will be . In short , life goes on , and life is well known to be very difficult and very complicated , and , as we say in Vienna , many roads lead to the Central Cemetery . Vienna , August 29 , 1888 . . . I ADMIT unreservedly that you are right in what you say , and yet I can not do as you suggest . To go into general practice instead of specializing , to use all the resources of general medicine and treat the patient as a whole , is certainly the only way which promises real satisfaction and material success ; but for me it is too late for that now . I have not learned enough for general practice ; there is a gap in my medical equipment which it would be hard to close . I was able to learn just enough to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but time and freedom to catch up . Last winter I was very busy , and that left rue with just enough to live on with my large family , but with no time over for study . During the summer things were very bad ; this left me with leisure enough , but with worries that sapped the inclination . Apart from that , the habit of research , to which I have sacrificed a good deal , dissatisfaction with what the student is offered , the need to go into detail and exercise the critical faculty , is an obstacle to the study of textbooks . II Vienna , April 19 , 1894 AFTER YOUR kind letter I shall not restrain myself and spare you any longer , and I feel I have a right to write to you about my health . . . .

I have only just reached this point , and the misery of abstinence has been unexpectedly great , but that is obvious , after all . . . . Vienna , May 21 , 1894 I AM PRETTY well alone here in tackling the neuroses . They rather regard me as a monomaniac , while I have the distinct feeling that I have touched on one of the ( ) Teat secrets of nature . There is something comic about the incongruity between one 's own and other people 's estimation of one 's work . Look at my book on the diplegias , which I knocked to-gether almost casually , with a minimum of in-terest and effort . It has been a huge suc-cess . . . . But for the really good things , like the " Aphasia , " the " Obsessional Ideas , " which threaten to appear shortly , and the coming aetiology and theory of the neuroses , I can expect no more than a respectable flop . . . . rllt Vienna , June 12 , 1895 . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is going to come off , which would give me great cause for rejoicing . Of course I can not say for certain yet . Saying anything now would be like sending a six-months female embryo to a ball . . . .

I am demanding a great deal of him . Most of the time the burden is superhuman . Bellevue , * August 16 , 1895 .. . MY LITTLE group is very comfortable . here . My wife is naturally not very active , ** but is otherwise cheerful . Not long ago my son Oliver illustrated beautifully his characteristic of concentrating exclusively on what is immediately ahead .

All I was trying to do was to explain defense , but l found myself explaining something from the very heart of nature . I found myself wrestling with the problems of quality , sleep , memory ? in short , the whole of psychology . Now I want to hear no more of it . Vienna , October 8 , 1895 . I AM ENCLOSING all sorts of things you today , including two notebooks mine . . . I wrote them in one breath since my return , and they contain little that will be new to you . I have a third notebook , dealing with the psychopathology of repression , which I am not ready to send you yet , because it only takes the subject to a certain point .

What does not hang together yet is n't the mechanism ? I could be patient about that ? but the explanation of repression , clinical knowledge of which has incidentally made great strides . Note that among other things I suspect the following : that hysteria is conditioned by a primary sexual experience ( before puberty ) accompanied by revulsion and fright ; and that obsessional neurosis is conditioned by the same accompanied by pleasure . But the mechanical explanation is not coming off , and 1 am inclined to listen to the still , small voice which tells me that my explanation will not do . Missing you and your company came on rather late this time , but I felt it acutely . I am alone with my mind , in which so much is stirring , and for the time being stirring itself into a muddle . I am finding out the most interesting things , which I can not talk about and for lack of leisure can not get down on paper . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts and stints inc of the satisfaction of discovery . In short , I am a wretched recluse . . . . Vienna , October 16 , 1895 . . . I AM STILL all at sixes and sevens . I am practically sure I have solved the riddle of hysteria and obsessional neurosis with the formula of infantile sexual shock and sexual pleasure , and I am just as sure that both neuroses are radically curable now ? not just the individual symptoms but the neurotic disposition itself . That gives inc a kind of flat satisfaction ? at having lived some forty years not quite in vain ; but it is not real satisfaction , because the psychological gaps in the new knowledge demand the whole of my interest . I have entirely given up smoking again , so as not to have to reproach myself for my bad pulse , and to be rid of the horrid struggle with the craving for a fourth or fifth cigar ; better to struggle with the craving for the first . Abstinence is probably another thing that is not very conducive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna , October 20. 1895 . . . I WAS OF COURSE tremendously pleased with your opinion of the solution of hysteria and obsessional neurosis . Now listen to this . One strenuous night last week , when I was in the stage of painful discomfort in which my brain works best , the barriers suddenly lifted . the ' veils dropped , and it was possible to see from the details of neurosis all the way to the very conditioning of consciousness . Everything fell into place , the cogs meshed , the thing really seemed to be a machine which in a moment would run of itself . . . . If I had waited a fortnight before setting it all down for you it would have been so much clearer . But it was only in the process of setting it down that I cleared it up for myself .... You will not have any objection to my calling my next son Wilhelm ! If he turns out to be a daughter , she will be called Anna .

As for my own health ( so that I do not forget to mention it and shall not have to mention myself again ) , I have been incomparably better for the last fortnight . I was not able to maintain complete abstinence from smoking , for with my present burden of theoretical and practical worries the increase in psychical hyperaesthesia was insupportable . . . . Vienna , December 3 , 1895 IF IT HAD BEEN a son I should have sent you the news by telegram , as he would have been named after you . But as it is a little girl of the name of Anna , you get the news later . She arrived today at 3:15 during my consulting hours , and seems to be a nice , complete little woman .

I have trouble in fitting everything in , and I can pick and choose and begin to dictate my fees . I. am getting confident in the diagnosis and treatment of the two neuroses , and I think the town is gradually beginning to realize that something is to be had from me . Have I already written and told you that obsessional ideas are invariably self-reproaches , while at the root of hysteria there is always conflict ( sexual pleasure versus an accompanying unpleasure ) ? That is a new formula for expressing the clinical explanation . I have some beautiful mixed cases of the two neuroses at present , and hope to draw closer conclusions from them about the essential mechanisms involved . . . Iv Vienna , ? March 16 , 1896 . . .

IF WE ARE both granted a few more years of quiet work , we shall certainly leave behind something which will justify our existence . That feeling strengthens me against all daily cares and worries . When 1 was young , the only thing I longed for was philosophical knowledge , and now that 1 am going over from medicine to psychology I am in the process of.attaining it . 1 have become a therapist against my will ; I am convinced that , granted certain conditions in the person and the case , I can definitely cure hysteria and obsessional neurosis . . . .

Waiting for news , going to see him , etc. , have been the only things to count in the last fortnight . In the circumstances I can not undertake any plans that involve a day 's journey from Vienna . My father 's a tough fellow , and I hope he may yet be granted a spell of good health ; if so I shall turn it to account for our meeting . . . . . . . THE ow MAN died on the night of the twenty-third , arid we buried him yesterday . He bore himself bravely up to the end , like the remarkable man he was . He must have had meningeal hemorrhage at the last ; there were stuporous attacks and inexplicable temperatures , hyperaesthesia , and muscular spasms , from which he would awake without temperature . The last attack ended with an edema of the lungs , and he had an easy death . It all happened in my critical period , and I am really down over it . . . . Vienna , November 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paper at the moment that I have even put off writing to you to thank you for the moving things you said in your letter . By one of the obscure routes behind the official consciousness , the old man 's death affected me deeply . I valued him highly and understood him very well indeed , and with his peculiar mixture of deep wisdom and imaginative light-heartedness he meant a great deal in my life . By the time he died his life had long been over , hut at a death the whole past stirs within one . I feel now as if I had been torn up by the roots ... . . I recently heard the first reaction to my incursion into psychiatry . " Gruesome , horrible , old wives ' psychiatry " were some of the things that were said . That was Rieger in Wiirzburg . I was extremely amused . And of all things about paranoia , which has become so clear ! I must tell you about a very pretty dream I had on the night after the funeral .. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up saying : 1 recognized the place as the barber 's to which I go every day . On the day of the funeral I was kept waiting , and therefore arrived at the house of mourning rather late . The family were displeased with me , because I had arranged for the funeral to be quiet and simple , which they later agreed was the best thing . They also took my lateness in rather bad part . The phrase on the notice board has a double meaning . It means " one should do one 's duty toward the dead " in two senses ? an apology , as though I had not done my duty and my conduct needed overlooking , and the actual duty itself . The dream was thus an outlet for the feeling of self-reproach which a death generally leaves among the survivors . .. . V January 24 , 1897 . . IN THE EXACTING standards insisted on by hysterics in love , in their humility before the loved one , or in their inability to marry because of unattainable ideals , I recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , the immense elevation from which the father condescends to the child 's level . In paranoia compare the combination of megalomania with the creation of myths about the child 's true parentage . Meanwhile one of the notions that I have been fostering , that the choice of neurosis is determined by its time of origin , is beginning to look shaky ; it seems much more likely that it is determined in infancy . It is still doubtful whether it depends on the time of origin or the time of repression ; ( my present tendency is to believe the latter ) . Being absorbed in all this , I am left cold by the news that the board of professors have proposed my younger colleague in my specialty for the title of professor , thus passing me over , if the news is true . It leaves me quite cold , but perhaps it will hasten my final breach with the university . . . . February 8. 1897 . . . I MUST CORRECT something I recently told you . When I called on Nothnagel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me spontaneously and as a secret for the time being , that he and Krafft-Ebing were going to propose me for a professorship ( with Frankl-Hochwart ) , and he showed me the document , with their signatures . . . . The proposal may have come up at yesterday 's meeting . The pleasing thing about it for me is that I can go on regarding the two men as decent people , because if they had passed me over I should have found it difficult to think well of them . THE ORIGINS OF I have not written anything for a week , because work ( eleven and a half to twelve and a half hours a clay ) has exhausted all my energies . In the evening I drop as if I had been felling timber . My expectations about this season have been confirmed . I now have ten patients under treatment , including one from Budapest ; another is coming from Breslau . Perhaps it is an hour too much , but otherwise it suits me best to have a lot of work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you do not get that for nothing . It must be very difficult to get rich . . . . May 16 , 1897 . No MATTER WHAT I start with , I always find myself back again with the neuroses and the psychical apparatus . It is not because of indifference to personal or other matters that . I never write about anything else . Inside me there is a seething ferment , and I am only waiting for the next surge forward . I can not bring myself to do the provisional summing up of the present position which you want ; I think that what is stopping me is an obscure feeling that very shortly something vital will have to be added . On the other hand I have felt impelled to start writing about dreams , with which I feel on firm ground , and which you feel I ought to write about in any case . I was interrupted straight away by having hurriedly to prepare for the press an abstract of all my publications . The vote is going to take place any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams again . I 'Ve been looking into the literature on the subject , and feel like the Celtic imp : " How glad I am that no man 's eyes have pierced the veil of Puck 's disguise . " No one has the slightest suspicion that dreams are not nonsense but wish-fulfillment . . . A few days after my return a proud ship of mine ran aground . My banker , who had got furthest in his analysis , made off at a critical point , just before he should have produced the final scenes . This has no doubt damaged me materially also , and it has shown me that I do not yet know all the factors that are at work . But , refreshed as I was , I took it in my stride and told myself that obviously I must wait still longer for a complete cure . It must be possible , and it shall be done . .. . May 31 , 1897 I HAVE NOT HEARD from you for a long time . Herewith a few fragments thrown up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for your eyes alone , and hope you will look after them for me . By way of apology or explanation let me add that I know they are only suspicions , but something has come of everything of this kind , and I have only had to withdraw the things I wanted to tack on . Another presentiment tells me , as if I knew already ? though I do not know anything at all ? that I am about to discover the source of morality . . . Otherwise the summer mood is very strong . On Friday we-go to Aussee for Whitsun . I do not know whether I shall have any more ideas worth reporting to you ; I do not want to do any more work . I have laid even dreams aside . Not long ago I dreamt that I was feeling over-affectionately toward Mathilde Freud 's eldest daughter , but her name was " Hella , " and then I saw the word " Hella " in heavy type before me . The solution is that Hella is the name of an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been called Hella because she has been weeping so bitterly recently over the Greek defeats . She has a passion for the mythology of ancient Hellas and naturally regards all Hellenes as heroes . The dream of course fulfills my wish to pin down a father as the originator of neurosis and put an end to my persistent doubts . . . . - VI Aussee , August 14 , 1897 . . AFTER A SPELL of good spirits here I am now having-a fit of gloom . The chief patient I am busy with is myself . My little hysteria , which was much intensified by work , has yielded one stage further . The rest still sticks . That is the first reason for my mood . This analysis is harder than any other . It is also the thing that - paralyzes the power of writing down and communicating what so far I have learned . But I believe it has got to be done and is a necessary stage in my work . Vienna , October 3 , 1897 . . ? OUTWARDLY VERY LiTTLE is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening . For the last four days my self-analysis , which I regard as indispensable for clearing up the whole problem , has been making progress in dreams and yielding the most valuable conclusions and evidence . At certain points I have the impression of having come to the end , and so far I have always known where the next night of dreams would continue . To describe it in writing is more difficult than anything else , and besides it is far ton extensive . I can only say that in my case my father played no active role , though I certainly projected onto him an analogy from myself ; that my " primary originator " ( of neurosis ) was my childhood nurse an ugly , elderly , but clever woman who told me a great deal about God and hell , and gave me a high opinion Of my own capacities ; that later ( between the ages of two and two-and-a-half ) libido toward my mother was aroused : the occasion must have been the journey with her from Leipzig to Vienna , during which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity of seeing her undressed ( you have long since drawn the conclusions from this for your own son , as a remark of yours revealed ) ; and that I welcomed my one-year younger brother ( who died within a few months ) with ill wishes and real infantile jealousy , and ' that his death left the germ of guilt in me .. I have long known that my companion in crime between the ages of one and two was a nephew of mine who is a year older than I am and now lives in Manchester ; he visited us in Vienna when I was fourteen . We seem occasionally to have treated my niece , who was a year younger , shockingly . My nephew and younger brother determined , not only the neurotic side of all my friendships , but also their depth . My anxiety over travel you have seen yourself in full bloom . I still have not got to the scenes which lie at the bottom of all this . . . . I can not give you any idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . The practice is still very bad . I fear that if it gets still worse it may interfere with my self-analysis . My recognition that difficulties of treatment derive from the fact that in the last resort one is laying hare the patient 's evil inclinations , his will to remain ill , is growing stronger and clearer . We shall see . VII October 15 , 1897 MY SELF-ANALYSIS 1S t he most important thing I have in hand , and promises to be of the greatest value to me , when it is finished . When I was in the very midst of it , it suddenly broke down for three days , and I had the feeling of inner binding about which my patients complain much , and I was inconsolable . . I have found love of the mother and jealousy of the father in my own case too , and now believe it to be a general phenomenon of early childhood , even if it does not always occur - so early as in children who have been made hysterics . ( Similarly with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? heroes , founders of religion . ) If that . is the case , the gripping power of Oedipus Rex , in spite of all the rational objections to the inexorable fate that the story presupposes , becomes intelligible , and one can understand why later fate dramas were such failures . Our feelings rise against any arbitrary , individual fate such as shown in the Ahnfrau , * etc. , but the Greek myth seizes on a compulsion which everyone recognizes because he has felt traces of it in himself . Every Member of the audience was once a budding Oedipus in phantasy , and this dream-fulfillment played out in reality causes everyone to recoil in horror , with the full measure of repression which separates his infantile from his present state . The idea has passed through my head that the same thing may lie at the root of Hamlet . I am not thinking of Shakespeare 's conscious intentions , but supposing rather that he was impelled to write it by a real event because his own unconscious understood that of his hero . How can one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doth make cowards of us all , " and his hesitation to avenge his father by killing his uncle , when he himself so casually sends his courtiers to their death and despatches Laertes so quickly ? How better than by the torment roused in him by the obscure memory that he himself had meditated the same deed against his father because of passion for his mother ? " use every man after his dessert , and who should ' scape whipping ? " His conscience is his unconscious feeling of guilt . And are not his sexual coldness * The title of a play by Grillparzer. when talking to Ophelia , his rejection of the instinct to beget children , and finally his . transference of the deed from his father to Ophelia , typically hysterical ? And does he not finally succeed , in just the same remarkable way as my hysterics do , in bringing down his punishment on himself and suffering the same fate as his father , being poisoned by the same rival ? My interest has been so exclusively concentrated on the analysis that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether , instead of my hypothesis that repression always proceeds from the female side and is directed against the male , the converse may hold good , as you suggested . But some time I shall tackle it . . Vienna , October 27 , 1897 ... 1 HAVE NOTHING to tell you except about my analysis , which I think will be the most interesting thing about me for you too . Business is hopelessly bad , it is so in general , right up to the very top of the tree , so I am living only for " inner " work . . . I am beginning . to perceive big , general framework factors ( as I should like to call them ) which determine development , and other minor factors which fill in the picture and vary according to individual experiences . Simultaneously a number of my doubts about the interpretation of the neurosis , if not yet all of them , are being resolved . An idea about resistance has enabled me to put back on the rails all the cases of mine which looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now going on satisfactorily again . Resistance , Which is in the last resort the thing that stands in the way of the work , is nothing but the child 's character , its degenerative character , which has , or would have , developed as a consequence of those experiences which one finds in conscious form in so-called degenerate cases ; in these cases , however , the degenerative character is overlaid by the development of repression . In my work 1 dig it out , it rebels , and the patient , who started by being so civilized and well-mannered , becomes vulgar , untruthful , or defiant , a malingerer , until I tell him so , and thus make him able to overcome this degenerative character . Resistance has thus become an objectively tangible thing for me , and I only wish that I had also grasped what lies behind repression . . . . October 31 , 1897 . . . MY OWN ANALYSIS is going on , and it remains my chief interest . Everything is still dark , including even the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassuring feeling that one has only to put one 's hand ir , one 's own store-cupboard to be able to extract ? in its own good time ? what one needs . The most disagreeable thing about it is one 's moods , which often completely hide reality from one . Also sexual excitation is of no more use to a person like me . But I am still cheerful with it all . Do you think that children 's talk in their sleep belongs to their dreams ? If so , I can introduce you to the very latest wish-dream . Little Anna , aged one-and-a-half , had to fast for a day at Aussee , because she had been sick in the morning , which was attributed to eating strawberries . During the night she called out a whole menu in her sleep : " Strawberries , wild strawberries , eggs , omblet , pudden ! " I may perhaps already have told you this .
