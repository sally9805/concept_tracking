SIR WALTER SCOTT , HIS LIFE &; PERSONALITY ( 295 pp. ) - Hesketh Pearson-Harper ( $4 ) . <P> ALEXANDRE DUMAS , A GREAT LIFE IN BRIEF ( 198 pp. ) - Andr Maurois-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> The two writers were as different as Scotch and Burgundy . Sir Walter Scott ( 1771-1832 ) was a gentleman genius who practically invented the historical novel , and wrote out of rich learning in Scotland 's romantic past ; Alexandre Dumas ( 1802-1870 ) was a brilliant upstart who wrote with " the overflow of a gush of personality , " and used the help of educated men to do the research for many of his best stories . Scott was lamed by a child hood attack of polio and was ill for much of his life ; Dumas was in overpowering good health and spirits all his days . But both men were master storytellers , both made - and lost - fortunes at their trade , both turned out such mountains of work as to make the most diligent modern writers seem sluggards by comparison . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first mass reading public - a public that was created with the rise of the middle class , when literature ceased being mostly a fixture of the countryhouse and the coffeehouse , and was taken up by the new masters of the countinghouse . In his excellent new study , Biographer Hesketh Pearson ( G.B.S. , Dickens , Oscar Wilde ) calls Scott " the first of the best-selling novelists . " In his artful little life of the elder Dumas , Biog rapher Andr Maurois ( Proust , Disraeli , Voltaire ) says : " Better than any other novelist , Dumas knew how to share and satisfy the passions of the masses . " <P> The Clansman . Trained in the law but bored by it , Scott led a bluff and loyal clansman 's life in George III 's Scotland and collected the Border ballads he loved . At 33 he published his own ballad . The Lay of the Last Minstrel , and it sold an unheard-of 40,000 copies . After such narrative poems as Marmion and The Lady of the Lake ( which started a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scott started turning out his medieval romances and his beloved tales of bygone borderers and buccaneers . <P> Benevolent and good-humored , Scott was a tradition-loving Tory who , says Biographer Pearson , " thought nothing of his fame as a writer compared with his place as . . . clansman of Buccleuch . " He tossed off such novels as Ivanhoe and Rob Roy without revising or even rereading , dictating at times while racked by pain from gallstones and stomach cramps . He was extravagant : his " hut " at Abbotsford became a castle , where he spent immense sums buying up land , planting trees ( 3,000 laburnums , 3,000 Scotch elms , 100,000 birches ) and entertaining noblemen , statesmen , lairds and literary lights . <P> At the high noon of his fame , Scott 's badly managed ventures in printing and publishing failed . Debts of 130,000 were charged against him . Refusing bankruptcy , Scott said : " I will not yield without a fight for it . " Through the last six years of his life , he fought by writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years turned over 40,000 to his creditors . He kept on writing bestsellers until his frail health finally cracked and he died at 61 ; later the sale of his works settled the last of the debts that helped kill him .
