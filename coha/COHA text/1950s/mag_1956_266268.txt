As long ago as George Washington 's time , slaves were subjected to tooth pulling so that their masters could get a replacement for a missing tooth . Now Dentist Ernest M. Pafford of Phoenix , Ariz , has carried the idea to its technological conclusion : wisdom teeth and a few front teeth extracted from patients needing whole dentures are tagged for blood type and Rh factor , then preserved indefinitely in a deep-frozen tooth bank . When a tooth is transplanted , it is first held in place by a blood clot in a carefully made socket in the recipient 's jaw . Discomfort usually passes off in about 18 hours , and the tooth 's tiny blood vessels establish links with the circulation in its new mouth . It can never ache in the ordinary sense , because there is no nerve connection . After about two weeks it is embedded firmly enough to be used for chewing steak .
