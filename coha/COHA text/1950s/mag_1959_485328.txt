The economic relationship between white-ruled South Africa and U.S. financial interests has quietly undergone a dramatic shift this year . It is a development certain to overshadow in significance the more-publicized Kissinger diplomatic moves in the region . At a time of unprecedented political turmoil in South Africa , major U.S. financial institutions have moved in with more than $700 million to shore up the hard-pressed Pretoria regime . The biggest U.S , banks have organized and participated in a number of multimillion-dollar loans to the South African governments , state-owned corporations and private projects . As a result , U.S. indirect investment ? ( mostly bank loans ) in South Africa has for the first time in history surpassed the direct stake held there by some 300 American corporations . The latest major credit agreement was signed in Reed Kramer is on the staff of Africa News Service and has written extensively on U.S. interests in southern Africa . late October  --  a $110 million loan to the government from a syndicate led by Citibank and co-managed by Morgan Guaranty Trust . Total lending to South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 billion  --  nearly double what it was one year ago . By comparison , direct U.S. investment , which totals about . $1.6 billion , has slowed its headlong rush of recent years , and may even show a decline for 1976 . According to sources in Wall Street and South Africa , the banks and the government negotiated for more than two months before concluding the recent credit pact , which the white regime desperately needs to offset a trade deficit that may exceed $2 billion this year . ( Last year 's $1.7 billion deficit was a record . ) South Africa is borrowing heavily to finance massive development projects and boost its defense spending . The result has been inflation at home  --  about 20 per cent for key consumer goods  --  which has wiped out most of the benefits black workers have won in recent pay hikes . Late last year , the government had to devalue its currency 18 per cent , but many experts say it is still overvalued . The real growth rate , which topped 7 . per cent in 1974 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a further decline in 1976 . The government budgeted and planned on the assumption that the price of gold would remain between $150 and $200 per ounce , but it fell to $104 in August and has recently been running about $130 . Income from this number-one export earner will fall far short of what is needed . Some of the huge new prOjects may have to be delayed or scrapped , but defense expenditures will certainly continue to rise . With falling gold prices and heightened black resistance , Pretoria is under tremendous pressure . It is hard to imagine where it would be right now without borrowed funds . Last year , , according to available data , South Africa obtained $550 million in Eurocurrency loans and $185 million through Eurobonds . ( The Euromarket is made up of major currencies which are on deposit outside their home countries . ) In just one transaction last April  --  a " gold swap " with Swiss banks ? Pretoria borrowed more than $500 million . South Africa has also borrowed at least $200 million directly from British and French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Monetary Fund in two separate transactions has loaned the government $357 million in recent months . South Africa 's biggest borrowers are the government and the state-owned enterprises . This year for the first time , the public sector is accounting for more of total capital inflow than the private sector  --  a trend that makes South Africa more dependent than it ever was on Western financial interests  --  and is costing more money . South Africa is paying between 1.5 and 2 per cent above the London Interbank Offer Rate ( Libor ) for its loans , while many other countries are raising substantial capital at Libor-plus-1 per cent or less . No longer can South Africa negotiate ten-year loans , as it did even . last year . And payments on the medium-term credits it is now receiving begin in six to eighteen months . Most loans carry one-year renewal clauses that allow the lenders to get out with little penalty . Even medium-term credits are becoming hard to find . The government asked Citibank for $300 million , but the participating banks cut that in half and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending ceiling for - South Africa went down recently , " according to one expert . " They wo n't get any more major loans here for several months , " says a New York bank official ; " they are trying to find the rest of the $300 million in Europe . " But according to the Agefi International Bondletter , the door of the Euromarket is nearly closed to South Africa . Another indication of South Africa 's credit problems is the recent U.S. ' Export-Import Bank decision to pull : out of a $2 billion , coal gasification project , SASOL II , which is to be built by the California-based Fluor Corporation . Ex-Im originally planned to provide at least $200 million in loan guarantees  --  a briefing paper defending the decision had been written to meet Congressional criticism  --  but the board suddenly reversed itself in June , after South African police killed hundreds of student demonstrators in Soweto . Dillon Read , the New York investment banking company , which has been hired to find financing for SASOL II now has a tough job on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' indefinitely . The SASOL II refusal was Pretoria 's second disappointment at Ex-Im this year . Fluor and the construction lobby began pressing the White House late last year to lift the ban on direct Ex-Im loans to South Africa . They argued that SASOL II contracts would create jobs and boost earnings here , and they got twenty-one Senators to co-sign an appeal to President Ford . But the National Security Council concluded that foreign policy interests are being served by the loan restriction . Only the Pentagon , which favors military cooperation with South Africa , and the Energy Research and Development Administration  --  which is ? interested in the coal gasification technology and in uranium , endorsed an end to the ban in the NSC study . Direct loans with Ex-Im guarantees are made , however , by the Private Export Funding Corporation . PEFCO , capitalized by some sixty American banks and financial institutions , " was set up to take risks where commercial markets leave off , " according to Ex-Im Vice President Stephen Minikes . " Obviously South Africa is such a situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to South Africa represents 10 per cent of its total lending worldwide . American regional banks , which when they entered - the competition for foreign business in the early 1970s became an important source of credit for South Africa , have more recently grown " gun shy . " In June , Foskor ( the state-owned Phosphate Development Corporation ) tried to raise a $30 million loan from U.S. regionals , but according to the Johannesburg Financial Mail was finally forced to turn to the country 's " traditional friends , " the New York banks . In 1973 , the National Council of Churches obtained and released secret bank documents which disclosed a series of loans to South Africa worth $210 million . They were organized by the New York-based European American Banking Corporation and involved ten smaller U.S. institutions . Public disclosure of the loans led to protests , and church officials say nine of the participating American regionals have pledged to make no further loans to South Africa . The churches and the Americhn Committee on Africa are planning similar protests against the recent loans . Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but the stakes are high . The spectacle Of . South Africa raising record kians here in the midst of the most serious political challenge ever mounted against its white ' minority rule demonstrates the importance U.S , business interests place on that nation . " South Africa is endowed with all the minerals needed by the industrial world , except petroleum and bauxite , " says a recent Chase Manhattan analysis : " It produces 77 per cent of the non-Socialist world 's gold , 75 per cent of its platinum , and major shares of diamonds , uranium , manganese , chromium and antimony . " It also produces unusually high : profits for investors , South , Africa forms the hub of a strategic , mineral-rich subcontinental economy  --  still highly interdependent despite recent political changes  --  where more than $5 billion in Western capital is committed . ? However , the loans and other investments can not be regarded as a carte-blanche endorsement of ' white supremacy . The bankers would like to see a moderation of racial practices ? " the development of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President George Vojta put it during Congressional testimony in September . But until a suitable alternative takes shape , they seem willing to help the white regime survive . ' ' - " The banks are ' too sophisticated to pull the rug out from underneath South Africa , " says The Economist of London . " Their line is that its ' mineral resources make the country a good bet in the long term whatever the political changes . " Back in 1974 , those minerals attracted the special attention of the Nixon administration , at a time when it was avoiding as best it could any policy toward Africa . On Presidential orders , the White House Council on International Economic Policy studied U.S. mineral dependence and reported that South Africa is not only a major supplier of strategic materials but also a dependable one ? " unlikely to participate in any embargo of exports . " What did concern the analysts who wrote the report was how disruptive for Western economies political turmoil in southern Africa could be . Their discussion of this ' sensitive topic remains classified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mention it . Those considerations were a major reason why Sec-retary of State Kissinger began to take so lively an interest in southern Africa 's problems , when it became clear to all that white rule in the region can not survive for long . Along with his visible diplomatic undertakings , Kissinger has quietly sought to , rally the financial community behind his attempt to slow the pace of change from minority to majority rule . The American Secretary has held personal consultations with top American bankers and with South AfriCa 's most powerful financier , Harry Oppenheimer of Anglo American Corporation . American political and economic . involvement in southern Africa today amounts to a new kind of interventionist strategy  --  one relying more heavily on financial capital than on covert agents to influence Political developments . For Rhodesia , it includes a $2 billion trust fund designed to preserve the present economic infra- , structure by encouraging the whites who control it to remain in the country after independence . It includes : major new investments there ; the State Department has begun laying the groundwork with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It includes strategic allocation of American aid money and personnel : the Agency for International Development ( AID ) has commissioned one study on how funds : should be allocated to the transitional administrations-to-be ' in Rhodesia and Namibia , and a second , more compre7 hensive study is being made of the eco-political frame- , work in nine southern African nations . For South Africa , informed diplomats believe , it includes an American proposal to Prime Minister Vorster , designed to nudge him into concessions over Rhodesia and Namibia by offering assistance to obtain new invest7 ment and loan capital from private enterprise and the IMF . In contrast to several . other Kissinger ventures , the latest southern African undertaking has attracted bipartisan support . The momentum it has gained  --  and the subtlety it employs  --  could carry this strategy right into Democratic policies . In any case , U.S. businessmen have been quick to recognize how well it serves their interests . " Particularly at a time when the recent U.S. diplonciatic initiative in southern Africa gives rise to strong hopes for peaceful change in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonwhites , " says Morgan Guaranty Trust Vice Chairman Lewis Preston , " we believe it important to assist , through loans such as this one , in maintaining the economic stability and momentum without which this process of change would be , at the very least , seriously impeded . " Preston 's comments are contained in a reply to questions asked about the bank 's participation in a recent $200 milliOn South African loan by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility . According to Tim Smith , director of the Center , sponsored by fifty Protestant and Catholic bodies , those arguments have not convinced the churches to drop their criticism . " These loans , " he says , " directly support the apartheid government financially and politically , and they come at a time when ' the black population is in open rebellion against the white minority ' regime .
