Not since its music critic called Liberace a " butcher " musician and " Chic Sale " humorist did the San Francisco Examiner get as many irate letters on a single subject . Other papers across the U.S. have had the same experience . " People jumped into this thing with both feet , " says Managing Editor Frank Angelo of the Detroit Free Press Reason for all the fuss was a syndicated version of Rudolf Flesch 's best-selling ( over 60,000 copies since March ) Why Johnny Ca n't Read . Said one school official in St. Louis after the Globe-Democrat started its series : " I 've never seen a book more discussed than this one . My phone practically rang itself off the wall . <P> In a sweeping condemnation , Flesch had accused the schools of an almost total failure to teach children to read because they had abandoned phonics ( the letter-by-letter , syllable-by-syllable method ) in favor of sight recognition ( recognizing whole words by their appearance ) . " Do you know , " wrote Flesch , " that the teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the United States switched to the present method around about 1925 ? " Bald and exaggerated as his statements were , Flesch had in a sense done the nation a favor . He had brought the extremists out into the open , and he had forced the educators to explain just why they teach as they do . <P> Bowl to Pot . Though it may vary somewhat from city to city , the method now used in most schools is a combination of systems . The educators admit that word recognitlon has its dangers . It is quite possible , as one Louisville mother reported of her son , for a third grader to type out b-o-w-l and call it pot , or for a pupil to develop the annoying habit of putting the President in the White Horse or assembling stamp collisions . But phonics alone can be equally disastrous . Though a pupil might be able to read the word institute right off , says Elementary Education Supervisor Mary O'Rourke of Massachusetts , he can without other training be completely confused as to its meaning . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two people do n't know each other , you institute them . " <P> After years of research , the educators are now agreed that phonics is wrong for beginners . " When I was in school , " says ames E Greene , professor of education the University of Georgia , " I spent days learning the letters of the alphabet and a lot of meaningless syllables like AA , BB and AB . What the hell did I care for AB ? The whole idea is not to drill the pupil in abstract symbols at first but to bring about what the educators call " reading readiness . " <P> Bear to Pear . In determining a child 's readiness to read , the teacher must make sure not only of his eye , but also of his ear . Thus , the pupil may be given a series of pictures and asked to circle the object that the teacher names . If he mistakes a comb for a cone or a bear for a pear , he is obviously on his way to mistaking " institute for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher may try to put across certain abstract concepts . A pupil will be asked to draw a ball beside , under or above another object ; or , he may have to mark which line in a series is the longest . If he ca n't yet make such distinctions , he is not ready for the written word
