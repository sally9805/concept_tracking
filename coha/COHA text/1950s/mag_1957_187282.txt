Copper and Brass ( music and lyrics by David Baker and David Craig ; book by Mr. Craig and Ellen Violett ) is mostly lead . A musical in which Nancy Walker plays a bonehead lady cop would seem like a pretty good idea , and it is-on the few occasions when Nancv is left to her own expression-changing , body-twisting devices . But there are many occasions when she must wrestle with other people 's dialogue and lyrics and tunes , and the even grimmer occasions when she is not even around . Then darkness descends and somnolence mounts . <P> As one of New York 's finest , Comedienne Walker handsomely snarls up traffic in the Holland Tunnel . As a plainclothes operative , she runs amuck in a fur piece and lassos a man trying to bring the fur to heel . As a private citizen she turns into a sort of basket case in a wildly modern chair . But these brief skylarkings and a Bob Fosse dance number and William and Jean Eckart 's crisp sets complete the roll of honor . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a police-shoes lightness and charm . There is not even the sense that something went wrong with the show ; there was never anything to go wrong with it .
