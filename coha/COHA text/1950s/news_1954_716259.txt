txt The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America , C. I. 0. , announced today that it was worth more than $250,000,000 . The union 's resources , which were reported by Jacob S. Po-* tofsky , president , at the opening session of the Amalgamated 's fortieth anniversary convention here , make it one of the wealthiest labor groups in the world and rank it among the country 's most richly endowed financial institutions . Mr. Potofsky reminded 1,500 impressed delegates and 200 clothing manufacturers , who were the union 's guests , that the Amalgamated had not always known such material plenty . " We were a penniless , obscure organization forty years ago , " he said . " We had to borrow money to furnish our . first offices , composed of three rooms in Union Square in New York City . " Today the union controls eight insurance funds and two insurance companies ( all self-managed ) , with reserves of more than $108,000,000 ; two banks worth more than ** housing developments valued at more than $23,000,000 . Among them the international union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Canada have assets in the neighborhood of $23,000,000 . Another $6,000,000 to $10,000,000 is invested in buildings , health centers and other properties , bringing the Amalgamated 's total worth to well over $250.000.000 . In fact , some sources believe the figure may be nearer to $300 , 000,000 . Two years ago , the last time a comparable estimate was made , the figure was $200,000,000 . Like any responsible organiza- tion with large amounts of money on its hands , the union pursues a cautious and conservative investment policy . Of the total assets of the international  --  figured at over $8,000,000 ? more than $5,249,000 has been put into United States Government securities and $680,000 in Dominion of Canada bonds . Likewise the cradle-to-grave insurance program of the union is administered with a careful regard to security . The enormous reserves are invested in United States bonds only . Speculative investments are not countenanced . " We are not fussy , " Mr. Potofsky said . " We think that nothing but United States Government bonds are good enough for our funds . " Aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $1,200,000 in the last two years on contributions to health drives and institutions , campaigns for the general welfare , educational activities and support of union members . Several large gifts were made to aid rehabilitation and development projects overseas , particularly in Israel and Italy . Mr. Potofsky reported that since 1952 the union had chartered four new joint boards and forty-five new local unions and had added 15,000 new members in 100 plants in all parts of the country . The Amalgamated 's to . tal membership , he said , has now reached a record high of 385,000 . The keynote address contained also a slashing attack on the Eisenhower Administration and Congress for " failing the American people in the most crucial areas of the general welfare " and on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , Republican of Wisconsin , for attempting to destroy civil liberties and civil rights . " The present big-business Administration has much to answer for the , growth of McCarthyism , " Mr. Potofsky asserted . " And the most pernicious aspect of that is that McCarthy was encouraged because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . That a major political party should descend to this level is a matter of deep shame . " The union president charged that Senator McCarthy Lad " done more for the Communists than they could ever de for themselves in this country . " Further , he declared that McCarthyism was " an attack on the American tradition of liberalism and fair play just as communism attacks this tradition from another direction . " Mr. Potofsky urged the election , next fall of candidates " dedicated to the economy of abundance , who believe in labor 's right to organize and bargain collectively , who are pledged to civil liberties and who will put this country back on the track to fullproduction , full employment , prosperity and peace . " He singled out for specific personal mention tint following Democratic Senators running for reelection : Paul Douglas of Illinois , Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota , Estes Kefauver of Tennessee and James Murray of Montana . In addition he called for the election of former Vice President Alben Barkley , who is a candidate for the Senate from ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was having a study made of the state 's Public Utility Disputes Act , which forbids stoppages in utility industries . He described . the law as " faulty " and said it might even be " unconstitutional " because of its " dictatorial method of compulsory arbitration . " Msgr.George G. Higgins of the National Catholic Welfare Council also addressed the convention , which will continue through Friday .
