LADY BULLFIGHTER ( 209 pp. ) - Patricia McCormick-Henry Holt ( $3.95 ) . <P> Every time the vicious young bull charged , the tall , blonde girl from Texas spun him past her high-waisted Andalusian pants with a flick of the crimson muleta . When finally she leaned over the bull 's lowered horns and killed him , the crowd at the Ciudad Jurez ring went crazy over Pat McCormick , the U.S. 's first professional woman bullfighter . As she paraded around the arena with the bull 's two ears that the admiring judge had awarded her , a fan called : " If you could only cook . " <P> It is an accepted fact of 20th century life that an American girl can do anything she wants to , and this story records how Pat McCormick , the pretty art student from El Paso 's Western College , wanted to make a career of bullfighting , and did . Though far from Hemingway 's or Barnaby Conrad 's bullfight Baedekers , this ingratiatingly modest account of a girl 's apprenticeship in one of man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ever knew about the art of the corrida . <P> After her sensational Ciudad Jurez debut in 1952 , Pat joined the bullfighters ' union as a matador de novillos ( apprentice fighter of bulls five years old or less ) , and became the union 's first woman member since the memorable Peruvian Conchita Cintron , who quit the bull ring for matrimony in 1950 . In the next two years , she killed 80 bulls in Mexico 's smaller rings . As soon as her technique matched her courage , said her trainer , she could move on to fight in the big ring of Mexico City . But those goals seem further away now than when Pat wrote about them . Last month , fighting a thousand-pounder at Villa Acuna , Torero , McCormick suffered her third and most serious goring . Recuperating at her parents ' home in Big Spring , Texas , Pat vows she will fight again as soon as the doctors let her-probably next year .                  @ @ @
