" Look , " said a U.N . correspondent , pointing from the window of a press train in Korea one day last week , " here comes our domesticated Communist . " Out of a jeep , wearing a trim Eisenhower jacket , climbed burly Jakov Levi , 30 , foreign editor of Belgrade 's Borba , and first Red newsman accredited to the U.N . forces . <P> Levi , who formerly covered U.N . sessions at Lake Success , will spend a month with U.N . troops in Korea , a month in Japan and a third month touring southeast Asia . He is mailing his copy home because Borba ca n't spare dollars for cables . <P> At Panmunjom , U.N . correspondents flocked eagerly around to watch Titoist Levi meet the Red reporters covering the truce talks . The Reds eyed Levi coldly . Said Chu Chi Ping , a Chinese reporter , to Americans : " I enjoy talking to you . I know who you are and where you stand . But this man is neither fish nor fowl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Tito , the Yugoslav retorted : " Where was Hungarian Deputy Premier Rakosi when our peoples were fighting for their liberation ? In a hotel in Russia eating caviar , while Tito was fighting in the mountains . " Sputtered Merai : " You call yourself a Communist . . . " <P> Later , a correspondent remarked to Levi : " They called you a fascist . That 's almost as bad as being a capitalist , is n't it ? " Replied Levi : " Yes , almost . "
