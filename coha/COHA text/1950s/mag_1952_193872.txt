Some 70 years ago , a reform-minded general named Arabi Pasha led his brother officers in overthrowing a corrupt Egyptian government . After a sharp look at the crusading officers , England 's great colonizer , Lord Milner , wrote : " It is possible to approve their aims and yet to disbelieve entirely in their capacity to carry them out . " Eight months after he took power , Arabi fell , unable to control the forces he had unleashed . <P> Now a new reforming general , Mohammed Naguib , is in power . How is he doing ? In three weeks he has become Egypt 's Indispensable man . Rarely in history has so much power been won with so little effort . Starting out to purge Egypt 's army , Naguib became Egypt 's ruler ; vowing a distaste for politics , he has become through default his country 's leading politician . Last week the reluctant ruler had the enthusiastic sanction of the people and the press , the anxious respect of the politicians , and the hopeful if sluggish attention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a good job : changed the laws to encourage foreign capital ; refused to reconvene the Parliament , which the corrupt Wafd Party dominates ; freed the press , abolished censorship , the secret police and titles of nobility . He has vowed to limit the size of landholdings and to attack " indirect taxes whose burdens fall on the poor . " <P> " Now We Warn .

But Naguib did notice , snapped : " I am not satisfied . " This week he added : " We have advised . Now we warn . Next we shall act . We have had enough of corruption .

" Speaking to foreign correspondents , he asked military aid " from the United States , Britain or any other Western democratic state , " added : " But will I get it ? " <P> Last week , a high-ranking U.S. observer in Cairo cracked a smile for the first time in months as he summed up : " We 're sold on Naguib . He 's almost too good to be true . But , " he added , " the men around him have us worried . " <P> The Surrounding Hawks . Hovering around Naguib at every press conference , watching him , watching the reporters , and watching each other like hawks are three or four tough , determined-looking young officers . They do not hesitate to cut Naguib off in mid-sentence to whisper advice , at times even take over touchy questions and answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After one such passage last week , a reporter asked : " Is that what you think too , General ?
