FLOOD INSURANCE <P> As eight Atlantic states staggered out from the most costly floods in U.S. history last week , underwriters reported that insurance will cover only 5 to 10% of losses totaling $1.6 billion . Worst hit were railroads , industrial plants , cities and houses , most of which were massively insured against every disaster but the one that struck . " There just is n't any flood insurance available . " lamented a spokesman for the New Haven railroad , whose $10 million losses were among the ravaged area 's heaviest . <P> Why is flood insurance so hard to get ? Insurance companies fear that in major floods they could not begin to meet the claims for damage to real property , e.g. , buildings and machinery , which are most susceptible to water damage . Insurers believe that they can economically cover only property which can be moved out of the flood 's path . Thus , in the Northeast , the companies ' heaviest payments will be for wrecked or damaged cars , boats , and goods in transit . The small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect for damage to belongings . <P> On the other hand , many policyholders who assumed that they were at least partly protected are in for a disappointment . For example , some businessmen whose plants were wrecked or halted by the flood , hoped to be reimbursed for loss of income under business interruption policies . But most of these policies specifically exclude interruptions caused by flood. * <P> The principal economic argument against flood insurance is the nature of the risk . The most destructive ( average yearly toll : some $420 million ) and widespread calamities in the U.S. , floods tend to haunt the same areas , e.g .. the Missouri and the Mississippi river basins , which had floods costing more than $1.5 billion from 1936 through 1951 . Said one insurance executive : " Potentially , every insurance company could be bankrupted by one casualty . " <P> If flood insurance were available , only the worst risks-those who are most exposed to floods-would buy it . Since the market would thus in all probability be limited to less than 10% of all property owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , if floods were included like hailstorms as a standard risk in all extended-coverage policies , and the cost were spread among all property-owners , premiums would be many times the cost of present insurance . The man who lived on a hill would be subsidizing the riverbank dweller . <P> Even if flood insurance were feasible , argue insurance men , the company that offered it as a standard risk ( necessarily at a higher premium ) would lose business to competitors who preferred to keep their feet dry . Concluded a Manhattan insurance executive : " The Bible tells you to build your house on a rock . I guess you 'd better be sure the rock is a high one . " <P> <P> Public demand for flood insurance quickly crests and drops off , most companies find . " Wait six months , " said a Boston insurance man .
