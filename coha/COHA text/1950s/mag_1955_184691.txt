Convicted in federal court six months ago on criminal charges of " monopolizing . . . the dissemination of news and advertising " in the Kansas City area ( TIME , March 7 ) , the Kansas City Star last week got its punishment . Federal Judge Richard M. Duncan fined the paper $5,000 and also fined Advertising Director Emil A. Sees $2,500 for attempting to monopolize . A companion civil suit , still pending , seeks to force the Star Co. to divorce its radio-TV station , WDAF , from its newspapers and to split up the evening Star and its morning sister , the Times , into two separate papers as far as circulation and ad rates are concerned . Said Star President Roy Roberts : " Of course the Star and Mr. Sees will promptly appeal , in full confidence of the ultimate outcome . "
