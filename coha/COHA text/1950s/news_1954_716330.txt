txt President Eisenhower said today that the threat of communism was world-wide and truly serious , and that it could not be checked by armed strength alone . What he fears more than anything else at this time , the President said at his news conference , is a failure in the West to see the problem as a whole and a disposition to concentrate attention on a single threatened area such as Indochina . It is not enough to be militarily strong , he said . The free nations must be strong , too , in the realm of the spirit and the intellect , - in the economic sphere and in purpose , the President asserted , for the Communist attack is on a broad front . The Communist menace may face the free world for forty years , and the United States needs a defense program it can afford to carry for a long time , the President said . A White House aide , when asked about the President 's fortyyear estimate on East-West friction , said he believed the President merely was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time . In Geneva , Britain warned the Communists that negotiations might be broken off unless they make possible " without further delay " an agreement on three major issues concerning Indochina . In a Reflective Mood The President was in a regective mood this morning , giving long answers to several questions . He apologized at one stage for appearing to make a speech as he outlined his thoughts on the problems of peace and war . On these points he was more specific : 9The military situation of the French Union forces in the Tonkin delta , in Indochina , is possibly better than it was at the time of the battle for Dienbienphu. - The French command is better able to concentrate its forces for quick relief of threatened areas . There is no question that the French could use more outside help to improve their situation . 9His military budget is sufficient to deal with the present danger . This does not mean he is completely satisfied with it . He will admit he is wrong and change the budget if that becomes necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States budget and policy planning up to the present . There is no purpose in using up resources merely to win some local battle without having laid the proper political and psychological basis for action . qAs of this moment , he has no plan to ask Congressional standby authority for action in Indochina in the event that such ac , ton becomes necessary while the House and Senate are in adjournment . The matter will have to be put up to Congress in any case , but not now . 9The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 should be relaxed to allow a freer interchange of weapons information with allied nations , The United States can not ask for cooperation from its allies and at the same time sit back and refuse them information of the most vital =sequence , if war should come . 9A way must be found for going ahead with the United States plan for an international atomic ' pool , dedicated to peaceful uses , despite the Soviet Union 's rejection . The power of atomic energy . should not be sequestered in , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wider public understanding of the benefits it promises to all mankind would strengthen the moral forces favoring peace and general disarmament . A reporter prompted the President 's philosophic discourse by asking whether he agreed with the recent statement of Admiral Robert B. Carney , Chief of Naval Operations , that the dangers the United States had faced in the past were trivial compared with the danger of today . The President said he tried to avoid such comparisons , but agreed that the free world , inescapably , was in a serious situation . The countries behind the Iron Curtain , while united by the threat of a knife in the back , have the choice of objectives and the power to launch a sudden attack , he said . As a result , the free world has to be strong everywhere . The best policy for the United States is to have a mobile strategic reserve in a central place ready for action whenever its vital interests are threatened , he added . But it is dangerous to concern ourselves only with the military threat , the President said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East , or Europe . The broader challenge of communism embraces the mind , the spirit and the Material world , the President said . He said he was puzzled by its appeal to some well-educated Americans , whom he did not name . He was unable to understand , the President added , how intelligent men could espouse and support Comrannist doctrine when its application in Russia and elsewhere meant the use of force , indifference to the individual and his condition , bribery , deceit , corruption and fear . To counter the /On control of the Communist world the free nations have to form a like unity through cooperation , he said , and through strength in their beliefs , as in the certain knowledge that theirs is the better system . At this point the President said he was sorry he had made a speech but the question was too broad and too complicated for exact definition . To another question , on the adequacy of his military budget , Mr. Eisenhower said he did not mean that . it was sufficient for starting a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget , he replied that there had been no change for the moment . He went on to re-emphasize his belief that military strength alone was not the answer . It would be perfectly useless and costly , he said , to go wage a battle somewhere without the proper psychological and political basis for such action . The President compared the ' position of the free world with that of the French Union forces in Indochina . Even as the Com-1 munists are strong in arms and able to choose their objective for sudden attack , so the Vietminh ' has the initiative against the French Command , he said . The French are trying to hold a large area against an elusive enemy who can choose the time ' and place for attack , the President said . Until the battle for Dienbienphu , he added , there were no large concentrations of Vietminh forces against which the French could mass their strength . Now , in the delta fighting , the French have a smaller area to defend and are able to concentrate mobile detachments for swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that extent their situation has possibly improved , the President asserted .
