Basketball loves headlines , but last week it got a bellyful of the wrong kind . Gamblers had tried , and failed , to fix a big-time college game in Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden . As the fixers ' trail unraveled , it led straight back to last year in the Garden , when the gamblers had tried and , it seemed , succeeded very well . <P> The hero of the story was Junius Kellogg , 23 , a Negro , sophomore center on this year 's Manhattan College team . Gamblers had approached him ( as the team 's high scorer ) , offered him $1,000 , he said , to make sure that Manhattan lost last week 's game to De Paul University by ten points or more ( basketball gamblers bet on point margins , not just results ) . <P> Junius was shaken , said no . What shook him particularly was that the man who put the deal up to him was Henry Poppe ( Manhattan ' 50 ) , one of the co-captains of last year 's team . Junius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities who summoned the police . <P> Following instructions , Junius talked to Old Grad Poppe again . Poppe told Junius what to do against De Paul : miss baskets , slow down the game , " but do n't stink it up . " Junius was too jittery to play very long . Manhattan Coach Ken Norton had to take him out . But his substitute had a great night , sank eight baskets in eight tries . To the distress of gamblers betting on a sure thing , Manhattan upset De Paul , 62-59 . <P> The gamblers ' distress was just beginning . Later the same night , the police picked up Old Grad Poppe . The story that Poppe told stole the basketball headlines last week : Co-Captain Poppe , working with his teammate , Co-Captain John A. Byrnes , had helped to throw three Manhattan games last year ( against Bradley , Siena , and Santa Clara ) ; each co-captain had collected $5,000 for his cooperation , plus a $40-a-week salary . <P> Arrested along with Poppe and Byrnes were two bookmaking brothers , Irving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sing Sing ' 37 ) , and the man police named as the go-between , Cornelius Kelleher , of no known alma mater . <P> The new scandal was the third in six years , all three tied up with games in Madison Square Garden. * <P> <P> *The others : a plot ( that failed ) to have Brooklyn College lose to Akron ( TIME , Feb. 12 , 1945 ) ; a plot ( that failed ) to have George Washington lose to Manhattan ( TIME , Jan. 17 , 1949 ) .
