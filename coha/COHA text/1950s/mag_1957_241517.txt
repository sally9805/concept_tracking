By contrast with its staid morning sister , the 76-year-old Los Angeles Times ( circ. 462,257 ) , Norman Chandler 's eight-year-old Los Angeles Mirror-News ( 308,594 ) is liberal Republican in outlook , breezy in style-and heavily in the red . Last week Chandler announced the " resignation " of the Mirror-News 's independent-minded Editor-Publisher Virgil Pinkley , 50 , onetime vice president and European manager of the United Press . Pinkley 's successor : Hugh A. ( " Bud " ) Lewis , longtime city editor of the Times . His probable first step : to attune the Mirror-News 's editorial policy more closely to the Times , dropping such Ike-chiding editorial-page features as Columnist Marquis Childs , Cartoonist Herblock.
