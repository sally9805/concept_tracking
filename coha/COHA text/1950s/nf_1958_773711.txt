txt // of Kant 's remarks , who have taken a priori to mean independent of all experience . This concept of category , if adhered to , requires us to entertain a very narrow definition of experience , one quite dif-ferent , certainly , from our identification of experience with consciousness . But it also leads to wonderment as to exactly what the referent for any such category would be . For awareness of categories is a fact in our experience , and the application of categories to any realm of experience is a further experience . To what , then , does a category refer beyond all experience ? Other philosophers have argued the innateness of the categories . But there is no reason for supposing that any innate tendency is necessarily endowed with logical validity or necessity . It is obvi-ously true that the mind is innately endowed with the power of developing all the ideas , true or false , which it does develop . But what is important for the categories is not the psychobiological problem of innateness . It is simply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are numerous ) hold that all analytic propositions are indeed a priori , but that they are mere tautologies . But all of these views of categories do less than justice to the combined logical-empirical given in ? 8 . A category derives its validity not from any supposed independence of experience , nor from its imputed innateness , nor from its being discoverable by analysis . A true category is indeed independent of particular ex-periences taken separately , but it can not be relevant and be inde-pendent of what we find in experience . To be sure , the power to know categories may be innate ? for it is in men , but not in frogs or stones . And a category can be known only by one who analyzes . But these facts are irrelevant to the a priori validity of a category . A category is a priori relative to , that is , necessary to , some whole ( or realm , or system ) of experience or universe of discourse . The searcher for categories who would be empirical must first declare what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is talking about . Wherever else his study leads him , all his claims of a priori necessity for his categories are relative to that area or realm . Hence , all categories must rest on a basis at once synthetic and analytic , empirical and tautological , if you please . But the theory of categories becomes pure romantic dogmatism if made exclusively synoptic and empty tautology if made purely analytic . Empirical coherence , synoptic-analytic method " ? these are the source and // basis of the validity of the categories . It is these that Kant was reaching for in his derivation of categories as postulates of New-tonian physics and in his distinction between the real and the imag-inary hundred thalers . It is these that Hegel implied in his principle that the true is the whole . A category is what is essential to an empirical whole . 10 . CATEGORIES AS EMPIRICAL It may seem superfluous at this stage of the argument to make a separate issue of the proposition that categories are empirical . But in view of the state of contemporary thought and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is necessary to dwell on this point . For some , like Hume and the logical positivists , only that is em-pirical which appears as sensory experience . For others , 12 only what can be observed and tested under laboratory conditions is empirical . For still others , only what is open to public inspection13 is truly empirical . Are not all these theories simply honorific titles given to pre-ferred selections from the actual shining present ? Why is any one process in consciousness ? sensory or scientific , public or private ? any more conscious or less conscious than another ? Is a laboratory a holy of holies where alone experience is glimpsed ? Why is one experience any more or less empirical than another ? It is necessary to plead , in these times , for the democracy of all experience and for the duty of one who avows an empirical standpoint to take into account all experience and not merely some specially prized part or aspect , Does not the very nature of philosophy command inclusive consideration of every available fact ? And where are any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is both precious and imperious , A theory of categories , then , is necessarily based on experience ; if true , it is applicable to experience . No categories are of any meta-physical interest without specification of the realm of experience from which they are derived and to which they apply . In the light of such considerations , it can be seen that space is a category of the spatial realm only and that oughtness , or a moral imperative , may // well have , as Kant thought , a kind of primacy over all other categories ? especially if all experience is personal and if thinking is itself a moral obligation.14 In any case , categories are derived from some or from all experience , and their a priority is based on their relevance and applicability to experience . Whether or not they are eternal truths is dependent on whether experience is , in any sense , eternal . If there were no experience but logic , neither space nor time nor cause nor any category except logic could be deduced . If there were experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning could be found . But experience is actual and is potentially rational . Therefore categories may be found and metaphysics is possible . The thinker , to be sure , must be cautious . But excess of caution is an even more paralyzing foe to truth than an excess of speculation . This may be illustrated by a quotation from the great S. Alexander : " Postulates are to be regarded in metaphysics with the utmost suspicion , and no postulate is needed for what experience , which is our only ultimate test , asserts . " 15 Had Alexander adhered to this cautious maxim , he would never have written his Gifford Lectures ; he would never have postulated Space-Time as his evolutionary ultimate , and , in our terms , he would have remained forever a solipsist of the present moment . He was overcautiously exaggerating the truth of the shining present , and ascetically denying himself the right to any realism or any illuminating absent . In fact , he was suppressing the presence in experience of reason itself and of the nisus toward totality which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postulates and categories is indeed a peril , but refusal to seek for any categories is a far greater intellectual peril . It is at bottom a denial of the relevance of reasoning to experience . 11 . CLASSIFICATION OF CATEGORIES The historical survey ( ? 2- ? 7 above ) is sufficient , on the one hand , to establish the genuineness of the problem of categories , and , on the other , to render the investigator cautious about setting up arbitrarily any system of categories so perfectly ordered as to be " prolegomena to any future metaphysic . " The very fact that categories are relative to universes of discourse must always leave open the possibility that some new realm of being may be disclosed of which nothing is now known . To debar new light from new experi- // ence is unjustified either on subjective or on objective grounds . All that is said about metaphysics is said subject to correction by new experience or better reasoning . The same is obviously true of the sciences . Any a priori classification of categories will be avoided here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminating absent , as known to us , however , one very general initial classification is sug-gested . Categories may be tentatively divided into those that apply to all possible realms of being , whether " present " or " absent " ? " experienced " or " believed-in " ? and those that apply only to some limited or specific realm . A preliminary discussion of some such classification will occur in the following section , which will then be followed by more extensive analysis in chapters following . 12 . CATEGORIES OF ALL POSSIBLE REALMS OF BEING First of all , then , we have to ask whether there are categories of all possible realms of being ; and we note , with empirical caution , that " possible " is used here in the sense of experienceable , think-able , or imaginable in view of experience . Philosophy can not deal with that to which experience offers no clue . 12a . Time . The most pervasive aspect of experience is time , and it is proposed as the most fundamental category of all possible being . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a succession , a memory of a past , an expectation or planning of a future . That it is a category of the shining present can not well be doubted . Were time to be erased , experience would be destroyed . Is time also a category of all possible illuminating absents ? Its relevance to physical and biological realms is beyond dispute . There are , however , many who have spoken of timeless realms ? realms of ideal truth , such as the logical and the mathematical , or Platonic Forms which define the universal truth of courage or temperance , justice or the Good . Disregarding ( as too easy a proof of temporal-ism ) the modern view that there are no eternal truths , let us ask what would become of eternal truths if time were denied . If we assert that the category of time does not apply to the eternal Good , can we mean that the eternal and the temporal are completely irrelevant to each other ? If so , it would seem that a being in time could not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be // meant by timeless or eternal truth ? Surely , not that a timeless truth is irrelevant to time or that it can not be known under the category of time . There remains an alternative view which is compatible with all the facts of experience . It is that by eternal truth is meant omni-temporal truth . In fact , any truth , no matter what its temporal reference may be , is true whenever it is uttered , provided it is cor-rectly defined ? it being obvious that such words as " now , " " tomor-row , " " the past , " or " very soon , " need painfully exact definition . An eternal truth , in the more exalted sense , is one that is omnitemporal both in the sense that it is true at all times and that it is true of all times . It is a truth that as I write these words it is approaching five minutes of ten by my watch ; but , although this proposition will be true whenever its truth is known , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one specific time on one specific day in 1952 . But if it is true that I ought to love my neighbor , that truth is true of all times . There is no time when I ought to deny it ; it is always true , whether it is in my shining present at a given moment or in the illuminating absent . So-called timeless truths , if such exist , are timeful rather than timeless . They are not irrelevant to time ; they are relevant to all times . Time remains a category of all possible realms of being . If one asserts that anything is completely irrelevant to time , then that irrelevance obtains at all times . Thus time creeps slyly into every attempt to deny its universality . 12b . Change and identity . The very structure of time experience generates , or at least strongly suggests , a pair of related categories , namely , change and identity . The experience of time is an experi-ence of change ; and if the only change that can be detected is a change in the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To live , to be a person , to be a cause or an effect , to be a process , to be a force , to act ? all these are names for changes . If Leibniz 's esse est agere , " to be is to act , " 17 is a truth , then to be is to change . Every new act changes the universe , however much it may resemble previous acts . But that there is " resemblance " must never be forgotten . Were lawless , chaotic change the only fact , nothing resembling the shin-ing present with its degree of rational unity could ever arise . Change presupposes not merely resemblance but also identity . There is no change unless something changes . There is no law of change unless there is something identical in the changes . Hume could not speak of impressions , James could not speak of a stream of // consciousness , no one could make a promise or appeal either to fact or to reason unless there were some identity both in the changing speaker and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union of change and identity , time itself could not be , and present-past-future would be meaningless words . Whoever we are and whatever we are talking about , time and change-identity are categories of all our worlds . 12c . Actuality-potentiality . Consulting again the category of time , we find involved in the time experience another pair of categories , namely , actuality and potentiality . To be in a shining present is to be actual . To be ( truly ) in an illuminating absent is in some sense temporal , for every present and every absent points to a future . Every present of every kind is therefore the potentiality of a future . If there were nothing actual , there would be nothing potential . ' $ On the other hand , everything actual is also a potential , whether the actual be physical or psychological . Actual disaster has often emerged from fantastic imagination ; and great truths have emerged from wild guesses . The very nature of all being is to be the potency of something more . But there is a limit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the structure of the actual . The category of actuality-potentiality was fundamental for the whole metaphysics of Aristotle , although curiously he did not view it as a category . ( He might have found it in the moods of the verb ! ) It was essential , also , to Hegel and to Whitehead . It must be basic for any philosophy that takes time , or purpose , or freedom , or evolu-tion seriously . Everything that is , both is , and is a promise of some-thing more . ' 9 13 . CATEGORIES OF SPECIFIC REALMS Some categories are initially applicable to specific and limited realms of being , but not to all possible realms . There is a reason for qualifying this statement by the adverb " initially . " Among the most important problems of metaphysics is that of how categories which // are not at the start obviously " generic " or universal for all realms are in fact interrelated . Among the categories which seem initially to be applicable only to restricted realms of being are space , obliga-tion , value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously to be a category of the orders of being described by geometry and by physics . The physical order requires a further category , motion , which is a synthesis of time and space and thus has a more derivative character than most categories . Value and obligation . In what may be called the moral order at least two categories have been discovered ? the category of value and the category of obligation . Value designates the fact that moral choice presupposes an end to be chosen which is desired or ought to be desired.20 Obligation designates the irreducible ex-perience of duty ? the fact that a moral person " ought " to choose the best possible value . Without value and obligation there could not be a moral order . But it seems at first glance to be true that without value or obligation there would be space . In my experience , I could renounce any value and disregard any obligation ; but I could not renounce space . It would be there willy-nilly . Ultimately , obligation may also be there , whether I accept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less obvious than that of space . Be that as it may , space and obligation seem to be relatively independent of each other , as motion , for example , is not independent of space ( and time ) . The metaphysician is on the lookout both for differences and for resemblances . Above all , he wants to see both differences and re-semblances in a common , that is , an all-including , perspective . Value and obligation are certainly categories of moral experience . To stop there , content with the pluralistic chant , " Each fact is each fact is each fact , " is to be too smug to satisfy the metaphysical con-science . Yet the pressing problem of the interrelations of the categories ? especially of obligation and value to the other categories ? must be shelved for the time being . It will appear again when the fuller discussion of personality is in order . We turn now to a pre-liminary consideration of personal identity as a category . Personal identity . There is an experience so essential to all other experience that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a category of all possible realms of being . But such a temptation must be resolutely resisted , because it is neither convincing nor // rational to trust any intuition as being a universal truth until it has been subjected to the most rigorous tests . The experience to which these words allude is that of personal identity . Change and identity have been named as correlative categories of all possible realms of being . Everything changeless is related to change ; everything changing changes only by virtue of its relation to something identical . In logical identity as experienced in all thought about all being , these correlated categories are exemplified , for logical identity is discovered and functions only in a context of difference or change . Actual experience is never wholly identical or wholly changing . But the very structure of the shining present reveals an instance of change and identity which is more than logical . It is both generic and specific . It is both logical and psycho-logical . It is both phenomenal and ontological.21 It is the categorical property of the shining present to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal identity as a category is meant : ( a ) That all actual experience occurs as a complex unity of consciousness ? a " time-span " ? which is properly called mine.22 ( b ) That every present personal identity stands in a unique relation to certain now past experiences which once were shining presents . That relation is a complex one , combining memory ( usually in the form of mem-ory linkages ) 23 with the experience of self-identification . The cate-gorical essence of memory is not repetition or recollection , but recognition or acknowledgment , that is , the remembered experience is recognized and acknowledged as mine ? my achievement , my failure , my hope deferred , my promise . " This experience of personal identity is a category because the denial of it would deny the fact of experienced unity in the shining present and would destroy the meaning of all memory and all pur-pose . Without the categorical affirmation of personal identity , the shining present would be reduced to a durationless vanishing point ? to nothing at all . Without it , history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments could ever be performed ; no meaning could be assigned to symbols and no logical reasoning carried out ; no verifications of any kind could be defined or effected . Personal identity is the necessary presupposition of every possible process in every possible shining present . Yet , again , it must be remembered that this of itself does not yet justify the conclusion that personal identity is a category of all possible being . It is possible that somewhere in the illuminating absent there lurks unexperienced and impersonal being . But so far as all shining presents go ? all directly experienced being ? it is personal in the sense defined . And it must be noted that the presence of an anthropomorphic physiological organism is no more relevant to the definition of this experienced personal identity than apples are essential to Newton 's law of falling bodies . Personal identity is the generic presupposition of there being any shining present at all , and , a fortiori , of any perceptions or reasonings in it , whether about apples or the human organism , or the subconscious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of cause , is of central concern to Plato , Aristotle , = Leibniz , Berkeley , Hume , Kant , Schopenhauer , Bowne , and Whitehead , for example . It has assumed many forms in the history of thought . That history has sufficiently proved its categorial nature by showing that without acknowledgment of cause science , metaphysics , moral responsibility , and communication among minds are all impossible . Cause , in some sense or senses , is a category . But in what sense ? There are two main senses in which cause has been regarded as a category . They have been called the phenomenal ( Plato , Kant , Bowne ) and the metaphysical or ontological ( Bowne , Whitehead ) . Phenomenal cause has been conceived as the uniformity of order or sequence even when this uniformity is couched in different language : shadows on the wall of Plato 's cave , Hume 's " custom , " Kant 's and Bowne 's phenomenal cause , Whitehead 's presentational immediacy , or the verifications of logical positivists . Today sequence is stressed less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " power " ( Locke ) . It is conceived as activity and interaction by Berkeley , Leibniz , Kant ( reciprocity ) , Whitehead ( causal efficacy ) , Bowne , and Sellars . It is often conceived as akin to the experience of volition ( Berkeley , Leibniz , Schopenhauer , Bowne , Royce ) . And it is fundamental to // purpose , in the thought of Aristotle ( " Nature does nothing in vain " ) , the " volitionalists " ( except Schopenhauer ) , and of White-head ( subjective aim ) . Metaphysical cause is also thought of as creativity ( Bergson , Whitehead ) or emergence ( Lloyd Morgan , S. Alexander ) . How these various conceptions are to be validated and interrelated , perhaps under some more unified concept , will be left to the further development of the thought of this book . Here no more is attempted than to show that cause is a category and also that it has complex applications . 13e . Communication . A further category , communication , is closely related to both personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a synthesis of personal identity and cause . Again , it may be viewed as the category of all possible societies . That we have experience which we take to be communications or messages , direct or indirect , from some mind or minds not our own ? this is a fact that shines in every present . The category of personal identity forbids that the mind of the sender be the same mind as the mind of the receiver . The very nature of com-munication requires the " withness " of at least two minds if communication is to mean more than introspective staring at one 's own consciousness . Communica-tion , then , presupposes nonidentical persons in an interpersonal relation . " E It might be called the interpersonal category were it not that the communication more clearly raises the interpersonal rela-tion above the level of mere interaction . The experience from which this category is derived is most inter-esting . Communication varies widely in degree of directness or immediacy . Conversation is an obvious example of more direct communication . Another such example is wordless understanding based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirect communication is involved in all thinking which employs language or symbols not wholly invented by the thinker , in all memory and all feeling aroused or affected by others . In fact , it would be very difficult to specify any moment in any shining present which is not to some extent , directly or indirectly , an experience of interpersonal communication . Are you alone in a room ? Your very feeling of " no one there " is an interpersonal experience . Does some one enter ? Even if you know not who , your whole shining present // shines differently because a thou is there . Indeed , are you ever truly alone anywhere ? The category of communication pervades all privacy . Yet , and here is the rub , it is not easy to see how any experiences of any identical self can be known to be communications from others . The presence of the other , as a conscious , thinking , feeling person , can never be verified in me unless you and I are the same person . If we are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the rainbow has vanished ; we have destroyed the very minimum precondition of communication ? of love or hate , of cooperation or worship ? namely two persons . The wretched sur-rogate for verification given by positivists in the form of sensory experiences or " the physicalistic language " is certainly neither what we mean by other mind nor , by itself , proof of other mind . Unless I assume the category of communication , I have no reason for sup-posing that my sensory experience means anything to you or that you can understand my physicalistic language any better than you can understand Choctaw . No sensory experience or sensory language affords the slightest verification of anything except its presence in experience . No wonder that positivists despair of metaphysics ! Yet how could they reasonably despair of metaphysics when they formed the Wiener Kreis , a group for philosophical discussion among minds seeking truth . The Kreis is no Kreis without communication , and communication is a metaphysical category . Just why is it metaphysical ? Negatively , because a pretended communication whose referent or thou is within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is solipsistic trickery , imagination , dream , introspection . It is not society . Positively , because each communicator is a self-identical person who can be known to the other only by rational faith.28 To put it in what is now familiar language to readers of this book , other minds are always situations-believed-in . They are , in the literal sense , absent from my shining present . But since my shining present is not a mere pile of intuition-bubbles , or senses impressions ( as Hume thought it was ) , but is rather a living whole , potentially rational , I am warranted in trust-ing what brings order and meaning into my shining present ( in this instance , the existence of other minds ) . Communication , the most antipositivistic of all categories , is nevertheless one of the most trustworthy precisely because of its rational metaphysical basis . For if communication is not acknowl- // edged as a category of all shining presents , and if its affirmation of illuminating absents which communicate with my shining present is not literally true , then there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical discussion , in any socially directed questions or in any answers . What my private shining present , taken as bare immediacy , can not give me , what positivistic theory can not give me , is required by my shining present taken as a process of rational mediation . 13f . Substance . This preliminary sketch of sample categories would be incomplete if the category of substance-attribute were omitted . For Aristotle , with his subject-predicate thinking , substance was basic . Where would language be without substantives and adjectives ? To the brilliant and critical mind of St. Thomas Aquinas , Aristotle 's arguments were persuasive , and substance was the fundamental category for him . It has a most formidable , a most substantial sound . First of all , let us ask what those who use this category are seeking . Substance is the symbol of permanence in change ? it is the identical in the category-pair of change and identity . The demand that something be permanent in the processes of change was put squarely before the intellectual world by Plato in his assertion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we think when we think rationally , not what we opine when we opine arbitrarily or what we see when we look at changing sense data . There must be something permanent at work in the world or else there would be no order and chaos would reign . Again , the permanent must be the potency and promise of change . Unless there were something permanent in the orders of being which can be relied on to produce sunshine and harvest , springtime and winter , motion and life , these phenomena would never occur . Substance is therefore needed both as a ground of permanence and a ground of change . Further , the Aristotelian tradition has refused to find substance in experience . Substance is literally that which takes its stance in a subway below experience . For this demand , an empirical idealist can find some rational basis . After all , the shining present can not be wholly self-generating . If categories like metaphysical cause or communication are truly categories , then no human shining present is self-sufficient . Its being is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Whitehead to the contrary notwithstanding ) except in the relative sense of its free decisions in the face of given alternatives . The shining present participates in its own creation , // but it is no wholly independent entity . It depends not only on its own past , but also on the interactions and communications that continually alter it , as well as on the causal power that brings it into being initially and conserves its continued being . Something , then , that meets the need for permanence and power must be conceived . Substance has been supposed to be necessary to perform this two-fold function . Nevertheless , the major tendency of modern philosophy has been to do away with substance in the Aristotelian sense . The Conti-nental rationalists and the British empiricists both had their troubles with it . The rationalists , starting with Descartes , had really three types of substance : thinking things , extended things , and God . Spinoza was troubled by the pluralism and reduced all to one sub-stance , God or Nature . Leibniz was troubled by the singularism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The empiricists , starting with Locke , felt a vague need for substance , but Locke could not find it in experience ( although he found personal identity ) and he was reduced to a je ne sais quoi when he tried to tell what this unexperienceable permanent power is . Berkeley not only rejected material substance , but affirmed that spirit consisted of experienced activity which affords all the permanence and all the power that experience can offer or reason require . Hume abolished active spirit and left , or meant to leave , no trace of substance ; yet he ascribed permanence to impressions and power to " unknown causes " and thus , he too was haunted by the ghost of substance . " From Kant on , insofar as metaphysical thinkers have been alert to their task , they have been seeking for clues in the shining present which could suggest the union of permanence and power without a return to the essentially unverifiable and abstract substance of Aristotelian-scholastic philosophy . This book is not a history , and it is not our task to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Amer-ican neorealists , for example , were powerful in their attack on sub-stance , but failed in their constructive substitute . They wrongly found reason to consist wholly in analysis-synthesis , and they ex-plained away or ignored synoptic experience of wholes . Therefore they reduced all being to the results of analysis ? unanalyzable simples ( and their relations ) . These simples or neutral entities en-joyed unchanging permanence , to be sure , and were discovered by analysis of experience . But neutral entities lacked power , activity , // purpose , and any principle of wholeness , and they therefore could not do what substances were needed for . It is a central thesis of this book that the functions of substance ? permanence and power ? can not rationally be ascribed to any sort of supposed being ( suppositum ! ) which can not be found in any shining present . Rather is substance to be rationally ascribed to the person , as defined in the category of personal identity . Is this not permanence enough ? In the shining present is the power of choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potency mean empirically ? We shall entertain the hypothesis that all illuminating absents are communicating persons or experiences of persons30 and the further hypothesis that the order and interactions of persons is explicable only by reference to a Supreme Person . This hypothesis is the basis of the " scheme of ideas " embodied in the present meta-physics . The hypothesis has at least the initial merit of transcend-ing the shining present by a system of illuminating absents without appealing to any kind of supposition foreign to all experience . It suffers from the initial defect of being rather out of fashion . Neither the merit nor the defect shall keep us from further evaluating its place among metaphysical hypotheses . Chapter 7 TIME 1 . THE RELATION OF TIME , SPACE , AND MOTION Time , space , and motion are such closely related categories that they might best be discussed together . But for reasons which will appear , this chapter will be devoted to time and the next to space and motion . As we shall see , time is the more fundamental or pervasive of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are no logical relations between time and space , save those of noncontradiction and consistency . The experience of the passage of time while one is struggling in his shining present with some problem of personal or social morality , or with some mathematical or metaphysical problem , could be completely analyzed without any reference to the concomitant spatial experiences of bodily behavior or of desk and muchmaligned armchair . In short , it makes no difference where one thinks , as long as one can think . But thinking always takes time . Space can not be logically deduced from , or discovered by , analysis of time experience . Nor can time be discovered by an analysis of space . It is quite possible to prove the Pythagorean theorem without punching a time clock or discovering in the proof any reference to time . Why , then , is it said that time and space are related categories ? Some awareness of time shines always in the present ? some sense of enduring , some reminiscence , some yearning or waiting for a future , if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almanac time , one 's age , or one 's appointments may be forgotten ; but it is impossible for a present to shine at all without some sense of present-past-future within it and beyond it . Space , although always available to the highly favored visual and kinaesthetic senses , and deemed universal by many minds ( be they naive or poetic or materialistic ) is certainly not necessary to all possible experience . It is iinenr pirical to assert that all experience is spatial . Time , as we have seen , 11A // is not spatial , ' nor is the experience of obligation , nor the memory of a promise once made , nor the hope that the object of unrequited love will change his or her mind . Temporal experience is not spatial , but spatial experience is in time . All geometrizing is a temporal process , even for the intuitive mathematician who sees the whole proof in one time-span . He could not see it in a timeless instant . Even an intuition takes time . All geometrizing ( as well as all knowl-edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at various times and true either of all times , or as of times specified in the proposition . The analysis of space experience always reveals reference to time , as the analysis of time experience does not involve ( except accidentally ) a reference to space . ' The interrelation of time and space is , however , most firmly estab-lished by the experience of motion . Motion is plainly a category of all physical sciences . Without motion , no physics , no chemistry , no astronomy or geology or biology would be possible . And motion is a category that weds time and space ; it is a spatiotemporal synthesis which , like all genuine Hegelian syntheses , adds something new to the thesis and antithesis . Motion is not the mere assertion that spaces continue to exist at different times or that different spaces exist at the same time . It is a new property which arises with an experienced correlation between changes of location in space and changes in the successive presents of the time experience . Motion combines , yet adds to , time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion has not , of course , escaped serious philosophical attention . It is true that philosophers like Parmenides and Zeno have sought to eradicate time and motion in favor of ( spherical ) space ; that a Shankara has denied the reality of all three in favor of a higher order of being available only to exalted mystics ; that a Kant and his followers have relegated them to the phenomenal while declaring things in themselves , the truly real , to be neither temporal nor spatial ; and that a Bergson has exalted time and debased space and motion . But not even these thinkers have failed to perceive the more or less correlated presence of these three dimensional categories in experience and to grant the need of interpreting them in relation to each other and to the facts of experience . In any case , time , space , and motion have become for physicists // key categories both for their observations in the shining present , and for the hypotheses which become the pillars of the postula-tional continuum for their explanatory theories . The " secondary " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensory qualities ) have de-scended almost to triviality in the sciences ; only the laws of " prima-ry " qualities ( time , space , motion ) are significant , because only they are subject to precise measurements . Former President J. B. Conant of Harvard has been quoted as saying that the progress of science is measured by the increase of the theoretical and the diminution of the empirical . It used to be said that the goal of physics is a single equation which would cover all possible motions of all possible masses at all possible times . But no increase of the theoretical and no complex set of equations could serve as an " illuminating absent " were the shining present to be set aside . Theory is of no impor-tance at all except to explain the facts ; theory has no claim to truth if it can not be tested by the facts . The facts of experience must be the ultimate validation or falsification of every theory about time-space-motion , as of every belief or hypothesis on any conceivable subject . Bare thinkability ( as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refutation of motion ) has no truth-value unless the " absent " that is thought really illuminates the " present . " 3 2 . TIME , THE MOST PERVASIVE CATEGORY Let us now consider time , the most pervasive category of both the given and the ungiven . We have seen that time ( as duration , not as conceptual , antifactual clock time , or measuring time ) is indissolubly involved in present experience . Were there any being independent of all experience , either it would endure or it would not endure . So far as we can tell , if it did not endure at all , it could not even be ; and if it endured it would be temporal . Time is empirically universal . Experience is always a time-span . Time is an aspect of all experience ? not merely of the sensory : Kant may have had this fact dimly in mind when he spoke of time as " the form of the inner sense . " He saw it more lucidly when he held that the moral law requires an immortal life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time ? and times . As already suggested , time is conceived in other ways , sometimes only remotely connected with this fundamental experience of dura- // tion . Time , as experienced , occurs as private , but it is believed to be public . Just because there are physical time , astronomical time , imaginary , fictional times , and historical times ? all of them com-plex experiences of , and inferences about , time ? we need a clear conception of time as a universal subjective-objective category . Such a conception would be applicable equally to all shining presents and all truly illuminating absents . ' It is true that there are those who deny the universality of time as a category . Certain objections were considered in Chapter 6 and others will be considered later in this chapter . Here let us refer in a preliminary way to those of poets and mystics . Is there " a realm that lieth sublime , out of space , out of time " ? Was Donald C. Babcock right in rebelling against both space and time when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed this revolt , while still clinging to existence . A few lines give the flavor of the whole . Time is a commodity that pays off poorly . Time is forever just missing an appointment with himself . Say not , " Lo here , or Lo there . " I was never any where . I would n't be caught dead with a body.3 There is ground in experience , we have seen , for denying that space is a category of all being . But how escape time without escap-ing being ? There are the mystics , nevertheless , who report experi-ences beyond space and time , whose testimony is more solid than that of the poets . Yet the mystic enters samadhi at a time and re-turns from samadhi at a later time . His experience could well be quite spaceless in its content and timeless with reference to bio-logical or astronomical time . It could genuinely transcend such times . Yet the basic time experience is compatible with all this ; in fact any time-span must transcend each instant in that span and may include an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's experience to be entirely beyond time , it would have to be so com-pletely negative as to have no enduring content or meaning at all . And this is surely not what the mystic means . It seems fair to say that the mystical experience , although a " real duration , " is in itself // indifferent to all ordinary time measurements . But it begins in time . It endures . It can be in some sense remembered . Although proclaimed ineffable , " it has been described in abundant prose , poetry , and psychology . That it is actually an experience without any duration at all is so improbable as to require much further evidence than has been adduced . We therefore stand by the proposition that time is a category of all shining presents . To deny time is to deny experience itself . We assert further that time is a category of all illuminating absents . It is , of course , possible to entertain the proposition : There is being that does not in any sense endure , has no temporal characteristics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or time to it . Contrary to those who identify time with change , our point of view identifies it with real duration . Were there no change , time could not be measured . But if any being endured , even changelessly , it would exemplify the category of time . We can , let us repeat , entertain a proposition that asserts some absolutely timeless " absent . " But such an absent would lack the property of illumination . Such a hypothetical absent could be en-tertained only to be denied . For how could it be coherent with , or relevant to , every shining present ? At best it is a useless hypothesis . It explains neither time nor change ; it illuminates nothing . Objective time , it would seem , is real duration , whether of " phys-ical " processes or of personal existence . The universe is a history or a series of histories . Time is ineradicable . Objective time gives meaning to change and must be presupposed before change is conceivable or possible . To try to make change more fundamental than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but time does not require change . It is , of course , true that empirically all temporal experience includes both change and identity . Personality , society , physical processes , the evolution of life , the emergence of novelties , the experience of creativity and of freedom are all examples of real duration in which experiences of identity of meaning and of being are united organically and in-separably with experiences of change . A universal temporalism such as is implicit in the category of time strongly suggests a universal personalistic idealism , that is , that whatever is real is constituted by enduring unities of experi-ence . To say that time is objective is to say that there is time order // in the universe beyond every human experience . But to go so far as to assert that this time order is beyond every possible experience , as some realists do , is to invite serious difficulty . A time inde-pendent of all possible experience is not only in principle unveri-fiable ; it stands in no coherent relation to actual time experience . If it be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a powerless abstraction from personal experience . Time which is not concrete , experienced duration , time which is some " entity " independent of our experience and of things , can not connect itself with them in any intelligible way or interact effectively with them . To be productive and causal , time must be an integral part of some agency ; but if it is such a constitutive part of an active agency , it can not remain " pure . " If time be considered unconscious , how relate it coherently to any conscious experience of time ? All being , then , is temporal . Whatever is , endures . Truth , whether about universals or particulars , about evils or about norms , endures at all times . Change may be transient or constant ; but all change is temporal and is known as change by its relation to some enduring meaning which is changeless and omnitemporal . Even Kant , who denied time to " things in themselves " found time neces-sary in his schematism for all knowledge and needed endless time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platonism and his essences , had to say , " Belief in time is , I think , the deepest belief we have . " 7 Andrew Seth , in his Hegelianism and Personality , de-clared that " if we give up time , we move out of reality altogether . " 8 And Whitehead , who found time in the consequent nature of God , would agree . Time , once more , is a category of all that there is . It is necessary even though it is only one facet of being . We have been hinting at metaphysical conclusions to be drawn from this view of time . Indeed , it is precisely in connection with time that the distinction between the shining present and the illu-minating absent is perhaps crucial . There is no doubt in anyone 's mind that time is actually experienced as an aspect which fulfills the conditions defining a category . There certainly is succession and duration ; time-span , or a specious present , is more than an instant . Wherever there is experience , shining present , there is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent that illu-minates this time ? An empirical idealist or personalist holds that any view of time must be coherent with time as it is found in the // shining present . He will therefore answer the question by replying that the unique nature of time as revealed " subjectively " must be included in any " objectively " valid account of time . He rejects any view of " absent " reality which renders his actual experience of time illusory . Indeed , having considered alternatives , he concludes that objective reality is itself an actual experience of time . For every other view of objective reality as nontemporal and nonexperiential fails to account for the time that the person finds in his experience . Some who wish to avoid this idealistic conclusion appeal to those mathematical and astrophysical considerations which have led men of science to regard time as a fourth dimension of space , thus think-ing time as an item in an equation which formulates the relations of the time dimension to the space dimensions . When time is identified with mathematical measurement of it ( or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " passage " vanishes and becomes a " myth , " as Professor Donald C. Williams calls it . If the empiricists asks Professor Williams for empirical bread , he is not given a stone ; he is given a number . An empiricist is as confident of the importance of mathematical reasoning as is any scientist . But he can not identify measurement with the reality measured . Empirically , what is meas-ured is a relation between actual and possible experiences . This is equally true of space and time . The argument against accepting the mathematical formula as metaphysical truth about time is equally good whether one agrees with Professor Williams that " the universe consists , without residue , of the spread of events in space-time , " or one agrees with the per-sonalists that the universe consists , without residue , of experients , selves , or persons . Natural events are not really geometry and arithmetic any more than present experience is really geometry and arithmetic.10 It may be added that on the view of the empirical personalist , " natural events " are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of absent situations believed to be illuminating ? yet not fully illuminating until conceived as experiences of other // mind . More , of course , will need to be said to substantiate this hy-pothesis . We have not yet completed the exposition of the time category . 3 . TIME AS ORDER Time , as we have seen , is not a formula or a geometrical dimen-sion of space . Time is experience of duration . All experience endures , yet not all aspects of experience are time . Time , for ex-ample , is not space , although space endures . Time is not color , or obligation , or reasoning , although colors , obligations , and reason-ings occur and endure in time . Time is the generic fact that experience and its " objects " ( whatever they may be ) endure through time-spans connected by memory-linkages with the past , and by anticipations with the future . Time , essentially , is a past-present-future order . Unique order . Time 's order is unique . Time has been com-pared to a line , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to possess a " gnawing tooth , " but it has no teeth at all . Time has been called " the mind of space , " but mind , while it is temporal , is far more than time . Chronological order is plainly different from logical order ; when the two coincide , it is usually as a result of intense effort of thought , and the coincidence is brief . Nor is chronological order an order of value : neither the best nor the worst normally comes either first or last in an historical time-series . Nor is time 's order like the order of the materials in a completed house . Those materials previously existed in a random order ; they were made by builders into a house-order . But the " materials " of time are essentially temporal ; they exist only when they exist , and they have no existence out of all time . The uniqueness of time may well have been in Kant 's mind when he said that " time is in itself a series ? and is the formal condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed by the uniqueness of time than is usually supposed when he held that the " Idea is process . " So too Plato , when he thought of the philosopher as spectator " of all time and all existence . " Irreversible . Time 's order is irreversible.i " What is past can never be present again , nor can the present alter it ( although evalu-ations of the past may change greatly ) . The future is not until it occurs . Relative to any actual present , the past is determinate and // the future is potential . To suppose that the whole of time is eter-nally laid out in a completed series , so that all presents , pasts , and futures are contemporary with every present , and perhaps accessible to immediate experience at every present , is to suppose a fantasy . It is not only contrary to all actual time experience , but it also makes freedom a mockery , and all attempts to alter the future vain . 3c . Time , permanence and change . The experience of time is a union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change ; yet change could neither occur nor be known were there not some permanent meaning in the change . If there were no logical constants , if the " I " in " I change " were meaningless , if there were nothing that changed and no laws of change ? then what could change be ? Not even present , past , and future could be , for they would constitute no meaningful frame of reference . Experience and being may well be in some sense always in process of change , but Heraclitus was right in making an exception of the law of change itself . He would have been even truer to the facts had he added that knowledge of the law of change presupposed the per-manence of the self ? that is , of the unity of consciousness in its self-experience , present , past , and future.l3 It is true that sometimes permanence and sometimes change is overemphasized , as by Parmenides and Heraclitus respectively . Today is the day of change ? despite stress on the eternal truths of symbolic logic . Change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these words , challenging static permanence in thought and being , are slogans of the twentieth century . The protest against permanence was embodied in John Dewey 's The Quest for Certainty ( 1929 ) . It is distilled in the poem " Credos " by Ruth Mary Weeks : Creation 's aeons are too long For finished creeds . He must be wrong Who knows the substance and the sum . Is there no wonder yet to come ? No revelation to be heard ? Time has the final word.14 Yet no poet is a literalist . Aging does not guarantee new truth ; age does not prove all old ideas false . For the poet , time is itself a permanent truth , a permanent ground for hope of new truth . A justified protest against dogmatic smugness does not involve rejec- // tion of all permanent structure and law . Were nothing permanent all truth would be undermined ; there could be no logic , no law , no measurement , no memory , and no purpose . Experience requires us to acknowledge both permanence and change as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time and purpose . The experience of time is intimately related to , and involved in , the experience of purpose . Purpose is close to the very essence of selfhood ? as James and Royce , and Hegel before them , taught . It is there to some degree in every moment of the shining present . To experience is , of course , to be aware of much that the self does not voluntarily produce or approve , but no experience is entirely devoid of purposive conation or striving . It must be granted that there are some states in which consciousness seems to be indifferent . These may be of two kinds , the neutral and the objective . The so-called neutral experiences , about which " we do n't care , " are close to boredom ; the more we have of them the less we enjoy life . In short , neutrality ( in psychology as in international relations ) is a disguised folin of aversion , and so of negative purpose . Objectivity is a different type of experience ; it is often called disinterestedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are guided and so is a very exalted purpose . Disinterestedness is not a lack of all interest . It is only a lack of selfish or self-centered interest , requiring a high degree of interest in truth , impartiality , and universality . It rests on a disciplined purpose , which too few , even among scientists and philosophers , are able to maintain throughout their investigations , and much less apply to all their practical choices . It has already appeared that time is a pervasive category . Purpose seems to be equally pervasive , although the extent of its application to the illuminating absent is not now under discussion . What , then , are the relations of time to purpose ? Ordinarily the word " end " refers to a process both telic and temporal and thus is used synonymously with purpose . It is the stopping place or conclusion of a process which aimed at this end from the start . End is finis , final cause . Yet to purpose is far more than to aim at a stopping place . All stations are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of the world is not the goal of all process . The richer meaning of purpose now becomes evident in two ways . On the one hand , the " end " is present ( at least tentatively ) in idea throughout the process and governs every stage of it ? the artist 's conception of the finished painting , the scientist 's ideal of experimental method , the plan of achieving peaceful understanding // among nations . Whenever the end drops from view , the process tends to develop confusion , and the end is destroyed . On the other hand , the highest ends are not stopping places at all ; they are but moments in the inexhaustible hours of purpose . If love is a moral end , there is no time to cease loving . Kant 's argument for immortality , defective as it may be , rests on the truth of the endlessness of moral obligation . If coherence is a logical end , that end is also endless ; for completed coherence can not be achieved in time with its incessant onrush of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive reference to finite stretches of time having literal " ends , " does this mean that purpose is independent of time and is essentially timeless ? Apart from previous discussion of the supposed concept of the timeless , purpose may be considered in relation to time in three senses . ( 1 ) Purposes may all be achieved in finite stretches of time ; if a tree or a human body has a purpose , that purpose has an " end " when the organism dies . Such purposes are exhausted in time . But it is possible that ( 2 ) purposes may be inexhaustible in any time . And ( 3 ) purposes may be wholly timeless , without reference , or relevance , to time experience . The third abstract possibility has no philosophical importance . By definition it can have no basis in , or meaning for , " the shining present . " It is literally meaningless . The second possibility remains . As has been shown , this possibility is involved in the very nature of valid scientific and moral ideals . Oddly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most eager to affirm it with reference to scientific ideals like the experimental method . This , then , is the problem . Does the inexhaustibility of some purposes in any finite time render purpose independent of time ? Far from it ! It is true that the validity of coherence , or experimental method , or verification does not depend on the state of affairs at any particular time . But it is also , and more adequately , true that such ideals owe their force and meaning to their applicability at all times . Ideal possibilities ? " eternal objects " ? that have no exemplification or time and are not even " entertained , " are , as Whitehead has rightly reiterated , literally nothing . The sum of this argument is that all purposes are temporal ? applying either to finite stretches of time , like an architect 's blueprint for a house , or else to all times , like the ideal of rationality . In every shining present , a purposive or telic process , a Whiteheadian " subjective aim , " can be detected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inextricably involved in each other . Certainly : // no time , no purpose . Quite possibly ( although this remains to be seen ) : no purpose , no time . 3e . Time , immanent and transcendent . It follows from the nature and reference of human experience as analyzed in Chapters 3 and 4 that time is both immanent and transcendent , both present and absent . As immanent in experience , it is a category of the shining present and is exemplified in the experienced time-spans with fading margins . The time-spans vary greatly in their actual duration , and there are no sharp divisions between them . But a given time-span is strictly immanent insofar as its present total grasp is a pastpresent-future felt in a unified whole of experience . For example , a town clock is striking . The single stroke of one is far longer than an indivisible instant of time . It includes , in fact ( mathematically ) , an infinite series of such instants , but it is felt as one whole , a single gestalt . Likewise , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity ( even though required by Whitehead 's theory of occasions ) to say that when the second stroke comes there is only a memory ( an " objective immortality " ) of the first stroke . Rather the one-two is as truly a single gestalt as is the one . So with one-two-three , and one-two-three-four . It would require a most delicate introspection to determine whether the onetwo . . . eleven-twelve is a single gestalt or part of a unified timespan gestalt and part memory . In any event , there is a complex experience of time which is a real duration composed of many pasts-presents-futures . " Present , " then , has a double meaning . It may mean the " equator " or the " imaginary " instant which divides what precedes it from what follows it . Or it may mean an actual shining present , which normally endures several seconds , and yet ( save for cases of complete unconsciousness ) is never empirically discontinuous with previous shining presents . " There are no leaps " in the shining present . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems probable , periods of unconsciousness , when " my " shining present ceases to shine , there is then a discontinuity of actual experience . But insofar as I know that I was unconscious , my memory links my present with the past before unconsciousness intervened . Thus , for all normal cases , at least , that discontinuity is bridged by memory , to which the experience of self-identity is essential . This discussion has been necessary to make clear the most elementary meanings of immanence and transcendence . When one grasps a time-span in a shining present , the situation is one of pure // immanence . But when one " remembers " a past shining present , that is , what was once " my " present experience , the situation is a reference from what is now present to what is not now present ? that is , to an illuminating absent , a situation-believed-in . There are , therefore , at least three distinct meanings of temporal transcendence. ( 1 ) Within any given time-span , the total duration grasped transcends every instant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires the " s " sound before the " ay " sound , and each com-ponent sound takes time . The total word " say " ( as much as the longer word " parallelopipedon " ) requires a succession of temporal instants all of which are transcended in the whole experience . ( 2 ) Memory , as a valid reference to the past , primarily intuitive ( although always requiring rational checks and tests for its valid-ity ! ) , is transcendent in a different sense . It unites into a whole experiences that are not present in any given shining present " now . " Yet nothing can be remembered by anyone which was not once in that " anyone 's " shining present . In memory , the shining present of today 's experience is transcended , yet the reference of memory is always to what " I " felt , observed , believed , or reasoned . Memory , then , transcends any given shining present , but not all shining presents . Before turning to the third meaning of transcendence , attention should be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making the past present . It is true that the fact of memory is always a present fact when it exists . It is also true that what is remem-bered is often more important , and more vivid ( vs . Hume ) , than the dull present . But to infer from this that the past is actually present is to deny the objective reference of memory and the very meaning of time experience . Second is the error of denying the unity of the self in memory . Since memory is of the past , it is some-times erroneously inferred that the " self " of the past and of the present can not be " the same self . " It is true that the two " selves " ( shining presents ) can not be at the same time , and can not be the same phases or aspects of the self . But since the identity of the self is a categorical requirement for the meaning of " I remember , " memory is an instance of the unity of the self . The self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the experienceable unity of all my past ( remembered ) and future ( anticipated ) shining presents . ' ' But our theory requires a third type of transcendence. ( 3 ) An illuminating absent must be acknowledged ? one which is not in // any sense my shining present , although related to it as its cause " and itself an experience of time-spans . This principle of tran-scendence is a reference to something more than " my " past , " my " present , or " my " future . It is a universal epistemic requirement ; it is given as involved in all experience , when coherent reasoning is admitted to be an experience . It has special reference to time . The i ' illuminating absent must " explain " the present of time in the shin-ing present . It too ( as Hegel and Whitehead have declared ) must be process . The illuminating absent , in this third type of transcend-ence , must include all selves or shining presents which are not " mine . " The shining present not only includes memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hate , social institutions all presuppose and require acknowledgment by each person that there are other shining presents communicating and interacting with mine.17 Each of the communicators must be assumed to in-clude time experience . Why are two communicators needed ? Why not assume , as some do , a literally common experience , a shining present equally present to the " I " and the " thou " ? This assumption , while it has some plausible features , is to be rejected for several reasons . ( 1 ) There is no proof that " my " feeling and " thy " feeling are identical , even in the case of great similarity . ( 2 ) Differences of opinion about the meaning of experience show that the two shining presents are not completely identical . ( 3 ) Assertion of a strictly identical common experience contradicts the meaning of memory that the experience E was " my " experience , not " thine . " ( 4 ) Assertion of a common experience undermines the very meaning of social com-munication , cooperation , and love . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconcile with the experienced unity of consciousness . ( 6 ) The belief in such common experience is mysti-cal , in the purely emotional sense , rather than rational . Yet it makes genuine mysticism , as a personal relation to other beings , human or divine , impossible . " Rejoice with me for I have become God " means that I am no longer myself , with my memories and responsibilities . There remains a further question about the transcendent illumi-nating absent . Accurate measurement of time , whether historical or physical , is achieved only by reference to a temporal-spatial order of motion , which is commonly called nature . Whether nature is // itself a ( superhuman ) shining present which illuminates all other ( human , subhuman ) shining presents ? as idealists believe ? or whether nature is an unconscious and impersonal dark source of all shining presents ? as materialists , naturalists , and some realists believe ? is a question that must be laid on the table for a while . The question might be phrased : Is the present a shining image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for what is not in " my " shining present ? To sum up : Time 's order is both immanent and transcendent . The immanent order is in " my " shining present . The transcendent order is partly in " my " past and future shining presents , but it is also objectively in " nature , " whatever nature may turn out to be . 4 . RELATIVITY OF TIME Time is an experience and a category . Yet time as " given " raises many problems . It is interrupted by sleep . Its " feel " varies with the emotions , the interest , the attention , the purposes , the health , and the environment of the experient . If time is to be a basis for planning , or for social relations , or for understanding of the ongoing of process , subjective or objective , it must be measured . All measurement is an example of relativity , in the broadest sense . If a primitive chieftain says to his clan , " Let us meet when the shadow of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealing to relativity . His frame of reference assumes a clear day , the sun , the rock , the tree , and the shadow of the tree . This frame is a complex situation-believed-in ( or illuminating absent ) in which all members of the clan have confidence on the basis of their shining presents , their memories , and their interpretations . Other relativities are discovered : the succession of days and nights , for which the sun is the center of reference ; the succession of months , measured with reference to the moon ; the succession of the years , measured by the seasons as well as by increasing astronomical observations ; the regularity or rate of motion measured by changes of relation in space-objects like sun-dials , and hourglasses , and finally by clocks ; biological time , measured by rings in the trunks of trees , or by growth , or by biological changes in the male or female ; geological , meteorological , and astronomical changes , measured by tides , floods in the Nile , stratifications in the rocks , fossils , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a system of relativities . The more accurate the measurements , the more complex the relativities . The apple falling from // the tree was a good start for Newton ; but the telescope on Mt . Palomar and Einstein 's complicated equations are needed to meas-ure the relativities of time today . From the point of view of general metaphysics , it is not necessary to review the details of the pragmatic chronometry of the chieftain or the scientific relativity of Einstein or of Whitehead.l " What is necessary at this point is to make clear the nature and presupposi-tions of any possible theory of relativity , if it is to be true . Most of these presuppositions are now already evident , but they and others may now be stated as follows : ( 1 ) Time is an undeniable fact of all shining presents . ( 2 ) The shining present is , therefore , the empirical standard by which every theory must be tested . ( 3 ) All theories , reasonings and formulae , all experiments and " operations , " are themselves experiences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data them-selves. ( 4 ) The ideal of coherence ( also empirical ) is a presupposi-tion of all science and philosophy , as well as of the validity of memory and the possibility of communication . ( 5 ) The ideal of coherence requires the long-tested hypothesis that there is an illu-minating absent which is the objective field of experiments and operations.19 ( 6 ) All propositions about absents must therefore be tested , not alone by their theoretical consistency as hypotheses , but also , and even more certainly , by their systematic coherence with the facts of experience . ( 7 ) All theories of time , then , are reasonings of persons about the nature and implications of personal experience.20 ( 8 ) Relativity , instead of undermining personal experience , re-enforces the basic importance of the shining present , reveals its complex structure and powers , emphasizes the observer and his frame of reference , and points out the inescapable relatedness of the human experient to the whole objective universe revealed by scientific observation , ex-periment , and theory . Bacon once said that " truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have added that time is the daughter of experience . She is a daughter without whom the parent could not be at all . So important a daughter is a category . Bacon might also have specified that the parent is always a conscious person . There is no impersonal experience of time . Time and truth , then , are the offspring of personality.22 Relativity always presupposes the ob-serving , reasoning , time-binding , time-transcending person . Other-wise there are no observers , no facts , and no theories . 5 . ETERNALISM AND TEMPORALISM Thus far time has been taken to be the most pervasive category of our experience , and hence also the most pervasive category of every " absent " which is not our experience . At least this would be true of every being that can be inferred from , or intuited by , or in any wise related to , our experience . What is not thus related to us is no theme for philosophers , but only for myth-makers ? yet not even myth escapes some rootage in experience . The view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporalism and implies that time-experience affords a category for all illuminating absents , as well as for the structure of the self . There is , however , an opposing view to which the name eternalism is given , drawing all time from " eternity , " so that time is " a moving image of eternity . " In evaluating eternalism we confront a whole barrage of questions : Is time ultimate ? Has there always been and will there always be time as long as there is anything at all ? Or is there literally a timeless reality ? an eternal on which time depends ? Is the eternal prior to , and more real than , anything temporal ? Is everything temporal transient and perishing , while only the eternal endures ? Or can the eternal endure without duration ? Is time a dependent product of the eternal ? Or are there two independent orders of light and darkness ? Ormazd and Ahriman ? one tem-poral , one eternal , in conflict with each other ? Will there be a time when " time shall be no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest philos-ophers , scientists , and theologians . Parmenides , Heraclitus , Plato ( " time a moving image of eternity " ) , Aristotle , Plotinus , Augustine ( " if you do not ask me , I know " ) , Shankara ( maya and Brahman ) , John Calvin ( predestination ) , Berkeley ( " lost and embrangled in // inextricable difficulties " ) , Kant ( antinomies ) , Hegel ( " Idea is process " ) , S. Alexander ( restlessness of Space-Time ) , H. Bergson ( elan vital and creative evolution ) , Kierkegaard ( " infinite qualitative difference between time and eternity " ) , Bradley ( relational thinking ) , Bowne ( time phenomenal only ) , Royce ( all-inclusive timespan ) , Perry ( neutral entities ) , Whitehead ( temporalism with eternal objects ) , Newton ( absolute time ) , and Einstein ( relative time ) are names suggesting mountain peaks in the history of thought . It is not our task to climb them all . Let us rather analyze the problem itself . The word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Among many religious believers it sometimes refers to life after death ? an " eternal life " in an order of being different from the natural world . Yet , however different these two orders may be conceived to be , the " eternal " realm is taken to be one where conscious experience continues and where time persists as real duration , although the " natural " measures of time ? physical , biological , astronomical ? may be wholly absent . ( 2 ) For others , " eternal " is a value term , The expression " eternal life " in the Gospel of John , for example , seems to denote a life devoted to imperishable value rather than a life beyond the grave . Thus , Miinsterberg has written of Eternal Values , continuing the age-old notion of Plato 's Ideas or Forms , which are beyond all change and time . Eternity here connotes the imperishability of true good . ( 3 ) For still others , the eternal connotes a yet more transcendent and unempirical order of being , appropriate to God alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience by his highest unio rnystica or samadhi , so there are two worlds ? the world of ordinary experience ( natural , phenomenal , maya ) and the world of extraordinary experience ( supernatural , ontological , divine ) . Parmenides speaks of " the way of opinion " and " the way of truth . " There is an apparent kinship here between religious experience and the structure of logical thought . As the mystical moment transports one from " this " world to the " other , " so logical reasoning transports the mind from dependence on the particular moments of experience to a grasp of the unchanging universal and its eternally necessary implications . That these levels of experience exist ? sense and reason , visible and invisible , natural and supernatural ? is a matter of empirical fact . But there remains the question whether there is a Kierkegaardian " absolute qualitative difference " between these levels or // whether there is an underlying and meaningful connection between them , both empirical and rational . Experience may be absolutely divided so as to require the assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal , one discoverable in expe-rience and the other revealed only in special experiences standing in no coherent relations to the rest of the shining present . But if there are two such worlds and if experience is thus " bifurcated , " l " then the aim of philosophy is foiled and reliance on coherent reason must be abandoned . Before a skepticism so desperate is adopted ? a skepticism which opens the floodgates not only to this particular irrationalism but to every other kind without check ? every effort should be made to relate the temporal and the eternal , the natural and the super-natural , the empirical and the rational . If they remain wholly apart , life is not merely more than logic , as Lotze and Bowne held ; life is free from rational guidance or restraint and from all rational mean-ing . Mystical contemplation and logical analysis become irrelevant to the interpretation of experience . Thought , if it be of any value , has only the value of escape from time and the ongoing of expe-rience . Better be " a pagan suckled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious or secular , which puts asunder what God hath joined together ! It is , of course , not to be presupposed that man has prior knowledge of God 's conjunctions , but it is man 's rational obligation to seek for such unions and relations as are involved in actual ex-perience . It is not rational or empirical to seek only for analytic separations when experience gives or requires synoptic unions as well as separations or to be satisfied with immediate contexts when a larger whole is indicated . ( 4 ) In place of the divisive and relatively incoherent views that have been considered , it is probable that time and eternity are more closely and empirically interrelated than has been supposed . Let us. then , suggest that the eternal must be a function of time , rather than time an incomprehensible function of eternity . Time as we experience it is not merely the measure of motion or the fact of change : it is the total real duration of personal experience in the shining present . Hence the absent being which this present faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must he also a real duration . For how can the nontemporal , the nonenduring , produce the temporal without itself being or becoming temporal at // the very moment time began ? Does the supposedly unchanging not change the moment it produces time ? But further , thought can not conceive of an absolute beginning out of nothing . Ex nihilo ? nihil fit ; out of nothing , nothing is made . If ever there was absolutely nothing , then there would always be nothing.2 " If reason be trustworthy at all , this reasoning is neces-sary . Kant 's attempted proof that a beginning of time is equally necessary with an unbegun time is not conclusive . It is true that imagination falters ; an unbegun time can not be pictured , any more than a picture of a mathematical point , or of purpose , or reason is possible . But the unpicturable , in this instance , can and must be thought . For the alternative is to try to think the unthinkable ? an unbegun , nontemporal eternity initiating a temporal series and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the experience of time and of reason , " he is led to infer at least two properties of time that can not be given in any single shining present , yet are true of all possible shining presents . First , he will infer that time is unbegun and unending , since a real beginning would mean an effect without a cause , and a real end would mean a cause without an effect . Second , he will infer that there are truths that are true at all times , such as the truth about time and reason , and whatever can be in-ferred from them . Such considerations lead us back to an earlier suggestion that the eternal is not the nontemporal but the omni-temporal . To sum up : The shining present points to and involves an illu-minating absent that is unbegun and unending duration and in which may be discovered truths that are tine at all times . To as-sume any other meaning of eternity ? such as " an infinite qualita134 PERSON AND REALITY - live difference between time and eternity " ? is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purposes of aesthetic sublimity ( Kant ) or of religious awe ( R. Otto ) , this un-imaginable but empirically coherent concept of eternity may well be adequate : the eternal is the unbegun and the unending.27 6 . TEMPORALISM AND PERSONALISM If time is the most pervasive category of experience , and if ab-sent being is itself temporal , can we avoid the conclusion that a true metaphysics must be both a temporalism and a personalism ? It is true that many have supposed that an impersonalistic temporal process is possible . They would insist on our temporalism but not on our personalism . In experience , they would agree , we find time , space , and motion . If , however , time experience be reduced to abstract succession in which novelties appear , then it is possible that the illuminating absent is some sort of unconscious , impersonal process , in which consciousness and its experienced time " emerge . " Thus , by use of this method of elimination , the temporalist may become a naturalist and not a personalist . The eternalist eliminates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but makes personal experience a by-product of it . Now , of course , it must be granted that some " elimination " or " reduction " is necessary to rational thought . The absent would illuminate nothing if it were identical with the present . The present is crammed with incoherencies and with signs of its own incom-pleteness . An " objective " philosophy must discriminate between the significant and the insignificant , although it must find some account of every fact , however insignificant it may seem . The trouble with naturalism is that it throws out the baby with the bath . In retaining only that which is immediately useful for the physical sciences , namely , dependable sequence or succession , it neglects and even rejects that which is essential both to sub-jective meaning and to objective being , namely , the real duration of the personal experience . The eternalist must show how the non- // temporal can produce the temporal ; the naturalist must show how the abstract , temporal succession can produce the enduring , unified shining present if there is nothing enduring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , is the hypothesis that all being ? both every shining present and every genuinely illuminating absent ? is either a personal experient ( a complex unity of consciousness ) or some phase or aspect of one or more such experients . The postu-late now being presented is this : All being is temporal and there-fore all being is personal . Again , let us , for the sake of the argument , suppose the contrary . Let us assume that being is process or evolution , or some sort of temporal succession , but without conscious experience . Then we are supposing a time without the experienced property of a time-span , a time without the experience of memory , yet somehow in-volving reference to a past , a time without experienced purpose or expectation , yet somehow involving reference to a future . Such a " naturalistic " or " realistic " or " impersonal " view of time is so barren of the essential ingredients of time experience as to be utterly in-adequate as a metaphysical hypothesis . It is but the barren , ab-stract ghost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the real duration of a real experience beyond our own , or else the exist-ence of the time , which we experience as conscious unities with memories and purposes , must be left an unexplained and incoherent miracle . The hypothesis of personalistic idealism is , therefore , both more empirical and more rational than either eternalism or natural-ism . The problem may be clarified by reference to a noteworthy theory of W. T. Stace.Z$ Stace avows himself a naturalist as far as the tem-poral world is concerned , but an eternalist as regards metaphysical reality . This eternalism , based on intuition rather than reason , leads to a modern double truth and a close approach to irrationalism . Of the divine object of intuition , it can not be said that we have rational knowledge ; but we do have symbols . The most satisfactory symbol is spirit or person . If this be true , Stace might well be asked why this spirit or person can not also serve as a " symbolic " explanation of the natural order too . Furthermore , how can any symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rational objective knowledge ? A personalist holds that the truth in naturalism and the truth in eternalism can best be reconciled and interpreted by the truth in personalism . " Nature " can not account for consciousness // or for experienced time , while impersonal eternity can not account for real process and evolution . The postulate of ever-enduring per-sonality as the objective real accounts for both. = " On the personalistic view , then , the universe is time and tide ? tempus and Zeit . And this universe , experienced by us in enduring and overlapping cuts or sections of time , is a society of persons , derived from the unity of an ever-enduring source of all other dura-tion , the unbegun and unending person called God . A personalist does not pretend that this concept is susceptible to absolutely necessary demonstration . He offers it as an hypothesis about the illuminating absent which is more adequately coherent with the total evidence of the shining present than any other that is available . Chapter 8 SPACE AND MOTION 1 . SPACE AND TIME Time and space are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to seem to separate them by treating space and motion in an independent chapter . Nevertheless , the closeness of interrelation between time , space , and motion must not allow us to overlook the fact that time , as we have seen , is more pervasive in experience than space and motion . Actually it is from the point of view of sensory experience that time is always associated with space ? so much so that physical science tends to regard time as a fourth dimension of space . That this is justified within the physical or phenomenal frame of reference is adequately demonstrated by measurements based on observations and in turn verified by repeated experiments . It is not the task of metaphysicians to record or repeat the work of physicists , although they accept its validity and are obligated not to contradict it . It is the task of metaphysicians , however , both to examine the empirical and logical presuppositions of physics and also to evaluate the empirical facts which physicists must omit if they are to be physicists . ' Metaphysicians , if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind , whether physical or not physical . What are the facts ? la . Both in shining present . Any observation of any shining pres-ent reveals its temporal character ; and spatial characteristics are present in every shining present that contains or refers to , or is de-rived from , sensory experience . ' Space is with equal certainty a // category of all sensory experiences and objects and their derivatives . Nonspatial validities , like the obligation to be rational , do not apply directly to space objects like a square . A square has no obligation to be square or be rational . But insofar as space objects are " in , of , or for a person , " the person is obligated to think rationally about all his space objects . Space objects ( whether in any shining present or the illuminating absent ) are at all times , then , subject to time-rules , but time-rules are also applicable to choices , reasonings , ideals , values , and universals which are not space-objects and which are not subject to space-rules . To repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our given time and space experiences ; and all space experiences are temporal , although not all time-experiences are spatial.3 Whatever our theories of finite or infinite physical space may be , and however those theories are related to theories of time experi-ence , all theories must find their evidence , their formulation , their development , and their testing within the shining present . Other-wise they are unempirical and , even as theories , are unknown . ' lb . Sensation is spatial . It is correct to say that all sensations have the spatial form . They have spatial dimensions and are " local-ized " in some sort of space system . That localization is much clearer in vision and touch than in hearing or smell but to some degree is always present . But it can not necessarily or probably be inferred from the spatiality of sensation that sensations are independent of the shining present and but loosely and momentarily attached to it or known by it . To suppose that " sensa " are objective realities , grasped immediately by the shining present , but independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the content of the shining present and to assume that the present can be identical with the absent . Sensations are in fact members of a shining present and are signs of an illuminating absent . But it is equally true for the most rational forms of both realism and idealism that a sign need not // resemble its object or referent . ' Safety is not green , although a green light is a sign of safe progress . To assert that in addition to experienced sensations , there are unexperienced sensa populating the universe is a needless and arbitrary violation of the lex parsi-moniae . The important point for the present is to make clear that sensa-tions are experienced as spatial , in the context of a personal expe-rience ; and that physical space , as well as metaphysical space , is an order ( phenomenal or cosmically metaphysical ) which lies beyond our experience as an order for thought and belief , postulated to explain the fragmentary space experiences of human shining pres-ents . If this inferred , objective space order is itself not the experi-ence of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it is the space order of a cosmic Mind whose nature is to interact and communicate with all other minds on all levels , then our metaphysics is personalistic and idealistic . Why is this so ? When we are believing something about space , whether sci-entifically or philosophically , it is better to believe what is coherent with all experience than what is unexperienceable by an experient . To say that there is a space independent of any experient is possible , but what does it do to help us understand the spatial character which we experience ? Does it not complicate our problem further by forcing upon us such questions as : How is such independent space related to the space of experience , which is never experienced as independent ? And how is such independent space related to experience itself , which is nonspatial ? Or , how is such space related to that in our experience which is nonspatial ? Is it not better to believe what is coherent with our nonspatial experiences ? Such " betterness " rests ultimately on synoptic coherence for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shining present other than the human which is in interaction with the human , it is difficult to see what facts of experience are not accounted for . At the same time , a conception of space is developed which is in closer agreement with the fact that the space we experience is always interrelated with nonspatial experience . Let us re-emphasize this observation . lc . No space without time . There is no space without time . It is relevant to reiterate the fact that space is never experienced or thought without the experience ( or thought , which is a kind of experience ) of time . Any real or imagined space endures . State-ments about space always involve statements about time ? either // about particular times or about all times . On the other hand , not all statements about time involve space . This relation between space and time is illustrated in the psycho-logical fact of what Bowne called " picture thinking . " There are many persons who enjoy television more than radio because they find pictures more intelligible than words or music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that the atom could be made comprehensible only by means of a " model " of it . But a three-dimensional static model is now regarded as a very inadequate representation of an atom that is a field of force , to which quantum theory and indeterminacy apply , and the behavior of which can be measured only by use of non-Euclidean , multidimension geometries . Atoms can no longer be pictured . They must be thought ; they are , in the literal etymological ( if not in the metaphysical ) sense , noumena , not phenomena ? objects of thought , not of sense . In any case , space , picturable or not , is more akin to sense and time more akin to mind in all its functions . Ask the ordinary man to picture space , and he will find it easy . Ask him to picture time , and he will show you space ? a clock or a sundial . He may speak of time as a river or stream . But time is really unpicturable , as Bergson has taught us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact . But the category of space , conveniently pie-turable as it may seem to be ( or as satisfactory as geometries are within their realm ) is less universal and therefore less metaphysical than time . If we may speak of degrees of reality , ' time has a higher degree of reality than space simply because it is more inclusive and more universal . There is no universal , abstract or concrete , to which time is irrelevant . 1d . Kant on space and time . Light may be shed on the concept of space-time ' by some consideration of the thought of Kant , whose epochal Critiques can be disregarded only by those who can learn nothing from history . Kant , as we have noted , ' spoke of space and time as forms of sensibility . It was doubtless his interest in sensi-bility and in Newton 's physics that led him to name space first . As we have seen , an interest in the total situation-experienced and in metaphysics would give time the priority . It is very interesting to note , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more adequate and inclusive , it assigns a greater and greater importance to time , explicitly , or implicitly . For ex-ample , Kant takes over a current , and unclear , doctrine of inner and outer sense . The outer sense is spatial ; the inner , temporal . This is not at all clearly empirical , for all outer objects are temporal , too ; and space is introspectively available to memory , imagination , and geometrical thinking . There are , however , two important sugges-tions in the doctrine of the two forms of sense . One is that both space and time are forms of experience ; and the other is that time is more truly " inner , " that is , nearer to the essence of mind , than is space . The higher valuation of time by Kant is even more evident in his doctrine of the schema . Here time is the principle which alone is common to sensibility and all the categories , and which , therefore , guarantees the possibility of the application of the categories to sense experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , especially in the postulate of immortality . Whatever one may think about the final adequacy of Kant 's argument for immortality , it is a clear expression of the insight that time is essen-tial to personal morality in a sense in which space is not . To argue that infinite space is necessary to the moral life would be trivial . To argue that endless time is necessary is far from trivial . It is a statement of the truth that morality has application only if and when there are persons . If persons cease , morality ceases . If , as Lotze also suggested , what ought to be is , then persons will never cease to be . ' 2 . REALMS OF SPACE As we have considered the various kinds and properties of tem-poral order , so we should consider the kinds and properties of spatial order ? not , indeed , in the manner of geometers and the physical scientists , for they have done that work for us , but in the manner of one seeking for empirical roots and metaphysical fruits of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present . We have already reiterated that space experience in the shining present is a given fact . Sometimes it occurs without theoretical justification . For example , judgments of dimensions and distance ( especially at sea and in observing the heavenly bodies ) may be ludicrously wrong . But all sensory expe-rience , including the wildest imagination , assumes some sort of space // form . Likewise , the most precise measurements and the most abstruse mathematical reasonings also occur in a shining present . Spatial interpretations are facts of experience which , as far as we know , occur in all shining presents at some times . The reasonings reveal many kinds of space . Let us call the spaces in the shining present psychological ? waking space , imaginary space , dream space , reasoned space . Since all psychological ( or phenomenal ) spaces refer to an " absent " ( or noumenal ) space , the analysis of types of absent space ? the " referent " of psychological space ? be-comes our chief task . 2b . In the illuminating absent . Reasoning about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various types of space . ( 1 ) Geometrical space is an order discovered by reasoning . It has been found that a geometry based on three-dimen-sional ( Euclidean ) space is possible and valid ; and that multidimen-sional spaces ( Riemannian , etc. ) are equally possible ? possible , it is true , for mathematical reasoning , although quite impossible for picture-thinking to grasp . Without geometry ( and arithmetic ) , science would be impossible , except as a lawless heaping up of factual observations . A further type of space is ( 2 ) the physico-astronomical , the space of the order of nature . This is an order that extends beyond the scope of any and all human shining presents . Yet it is an " absent " based on observations and reasonings in shining presents . There is no continuity of experience , it is true , from one observation of the sun in A 's shining present to another observation of the same scene in B 's shining present . But these discontinuous observations require A and B to postulate a continuous physico-astronomical order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experi-ences can be understood . As A. N. Whitehead declares , the actual occasions ( which are shining presents of a peculiarly Whiteheadian type ) are " incurably atomic . " 10 But thought also requires that they be incurably interactive ( communicating , or prehensive in White-head 's language ) . Note that it is thought , rather than untested situation , which requires the postulate of an order of interaction in physico-astronomical space . Without this rational postulate of in-teraction , all talk about knowledge of an outer world , or of the velocity of light , would be groundless.11 // There is also the realm ( 3 ) dream space , that is , the imaginary and fictional , including mirror space . These spaces , while bearing obvious dimensional relations to the physical order , lack continuity . Thought can not move coherently from any point in " Wonderland " to any point in " real " space . There remains ( 4 ) metaphysical space ? the perspective from which thought views space if it is to have a coherent account of all the spaces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be viewed ? As an objective container , external to and independent of all shining presents ? This " realistic " view would have to assign all imaginary spaces to some locus in " real " space . While such views are not impossible , the fact that they have no ground in experience or in mathematical reasoning , leads us to search for a more empirical and more reasonable alternative . We now consider that alternative . 3 . PERSONALISTIC VIEW OF TIME AND SPACE Space and time belong together both in science and in metaphysics , in science for mathematical reasons and in metaphysics for perspectival reasons . The metaphysical perspective must be inclusive or miss its aim entirely . Metaphysics is either realistic or idealistic , that is , the objective real must be viewed as either nonmental or as mental . There is nothing about objectivity ? reference to an object ? which requires that an object be nonmental . Were that true , minds could never be known . Nor does the mere fact of objectivity ? that is , of reference from the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is when we examine objects concretely that the need and the ground for a metaphysical decision arises . Time we have found to be in essence the experience of a timespan , requiring for its very nature and structure the unity of consciousness , memory , and awareness of succession and duration . If one strips from time all its mental traits , then its unity , its order , and its very being are reduced to shadows . " Time is the mind of space , " says Alexander . Better say , " Time is mind . " We experience time as duration of mind ; why invent a nonmental " event " or " order " ? Space is also primarily an order of conscious experience ? less essential to the very being of mind than is time , to be sure , but categorically essential to the phenomenal order of its " physical " experiences . The existence of space order is certainly not dependent on the will of human observers ; but this fact provides no // evidence whatever for the supposition that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain considerations which conspire against a realistic view of space at the same time favor the idealistic-personalistic hypothesis . They are : ( a ) the in-tellectual-logical structure of all geometries , ( b ) the fact that space-order is available for communication among minds , 12 ( c ) the fact that the application of space-rules to the " physical " order requires a high degree of mental activity , ( d ) the normal assumption of interaction between space-objects and minds , and ( e ) the difficulty of conceiving such interaction if space-objects are entirely uncon-scious and nonmental . The realistic hypothesis invents entities which are by their very nature unempirical ? never at hand in any shining present . Both hypotheses are possible ; realism is , however , less coherent with experience and hence more improbable . Exactly what is the personalistic theory of space and time ? It is this . The fragmentary times and spaces experienced in the shining presents of human experients are signs of valid orders of time and space which are " absent " from the human experients and extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the mathematical and physical ? find their coherent referent , their ultimate cause , their explanation and their possibility in the ever-enduring , un-begun , and unending experience of a cosmic Person . The cosmic Person is a shining present in which ( or better , in whom ) time and space are always given . It is by his active will that time and space as found in human experience are always ordered , organized , and communicated to other minds . The postulation of this cosmic Person13 or Experient can not be taken as a final proof . Indeed , no human knowledge is based on " final proof , " which would demand complete experience and perfect reasoning . So far , however , it may be viewed as a reasonable hy-pothesis , coherent with experience , mathematics and the sciences . If the hypothesis be true , then there are objective standard times and spaces in the cosmic Experient ; but there is no time or space external to all mind . To put it otherwise : Minds or experients are not in time or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cosmic or otherwise . As relations of actual and possible experiences // in minds , human , subhuman , and superhuman , they are real and valid . As something external to all possible experience they are sheer imaginations or inventions praeter necessitatem , " beyond necessity , " as well as beyond experience . It may be said , in passing , that to urge against the personalistic view that it is anthropomorphic ? that it makes human experience a standard for the universe ? is both trivial and incoherent . For all thought must be based on human experience in the shining present , and we can not have either personalistic or impersonalistic views of anything without relying on a rational view of human experience . If it is wrong to infer a cosmic Experient from the generic traits of time and space alone , then is it not more wrong to infer scientific laws from the far less generic and far more physiologically conditioned evidence of the senses ? This particular argument against personalism is equally an argument against scientific thinking and , indeed , against all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . 4 . MOTION Experience drives us to another category , which is the synthesis of time and space , namely , motion . It is clear that motion is a category ; for without it the whole phenomenal-physical order would be wiped out . Were there time and space , but no motion , arithmetic and geometry would be possible , but not the physical sciences . Motion is not a category of all experience or all objects . An ethics of will and of ideals would be possible without motion . An aesthetics of music and all the arts , except the dance , would be possible without motion ? relying , to be sure , on the imagination in which music , sculpture , and painting are born , without reference to the technical actualization of artistic ideals . So also the intellectual and the religious values would be possible without motion . In fact , it may be said that motion is expressive of what is not motion , but a purpose , a meaning , or a formula . Motion is not a fundamental metaphysical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion ; but much of change is time-organization , without immediate relevance to space . Motion , then , is a phenomenal or physical ( astrophysical ) category , not a metaphysical category of all possible being , as time is . Motion , it has been said , is the synthesis of space and time . This does not mean , however , that the thought of space plus the thought of time is the thought of motion . One could think forever of the // changeless properties of geometrical space , and of the successive contents of time without once thinking of spatial motion . Motion can not be derived from space and time by any process of necessary inference . Motion is an original experience , but yet not uniquely original as are space and time . All analysis of space reveals temporal properties , down to instants . But analysis of motion reveals more than mere motion ; it reveals something spatial occupying different places at different times . Motion , then , is not merely space plus time ; it is a unique coordinate of changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now-here , then-there , but it is , empirically , a continuous transition from here to there and from now to then . The kind of transition in motion differs from the kind of transition in reasoning , or in moral obligation , or in the spectrum . The category of spatial motion has been emphasized not only because of its relation to life itself and its vast practical utility to humanity in the attainment of desired ends , but also , and more rationally , because of its amenability to mathematical measurements . A science of color is impossible as long as one is restricted to the appearance of color in the shining present ; it becomes possible as soon as a science of the measurement of the motions of light-waves ( in the illuminating absent ) is developed . Motion , then , is indeed a synthesis of space and time . In it we make the discovery of the new empirical property of a correlated transition , and in it we find an essential principle of all the physical sciences . 5 . MOTION REALISTICALLY CONCEIVED Since motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since some are convinced that the physical sciences give us all the genuine knowledge we have , there are those who would restrict all reliable knowledge to physics . Indeed , there are some persons who reject not only philosophy , but also psychology and the social sciences , and who betake themselves to physics as " real science . " The physical sciences are , it is true , the sciences which apply mathematics to motion precisely . If the only acceptable knowledge is application of mathematics to motion , " physicalism " is correct . But if physicalism omits any facts of experience ( as it obviously does ) , then it reduces the metaphysical perspective illegitimately and is rightly condemned as reductionism , in spite of the truth and importance of physics . The important is not necessarily the whole . If all knowledge were physical , no person could ever understand another except in terms of measurements of bodily motion ! // Whether motion is the one ultimate reality ( as many material-ists have held ) or only one among many aspects of experience and being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more searching , than any physicist needs to raise , namely : What is the objective nature and causer of motion ? Or , in our termin-ology : What , in the coherently-believed-in illuminating absent , is the being to which our knowledge of motion refers ? And what in such an illuminating absent produces that form of illumination in our " present " which we call observation of motion ? Those who assert that motion is a kind of being external to , and independent of , all shining presents are called realists.15 The ex-perienced facts about motion that suggest realism may be sum-marized as follows : ( i ) Most of the motions observed directly in shining presents ( and ascribed to appropriate " absents " ) are not due to the will or choice of the experient ( although some seem to be ) . The motions of the heavenly bodies , of wind and tide , of animal life , and of much that we locate in our own bodies ( cir-culation of blood , nerve impulses ) , as well as of the atomic structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes displeasing , painful or destructive ? but only in a very few cases can any of them be regarded as caused by human effort or choice . Some of the motions of our own bodies can be redirected by our own wills ; and the motions of bicycles , automobiles , air-planes , and motors of all kinds can also be influenced by human volition . But in every instance of motion there must be some ob-jective " movable " ? even when our will initiates or guides or controls the " movable . " From these facts it is inferred that there is a non-volitional and nonexperiential source of motion . Briefly stated , the argument so far runs : Motion never is wholly dependent on our will , and often is wholly independent of it . Therefore the source of motion is " realistic . " ( ii ) Motion reveals interceptions in visual space . If there were space objects without experience of motion , the third dimension might ( as Berkeley thought ) forever be unknown . But we actually experience motion . What happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not they move ) to become temporarily unseen . The hand placed in front of the eyes conceals all other objects ; the closing of the eyelids does so even more effectively . The flying bird // hides part of the sky or tree . These interceptions of vision suggest realism ; that is , they suggest an order of moving space-objects ex-ternal to , and independent of , experience and causing the phenom-ena in question . ( iii ) The fact of measurement also points toward realism . Ex-periences of sound and color , for example , are observable in the shining present . But as long as they are contemplated as they occur in experience , they may be admired , and they may be used , but they can not be understood . They can be understood scientifically only when they are related to measurements of the motion of sound waves or light waves . These waves obviously are not given in any human shining present , but are conceived as properties of the il-luminating ( or sounding ! ) absent . Since the measurements apply primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that the objects measured are not only absent from his experience and from the social experience of all of us human beings , but also from all possible experience , human or cosmic . In order for measurement to be possible , there must be something that can be measured . If the measurements are to be constant ( as science requires ) , there must be ( iv ) something permanent . Now , the shining present does not seem to be permanent . While it is continuous as long as it endures , its continuity is interrupted by unconsciousness produced by accidents , diseases , or drugs , and by periods of unconsciousness when experience in the usual sense seems to be absent , as in dreamless sleep . Yet normal experience can be usually resumed ( except in death ? which raises the problem of immortality ) . This suggests to the realist a permanent cause of experience which lies beyond experience . He ordinarily calls this a substance ? whether soul substance or material substance . A further consideration , logical and methodological in nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object , whether in the shining present or in the absent , be subjected to a complete analysis , the analysis will result in absolutely simple entities which are never found in any shining present . Such " absents " are not mental in nature , but neither do they have any of the properties of matter.l " The simple entities ( namely , points and instants ) at which analysis arrives are therefore called neutral entities ? dependent neither on ( mental ) experience nor on matter for their being . Experience and matter // are regarded as complexes of neutral entities . Motion , specifically , is a complex of correlations between instants of time and points of space . Since motion involves time and space , and since ( vi ) time and space seem illimitable , " the ordinary man is psychologically dis-posed to deem the source of motion as beyond all shining presents in the vastness of infinity . He is thus led either to an agnostic realism , in which thought is benumbed or overawed , or to a natural-istic realism in which the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such are some of the chief considerations that have led " the man on the street " and " the scientist " to favor the metaphysical con-clusions of the realist. 6 . EVALUATION OF THE TRUTH IN REALISTIC VIEW The realistic view of motion would not be so widely accepted by great thinkers , as well as by the common man , were there not both plausibility and some degree of truth in the position . Let us now try to extract that truth , considering in turn each of the arguments summarized above . That ( i ) motion is not usually a product of human will or choice is indeed true , but this truth does not necessarily entail a realistic conclusion about the objective nature or cause of motion . Motion is indeed not merely human experience or human will . Coherent thought about motion-experiences requires the supposition of an " absent " and continuous source of the motion we commonly ob-serve . But does the objectivity of motion afford coherent ground for assuming it to be a " realistic " ( unexperiencing and unexperienced ) entity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is convenient for science . But is it more coherent with experience than the idealistic assumption that all motion is the energizing of a cos-mic Experient for whom all energy is analogous to what we expe-rience as will ? Let us see . To say the least , the " other " which we infer when our objects move may be an other will than ours . ' To assume that the " other " ( the illuminating absent ) is never present in any experience , and independent of all experients ( as consistent realism requires ) , is to // fly so far into the realm of the transcendent as to make the connec-tion between the transcendent and experients unintelligible . We are led to wonder how verification or confirmation of such a hy-pothesis becomes possible . Indeed , we end up with the curious result that this invented world is more real than any world we actually experience . This invented world of unconscious motions may , perhaps , be real ; but it is not so empirical , not so coherent with experience , and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all objective motion and all objective reality are the activity of a cosmic Experient who interacts with finite experients . The " real " motion would indeed be no less real because it consists in the energizing of a cosmic Will . The motion we experience is the same motion , but its source is more coherently conceived and un-derstandable as the form taken by the action of another Experient in interaction with us . " The argument from ( ii ) experienced interceptions in a world of moving spatial objects proves , of course , that kinetic experience is subject to laws . But the mere fact that these same laws ( or at least the principle of interception ) obtain in dreams and in imaginary worlds is a sufficient proof that the experience of interception does not necessarily entail a " realistic " order of motions for its explana-tion . A time-space-motion order other than any human shining present is , of course , required by both realism and idealism . But no empirical or rational necessity precludes this order 's being the complex consciousness of a cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , to violate the law of parsimony . Nevertheless , realists assert the truth that the order of motion is an illuminating absent , objective to all experients . The argument for realism from ( iii ) measurement points to a well-verified scientific truth . But this truth is metaphysically neu-tral . It is compatible , of course , with realism ; it is compatible with positivism ; it is compatible with idealism , which posits a cosmic Mind that is , among other things , a " great mathematician " ( in the oft-quoted words of Sir James Jeans ) . The need for ( iv ) the permanence of a source or cause of motion is a genuine need of coherent thought about experience . If nothing // is permanent , then there is nothing by which to measure motion and nothing to which it can be related . Without some permanence , not only measurement , but reason itself is impossible . To reply that the principles of reason and mathematics are permanent , but all else flows , is insufficient . Questions remain : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless there is some-thing constant to be reasoned about ? How can there be constant laws of nature if there is no constancy in nature ? It is reasonable to suppose that the source of constancy and per-manence must be such as to be compatible with motion and change . Experience of the shining present is itself a realm of being in which motion and other forms of change are inseparably combined with the experience of unity , memory , and self-identification . This ex-perience fulfills all the conditions necessary for substance , except that of uninterrupted continuity . The shining present of a self , then , must be a dependent , not an independent , substance . But it contains a clue to what independent substance would be ? namely , a truly continuous Self-Experience , of a quality to be carefully de-fined , a coherent object of rational belief ? a truly illuminating absent.20 To sum up , realism is right in its suggestion that there is sub-stance other than any human experient . This substance , whether one or many , is an object of coherent thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophers other than pure solipsists of the present moment21 will be , to some extent , epistemic realists ( or epistemic dualists ) .22 But an epistemic realist may find " ontic " realism ? the realism that involves assertion of impersonal , unconscious being of some sort ? to be incoherent with the facts of experience , unverifi-able , and fancifully inventive . A personalist , then , is an epistemic realist since he holds that his knowledge refers to , and holds for , being beyond his state of knowing . But , since he holds that the nature of the object beyond his knowledge-state is never nonmen-tal , he parts with the metaphysical realists and becomes an ontic or metaphysical idealist . When a realist emphasizes ( v ) analysis , he is emphasizing a valid method , necessary to mathematics , to science , and to practical con152 PERSON AND REALITY trol of experience on any large scale . Analysis is as essential to the housewife in the kitchen , who must know the proper ingredients for the food she is preparing , as it is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter is simply more refined ; that of the mathematician and logician still more so . Realists and " analytical philosophers " are certainly right in their insistence on analysis , and no philosopher should spurn their contribution . Romanticists and even some idealists have unfortunately sometimes neglected or even rejected the method of analysis . The depreciation of analysis is not only unfair to the great con-tributions of science and of realists , but it is unfair to idealism itself . An idealist is one who believes that the whole universe is mind or minds . He ought , then , to be the first to recognize and appropriate the truth that analysis is an act of mind , a necessary stage of its development , and a discovery , in and by the shining present , of truths which apply to the illuminating absent ? such as its atomic structure . However , as already suggested in this book , analysis is not the only valid method of investigation , but is rather an arbitrary limitation on thought , being only a part truth . No thought is adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no experience can be completely understood merely in terms of its parts . The point where idealists and realists part company is not in the acceptance or rejection of analysis . Both accept analysis . The point of difference lies rather in their respective evaluation of synopsis . Synopsis is the grasping of wholes and their properties.23 Idealists contend that knowledge of reality must include at least ( i ) an ac-count of the shining present from which knowledge starts , ( ii ) anal-yses of that present , ( iii ) hypotheses about the absent , ( iv ) analyses of the absent , ( v ) observations of properties of wholes ( present or absent ) which are more than sums of the analyzed parts , and ( vi ) establishing of relations between the observed properties of wholes and the parts known by analysis . Realists tend to neglect ( i ) and to deny or explain away ( v ) and ( vi ) . A homely illustration will serve to bring out the point at issue . Let us suppose a housewife to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances of the dough ; she has placed the dough for the lower crust in the pie-tin , the filling ? raw apples and other ingredients ? over it , and the dough for the upper crust over the filling . She now places this pasty-looking , ill-tasting combination // in the oven . After due time , she removes it ? and it has been changed ! No part of it looks as before ; no part of it tastes as before . Raw ingredients ana dough have become something new , apple pie . What is certain about this result is twofold : ( 1 ) without the ingredients there would have been no pie baked , and ( 2 ) the ingredients did not include the taste , the odor , or the appearance of baked pie . Regardless of any theory of secondary qualities , something is in the total product that was not in the parts . The whole has new properties that did not exist in the parts or in the heat of baking . Here is a foreshadowing of " creative evolution . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human body . All of its parts ( largely water ) may be exhibited in bottles in a drugstore window and priced at about $1.00 . But the life of the body is far more than the sum of these parts . Even more truly does this apply to a mind . To know all of the sensations and other " elements " of a person 's consciousness is not to understand the person . His mind as a whole , its choices and action , its reasonings and its confusions , constitute a whole that is more than its parts . Nothing from pie to person can be fully understood in terms of analysis alone . The realistic argument from ( vi ) the vastness of space and time is hardly a serious one . It is true that the vastness of the real is psychologically impressive and sublime . But to use this vastness as an argument for realism is unfair . Even so acute a thinker as J. B. Pratt ( in discussion ) argued against idealism on the ground that it would require " a very busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize that this is an immensely busy universe and that a God who was not and could not be " very busy " would not be thinkable either as a ground of reality or as an object of worship for all humanity . Metaphysics and religion alike require a union of complexity and simplicity ? of change and permanence . Realism and idealism concur in their acknowledgment of the finite-infinite implications of the shining present and of the motions which it experiences and knows . 7 . EVALUATION OF THE TRUTH IN THE PERSONALISTIC VIEW In closing our discussion of time , space , and motion , let us summarize the positive considerations favorable to a personalistic metaphysics of these categories ? which , incidentally , have been the favored categories of materialism . We have shown that the arguments for realism are all susceptible to a personalistic inter154 PERSON AND REALITY pretation . To be explicit , it includes all the experiences and the reasonings that support realism , but in a wider , more synoptic , more coherent context . 7a . Its inclusiveness . The fundamental argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent to no reduction of the evidence found in the shining present . They insist that no philosophy can set aside or disregard any fact found in personal experience . They therefore welcome all the results of the sciences ? all experiments , all exact observations , and all verified hypotheses . And they insist that nonscientific experiences also be considered ? all moral commitments , all aesthetic values , all acts of worship ? and be treated as data for philosophy . As applied to motion , the personalistic theory is , first of all , the observation that all motion is empirically the conscious experience of changes in consciously experienced relations of space objects at different times . It also includes the hypothesis that all experienced motion is related to the motion experiences of a cosmic Experient . The experience of this cosmic Person includes not only all the order of motions which constitutes what we call nature , but also the objective order to which universals and value experiences refer . The personalistic theory rejects nothing to which experience testifies ; it adds nothing which is incoherent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph has involved a point which should now be made explicit . Personalists lay claim to suggesting the most empirical philosophy , on the ground that they include in experience all types of consciousness ? values and universals , reasonings , and experiences of personal unity , as well as sensations . Little more than prejudice has reduced experience to sensation , and an arbitrary use of language has introduced into philosophical tradition a sharp cleavage between experience and reason . There are , it is empirically evident , many different kinds of experience , complexly interrelated . Sensing is not the same as reasoning , valuing is not the same as describing , choosing is not the same as hoping . But all of these processes do occur in the unity of one shining present , and therefore they are all experiences , however different they may be from each other . Reasoning is as truly an experience as is sensing . It may be contrasted with sensing , as one kind of experience with another ; but experience has as its contradictory not reasoning , but nonexperience ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience ? this insistence that experiences actually constitute a Unitas multiplex ? makes personalism , // one suggests , the most richly and radically empirical philosophy in existence . There are those who restrict experience to what occurs when persons are studied in scientific laboratories . The experience of persons so studied is , however , greatly reduced usually by the " controls " exercised , although , in certain areas , also greatly intensified . To make experience consist solely in such experiencing is to be only partially empiricist . Personalists are total empiricists , requiring evaluation of the whole evidence of the total shining present , whether this be discoverable within the controls of the laboratory or not . This does not mean that the personalist would open the floodgates to uncritical observation , but it does mean that he is critical of any view which arbitrarily confines " experience " to some favored part ? no matter what the purpose is , scientific or religious or aesthetic . 7c . Its interpretation of interaction and communication . Personalists , we have said , propose a hypothesis about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rationally warranted . All philosophers will agree that our world is in some sense a world of interacting beings and that the world contains persons who communicate with each other . Interaction ? the thesis that the various beings in the world act on each other ? is a postulate without which scientific law and experiment would be impossible . Communication is that form of interaction by which two minds are able to inform each other of some of their thoughts , purposes , and feelings . To deny that some of the experiences in the shining present are communications is to deny any rational account of conversations , letters , telephone and telegraph messages , newspapers and books ? all of which occur as claims of communication . There has never appeared the slightest reason to doubt this claim , in principle . The most skeptical philosophers are often the most communicative . They can not state their views without acknowledging both communication and interaction . The fact of interaction is , however , far from being an adequate theory . It is true that interaction must always relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between self and its environment can never be experienced directly . We sit at the telephone , experience " words spoken to us , " and believe ( without experiencing directly ) that there are telephone receivers and wires and a person speaking to us . Interaction and communication rest on perceptions in the shining present , but require support from reasoning to warrant our belief in the communicating other and the nature of his communication . // The personalist theory of interaction is twofold . Negatively , it is the hypothesis that there is no reason to suppose that an impersonal and unconscious being ( if there were any such ) could act on , or communicate with , a conscious being . Positively it is the hypothesis that , since interaction and communication are necessary assumptions , the whole of reality is a realm of conscious selves or shining presents . Once more , the personalist would be both inclusive and empirical in suggesting such a view . We know ourselves on the basis of immediate experience . When we know others , we have to assume that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , on the one hand , that consciousness can communicate with consciousness . This belief is intensified by accumulating evidence for telepathy , clairvoyance , and extrasensory perception . On the other hand , the contentions of realists , whether they proposed a dualistic or pluralistic realm of unconscious beings , have caused puzzles and difficulties about interaction from Descartes to Ryle . The attempt to resolve these difficulties has resulted either in appeals to paradox ( as in the " pineal gland " ) or to magic ( they do interact , although we can not understand how ) , or to denial either of an objective order ( by solipsism ) or of a subjective order ( by behaviorism ) . Affirmation of at least a relatively intelligible interaction of objective and subjective seems to be restricted to idealistic views . On the personalistic view , motion is a communication from a cosmic Mind to a society of human minds , a communication which , of course , is variously understood by those minds . All communications need interpretation . On the personalistic view the " how " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views , but the mystery is decreased by conceiving of it as operating between minds , and specifically between finite minds and cosmic Mind upon which they depend for their being and continuance . 7d . Its theory of privacy and publicity . Personalism has the further advantage of solving the problem of privacy and publicity . All experience is first-personal ; all occurs in a shining present ; all is in that sense private . But since persons are similar in structure by virtue of their dependence on , and interaction with , an objective cosmic Experient , and since the principle of reason is the same in all , true private reasoning about private experience can be communicated and verified by others . We are better able to understand how a public world of time , space , and motion can be discovered through private experiences , if the hypothesis of personalism is true . For we are now not faced with the difficulties of an ultimate // pluralism , which never explains how community and order in inter-action come about . That order of interaction is made possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure and activity of the cosmic Experient upon whom finite experients depend and with whom they are in constant interaction . Is this less intelligible than the relatively blind assertion : There is interaction in Nature ? 7e . It does not claim " necessity . " Is the personalistic account of time , space , and motion inconsistent with experience and with sci-ence ? Our suggestion is that it affords a coherent , systematic , and interrelated view of human fact . However , this sort of rational adequacy is not absolute proof . To lay claim to absolute proof in any metaphysical matter is to claim perfect and complete reasoning about a complete knowledge of all experience . For any thinker to make such a claim is to display absurd intellectual arrogance . Yet , does not personalism try , in offering its hypothesis , to be more in-clusive and more empirical than many types of philosophy try to be ? Is it not more systematic in its concrete empirical correlations than any purely abstract reasoning could be ? Does it not in par-ticular seem to be more empirical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one is unempirical in slight-ing the personal unity of experience , and the other even more reductive in its restriction to " physicalism " ? Caveat lector . Let him suspend judgment until further evidence is in . Chapter 9 CAUSE 1 . REORIENTATION TOWARD THE CATEGORIES The categories were treated in a preliminary , but not systematic , fashion in Chapter 6 . Having considered some of the more obvious categories ? time , space , motion ? we are now ready for a reorientation before another category is discussed . Starting with the definition of a category as a principle essential to the very being of some universe of discourse , investigation led to the conclusion that time is a category of all that is found in any shining present , while space and motion are categories restricted to sensory observation . Fundamental to our total argument is the critical discovery that reasoning and knowledge , themselves data of the shining present , always refer beyond themselves to illuminating absents . And various reasons have appeared for believing that all illuminating absents to which the categories refer are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting the philosophy of personal idealism , or idealistic personalism , have emerged as a result of the application of the criterion of empirical coherence to experience . It must be repeated that neither the categories nor their application to beings in illuminating absents can be said to be logically necessary . Not a single item in the content of experience is logically necessary . Specifically , there is no purely logical reason why there Should be anything at all ; certainly there is no logical necessity that there be either time or space or motion . Time is a universal category ? yes , but only if there is experience . If there is no experience , there are no categories . Certainly there is no logical necessity of a category ( or " form " in Kant 's sense ) of three-dimensional space . As modern geometries have proved , any number of spatial dimensions from one to infinity is logically thinkable . Categories , then , are as truly dependent on experience as experience is on categories ; and neither experience nor its categories can be taken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justified 158 // discoveries ; they are revealed in experience and tested by empirical coherence . But they are not logical in the sense of a purely abstract logic ( either Aristotelian or symbolic ) to which the empirical de-tails of experience are irrelevant . ) Just as the categories are not purely logical , so also they are not purely empirical , in the traditional sense . No category can be dis-covered from sense data alone . Nor is any principle to be deemed a category simply if it can be shown by empirical investigation to be inherited rather than acquired . The whole discussion about nativism is of no importance at all for the theory of categories . There is no necessary relation between the proposition : X is " in-herited " ( or " instinctive " ) and X is a category . Fear of falling is doubtless inherited and instinctive , but it is not a category in any broad or philosophical sense . What , then , has our actual empirical analysis brought forth ? Time is the only category which , thus far , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are there other such categories ? In this chapter reasons will be shown for regarding cause as another such category . Yet it will turn out to be more ambiguous and com-plex than time itself , puzzling as it has been to thinkers of all ages . We shall continue our search for comprehensive and adequately metaphysical categories , by analysis of the various realms of being given in and required by the shining present . As has been more than hinted in these first pages , it may turn out that the most concrete and inclusive category is that of person . Already grounds for this conclusion have been suggested . If this should be true , then it would follow : no person , no existence , either actual or possible ? as Whitehead thinks is true of his actual occa-sions . It would then be the case that " personal " would be a synonym of actual or possible ; and " impersonal " would mean " nonsense , " the inconceivable and impossible ( logically speaking ) . Otherwise " im-personal " could be used to mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or else " some being in personal experience considered without reference to its full context " ( philosophically speaking ) . Neither of these uses of " impersonal " would conflict with a personalistic metaphysics , for an impersonal order does not necessarily entail a nonmental order .
