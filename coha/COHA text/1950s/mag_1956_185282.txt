In Italy the income-tax law is about as popular , and as enforceable , as Prohibition used to be in the U.S. Out of 47 million Italians , barely a million admit to any taxable income at all ; of the million , only a handful admit to making more than 5,000,000 lire ( $8,000 ) a year . In 1954 Gina Lollobrigida , one of Italy 's most conspicuous assets , reported an income of but $4,800 . The tax collectors ' estimate of her income : $40,000 . When Textile Manufacturer Gaetano Marzotto once owned to an income of $704,000 , Rome 's Il Tempo suggested that " statues be built to him and piazzas named in his honor . " <P> Four years ago , Finance Minister Ezio Vanoni created a stir by requiring all Italians to make out annual tax returns . Roberto Tremelloni , Finance Minister in the Scelba government , went even further . Tremelloni introduced a bill which would for the first time 1 ) require an oath in making out . returns , and 2 ) exact penalties for defrauding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it resisted by Neo-Fascists and Monarchists , but it was repellent to the big-money backers of the ruling Christian Democrats . The bill languished in committee until one day last month , when Fellow Traveler Pietro Nenni , freshly returned from imbibing political wisdom in <P> Moscow , proclaimed a change in strategy . Nenni Socialists and their Communist allies would henceforth be willing to support " progressive legislation . " With that , Tremelloni 's bill was hauled out of committee and put to the vote . <P> The prospect of having to declare either for it or against it produced a severe case of stay-at-home-itis among the Deputies . <P> Ex-Premiers Mario Scelba and Giuseppe Pella absented themselves along with almost a third of their Christian Democrat followers . Of the 68 Monarchists and Neo-Fascists , only 13 were in the Chamber last week when the Tremelloni bill finally passed , 315 to 47 . Well over 200 of the favorable votes were cast by the Communists and Nenni Socialists . <P> Next day , in pique , Rome 's biggest moneymen went on strike against tax reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance Ministry explained sympathetically , " Italians can not be made to accept the idea of sending a man to jail for failure to pay taxes .
