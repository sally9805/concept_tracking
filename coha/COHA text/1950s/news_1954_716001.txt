txt WASHINGTON , Jan. 18 ? President Eisenhower will ask Congress for authority to use up to $1,000,000,000 worth of Government-owned surplus farm foods and fibers for foreign aid in the next three years as a part of the Administration 's farm program . This was made known today by Ezra Taft Benson , Secretary of Agriculture , as he began before the Senate Agriculture Committee an uphill fight against bipartisan sentiment to put across his farm program ideas . He posed for committee members the question at what point 140,000,000 American consumers Who do not live on farms might rebel against costly farm programs and demand " outright elimination of all direct aid to agriculture . " The stage has been reached in farm price support operations where that " pointed " question and three others must be asked , Mr. Benson said . The others were : SHow far were we prepared to go in making additional billions of dollars available primarily for , the support of a ' few selected ifarm commodities ? What assurance is there that if the Commodity Credit Corpo- , ration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further increases will not be required next year and the year after ? The C. C. C. is the // Government 's price support agent . Its $6,750,000,000 limit is expected to run out by the end of this year because of its commitments under law to support farm products . ( Mow shall we reconcile demands for a balanced budget , lower taxes , less overall government spending and a tight rein on the national debt limitation with heavy farm price support expenditures which give every indication of growing progressively ? Tester ? " Mr. Benson said he did not have the answers to these questions . But he took a shot at critics to the Administration 's plan to shift to a more flexible system of farm price props by saying : " They must be answered by anyone who proposes a continuation , without substantial change , of the present farm program . " Price Plan Opposed The proposals to use $1,000 , - 000,000 of surplus commodities and other surplus disposal plans advanced by the President generally were warmly received by farm state members of Congress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to the flexible price supports . Several Republican committee members , as well as Democrats , told Mr. Benson that lower price supports would only drive farmers to produce more to maintain their current income levels . The flexible system proposed by the President for " basic " commodities now supported a ' : 90 per cent of parity involves a range of 75 to 90 per cent of parity . Parity is defined in Federal law as a " fair " price for a farmer 's product in relation to the cost of things he must buy . The flexible system proposed for the major crops now supoorted at a mandatory 90 per cent of parity  --  cotton , wheat and corn  --  would mean support up to 90 per cent in times of scarcity to encourage output and a lower support down to a floor of 75 per cent in periods of surplus to discourage production . The Secretary of Agriculture , however , would be given authority to increase supports above legal calculations if he deemed it necessary . The Administration adopted the unusual procedure of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Message to Congress to disclose the plan to use $1,000 , - 000,000 of surplus products for foreign aid . The commodities would be used , the President said , " to assist in strengthening the economies of friendly countries , and otherwise contribute to the accomplishment of our foreign policy objectives . " Surplus Held by C. C. C. He said the budget for the 1905 ? - Scal year , starting next July Vwould seek a supplemental appropriation of $.300,000000 , to reimburse the C. C. C. for'itunmodities used . Only C. C. C. stocks will be used . Supplies for the program will come from the $2 , - 500,000,000 worth of surplus stocks that the President proposed sealing off for foreign aid , emergency cr stockpilin , disaster relief and the Federal-state school lunch program . " This program , " the President said , was " designed to complement our general program of economic and tehcnical development and must be closely coordinated with it . " " It should be emphasized , " he continued , " in connection with this program that it is purely temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not involve the continued accumulation of large surpluses . " Special safeguards will be provided which will require that commodities furnished must be in addition to amounts which otherwise would have been imported and must not displace the usual marketing of the United States and friendly countries . " The President now has authority under Section 550 of the Mutual Security Act to use up to $250,000,000 in surplus farm products for aid abroad . Secretary BensOn reported that latest figures of the Department of Agriculture showed $5,400 , - 000,000 tied up in surplus commodities . This was divided $2,500 , - 000.000 owned outright by the Government and loans outstanding on various crops of approximately $3,000.000,000. - Secretary Benson was challenged by three Republican and three Democratic committeemen on his 3,000-word statement to the Senate committee . Two Republicans and one Democrat supported him . Republican Senators Milton R. young of North Dakota , one of the secretary 's most vocal critics ; Karl E. Mundt of South Dakota , and Edward J. Thye of Minnesota questioned the feasibility of a flexible price system . They were - joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority member of the group , Clyde R. Hoey of North Carolina , and Olin D. Johnston of South Carolina . The Democrats - contended that present high supports were workable so long as strict production controls were invoked to prevent piling up surpluses . , Senators Mundt and Thye questioned whether flexible price supports would bring , about . shifts in production , from products , in surplus to ' commodities in short supply , as Mr. Benson contended . " What will you shift into ? " Senator Thye inquired , adding that most commodities , except hogs , were in abundant supply already . Mr. Benson was supported by Senators Clinton P. Anderson , Democrat of New Mexico and former ? ecretary of Agriculture , and Republicans George D. Aiken of Vermont , committee phairman , and Bourke B. Hickenlooper of Iowa . Senator Hickenlooper asserted there had been " false interpretations " of flexible supports and congratulated Mr. Benson fpr his " courageous approach " to the farm issue . Senator Johnston said that if mandatory high supports on major crops were eliminated , Hmillions of small farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that approximately 2,000,000 farmers benefited from price supports while 3,500,000 farmers " do not receive any great benefit because they do n't sell much .
