The 20th Century has a characteristic unique in history - the headlong , accelerating growth of scientific knowledge . The curve of knowledge is exponential , growing steeper like the curve of squares ( 1-4-9-16-25-36-49 . . . ) . It has changed men 's lives more in the past 20 years than in the previous 50 ; more in that 50 years than in the previous 200 . Man can not , dare not stop its growth , though he does not know where it is taking him . <P> The most startling discoveries came in the last 50 years , and they were made when many scientists had decided that the age of discovery was about over . <P> Orderly World . To the grave , sedate scientists of the late 19th Century , the physical world seemed almost as orderly as Queen Victoria 's garden parties . Its byways held a few shadows still , but these most scientists were sure would soon be lightened . <P> The physicists of those days believed that the universe was built foursquare on Newton 's Laws of Motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was matter , they stated dogmatically . It could , of course , be used in combustion to release energy , but matter itself could not be turned into energy . The chemical elements were indestructible ; no atom of one could be transmuted into an atom of another . The scientists were confident that if they applied such well-known rules with greater &; greater precision , they could eventually explain everything in the universe . Few of them suspected , and fewer dared suggest , that the basic rules might be wrong . <P> With hindsight it is plain to modern scientists that classical physics was dodging issues . It had nothing to say about X rays ( discovered by Rntgen in 1895 ) or about radioactivity ( Becquerel , 1896 ) . Yet these were no small shadow patches . They were signposts pointing to a new world of knowledge . <P> Frivolous Jumps . In the neatly appropriate year of 1900 , a discovery was made that was to knock the props from under classical physics . In his Berlin laboratory , Max Planck , a 42-year-old German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light by glowing bodies . No one had done it and Planck could not do it either-until , in a sort of desperation , he assumed that light does not flow in a smooth stream , as everyone supposed , but in tiny , indivisible bursts . <P> At the time this was frivolity , almost like saying that a railroad train moves in one-foot jumps . But as soon as Planck made his daring assumption , his equations came to heel , describing the emission of radiant energy with elegant precision . <P> Here was something important , but Planck did not realize it . For years he worked to eliminate the frivolous jumps of energy . They refused to get out of the picture ; when Planck made light flow smoothly , his equations would not work . At last he accepted the jumps as actually existing . He named them " quanta " and found that they vary in size with the frequency of the light . Then he wrote his famous equation . Said Planck : " One quantum of energy equals ' h ' times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
