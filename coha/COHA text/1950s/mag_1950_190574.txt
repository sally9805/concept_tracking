PARADE 'S END ( 836 pp. - Ford Madox Ford-Knopf ( $5 ) . <P> <P> In the making of a literary reputation , as in most other enterprises , it pays to advertise . Many writers ( e.g. , Bernard Shaw , William Saroyan ) do much of the advertising themselves : each time their talents burst into flower they let off such chesty bugle notes of self-satisfaction that only the coldest , boldest critic dares to play deaf . But there are other good writers who bloom in silence , leaving it to the critics to sniff them out , though it may take years to place them in their proper niches . <P> The late Ford Madox Ford was just such a neglected writer . He was the son of the London Times 's erudite German music critic , Dr. Francis Hueffer ( the son changed his surname to Ford after World War I ) , as well as a grandson of Victorian Painter Ford Madox Brown and a cousin of the Rossetti family . A precocious schoolboy , he began writing while still in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only noise he was likely to make would be in praise of others . <P> By the time he was 25 , Ford was helping struggling Polish Immigrant Joseph Conrad to proper use of the English language . He wrote with him a novel named Romance-and thereafter paid the penalty of being introduced to strangers as " the man who collaborated with Conrad . " As editor of the English Review , Ford was the first to print poems and stories by the young D. H. Lawrence-and in return for the favor was roundly abused by that ungrateful genius . Later , Expatriates Gertrude Stein , Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passes made their early marks in Ford 's transatlantic review . <P> Ford kept up the steady flow of his own writing-novels , criticism and reminiscence . But after a brief period in the ' 20s , when some of his novels became bestsellers in the U.S. , he sank more &; more into the twilight of Parisian cocktail parties and U.S. college lecture platforms ( " an old man mad about writing , " he once described himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ' 30s , he reminded one student of Tristram Shandy 's garrulous Uncle Toby-a " vast , benevolent and harmless Uncle Toby , leaning on his stick . . . and wheezing out his stories of Henry James as Toby might have spoken of Marlborough . His books seemed to us like medals achieved , perhaps , in the Crimea ; and we read Auden , Kafka , Evelyn Waugh . " <P> Heir of the Ages . This week , eleven years after Ford 's death , many U.S. readers will be getting their first chance at four of his long-forgotten , time-tarnished medals , the novel series Some Do Not . . . , No More Parades , A Man Could Stand Up- , The Last Post , all wrapped up in a single omnibus entitled Parade 's End . Readers will also have a chance of being in on the making of a popular literary reputation , for Ford 's publisher has spared no pains to provide his forgotten man with a general 's escort of trumpeters : " the great English novelist of his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this century more likely to live " ( Graham Greene ) ; " a veritable Kanchenjunga* among the current molehills " ( Herschel Brickell ) .
