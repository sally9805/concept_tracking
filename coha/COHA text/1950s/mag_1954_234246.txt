STATE OF BUSINESS <P> Of all the battlefronts of U.S. business , few are more crucial than construction . Last week the news from the builders was good . Instead of slumping off , construction is climbing at a record rate . First-quarter figures showed expenditures of $7.3 billion , up $108 million over last year . March brought a better-than-seasonal increase of $2.5 billion in contracts for new buildings , with highway construction up approximately 35% and total private building increasing by 8% . Reading the figures , construction men revised their earlier forecasts and started thinking of 1954 in terms of a record $36.1 billion year , $1,300,000 better than 1953 's all-time high . <P> Cheering reports also came in from some other important sectors of the economy .

Along Wall Street , the bull market soared higher ( see below ) . The Dow-Jones industrial average jumped to 309.39 , the highest point since Oct. 22 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After holding fairly steady during January , sales began to slip . The March totals dropped 2% below February and 5% below March 1953 . Mail-order houses announced gloomy figures . Sears , Roebuck sales were down 12.2% from last year and Montgomery Ward was off 22.8% for the month and 19.4% for both February and March . Retailers explained that mailorder catalogue prices were rigid compared to department stores , said people were beginning to shop around for bargains . <P> Other merchants blamed poor weather and a late Easter week for delaying the usual spring upsurge . They waited anxiously for Easter to come and go , and thought that the first few weeks afterwards would tell the story .
