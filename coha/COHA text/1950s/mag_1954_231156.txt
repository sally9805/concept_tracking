THE TEMPTATIONS OF SAINT ANTHONY <P> Off in the wilderness bare and level , Anthony wrestled with the Devil . Once he 'd beaten the Devil down , Anthony 'd turn his eyes toward town And leave his hermitage now and then To come to grips with the souls of men . <P> Afterwards , all the tales agree , Wrestling the Devil seemed to be Quite a relief to Anthony . <P> <P> LESSON FOR BEGINNERS <P> Martin of Tours , <P> When he earned his shilling <P> Trooping the flags <P> Of the Roman Guard <P> Came on a poor <P> Aching and chilling <P> Beggar in rags <P> By the barracks yard . <P> Blind to his lack , The Guard went riding . But Martin a moment Paused and drew The coat from his back , His sword from hiding , And sabered his raiment Into two . <P> Now some who muse On the allegory Affect to find It a pious joke ; To the beggar what use , For Martin what glory In deed half-kind And part of a cloak ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizing . <P> For all who move <P> In the mortal sun <P> Know halfway warm <P> Is better than freezing <P> As half a love <P> Is better than none . <P> <P> MOTHER OF THE SAINT <P> Gossiping in Siena 's square , <P> The housewife , Lapa , used to say , " My Catherine has yellow hair <P> Like the True Princess in the play . <P> Sure as it 's June that follows May , Our Kate was born to be a belle . <P> The girl 's a clever one , and gay , I plan for her to marry well . " <P> Lapa had hopes , would not despair . <P> " The young ones always fast and pray , A season , " Lapa would declare . " This holy nonsense does not stay . " <P> Though all Siena thronged to pay Homage to Catherine in her cell , <P> Stubbornly Lapa bragged away , " I plan for her to marry well . " <P> They pressed from nations everywhere , <P> Poet , prince , prelate , common clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Their feet were clamorous night and day . <P> She saw the very Pope obey The summons Catherine scarce could spell <P> And muttered , " What 's a slight delay ? I plan for her to marry well . " <P> Still muttered as the world turned gray , <P> " How pretty her hair was ! Who could tell That things would go so far astray ? <P> I planned for her to marry well . " <P> <P> THE THUNDERER <P> God 's angry man , His crotchety <P> scholar <P> Was Saint Jerome , The great name-caller Who cared not a dime For the laws of libel And in his spare time Translated the Bible . Quick to disparage All arts but learning , Jerome liked marriage Better than burning But did n't like woman 's Painted cheeks ; Did n't like Romans , Did n't like Greeks , Hated Pagans For their Pagan ways , Yet doted on Cicero all his days . <P> A born reformer , cross and gifted , <P> He scolded mankind <P> Sterner than Swift did ; <P> Worked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a cave <P> For peace to breathe in , <P> Promptly wherewith <P> For miles around <P> He filled the air with <P> Fury and sound . <P> In a mighty prose , <P> For almighty ends , <P> He thrust at his foes , <P> Quarreled with his friends , <P> And served his Master <P> Though with complaint . <P> He was n't a plaster sort of saint .
