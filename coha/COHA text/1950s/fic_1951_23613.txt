? Home A Story by Kay Boyle ? ow it was evening , and the rain had been falling all day , falling steadily on the ruins and rubble of the city , and . the wind had been driving in hard from the outlying hills . It was the time of day to turn toward home , and a sadness seemed to fall , with the rain , upon the city streets , as if , at this hour , the entire city had come quietly to recognize the reason for its physical destruction , and the burden of its nearly unatonable sin . People whose daily work was done moved out of the doorways of the half-broken buildings , the shop-blinds descended , shuddering aloud , and the ferment of sale and barter came to a close . The streetcars came , riding the weather as a ship rides the sea , so filled with dark , clinging forms that they no longer stopped for those who waited , but rocked on toward the outskirts of the German city , their bells clanging out in warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come uptown as far as the American Shopping Center that the grief and longing which beset the city seemed to be assuaged . Here the Army Post Exchange , and the Clothing Store , and the Coffee Shop , with its ice-cream soda fountain , were emblazoned with neon lights , and music came through amplifiers planted , like giant convolvuluses , in the roof garden 's illuminated shrubbery . There were elegant cars parked cheek by jowl still in the cemented drive before the buildings , for it was Wednesday , and the Shopping Center closed an hour later on that day . The whole place was set aside from ordinary life by seeded triangles ofgrass , bordered by hedges , and these and the shrubbery seemed artificially colored , but it was the rain and the floodlights which had painted them in phony green . Here there was the constant , insouciant fluxing of the civilian and the military  --  the dependent children in their Gene Autry outfits , with rodeo holster and pistol sets strapped at their waists , and the groups of blue-jeaned high-school students passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the cleavage of any Stateside town . Or there were the dependent wives in long , vividly colored , mail-order coats , with the plaid-lined hoods of them covering their silky hair , walking under the rain with their husbands in uniform beside them , the captains and majors and colonels carrying five-cent paper shopping bags by their string handles as they pushed in and out of the bright , fanning doors . While through the amplifiers which yawned above their heads in this alien country , a voice they had known since time began sang the familiar words of love aloud to them , keeping the sound of Germany away . B UT there were men alone among these others , GIs come this far from barracks in the streetcars or by jeep , on a Wednesday evening , boys from the Southern states , or from the North , or from the West , or from the East , some with black skins and some with white , come for the sake of a Coke , or a banana-split , or for the familiar layout of a newsstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks , in the stalls of the " Wile-U-Wait " shoe-repair salon , to close their eyes , and dream there as they waited for new Catspaw heels to be affixed ; come in loneliness to this lighted island which could not be accepted as home , but which might be taken for a little while as home 's facsimile . One of these was a colored GI from Mississippi , with a month 's pay in his pocket , who walked quickly toward the show windows of the Clothing Store , with his head lowered into the springtime wind . It was the presence of someone waiting in the shadows of the building which stopped him as abruptly as if the darkness had pronounced his name . " Why , hello , " he said , and he lingered there , his hands thrust into his pockets out of the wet , his eyes seeking to make out the figure through the rain and the obscurity . " Hi , there , " he said , speaking softly , as man might have said it to woman in his loneliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . The soldier stepped closer to the border hedge , and he leaned across the budding twigs of it , and now he could see that the creature who waited there was no larger than a child , a child perhaps stricken to immobility and silence by the amplified music , and the hastening people , and by the neon lights which spelled their indecipherable message out . " What you think you doing out on a night like this one ? " he said , and the child , or the dwarf , or whatever it was that had taken shelter there , took the four or five intervening steps across the triangle of slipping , unseen mud , and made its way expertly through the brittle hedge . When it stood beside him on the pavement , the soldier laid his hand gently , in diffidence , on its shoulder , and he drew it forward with him toward the show windows of the Clothing Store . And there , in the two great golden squares of light cast out , he saw that his fingers touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across the bare flesh of a boy of four or five . " You sure got yourself good and wet all over , " the soldier said , and he paused , hesitant a moment , before looking shyly into the boy 's face , perhaps fearing the record of want and hunger that might be written there . " Kalt , " the little boy said , and he looked up at the soldier , his cheeks as full and firm as a baby 's cheeks , and a look of impudence , of humor , in his long-lashed , lively eyes . " You got no call to be cold this time of year , " the soldier said , but here , out of the shelter of the building , he too felt the wind driving sharply in upon them from the springtime hills . He could feel the good covering of flesh on the boy 's bones , for the clothes the boy Ivore were as thin as paper , and the bones under the covering of flesh were shaking in the soldier 's hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'd take a month to dry you out . That 's all the matter with you . You just needs to get in where it 's dry , " the soldier said , and he looked around for a couple of other words to say , but he could n't find them , for he had come only a few weeks before to this country , and the language of home was the only one that made any sense at all . H E KEPT one hand on the boy 's shoulder , and like this they walked into the light of the entrance-way together , walked with the high-school girls , and the dependent wives , and the military , toward where a German girl , with an official beribboned badge pinned on her blouse , stood checking civilians at the swinging door . It may have been that she did not see beyond the soldier 's uniform , and , seeing it , she did not put the question ; or it may have been that , in the fluxing tide of women and men , ? she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once inside , the boy and the soldier stood motionless together , drawn suddenly apart from all the others , and , in his uneasiness , the soldier took his leather-beaked cap from the black curls on his head . Beyond hung a mirror , and , when the tide of white people parted , the soldier saw himself , tall , gaunt , chalk-eyed , separated not only by his color from these others , but by his own perplexity ; and then , as if recalling that he had been lent a temporary dignity by the uniform he wore , he put his cap quickly back upon his head again . He stood holding to the shoulder of the German boy , seeking to get his bearings in the confusion , to steer a course between the display of nylon nightgowns , and the Roy Rogers sweaters in primal colors , and the gaudily striped ties ; while the others , with purpose and destination established in them , passed from counter to counter , come here for something they knew the size and shape and terms of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right ones , not come for the sake of warmth or light or an illusion of security . In the full-length panel of the glass , he could see that below the German boy 's raveling sweater hung shrunken cotton pants , and below the pants , ribbed , cotton stockings , black with wet , were twisted on his short , strong legs . But whatever shoes the boy had on his feet , the soldier could not make out , because of the accumulated mud they bore . " You had ought to wiped your feet off before you come in , " the soldier said . The tide of people had closed again before the mirror , and the soldier looked down at the boy , and he saw that the fair hair was not cropped close to his head as he had seen it on the skulls of other German children . but it hung silky and long behind his ears and in his soiled small neck , and strands of it curled up fine and golden across his rain-wet brow . " You Have Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silverware counter , and a wreath of forget-me-nots had been hand-painted around these simple words . " You Have Only One Mother " was written in white , perhaps in soap , in a flowing hand on the three-paneled glass at the lingerie counter , and the striped shower curtains in the Gift Shop Corner bore this same factual statement concerning Mother 's Day . It was the boy 's eye or mind which cleared before the soldier 's , and which singled out of the bright , animate confusion , the portrait of a woman 's thin , somber face . It was framed in pleated gilt paper , and it hung above the hosiery counter , where the stockings were shown drawn over shapely , wooden legs . There were legs which reclined on cushions , and others which did not , and above them meditated the censorious face of someone perhaps as recognizable as Whistler 's mother , only the boy and the soldier had no way of knowing the features either of Whistler 's , or his mother 's , face . " Grossmutter ! " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , and his fingers pulled at the soldier 's sleeve . " Grossmutter ! " he cried , with a kind of humor in it , and he pointed up at the woman with her thin lips and her meekly parted hair . " Well , what d'y ' know ? " said the soldier , and a sense of wonder and pleasure came into his blood.tu , for all their incongruity here , it might have been that the Clothing Store had been expecting them to come , for at the far end of its galleries a special counter had been prepared . Through the flux of shoppers , the soldier saw a pair of child 's size , calf's-hide cowboy boots set on the glass , and a black rubber coat , with a matching fireman 's hat , standing high on the doll-like , smiling model of a boy . " Looks like they 're selling things for boys over there , " the soldier said , and the boy in his raveling sweater moved forward with him , his hand holding to the soldier 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a schoolroom for the moment , taken refuge here from the uproariousness of the young and heedless , and now she straightened the ribbons of the official badge which labeled her one of the chosen , and she settled the pins in her knot of graying hair . " Can I help you ? " she said in her good imitation of American , but the soldier did not seem to see her standing there . Instead , he saw the cowboy boots on the glass pane of the counter , and he picked them up , and he looked at the soles of them , and at the heels , as carefully as if he had stood like this in stores at home with a blond-headed child beside him , and had learned what qualities you had to look for in the shoes that child would wear . " Oh , prima , prima ! " the boy cried out in his eagerness . " Can I show you something ? " the German woman said . Behind her were the shelves with boys ' shirts lying folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corduroys , boys ' pullovers , and boys ' blue jeans , with the smell of their denim , strong , familiar , like the smell of home upon the air . " If He 's Yours , He Deserves the Best , " the slogan was written above the shelves , and the soldier felt his own lips shaping the words of this unprecedented statement , his tongue moving slowly , cautiously , emitting no sound . Then he turned to the raincoat on the model , and his fingertips lifted the hem of it , and he looked at the lining , and then he let it fall , and with his open palm he stroked the fireman 's black , sloping hat . His month 's pay had gone so heavy with promise in his pocket now that he could scarcely bear the weight of it , and when the woman behind the counter spoke to him , he slowly brought himself to hear . " Yes , ma'am , " he said , and he took off his hat before her . And then he remembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 're pretty nice things you got here , ma'am , " he said . It was not until then that he saw the felt slippers the boy had on his feet , with the toes thrusting , pale as putty , through them , having thrust through the ribbed stockings a long time before . " I want the best pair of shoes you got in the store for my little boy here , " he said . Behind the counter was a half-circle of hinged , shoestore seats , and the boy sat tentatively on the edge of the one the saleswoman pulled down for him , and then he slipped off it , and let it clap back into place again . He did this twice , and each time he did it , he looked around , laughing , because of the slaps of sound it made . His hair was drying in the heat of the store , and its color lightening , and his full , babyish cheeks were pressed up until his eyes were almost closed with laughing , and a flush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spoken in English to him , and not until she had sat down before the boy , and put out her hand to take the measurement , did she see the sodden , broken slippers , and her bent body straightened on the shoeclerk 's stool . " Why , this is a German boy . He 's German , " she said , and she looked up in shocked rebuke . " Well , yes , ma'am , " said the soldier . " He 's German . I found him standing outside the door . " " Germans are not allowed to come in here , " the saleswoman said . " Well , maybe neither him nor me 's allowed to come in here , " said the soldier , speaking gently , " but he 's got the right to have shoes on his feet the same as you and me got the right . " N ow that he sat back in this adult seat , the boy 's legs were too short to bend at the knee , and they thrust out straight before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And once the saleswoman had taken his slipper off , and held it in distaste between the forefinger and thumb , the boy began to talk in his high , almost impudentvoice to her , or to anyone who would listen , piping wildly and sweetly of the cowboy boots , it may have been , or the raincoat , or the other things he wanted for his own . But however many elegant , clean pairs of shoes the saleswoman brought out , they would not go onto his feet because of the welts and the wet of the ragged stockings on his legs . " 1 think you 'll have to put dry socks on him first , " the saleswoman said , and she held the new shoes in her hand , her eyes , her very being , withdrawn , making no move to peel his stockings away . " We have some cheap ones , " she said , for she had been chosen by the Americans to serve Americans , and it was to them she gave her allegiance now . " We have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some better ones , " the soldier said . " Maybe you got some that costs more . " The saleswoman got up , and she set the shoes down on the floor , and she turned to study the numbers on the cartons on the shelves . Then she slid out the box marked " 7 , " and she sat down again on the stool before the boy . In the box there were socks with multi-colored stripes , and others with flowered borders , and still others in solid blue , and solid red , and green , and gold . " Ask him what 's his favorite color , ma'am , will you ? " said the soldier , his voice modest and shy . When the saleswoman spoke to the boy in this tongue they shared in common , the bright , quick chattering came to a pause , and then , when she had finished , the boy began to slide back and forth on the hinged wooden seat again , speaking his high , sweet vocabulary of joy . " He says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to anything that they might say or do . " He says he wants them all . " " Well , that 's okay with me . Tell him that 's okay , " the soldier said , and perhaps because he believed there might be some doubt in her mind concerning how much he had , the soldier took the bills of scrip from his pocket , and he began counting them carefully out . But she did n't want the money then ; she wanted something else of him , and , seated there on the stool before the boy , she did not look at the soldier , but in spite of the shame and the broken pride which held and warped her spirit , she could not bring herself to take the rotted , black stockings from the boy 's soiled legs . So the soldier stooped , and he pulled the boy 's stockings off , and now that his feet were naked before them , they saw the inch or more of bleached , spongy flesh which cushioned the soles of the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been frozen some time , " the soldier said . " Maybe not this winter , but a long time ago . But they was certainly frozen some time . Maybe when he was nothing but a baby lying in his crib , " he said , and he held the boy 's feet cradled in his long , dark hands . It was while he picked out the shoes for the boy , and selected the underwear for him , and three bright shirts , and two pairs of blue jeans , and a printed neck-scarf with jewel nail heads and a bucking branch() in the pattern of it , and a nickel slide loop to draw it tight beneath the collar , that the soldier dreamed the brief , clear dream of love about the boy . For the duration of the dream , the boy was his , the authority of family , of country , of occupation even , having discarded him , and the soldier , who had known only leaning Negro shacks , become the provider , the protector at last , the dispenser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the American store now except the three of them , and no sound in their . universe except the shrill , rapid piping of the boy . Then the soldier lifted the calf's-hide boots off the counter again , and he said : " He ought to have these to change to when he 's done got the others wet . " So he put the cowboy boots aside , with the shirts , and the blue jeans , and the underwear , and his fingers returned to the hem and the lining of the raincoat on the smiling pink-faced model of a child . " Maybe you got this in his size , and the hat that comes with it , " the soldier said , but the boy was saying something to the woman . " What 's that boy saying now ? " the soldier said . " He says his mother will be pleased , " said the saleswoman , her voice acrid as she took her sales-pad up . Over the hosiery counter the sign said , " You Have Only One Mother , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the runner above the silverware counter repeated , and Whistler 's mother looked down on them , giving no quarter to man or boy as she eyed them from the pleated gilt paper of her frame . " Would you ask him something for me , ma'am ? " said the soldier , and his fingers on the raincoat ceased to move . " Would you ask him where his mother is ? " he said . T HE boy had got the wet gray sweater off alone , and he was struggling now to get his arms into the red and orange cowboy shirt . When the saleswoman put the question to him , he was doing his best to get the buttons closed . He looked up at her with a marvelous brightness , a singular ' eagerness of lip , and tongue , and eye , but once she had heard his quick , insouciant answer , the woman shook her head . " He says he does n't know where his mother is , " she told the soldier , and then she turned away to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the size the boy would wear . " That 's the way things are in Germany now , " she said in a wild , wounded voice when she came back to the counter . " Will there be anything else ? " she said , and she took up her pencil and began writing the sales-check out . " Well , then , maybe you 'd ask him whereabouts he lives , " the soldier said . The boy was doing the buttons of the shirt up wrong , and the soldier sat down on the hinged seat beside him , and his long , dark supple fingers set the buttons right . Then he helped him pull the blue jeans on over the wet , shrunk , cotton pants , and he adjusted the straps of them over the boy 's shoulders , while the woman put the second question to the boy . " He says he does n't know where he lives , " she said in answer , saying these words in condemnation of him and of the people from which he came , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decency , the order , they had , as a country , known before . The soldier was fixing the jeweled neck-scarf on the boy 's shirt collar , adjusting the nickel slide loop of it , and for a moment he did not speak . " Well , maybe you 'd be so kind to ask him , ma'am , how he come here alone , " the soldier said then , and the saleswoman turned her head toward the boy , but not quite to him , giving only the side of her schoolmistress face to him , and she put the words in a tense , low , almost menacing German to him , and at once , when she was finished , the eager piping of the boy 's voice began . And then his answer was given , and the saleswoman did not speak . She had begun making figures on the sales-slip , but now her hand which held the pencil ceased to move , and she seemed to look at nothing , not at the sales-pad before her , or at the people moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy . " He says his mother brings him here in the morning , " she said at last , " and she leaves him outside when the people start coming . And then she comes back and picks him up in the evening again . " T HE soldier had arranged the neck-scarf on the boy 's shirt , and he had finished with the buttons , and he sat without moving on the hinged wooden seat , unable to think of anything to say . And then his eyes shifted to the saleswoman 's face , and before he spoke , he cleared his throat . " Maybe he 'd tell you if he was in here before  --  you know , if he ever come in with anybody who got things for him before he come in with me , " he said . The boy was dressed in the rodeo shirt , and the blue jeans , and good tie-shoes were on his feet , and , as he spun in wonder before the full-length panel of the mirror , he did not hear the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to say it twice before he halted in his spinning and then the answer came . " He says he 's been in the PX , and in the coffee shop , but nobody took him to the Clothing Store before , " the saleswoman translated in bitterness . " He says somebody brought his little sister in last week , but the shoes she got were n't as good as the shoes you bought him , and she only got one pair of socks . " Then she cried out in a low , fierce voice across the counter to the soldier : " Do n't you see how it is with the people of this country ? Do n't you see they do n't know the difference between good and evil any more ? You should take all these things away from him ! You should take the clothes off him and put him back out in the rain again ! Germans like that deserve nothing , nothing ! " But the boy of whom she spoke paid no heed either to the woman , with her aging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was spinning , with his arms outstretched , before the figure of the flushed , blond child who spun , in his bright new clothes , within the glass . " Well , at home , " said the soldier , and his voice was quiet as he counted the bills of military currency out ; " at home , ma'am , I never had much occasion to do for other people , so I was glad to have had this opportunity offered me , " he said , and then he went away .
