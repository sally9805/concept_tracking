txt Four of six officials elected last ' November in the Town of Putnam Valley , Putnam County , may be holding office as a result of votes illegally cast by New York City residents . An investigation into the voting in the upstate community , ordered , by Attorney General Jacob K. Javits , indicates that more than 350 votes were cast illegally by metropolitan area residents who have summer , homes in Putnam County . Whitman Knapp , who direct-1 ed the investigation as a special assistant attorney general , declared in a report to Mr. Javits that " it could be established that the Democratic candidates received the great preponderance of the illegal vote . " The Democrats won five of the six town offices at stake . Since only one of the candidates won by a plurality larger than 225 , Mr. Knapp pointed out , " the importance of this irregu- , Iarity becomes manifest . " The only Republican to win in the town election last Novena -- ber was Councilman Samuel Slutzsky , elected by four votes . ' The re-election of Supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaffected by the illegal votes inasmuch as he won in a three-way contest by a vote larger than the combined vote of his opponents . Javits Plans Petition Mr. Javits said his first step toward " re-establishing , respect and observance of the election Law " would be to petition in the Supreme Court to strike from the election rolls the names of persons shown to have voted illegally . After the court has ruled on this petition , Mr. Javits said he would be in a better position to decide whether to start a suit challenging the validity of the election . Mr. Knapp was optimistic that the election could be upset by a court challenge , but he recommended against such action . " An attack on the election would necessitate a full trial requiring ? each of the challenged voters personally to appear in court in Putnam County for examination and cross-examination , " said Mr. , Knapp . " As all of them work and reside in the metropolitan area , this would obviously cause great inconvenience if not hardship to persons who , we have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knapp 's report exonerated the illegal voters of any attempt to violate the law . He pointed out that the Republicans as well as the Democrats sought to attract summer residents for voting purposes , but that the Democrats apparently worked harder and were more successful . Attached to Mr. Knapp 's re- port was a photostat ? of a Putnam ' Valley Democratic paper containing a coupon ' for New ' York City residents wishing transportation to the town from the Bronx subway terminals . This was the second recent investigation of voting in ' Putnam County . J. Irwin Shapiro , State Commissioner of Investigation , made a county-wide investigation after ' the November election , reporting to Governor Harriman that county registration " exceeds by 57 per cent the total non-alien population of voting ' age . " Mr. Javits attributed the situation to the " exploitation " of the non-personal registration system . In communities of under 5,000 population and in unincorporated villages of any size , personal registration is not required . ' Names can be placed on the election rolls at the request of party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bi-partisan election commission . Mr. Javits pointed out that the exploitation attributed to the Democrats could not have occurred ' " if the Republican election commissioner and inspectors had been diligent in asserting the prerogatives of their office . " Mr. Javits saw in the findings a strong case for adoption of a state vide . system of permanent personal registration as contrasted to non-personal registration . Mr. Knapp arrived at his figure of more than 350 illegal voters out of a 2,300 total by a tabulation of those who frankly admitted their principal permanent residence was outside the town and those who had declared their intention by availing themselves of free tuition for their children at schools in the metropolitan area , available only to permanent residents . ? Assisting Mr. Knapp was Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Uris , head of the Election Frauds Bureau . Prior to the November election , Mr. Javits had removed from the Putnam ' Valley election rolls the names of 117 persons who had been found registered also in New York City .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
