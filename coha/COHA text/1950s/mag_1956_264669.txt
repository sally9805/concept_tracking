An American landed on Erin 's green <P> isle , <P> He gazed at Killarney with rapturous <P> smile . <P> " How can I buy it ? " he said to the <P> guide , <P> " I 'll tell you how , " with a smile he <P> replied , <P> How can you buy all the stars in the <P> skies ? <P> How can you buy two blue Irish eyes ? <P> How can you purchase a fond mother 's <P> sighs ? <P> How can you buy Killarney ? * <P> Last week , in answer to the old song , Florida Real Estate Broker James Stuart Robertson , 59 , showed how even a non-Irishman could own Killarney . His formula : after the owner dies and the tax collectors haunt his heirs , step in with enough green dollars and a promise never to spoil the scenery . <P> For 400 years before Robertson 's purchase , Killarney had been owned by the Earls of Kenmare , who had jealously guarded the natural beauty made famous by poet , musician and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl had died , his heir , Mrs. Beatrice Grosvenor , was forced to put 8,500 acres of the 9,000-acre estate up for sale so that she could pay off a 70,000 ( $196,000 ) inheritance tax . But she could find no buyer . Irishmen in Dublin , afraid that Killarney would fall into unsympathetic hands , started a fund-raising campaign , could raise only 10,000 . In the U.S. , sharing similar fear , the Bartenders Association of Boston voted $1,000 ( 357 ) for a " Save Killarney " fund-also not enough . <P> Seven weeks ago , in Boca Raton , Fla. , Robertson , who has made his money in shipping and real estate , read a news item saying that the Lakes of Killarney were for sale . He flew to Ireland , looked over the 30 page , 2 ft. - by- 3 ft. parchment deed written in Latin during the reign of Charles I ( 1625-49 ) . Then , after pledging that he would maintain the rustic tradition of Killarney and continue to permit the public to enjoy the property , Robertson paid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ancient Abbey of Saint Finian , Kenmare House , two lakes , 60 islands . <P> Disclaiming any plot to " Americanize " Killarney with motor boats or automobiles , Robertson , of Scottish-Irish descent , plans to summer in Killarney , winter in Florida . <P> <P> * Copyright 1948 by the Peter Maurice Music Corp .
