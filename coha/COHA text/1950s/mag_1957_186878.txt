THE NEW INFLATION . <P> To U.S. economists the biggest puzzle today is the " new inflation , " so called because it flies in the face of all their classical theories about the sources of inflation . Traditionally , inflation is caused by excessive demand for goods in short supply . But many consumer prices today are rising in the face of softened demand and below-capacity production in such key industries as steel , autos , appliances . To describe this new phenomenon , economists have coined a new phrase : " cost-push " inflation . Some go on to contend that price boosts , such as the recent steel price rise , are caused primarily by the push of labor 's wage demands . But is labor really to blame ? <P> Most economists are well aware that the problem of inflation is far too complex to be laid at the door of any one group . Dozens of factors contribute , such as high Government spending , support prices for farmers and other subsidized groups , and a faster turnover of loan funds to offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new study , the Bureau of Labor Statistics points out that prices have actually led wages upward during most of the postwar period . <P> The first burst of postwar inflation came when pent-up demand and wartime savings caused such a scramble to buy that shortages turned up everywhere , and most businessmen cashed in by raising prices . Then came the Korean war , and once more a scramble for materials and goods sent prices soaring . Wages were slow in catching up . In fact , after General Motors set up the first automatic " annual improvement factor " increase in wage contracts in 1950 , Charles E. Wilson , then G.M. president , said : " It is not primarily wages that push up prices . It is primarily prices that pull up wages . " After 1952 , wages began to catch up to prices , while the cost of living held steady . In the third round of inflation , which started in 1956 because of heavy business spending for expansion on top of heavy spending by Government and consumers , wages galloped up neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages was due not only to the scarcity of labor but also to the spread throughout industry of the G.M. idea of automatic increases . This ran counter to traditional business practice because it placed emphasis on a long-term rise in productivity and kept wages rising even when productivity temporarily stopped rising ( as it did last year ) or business temporarily slackened ( as in steel and autos this year ) . <P> For their part , many businessmen became wedded to the idea of a continually expanding economy . Under such circumstances-and with money tight-they decided on a long-term policy of financing more of this continuous expansion out of profits instead of through stock and bond issues . Disregarding temporary conditions of supply and demand , they began to set what Senator Kefauver and economists such as Edwin Nourse , ex-chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , call " administered prices " - prices that are set to achieve a predetermined profit level that will defray not only wage increases but also most of the expenses of new plant expansion .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
