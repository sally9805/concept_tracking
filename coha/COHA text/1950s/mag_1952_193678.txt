THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINS ( 375 pp. ) - Godfrey Blunden-Lippincott ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> During World War I , an Albanian was asked how he felt about the war . " What ? " he replied . " Two dogs are fighting for a bone , and you ask the bone how it feels ? " <P> In World War II , the Ukraine was such a bone . Ukrainian nationalism , long feared and thwarted by the czars , had been ruthlessly suppressed by the commissars . When the war came to Russia , some Ukrainians hoped the Nazis might be a lesser evil , but they soon learned that between two dictatorships there can be little choice . <P> In The Time of the Assassins , Novelist Godfrey Blunden tells how the people of Kharkov learned this lesson during the 16 months of the first Nazi occupation . The tone of the story is cool , almost detached , but its tragic quality comes through no less clearly for that . Author Blunden has obviously pondered his War and Peace ; like Tolstoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has tried to fit a human drama into the frame of contemporary history . <P> Satraps &; Hand-Raisers . The novel opens with the Nazi entry into Kharkov . Soon some German officers are gloating over rows of Russian secret-police files in which , as one SSman says with professional admiration , there is " for each and every individual a dossier . " With cold brutality , the Nazis proceed to murder the Kharkov Communists , not bothering to distinguish between active satraps of Stalin and mere party hand-raisers . But in the bowels of the city , the Russian secret police rebuilds its organization ; in the forests , guerrillas stir , and from the east comes the Russian counterattack . By the end of the story the Russians are back in Kharkov , exterminating their countrymen who wavered during the Nazi occupation . <P> Within this bitter outline of history , Novelist Blunden has created a large number of vivid people . The most important-and a genuine original-is Dr. Karandash , an old Ukrainian radical who had escaped from Russia years before . Picked up by the Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborate . His hope is an independent Ukraine . Too late , Karandash realizes that he has fooled himself . When he tries to reach the Communist underground , it betrays him to his Nazi bosses . <P> At the opposite pole of character stands Fomin , a teen-age Communist . Fearless and obedient , his mind rattling with party slogans , Fomin is both admirable and terrifying in his strength-the strength of a man to whom morality is meaningless . In the Stalinist future , Fomin is certain to be a big man . <P> The other characters are sketched in lightly but clearly : an ex-German Communist so embittered that his only need is to kill Russians ; a gentle Ukrainian professor dreaming of the purity of his suppressed native language while he entertains homeless orphans with fantasies of great feasts : an eleven-year-old Ukrainian girl who volunteers as a spy for the Nazis ; an SS general , coldly calculating even in defeat , who traps the collaborating schoolteachers of Kharkov , and delivers them to the mercies of the Russians .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
