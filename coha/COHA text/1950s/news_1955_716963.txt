txt Despite a tendency to look the other way whenever the question arises , Congress is heading inevitably toward another battle over increasing the statutory limit on the national debt . For the time being , the Administration officially is saying nothing that might stir up dislcussion of this issue . But nothing i has occurred , and nothing seems likely to occur before Congress adjourns , to change " the Treasury 's conviction that the limit must be raised . " It is quite obvious , " said one official who is in close touch with the situation , " that we wo n't be able to get by under the present permanent ceiling of $275,000 , - 000,000 . " " They 've got to make a showing that an increase is absolutely necessary , " Senator Harry F. Byrd , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , said . " I do n't intend to give 1 them $1 more than is necessary to get by . I am opposed to any permanent increase . " June 30 Limitation Even while his party was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeating the Administration 's plan to raise the debt limit two years ago and for holding last year 's increase to a temporary $6,000,000,000 . The temporary ceiling of $281 , - 000.000,000 automatically drops back to $275,000,000,000 next June 30 . At that time , according to the Administration 's latest available official estimate , the actual debt subject to the limit will be about $274,000,000,000 . During the . succeeding six months , however , expenditures , are expected to exceed revenues by about $8,000,000,000 . That would push the debt $7,000,000 , - ' 000 above the present permanint limit . Such was the picture outlined by President Eisenhower in his Budget Message last January . " Thus , " he concluded , " it will not be possible to pay the Government 's bills in that period without exceeding the $275,000 , - 000,000 limit ' , ' " Therefore , I have no alternative but to ask Congress to again increase the debt limit . " Rather than improving , the outlook has worsened since January . Signs are multiplying that actual spending in the 1956 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's January estimate of $62,408,000,000 . One factor is Congress ' apparent determination to go above Presidential recommendations on pay rises for Federal employes . Another is a substan // tial increase in estimated outlays for farm price supports . Congressional resistance to the proposed method of financing $20,000,000,000 of the President 's ! ten-year highway program may likewise have its effect . The President recommended raising the money by loans that would not be counted as part of the national debt . The idea seems likely to be rejected . Seasonal fluctuations in Federal revenues are largely responsible for the debt limit dilemma . Most tax collections take place between January and July . That is the explanation for President Eisenhower 's estimate that expenditures would exceed revenues by $8,000,000,000 in the lean July-December period while the deficit for the entire 1956 fiscal year ( July 1 , ** 30 , 1956 ) would amount to only $2,408,000,000 . He was allowing for a sizable excess of revenues over expenditures from January to June to offset most of the July-December deficit . Even so , he forecast that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year would be close to $276,000,000,000 . It now stands at $273,600,000,000 plus about $500,000,000 that is not Isubject to the statutory limit . On Dec. 2 , it was $278,400,000,000 , the highest point of the present fiscal year . In future years , seasonal fluctuations will be less pronounced as a consequence of a provision in the 1954 tax revision law requiring most big corporations to pay part of their current-year taxes in September and December . Next September and December , big corporations operating on a calendar-year basis will pay 10 per cent of their 1955 taxes , which would not have been due until 1956 under previous law . The percentage will be stepped up gradually over the next five years until the taxes are due in four equal quarterly installments . This is emphasized by Senator Byrd in opposing any permanent increase in the debt ceiling . If the budget is balanced , he contends , it may be possible in the long run to stay within the existing $275,000,000,000 permanent limit . The Administration has not yet disclosed whether it will ask for a temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wants . Two years ago President Eisenhower asked for a permanent increase of $15,000,000,000 , which was approved by the House of Representatives but pigeon-holed by the Senate Finance Committee . Last year his Secretary of the Treasury , George M. Humphrey , proposed a permanent incase of $5,000,000,000 plus a temporary rise of the same amount . At Senator Byrd 's insistence , itesetbled for the temporary $6,000 , - 000,000 increase .
