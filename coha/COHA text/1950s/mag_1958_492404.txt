Although I have been on my own since I left the White House in 19+5. it would cer  --  tainly be a mistake to think that I have been alone or felt alone . Fortunately , my work keeps me closely in touch with many people and many activities in this country and abroad , and I have an opportunity to talk with not only distinguished persons but with a large number of young people with fresh and inter  --  esting ideas . My mother-in-law once remarked that I liked to " keep a hotel , " and I probably do when 1 am at my cottage at Hyde Park . There usually seem to be plenty of guests there and they may include almost anyone from the Emperor of Ethiopia to my newest great-grandchild . In the summer , I do much of my shopping at the roadside stands , keep the freezer well stocked and always try to be pre  --  pared to feed any number up to twenty  --  most of them unexpected  --  for luncheon . One day last summer , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but about midmorning a man with whom I had some business called and said he would like to drop by . Then he added that he would like to bring his wife and daughter WO . A few minutes Wei- a neighbor called and said he would like to bring over a friend and his friend 's two children . There were other calls later , and by midday we had eighteen persons for luncheon . ? Nre eat outdoors a great deal , on the porch or picnic grounds , and any cook I have must be expert at whipping up a souffle or scrambled eggs or other dishes that can be prepared quickly and eaten quickly . So , as is usually the case , we got by . A number of my visitors are friends or acquaintances connected with my work for the American Association for the United Na  --  lions or with my earlier life in the White House , while others are official visitors to the grave of my husband . One of the most inter  --  esting was Emperor Haile Selassie , of Ethiopia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States . He was a slight , bearded man with dignity and strength of character and , I felt , a desire to foster free  --  dom , peace and progress in his country . It seemed to me that the Western clothes he wore on his journey were less impressive on him than the robes and sandals of his own land , but he was a person I liked and admired . The Department of State had , of course , made all arrangements for his visit . A rep  --  resentative of the department advised me that PILGRIMS VI ) ICS THE GREAT THE FAMOUS there would he nineteen persons in his entour  --  age . He would arrive at noon and I was to meet him at my husband 's grave in the rose garden . He was to visit the library where the records of my husband 's administration arc kept . He positively must get to the house by one o'clock because he wanted to see a tele  --  vision broadcast of a film that he had made . Then the State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a half hour alone in his room before luncheon for rest and contemplation . I thought this a rather crowded schedule , but I did n't try to argue with the State De  --  partment protocol officer . I met the emperor and accompanied him to the library . He was much interested in modernizing his own coun  --  try and when he saw the excellent system for keeping records in the library he became ex  --  cited and summarily ordered his entire staff to be assembled . " Look ! " he exclaimed , waving his hand to  --  ward the library stacks . " Study this system ! Here is how you do it ! Here is how you keep history ! " He was so busy examining the library that I barely managed to get him to the house on the stroke of one o'clock . He found a low stool in the living room and seated himself in front of the television set and seemed to forget every  --  thing else as the film of himself came on the screen . I am not sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . In any event , he was fascinated and the minutes passed with no sign that he was ready to retire to his room for the scheduled halt- hour before luncheon . This rest period had been so strongly emphasized to me , however , that at last I approached and spoke to him in French . " Your Majesty , " I said , " I believe you want to rest for half an hour alone . " He did not turn his gaze from the television screen , but his reply was prompt . " Oh , no . It is not necessary for me to be alone . I only wanted to take off my shoes for a little while . " Still watching the screen , he pointed down  --  ward . " And , " he added , " my shoes are off . " I looked down . The emperor 's shoes were certainly off and he was wiggling his toes comfortably . At luncheon , I scattered members of the Ethiopian party among my American guests at a number of tables . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates to their places or some of the children carried plates to them . Members of the emperor 's staff were all eager  --  doubtless due to his prodding  --  to learn all they could about American ways . But they were accustomed to many servants at home and I do n't believe they ever understood our explanations of why the woman whose hus  --  band had been the head of a great state no longer was attended by a large number of butlers , maids and footmen . After the emperor returned to his own coun  --  try , he thoughtfully sent me some Ethiopian whole coffee beans . In fact , he sent me - 100 pounds of them and I had quite a time using them up . Another distinguished visitor to Hyde Park was Prime Minister Nehru , of India , who came to luncheon one day when a number of mygrandchildren and their friends were there . A striking figure in his hing , dark coat and white trousers bound tightly at the ankles , die prime minister seemed delighted to see the young people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor to talk to them for a long time Ho appeared to be just as interested in asking them questions as they were in hearing his views , and it was an after  --  noon I shall lung remember . Mr. Nehru was troubled during his visit to this country by the fact that he was unable to address large groups of Americans . In India . he was accustomed to speaking to many do lit-sands of persons at great outdoor meetings , andapparently he had assumed he would have the same opportunity in the United States . Our Government . however , was responsible for his safety while he was here and our security of  --  ficers limited his largest audience to about axon persons  --  and they were at a dinner at The Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City . He was greatly disappointed , but otherwise considered his visit a success . As I got to know the prime minister better when I later visited India , I felt he was a man with great physical and mural courage . Hut discovered that his remarkable intellectual abilities did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Oontinued on Page 11.10i ) 0n My Own ( Continued from dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir , Mr. Nehru was com  --  pletely emotional because of his personal tics to Kashmir . I felt he suffered a stop  --  page of all reason on that particular sub  --  ject and contradicted the high ideals that he normally expressed in regard to the right of people to decide their own des  --  tiny . To an extent l had never before wit  --  nessed . Mr. Nehru has the power to concentrate . Once at a dinner . I noticed that he seemed to base completely de  --  tached himself from his surroundings , Ile ate , but he obviously was " not pres  --  ent . " He was far away and thinking about something entirely unrelated to the din  --  neraahle conversation . On another occa  --  sion , I observed that he was really not listening to what I was saying to him iind , for the moment , was even unaware that I was trying to carry on a conversation . This power of self-detachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was something I had previously oh  --  ser  --  cd only in persons who had been a long time in solitary confinement . Mr. Nehru has the viewpoint of a man edu cated in the West , but at heart he is very much an Indian as well as very much a human being . I t seems to me that Secretary of State John Foster Dulles ' method of dealing with Prime Minister Nehru has been un  --  fortunate and unwise . You have to re  --  member that India is newly independent and the Indians are highly sensitive in re  --  gard to their independence . You have to remember , too , that since the Commu  --  nists came into power in China , India is the only large non-Communist nation in Asia . Mr. Nehru firmly expects India will remain non-Communist , and this is of great importance to the West . Yet Secre  --  tary Dulles has , in my opinion , made sev  --  eral grave errors in dealing with India . When negotiating the Japanese treaties , for example . he visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go personally to India . Mr. Nehru felt this was an obvi  --  ous slight , and I can not sec how it was wise to create resentment toward us in such an important country . Then when India and Pakistan were in conflict , we sent arms to Pakistan , theoretically at least for defense on her northern borders . It created more bitterness against us in India , and it might well have been avoided by limiting our aid to Pakistan to the economic field . I can not help but feel that Mr. Dulles fails to understand the feelings of many of the peoples with whom we must deal  --  that he lacks an  --  tennae with which to reach out and sense the altitudes of others at times when such attitudes may be of utmost importance in our struggle against Communism . To a lesser extent , this same lack of understanding marked the official tour which the State Department planned for King Paul and Queen Frederika of Greece . when they visited the United States in 1953 . I had met the king and queen earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , I had been invited to lunch with them at the palace near Athens . Our embassy made all arrange  --  ments for ms visit and , as usual , they sent me to the palace in a very dignified-looking but slow-moving automobile . We were rolling sedately along the road when there was a great roar of motors be  --  hind us and a racy sports car zipped up the highway and passed us at very high speed . It was followed by several other cars that were straining to keep up . I got a good look at the driver of the first ear and realized that it was the king , dashing along as if he were a racing driver out for Page 33 ) a morning 's test spin . He went so fast , in fact , that before we got to the palace At had passed two of the automobiles which had been accompanying him , but which had found the pace so swift that they had broken down . I found the queen charming , warm and intelligent . Perhaps the king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an al* man and greatly interested in the young people of his country , so many of whom are orphans from war and natural dn . asters , and so many of whom are hungry . I believe I receive more letters from Greece asking for help than I do from any other country and I know they need so much . At luncheon , the queen told inc of her efforts to alleviate this situation and added that someday she hoped to visit the United States and see our re . habilitation hospitals , where great prop ress has been made in helping handi  --  capped children . When she and the king did make the trip , they were escorted many places la , representatives of the Department of February to , tags State . I noticed , however , that they re  --  served five days at the end of their official visit for an unofficial tour on their own in New York City . So 1 wrote her a note when they arrived in New York . recalling our conversation in Greece and inquiring whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . Goodness knows what the State De  --  partment had shown them at great ex  --  pense and effort , but she replied that she had not seen anything that she really wanted to see . then said that 1 would arrange a short tour for her , and one morning Mrs , Joseph P. Lash and 1 guided her to several institutions . We went to the new hospital where Dr. Howard Rusk has done so much to help the recovery of crippled children . The queen was won  --  derful with the patients . One little boy who had had polio attempted to show her how he had learned to walk again , but he was in such a hurry that he fell . It was the queen who got to him before any  --  one else and picked him up , saying , " Do n't worry . Many of us fail when we try to show what we can do . But I 'll help you up and you show me again . " We also visited the Alfred E. Smith housing project , which includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart  --  ment of a second-generation Greek cou  --  ple . The queen seemed impressed and , upon leaving , remarked , " I would n't mind living here myself . " Later , visiting the Henry Street Settlement House , we were walking  --  a sedate little procession of officials accompanied the queen  --  from one building to another when we passed a city fire house . Looking through the big open door , the queen saw the brass fire pole and paused , " Do you think they would mind if went in ? " she asked . said I was sure they would be happy to have her and I introduced a fireman on duty to her . She seemed so interested that I then asked the fireman if it would be possible to demonstrate how the men answered an alarm . He rang the bell and , an instant later , the men began sliding down the brass pole from the second floor to jump on their trucks . Then , last of all , their big cat came sliding down the pole . The queen laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-by , we rejoined our dignified little proces  --  sion and walked sedately on down the street . One of the royal families of Europe I enjoyed visiting was that of Holland . I had always admired the former queen . Wilhelmina , for her stanch courage dur  --  ing the war and her insistence upon being a good Dutch housewife as well as a capable ruler . Even when she was the sovereign , she often went by herself to a small cottage that she owned and , for a week or so at a time , did her own house  --  keeping , cooked her own meals and , I suppose , even made her own bed . I must confess that I have never understood the Dutch manner of making up a bed . When I stayed at the Dutch summer palace I was given a historic suite , built several centuries ago and usually reserved for dis  --  tinguished guests . The rooms were de  --  lightful and I enjoyed staying there  --  ex  --  cept when I tried to sleep . There were wonderful linens on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Dutch go out of their way to make themselves un  --  comfortable at night . There usually is a long bolster placed at the head of the bed and it is tucked in so firmly when the bed is made that I can never find a way to re  --  move it . Then , in addition to the bolster , there are big pillows . This makes such a mass of things at the head of the bed that you do not have room to lie down andstretch out unless you are a short person , which t um not . Struggling with this problem on one occasion , I tried sitting up to sleep , but that is not satisfactory for mc . About all I could do was to curl up as comfortably as possible with my feet against the foot  --  board . Perhaps I just do n't understand the sleeping habits of the Dutch . 1 have a very special feeling about Wil  --  helmina 's daughter , Queen Juliana , be  --  cause , like Princess Martha of Norway , she came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her husband and children . Franklin was godfather to their third daughter . She and her husband have brought up their children in a demo  --  cratic way and part of the time they have attended the public schools . Once when two of the children and some small friends were walking home , they passed an orchard where they picked up some apples which had fallen outside the fence , but which , of course . did not belong to them . The owner called the police and a little later the police telephoned the pal  --  ace and informed the then Princess Juli  --  ana that her children were more or less in custody . " Very well , " she replied , " you must deal with them just as with the others . Then telephone me again and we will come and get them . " All the children were reprimanded by the police and at least a couple of them received additional punishment at the hands of their parents when they got back to the royal palace . I was the guest of Juliana before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Utrecht awarded me a degree of doctor of laws . It was a colorful ceremony and at the end of it the princess and I drove in a carriage drawn by four horses with great pomp and ceremony to the women 's 1 ' 07 house of the university . The women were very proud because it was not often that a woman was given a degree , but on this occasion they not only participated in the ceremony but we had women as outrid  --  ers accompanying our carriage . The prin  --  cess was at the students ' house with me. and I look back upon this particular inci  --  dent with a great deal of pleasure . As queen . Juliana has worked vigor  --  ously to help develop a spiritual under  --  standing among Europeans . She has sought with other European powers to awaken the people of Europe to their re  --  sponsibilities . Her government has been influential in the Council of Europe and she has led in the humanitarian efforts of her country to help refugees . The pages of history will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings . Another remarkable woman for whom I had admiration and affection is Mad  --  ame Chiang Kai-shek . She had stayed with us at the White House and she came to Hyde Park after Franklin 's death . She once told me that she and her husband felt it was their duty to establish demo  --  cratic government in China and that they should carry on to the bitter end from Formosa or anywhere else in the struggle toward that goal . She always seemed to me to be a woman of great ability , but I never ceased to be perplexed by her ideas about the establishment of democracy . I think that intellectually she understands what democracy means . but despite the fact that she went to college in this coun  --  try she does not know how to live democ  --  racy . I remember when President Truman sent Gen. George C. Marshall to China during the critical days of the civil war , to attempt to persuade Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to inaugurate govern  --  mental reforms in an effort to unite all factions . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree to various chain , .. that could fur  --  ther a denioeratic form of gosernment , but the neat Jay Chiang Kai-shek would talk to some standpaiter war lord who would persuade hint to forget the whole thing . As a result . the idea of democracy was projected , but nes er put into practice . Mans things have been written about Madame Chiang 's wartime %1st 's to the White House which were not completely accurate . She was ill much of the time and had to have trained nurses and special care . She had with her as secretaries her niece and nephew . who were not always as understanding and careful as they should have been about the comfort and convenience of other people . On the whole , I found Madame Chiang a warm and able woman , but w hen she was deal  --  ing with matters of state she could be completely cold and completely deter  --  mined to achieve w hat she felt was neces  --  sary for her gosernment 's good . Some of my pleasant memories are of visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' l and Queen Elizabeth came to the White House be  --  fore the war and later seated us at Hyde Park . 1 shall never forget the day they left Hyde Park . It was in June , 1939 , when the threat of tragic esents in Europe al  --  ready weighed heasily in all our minds . Franklin and 1 went uith them to the Hyde Park railroad station , where their train was waiting . Nobody had arranged anything special , but , of course , the pub  --  lic knew the time of their departure and crowds had gathered . The steep little knolls rising on each side of the railroad tracks were simply coscred with people , who waited , rather silently , until our good-hys were said . But then , as the train pulled out . somebody began sing  --  ing Auld Lang Sync and then eserybody was singing , and it seemed to me that there was something of our friendship and our sadness and something of the uncer  --  tainty of our futures in that song that could not has e been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king and queen , standing on the rear platform of the train , were deeply moved . I know I was . Of course , 1 saw the king and queen in London during the war when they re  --  fused to lease Buckingham Palace to es  --  cape the mass bombardment of their capital , but it was not until after the war , in 1946. that I first visited Windsor Castle . In one way 1 rather dread the for  --  mality of any palace %ad , but on this oc  --  casion some of my friends were there and everything we did was so interesting that 1 did not have time to think of my shy  --  ness or lack of preparation for the visit . One of the things I worried about , of course , was what kind of clothes I would need . Queen Elizabeth always had such a wonderful wardrobe and always looked as if she had just a moment before been in the hands of a skillful maid and hair  --  dresser , as . indeed , she usually had been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by three maids and there were hardly enough closets to ac  --  commodate all her dresses properly . I myself could not travel in such style , and I did not have much experience to draw on as to what 1 would need as a guest . I remembered that during the war clothes had been a sery unimportant question when I sisiteal England . I was flying then and I was permitted to take very little luggage . Furthermore , there was no elab  --  orate entertaining during the war and I did not need many changes . Even so , I was a bit taken aback when I arrived at Buck  --  ingham Palace and was shown my dress  --  ing room with huge closets all around the walls . The maid who unpacked my lug  --  gage was well trained . but I could sec that she was surprised when all she could lind to hang up in the enormous expanse of closets was one evening dress , one after  --  noon dress , a few blouses and an extra skirt . Remembering that earlier occasion , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in I946 ? my wardrobe might be rather skimpy for peacetime . One thing helped me greatly , however . I was in mourning and a black dress is II black dress . No one sees much difference in what you wear in such circumstances . So I took only one dressy evening dress in black , one less dressy evening dress in black , one after  --  noon dress , a kind of rough country suit and coat , and a simple black dress and long coat . I had two black hats , one de  --  signed to withstand the ever-rainy English weather and one a little more dressy for special occasions . As I look hack . I am quite sure that I was right and clothes made no difference , for all black dresses look alike . I did not succeed . however , in looking as beautifully perfect on all oc  --  casions as the queen did in the United States . The king and queen were kindness it  --  self . They showed me to my bedroom and sitting room and told me that Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Windsor Castle to greet me . Dur  --  ing my visit , breakfast was brought to our rooms , but luncheon and dinner were served in the big dining room , and at dinner the Highland piper , dressed in kilts and bonnet , came in to march once around the table , playing his bagpipe . There was , of course , much formality , but 1 was impressed by the easy manner of the king , dressed until dinnertime in tweed jacket and slacks , like a country squire relaying on the weekend , and by the skill of the queen in keeping their family life on a warm , friendly level even in such a historic setting as Windsor Castle . There were , in fact , many occa  --  sions when I felt that I might have been in almost any well-to-do British or American home . Princess Margaret , for example , had some young friends in and they promptly turned on the phonograph to listen to popular records . And I was amused to notice that like most fathers , the first thing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Meg , the music is too loud . Will you please turn it down ? " On our first evening at the palace we were taken on a tour of the galleries after dinner . I observed that , like my mother-in-law at her Hyde Park home , Quccn Mary knew where every painting and objer l'gors was placed  --  or at least where she thought each one should be placed . As a matter of fact , not everything was in the same place that it had been when she was the mistress of Windsor Castle . She promptly observed with no particular pleasure that the king had changed the banging of several paintings . Then she must have noticed that some art object was missing , because she asked her son what had happened to it . Perhaps with some hesitation , he replied that the ob  --  ject in question was behind a curtain . It made mc realize that the king , like any other son , must watch whatever he does in the light of his mother 's interest . During our tour , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cor  --  ner . The king called Princess Margaret to join us and got a stool . which he placed for her to stand on under the portrait . It was a painting of one of the princess ' dis  --  tant ancestors  --  I simply can not recall ho  --  and there was a quite remarkable resemblance between the picture and the handsome young girl standing on a stool beneath it . The king seemed pleased to demonstrate the resemblance and doubt  --  less Princess Margaret was accustomed to being asked to climb up on the stool . The next day we went through the brass at Windsor . To mc it is one of the most interesting I had ever seen , because of its historic documents , and I was pleased to be shown one of the newer manuscripts , which will one day he a his  --  toric document too . Princess Margaret took it out of a case to show it to us . It was an account of the coronation of her father and mother written by Princess Elizabeth , who was a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , and later , when Elizabeth herself wascrowned . I thought how often her account of that other coronation must have come to her mind . I was particularly struck by the then Princess Elizabeth , just twenty at the time of my visit , but very serious-minded . She came to me after a dinner given by the Pilgrim Society and said , " I understand you have been to see some of the homes where we arc trying to rehabilitate young women offenders against the law . I have not yet been to see them , but could you give me your opinion ? " I told her I was very favorably im  --  pressed by the experiment in which the government had taken over some of t country 's historic houses that the own could no longer afford to maintain . houses had been put under the care young women prisoners , who , with cite pert guidance and advice . had done th work of rehabilitating the houses an gardens to preserve them as nation monuments . Thus it was hoped not on ) to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist the young women to rebuild their own lives in a useful way . What struck me at the time was tha this young princess was so interested social problems and how they were ban handled . My old friend , Lady Stella Reading , has an extraordinary organiza  --  tion of women doing voluntary work in England , and she had , I am sure , an in  --  fluence on the young princesses in help  --  ing them to understand the social needs of the country . One evening at Windsor was particu  --  larly interesting to me because Prime Minister Winston Churchill was theft and after dinner we played The Game  --  a form of charades which is also popular in America . Queen Elizabeth acted as a kind of master of ceremonies and picked t out the words which the rest of us were called upon to act out in such a way that they could be guessed . She puzzled for some time over various words and ucca sionally turned to Mr. Churchill for as- sistance , but without success . The prime minister , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a cigar in his hand , sat glumly aside and would have nothing to do with The Game , which he obviously regarded as inane and a waste of the time of adults . Not even the queen 's pleas for advice could move him to take a small part in the activities . He just kept on being glum . Mr. Churchill  --  now Sir Winston  --  a , of course , one of the very unusual figures of our time . He was frequently at the White House during the tense years of the war and he and Franklin had many interests in common  --  not counting win  --  ning the war  --  so that they enjoyed each other 's company . They could talk for hours after dinner on any number of sub  --  jects . My husband , however , was so bur  --  dened with work that it was a terrible strain on him to sit up late at night with Mr. Churchill and then have to be at his desk early the next day , while his guest stayed in his room until eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this at the time . and the prime minister prob . ably remembered it when he said to me , " You do n't really approve of me , do you .

" Looking back on it , I do n't suppose I really did . 1 said good-by to everyone at Windsor Castle on Sunday evening , as 1 was leas  --  ing early Monday morning and did not expect to see them again before my de  --  departure . But Queen Mary did not say good-by . Instead , she raised her eyebrowli in a question . " Arc not my son and daughter-in-law seeing you in the morning ? " she asked in a surprised voice . " I shall see you , in any case ! " I protested , but , to my horror , the next morning she was up and dressed to per  --  fection , her white hair perfectly waved a kind of pompadour , and waiting in the big corridor to say good-by to me . And she had made her son , the poor king , get up @ @ @ @ @ @
