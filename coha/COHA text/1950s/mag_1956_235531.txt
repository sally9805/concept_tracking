Women by the hundreds steamed into Rabat to pay their respects to Morocco 's newly re-enthroned Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef . Some were old , some young ; some fat , some thin , some rich and some poor , but all had one thing in common : their faces were unveiled . <P> A generation ago , such exposure would have been tantamount to public nudity . The wearing of the veil-derived not from Koranic law but , like most feminine fashion , from an instinct for artful concealment-has largely disappeared from many modernized corners of Islam , but in Morocco it has hung on to become a symbol of woman 's enslavement . Inside the palace , however , sits Morocco 's foremost champion of unveiling : the Sultan 's own daughter , Princess Lalla ( Lady ) Aisha . <P> Slim , svelte and curvesome at 25 , she has never worn a veil in her life . Reared in the European manner by a series of <P> French governesses , she brushes her full lips with pink , wears blue jeans , listens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . It is not the fact that Moroccan women wear veils that bothers Princess Aisha : " The main thing is that they have the right to take them off if they want to . " <P> The Missionary . Actually , the Sultan has only himself to thank for Aisha 's militant feminist career . When Aisha was 16 years old , veilless and innocent of all social problems , she was put on a platform to deliver a speech written by her father demanding more rights for women . " I did n't know what it was all about , " she recalls , " but after I delivered the speech , I began to understand what had to be done . " <P> In time , Aisha 's agitating and her father 's condonement of it provided fine ammunition for the Sultan 's enemies . Conniving old El Glaoui , scheming with the <P> French to oust the Sultan , made a practice of indignantly exhibiting like a filthy postcard a picture of the Sultan 's daughter clad in a bathing suit . Aisha herself made so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered her to stop . When at last in 1953 El Glaoui had his way and the French packed Ben Youssef into exile with two wives and a few favorite concubines , the aroused women of Morocco were the first to unite in demand for his return . Many were killed in street fighting . Others did their strike duty at home , refusing to have children during the Sultan 's absence . <P> The Weak . When Ben Youssef was reestablished last November on his throne as Mohammed V , the women of Morocco were sufficiently organized to demand their rewards : the right to vote , the right to join unions , the right to better schooling for their children . Some even went so far as to demand a fairer deal in marital matters . As one explained , " Although we can not be against polygamy , for Allah decreed it , at least the Koran decrees that a man can take four wives only if he treats them equally . " But the Sultan 's daughter , who lives in a palace which not only contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concubines , is willing to admit that full emancipation will not be achieved overnight . " The older generation , " she says , " is not going to do anything . It 's the children who must revolutionize Morocco . "
