THIS is an occasion for thanksgiving and joy that we are all able to come together , after so many stormy years , to celebrate the New Republic . But why , let me ask , the new Republic ? either then or now ? .. . If we seriously demand a new America , do we disavow the one that is ? If we set ourselves to rise to new heights of greatness , without precedent in the whole story of man , do we thereby set human presuMption against the laws of Nature and of Natures God ? There is , I say , a peculiarly American answer to such questions . It is most quickly seen in a single fact : we are all immigrants . We have all come to a new land ? to , in fact , The New World . Other vast migrations there have been but never one like ' this We came to a new land but a land not made . We had to make it . We had to declare for what purposes it should be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation , a society ? a good society . We speak of the American Way of Life ? and whatever others may think about that expression , to the ordina , ry American it is self-evident truth and self-evident good . Preserve , conserve ? it would be only human if these should be henceforth the operative verbs of the American peoPie , It would be only human ? but it can not be And that the American knows . More than any other kind ' of man , the American knows.the truth that you , never stay where you are . . . . Our European and Asian friends often recommend to us , from their old world wisdom , that we should do just that , settle down , go slow , be " mature , " take it easy . It is good ad vice and we can use it ? in off-hours . But not in our business . The business of Henry America is to progress ; and Progress is the business of America . We are a nation forever on the march . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of the Advance Guard is especially important . Its job is to explore the future , to bring back reports of perils ahead and of opportunities . A very dif , ficult job ? never more difficult than now Partly because there is in the future the ominous threat of atomic war . What shall the Advance scout say about that ? Shall he crY Peace where there is no Peace ? Shall he bring back Olive branches of appeasement ? and find them poisoned ? Shall he recommend war ? Or shall he simply say stop , the future is hopelessly roadblocked . That is what he isoften tempted to do ? to say stop and philosophize that if we stay still for 20 or 30 years the problems will fade away . They wo n't . The Advance Guard must find and recommend a forward way through the roadblocks . But let us suppose there were no threats of catastro phic war . The problem of Progress in America would still be extraordinarily difficult for an utterly novel reason . In a brief overstatement , the reason is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been the traditionally proper subjects for political agitation and debate . Norman Thomas is fond of saying that ' practically everything he stood for when he entered politics has been accomplished . To cite only one example , he says : " I would not have dreamed of trying to get the kind of federal housing subsidy Senator Taft proposed 20 years later . " This is the astonishing state of affairs which I would like to call to your attention tonight . Underlying it is of course , a radical revolution in a basic equation of human life on earth . From the time that Abraham came out of Ur of the Chaldees until yesterday , a basic equation of human life was that a man ? and Eis wife and children ? by the sweat of their brows from sun up to sun down could just barely make enough to eat ; a tiny surplus went to the more or less necessary overlords . Today in America , in seven or eight hiptirs a day for five days a week and resting on two Sabbaths , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Do any of us really see what has happened and is happening ? If we have not even caught up with the present , how much less are we capable of heralding the future . One thing clearly foreseeable in the future of the Republic and of the human race is-an immense increase in the world 's wealth and standard of living . Even to call it an Age of Plenty may soon seem old-fashioned . Could there be any such thing as the Age of Too Much ? In any case , President Eisenhower , ex-President Truman , and the Joint Congressional Committee on the Economic Report are all ' on record with the forecast that the US national output will exceed 500 billion by 1964 .. As for the rest of the world , most of it is a wretchedly poor place ; yet it surely can not escape the prospering NEW REPUBLIC impact of an American Age of Plenty . Indeed , our own prosperity will more and more depend on its being shared with the world . If America and the world go on prospering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trillion dollar mark by the time ours passes the $500 billion mark , that is , within 10 years . This trillion dollar mark has taken civilized man something like 5,000 years to achieve . It is of more than symbolic interest . For the point is that having passed that mark , mankind will achieve his second trillion in less than 50 years . Such are the trends and the amazing probabilities . The abundance of all material things , from food , shelter and clothing to every luxury that automation can produce is already a taste on the tip of the American tongue . With the rest of the world it is now only a demand , the slogan of that revolution of expectations which has swept even the few remaining jungles of our earth . But they are right to demand it , for this is one human expectation which can and probably will be fulfilled . I WONDER if I am beginning to make clear the problem which I am posing for the Advance Guard . Merely to advocate increase and more increase in the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special function . Any of us ordinary editors can do that . Of course I do not say that all this material utopia will come about automatically . I do not mean that political battles , and very real ones , will not be necessary . Some of the same old problems are still with us , along with many new ones ? slums , Negro rights , not to mention traffic jams and mental health . But these problems are in process of , solution . And many of them are largely technical . The political battles that will obsolete these problems are battles for the ordinary tiobps , not uniquely for the Advance Guard . The business of the Advance Guard is to be in advance ? way up there ahead . And where is that ? Where , in the march of American civilization , is up front today ? That is what we shall look for in the New Republic . We need answers with far more vividness of foresight and depth of insight than are currently available or that I can ever begin to suggest tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously true , namely that ? our material and political problems having been so largely solved , our struggles ? and triumphs , if any ? will be in the realm of the spirit . Perhaps that has always been the case . Certainly the Passion for social justice 40 years ago did not arise from e dialectically material animals but on the contrary from men like Herbert Croly who were moved by moral imperatives and the divine discontent of the spirit . But now we are more directly confronted with questions of the spirit . And in fact the liberal today seems more concerned with attitudes and states of mind than , for example , with offensive poverty . A characteristic pronouncement of the last decade has been that we have not made spiritual advance comparable to our material and scientific advance . This pronouncement is made by nearly everyone ? by intellectuals , by scientists , by industrialists , even by political leaders . The commonest refrain on the innumerable luncheon platforms of America is , I should suppose , quote " what we need is spiritual and moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clich ? of the hour . Some-what similarly , 40 years ago , there was a widespread uneasiness about the injustice and ugliness in our in. dustrial society . Then the Advance Guard took hold ? analyzed , exposed , expounded and , above all , kindled the flame of enthusiasm to fight what had to be fought , and to build what had to be built . So , now , the Advance Guard has the opportunity to perform a similar task with regard to spiritual and moral values in American civilization . At first glance , there will be many objections to such an assignment . Some will raise the question of jurisdictional disputes , saying that spiritual and moral values are the business of the ecclesiastical unions . The pastors are indeed busy ? overworked and mostly underpaid . The churches are full and fuller . The best sellers are Bishop Sheen and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale ? not to mention less responsible providers of spiritual food . Well , if the layman gets into the spiritual battle , there may indeed be jurisdictional disputes : ? let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom of Heaven may open its doors more readily to the poor and simple than ? to the wise and literate ? nevertheless , most churchmen would , I think , agree that a serious problem today in America is religious illiteracy . We have a bull market in religion or spiritual values ? and buyers as uneducated as the buyers of stocks in 1929 . The analogy is suggestive . Must we have a catastrophic spiritual depression , on top of a false boom , before we can build a spiritually better commonwealth ? ' There would seem to be a call , here , for the service of the discerning intellectual . If , for example , there is a con flict between the claims of secular humanism and orthodox religion , what is the proper statement of that conflict and how can it be resolved honestly in an American . consensus ? Such a consensus was essential to the found- ing of our Republic : It will be equally essential to the survival of the Republic and to the politics of human liberty on a world scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . But it can never be taken for granted . The American consensus is forever needing to be pushed forward , criticized , elaborated in an expanding universe and now , in a contracting world . This may in ' deed be the high adventure of the immediate future --  one in which deeply personal needs are merged with the needs of society into a passion for truth and for righteousness . ? In the somewhat different vocabulary of secular humanism ) the needs I speak of are commonly summed ur under the word " culture . " That , too , is a good word ' DECEMBER 6 , 1954 ? and the active agenda for the improvement of American culture is a very long one , from TV to geriatrics . From this long list , let me select one subject , Education , to illustrate the need for sharper analysis , the kind of analysis which an Advance Guard is best fitted to supply . There is needed in this country tens of thousands of schoolrooms and hundreds of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we also need to be told about the quality of education ? what education for whom , why . . . . Throughout the panorama of American life , we need not just higher standards of living , but higher standards . It is your task . I suggest , to kindle in the minds and hearts of the people and their leaders , as it is the teachers ' task to kindle in our youth , a passion for higher standards ? standards of excellence ? in every field of life and thought and work . Not least do we need a higher standard of politics and political debate . We need more style in our politics ? more style to match more substance . I do not mean merely a highbrow style ... But our political style must be equal to our age , as it was in Jefferson 's time , and Lincoln 's . . . T His brings me to the great reality of our time : the question of War and Peace . Its dimensions are co- .. lossal , like the age we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in a parlor game , with words like co-existence , appeasement , preventive war . These are not the words of high . politics . The great words of high politics are Liberty , Justice and Law ? Freedom under Law . These words will never be repealed as the basic stuff to human destiny . They must therefore be made to mean something in our age . If these words perish , even for a space , America will perish with them . The other day in a moving speech , the Chief Justice of the United States referred to mankind 's hope for peace and added that of course Peace can only be attained through the rule of Law . He quoted a letter of some British soldiers to American G.I.s soon after Pearl Harbor . The British lads said that now they would all have to fight together so that instead of the world being ruled by the law of force it would be ' ruled by the force of law . But how much have intellectuals concerned themselves with this matter of Law in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Law as governing the relations of nations and all people within all , nations ? Fortunately there is no shortage of Advance Guard watchdogs against day-to-day infractions , both real and imaginary , of our own Bill of Rights at home ; but who among them is also trying to define for ' ur age , as the late Morris R. Cohen did for his , the universal relationship between human law and ideal justice ? It is a deep and prickly subject . Easier to ignore It . But like the Hound of Heaven , this question will Pursue you ? for the fact is : there'can be no peace wit law . Nor freedom either . 21 Personally , I wish that right now the United States would be putting herself in the forefront of the great worldwide concern for Law and the rule of Law . But she can not be expected to do this unless from the Advance Guard we get vivid suggestions as to how this ideal can be progressively incarnated . Meanwhile , mankind lives on the brink of anarchy . The United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote the rule of Law , unless the intellectuals have schooled themselves ? and us ? to know and to speak of the great concepts of Law as the necessary counterpart of Liberty and the actual basis of peace between men and nations . Speaking of spiritual and moral values ? and of intellectual values ? surely nothing could more clearly signify an advance in these values than a more lively comprehension of the creative uses of the Law . And here , if anywhere , is the concrete meaning of that deeply felt intuition that a triumph over this worldwide crisis will prove to be a triumph of the spirit . Let us speak no more then , of hopeless roadblocks lying across the path of the future . Peace is our objective : the advancement of the rule of law is the means . We have little time to waste . . . . Let us never forget that we Americans are an immigrant people destined throughout our living history , to a Pilgrim 's Progress ? with all the pains and joys of such a destiny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of the Old Testament . They too had a Promised Land . When in their march from Egypt they came to the edge of it , Moses sent 12 scouts across the river to spy out that land . They went , they saw and they returned to report . Ten of them reported that the Promised Land was inhabited by giants who would tear the Israelities to pieces and eat them up ? and the land was n't any good anyhow . The other two , Joshua and Caleb , reported otherwise . They said that the Promised Land was indeed a rich land , ? a land of milk and honey . As for the giants they were indeed formidable but could be overcome by faith and courage . The Israelities believed the 10 bad scouts and set up wails of despair . They rejected Joshua . Wherefore God condemned them and Moses too ? to 40 years in the wilderness . Only then did Joshua 's turn come , at last ? now not as scout but as commander . And he said to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and take the land ! And they did , and the walls of Jericho fell , and they . entered into the whole of the Promised Land . We too can condemn ourselves to 40 years in , the wilderness . Or we can listen to the young Joshua . I hope that the spirit of the young Joshua will prevail in our land , that all of us may be given the grace and the courage to believe the true report and that we may make our way with confidence into the New World now visible .
