New York Daily News Columnist John O'Donnell , who likes to remind readers that he was called a liar by Franklin D. Roosevelt , last week announced that he had made President Truman 's list too . O'Donnell found out about his nomination from South Carolina 's Governor <P> James F. Byrnes , who put the blast on Harry Truman in an article in Collier 's last week . Byrnes had wanted to include a letter from the President attacking columnists , reported O'Donnell , but Collier 's was afraid the columnists might sue for libel . So O'Donnell obligingly printed the letter himself . <P> Wrote President Truman : " I never read or listen to Walter Winchell , Westbrook Pegler , George Sokolsky or John O'Donnell , or any of the liars for the simple reason that it just stirs you up for no good purpose . " Added O'Donnell , with his usual choleric pride ; " After all , when you have won against such professional , high-grade , adroit and skillful liars as the late Franklin D. Roosevelt , for example , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . "
