" To perform its duties with entire independence , " said the London Times in 1852 , " the press can enter into no close or binding alliances with the statesmen of the day . The duty of the journalist is the same as that of the historian-to seek out the truth , above all things , and to present to his readers not such things as statecraft would wish them to know but the truth as near as he can attain it . " While U.S. and British newspapers today have more readers than ever in history , many observers on both sides of the Atlantic share a mounting conviction that the press is more than ever entangled with political alliances , less than ever concerned with the pursuit of attainable truth . <P> This week , in a new history of the British press called Dangerous Estate , newsmen may find a timely re-evaluation of their basic role on both sides of the Atlantic . Written by Francis Williams , a veteran Fleet Streeter who was editor of the Laborite Daily Herald before the war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailed by the London Observer 's reviewer as the best study of the press he had read , praised by the London Times and recommended by the Manchester Guardian as " required reading . " <P> Barnum 's Blood Brother . Williams believes that society in any stage of evolution gets the newspapers it deserves . " The press , " he says , " is the mirror of its age because the degree of authority and independence it is permitted to exercise , or is able to seize for itself , and the nature of its influence on public opinion , throw light on the real balance of power in a society . " Newspapers can no longer influence readers as they did when government was less complex and the electorate less educated . As the phenomenally successful Lord Northcliffe once told Daily Mail staffers , " We do n't direct the ordinary man 's opinion . We reflect it . " Though high production costs and what Williams calls " trustification " have killed more than 475 newspapers in Britain and the U.S. in the past 35 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monopoly newspaper that contains the greatest threat to local democracy now , but its circumspect neutrality in many matters where the clash of opinion is desirable . " Most newspapers ' sins of omission* and commission spring from an economic dilemma : they are torn between the journalistic duty to inform and the competitive need to entertain mass audiences which have little interest in serious news . The modern newspaper editor , says Williams , is " a blood brother to Barnum " ; his paper " a three-ring circus , daily presenting to its patrons the greatest show on earth . "
