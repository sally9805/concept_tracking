It was time for dinner , but Fred von Rekowsky , New York City " ham " radio operator , was determined not to turn off his set until he found out what the distant voice was trying to say . It seemed to want " New York only . " The static was bad , but through it he caught a murmur of soft English : " Emergency . . . to try and save a child 's life . . . " <P> Rekowsky forgot about his dinner . <P> He tried to get through to the murmuring voice : no luck . But a new voice came in strong : a fellow amateur in Clewiston , Fla. had caught the emergency message . By relay , Rekowsky pieced out a story from Oporto , Portugal . <P> There , a man named Ilidio Carlos Medina dos Santos had just read in his newspaper that a new drug , Varidase , might be just the thing for tuberculous meningitis . He wanted some , fast , for his little daughter Branca Maria . <P> Branca Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April . At first , streptomycin seemed to help her , but lately even this had begun to fail her and she was wasting away rapidly , unable to keep food down . Her father knew nothing of the controversy among medical experts about the value of Varidase , a mixture of two enzymes , streptokinase and streptodornase ( TIME , March 12 ) , in her type of illness . He was ready to try anything . <P> In New York , Operator von Rekowsky ( a lithographer when he is not at his set ) got busy . A wholesale drug supplier furnished a single vial of Varidase ; it was hustled to Idlewild airport . Within six hours of the message from Oporto , the vial was on its way to London on an Israeli airlines plane ; within a few more hours , a BOAC airliner set it down in Lisbon . Father Santos was waiting , hurried home with the vial in a Portuguese military plane . <P> An Oporto doctor gave Branca Maria an injection of Varidase , and waited to see what would happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolve clotted pus , enable an antibiotic such as streptomycin to go to work on the germs without interference . ) Within 45 minutes , Branca Maria took some food and kept it down . It was too early for the doctor to tell whether the usually fatal disease was being arrested . But Santos flew back to Lisbon , picked up a dozen more vials of Varidase to keep up the treatments . Said he : " God bless radio and aviation . Whatever happens , this has shown that there is still a love of humanity in our world . "
