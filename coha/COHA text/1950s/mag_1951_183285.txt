The momentous MacArthur hearing ended with 26 investigating Senators ( 14 Democrats , 12 Republicans ) as sharply divided as the rest of the U.S. But last week Chairman Richard Russell of Georgia , who has a talent for the common denominator , composed a careful statement , addressed to the American people , " which found a quiet note underlying the hearing 's , and the nation 's noisy ways . All 26 Senators , who are unanimous on little else , approved his statement . Wrote Russell : <P> " We do not deny that the record compiled is replete with discord and disagreement . . . We will not all be together on those conclusions . We may differ on the proper policy to be applied in the Far East . We may separate on questions of strategy . We may divide on personalities . But we will be ... single-minded in our will to preserve our institutions . We hope they may be preserved in peace , but preserve them we shall . Mistakes may add to the measure of our sacrifices or change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endure , but come what may , America has the means and the will to survive . <P> " If those who threaten us take only a tyrant 's lesson from differences among free men and mistake the temper of our people , they can plunge the world into war . . . But the issues which might divide our people are far transcended by the things which unite them . If threatened danger becomes war , the aggressor would find at one ' stroke arrayed against him the united energies , the united resources , and the united devotion of all the American people .
