SHORT NOVELS OF COLETTE ( 733 pp. - Wifh an Introduction by Glenway Wes-cott-Dial ( $5 ) . <P> <P> Henry Gauthier-Villars , known to all France at the turn of the century by his simple pseudonym , " Willy , " was regarded as the most prolific hack-writer of his day . His admirers marveled that one man could produce such a torrent of puff-pastry fiction , dramatizations , music and theater criticism , and racy personal history . Actually , Willy did nothing of the sort . He employed hacks to do his hacking ; he was squire of an estate of sharecropping " ghosts . " <P> Willy was a cynical 34 when he married 20-year-old Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette . She was the daughter of a Zouave father and . an octoroon mother , and to Willy she seemed as pure &; simple as " any little Tahitian before the missionaries got there . " After hearing her recount stories of her childhood , Willy realized that she was also a literary gold mine . He locked her in a room , gave her pen &; paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mouse . Obediently , Colette wrote . Claudine at School , her first novel , appeared in 1900 . Thereafter , every year saw a new ( and naughty ) Claudine book - Claudine stepping out , Claudine painting Paris red , Claudine in the arms of a husband ( her own ) . When Claudine was worn to the bone , Colette started the series all over again with a new heroine named Minne . The French public was fascinated and delighted by Willy 's virtuosity . For Willy , of course , signed his name to all his wife 's books . <P> Today , 78-year-old Colette 's innumerable admirers ( most of whom would agree with Glenway Wescott that she is " the greatest living French fiction writer " ) wonder how on earth their " national great lady " ever bowed to such servitude . Colette herself , now a distinguished member of the French Academy , wonders too . True , she says , Willy actually kepi her under lock &; key . But why did she not escape by the window ? Was it because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flight-and gave her a raise in salary ? Or was it , rather , that under Willy 's brutal , profiteering tutelage young Colette learned how to write ? Explained Colette years later : " Perhaps even a mouse finds time , between one wound and the next , to appreciate the softness of the cat 's paw . " <P> When at last Colette abandoned Willy , she went on the stage . Faded photographs , says Wescott , still exist of Colette as a vaudeville queen- " a black cat in woolly tights with inked-on whiskers , " a seductive charmer making a grand entry " with what appears to be a real peacock tail . " Colette left the stage to marry a distinguished politician and journalist , Henri de Jouvenel . They were divorced , and in 1935 she married her present husband , a journalist named Maurice Goudeket . But she never stopped writing . By 1919 , Marcel Proust himself was shedding tears over her love story of World War I , Mitsou .
