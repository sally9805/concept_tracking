Stocky , cheerful W. O. Hodges , 45 , was sheriff of Denton County ( pop . 41,365 ) , Texas for only four years , but he died last week a famous man . Before taking office , Hodges was just an ordinary sort of fellow ; he grew up in a little cow town named Aubrey , spent a year at Texas Christian University , got a Depression job as a cop in the county seat , went to war as a coast guardsman , came home and started running for sheriff . He made it the second time out . <P> Seven days after he took office , a farmer named Joe Allen Goforth went crazy and started down the main street of a hamlet named Krum with a .22 rifle in one hand and a shotgun in the other . He fired his shotgun at a man who was painting the bank , and then ducked into a barber shop . When the new sheriff arrived , Krum residents called : " Do n't go in there . He 's crazy . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , and called : " This is the sheriff of Denton County . Come out . " <P> The insane man fired his shotgun through the window . The sheriff fell , blinded . After a while he felt his bloody face and called out : " I ca n't stay here and bleed to death . Someone lead me away , and I 'll walk behind and shield him with my big backside . " An insurance man took the chance , and the sheriff tottered off to safety . <P> Since he could not see , most of his friends assumed that the sheriff 's career was over . He did not agree ; when he got out of the hospital , a deputy began driving him to work . He answered the sheriff 's telephone , directed the work of his six deputies , and-apparently made more sensitive to the world about him-be came a cunning interrogator of criminals . He was elected to a second term by a big majority . He ran for a third term and was elected again . <P> For a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the country consulting eye specialists . But last November , resigned to his fate , he went to Morristown , N.J. , got a fawn-colored seeing-eye dog , a boxer named Candy . Back in Denton , he started walking to his office every morning with Candy 's assistance . Last week bad luck hit the sheriff again . He had no way of knowing , as he set out for work early one morning , that he was walking through a thick fog . A jeep driver , delivering newspapers , failed to see him until too late . The car killed both man and dog . The blind sheriff had one of the biggest funerals in local history ; it was doubtful that Denton County would ever forget him .
