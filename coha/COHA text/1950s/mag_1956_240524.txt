Specialists at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington , D.C. did not try to conceal their disappointment as they repacked ten small glass slides in a wooden box one day last week . The slides had been hurried over from France by diplomatic courier in the belief that they contained a long-sought medical curio-some tissue sections removed from the kidneys of U.S. Naval Hero John Paul Jones . Undaunted , the pathologists said they had not yet begun to fight , this week resumed the search . <P> <P> Behind their efforts lay several generations of sleuthing . Until 1905 , even the whereabouts of John Paul Jones 's corpse was a mystery . After his death in Paris from nephritis in 1792 , the body of the Scot who fathered the U.S. Navy was prepared for shipment to the U.S. The limbs were encased in tinfoil ; the body was wrapped in a shroud and then was placed in a sealed , straw-and alcohol-filled lead casket . But the U.S. frugally refused to pay the freight . Hero Jones was unceremoniously buried in Paris ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite sporadic efforts over 113 years to find his body . <P> Not before U.S. Ambassador Horace Porter , a former Army general , spent $35,000 and six years to locate his remains could the U.S. reclaim its hero . <P> Well preserved by the alcohol , * Jones 's body was autopsied by Paris Pathologist Andr Victor Cornil , who snipped bits of tissue from the heart , lungs , spleen and kidneys . The lungs showed evidence of pneumonia and possibly TB , from which Jones was known to have suffered . The kidney tissue showed the effects of nephritis , from which the great captain had died . Pathologist Cornil had the kidney slides photographed ; the pictures were sent to the U.S. Congress along with Ambassador Porter 's report . <P> Although Jones 's remains were brought home in state ( they now rest in the crypt of the Naval Academy Chapel at Annapolis ) , military medics later began to wonder what had happened to the missing kidney sections . Dr. William Feldman of the Mayo Clinic last September launched the search in Paris , interrogated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some old unidentified kidney slides , and had them forwarded to the Institute of Pathology . But when matched against Cornil 's 51-year-old photos last week , the slides did not prove to be the ones ; the search is still on . <P> <P> The pathologists would like to get Hero Jones 's nephritic kidney slices for a study by paleopathologists , who try to determine the history and pattern of disease . But , as much as anything , they would like John Paul Jones 's kidneys for their famed medical museum , there to rest alongside such other patriotic exhibits as a lock of Lincoln 's hair , a slide of U.S. Grant 's throat cancer , sections of vertebrae ( complete with bullet holes ) of Assassin John Wilkes Booth and of assassinated President James A. Garfield . <P> <P> * When he died in 1805 on the deck of his Victory after Trafalgar , Lord Nelson was deposited in a cask of brandy for the long trip home . The legend that sailors tapped the cask and drank off the brandy is apparently apocryphal .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
