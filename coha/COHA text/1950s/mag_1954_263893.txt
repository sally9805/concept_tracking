Outside the Chicago Maternity Center , in the sweltering slums just south of the Loop , sidewalk vendors hawk their wares : secondhand suits , used razor blades , bottles of Dr. Pryor 's Jinx Removing Bath Crystals . After dark , dope pushers , prostitutes and gangs of toughs prowl the soiled asphalt . Yet , unlike cops and truant officers , center staffers are seldom molested in the neighborhood . Even the hoods greet them on their rounds . <P> The Chicago Maternity Center is unlike any other clinic in the U.S. Instead of taking expectant mothers to already-jammed charity wards , the center 's delivery teams sally forth like commandos into the cramped , airless homes of the city 's poor . Day or night , they never refuse a call . Despite the high percentage of last-minute cases , the teams have compiled a striking record : in more than 8,339 home deliveries during the last 30 months , no mother has died . Of some 300 pathological cases requiring hospitalization , only three have proved fatal . <P> Most Good on a Shoestring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Bolivar De Lee , the center has always operated on a shoestring ( 1954 budget : $225,000 , from the Community Fund and individual contributions ) , nevertheless has delivered some 104,000 babies , trained 1,154 doctors and 12,000 medical students . The men and women on its staff ( two residents , six assistant residents , 15 medical students ) go about their jobs in ordinary street clothes , travel by bus or in their own cars to deliver babies , as one nurse put it , " just about everywhere except in the maternity shop at Marshall Field 's . " Says tall , greying Dr. Beatrice E. Tucker , who , as Founder De Lee 's successor , has been with the center 22 years : " This is the most fascinating neighborhood I know . You are located exactly where you can do the most good . " <P> The center 's gospel , laid down by Founder De Lee , is absolute cleanliness in the midst of squalor . As a sanitary aid , the delivery crews pack two odd accessories : newspapers and empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rolled into bolsters to shield the mother from outside germs . Explains the center 's Co-Director Dr. Harry B. Benaron : " We do n't say that newspapers are germfree , but they are certainly cleaner than the sheets we find in the average home . " <P> One hot day last fortnight , the newspapers and beer bottles-and the skill of the delivery team-were put to a greater test than usual . A call came in to the center 's switchboard asking for a doctor to attend a Puerto Rican woman a half-hour 's drive away . Quickly , a delivery crew assembled : Spanish-born Dr. Esteban Martin Martin . University of Wisconsin Medical Student Marvin Hinke and two visiting nurses . They picked up their black bags and set out in Dr. Martin 's car . When it broke down ( Martin 's diagnosis : " Vascular ailment of the gas line " ) , the crew hiked the rest of the way to the patient 's apartment .                    @
