Like any other new boy at St. Paul 's School in Concord , N.H. , dark-eyed , curly-haired Abdallah Lakfal , going on 14 , bounced with excitement last week as the school year got under way . A sixth-former helped him settle in his dorm , showed him the chapel and local stores , escorted him to the gym , where he drew athletic equipment . Then " Abdie " took a series of physical examinations , visited the library , met his teachers and headmaster , the Rev. Matthew Warren , received his first homework assignment . But for the little boy from Casablanca it also meant something special : the start of at least a year 's stay in the U.S. <P> It began last winter when Diplomat Julius Holmes stopped in Morocco on a special assignment in Africa . As onetime U.S. representative in Tangier , Holmes had a special affection for Morocco ; as an alumnus of St. Paul 's , he felt a sentimental tie to his old school . So he decided to bring the two together . U.S. Information Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moulay Hassan school faculty to suggest a student for a St. Paul 's scholarship . The faculty unanimously chose Abdallah . <P> Hi for Salaam . At 13 , Abdie faced a perplexing problem . Living with his widowed mother in neat poverty in the New Medina ( a Moslem quarter ) of Casablanca , he was told " if you leave , you 'll break your mother 's heart . " But if he stayed in Morocco , where only a fraction of the children get past elementary school , he might end up like his father who was an office messenger until he died . So Abdie found a solution : he persuaded his older brother to let one of his own children live with his mother while he is away . <P> But it was not all that easy . Although USIS officials had pronounced him fluent in English , Abdie would have a long way to go to hold his own with U.S. prep schoolers . He was put through every textbook in the USIS language center , and when he was officially awarded the scholarship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of Consul General Henry H. Ford . Consul Robert Sherwood took him home to play with his two boys , aged 7 and 11 . Soon Abdie replaced salaam with " hi . " <P> Stateroom &; Sundaes . Other problems existed besides language . His entire wardrobe consisted of one jacket , one pair of slacks , one pair of shoes , two pairs of blue jeans . But by the St. Paul 's catalogue , he needed a much fuller list of clothes , including winter boots and coats . Charles Stafford , a tavern owner from Laconia , N.H. visiting Morocco on a trade mission , met the boy , decided to help . He went home and raised $500 from his state 's Rotary Clubs . Adeline Martin , a clerical worker at the Nouasseur air-base near Casablanca , sold the Volkswagen she had won in a raffle , donated a third of her take to outfit the boy . Finally , the American Export Lines booked Abdie in the owner 's stateroom aboard the S.S. Examiner . The trip was set . <P> Until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill up the gaps in Abdie 's American background . He was taught about George Washington 's cherry tree , taken to the Air Force snack bar and instructed in ice-cream sundaes . There was an eleventh-hour panic when it was discovered that he knew nothing about Paul Revere . But he worked hard and remembered it all . Said Bardos : " He has a mind like a sponge .
