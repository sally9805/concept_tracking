Tickets to such Broadway hit musicals as South Pacific , Guys and Dolls and Call Me Madam are still harder to get than rush-hour seats in the Manhattan subways . But , for roughly the price of a ticket , a theater fan anywhere can hear the shows tunes just as they sound from the stage without stirring from the living-room sofa . <P> In ten years , original-cast recordings of Broadway scores have boomed into big business by appealing to 1 ) those who can not see the shows , and 2 ) theatergoers who want something more than a playbill to remember them by . Columbia Records has sold 980,000 copies of South Pacific ( at from $4.85 to $8.87 an album ) for about $6,500,000 . The Broadway show itself has grossed less than $5,000,000 . Decca 's 1943 Oklahoma ! , still going strong , heads the bestseller list at over 1,000,000 copies , and its new Guys and Dolls is selling faster than Oklahoma ! did in its heyday . <P> Decca 's late president , Jack Kapp , fathered the original-cast musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company has set the pace ever since ( Carousel , Call Me Mister , Annie Get Your Gun ) . But the competition is furious . Producers ' royalties have shot up to 10% per record , and producers switch unpredictably to different labels as they bring out new shows . RCA Victor cinched the rights to Call Me Madam by financing the musicomedy for $225,000 , but had to do without Star Ethel Merman , whose recording contract committed her to do the songs for Decca . <P> With too few new musical hits to feed a hungry demand , the leading companies have gone off in new directions . Columbia has fattened its current catalogue ( Kiss Me Kate , Out of This World , Gentlemen Prefer Blondes ) by recording older shows in their original spirit , mostly with new performers : 1931 's The Bandwagon , 1934 's Anything Goes ( both with Mary Martin ) . Awaiting release : 1940 's Pal Joey with the original 's Vivienne Segal , and 1934 's Conversation Piece with Author Noel Coward and Lily Pons . Decca is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts : T. S. Eliot 's The Cocktail Party , Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman and , soon to be issued , The Lady 's Not for Burning , which Poet-Playwright Christopher Fry conveniently wrote even more for the ear than the eye .
