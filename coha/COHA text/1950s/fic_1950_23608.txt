string , as in the early days in Korea , prepares JO him inwardly for disaster , and he complains bitterly that he has been let down  --  where are the reinforcements , where is the equipment , where is the stuff ? This is partly psychological . Take away the accustomed machinery  --  the Quartermaster shower units , the USO shows , the Red Cross doughnut trucks  --  and there is no longer visible evidence that the full strength of the United States has been committed . With all credit to the approach that will expend materiel at any point to save the lives of soldiers , a great deal of military paraphernalia is useless ; the terrible thing is that we have become accustomed to it . Throughout World War II the American infantryman went into battle overburdened with junk . The troops who staged for the invasion of North Africa brought so much dunnage to the ports that there was not room enough for it in the ships ( in response to this information , the War Department authorized a larger barracks bag ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavier combat load than the Redcoats who stumbled up Bunker Hill , in some cases including four cartons of cigarettes per man . Soldiers were landed on hostile beaches in both theaters with nine packages of K-rations where one would have been enough , often with over ten pounds of grenades that less than 6 per cent of them would ever use , and eighty or more rounds of ammunition that would never be in short supply wherever they went . These figures and many more like them have been carefully collected by an angry man , Colonel S. L. A. Marshall of the Detroit News , who was an army historian both in Europe and the Pacific . He would like to see some changes made . Not only did overloading of men cause many casualties ( Colonel Marshall believes more at Omaha Beach than enemy fire ) , but it encouraged the prodigal wastage that sent supply statistics up into the logistical stratosphere . In World War II we wasted more material in Europe than the AEF of World War I consumed in its entire operation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had an oversupply of ridiculous luxuries . " The approaches to Antwerp , " writes Colonel Marshall , " were cleared at last in the early winter of 1944 . The first ships arrived in late No-vember . In the early shipments came large quantities of cased Coca-Cola . " I T is no longer possible to afford the largesse that put ten tons of supply behind every man in the European theater ; we are sim-ply not that rich . The industrial resources of the country , however enlarged since 1941 , are not endless , and the strain of an all-out war of materiel could quickly make us a " have-not " nation . Stockpiling of scarce and strategic substances was 60 per cent behind anticipated needs in July . In May General Vandenberg gave his opinion that if war came the Air Force would have to fight for a year and a half with what it now has . Today it takes twice as many man-hours per pound of airframe to build a bomber , and the average weight of the planes is twice as great  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in World War II for a single machine . In 1944 the initial cost of an infantry division was 14 million dollars ; today it would be 75 million . An armored division that would have cost 30 million dollars in 1944 would now cost 200 million . These costs can not be cut , nor can we build an Army without tanks and bombers . Eliminating equipment is less important than eliminating the numbers of ineffectively employed soldiers who soak it up . We must stop using gobbledygook phrases like " utilization of manpower " and learn how to use men . We must reduce  --  mercilessly , this can not be compromised  --  the size of rear-area organizations , whose purpose is largely to push forward the avalanche of supply , whose life unfits them for the moments of actual combat that guerrilla warfare will bring their way , and whose boredom creates a demand for further luxuries to keep them from going rock-happy with a sense of their own unimportance .

This does not mean creating an elite , for the Army ( unlike the Marines ) must always be capable of indefinite expansion ; it can not put all its best in one division . What this does mean is a brutal process of hacking , slicing , and dismembering throughout the Army , from top to bottom , at every extra man , extra gadget , extra function that can possibly be dispensed with . The ideal of universal employability has been achieved in the past . " Every Roman soldier , " wrote Polybius , " once under arms and on duty , is equally well adapted for dealing with every kind of terrain and situation and emergency . . . whether he is called upon to take part in a general or a partial engagement , or to go into action by companies , or to carry on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must become , will have one other important characteristic . If it is truly light it will be potentially airborne  --  not specially and expensively trained to be airborne , but built on the principle of lightness , airborne over-all . D o NOT overestimate the enemy . It is pathetic that l60 million Americans and Canadians , allied with 275 million Europeans , and sharing between them most of the wealth and power of mankind , should tremble before a half-developed country which by 1960 , after two more Five-Year Plans , will have reached the industrial position of the United States in 1915 . H. A. DeWeerd , in the Reporter , has shown how exaggerated were the figures for German and Japanese strength widely circulated during the time of their victories . He suggests that we are guilty of the same overemphasis in solemnly assuring one another that the Russians have the largest strategic air force , the largest tactical air force , the largest air-transport service , and the largest force of infantry and armored divisions in the world . While in some categories this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been military but political . In guerrilla war one political attitude is essential . Major Robert B. Rigg , who observed the Chinese Communists from both sides in the Civil War and accompanied the Iraqi Army on a campaign against the Kurds , has summarized it in the Combat Forces Journal : You 'll hate them , but when they are captured do n't hurt them . . . they should be treated as prisoners of war . .. . Guerrillas depend a lot on the local population . And so it 's essential to get the local people on your side . Napoleon and Hitler lacked such a policy . The partisans may resort to techniques of terror by burning villages and killing hostages , but here they ape Hitler and you can turn this to your advantage . Remember the people and enlist their help . It will save you time and effort . You 'll never succeed without them . Anywhere that a Communist army fights guerrilla war among a population with the slightest , or even the most misguided , sympathy for their aims , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their political offensive with one of our own . The brutal and senseless display of technical superiority , or of Pukka Sahib attitude by an American commander , undoes in a moment any number of leaflets , radio broadcasts , and enlightened speeches at Lake Success . If there is any way of conducting ourselves before the millions of Asia that will gain their confidence , it is to fight our own fights when the time comes , with an Army that does not throw in their faces at every moment the contrast between our wastefulness and their need , our destructive technology and their industrial poverty . For if this war ever becomes one of Machines vs . People , with the United States on the side of the Machines , we shall most surely lose it . Wars are fought with machines , and we shall need them to win ; but far more important is the courage and resourcefulness of men , and it is a matter of international interest which of the two  --  people or machines  --  the Americans most deeply believe in .

A light Army , supported by true and general understanding of the infantryman 's job , can fight as many wars on the Korean pattern as the Soviets may choose to start and still do credit to the nation . It is the only kind of Army that can win political victories . It is certainly the only kind of Army that can save us from the terrible verdict of history ( quoted by Colonel Marshall ) that was rendered by a German general on the reasons for French failure in 1870 : The people had always concentrated on material questions . They thought that the offensive power of the enemy would be broken by the defensive action of new and terrible weapons . They ruined in that way the spirit of their Army . The Reasonable Music A Story by John Cheever Drawings by John Grath S AWYER got off the train from Cincinnati early on Sunday afternoon and carried his heavy valise and sample case to the hotel nearest the railroad station , the old Viaduct House . The desk clerk was bald and mulish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said sourly that the only vacancy was in the annex . The empty lobby and the stillness everywhere made this difficult to believe , but he followed an even older man up three flights of stairs and then down a long passage into a room with a warped , thin door , a room that seemed to him to be the merest shelter . The elderly bellhop had started back down the passage when Sawyer called after him in desperation and asked if there was anything to do in that city on a Sunday afternoon . The old man said that theaters , movies , saloons , museums , even * ball games were forbidden in that territory on the Sabbath . After he was left alone Sawyer took his suits out of the valise and hung them up and then stood in the middle of the room , absolutely lost in its bleakness like a passenger who has fallen unnoticed from the deck of . a transatlantic liner . It was three o'clock by his watch . He looked through an open door into the bathroom . The fixtures were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he heard footsteps approaching in the passage and someone slipped a telegram under his door . It was the night letter his wife had promised to send him each Saturday , now that the exigencies of earning and spending kept him away from home . " WE ARE ALL WELL AND HAPPY , " she wired . " HOPE You ARE SAME STOP WENT To MOVIES AT STRAND LAST NIGHT WITH CHILDREN STOP EARLY To BED STOP LOVE AND Gon BLESS You . " This affectionate and homely message moved him deeply , as he received it in that forsaken bedroom , and he sat down  --  a family man  --  to recall with longing those Sunday afternoons which he had spent watering his lawn and watching his children play tennis . Sawyer had lost his job on his fortieth birthday and after six months of looking for another and finding nothing he had been forced to try his luck as a traveling salesman . His life before this had been one of extraordinary contentment and confinement . He had gladly followed the comings and goings of a suburban commuter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office in the morning and returned happily in the evening to walk up the leafy streets from the station to the house where his family and his dinner were waiting ; and to have exchanged these easy-going ways for the reek of Pullman mattresses and the gloom of the Viaduct House was a displacement that he had not yet been able to accept . It still hurt him to think that in the evening ahead of him the people he most loved , meeting for supper in a room whose windows opened onto a garden , would miss him as intensely as he , who would cat his evening meal alone , would miss them . He had been on the road three weeks and this loneliness was still all keen and strange to him . T HERE was nothing in Sawyer 's appear-ance that would make a stranger take him for a salesman . His prematurely white hair and his handsome and solemn face reflected his lasting attachments to one wife , one family , one business , one part of the world . Now he took off his coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was unlacing his shoes when he noticed that the room was close and that the bed and the upholstered chair smelled strongly of a spent perfume . He crossed the room and opened the window . The hot street was perfectly still . In the mountains , in the summer , at the close of a windy day , at all the best times of his life , it had seemed to him that he could feel the earth under his feet stir and turn , but here was the opposite of that pleasure . The light beat down directly onto the buildings . It seemed as if the local custom of a chicken dinner and a nap had affected the passage of the sun . Turning away from the window he noticed a calendar on the wall . Above the small table of numbered days and quartered moons was a picture of a naked girl , kneeling in a flood of violet light . The light colored her thighs , her fine belly , and the lower half of her perfect and lucent breasts , and Sawyer wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a flawless and supple woman with so fine a skin . He guessed that he had n't . On the desk below the calendar there was an ashtray filled with cigarette butts , half of them stained with lipstick , and when he dumped these into the wastebasket he was reminded again of the strangers who had recently occupied the room by two empty whiskey bottles there . They must have had a time . He lighted a cigar and sat in his underwear , trying to figure a way out of the idleness that lay between him and the next morning . Earlier in the trip he had been able to make friends or to distract himself with the resources of a livelier city ; with one thing and another this was probably the first time in thirty years that lie had found himself alone . Nov there are many men whose fortunes and chances from the day of their birth surround them with affectionate and watchful people . Sawyer was one of these . He had not aimed particularly at gregariousness but it had been his luck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , did he find himself idle and alone . His inexperience in idleloneliness made him look for some significance in the vacant afternoon as if the silence put a question . That there was no one in the city outside the hotel who knew his name , that his anonymity for the first time in years was nearly perfect , struck him as a fact of the moment . He did not make any more movement than it took him to smoke a cigar , but the hushed and dismal room seemed to work on his character , returning him to a frame of mind so remote that he could not honestly have named it . He took a newspaper he had bought and read on the train , the night before , and stretched out on the bed . That part of the room was dark and as he reached up to turn on the light he noticed that , written in pencil on the wallpaper in a crude hand , was I LOVE YOU l LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU . This tenderness amused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette butts arid whiskey bottles , and wondered who the lovers had been and where they had gone . He searched through the newspaper for some business failure or sports prophecy he had missed on his earlier reading and he read assiduously . But still the time hardly seemed to pass . When he had finished reading the paper for a second time he rolled it up and used it to kill a fly . He treed his shoes and dusted them with a soiled handkerchief . He sat on the windowsill and then in the chair . Not until six o'clock did the light in the street begin to change and give him reason to believe that the terrible afternoon was ending . At half past six he went into the bathroom and carefully shaved . Then he ran the water for a bath and while he was sitting on the edge of the tub , waiting for it to fill , he saw that the lovers , whoever they were , had been there too . Written on the wall beside the tub was I LOVE YOU I LOVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed it with a washcloth and he guessed that they had left only recently . He took a bath and put on a fresh cotton suit and went downstairs . T IIERE was a sign COFFEE POT , and an arrow leading out of the lobby , and he followed this into a restaurant that had once obviously been a store . He was the only customer . The makeshift chairs and tables , the thin curtains along the broad window , the green glass ashtrays all reminded him of the guest rooms in summer cottages . The atmosphere was spare and maidenly and he was surprised when the waitress who came out of the kitchen appeared to be a voluptuous and good-natured woman . " We have n't got the kidney saute , " she said and , leaning over to scratch this off the menu , she brushed his shoulder with hers . " All we 've got is the chicken pot pie , " she said . " Do you live here ? " he said . " What do you mean ? Here ? In this coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure . I live in this city . I live in this hotel . Right upstairs , " she said . " What do you do when you get through work ? " " Tonight when I get through work I 'm going to take off my shoes and go to bed . In two hours , " she said . " I 've never been here before . Is n't there any place where I can get a drink or see . a movie ? " " There 's a band concert . Fenton Park , " she said . " Anything else ? " " You want the chicken pie ? " " Yes . " " You want a drink ? " she said . " Sure . " " Hat17 ' 11 get you one . He 's the old man out at the desk . He 'll get you a bottle . " " I do n't want to drink alone . " N " Anybody ever tell you you look like George Washington ? " she asked . " Yes . Lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink with you any other night but tonight , George , " she said . ' ' Tomorrow night maybe , tomorrow night , but tonight I 'm so tired I 'm dizzy . My head 's falling off . " She went into the kitchen for his chicken pie . He ate it greedily , drank some coffee , and paid her with a twenty-dollar bill . " I ca n't change that , " she said . Then he gave her a ten , then a five and she came back to the table with the change from this . " I 'll show you where to get a drink tomorrow night , " she said . " ' Tonight . " " I tell you I ca n't . I been on my feet since nine o'clock . I did n't get to sleep until after three . I ca n't . " " Tonight , " he said . " I tell you I ca n't . " The big weary woman stood close and smiled at him with her lined eyes , but she kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a soft midsummer night . H E WALKED for a long time away from ' the station and the Viaduct House and when he came to a part of the city where the streets were broader , he saw that there was still an intense and sere light in the western sky that he had not been able to see from the neighborhood of the Viaduct House , and as this light became dimmer and more pure , and as the darkness in the streets massed and deepened , he felt that this change from light to dark had on the city , and on himself , some moral effect , as if his mature conscience was being- weakened by the disappearing light and the summer night whose mildness he could feel through his clothing . The fact that he was unknown in the city occurred to him again . Then he saw the trees of a park ahead of him , darker than the night itself , and so full it seemed of what he desired that he hastened toward it , and when he stepped from the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was painful . Balls of pale light hung in the dark . The dark walks were crowded and beyond the talk of the crowd he heard catcalls , shrill catcalls , and saw on the grass everywhere couples in one another 's arms . The unrelieved salaciousness of the night confounded him , and he stood by the side of the walk , watching the girls go by : a fair girl with heavy eyebrows , a girl with a book in her hand , a girl whose face had the freshness and the roundness of a child 's face , a girl with fat , pretty lips , a girl who seemed to have been crying , a girl who had washed her hair , a couple of girls speaking Spanish , a girl in tight slacks , an ugly girl smiling and listening to what the man she was with was saying as if this was all that mattered , as if the earth had fallen away . Then on the wind he heard a bar Of band music and he began to walk deeper into the park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on benches , talking and wait- ing for the musicians . The program had reached an intermission . There was no person on the bandstand , but below the array of lighted and empty chairs he could see the musicians in white coats , grouped in twos and threes , smoking and talking . People were coming and going but the odd domesticity of the scene did n't lessen the strain he felt . While he stood there a girl spoke to him . " There going to be any more music , you know ? " she asked . " I do n't know , " he said . " I 've never been here before . " " This is the first time I been here this summer , " she said . She wore a sweater , slacks , and golden sandals , and her breath smelled of whiskey . She was young . " It 's nice though , " she said . " I mean these people who live in hot tenements , it 's nice that they can cool off and listen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I used to come here all the time , " she said , and then she added nicely , and with some self-importance , as if the city were friendly and small : " I been away , you know . . ? " " Really . Where ? " " Denver , " she said . " Is that your home ? " " No . " She smoothed her slacks frankly , in response to the way he was looking at her , and began to rock back and forth on her heels . " My home 's in Virginia . " " What part ? " " West Virginia 's my birthplace . My people
