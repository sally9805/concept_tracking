txt ATTORNEY EJECTED ON M'CARTHY ORDER Senator Charges Unger With Filibustering ' Instead of Answering Questions By WILLIAM R. CONKLIN Abraham Unger , a lawyer of 11 Park Place , was forcibly ejected yesterday from a Federal courtroom1 here by order of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , Republican of Wisconsin , for " filibustering " instead of answering the Senator 's questions . The . action reflected Mr. McCarthy 's impatience with a long life of balky witnesses who had refused to answer questions by invoking the Fifth Amendment , which provides that no one " shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . " The courts have interpreted this to mean that a witness is not required to give testimony that may tend to incriminate him . As further evidence of his " get tougher " policy with such witnesses , Mr. McCarthy , chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , said that he would seek to have the application of the Fifth Amendment narrowed to preclude the use of it as a cloak for " the Communist conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness was entitled to the Fifth Amendment 's protection when he believed that a truthful answer would indeed - Vend to incriminate him . Mr. McCarthy asserted that he would bring contempt of the Sen , // ate charges against Mr. Unger and David M. Freedman , who are law partners . Referring to Mr. Unger , he said : " We heard this witness on Thursday and asked him two simple questions . One was whether he was a member of the Communist party and the other was whether he had organized- a professional group within the party . He spoke for seventy minutes without answering either question . " I 'm not going to waste time itn him this morning unless he wants to deny the testimony we have received about him . I 'm not going to listen to his type of filibuster . " " You have to decide for yourself , Mr. Senator , whether you want a witness or not , " Mr. Unger broke in , moving toward the witness chair in the Federal Courthouse on Foley Square . Two Guards Eject Lawyer " Remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards . Mr. Unger struggled a bit as the guards seized his arms and moved him backward , but then went along . Hisses broke out among the 150 spectators at the hearing , and one voice was heard saying : " Throw him out ! " " I take this , " Mr. Unger told the Senator , " as an indication that you do not want me as a witness . " " I wo n't allow a Communist lawyer to use this courtroom as a transmission belt , " the chairman replied . Turning to Bernard Jaffe , Mr. Unger 's counsel , Senator McCarthy said that he would permit the witness to testify if he wanted to reply to testimony by John Lautner , a former Communist functionary , who was yesterday 's first witness . Mr. Lautner identified Mr. Unger and Mr. Freedman , as " Communist party functionaries " who had aided in the expulsion of Dr. Bella Dodd from the party . Dr. Dodd has testified before the Senate Internal Security subcommittee that she was a former member of the Communist party 's national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party in 1949 . Dr. Dodd testified that she had joined the party in 1943 but had been closely associated with it since 1932 . She taught political science and economy at Hunter College from 1926 to 1938 . " I 'm not going to let Mr. Unger repeat what he did yesterday , " Senator McCarthy insisted . " If he wants to testify , he can do that , but I wo n't have him come in and raise objections to answering questions . He can testify yes , no , or claim the Fifth Amendment . I am giving him the privilege of not answering anything he considers unfair or untrue . But I do n't want to hear any lecture from him today . " Senator McCarthy then said that he would ask the full subcommittee to recommend to the Senate a " narrowing " of the application of the Fifth Amendment , adding : " The Fifth Amendment was enacted originally to protect the rights of individuals . It is now being used by those who seek to protect the Communist conspiracy . My position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fifth Amendment when a truthful answer may tend to incriminate him , but not just any answer . " ' Unger Statement . Barred Senator McCarthy refused Mt . Jaffe 's request that a statement from Mr. Unger be incorporated in the hearing record . Mr. Unger later gave the statement to reporters outside the hearing room . " His refusal to hear me after ' having subpoenaed me and having Insisted upon my appearance is ' proof positive to me , " the statement said , " that he was afraid to make public my testimony of the day before , in which I had answered all questions fully , and in which I had objected on legal and constitutional grounds to any inquiry into political opinions and beliefs . " During the questioning , Senator McCarthy made clear that he was inquiring into " the Communist conspiracy , " rather than directing questions toward " poltical beliefs . " The chairman made this specific when Mr. Freedman was on the stand . The witness was asked about Julius Reiss , ' a United States citizen who is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Unger-Freedman law firm , according to a record produced by Roy M. Cohn , chief subcommittee counsel , had paid Mr. Reiss $2,457 in 1949-50 for research work on the trial of the eleven top Communist leaders who were convicted of conspiring to teach and advo= cate the overthrow of the Government by . force and violence . " Do you regard the Communist party as a conspiracy ? " Senator McCarthy asked Mr. Freedman . " What I think about the Communist party is of no concern to this committee , " the witness replied . " Yes , it is a concern to this committee , " the Senator asserted . " You had working for you a top functionary of the Communist party who is now working for the Polish delegation in the United Nations , and you are a lawyer entitled to practice in the Federal courts . Your law partner told us yesterday that any member of the Communist party should be proud of it . Why are you ashamed to admit it ? " When the witness balked , the chairman said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world that you are a Communist , because a truthful answer would not tend to incriminate you in any way . " " Some courts and judges have held that Communist party activities are criminal , " the witness said . " Knowing that , I must refuse to answer your question . " " Are you a member of the Communist party today ? " Mr. McCarthy asked . " I refuse to answer under the Fifth Amendment , " Mr. Freedman said . At another point , the witness invoked the First , Ninth and Tenth Amendments , finally coming to rest on the Fifth as his basis for refusal to answer . The First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion , speech and the press in addition to peaceful assembly and the right to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . According to the Ninth Amendment , " the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construced to deny or disparage others retained by the people . " Under the Tenth Amendment , the powers not delegated to the United States nor prohibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " states respectively or to the people . " Mr. Freedman objected to the television lights and flashlight bulbs , whereupon Senator McCarthy ordered the lights turned off him and banned the taking of still pictures . " I 'm not a performer , Senator , " the witness asserted . " I am not accustomed to acting under the ' lights . " When he was first asked about Communist party membership , Mr. Freedman said : " I consider that a very impertinent question , and one wholly outside the scope of this committee 's United Nations investigation . You have no basis for inquiring . It is clear to me that you brought me here because you wanted to put this question to me . " It is an interference with the work of attorneys . I am responsible to the courts for what I am and what I do . Neither this com-I mittee nor any other committee of Congress has the right to inquire into my political associations . " Mr. McCarthy noted for the record the presence of Frank H. Gordon , chief counsel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City of New York . The Senator said that Mr. Gordon was there as an observer and was not bound by anything the subcommittee said or did . Senator McCarthy commended the American Bar Association for its recent statement that Communist lawyers should be disbarred , then said that he was glad the New . York bar was interested in his subcommittee 's work . Mr. Gordon said that he would obtain a copy of the hearing record for submission to the grievance committee . Party Functionary Defined Mr. Lautner earlier told the subcommittee that a Communist party functionary was " a dedicated-person , a professional revolutionary and thus different from the ordinary Communist party member . " The witness is a former member of the party 's National Review Commission and its New York State Review Commission . Mr. Lautner testified that Communist lawyers owed their " highest duty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism , and to the aims and objectives of the Communist party ? everything else is relegated . " He identified Messrs . Unger . Freedman and Reiss as party functionaries . The hearing ended a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Monday when the subcommittee will meet in executive session in Washington . The group tentatively plans , to return to New York about Sept. 23 . Harold Rainville , assistant to ' Senator Everett M. Dirksen , Re- ' publican of Illinois , and Robert , Jones , assistant to Senator Charles E. Potter , Republican of Michigan , sat in on the hearing . Mr. Rainville and Mr. Jones said that the two absent Senators , who are spbcom- ' mittee members , were reached by telephone and were inclined to side with Senator McCarthy 's effort to , narrow the application of the Fifth Amendment when it was invoked by balky witnesses .
