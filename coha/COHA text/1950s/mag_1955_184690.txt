London 's respected , influential weekly Economist , temperate in most matters , last week ran a characteristically considered editorial note : " We have for some time been trying to discover why it is that copies of The Economist sent by mail to subscribers in the United States are so late in delivery . An explanation has recently been received from the U.S. Post Office . It appears that all foreign publications are forwarded to the Bureau of Customs for review under the Customs Tariff Art of 1930 as possible propaganda matter . Investigations by a Post Office inspector have disclosed that , owing to the large volume of incoming foreign mail which must be examined , a backlog has accumulated , and it is understood that at times the examining unit has been considerably in arrears in ' processing the mails . ' We feel that comment by us on this state of affairs might be in bad taste , and is certainly superfluous . "
