Across nine states , from Texas to Iowa , some 1,300 gas stations in the next few weeks will break out in a bright new color scheme-the shiny blue-and-white gas pumps of a bustling Belgian-born newcomer , American Petrofina . The first major foreign investor in U.S. oil since Shell , Petrofina has grown from only a plan on paper to $100 million in assets in less than two years , now feels strong enough to put its own " Fina " brand name on the gas stations it has picked up . <P> This week it closed the third major deal of its move into U.S. oil with the purchase of the oil holdings of Floyd Odium 's Atlas Corp. , for about $20 million , in a cash and stock swap . This deal runs its oil reserves up to 40 million bbl. , gas to 275 billion cu . ft. , crude production to 10,000 bbl. a day , and refinery capacity to 50,000 bbl. a day . <P> American Petrofina is expanding at a time when the petroleum industry is in a general slump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody is down in the doldrums . " <P> Operation in the doldrums is nothing new to Petrofina ( full name : Compagnie Financiere Beige des Petroles ) . Says Managing Director Laurent Wolters in Brussels : " We consider that the time to buy is when things are bad , because you can get them at a reasonable price . Industry-wise , the situation is dreadful , but our situation is good . " On a global level , the policy has worked well . Stripped of almost everything but its name after World War II , when the Communists nationalized its Rumanian oilfields , Petrofina swapped its license to refine in France with British Petroleum for a guaranteed supply of crude , revitalized affiliates , merged , swapped and bought outright until it has now expanded into 63 affiliates in 23 countries , selling some 150,000 bbl. of oil a day . <P> Petrofina came into the U.S. by way of Canada . There , in 1950 , it set up a production company , and in 1953 established Canadian Petrofina , which rapidly ran its assets up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to new gas stations ( TIME , July 9 , 1956 ) , moved into fourth place ( behind Imperial , British American and Shell ) among Canada 's gas and oil distributors . <P> In 1956 it set up a U.S. affiliate . With initial capitalization of $38 million , chiefly from U.S. investors , American Petrofina , which is controlled by the Belgian parent company through its control of the board of directors , bought control of Texas ' Panhandle Oil for $25 million in 1956 , and in 1957 picked up Texas ' American Liberty Oil Co. for about $32 million . <P> But while the buying has been spectacular , earnings have been moderate ; 1957 will show a net of $1.5 million on a gross of $45 million , and U.S. oilmen are watching the bumptious newcomer with some skepticism . But confident Harry Jackson , a veteran of 34 years with Tidewater and manager of its Eastern division when Petrofina hired him in 1956 , plans to continue expanding .                @ @ @ @ @
