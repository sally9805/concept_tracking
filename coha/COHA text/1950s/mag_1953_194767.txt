THE PRESIDENT-ELECT Hopes &; Hoppes <P> At Eisenhower headquarters in New York 's Commodore Hotel last week , Christmas jollity manifested itself chiefly in the bounding of plastic grasshoppers . An old and previously unnamed plaything , the toy grasshopper , which has springy metal legs and a rubber suction cup on its belly , was promptly christened " the Eisen-hopper " by fascinated newsmen . Introduced into Ike 's offices by his old friend , Toy Manufacturer Louis Marx , the Eisenhopper caught the President-elect 's fancy . Talking business with serious-faced guests , Ike would casually press a hopper on to his desk , and roar with delight when , seconds later , it startled the visitors by springing ceilingward . <P> Apart from the antics of the Eisenhopper , the first half of Christmas week offered the President-elect little opportunity for relaxation . Following the dictates of courtesy and good politics , Ike sought out the nation 's last Republican President , Herbert Hoover , and spent an hour and a half lunching with him at John Foster Dulles ' home , where the Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters and photographers , the two Republican chieftains , both in blue cashmere overcoats and wearing nearly identical light blue ties , were carefully unspecific about their conversation . <P> " Just a social gathering at which we went over the affairs of government , " said Ike . <P> Including reorganization of government ? asked a reporter . " That and many other things , " answered Ike as he led Hoover to a waiting limousine . <P> For 2 days Ike ran through a jam packed series of appointments dominated by men whose chief concern was the struggle against world Communism . At noontime on the day before Christmas , however , he temporarily abandoned his office with the avowed hope of spending a good , family holiday . That evening , as he helped to decorate the Eisenhower tree and fill his grandchildren 's stockings , there seemed no reason why his hope should n't come true . But Christmas morning he awoke to the unsettling news that Stalin , through the New York Times , had expressed willingness to meet with him . <P> Fencing off press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike and Mamie went off to a Christmas service at the Columbia University chapel . <P> After the service , Chaplain John McGill Krumm expressed his regret that Ike was soon to give up the presidency of Columbia . " I hate to see you go , " said Dr. <P> Krumm , then , realizing that he may have indicated he was a Stevenson man , added hastily " in a way . " Replied Ike , laughing at Krumm 's discomfort : " I hate to go , too-in a way . " Then he and Mamie went home to join the rest of the family around the Christmas tree . Obviously preoccupied , Ike paced about uneasily for a while before he settled down to playing with Grandson Dwight David 's new electric train ( see NEWS IN PICTURES ) .
