New Mexico 's Ambrosia Lake is a misnamed patch of sunbaked , bone-dry limestone where miners have long thought they smelled uranium . The Santa Fe Railway opened a small strip mine near by in 1950 , and Anaconda Co. began to work the richest U.S. uranium mine 20 miles southeast of Ambrosia Lake . But no one struck it rich in Ambrosia Lake until 1955 . Then a young ( 31 ) Texan named Louis B. Lothmann came in with a $10,000 grubstake , two years of college geology and a hunch on where to look . He teamed up with Septuagenarian Stella Dysart , an oil wildcatter , who knew every corner of the 72-sq. - mi. area from her 30 unsuccessful years of oil hunting . Using Stella 's drilling logs of rock formations and a rickety , secondhand rig , Lou Lothmann cut down 360 ft. into a 17-ft. - thick seam of uranium on Dysart land . That started the rush . In the past two years , the region around Ambrosia Lake and the neighboring town of Grants has been found to contain more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area is being built into the nation 's most important uranium-processing center . <P> Last week Ambrosia Lake got another big lift . Phillips Petroleum Co. , which is sinking two mines there , contracted with the Atomic Energy Commission to build a $9,500,000 mill to process 1,725 tons of ore a day into uranium concentrate . Like many another oil producer , Phillips is hedging its bets against the day that uranium becomes a major source of the world 's energy . <P> Dividends . For the prospectors who uncovered its wealth , Ambrosia Lake has already started to issue dividends . Lou Lothmann sold out his original interest in the Dysart land to Rio de Oro Uranium Mines , Inc. for $200,000 in stock . Stella Dysart sold part of her share to Rio de Oro for $300,000 in stock , still holds a 12% royalty interest . <P> They-and most other prospectors who followed them in staking claims-sold out because Ambrosia Lake 's uranium is down too deep ( 350 ft. to 1,500 ft. ) for their own limited resources .

This December , Homestake also will finish a 750-ton mill , under construction in partnership with J. H.
