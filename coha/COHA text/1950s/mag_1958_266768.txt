Irish Ron Delany is an old-fashioned guy . He wears his black hair in a classic bartender 's bob , and he figures that a foot race has only one purpose : to find out whether one man can run faster than another . The problem is not so simple as it seems . When the big winter track meets bring some of the best milers in the world to the tight-banked boards of Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden , it is quite a trick just to find running room . Spikes slice close to bare shanks in the opening sprint for the pole ; elbows have a habit of splaying wide when the pack gangs up on a turn . And when the pack contains men like Hungary 's crack Istvan Rozsavolgyi , holder of three world records for outdoor middle-distance running , the problem is even more complicated . For while Ron runs to win and only as fast as he has to , Rozsy runs against the clock . He knows from wind-broken experience that setting a new record for the indoor mile may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing against Rozsy worried Ron , the pale , frail-looking Irishman in Villanova 's colors gave no sign last week when he glided easily into the early laps of the National Amateur Athletic Union mile . He picked a place in the clear , just off the pace , and let Chicago 's Phil Coleman tow the field along . His slow ( 2:05.2 ) half bothered him not a bit . Farther back , Rozsy began to show concern . He wasted energy jockeying for the lead . <P> Ron bounced along , his head bobbing , his spikes scratching splinters in his peculiar , pecking stride . Then , rounding into the final quarter , he threw his head up in surprise . Rozsy had sprinted past him , was kicking downhill into the short straightaway . Puzzled , Ron turned it on . It seemed a little early for the final sprint , but if that was the way it had to be-well , Ron knew what to do . He lengthened his own stride , won by twelve lengthening yards . <P> It all happened so fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clocked for the mile in 4:03.7 , just one-tenth second short of the indoor record . It was obvious that even if the Hungarian gets around to running up another record for himself , The Delany will probably be pounding home in front of that race too .
