Without the animosity that marked the anti-Americanism of a few weeks ago , British commentators probed what seemed to them a new direction in U.S. policy . In its bluntest terms , British opinion suspected that the old Anglo-U.S. alliance would not be quite the same again , and that for some time past it had not been quite what it seemed . <P> The most cited text for their new reading came from Vice President Nixon 's remarks , right after the U.S. voted against Britain and France in the U.N . General Assembly on the issue of Egypt : " For the first time in history , we have shown independence of Anglo-French policies toward Asia and Africa which seemed to us to reflect the colonial tradition . That declaration of independence has had an electrifying effect throughout the world . " Britons saw the idea confirmed last week as India 's Premier Jawaharlal Nehru emerged from intimate conference with President Eisenhower wreathed in smiles and declaring that U.S. policy is " not as rigid as I thought . " <P> After Suez . Not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Britain and France are currently so discredited that only the U.S. can save positions essential to all of them ( a quite different thesis from the angry Tory backbench contention that U.S. interests are trying to drive the British out of the Middle East ) . They understood that the alliance stands as firm as ever in the geographical limits of its primary purpose-the defense of Europe-and that Britain remains the U.S. 's closest friend by blood , interests and sentiment . This fact was underlined last week when the U.S.Export-Import Bank granted Britain a $500 million loan ( at 4% interest ) to help Britain through its post-Suez crisis . <P> But Suez dramatized what had long been an unadmitted fact : that the Anglo-American alliance is not , as it was often assumed to be , something that reflects a common policy around the world . No joint policy existed for the Middle East . No joint policy exists in the Far East , where the two powers disagree over the recognition of Red China . The U.S. , in helping emergent peoples in Asia and North Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association with the colonial powers . This stigma might not have been crippling if the U.S. , Britain and France had hammered out a joint approach that the Asian-African world could accept . They had not .
