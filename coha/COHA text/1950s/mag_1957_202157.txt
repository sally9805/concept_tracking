A Face in the Crowd ( Newtown ; Warner ) is the sort of cure that almost makes the disease desirable , even when the disease is as painful as the commercial phoniness that currently afflicts some parts of U.S. culture . The doctor in this case is Elia Kazan , a well-known specialist in social disorders who made On the Waterfront and Baby Doll and has directed three of Tennessee Williams ' plays . Unhappily Kazan does not seem to know the first thing about a satiric operation . As Lady Mary Wortley Montagu explained the technique : " Satire should , like a polished razor keen/ Thine is an oyster knife , that hacks and hews ; / The rage , but not the talent , to abuse . " <P> Rage is Kazan 's undoing . He hacks and hews with such ill-considered fury that the patient soon becomes a mere victim and the satire falls to pieces . The victim ( Andy Griffith ) is a big-time TV entertainer , a professional yokel . Behind his hawg-trough grin stands a greedy and brutal hog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the microphone manner . " Shucks , ' ' stutters Lonesome Rhodes , as he strim-strams on his li'l ole git-tar , " Ah 'm jes ' a country boy . " And soon his public stretches as far as his I can see . <P> Following the Budd Schulberg story on which the film is based , Kazan follows the great man from a jailhouse to a penthouse , and the trip is sometimes fun . Kazan takes time to inspect such scenic wonders of TV as the reason-why-sell , the inverse commercial , the collective think , the built-in crowd . He also provides some hilarious examples of TV shoptalk ( " Great show . J.B. " " Ye-e-es , I think it had size " ) . And all the while he is sinking the oyster knife into his victim , who loves nothing in the world so much as power-above all the power to make people crawl . <P> So far , soso . The film has moved too slowly , and Andy Griffith in his first movie role has been uneven and never quite convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is like to be in love with a hokum Yokum . And then the villain hits the top . He goes hog-wild , and so does Director Kazan . Instead of keeping the menace down to life size , the script permits its corn-fed psychopath to sphacelate through the U.S. social body like some malignant growth , until he actually threatens to take over the Federal Government . As the driving force of a fascist-tinged political movement . Lonesome Rhodes is promised a Cabinet post as Secretary for National Morale . But by this time the moviegoer is not believing a word of it , and he may well be wondering if Director Kazan , like the villain of his piece , has not somehow mistaken his public for a bunch of " stupid slobs. "
