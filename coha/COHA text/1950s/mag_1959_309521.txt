In a publisher 's warehouse in Milan last fall , Kalamazoo-born Conductor Thomas Schippers discovered an opera score dedicated to Queen Margherita * of Italy and tied up in purple string . In Spoleto last week , at the opening of Gian Carlo Menotti 's Festival of Two Worlds , he unwrapped his find before a capacity audience . Italian critics promptly hailed the long-forgotten work as one of the finest creations of Composer Gaetano Donizetti . <P> Work on Donizetti 's last opera , Il Duca d'Alba , was interrupted by the composer 's insanity , and the score remained unfinished at his death in 1848 . Completed by Journeyman Composer Matteo Salvi , it had its premiere in Rome in 1882 , was rarely heard after that . Conductor Schippers , of the Metropolitan Opera , spent eight months unscrambling the " blurred , impossible handwriting " of the original score , shaved away Salvi additions , reconstructed most of the originally proposed ending from Donizetti 's own figured bass and some solo sketches . What he arrived at was , said Schippers , " pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improbable libretto has to do with the efforts of the heroine , Amelia Egmont , to kill the Duke of Alba , 16th century Spanish governor of the conquered Low Countries . She succeeds only in killing her lover Marcello , who turns out to be Alba 's long-lost son . In a preposterous ending , the duke leaves Marcello 's body lying on the dock and sails for home to a cheerful mariners ' chorus . <P> The chief wonder of Alba was that Donizetti 's music again surmounted the absurdities of plot . In last week 's production the orchestra sailed in whirlwind rushes through Donizetti 's lush score ; as whispered duets and trios alternated with bellowed choruses , the opera built to its lyrical climax in Act II with a love duet for Amelia and Marcello . Critics found the duet as fine as anything in Lucia di Lammermoor , proclaimed Alba " worthy of Donizetti 's genius . " But they reserved their warmest praise for 29-year-old Conductor Schippers , who had triumphed , one wrote , " with all the faith and enthusiasm of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savoy ( 1851-1926 ) , strongwilled , mandolin-playing wife of Umberto I , mother of Victor Emmanuel III ( 1900-46 ) .
