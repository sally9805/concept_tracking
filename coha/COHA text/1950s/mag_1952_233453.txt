Flashed o'er the " wires the fateful message came , <P> He is no better ; he is much the same . <P> Thus in 1871 did Poet Alfred Austin report for the British people the illness of their Prince of Wales , later Edward VII . The Kingdom of Jordan boasts no such newsy poet as Britain 's Laureate Austin , but last week Jordan 's King Talal took to the wires to make his own attempt to chronicle the state of his health . In Beirut , Talal 's younger brother Naif received three telegrams . The first read : " Expect you in our legation in Rome as soon as possible . Talal . " The second read : " Meet at once at the Beau-Rivage Hotel , Lausanne . Talal . " The third read : " Forget my telegrams , no need to come .
