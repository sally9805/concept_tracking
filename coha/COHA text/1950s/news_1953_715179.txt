That decision was reacher by the new G.O.P. cabinet at luncheon yesterday in the South Room or the Commodore Hotel , and the President-elect asked his Secretary of State . John Foster Dulles , and his Mutual Security Administrator , Harold E Stassen , to undertake the talks . They 'll leave for Europe around the end of this month and expect to spend about 10 days there . An official announcement said Mf . Eisenhower asked Messrs . Dulles and Stassen " to get information on political trends there in relation to U. S. participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and in economic assistance programs ' Mr. Dulles said later that he wants to " get the feel of the situation in Europe " He explained he has been concentrating on Far Eastern problems and feels the European " atmosphere " will he important in " meeting problems that will be coming up over here. ?

Overseas , the NATO leaders . meeting in Paris last month , seemed ready to slow down their military build-up . Since then . the West German government has announced it wo n't join in arrangements for N.A T.0 ' s European Army on present terms , and a new French Premier has indicated that he plans to reduce France 's military outlays and also resist the inclusion of German forces unless some new conditions are met Britain 's Prime Minister Winston Churchill , who visited with Ike here last week , and French Premier Mayer , have also indicated that they 'll be looking to the U. S. for more help . Thus , the whole basis of the military and economic aid programs is up in the air .

The United Kingdom will also need economic assistance to carry forward her extended defense effort in thee face of a severe drain on her dollar reserves . Some economic aid will be needed by other European nations to enable them to fill critical gaps in the N.A.T.O . defenses " The unfavorable French and German developments cams after Mr. Truman 's message was written , and Britain 's foreign trade deficit has also taken a turn for the worse since then . These trends tend to increase the pressure for U.

Ezra Taft Benson , obviously about some re-shuffling in his department During the morning department heads finished going over Ike 's Inaugural Address and had a look at an early draft of his State of the Union Message .
