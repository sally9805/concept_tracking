txt The undisputed " dean " of all medical fakers is Dr. William Frederick Koch of Detroit , whose notorious apple juice , enema , and " glyoxylide " treatment for everything from tularemia to barber 's itch  --  but more especially for cancer  --  has gained a nation-wide following . Government prosecutors have branded Koch as " probably the smartest , brightest quack in the U. S. " Besides human ailments , Koch 's " glyoxylide " is also recommended for sterility and nervous disorders in cows . At one of Koch 's trials witnesses even testified that the glyoxylide would restore the cauliflowered ears of prize fighters to normal size and appearance . He 's Away : 3,000 Carry On : Koch is currently in Brazil snaring cobras and communing with the " Divine Presence , " according to letters to his friends , but his apple juice hokum is still being carried on at the Koch Cancer Clinic in Detroit and by about 3,000 Koch " doctors " thruout the country , including Dr. George Franklin Smith and Dr. Samuel Sprecher in Chicago . Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told a reporter he could cure her " for $325 if it 's cancer ; half price if it 's anything else . " Records in the state department of registration and education reveal that Smith offers a $50 commission per patient to physiotherapists and ministers who procure patients for him . Smith has claimed to cure coronary thrombosis , rheumatic fever , hives , syphilis , diabete s , tuberculosis , and cancer with one shot of gly-1 oxylide . It also dissolves cataracts on the eyes , he says . Still Quacks at Old Spot During Tan TRIBUNE 'S current drive against Chicago 's quacks , a reporter found Smith still quacking at the same old stand , 220 S. State st . She telephoned him to ask for a Koch doctor on the south side who could treat her " mother 's " stomach cancer . " My dear , " said Dr. Smith in his best bedside voice , " there is only one doctor in Chicago who knows how to use the Koch therapy , and that is Dr. Smith . Dr. George Franklin Smith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town calls , he said , but he would buzz right down to give the $325 injection to the reporter 's " mother . " On second thought , the reporter told him , she might better take her " mother " direct to the Koch Cancer Clinic in Detroit . Reporter Sends " Sister " Since the same rep " rter could n't return to Smith a second time for examination , she sent an assistant , posing as her " sister , " to see if he would offer to . cure her " diabetes . " He did . He made no tests or examinations to confirm her story tha t she had diabetes ? which she did n't  --  but merelytook her word for it and promised her a cure with his Koch glyoxylide injection . The price , he said , would be $325 if the diabetes was caused by an allergy , and " only half price if it 's simple diabetes . " When the " patient " told him her second cousin had asthma , Smith then deduced , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type . He told her his glyoxylide would prevent " protein poisoning " the cause of many diabetic deaths , he explained and that she could stop taking insulin . Pledges Patient to Secrecy " After all , " he said , ' " do you know how much the insulin manufacturers make ? A cold million dollars every day . " He implored the " patient " not to " spread it around " that he was treating diabetes with the Koch therapy . At one of Koch 's trials , where Smith testified for Koch , a government prosecutor called Smith " the rankest sort of impostor ? I would n't have him treat my dog . " His hearing on a revocation of his Illinois medical license is now pending . Chicago 's other Koch doctor , Sam Sprecher , a member of the Chicago Medical society and now under investigation , did not try to force the Koch treatment on the reporter . He first gave her a prescription for liniment and three kinds of pills for what he diagnosed as " probably arthritis , " then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the Koch injection for only $60 ? payable in advance . He confessed sadly that his own cut on the Koch treatment was only $10 . The other $50 goes to the " Christian Medical Research league " in Detroit , distributors of the distilled water " cancer cure . " Visits Clinic in Detroit In Detroit , THE TRIBUNE reporter paid a personal visit to the famous Koch Cancer clinic on E. Jefferson blvd . The huge , old brownstone building was literally swarming with patients . After half an hour of waiting she was beckoned by an ancient looking nurse , a Miss Nottingham , who asked where the new " patient " was ailing . " My lungs , " she said . " 0 , tuberculosis ! " she chirped eagerly . " My , we do have such marvelous results with tuberculosis . " " Well , I 'm not sure , " said the reporter . " One doctor says it 's TB , but on my last X-rays they found what they think is a tumor . " " A tumor ? 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightly . She made an appointment for the reporter to return in three days to see the doctor . " Meanwhile , " she said , " we 'll get you prepared for treatment . You take two enemas a day and drink nothing but apple juice and distilled water . No city water . " Stresses Apple Juice Diet She gave the reporter the familiar Koch pamphlet , " Instructions for Patients , " to add to her growing collection . The instructions prohibit the use of aluminum cooking utensils , cosmetics , hair tonics , witch hazel , aspirins , rubbing alcohol , and city water even tho boiled . The booklet deals principally with the importance of daily enemas and the apple juice diet ? the " detoxification " routine . Doctor Brags of " Luck " Dr. H. E. Wisner , now head of the Koch Clinic , then entered and became engrossed with the patient 's TB symptoms . " We have wonderful luck with TB . cancer , and diabetes , " he declared . The reporter told him she did n't have TB at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an impulse , told him she came in to inquire whether the Koch treatment might be beneficial to her husband , a diabetic . Dr. Wisner definitely preferred TB or cancer . He would not go so far as Dr. Smith and say that the diabetic could stop taking insulin . " My colleagues in the A. M. A. do n't approve of our methods , " said Dr. Wisner . " O , are you a member of the A. M. A. ? " A check with the Wayne County Medical society disclosed that Wisner is a member and therefore automatically a member of the American Medical association . A spokesman for the society , which . ousted Koch for his cancer quackery , said Wisner 's activities are under investigation . Admits Using Machines " Yes , I 'm a member , " he said proudly . " I used the Koch treatment in private practice long before I became head of the clinic . And my colleagues in the A. M. A. do n't know it , but I also used some of these electronic diagnostic machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out if they knew , " he said . " What a shame . Do you also use that new sugar medicine for diabetes that I 've been reading about ? " His manner froze abruptly . " What medicine ? " he asked . " The Kaadt medicine , I read about it in the Eleventh Hour . " " What 's the Eleventh Hour ? " he asked stonily . " Why , doctor . Do n't you know the Eleventh Hour ? It 's that magazine that 's always printing articles about how wonderful the Koch treatment is , and now they 're writing about the Kaadt medicine for diabetes . It 's a magazine put out by some Lutheran company . " " I 'm Baptist , " He Snaps " I 'm not a Lutheran , I 'm a Baptist , " Wisner snapped . " I never heard of the Eleventh Hour . " The " Eleventh Hour " is a socalled " church " magazine published by Lawrence Reilly , who calls himself " The Reverend " and heads the " Lutheran Research Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutheran bodies in America . Reilly , under the cloak of " religion , " divides his time and energies between publicizing both the Koch cancer cure and the infamous Kaadt vinegar and saltpeter " cure " for diabetes for which the Kaadt brothers were convicted in Indiana in 1948 . Reilly personally escorts patients to the Koch Cancer Clinic , and for years admittedly has been Koch 's best booster . Yet , the present director of the clinic pretended complete ignorance about the " church " organization . Wisner told the reporter it would cost her $25 for an examination and $150 a shot for the Koch injections  --  for cancer , TB , or whatever ailed her . She said she would think it over . Ex-Colleague Now Competitor Her next visit was to the office of Dr. George W. Palm in Detroit , Wisner 's predecessor as head of the Koch Clinic . Here the reporter ' ' learned of the most intriguing development within Koch circles . The doctors themselves , it seems , ca n't agree , and according to Palm and his right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being pushed around by a bunch of ministers who were only after the money " referring to Reilly 's crew , and so they parted company from the Koch Cancer Clinic and its glyoxylide distributor , the " Christian Medical Research league , " and are now manufactur-1 ing their own sooge nautical term for caustic paint removing mixture in Midland , Mich. , in competition with Koch ! Of course , Palm explained ; it will have a new name , and the technique will be slightly different . Only one enema a day , instead of two . A diet of apple juice , distilled water , and pumpernickel bread , and then the injection . Palm showed the reporter the small ampule of glyoxylide , which in Palm 's outfit will be known as " biocronone , " and explained that it must never be opened when there is an odor of , turpentine or paint in the room . Ca n't Tell It from Water The controversial glyoxylide or distilled water ampules have been tested by scores of government and independent chemists , and in well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The substance has been found to have no curative value and to be " indistinguishable from distilled water . " When questioned about this , Dr. Palm told the reporter : " Of course chemists ca n't find anything but distilled water . The catalyst can be detected only by radioactivity . " Tests have failed to find any radioactive materials in the ampules . Palm also told the reporter he got fed up with " doing all the work and only getting half the profits " at the Koch Clinic . The A. M. A. 's investigation bureau has reported Palm to his local medical society in northern Michigan for investigation . Attends " Research " Meetings During THE TRIBUNE 'S quack investigation , the reporter also attended two Koch meetings of the " Christian Medical Research League " in the Sherman hotel . " Dr. " Sam Swain , president of the " League " and an itinerant evangelist and bookstore owner of Akron , 0 . not a member of the Akron Ministerial Association , presided . The uninvited guest recognized several of her Koch acquaintances , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sunny , beaming , and self assured smile , and Dr. Sam Sprecher . It was an unexpected pleasure , however , to sneak a look at the man who stumbled across her feet in finding a chair and see none other than the character from 1869 N. Damen as. , . Dr. Peter B. Busy Beaver Schyman . She had just bought a gallon jug for $30 of Scliyman 's vinegar and saltpeter Kaadt " cure " for diabetes , but had n't known of his interest in glyoxylide . Fortunately , Dr. Schyman is near sighted and did not recognize his former " patient . " He took a seat only two rows in front of the young , handsomely dressed " reverend " who spends his time praying for Quacks Kaadt and Koch ? " Eleventh Hour Editor Lawrence Reilly . They Call Cancer Beneficial : Among the phenomenal medical theories advanced at the Koch meeting were : A cancer growth is merely " nature 's way of protecting human life , " domestic rabbits are 82 per cent digestible and therefore preferable to all other meats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scar tissue from a cancerous stomach . Even to a layman , the ludicrous display of abysmal ignorance among the self-styled doctors was shocking . After several hours of this farce , THE TRMUNE reporter slipped downstairs to a house telephone , c a 1 le d the meeting room , and asked for Lawrence Reilly . " May I have the name of your first speaker on the program ? " she asked . He told her it was Stanley G. Bandeen , who , records revealed , is an osteopath from Louisville , Ky. , a former " teacher " of the preposterous buncombe known as " Abrams electronics " upon which the fake Drown machine is based . The reporter then identified herself to Reilly , told him she enjoyed the meeting , and asked him to lunch . When . " The Reverend " finally collected himself , he asked , " When were you at our meeting ? " " 0 , I 've been there all morning , " she cheerfully replied , and again asked him to lunch . Reilly stalled , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant Miss Browning an interview . " This is really very sudden , " he said in a grave , somber tone . " I am going to need time to think it over . I will have to pray for Divine Guidance before deciding whether I want to talk to you . " Altho the reporter assured him she was harmless , and only wanted the truth about the Koch and Kaadt " cures " from the lips of a good Christian , Reilly insisted on praying first . He volunteered to start praying right away , and apparently still is.
