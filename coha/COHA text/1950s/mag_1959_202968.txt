The woods along Oregon 's presidential primary trail are full of eager political explorers , but of all of them , none is so determined as Massachusetts ' Democratic Senator John Kennedy . Last week Jack Kennedy 's wagon train was pounding hell for leather up the trail toward primary day next May , leaving the others well fogged in the dust . <P> Of no great moment was the announcement by Oregon 's Senator Wayne Morse that , despite the pleas of " thousands , " he would not permit his name to be put on the primary ballot as a favorite son . More to the point was the fact that both Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stevenson lost some of their best scouts . One was a national committeeman and state senator , Monroe Sweetland , onetime socialist and longtime Democratic liberal , who declared that he was switching his support from Humphrey to Kennedy . On Sweetland 's heels was equally influential Sylvia Nemer , 1956 co-chairman of the Stevenson campaign , whose strength counts a lot with still uncommitted Congresswoman Edith Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stevenson easily , " explained Mrs. Nemer as she threw in with Kennedy . " But I finally realized we must avoid the pitfall of the father image that has befallen the Republicans . The first fact of life is that Stevenson does n't want to run and ca n't be forced into running . I am with the wing of the party that wants to stop Symington or Johnson . I regard both Humphrey and Kennedy as outstanding liberals , but I believe Kennedy is the man who can win . "
