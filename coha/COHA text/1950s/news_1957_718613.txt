txt The amount of milk kept away from metropolitan dealers rose yesterday to 10 per cent  --  about 950,000 quarts , or 250,000 more than on Monday . The third day of a farmers ' boycott saw increasing tension and violence in the dairy country upstate and in New Jersey and Pennsylvania . Health Commissioner Leona Baumgartner asserted , however , that the stoppage thus far " has had no effect on the fresh milk supply of New York City . " Some processors , she said , were filling their fresh milk needs by diverting milk normally used for cream , condensed milk and ice cream . Farmers brought guns and clubs into action , some seeking to deliver their milk , others trying to stop trucks . Last night three major dealers ' associations telegraphed the Governors of New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania demanding " immediate and adequate police protection from farm to city to prevent serious milk shortage in New York City , northern New Jersey , Long Island and Westchester . " The New York State Police canceled all leaves and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey assigned 200 state policemen , an increase of forty , to keep roads open in Warren , Sussex , Hunterdon and Morris Counties . The Rev. John W. Dorney , executive director of the TriState Master Dairy Farmers Guild , said the boycott would go on until a majority of dealers supplying the metropolitan area agree to raise the price paid to farmers to $5.75 a hundred pounds , about 12 cents a quart . This would compare with the present Federally administered price of $4.57 . Mr. Dorney , a Congregational minister , declared that these agreements would have to be made individually with his guild 's office in Branchville , N. J. Eighteen or twenty dealers in the three states have signified willingness to , do so , he said , but he declined to identify them . ? " The guild decided that , as of today , it will deliver milk to  --  all dealers who pay $5.75 a . hundredweight under contract until July 1 , " Mr. Dorney announced . " At that time the price will be renegotiated . Money received under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund for the duration of the strike . " Mr. Dorney was not successful last night in having the Dairy Farmers of America , which claims 2,000 members , join the boycott . There are 131 dealers operating 381 plants served by 44,576 farmers in the milkshed for the New York Metropolitan Milk Marketing Area , according to the Federal Administrator 's office . This comprises the city and Westchester , Nassau and Suffolk Counties . Reports to the office said 2,048,925 pounds of milk  --  equivalent to 952,730 quarts  --  had been withheld yesterday . This was 10 per cent of the daily supply of 20,000,000 pounds , and compared with 1,500,000 pounds kept away Monday . Forty-eight plants , thirteen more than Monday , were reported wholly or partly deprived of their supply  --  twenty-six in New York State , fourteen in New Jersey and eight in Pennsylvania . Co-op Keeps Plants Open me Dairymen 's League Cooperative Assocation , with 23 , - 000 farmer members , reiterated that its plants were staying open for any member choosing ' to deliver milk . The league said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand the marketing area to include northern New Jersey and more ' of upstate New York , with a Federal hearing set for next Tuesday at the Commodore Hotel . In Albany , Daniel J. Carey , State Commissioner of Agriculture , said he knew of no shortage of bottled milk thus far in the state . The boycott , he said , might actually increase the blended average price paid to farmers who are delivering milk , because more of the delivered supply would be used as higherpriced bottled milk . The Commissioner said he did not see " how the farmers could afford " to keep up the boycott very long . Based on  --  the Federal reports , calculations indicated each was losing $25 a day for an average 547 pounds withheld . The pleas for more state protection came from the Milk Dealers Association of Metropolitan New York , the Milk Handlers and Processors Association and the Milk Dealers Association of Northern New Jersey , meeting at the BarbizonPlaza Hotel . They charged farmers wanting to deliver milk were being I stopped by " a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence and property . " Threats , they said , were made against farmers ' wives , children , cattle and barns , and trucks were being " dumped , damaged and fired upon . " A spokesman asserted the New Jersey situation was " desperate . " Six men were charged with malicious mischief after a tank truck was fired on near Monroe , N. Y. , causing its milk to run out . A non-striking farmer fired a shot to get through a picket line at Boonville , and one man was arrested after a fist fight . A truck driver stopped for coffee at a diner in Boonville , and found on his return that a valve had been opened , spilling 12,000 quarts of milk into the street . , In Ellicottville , two pickets were bruised by a truck . In New Jersey , a non-striker reported dynamite was set off in front of his home at Wantage , in Sussex County . Dan Wettlin Jr. , executive vice president of the New Jersey Milk Industry Association , charged in Trenton that " the situation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lack of effective law enforcement .
