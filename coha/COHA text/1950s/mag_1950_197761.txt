In picking a winner , it usually helps to know a horse 's pedigree . In picking the winner of the Kentucky Derby , which is run before the three-year-olds have learned all that even good trainers can teach them , pedigree is a prime consideration . Most of the crowd at Churchill Downs last week paid more attention to past performances . <P> Taking their tips from spring form charts , the customers pretty much narrowed the Derby down to a race between the California speedster , Your Host ( 9-5 ) , and the Virginia-bred come-from-behinder , Hill Prince ( 2-1 ) . The obvious question was whether Your Host could keep up his blazing speed for the Derby distance of a mile-and-a-quarter . Third choice , after an impressive win in the Blue Grass Stakes ( TIME , May 8 ) , was the fast-improving Mr. Trouble ( 6-1 ) . <P> Always a Bridesmaid ? This tidy simplification of the 14-horse Derby field all but ignored a sleek chestnut colt named Middleground-even though , in Handicapper John Campbell 's experimental weights , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , Middleground had run a good second in each of his four races . As a formful bridesmaid who never quite got to be a bride , he was 8-1 as the horses cantered to the post . The bettors had forgotten , or were unimpressed by the fact that Middleground was sired by Bold Venture , winner of the 1936 Derby ; that another Bold Venture colt , Assault , had won the 1946 Derby ; and that the man who trained both of them , and Middleground too , was canny Max Hirsch of Bob Kleberg 's King Ranch . <P> When the horses broke from the Derby gate , Your Host rushed into the lead as expected . If he was not to be allowed to steal the race , somebody had to push him . Mr. Trouble 's jockey , Doug Dodson , elected to do the job , and did it so successfully that Your Host stopped all over after a sizzling mile , ended up ninth . Hill Prince , with Eddie Arcaro riding for his fifth Derby victory , + hung in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bid , finished second . Mr. Trouble , used up too soon , held on well to take third money . <P> It was not until the stretch that the 90,000 people in Churchill Downs paid much attention to Middleground. * Eighteen-year-old Jockey Bill Boland , an apprentice riding in his first Derby , had been given explicit instructions by Trainer Hirsch : " Do n't pay any attention to Your Host at all . He ca n't go the distance.Ride against Hill Prince and those other horses . " <P> Loose In the Stretch . Jockey Boland did exactly that . He kept Middleground well up all the way , turned him loose at the quarter pole . Hill Prince almost came even with him for a few yards , but Jockey Boland had more horse under him than Jockey Arcaro had that afternoon . Middleground won by a length-and-a-quarter . His time : 2:01 3/5 , the second fastest in the Derby 's 76-year history ( fastest : Whirlaway 's 2:01 2/5 in 1941 ) . <P> Your Host , which set the pace for most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to have won most Derbies , had lived up to their spring performances . Middleground had lived up to his pedigree . <P> <P> + Arcaro also went by the form charts . He had his choice between Hill Prince and Middleground as a Derby mount , made his decision after riding Hill Prince to victory over Middleground in the Wood Memorial ( TIME , May 1 ) .
