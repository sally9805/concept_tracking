Like many other architects who came out of college during the Depression , Thomas Fransioli had to live more by chance than by design . Commissions were scarce , so he tried other ventures-farming , hog butchering and painting . By 1939 he was designing exhibition rooms for Washington 's new National Gallery and painting miniature Goyas and Rembrandts for his small-scale models of the rooms . During World War II , the wreckage of cities and men 's lives filled Fransioli with a desire to create a neat and orderly world in painting . <P> Last week visitors to the Farnsworth Art Museum at Rockland , Me. saw a sweeping vista of this tidy world . It had the pure newness of renderings on an architect 's drawing board . Among the 53 Fransioli works were paintings of New England houses as scrupulous as portraiture . There were cityscapes of Boston and Cambridge in which the red bricks of Beacon Hill and Harvard glow with warmth , the Charles is mirrorlike and the winter sun , casting long shadows , is bright on the bare trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiseptic foyer of a brand-new medical building . Fransioli 's neatness and light reminded proper Bostonians of their childhood , and Down East ladies cooed over familiar Maine scenes while they fingered Artist Fransioli 's trompe-l'oeil detail . <P> In his eight years as a painter , Fransioli has done 76 pictures , sold 64 ( current prices : $400 to $1,200 ) . At 49 , he is still looking for change . His two latest canvases-a corner of his bedroom as he sees it when he wakes up in the morning , and a black cat vaguely reflected in a window-have moody overtones suggesting that Fransioli may be tending toward introspection . But while he experiments , he will still save his needle-sharp No. 1 brushes for sure-selling landscape commissions and the sunlight-and-shadow world he paints so precisely .
