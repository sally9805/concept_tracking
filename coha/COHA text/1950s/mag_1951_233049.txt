One of Manhattan 's best addresses has long been 720 Fifth Avenue . There , for 40 years , Duveen Bros. , dealers in old masters , have peddled Rembrandts , Raphaels and Gainsboroughs to Mellons , Morgans and Rockefellers . Last week Duveen 's had moved into new and smaller quarters on a residential side street . The reason : " The old location was getting a bit too commercial . " <P> Duveen 's new headquarters shows other signs of the times . Now the firm 's $10 million collection , heretofore seen only by customers with a million-dollar gleam in their eyes , will be on rotating display downstairs , where anyone with bus fare can come in and look it over . Customers who mean business will still be shown upstairs to velvet-hung rooms where they can look more meaningly . <P> Hearty Joseph Duveen , who died ( in 1939 ) Lord Duveen of Millbank , bullied and cajoled two generations of U.S. multimillionaires into amassing some of the greatest private art collections in history . Today the firm is headed by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Bertram Boggis . The old " super-customers , " as Vice President Boggis calls them , have disappeared . In their place are some " very good customers . " Who they are , Fowles and Boggis prefer not to say . " Nobody would deal with you if you were so indiscreet as to tell . " <P> Duveen 's sees one big problem ahead : the scarcity of old masters . " You ca n't keep draining Europe forever , " says President Fowles . " Finally you get to the bottom of the barrel . " But Duveen 's barrel is still well padded . For sale last week : five Rembrandts , four Botticellis , six Bellinis , three Titians , three Gainsboroughs , two Giorgiones , one Fra Angelico , one Castagno and 600 other lesser English , Dutch , French and Italian old lights .
