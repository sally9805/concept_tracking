When reveille sounds at any of the four major U.S. Air Force bases in Newfoundland these dark winter mornings , the G.I. hits the deck of a barracks built of local materials by local labor . He breakfasts on food bought in Newfoundland , and turns to on a work detail with tools and equipment supplied by local merchants . Taking a break , he eats a candy bar or sips a Coke which the PX has bought in the province . After hours , he catches a local bus , takes his local girl to a local movie , and buys her coffee and doughnuts or beer at a local snackbar or tavern . Housing , feeding and entertaining American G.I.s has become Newfoundland 's fourth largest industry-after fisheries , forestry and mining-with an annual income well over $10 million . <P> Employment of Newfoundlanders at U.S. bases totals 3,500 . They are being paid at the rate of $9,000,000 a year , which equals the payroll of the entire mining industry in the province . The U.S. will make some $2,500,000 worth of local purchases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies . Such incidentals as a $100,000 charter fee for a motor vessel to transport island supplies , almost $87,000 rental paid by off-base servicemen and $16,000 tuition to local schools attended by children of military personnel , help to give the economy a powerful shot in the arm . <P> Last week the U.S.A.F. 's Northeast Air Command opened a procurement office in St. John 's Water Street . It had a list of Newfoundland firms ready to provide anything from Alka Seltzer to zwieback . In its first week the new office placed $17,340 worth of orders and signed a contract for a month 's ration of bread . Newfoundland merchants beamed . The Yanks were bringing boom times , and the end was nowhere in sight .
