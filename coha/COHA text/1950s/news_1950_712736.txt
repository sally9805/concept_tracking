txt The ABCs of American foreign policy have been put squarely on the record . . This primer of American foreign policy , the work of Secretary , of State Dean Acheson , is the administration 's answer to those who are urging some quick and dramatic move to end the - Cold war . lt is an appeal to all Americans to accept the fact that there rs no easy way out of the crisis period in which they live . But , above all . it is a cracker-barrel explanation of just what the world 's troubles are all about and how the administration thinks they can be solved . Originally this elementary lesson in foreign policy was an off-the-cuff , off-the-record talk by the secretary to a group of private citizens at the White House Feb. 16 . They found it  --  so valuable and so persuasive , however , and word of it traveled so fast on the Washington grapevine , that a record of his words now has been made public . Essence of Talk In essence Mr. Acheson said this : The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial " a struggle for what they believe in as when they mobilized all their resources and strength to defeat naziism . However , as this is not a " hot " war , many people find it hard to believe that our present adversary is just as deadly serious . just as set on world domination and the destruction of those human rights and freedoms we hold most dear , as was Hitlerism . Actually , all former imperial-isms are . " kid stuff " in comparison to the totalitarian brand the Kremlin . has developed , whose weapons are force , threats , infiltration , planned chaos , despair , confusion , enslavement . For many persons who believe that Communists underneath must be just like other people , it is difficult , if not next to impossible , to believe they would destroy human freedom . And so , these persons cry out for a meeting of " Harry " and " . Joe , " sure that if only President Truman and Prime Minister Joseph V. Stalin " could get their feet under the same table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , has taught those who have had the negotiating with the Soviets to do that the only thing the Kremlin respects is power and the only agreements it obserites are those built on strength . Of the three courses open to the United States in dealing with the Soviets , one is out of the question , another is quite premature , leaving only the third , or arduous . task of creating areas of strength throughout the world , as possible . U.S. Position It is impossible for the United States , a democracy , to stage a showdown , or preventive war against the Soviet Union  --  and the Kremlin knows it . No good will come from the West urging Stalin to sit down with Mr. Truman and settle their differences ( and much harm might be done through raising false hopes in some and fears among others ) , for when the Kremlin in its own good time is ready to settle a question with the West it wo n't hesitate to let the West . know . The Berlin blockade is an illustration . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West was not going to be driven from Berlin did it give the sign it wanted a settlement . Stalin can pull out of a drawer a questionnaire from a correspondent ( as he did in the Berlin case ) whenever he is ready to talk
