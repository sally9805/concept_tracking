The little white frame Congregational church at Staffordville , Conn. ( pop . 1,000 ) is the only Protestant church in town . Most of its 75 members-Italians , Poles , Czechs and some Yankees-work in the nearby button and belt factories . <P> This week almost all of them , including the postmaster and factory officials , turned out to hear their new pastor preach his first sermon . The Rev. Roland T. Heacock , 56 , Connecticut-born graduate of Yale Divinity School ( ' 24 ) and World War II Army chaplain , was looking forward enthusiastically to his new post . " The whole country is interested in better race relations , " he said . " We have a wonderful opportunity here to be a laboratory . " Dr. Heacock was deeply aware , of course , that there are not many other churches like Staffordville 's , with a white congregation and a Negro minister .
