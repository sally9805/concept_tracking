txt ADMIRAL SEES U. S. AS MISSILE VICTOR Says Satellite Has Injured Soviet I.C.B.M. Program RN- RICHARD WITIiII One of the Defense Department 's leading missile experts ! said last night he was certain that the Soviet Unions success with its earth satellite had weakened its intercontinental ballistic missile program . Vice Admiral John H. Sides , director of the Pentagon 's Weapons System Evaluation Group , expressed the view that winning the race for long-range missiles was more important than firing the first satellite . " I am confident that we shall win that race , " he added . The admiral suggested that the intercontinental ballistic missile ( I. C. B. M. ) the Russians report having launched successfully might well have been a satellite gone astray . The Soviet announcement was made in August . He also expressed confidence that the Russians had not outdistanced the United States " in any important manner , except that they are doing well in psychological warfare . " And he ridiculed the recent suggesnon of Nikita S. Khrushchev , Soviet Communist party leader , that missiles had outmoded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armada might as well be discarded . Admiral Sides spoke at a , // and what must be done to improve it . " We call upon the President to utilize the funds appropriated for missile development and scientific research and to establish clear lines of responsibility in this operation . " We call upon the President to be a leader . " Passage came after Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri read the group a telegram he had sent the President earlier today . He demanded that the United States missile program be stepped up to six days a week immediately in an effort to shorten any present Russian advantage . ' Rigid Restrictions ' Noted " The design and structure of the satellite is clear evidence the Communists are now ahead of us in the long-range missile race , " the Senator declared . " Unless , therefore , the United States increases its efforts in the missile field , this Soviet superiority under their policy of all-out efforts can only grow into supremacy . " Despite this , he asserted , two weeks have passed with no move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still being held to a five-day week , " he said , " with rigid restrictions on overtime . He asked how the Administration could threaten to attack " the great military of the world " while holding back its own defense program . He referred to the warning this week by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that the United States would not let the Soviet Union attack Turkey from " a privileged sanctuary . " Another conference resolution deplored the President 's " failure to use the full prestige of his office to support the decision of the Supreme Court in the many weeks prior to the crisis , , at Little Rock . " It assailed Gov . Orval E. Faubus of Arkansas for using the National Guard " to interfere with execution " of a Federal Court order to end racial segregation at Little Rock Central High School . The conference pledged to work for " a day when every citizen will enjoy fully his American rights without discrimination . " Larger Stockpiles ' Urged The conference , a political organization embracing the Midwestern farm belt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities be permitted by law " and that such carry-over be removed from consideration when establishing prices in the market The resolution declared : " The Republican party is dominated by leaders who do not recognize the importance of farm production and farm income in our national economy . nor the contribution that adequate food production can make to the maintenance of the friendship of other peoples of the world * * * . " Twenty million people in America are now on substandard diets . Vast areas of the world are suffering from an acute shortage of the basic foods . We recommend the use of every available means of utilizing our God-given abundance to answer this great need . " Alluding to an earlier phrase by Mr. Dulles , " brink of war , " Mr. Truman told the Democrats : " The brink is right here , not in the office Of the Secretary of State . If you do n't remedy it with political action , the brink will get you if you do n't watch out . " We used to be the leaders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ever had because we had to have an ' agonizing reappraisal . ' We 've got the agony , all right , but we have n't got the reappraisal . "
