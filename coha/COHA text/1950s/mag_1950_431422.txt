THE POSTAGE will be $86,000 , " said the Chinese girl clerk at the post office in Taipei , capital of Formosa , as she handed me stamps for sending an air-mail letter . " I do n't want to air-mail this letter to the moon , " I started to explain . " Just to England . " Then I realized calculations were in order . These postage stamps cost 86,000 old Formosan dollars . Last spring the inflated currency had been stabilized at 40,000 old dollars to one new Formosan dollar , or yuan . Many old bills were still in circulation ? worth little more than the paper they were printed on . Let 's see . . . 40,000 into $86,000 gives $2.15 in new Formosan currency . At the official rate of exchange the new Formosan dollar was worth 20 cents in United States money . So the stamps really cost 43 cents . I paid and was motioned toward a public paste pot . " I see why they do n't put stickum on the stamps here , " said my colleague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd all stick together . " Island Eden Bristles with Troops Five and a half hours out of Tokyo , 1,275 miles away , our big four-engined Douglas plane of China National Aviation Corporation had roared over the north coastline of Ilha Formosa , " Beautiful Island , " as early Portuguese explorers called it . Chinese and Japanese call it Taiwan , translated literally " Bay of Terraces . " From the air Formosa had looked as peaceful as paradise . Opalescent waters edged her shores and broke on her beaches in ivory foam . Water-covered rice fields flashed their facets in the sun . Silvery rivers coiled to the sea , and southward to the limit of vision stretched high mountains wrapped in green , their haughty heads cloud-covered . This illusion of peace had vanished as soon as we landed at Taipei . At a military field alongside lay camouflage-painted Americanbuilt planes of the Chinese ( Nationalist ) Air Force . And almost immediately we had made the acquaintance of Chinese police , bent on keeping Communist spies from this uneasy island . From the embattled mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees , including Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and many high officials . In addition , the island bristled with thousands of tan-clad Nationalist soldiers ( pages 140 , 151 , 173 ) . Rivals Australia in Population An official civilian population figure of 7,026,883 , based on a checkup made in April , 1949 , was already far out of date in August as more mainlanders kept pouring in . Troops , their exact number a military secret , raised the total almost to the population level of the continent-country of Australia , more than 200 times Formosa 's size . The island reminded me of a heavily loaded lifeboat . After half a century of Japanese rule , from 1895 to 1945 , Formosa had been returned to the Chinese pending a peace treaty with Japan . All the Japanese ? some 478,000 ? had been deported . The Nationalist Chinese , taking over in accordance with the wartime Cairo agreement  | between Allied Chiefs of State , were greeted at first as liberators and brothers by the 6,000,000 Taiwanese , descendants of emigrant from southern China generations before . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flared int . ' the Formosan revolt of February and March 1947 , in which thousands were killed . From the Japanese the Government had inherited the problem of Formosa 's aborigines some of whom were hunting heads till shorty before the war . These former head-hunter live chiefly in the mountains of the interior The Government now estimates their number at 131,261 . At the Taiwan Tourist Company an employee pointed to the interior on a map and said to us with a grimace , " The barbarians live in this part . " When we sought permission to visit the aborigines , the chief of the foreign section of the police looked grave . " We shall have to send a policeman with you , " he said through an interpreter . " For your protection , of course . " Meanwhile , the police required a detailed itinerary , both for the trip into the interior and for our proposed circuit of the island . Though Nationalist China was fighting for its life against the Communists on the main- land , Government offices here were closing at 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request went slowly from desk to desk for approval by various officials , we had plenty of time to look around Taipei . Taipei Travels Largely by Muscle Most of the swollen city 's 439,793 people seemed to be riding bicycles , rickshas , or bicycle buggies called pedicabs . Jeeps and sleek American cars carried a minority . Wealthy Chinese , chiefly Government officials , had brought Cadillacs , Mercuries , Buicks , Chryslers from Shanghai and other mainland ports . Chic nylon-stockinged Chinese girls with permanent waves and high-necked , tightfitting , slit-skirt dresses rode bicycles or pedicabs to work in paper-piled Government offices . The city has a few buses but no streetcars . Except for pedicabs , which often darted about with little regard for the rules , traffic moved on the right-hand side . Chiang Kaishek in Formosa , unlike General MacArthur  | Kay , son of a Canadian missionary and a Chinese mother , described aboriginal ways .

" Movie Film Lines a Formosan Hat As soon as our police permit was ready , we headed by jeep for the Taiyal country beyond Kakubanzan , or Chiaopanshan as the Chinese call it , in the mountains on the upper Tanshui River southwest of Taipei ( map , page 144 ) . The tattoo-faced Taiyals have long been known as the most warlike of the island 's seven major tribal groups . With us went geologist Arnold C. Mason , of the U. S. Army Engineers , whose mapping work took him in the same direction ; an interpreter , Loa Heng Siong , from the Taipei Y.M.C.A. ; and our little Chinese policeman " protector , " who told us to call him Robert . Formosa 's morning sun was scorching , so Joe stopped to buy a " Panama " hat on Taipei 's arcaded main street . The hat -- price , 80 cents , U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but obviously its sweatband was n't . " Why , " exclaimed photographer Roberts , " it 's 35-millimeter movie film with the emulsion removed . What , no Technicolor ? " Just outside of Taipei , Formosan farmers were raking rice out into the concrete road . Mason , at the wheel , started to avoid it , then realized the grain was put here to be threshed by the wheels of traffic ( page 148 ) . It was August 10 , and in the rice fields farmers were weeding the second crop of the season . Unlike Japanese , who bend from the waist , Formosan farmers get down on their knees in several inches of mud and water and go down the green rows like a charwoman scrubbing a floor ( page 172 ) . Police Station in a Temple As we passed a Buddhist temple in Taoyuan , west of Taipei , we saw a policeman with fixed bayonet standing guard at the entrance . Robert successfully talked us inside , and we found that the temple was being used as a police station . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no other suitable place . " While off-duty policemen ate lunch in one corner , worshippers went through their rites before an elaborate assortment of images . At a near-by store big bamboo baskets were full of bundles of bills like stage money . This , explained our interpreter , was " money for ghost . " Chinese buy this false money and burn it at funerals for use by the departed . Friends had told us of the strange Formosan push cars , which are pushed by hand or even poled like a boat , and soon after leaving the main road we picked up their spoor ? small twin iron tracks 19 inches apart and so uneven that it seemed impossible for a car to stay on them long . These led toward the distant mountains , which were turning from purple to green as we approached . Far up the track an object appeared , a car about as big as my office desk and half as high . Under a parasol sat the passengers , a mother and her small daughter . The " engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwanese . When he saw us he grinned and fired what I imagine was his entire English vocabulary . It came out all in one breath : " OK-come-on-let's-go . " Now the road grew rougher and began to climb . Push cars on the wavering track alongside carried coal from a small mine near by . Formosa contains considerable coal , but deposits are chiefly in veins too thin for largescale production . Through Blackness to a Different World When the speedometer read 32 miles from Taipei , the rough road suddenly ended at a dark hole in a mountain spur . Into this muddy , rock-strewn tunnel the push-car tracks adventurously vanished . - As we munched the lunches we had brought and wondered what to do next , an old Chinese woman emerged from the dripping tunnel . her bare feet plastered with mud . To show her appreciation of the prawns we offered from our lunch boxes , she offered to go back through the tunnel and summon a push car . When the car appeared , its motive power proved to be a 15-year-old Taiwanese girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dame running guard . She pushed five men through the eighth-of-a-mile-long tunnel without even puffing . We emerged feeling like Alice in Wonderland when she ducked down the rabbit hole . Beyond the barrier mountain was a new , green , and quiet world . Humming of motors had given way to the lulling sound of cicadas and songs of birds . From a huddle of tiny houses two sinewy Taiwanese men appeared , naked except for shorts . Their legs were knotted with muscles and veins from years of pushing people and freight . After the dickering the Chinese love , we agreed on our fare to Chiaopanshan , only  | to find that at a way station we had to pay again " for maintenance of the railroad . " Every quarter-mile or so the push car ran off a bowlegged stretch of track and had to be lifted back on the rusted rails . Log bridges trembled with the ague of age as we crossed gorges cut by mountain streams . Mason , of the Engineers , marveled that these could bear our weight ( pages 149 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On downgrades the pushers ride , keeping the car from running away by crude homemade brakes . I recalled something a missionary had told me . " Are n't these push cars dangerous ? " he once asked a pusher . " No , " replied the coolie . " We always jump clear . Just the passengers get killed . " Of our own pushers we inquired , " Do many people get killed on this railroad ? " " Not so many , " was the reply . " Maybe , " said Mase , " he means not so many ' but what there could be a few more ! " Forewarned by all this , we were ready to jump as fast as any Formosan . As the way grew steeper and the pushing harder we lightened the load by walking ahead . Clouds wreathed the highest peaks . The wild mountain scenery , rank vegetation , and strange bird and insect calls were like something out of Herman Melville 's Typee or Omoo . Wild white lilies gleamed in the verdure , and the only sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird rose in a blur and roar of wings like a ruffed grouse . In the forests cicadas " zit-zitted " a ringing , monotonous , telegraphic tune of dots and dashes . Once we met push cars loaded with tea , and passenger traffic gave way to freight . Our coolies lifted our car off the track till the others had passed ( page 161 ) . " Miz Lee , " of Formosa 's First Families At last , across a deep ravine , we sighted the towering triangle of land on which stands Chiaopanshan , like a lookout on the prow of a ship . After duly checking in at the police station , we rolled up to an ex-Japanese inn , now run by a Taiyal , Mrs. Li Goat-kiau . " Good evenin ' , Miz Lee , how 're you-all , " said Virginia-born Joe as our slender , smiling hostess in slacks appeared with her dark-eyed little daughter . Though they could n't comprehend a word , they understood the good will in his drawl and grin . Mrs. Li had a quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interspersed with gold ones in accordance with the Oriental idea that they improve one 's looks . The tattooed " marriage mark " on her face formed a blue-black the an inch or more wide , running from ear to mouth , then up to the other ear . As one American remarked , " It 's cheaper than a wedding ring and more lasting . " A real lady , Mrs. Li wore this adornment with poise and apparent pride ( page 156 ) . It was pleasant to take off our dusty shoes and pad over polished . wood floors to a paperpaneled room where cushions had been spread around a low table . After a hot bath came food , served by Mrs. Li 's small daughter ? fried eggs , chicken , leeks , breadfruit , and bamboo-sprout soup ( served in the middle of the meal ) ; rice , too , of course ; tea , and sweet pineapple . ( Eating a fried egg with chopsticks gives quite a sense of achievement . ) Mrs. Li , a leader among her people , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1946. - " She say she resign , " explained the policeman , interpreting , " because she a lady and not want to do anything political . She say equality of man and woman not very convenient for woman . " For pictures of the true Taiyals our hostess suggested that we visit her home village , called Keikodai in Japanese , Chikoutai in Chinese , and Lahowsha ( meaning " leaning tree " ) in the Taiyal tongue . In Chiaopanshan , we knew , the tribesmen had intermarried with Formosan Chinese and few of the aboriginal ways survived . Giant Snails Travel Slowly But Far Hot sun burned through the clouds in the wake of an early-morning rain next day as we started down a steep trail toward a bridge like a spider web that crossed the Tanshui River ( page 141 ) . As we rounded a turn in the wet trail we almost stepped on a huge snail with a shell as big as a lemon . It was a handsome " twotone job " in cream color and brown . This portable home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches long which was bound for safety in trailside rock crevices at somewhat more than the usual snail 's pace , groping ahead with its feelers like a blind man with a cane . There was no mistaking this slimy stranger . Without any introduction we knew it to be Achatina fulica , the giant African land snail , whose legions are devouring vegetation on Saipan , Tinian , and other Pacific islands and have caused consternation by invading Hawaii . Recently it smuggled itself into the United States on salvaged war equipment landed in California and at New York and Baltimore , but the Department of Agriculture reports  | that all the invaders were detected and destroyed by plant quarantine inspectors . " It " is the only word for the creature . Every mature Achatina is both a he and a she , and this sexual versatility makes each snail a potential egg-layer . Seventeen years ago , giant snails spread to Formosa from China , and this subtropical island proved an Achatina Eden . We saw them later in distant areas , for they have made their relentless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital city they strip leaves and flowers from gardens . Formosan Chinese break the big shells and feed the sluglike bodies to ducks . Aborigines eat them ( pages 152 and 159 ) . Japanese once thought this oversize snail might be a made-to-order means of feeding their mounting population . Some were reared in glass houses in Tokyo , but proved to have little palate appeal . Fortunately for Japan , the climate there proved too cold for the snails to thrive in the open . Suddenly from ahead came a shout . Mason had almost stepped on a snake , a black fellow ringed with white and about five feet long . " If you are bitten by that snake , " a Taiwanese told us later , " you soon die . " All hands left the zebra-colored stranger strictly alone . It was a krait , Bungarus multicinctus , armed with a nerve poison more deadly than that of a cobra . Shaky Bridge Leads to Taiyal Town Another downward zigzag of the trail and we reached the Japanese-built bridge that spans the Tanshui River . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 yards long , with many holes and loose boards , suspended from cables of untwisted wire . A network of wires on each side serves as a safety net to keep pedestrians from falling  | into the wild mountain river a hundred feet below . Across the quaking bridge we saw little people approaching . On their backs men , women , and children bore bamboo hampers like fishermen 's creels . In answer to Virginia Joe 's pleasant " How 're y'all this mornin ' ? " tattooed faces creased into welcoming smiles though their owners understood not a word . " They are very pure-hearted , naive , " said Loa in an English aside as Mrs. Li explained our errand to her fellow Taiyals . They are also very strong , as I discovered when I tried on one of the hampers of rice they bore . It staggered me , much to their amusement . Yet little men and women of not more than five feet and 100 pounds carry these man-killing loads up the precipitous slope to Chiaopanshan . Several men had the tattooed chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Married women wore that nowfamiliar ear-to-ear band like a huge blue smile ( page 176 ) . " They accept us more naturally than some of the plains people , " murmured Loa in surprise after chatting with them in Japanese . U. S. Fertilizer on Formosan Fields With the sensations of a tightrope walker , we crossed the swaying , pitching bridge . Here the Tanshui seems a river of paint , its color almost battleship gray . Tons of soil and disintegrated rock were whirling downstream in its swift waters . Far down , where it reaches the sea , the once good harbor of Tanshui is suitable now only for small craft because of silting of the river mouth . As we climbed past the rice fields of Chikoutai , we saw two Taiyals staggering along with shoulder-suspended loads of nitrogenous  | fertilizer . On their return trip from Chiaopanshan they had brought the precious nutriment to their leached-out , hungry fields . This was the mountain " grass roots " end of the long arm of ECA . To prevent widespread want , disorder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooperation Administration was providing these essentials for good crops . The chemicals had to come at high cost from the distant USA and Canada because Japanese nitrate plants ? source of explosives as well as fertilizer ? were casualties of World War II and Japan 's postwar disarmament . Alas , " No Beautiful Dressing " At the first houses of Chikoutai , children shyly greeted us and reacted gleefully to the international language of American candy . The village had been shorn of most of its pulchritude . Its girls with their colorful dancing costumes had gone to the city of Hsinchu for several days to entertain Chinese Nationalist troops . Of those that remained Loa said tragically , " Some of them have no beautiful dressing . " Two of the houses seemed on fire , but investigation showed that the smoke was the overflow from stovepipeless kitchens . It found its way out around the airy edges of the bamboo roof . Houses were largely bamboo . When I emerged , eight or ten Taiyals were clustered about the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE which Joe always carried as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you looked around , " said Mason , " and they took it away from me. "  | Education , even here , is opening new doors . One handsome , intelligent young Taiyal spoke good English and explained that he was home on vacation from school in a distant city . Another young man had learned English while a prisoner of war in the Philippines . He called us all " captain " and kept announcing , " Americans very good ! " Younger Generation Untattooed , Four generations of Mrs. Li 's family showed how the life of the Taiyals is changing ? her dignified 80-year-old father and vivacious 51-year-old stepmother , both with the tribal facial tattoos ; tattooed 46-year-old Mrs. Li herself ; her son and daughter-in-law , both untattooed , and her 7-month-old grandchild , dressed with all the care of any American baby . Tribesmen puffing their bamboo pipes showed interest in a visitor 's cigar . Proffered , it went around the circle like a pipe of peace . Each sampler winced at its strength but politely tried to hide his distaste . Head-hunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but respond warmly to a smile and a friendly gesture ( pages 153 , 176 ) . We left to the accompaniment of Japanese " sayonaras " and something that sounded like " cigareyta , " meaning not " cigarette " but " good-bye " in Taiyal . After a hot , gruelling climb , we slumped on the floor of Mrs. Li 's inn , ate about what we had had for dinner the previous day and breakfast that morning , then started down the mountain on the push car .  | In the seven miles the car jumped the track 15 or 20 times , but nobody suffered more than a jolt , since the careful coolies , braking constantly , kept the speed down to about eight miles an hour . Emerging at last from the dark tunnel that formed the entrance to this different world , we drove back to teeming Taipei , slept , and boarded the jeep next morning for a trip around the island . Few persons make this arduous circuit , for neither roads nor rails entirely encircle Formosa ( map , page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we headed for Chiaochi on the east coast , over a bumpy , rocky , rollercoasterlike road through rankly wooded mountains studded with giant tree ferns . Artificial caves along the way had been blasted out by the Japanese for storing war supplies against the invasion that never came . Instead , the Allies struck at Okinawa , 370 miles northeast . Landslides had dumped tons of rock and dirt on the road , and crews of young peakhatted Taiwanese ? mostly girls ? were removing the debris in shoulder-suspended bamboo baskets . When they threw it over the cliff below , seconds passed before the sound reached us . After noon came the daily rain , this time a cloudburst that all but hid the road and yawning gulf . Discretion demanded a stop . Drenched , we turned in at the first shelter , a tiny house-store selling " ghost money , " cookies , tea , and straw hats . The Taiwanese girl in charge served us hot tea and would take no money . Candy bars and soap expressed our appreciation . On we went , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just at sunset the jeep rounded a turn , and we stared enthralled at the picture painted against the sky . We had reached the edge of the mighty escarpment . Far below lay a green plain and beyond it the Pacific . Offshore , like a sea monster , sprawled Kueishan ( Tortoise Mountain ) Island and a rocky islet forming the turtle 's head . Arched in glory around the scene , a rainbow formed a softly painted frame . American Tragedy : " No Blead " Still under the spell of this sight , we wound down the steep mountainside to Chiaochi , where we found a former Japanese inn . After a few words in Chinese , Chao-siang Wang , Mason 's interpreter , turned to us with tragic face . " They have no bread , " he said . Like almost every Taiwanese we met , Wang seemed to think Americans would die if they did not eat bread daily . Thanks to a huge dinner featuring chicken soup , pork , eggs , bamboo sprouts , big bowls of rice , tea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south next day toward Suao , we passed paper factories fed by wood from the mountains . Freight cars bore huge cryptomeria logs to be sawed into lumber . Camphor trees thrive in the mountains . Formosans hack the trees into chips , distill them , and send the product to Taipei for refining . Once camphor was a big money maker for Formosa , source of most of the - world 's supply , but large-scale manufacture of synthetic camphor from turpentine by Du Pont and others has reduced production of the natural kind to a minor industry . Glassy fields of rice between mountains and sea were dotted with Formosa 's white herons . These are cattle egrets that feed on insects flushed by plodding water buffaloes . At a pool by the road sat a Taiwanese boy . A small rope in his hand led down into the water . I thought he was fishing . Suddenly he jerked the rope and up came a huge slatecolored head with curving horns ? a water buffalo . Each of these giant creatures , used for tilling the fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 174 ) . One-lane Highway Carved from Cliffs Gradually the plain petered out , and at Suao the mountains came down to the sea . Here began the most spectacular and dangerous road I have seen , the Japanese-built east coast highway carved from the face of thousand-foot cliffs . At some points it is blasted through cliff walls ; we counted 14 tunnels ( pages 154 , 158 , 163 ) . This road is only a single track , with occasional turnout places ? but traffic is two-way . Several times we rounded a curve and just in time saw a truck or bus coming head on in the same narrow track . In places the outer edge of the road had caved away , carrying concrete guardrails with it , down to the turquoise-bordered sea hundreds of feet below . In their stead some joker had placed feeble little foot-high stones . At one point hundreds of golden-backed spiders seemed to have joined forces to ambush every flying insect in the vicinity . Their round webs , the size of an average window , hung from telephone wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for butterflies and other potential prey . In each sprawled a spider  | four or five inches across , ominously waiting for dinner to fly in . On the cliffs of soft schist and harder limestone crawled more of the giant African snails we had met near Chiaopanshan ( page 155 ) . Taiyal tribesmen , less clean than the ones seen there , were gathering and stewing them over campfires ( page 152 ) . Only the " best " part is eaten , the rest being fed to pigs . " How do they taste ? " we asked through an interpreter . " Delicious ! " was the reply , but none of us grasped the opportunity to try them . When we stopped at a Taiyal village we were almost mobbed , the aborigines were so enthusiastically friendly . In the cluster of huts stood a little wooden church with a big cross , and perhaps the tribesmen associated Americans with their much-loved missionary ( pages 147 and 169 ) . When we drove away the whole village came running after , waving and shouting good-byes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile . Soon we crossed the silt-laden Taroko River and on foot explored Taroko Gorge , a silent place of towering cliffs and occasional wildlooking Taiyals hunting snails , panning for gold , or scratching in lonely sweet-potato fields . Where the river dashes from this defile a hydroelectric power plant stood silent and idle , paralyzed by mounting banks of gray silt which blocked its outlet . One at Tungmen fared even worse ; it was buried bodily in sand when the river bed rose 56% feet ! One reason for the growing gravity of the problem was as apparent as if it had been emblazoned on the mountainsides ? increasing cultivation of steep slopes , usually for planting sweet potatoes . Formosans burn patches of mountain forest , grow a few crops till fertility is gone , then burn another slope . Heavy rains quickly leach out nutriment and carry more of the soil itself down to those laden streams . Site of Wartime Prison Camp At a troop encampment outside Hualienchiang , known to the Japanese as Karenko , athletic-looking Chinese soldiers were playing good basketball . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large sign in Chinese . " Stand Firm , " exhorted another . Here during wartime the Japanese maintained one of the prison camps which made Formosa synonymous with suffering to many an American soldier , including Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright , U. S. commander at Corregidor . Not even a jeep could go much farther south than Hualienchiang , harbor and site of a wartime Japanese aluminum plant . Here rails take over , forming a tenuous link with Taitung , 108 miles south . From a missionary we learned that rivers swollen by typhoon rains had washed out the railroad at several points and passengers had to walk across them , carrying their baggage . Joe , burdened with photographic equipment , decided to stay with the others and photograph the gay , dancing Amis ( pages 166-7 ) . At dawn next day I set out alone , the one white man in a jam-packed train of Formosan Chinese and a few aborigines . " If you are of good will you will have no trouble , " Wang the interpreter had said . I found it true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought an answering smile ? and help if I needed it . I wondered if a lone Formosan aboard a crowded American train and dependent entirely on sign language would have fared as well . Fellow passengers squeezed close together to make room for me to sit . On one side sat an aged grandma clutching a huge edible bamboo sprout and a grandson not much bigger . A farm woman across the way had clucking chickens in a bamboo basket . One man carried a live duck . Others had rice or other produce in gunny sacks or wrapped in matting . Five Walks in 108-mile Train Trip Our route lay across the Tropic of Cancer , and as the burning sun rose higher it turned the train into a series of ovens . All the passengers visibly wilted ; all except one , a Buddha-faced woman calmly nursing her baby . Her expression never changed . After several stops at noisy towns , the slowmoving train jerked to a standstill , a trainman jabbered something , and everybody began to get off , restrapping babies on backs , picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rice , and assorted bundles . I followed suit , shouldering my heavy bag . Outside was a strange , almost Biblical , sight ? a long procession of humanity winding across a wide gray waste of rock and silt , flood bed of a restless river . Bridge and approaches had been cut in several places . Rails with ties clinging to them formed a precarious footway across the now-shrunken sullen gray stream . As I looked , something shielded me from the sun ; a stranger was holding a parasol over me and my sunburned nose . In a halting handful of English words , this pleasant-faced little fellow passenger introduced himself as Mr. Tsu and a stocky friend as Mr. Tsung . Could they not , he asked , carry my bag ? At first I declined this friendly offer , but by  | the end of the two-mile trek they were carrying the bag and I was carrying the parasol . Four more times in that blazing day we all had to get out and walk across flood-wrought desolation to another train . At word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad had given up these bridges as lost and stationed trains between them to run this walk-ride shuttle service . Every time a typhoon comes , the rains turn the short , swift mountain rivers into giants of destruction that bowl down the low timberand-masonry bridges like tenpins . Now nearly naked coolies were rebuilding them , like pinboys " setting ' em up in the other alley . " " Why not end this interminable game by building higher , stronger bridges or even tunneling under the streams ? " I later asked a Chinese railroad official . " No money , " he replied . " People here on the east coast are poor and revenues are low . " That was true . My ticket cost the equivalent of 50 cents for a 108-mile , 13%-hour ride ( and walk ) . One of the aborigines aboard was an aging Ami man carrying a mat and a burlap pack and wearing no clothes except a waist string from which a cloth the size of a handkerchief hung down in front . He was the envy of all when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he untied the string , dunked himself in a brook beside the train , " dressed " in half a second , and climbed aboard , cool and dripping . Ami Women Smoke Big Cheroots On another " portage " I passed two Ami women in Western-style dresses embellished with bits of red-and-blue cloth . Arms swinging , they walked with exquisite grace . I passed them , and did a double take : Clamped in the mouth of each was a huge pale-brown cheroot . Farther south , a brown-faced Bunun boy in an old Japanese army cap insisted on carrying my bag ; he would accept no reward .  | After these hot , tiring treks , children came aboard in tears . To console one small Taiwanese girl , I gave her a pellet of candycoated chewing gum . Her father thought it was medicine and tried to get her to swallow it . She only cried the more . When I demonstrated the use of gum , she chewed it and shower gave way to sun . Wooden seats got harder and harder . One well-dressed Taiwanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down . High mountains , often scarred with farms , looked down on the plain through which we passed . The Japanese developed this area for irrigated farming , but mountain rivers writhe out of bounds , spewing silt over rice and sugar cane . Toward the end of the all-day rail-and-foot trip a little Chinese fellow passenger spoke to me in good English , and I realized suddenly how keen had been the hunger for conversation . Mr. Chou , a refugee from Canton , was bound for the west coast , as I was ; we decided to travel together . Next Stage by U. S.-made Bus At Taitung , minor port and end of the railroad , my new friend found us an inn and managed to buy us hard-to-get tickets for the next stage of the trip , by bus . The one we boarded next morning was a Ford , jammed with luggage and passengers , including a squad of Chinese soldiers in peaked brown caps , shorts , shirts , and basketball shoes . Until I made an overture , these rifle-toting troopers seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered me a bunch of longans , small pulpy fruits with a nut-brown skin . Only once did we have to walk , across a flood-weakened bridge . Empty except for the driver , the Ford crossed gingerly but safely .  | Music was Mr. Chou 's hobby , and when it rained he sang an Ami rain song . " It means , " he explained , " that the rain is like a young girl 's tear . The Ami mind is simple , but the heart is good . " Skirting high cliffs and threading wild mountains , we finally crossed the southern end of the island and reached the fertile western plain at Linpien on the west coast railway . Waiting for a train were tall young members of the Chinese Fourth Air Force , their unit shoulder patches attached with safety pins . Hereabouts , airfields abound . These and the big naval port of Kaohsiung ( Takao ) were used by the Japanese as springboards for their attack on the Philippines . Under the Chinese Nationalists , Kaohsiung is still a closely guarded military area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to Taipei in size . When we reached Pingtung and found a former Japanese inn , Mr. Chou disappeared into the night , though rain was pelting down . In an hour he returned with a loaf of " blead " for me . He had scoured the city for it in the rain . Signs of Wars 300 Years Apart Past fields of sugar cane and pineapple , banana plantations , and paddies , we chugged next day to historic Tainan , once the capital of the island and now its third largest city . A good Western-style hotel occupies part of the railroad station ( pages 145 , 151 ) . As I passed an open door , I saw a white man pounding a typewriter and realized with a start that this was the first white face I had seen in two and a half days . The welcome acquaintance was Herbert G. Bennett , an Englishman selling American lubricating oil to sugar-cane crushing mills . In Tainan , as in other principal cities , the seat of local government had been neatly pinpointed by wartime bombing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital spots , " said Herb , who had served as an officer in the Royal Air Force . " The aluminum factory in Takao was 60 percent destroyed , but not the big cement mill there . Cement was needed for postwar reconstruction . " At the Sun Moon Lake power plants , bombers got the transformer stations without destroying the turbines . Beautiful bombing ! " U. S. Air Force and Navy pilots share the credit for such hamstringing , and British carrier planes attacked Formosan airfields . At Tainan , too , are mute survivors of a far older war ? brick forts built by the Dutch more than 300 years ago . After nearly forty years they were driven out , and the island was restored to the Ming Dynasty by the warrior Cheng Chen Kung , or Koxinga as the Japanese call him . This fighting son of a Chinese father and Japanese mother is still a hero to Chinese , Japanese , and Formosans ( page 165 ) . In Anping , Tainan 's old port , I found the remnant of Fort Zeelandia being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected upon the brick ramparts by the Japanese , I looked out to sea and down on the town , which seems to contain less land than water ? large ponds for making big fish out of little ones . Down a canal ghosted a fishing boat with rakish , reddish , triangular sail . Fort Providentia , in the heart of Tainan , looks about as Dutch as a pagoda . Koxinga rebuilt it in Chinese style , and now its ornate dragon-crowned but leaky roof shelters a museum ( page 164 ) . " To become an army officer in the Ching Dynasty , a man had to be able to lift this stone , " said my young Chinese guide , tugging vainly at a rock about the size and shape of a small safe . " Formerly I think Chinese people more strong , same as Western people . " I had left Mr. Chou in the bosom of his family , newly arrived by air from Canton , but just before I boarded a train for the north he hurried into the station . Friendly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formosa tea . Saltcellar and Sugar Bowl The west coast train was prompt and comfortable and never required its passengers to walk . Here the coastal plain is wide and green , unravaged by rampaging rivers . Fields full of sugar cane 's waving swords alternated with green-rowed mirrors of rice , fruit plantations , and vegetable gardens beside farmhouses of brick and tile . Saltcellar as well as a rice , sugar , and fruit bowl , the southwest coast makes salt from the sea and annually ships thousands of tons to Japan for industrial use , chiefly from Putai and Kaohsiung . Distributing centers for farm produce are such cities as Chiai and Taichung , roughly the size of Bridgeport , Connecticut , and Fort Worth , Texas . Many of the sugar-cane crushing mills that abound in this part of the island were " pranged " during the war , but repairs have been pushed . Major industries are controlled by the Taiwan Provincial Government , and in Taipei an official declared that the output of its Taiwan Sugar Company had risen 398 percent since 1946 . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production still is far below the prewar level . Most industries and cities get their light and power from the Sun Moon Lake hydroelectric plants , pulsing heart of Formosa ( page 168 ) . This lofty lake is a tourist resort , but the plants themselves are closely guarded and soldiers warned the photographer away . Here the Generalissimo had one of his mountain aeries , alternating his residence between Sun Moon Lake and sulphur-smelling Tsaoshan , hot-spring resort in the mountains north of Taipei . Formosa Faces an Uncertain Future On a day of alternate sun and rain we jeeped among the dead volcanoes that look down on Tsaoshan . In a smelly , yellowish valley workmen were extracting yellow crystals from sulphur-laden waters . On the mountainsides grew tiers of tea shrubs and orange trees . When we stopped at a roadside inn , a phonograph struck up " Anchors Aweigh " and ' The Caissons Go Rolling Along " in our honor . Over a steep overgrown road we drove to the crest of a grass-covered mountain . No maps showed this road , a secret one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital city , in the wide , shallow valley of meandering rivers , the Tanshui and Chilung . Beside the latter , road and rails ran toward Chilung , the capital 's port . What did the future hold for this island , scene of a bloody postwar revolt , refuge of Nationalists , goal of Communists , prize coveted again by Japan , lying squarely between United States bases in the Philippines and Okinawa ? Across the green land the rivers wrote great silver question marks .  |
