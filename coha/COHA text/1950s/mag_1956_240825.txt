Christians revere the Bible as a treasury of divine revelation ; skeptics regard it as an unreliable collection of fable and folklore . Over the past century a host of **25;17955;TOOLONG , geologists , astronomers , botanists-have added a third perspective . Beneath the barren plains and foothills of the ancient Biblical country , they have made discoveries revealing that , whatever else it may be , the Bible is a remarkably faithful chronicle of history . In The Bible as History ( William Morrow &; Co. ; $5.95 ) , published in the U.S. next week , German Scientific Journalist Werner Keller skillfully sifts and summarizes the recent archaeological and scientific discoveries relating to Biblical times and places . The result is a lively blend of drama and reporting that reads like a detective story grafted on a history book . <P> Significant Mud . Digging through ancient rubbish at Ur near the Persian Gulf in 1929 , British and American archaeologists came upon a 10-ft. layer of mud far beneath the surface . Underneath the layer they discovered artifacts from the Stone Age . Excitedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have found the Flood . " Tests in surrounding areas showed that the layer of clay was the residue of a vast , catastrophic deluge that had in about 4000 B.C. covered the river plains of southern Mesopotamia , the center of the known world of that time . <P> Such discoveries may disconcert the skeptics , but other findings are bound to upset Biblical fundamentalists , who insist on miracles where science is ready to offer natural explanations . Many scientists are now convinced that the rocks which Moses struck , " and the water came out abundantly , " were water-storing limestone , whose hard crust was broken by the blow . The bush that " burned with fire " and yet " was not consumed " could have been either the gas plant fraxinella , whose highly volatile oils sometimes ignite if approached with a naked flame , or certain mistletoe twigs whose crimson blossoms in full bloom resemble flames . As for the manna that nourished the Israelites in the desert , an expedition in 1923 confirmed an old suspicion : the manna was doubtless an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree is attacked by a species of plant louse , the substance oozes out , crystallizes and drops to the ground , where the Isiaelites found it . Without debating the divine intervention that the Bible clearly indicates , Keller points out that this secretion has all the appearances and properties of the manna the Bible describes ( " and it was like coriander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey " ) . The Israeli government , relying on the newly confirmed stature of the Bible as botanical expertise ( " and Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba " ) , recently planted 2,000,000 tamarisk trees there .
