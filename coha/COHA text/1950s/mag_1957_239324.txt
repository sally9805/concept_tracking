New Play in Manhattan A Clearing in the Woods ( by Arthur Laurents ) found a fairly new way to treat a neurotic woman . The treatment-which was theatrical , not medical , and consisted of physically landscaping her troubled mind and fleshing her ugly memories-was unsuccessful , as it was basically unwise . But in a flabby season , at least Playwright Laurents ( The Time of the Cuckoo ) attempted something provocative and at times achieved something striking ; and Kim Stanley ( Bus Stop ) was frequently brilliant in a taxing role . <P> The play had its overwrought romantic egoist of a heroine delving among memories of her father , of the men in her life , and of herself at earlier stages ( played by three other actresses who vaguely resembled her ) . <P> Against Oliver Smith 's fine woodland set-a sort of field-and-stream of consciousness-the self-probing yielded moments both of sharp fantasy and of sharp perception . But an ultra-subjective method , which by now is a commonplace of fiction , has no proper place in drama . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than vice versa , but that such mental voyaging , in the theater , is seldom sly , swift and aberrant enough to seem real , nor cumulative enough to be dramatic . <P> Choked with method and starved for substance , the play offered only a predicament , not a situation , while the situations that led to the predicament rarely individualized the heroine or galvanized the story . Hers were all-too-familiar aggressions and hurts and guilts ; and she too was only a predicament , never really a person .
