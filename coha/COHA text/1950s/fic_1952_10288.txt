know he wants to see me ? We met him together . You are the beautiful one . I do n't know what to say to him . Please come , darling . We do n't even know which one it is . " Though she knew well enough , having no more than heard the pitch of that voice which in the moment of meeting had seemed to be engraved on her heart forever . " Do n't lie to me or I will not help you , " said her friend . " Why did n't he bring one for you ? " said Lottie loyally . " I do n't think that 's fair . " On the porch , when they listened , as they did from time to time , they heard Hilda laugh . An intense pang of jealousy struck Lottie to the heart . She looked at herself in the little mirror , her serious face questioning her as she did so . God , she had to go ! Not now . What is the matter with me ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go , " said her friend . " I want to look at the baby . Go . I will come in a minute . " So , the moment having come when she must see for herself what her fate would be : " Wish me luck , " she said . " I do , " said her friend , and threw a kiss to her as she walked out , stiff and fearful , through the room with the big fireplace , the guns the books , Hilda 's harmonium  --  over the uneven , half-sunken floor , out onto the side porch and the cool night air . It was still light enough to see the cows coming in across the far pasture and her uncle with the dog following them . Lottie paused , then taking her courage in her hands , rounded the end of the porch and saw Hilda , the young man facing her , his broad back and fine head bent forward talking earnestly . Hilda was entranced with what he was saying . Lottie had not yet been noticed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . " This is a young man who says . . . " " Hello , Lottie , " said John . " Hello , John . " Lottie was n't going to be beaten . " Sit down . I 'll sit here . " The light was fading over the valley , butp176enough was left for the young girl to know that her instincts had not been deceived , this was a man such as she had dreamed of , that she had never seen at close range . Such a man as she could hope and dare to call her own . In him lay the answers . " He likes Chopin 's music ! " said Hilda . " Chopin ! " said Lottie incredulously , and then , to herself , I did n't come here to talk about Chopin . " I have been telling him all about your three years in Germany . " The nerve of her , thought Lottie . " He is so romantic ! " Hilda said , out into the night . " What ? " " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so delicate , yet so bold . It reflects the soul ! " You and your soul , thought Lottie . You do n't even know what music is . Aloud , she said , " Where is your friend Tom ? " " I could n't pry him loose . He would n't dress . " " We would n't have cared . Nobody dresses here . Elvira will be disappointed . " " So I came alone . " " I 'm glad . " He gave her a quick look , as Hilda began again . " Music is the language of the heart . That is why in thiscountry they have no composers . Everything here is money , money , money . That is strange , too , because there are somany beautiful places here which should inspire people . " " Well , we 've got the songs of Stephen Foster . " " I do n't know his songs . " Lottie did n't , either , but shekept quiet . " Tell me some of the names . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " " Yes , I suppose so . But those are Negro songs . " " Not necessarily . " " But what have you got to equal Schubert ? I used to sing them when I was young . " God , thought Lottie , do n't start now !  | " And do you know Tchaikovsky 's None but the Lonely Heart ? ' " " Yes , I 've heard it . " " Do you sing ? " asked Lottie , with a thrill . " You have such a beautiful speaking voice . " " Yes , has n't he ? I noticed it right away . That 's why we were speaking of music . " At that moment Elvira appeared . It was getting quite dark where the old farmhouse stood hard against the little hill which protected it in winter to the north and west . But across to the east the tops of the long ridge , enclosing the little valley where the pastures lay , were still in the sunlight . It was a tranquil sight , the intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the nostalgic sense that inspires all that semimountainous country . John rose and moved a chair into the semicircle . " Hello , John , " Elvira said . " Where are the others ? " " Yes , we would like to make their acquaintance , " saidHilda . " Another time you must all come , and we can sing . " " Was n't it nice of him to come alone ? " " Yes , " said Elvira . " Do you like it here in the country ? " " He is a musician , " said Hilda . Oh God , thought Lottie . Why has n't she sense enough to go in the house ? " We were talking of the great music which has been left to us by such men as Schumann . He was a true romantic . And Chopin . I do not like Wagner . He is too coarse . What is delicate and of the soul in such music ? But Grieg  --  you know Grieg ? " To hell with Grieg , thought Lottie furiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite dark now and the night wind had begun . " Let us go inside . I am chilly , " said Hilda . Hooray ! thought Lottie . " Let me get you your shawl , " Elvira put in . " Oh , it 's not cold , " said Lottie . But at that point John got up and said he 'd better be moseying , he had just come for a short call , and that the others would be expecting him back at camp.  | " Oh no ! You 've just arrived . " " Wo n't you come in ? We can have a cup of coffee and a piece of cake . " But Lottie had made up her mind . Something had to be done to get Hilda out of the way . " I know , " she said , " it 'll be dark on the road to the lake . Let 's walk down to the main road with you . " She knew that would settle her dear auntie ! And she would have him near her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will be dark for you coming back alone , " said Hilda . " Oh that 's nothing . Elvira and I have done it often be-fore . " So Hilda was left wistfully alone on the high porch and the two girls and the tall young man dropped down over the lawn  --  Lottie would not let him help her down the steps  --  sliding down the grass to the gravelly road , and at once were lost to the view of the lady in the dark above them . " Good-bye , come again , " she called after them . " Goodbye , " he called back from the darkness of the hollow road . They could see her , standing above them against the light , though she could no longer see them . She breathed deeply , looking across the valley , and then turned and went indoors . The road was pitch-black as it started into the tunnel made by the century-old maples growing along the stone fence at the edge of the pasture . This was exciting . " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes will get used to it . " " Oh , I 'm getting into the ditch . " " Come up here , " said Lottie . " Here , follow my voice . " " Oh , I 'm all right now . Are there any snakes here ? " " No , not in Vermont , " said 3ohn . " Men are the only snakes you 'll find here . " And he laughed . " Do they bite ? " said Lottie . " Not often , " said John.  | " That 's too bad . " And she sniggered at her own daring They knocked together in the dark deliciously . " Are you all right , Elvira ? " " Yes , I am all right . I wish your friend , " she said to John , " had been braver . Was he afraid of us ? I think he was afraid . You were very brave to come alone . " " I think it was wonderful , " said Lottie . And then , she could scarcely believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that she had never felt in her life before . It gripped her firmly , without hesitation , live , giving , governing her uncertain steps . It was an arm , his arm about her waist . She did not hesitate ; she welcomed it . It startled her , but something within her at that moment surrendered . She was afraid only that he would withdraw it . She walked carefully so as to keep near him as she wanted to do . If he had released her then , her disappointment would have been as if the whole world had collapsed and she would have been left alone upon the crumbling edge of an abyss . It was her whole passionate resolve to keep that arm in that place , touching her , steadying her through life . They were coming out from under the heavier trees now . Oh , keep your arm there , she wanted to tell him . " Are you cold ? " she said . " No . Why ? " he said unsteadily . His teeth chattering . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to say more , that he was trembling . She had instinct enough to not give him away to Elvira . She knew . She was thrilled . " You are beautiful ! " he managed to say to her under his breath . When they came out into the light where the heavy trees ended he did not remove his arm . So it was confessed . Elvira saw it out of the corner of her eye and stood a little way off . " Oh , why did n't your friend come with you ? We could have had so much fun . Do you do your own cooking at your camp ? What do you have to eat ? " " Bacon and eggs and fish we catch in the lake . Yesterdayp180we had barbecued steaks . They were swell . And fried pota-toes . " " I wish we could cook you something . Do you like homemadepie ? " So it was agreed before they separated at the end of the side road to the farm , that the girls would come to the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow it for sure . But Mrs. Aldrich 's pies were famous in the neighborhood . Without telling anyone , the girls would order them the day before . Somehow or other , under one excuse or another , they 'd sneak away . They talked of it excitedly on the way back . " Something is breathing there ! " Lottie gave a stifled scream . " Why am I so nervous ? It 's only the old cow . " Somehow they managed it , put on their sheerest , most fluffy organdy dresses , and in haste lest they be questioned and detained , got away  --  after lunch in the early afternoon . Out of breath , they had run down the dirt road to get beyond the turn before Grandma should see them . Puffing , they leaned against a tree for a moment , carefully so as not to soil their dresses before proceeding . There were heavy clouds to the west , but the sun was shining and the world was brilliantly lighted . They were a pretty sight on the road in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good lady had delayed . " Oh , the pies are ready , " she guessed . " But they 're still in the oven . Pretty hot . " " Oh , we ca n't wait for them to cool . Leave them in the pans . Make one bundle of them . I 'll carry them , " said Lottie . Mrs. Aldrich slid them into a big brown-paper bag she had , put a good layer of paper between them , tied them , still hot , in a clean cloth , and the girls started up the road . They were about halfway to the camp when the storm broke . The first they knew of it was when the sky quite suddenlydarkened and there was a thunderclap ahead of them just over the hill . They were fairly caught . The rain beganp181almost at once . The girls took to the woods , stepping gingerly along among the tall weeds . Another lightning flash followed by a loud thunderclap terrified Lottie , freezing her mind . She saw herself doomed , a just retribution for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She clung to Elvira , holding the pies level as best she could . The terror of death was upon her . She was not resigned . It was at her the lightning was aimed to destroy her just now when she had been happy for the first time in her life . No one cared . She had always been alone . That was what music was to her , something into which she could escape , something to comfort her in a lonely world . Against that world the lightning was aimed . It was a world of sin . All her desires were sinful . A blinding flash of lightning instantly followed by a terrifying thunderclap filled the world about her . She thought her time had come . " That was pretty close , " said Elvira . " What shall we do ? There is nothing to do . " Then it really rained . And from fear for their lives , it turned to fear for their clothes . There was no adequate shelter . Lottie still clung to the pies , but the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drooped , their sheer dresses clung to their breasts and their thighs . Then the rain , as suddenly as it had come , subsided and quit , a typical summer flash storm in the mountains . They looked at each other and began to laugh . " What sights we are ! " " Oh my God ! The pies ! " said Lottie , having felt somethingsticky down her right leg . " Oh ! " and she collapsed . The contents of both pies , softened by the rain , had run out and all down the side of her dress . " Damn ! " said Lottie , her white hat hanging about her ears , looking down at her own sturdy legs to which the dress was stuck . Out of sheer instinct she pulled it away from where it was stuck to her belly . Elvira let out a hearty , chuckling laugh . She leaned against the beech under which they had sheltered themselves , finally , and threw her arms around it laughing.  |p182But  Lottie was mad . " What do we do now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home . We ca n't let them see us this way . Look at us . And the pies ! " " We ca n't go home , " said Lottie . " We 'll get the devil . " " We could go to Mrs. Aldrich 's kitchen . " But Lottie was inconsolable . " All my beautiful dreams ! " seemed to be written on her features . As if in reply to disappointment , at that moment the sun came out in all its summer brilliance , the storm had passed , and the air , freshened by the downpour , was as sweet as young lone . Elvira , who was anything but dull , saw how it was and decided , in her devil-maycareway , to give her friend the support she needed to go on to the end of the adventure . " Look ! The sun , " said Elvira . " We said we would bring them something nice . Come on . They will understand . " Lottie could have kissed her . And so they went along like drowned rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence . As they approached the tent under the trees they hesitated . No one was in sight . " Yuhoo ! " they called . A strange head stuck itself out from between the tent flaps , disappeared again . Then the four campers piled out . " We got caught in the shower , " said Lottie . " What do we do now ? " First they laughed their heads off . Then , having looked the girls over : " We ca n't just stand here looking at you , " said Tom . " You got ta get yourselves dried off . Look , go on in the tent , we 've got a fire in there , and see what you can do for yourselves . " That was fair enough . And that 's the way it went for the next half-hour . For of course the dresses did n't dry , though the girls had taken them off and done the best they could with them by the smoky fire . Finally they put them on again , stained with the pies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaps of the tent and came out into the sunlight once more.  |p183They  had fixed their hair and carried their hats in their hands . They were tall , good-looking girls and the boys now fully realized it . " We have n't seen you at all , " said Tom . " Too bad we did n't have our bathing suits with us . " " Too bad we could n't even take a walk together . Or a ride in your boat or anything . " " And we 're leaving Sunday . " " Oh ! " Lottie 's heart sank . " Are n't we going to see you ever any more ? " " There 's a dance at the inn Saturday night . Will you be there ? " " Yes , " said Lottie , though it was the first she had heard of it . " Wo n't we , Elvira ? " " Yes , " said her friend . And that 's the way it was left , as the girls , Lottie holding John 's hand , walked down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances could they do ? They said good-bye at the crossroad , the girls going on alone . " He might at least have kissed me . " Elvira looked at her . " You poor girl . We did n't have a good time . We must see if at the dance you can not at least go behind the inn with him . You should have at least one kiss . " But they were approaching the house and Grandma would be on the lookout . " And if she finds out what we have been doing , she will make a terrific fuss . I can hear father Donnervettering when she tells him . " They crept up the far bank at the back of the house and went around to peep in the kitchen window . No one was there . They got in at the rear door under the hill where the slop pails stood , tiptoed upstairs without being seen , undressed in a hurry , jammed their half-wet dresses in a corner , dressed in other clothes and  --  got away with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Here was the man whom she had sworn in her secret heart to lovep184forever . " Love is like that , " she said to herself . " Someone appears , someone you never thought of , someone you know at once was made for you and . . . he is the one . " " What did he say to you that first night ? " " When ? " said Lottie , knowing full well what was meant . " Miss Innocence , you know what I mean ; the night we walked down the road together . What did he say that got you so excited ? " " Nothing , " said Lottie . " I asked him if he was cold and he said no . He was shaking . " Elvira laughed , Lottie did not know why . " So he was shaking . That 's very funny . And were you shaking ? " " No , I felt fine . " " I can imagine . " I 'm not going to tell her what he said to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a big beard coming out of a cloud . There was a flash of lightning , rain chased her into the woods where she entered a cave . The night of the dance , by luck a beautiful evening , the girls hitched up old Charlie , and drove the three miles into town . The air was perfumed , the brook noisy as they came out of the cut beyond the Hall farm , crossed the wooden bridge and clattered past the first old white buildings of the town itself . There was a good crowd at the tavern , but they had no trouble finding a hitching place for the horse , being careful of their pretty summer dresses . Hilda had come with them as chaperone . " Tables ? " They had to take a table . They had n't figured on that . A piano , a violin and a horn were the music . They had already heard the sounds of the two-step as they approached the brightly lighted inn . There were Japanese lanterns under the trees . The evening was windless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candles shed their glowp185under the trees . Lottie 's glance went about the room looking among the laughing couples for her man . He was definitely not there . But a group was arriving as the girls at a table , quite at the back , watched the dancers get up and the men put their arms about their partners ' waists and move off upon the polished floor . It was they ! Entering as the music began " The Mosquito Parade , " they did n't wait , but grabbed their partnersand began at once to dance . For they had girls with them ! For Lottie the evening was ruined . " Why did n't they at least tell us ? " John had the decency a little later to come over to their table and make his excuses : the girls had surprised them , had appeared quite unexpectedly in the afternoon . What could they do ? " Is that your girl I saw you dancing with ? " " No , I have n't any girls . " " The way she had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it look that way . " " Do n't be so obvious , " Elvira whispered in Lottie 's ear . " Do you want to meet them ? " " No , I hate them . I do n't suppose we 'll see you any more . So good-bye . " " I 'm sorry you feel that way , " said John . " We could n't help it . Well , good-bye . " He held out his hand , but Lottie pretended not to see it . Another dance was on . John turned and left . " You should n't have done that , " said Elvira . " Let 's go home , " said Lottie . " No . Ca n't we have a dance together ? Do n't let them see they have made you so unhappy . " So the two girls danced together . There were several who were doing the same . Twice as she passed near John she refused to answer his glance . " Look at the cheap thing he 's dancing with . Look at the dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look at them all ! I think they are nothing but factory workers . Horrid . What ap186fool I was not to see it ! Come on , let 's get out of here . " " So early home ? I think it is a very pretty dance . " But Sunday afternoon Lottie could not contain herself any longer . She had to have the last word and without difficultypersuaded Elvira to go with her on a casual walk out to the lake . What else was there to do in this place ? So again they were walking that road once so exciting to their spirits , now a dirge . They saw a wagon coming and in it the four campers and all their gear . John was in the front seat . He motioned to the driver to slow down . It looked as if they would stop , but just as Lottie was expecting to greet her lover in her best and most forgiving manner the driver , without looking up , gave the reins a slap and they moved slowly past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop . Then in her rage and frustration Lottie did something for which she was eternally sorry . Lifting her voice after the departingwagon she called out , " Good riddance to bad rubbish . " If the cart had stopped and they had turned back to ask her what she meant she would not have known what to answer . But fortunately or unfortunately it kept on and that was the end of it . Three days later she got a letter from John asking her , in fact , what she had meant by such a remark . But it was all over by that time . She did n't answer him . On Monday the girls dug down into the bottom of the clothes closet to get their dresses , so they could wash them apart from the rest of the laundry . They were amazed at what they saw . The lovely white organdy was stained all colors of the rainbow , , greens , rusty reds , oranges and purples by the mold . It was so bad , what with the soot added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy them.  | " So this is the night for which you 've been waiting ever since we came to this neck of the woods . " " Put on your shirt so I can tie your necktie for you . It 's almost half-past eight and we ca n't keep the cab waiting after it comes . " Joe buttoned his dress shirt at the throat . Gurlie was sitting with her hair newly waved , her gold-spangled lilac silk gown pulled up about her plump knees , her low shoes before her , shoulders slumped forward looking appraisingly at her man . " Ah , you make me tired , " she said . " You 've been half an hour getting into that shirt . " " God damn it ! " said Joe in a suppressed fury . " It 's enough to choke a man . I do n't want to go where you 're draggingme . Send the cab away . Tell them we 've changed our " We 've been invited by our good friends , and if you wantact like a fool you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going even ' , without you if you act this way . I 'll tell them you 're sick if you want me to , but you 're not going to keep me home . " " All right , " he said . " I give up . Tie my tie . " " When I get these shoes on you 'll have to do up my dress in the back . Get a shake on you . You look fine . You look fine in a dress suit . It makes you look distinguished . I bet you 'll be the best-looking man in the room . "  |p188When  the door was opened to them by a maid , the first thing they saw in the front hall was a stuffed bear cub holding himself erect as part of an umbrella stand and hat rack . Upstairs Gurlie found no one else in the ladies ' room , so that she had a chance to look around . It was a prettily arranged bedchamber with dark mahogany furniture , rather old-fashioned in style but of an established appearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champetre , " by Corot , a sepia print , next to the mirror on one wall near the high-backed double bed . She took off her wraps and was standing preparatory to going down when a large , gray-haired woman appeared , her head in a light shawl . Gurlie did not know her , made some excuse looking down , as was her manner . " I 'm Mrs. Mills , " the lady said . " Mrs. Stecher is my name , " said Gurlie . " I beg pardon ? I 'm a little . . . " " Mrs. Stecher , " said Gurlie louder . " Oh yes , Mrs. Stecher . I have heard of you . " " Excuse me , " said Gurlie . " I am going downstairs . " As she descended she saw Joe 's back just as he disappeared into a group of men . Gurlie went to the wide double door leading into the parlor where the club members were assembled . There was a great talking and laughing and there she stood , a smile on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had noticed her . It gave her a good chance to see these people . She looked about . At the end of the room was a full-length painting of Mr. Arents in hunting costume , a Jaeger hat with a feather in it on his head and carrying a shotgunat ease over his arm . Standing with her hands joined before her , Gurlie played with the ring on the third finger of her left hand , turning it round and round , first one way , then the other . It was a large opal , her birthstone , for everyone else unlucky , but for those born in October a magic token on which one could rely . She wore no wedding ring . In Scandinavia the bride and groomp189exchange rings . When Joe refused to accept and wear one she also had refused  --  so it was left at that . Her hands were plump , the fingers thick and powerful , her full neck , bare , was decoratedby a simple string of amber beads ; smiling at no one , for that brief moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostess suddenly realized the situation and with a little cry rushed to her side . " Oh I am so sorry ! " she spoke with a very slight German accent . " I did n't see you ! " " That 's nothing , " said Gurlie . " Who is that sitting over there ? " Meanwhile Joe was being introduced to the men in the dining room . The ladies , as usual , having congregated in one place for their preliminary chatter , the men , a little awkward in their dress clothes , gathered in another , about the decorated dining-room table . " This is my friend Joe Stecher , " the host and mayor of the town was saying . He had a high , bulbous forehead and wore strong glasses . A little , reddish-haired , balding fellow bowed several times as he put out his ladylike hand and in a falsetto voice said , " How do you do ? " Joe liked him at once . " Oh , I am so sorry ! " said Mrs. Arents to Gurlie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You already know many of these people , I am sure . " And with that she led Gurlie by the arm , solid , round and bare to the shoulder , to some of the ladies who were already seated . " First let us go to see our old friend Mrs. Nagel . She is our patriarch  --  no , that would be a man . Matriarch would be a better term . " The old lady did not attempt to get up . " This is the wife of a very prominent man , " said Mrs. Arents to her , " Mrs. Joseph Stecher . Mrs. Stecher , this is Mrs. Nagel , one of our dearest and most beloved women ... " " Yes , I have met her , " said Gurlie . " You have met her ? Of course , at the Literary Club . " Then to the older lady , " Mrs. and Mrs. Stecher are our guests for the evening . "  | " I 'm very pleased to see you , " said the old lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet him . " " He is with the men , " said the hostess . " They are impos-sible . " Gurlie was conscious of being carefully studied by a dumpy little woman on her left who , as soon as she was brought before her , began to clear her throat and look nervouslydown at the carpet . " This is Mrs. Fletcher , " said the hostess . " Mrs. Joseph Stecher . " Gurlie could n't see the other 's eyes , could hardly , in fact , hear her say anything more than a mumble , with a smirk . She nodded her own head and moved on around the roughly assembled circle of chairs . " Who was that ? I did n't hear , " she managed to ask her introducer as they moved to the next chair . " Mrs. Fletcher , one of our new members . " " I could n't hear anything she said , " Gurlie observed . " Oh , she 's very shy . But her husband is just the opposite . They are very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . This is Mrs. Greer . . . " " How do you do ? " said Gurlie . The lady put out her hand which Gurlie , not expecting it , took with a firm grip , then let go as fast . " Her husband is the Borough Assessor . Mrs. Greer has a wonderful garden . " " Oh , " said Gurlie , " that 's good . " " What is the name ? " said the lady in question . " Oh , I beg your pardon . Mrs. Stecher , Mrs. Joseph Stecher . " Then , turning to Gurlie , " Mrs. Greer was a Stuart , one of our New Jersey aristocrats . They have lived in Riverdale  --  herfamily , I mean  --  since colonial times . " " Good , " said Gurlie . And looked hard at the erect posture , the courteous , self-possessed 4nanner . Gurlie admired her . " And this is Mrs. Lincoln , Mrs. Stecher . " This was a rather heavy-set woman , with a bold but sad smile , her mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I have heard of you . It is a pleasure to see you here this evening .

They always do the same thing ; till the last minute , they keep to themselves . Sit here a minute , with Mrs. Lincoln , here is an empty chair . We will introduce you to the others later . " " Yes , please sit down . It 's so tiresome to be dragged around and the names . . . " " I ca n't remember any names so far , " said Gurlie . " Yes , I was going to say that . It 's always the same . We will introduce ourselves again later . Is your husband here ? Everyone is interested to know what he looks like . " Gurlie laughed for the first time , her raucous laugh . " My little Dutchman 's all right , " she said . Mrs. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call him that ? " she questioned . But Gurlie had turned to her neighbor on the opposite side , who had patted her arm . It was one of her church associates . " Glad to see you here , " she half-whispered , and batted her eyes knowingly at Gurlie . " This is a nice group of people . Glad to see you . Oh , here come the men . It 's about time . Is that your husband ? With the moustache ? " " Yes , " said Gurlie . " He 's handsome ! " , said the little woman . " Look how straight he holds himself . So that 's your husband . Hm ! He looks smart . " " Yes , he 's a smartie , " said Gurlie . " How you talk ! " said Mrs. Lincoln . " But do n't you think we have a fine-looking lot of men in our club ? I think so .

"  | " I beg your pardon , gnadige frau , " apologized the mayor . " Go on ! " said Gurlie . " Let him meet the others . " Then , as the various men were brought before her by the hostess and introduced , she bowed , half-closing her eyes , and mumbled the semblance of names she could not rightly hear . She noticed , nevertheless , the heavy , the slow , the smiling , the blue eyes , those with abundant wavy hair .. . At that moment , a lithe man of medium height came impulsively up to her and introducing himself said , " You are Mrs. Stecher . My name is Fletcher . " " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this noise . " " Fletcher , " he said . " I 've been having a great time talking to your husband in the other room . He 's a wonderful fellow . We need men like that in this . . . " He leaned down and half-whispered to her , " They 're a lot of old fogies . He 's got brains . " " Who are you ? " said Gurlie , still not having heard the name right . " Fletcher , Fletcher . That 's my wife over there "  --  pointing to the shy , mumbling woman Gurlie had just met . " Where ? " said Gurlie . " There . " " So you have met my husband , " she concluded . " That 's good . " At this point , just as a stiff , graying man in an oldfashionedfull-dress suit was about to approach her , the tall host , standing below his portrait , banged the table near him with a gavel and brought the meeting to order . All corners of the room were filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was settling down for the evening . Fletcher was not so comfortable oR a rather fragile Louis XIV gilt replica . Some were high and some were low . Three of the ladies were together on a sofa ; Gurlie was in about the center of the room , comfortably placed , and Joe several chairs to the rear , inconspicuously backed into a corner . The business meeting was brief ; after the reading of thep193minutes , comically phrased , at which a few of the ladies tittered , there were the usual committee reports , the treasurer 's report . " Any unfinished business ? " Plenty , thought Joe . " Any new business ? " There was not a sound . Someone cleared his throat , but nothing came of it . " Well , " said the president , " is n't anybody going to say anything to give your presiding officer a reason for existing ? If not , ladies and gentlemen , before turning the meeting over to the entertainment committee . . . " " Oh Otto , sit down . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad taste . " " I 'd like , if I may , "  --  addressing his wife  --  " to say a word or two upon an important matter . Ladies and gentlemen , I must remind you that among our club members are many distinguished names , some of the oldest in the annals of our illustrious country  --  not that many of you have done anything to deserve it . " He paused . " On the other hand , there are those , like me perhaps , just off the boat , you might say , who represent  --  anincrement . . . " He paused again . What the devil 's he driving at ? thought Gurlie . Several of the ladies shot quick glances at her distinctly Scandinavian features , the turned-up nose , the blond hair , the heavy legs . . . " Ladies and gentlemen ... " " Oh , come off it , Otto , " Charlie Greer , the assessor with the gold tooth , prodded him . " Say what you have to say and give us a rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " fiercely whispered his upright wife to her neighbor . " Ladies and loafers , let me introduce to you a man who is making a name for himself in the business world and his charming wife , our guests of the evening , Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Stecher . " Gurlie grimaced and nodded several times . Joe 's expression did n't change . " And now with your permission , I 'll turn the meetingp194over to the entertainment committee . Mrs. Arents . It 's all yours , my dear . " His wife rose . She stood at the end of the room near the piano and , holding her chin high , facing resolutely forward , her thin figure erect , spoke in a low but distinct voice , diffidently announcing her program . " We will have first , " she said , " a song by a very lovely lady whom many of you know . " Then almost as an afterthought , she added , " Mrs. Clopp . " There was a little stir among the ladies , as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer , a pretty brunette in a white dress , who had appeared from an adjacent room  --  and she recognized the soprano from the church choir quartet . She had never before heard her name . " She is one of our high-school teachers , " went on Mrs. Arents , " and will sing as her first selection , In a Persian Garden . ' Putting on her pince-nez glasses , which she carried on a black ribbon about her neck , she went to the upright piano against the wall to her left , and began to arrange the music . She would accompanythe singer . As Mrs. Clopp arose to take her place before the piano the men sat up to have a better look at her , and the women , who were hardly of the type , on the average at least ten years older and far more plainly dressed , stared at her stonily . " Is n't she pretty ! " " White satin ! On a teacher 's salary ! I do n't know how she does it . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widow , you know . " " She 's very popular , I hear , vith some people . " The piano began the accompaniment . After a few bars the voice came in . It was not an operatic voice , but a creditableperformance by an attractive singer . The applause was instant and sincere , especially from the men . Mr. Fletcher continued to clap for a good twenty seconds after the others had ceased . " Bravo ! " he said , and smiled . His wife looked at him sharply.  |p195There  was a little consultation at the piano , a glancing at the new sheet of music that had been placed before the accompanist , then Mrs. Clopp graciously announced that her next song would be the well-known lyric , " Because . " " Urn , " said Gurlie , and nodded . There was great applause which the singer acknowledged with a smile . " Because . . . " she sang lustily . " Because God made the world . . . " Joe was embarrassed . He did n't like any show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made him sweat even to hear it ; he was glad not to be sitting toward the front . But he applauded along with the rest and that was that . He wished he were at home reading the evening paper . Mrs. Clopp sat down in her white dress beside Mrs. Mills , who told her she sang beautifully , and what a gift it was to be able to express yourself like that . Wonderful ! The general conversation broke out again and the singer was forgotten . " And now ! " said the host and president , coming to his feet once more , " after that delightful interlude , to return to the business of the evening . It was really beautiful ! Without further talk ( Charlie ) I give you Professor Grimes , who will introduce himself . Where has he gone to ? " A tall , bald-headed man , grinning from ear to ear , stuck his head comically in at a hall door from which , at once , he emerged dragging an easel on which he proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples , which he displayed before his audience . " Thank you , Mr. President . Ladies and gentlemen , let 's get on an informal basis before we go any further with the evening 's proceedings . In one word what I am going to do this evening is draw caricatures , of you , here , to show you how it 's done , to amuse you during the next half-hour . " A burst of subdued talking , back and forth , greeted this announcement . " Do n't laugh yet ! Maybe it 'll be you . Caricature is an ancient art , it is social criticism of the most acute sort  --  Hogarth , Daumier , there are many great names . Well , whop196will volunteer to sit for our first portrait ? Maybe we 'd better start with one of you gentlemen . What do you say ? You , sir , " pointing out Mr. Greer . The ladies obviously were relieved . By the time the professor had done the first two or three , with broad rapid strokes , the tension among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were having the time of their lives , especially as the professor knew his audience and was genial enough , witty enough , courteous enough to the ladies and had a good eye . He brought out many characteristicsamong his sitters that had never been noticed by any of them before . " We should have more meetings like this  --  what was it ? the brachycephalic head of Herr Arents and the long head , the dolichocephalic  --  was that right , Professor ? " " Yes , that 's quite right . You 're a good student . " "  --  the dolichocephalic head of Fletcher , here . No wonder you like Frenchies , Fletcher . You must be one yourself . " Refreshments were , as usual in this house , dominated by the delicate pastry which Mrs. Arents was so expert in preparing . The two servants , in tasteful gray uniforms and white caps , went about noiselessly . The men , gathered together again in the dining room , were smoking . " Why no . Is your husband here ? I have n't met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so : much from my husband about him . " " Wait a minute , " said Gurlie . " I 'll go get him . " So in she burst upon the men , who immediately got to their feet . " Why do n't you come in with the ladies ? " said Gurlie to them all . " Why do n't they come in hire with us ? " said Charlie Greer . Gurlie laughed . " I want you , " she said to her husband . " Why , you have n't met anybody . Come in , " she took him by the arm . But he shook her loose . " Come with me . " " Na , na , na , leave me alone . "  | " Leave him alone ! " said little Mr. Hammond , in his high treble voice . " I want him to meet the singer , " she lied . " Bring her in here , " said Charlie Greer . " I bet she 'd like a cigarette . Sit down . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in a minute , " said Joe . But Gurlie just stood there , so he carefully stubbed out his butt , taking his time , while she stood in the doorway . " Come back when you 're through , " said Mr. Fletcher , " and tell us the rest of it . " " All right , " said Joe . " What 's the matter with you ? " said Gurlie to him on their way across the room . " The ladies want to make your acquaintance . " So he had to talk to Mrs. Lincoln , to Mrs. Coates , to Mrs. This and That . It developed that most of the couples in the room were childless . Gurlie was an exception with her three children . Later some of the men came in and sat among the groups of women . Mr. Fletcher went to sit with the singer whom the other women had left quite alone to eat her ice cream and sip her coffee . " You have a lovely , sympathetic voice , " which was precisely what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I sing because I like it , " she said . " But I have no voice . I am new in Riverdale . This seems a very pleasant group . Have they been meeting for many years ? " " I 'm new here myself . But I understand that they 've been meeting for the past twenty years , at least . " She cast an appraising eye around . " Are these the best people in town ? " " Well , you could n't exactly call them the sporting set . " She laughed . When Gurlie and Joe arrived home , after midnight , they went immediately upstairs . She took off her dress , kicked off her shoes , undid her corset and threw herself flat on the bed . " Whoof ! Am I glad to get out of that ! "  | " Well , " said Joe as he began to loosen his tie and high collar , " I hope you 're satisfied . " " What do you mean by that ? " said Gurlie , sitting up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted it , now you 've had it . I hope you 're satisfied . " " Did n't you like them ? " But Joe had gone into the bathroom . Gurlie finished undressing , put on her nightgown and stood , when her husband came back into the room braiding her hair in its two short pigtails for the night . She was laughingto herself . " What a lot of old fogies , " she said . " So that 's the cream of the town . But I like them . I bet you can have fun with them when you get to know them . " " I hope I never see them again , " said Joe . " You will , " said his wife . " I bet you they 'll elect us members . " " God forbid , " said Joe . " Agh , " said his wife , " you have n't got anything to say about it . I had a good time . They seem like simple good people  --  but I do n't think more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists , the penniless brother of a wealthy publisher . The Millses , of course , have money , or she has . The Carvers . . . " " Yes , he was a nice fellow , " said Joe . " I like him . "  | " And now , " said Gurlie , the day after their introduction at the Literary Club , " we 've got to move to the other side of town . " " You mean if we do n't they wo n't take us in ? " " How could we entertain such people here ? " " Then we do n't move ! " said Joe . " Ha , ha ! " said Gurlie . " I saw a house , a beautiful little house , the other day . It was copied after the California bungalow style . It has windows on all sides to let in the sun . It is ... " " To let in the ice and snow , you mean . Na , na , none of that . What do we want with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " Right in the center of town , back of the woods . " " What woods ? " But that appealed to Joe . " And it 's cheap , " said Gurlie . " What you call cheap . " " It has a hot-water heating system , " said Gurlie . " I 'll bet the roof leaks . Is there a garden ? " There Gurlie was stumped . " No there 's no garden . And no chickens . A well-to-do Catholic family owned it . They are anxious to sell . There 's no other house in Riverdale like it . It 's very distinguished.  |p200Very  chic . I think I will begin to take French lessons as soon as we move in there  --  very few people here speak German . " " Do they speak French ? " " No , but a French class would be good for us . You can speak a little French . We ca n't have a full-size piano  --  the front room is too small  --  but we can have a good threequartersize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musician friends . " " What do they need ? Any dirty studio is all right for that gang . " " Crazy musicians ! " As little Paul called them . He was almostfive now , blond wavy hair , a sturdy young ruffian . So at last , to Gurlie 's immense satisfaction , they moved to the better part of town to a house , a little smaller than she wanted , but a charming house on a small lot , near the survivingpatch of chestnuts and oaks and beeches almost in the exact center of town . The whole interior was redone , wrought-iron chandeliers , quite an item , were installed , the walls were covered with grass cloth , the latest in kitchen fixtures and new bathroom equipmentput in , and along the entire front beyond the broad porch were planted white rhododendrons , small bushes , as Joe desired . " They 'll grow . " The rest was Gurlie 's . And there they began to live in the years just before the First World War . These were Gurlie 's best years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1917 , while little Paul was growing up . The house was the center of all the main musical excitement of the town . Lottie was the princess , a tall , ganglinggirl with big , dreamy eyes . She was passionately loved , from a distance , not without awe at her accomplishment , by a dozen young men of the environs . Those were the years when young women wore their hair high in the front on a framework known as a " rat , " volumi/nous skirts and frilled petticoats . The years when Flossie , definitely not musical , no rival for her glamorous sister , neverthelesshad her own admirers . Her straight legs , narrow hips , and high forehead were not unobserved . Having graduated from the nearby private academy , she was commuting daily to a school on Fifth Avenue across from the Goelet mansion and the Russell Sages ' , and next door to Anna Gould . Those were the years when you could have a maid for fifteen or sixteen dollars a month  --  a maid like Ellen Anderson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gurlie would pick them out at an agency in New York . Some starryeyedlittle Eva of some unpronounceable Finnish name , whose clear complexion matched her unruffled and serenely happy disposition . Not a syllable of English could Eva speak . Right from the boat . She had a brother in Jersey City and another sister , like herself in looks , out west on a sheep ranch . Two years after little Eva was with the Stechers , loved and instructed , the brother died , of pneumonia as far as the family could understand . She showed the family his photograph and they all cried  --  for days , until the sunlight of her eyes prevailed again . Once , after a big party at the house , served by little Eva , to the amazed astonishment of the men who were baffled by her peasant beauty and sunny smiles  --  a party that did not end till three in the morning , dishes piled mountain high at all vantages  --  Gurlie sank exhausted into a chair . There was a noise in the kitchen . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dishes . " " Not on your life ! Not that . Go to bed , " she told the little maid . " Go , I tell you . " But Eva started to cry and would not leave until Joe himself , whom she respected and feared , had to come out and order her weeping from the room . The house was small , and Joe liked small girls , not big , lumbering field hands . They made him uneasy waiting on thep202table . One , good as gold , and a wonderful worker , a Finn named Gerda , had acne . That especially annoyed Joe . " Get rid of her , " he told his wife . But Gurlie liked her and kept her . One Fourth of July , in the morning , the women of the house downstairs , dressing , or in the kitchen , Joe went up on the third floor to hang out the flag . A staff projected above the entrance to the front steps of the house from one of the windows of the maid 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall , downstairs . It was a big one . Holding it in his arms , he could n't see exactly where he was walking as he went up the stairs into the completelyunfamiliar room where the maid slept to open the window . Gerda 's bed had been drawn in front of it because of the hot nights . Holding the loosely folded flag , he pushed the iron bed aside with his knee to make room between it and the window for his maneuvers and squeezed into the space with the flag in his arms . As he did so , he stepped right into a chamber pot full of urine which soaked his foot and the floor . Joe was wild . A fastidious man , orderly , precise , disliking all slovenliness , he dropped the flag on the bed , turned and fairly bounced to the room below , looking for Gurlie , There he began in a furious voice , speaking in German , roaring at her to take that damned maid by the neck and throw her out the back door . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , began to laugh , still not knowing what had happened . Everyone was gathered about to listen . Then he told them  --  he had stepped into a pot full of piss . " Let me at that girl . Let me tell her . " But Gurlie would have none of it . " You 're not going out there in that state to talk to anybody . There 's nothing the matter with the girl . She probably did n't have time to empty it . You 're making a fool of yourself , " she said , as he raved on . " It 's your own fool fault . You had no business in her room at this time of the morning . . . "  | " The flag . . . " was all Joe could say . " You could have waited with the flag . What 's your hurry ? No , I will not let you talk to her . Go upstairs and change your shoes and socks . I 'll tend to the girl . " " I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move out , " Joe warned her . " The slut . " " Stop it ! " said Gurlie . " Do n't let your German temper go like that . You 're supposed to be an intelligent man . The poor girl , she 'll run out the back door if you go in there now . And what will the neighbors think of you then ? They 'll think you 're killing her . Do you want her to sue you ? " That cooled him down a little . " Agh ! " he said , looking down at his wet shoe . " Come here . Put your foot up , " said his wife to him . " Let me loosen the laces , since you 're so dainty that you ca n't even touch them yourself . " And Joe gladly put his small , graceful foot up on a piece of old newspaper Gurlie found for him , and his wife untied the laces . " Now go and change . " " These are my best . " " We 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on . Off with you . " . The girls crept into the dining room where Gurlie hadbeen finishing her breakfast when the storm burst on her . " What happened to Papa ? " Gurlie was chuckling to herself by that time . " Shh ! Do n't let him hear you . He stepped into a chamber pot in Gerda 's room when he went up to put out the flag . " " Well , that 's not so bad , " said Flossie . " No , but it was full . " " No ! Oh , my God ! And it went all over him ? " " All over his foot and the floor . I have n't been up yet to look at it . " " I think I can smell it , " said Flossie . " Of course , " said her sister . They all sat down on the chairs talking in whispers . " Does she know it ? "  | " Not yet , " said Gurlie . " She must be more careful . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up right away . " " The dirty pig , " said Lottie . " Never mind that , " said Gurlie . " You girls stay here in case your father comes back . I 'll go out and talk to her . Do n't say anything to make him angry . " But by this time Joe had come downstairs , taken his hat , and , slamming the front door after him , had gone out . " Good riddance , " said Gurlie . " He 's ridiculous . The poor girl . Gerda , " she said , " come here . I want to talk to you . " The poor girl , having heard the rumpus without understandingwhat was the trouble , came through the swinging door , her eyes wide , her acne-covered cheeks confronting them , stood there . " Yes , ma'am . What is it ? " Then Gurlie , the girls half-suppressing their amusement , told her what had occurred . " Oh my God ! " said the maid , and without waiting to be told , rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs at a run , disappeared above . Her face had gone white . " Come back here at once when you have cleaned up , " said Gurlie . " Are n't you going to fire her ? " said Lottie . It seems that in Finland , the disfigurement of acne , as here also , had been a great barrier to the girl 's social success . She had heard in the old country that if , when going to bed , you washed your face in urine every night , you could get rid of it . " Is it true ? " she had asked Gurlie and her daughters . At any rate , she had decided to try it . " No , " said Lottie , disgusted . Flossie immediately thought of those among her friends whom it might help . " I am very sorry , " said the poor maid , red in the face now from her weeping . " I know Mr. Stecher never liked me . It is because of my face . I am not pretty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . . . Shall I pack my things ? "  | " No , " said Gurlie who did n't feel like looking for a new maid at that time . " You 're staying right here . " " But what will Mr. Stecher say ? " " Do what I tell you . It was not your fault , but his , for being so clumsy . " The girl took Gurlie 's hand and kissed it . " But , " said Gurlie , " remember , no more of that kind of treatment . You understand ? " " Yes , ma'am . Thank you , ma'am . " And she looked at the two young ladies to see what they might think of her . " I am so sorry , " she said to them . " I am not dirty . I did it to try to cure myself . You must pardon me . " " It does n't seem to have done you much good , " said Lottie . " That 's cruel , " said her sister . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you at table ? I do n't . " " Shame on you , " said her mother . " She 's as clean as you are . "  |p206Ursula  Hendricks was not Flossie 's friend . She was sixteen , a year older than Floss , and united to the still older Lottie by their mutual interest in music . Lottie played , Ursula sang and sang , in a deep contralto voice for which she was receiving expensive lessons in New York , a voice that made everyone , especially Lottie , sit up startled when they heard her . But taste she had not . As you heard her you wondered at the songs she sang . It was all out of proportion . But sometimes in the winter when the weather was bad , and Lottie not available , Ursula , an only daughter in the twelve-room house , would say to Floss , " Stay with me tonight . Please stay . Call up your parents and say you 're stay-ing . " And that 's what Flossie would do . They 'd study their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school work . Supper was always a special treat ; simple-minded Mrs. Hendricks would see to that . Then they 'd go to Ursula 's room , a beautifully appointed chamber , twin beds of bird'seyemaple , closets with dozens of dresses , hats , boots by the score and . . . The telephone would ring and Ursula would be gone , leaving Flossie wondering while she waited , for an hour sometimes , after which the sallow-faced , dark-haired girl wouldp207come back exhausted and fling herself on the bed . Only to leap up as another boy would call and she 'd rush off again . Flossie would be doing her reading or her algebra or writing a theme , but how could this other girl do anything ? After a while she 'd get Flossie to help her . Furiously she skimmed the pages of her assigned work , never finishing , wearying of it before she started . Flossie , who admired her  --  she was a crackerjack on the school basketball team  --  could easily see why she never got anywhere . Oh , but  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hendricks with his goatee and quiet ways , poor Mrs. Hendricks , who threw her hands up in despair and could never deny her daughter anything , looked at Flossie over the supper table and shook her head despairingly . " Are you allowed to jump up from the table and talk to your mother that way ? " " No , " said Flossie simply . " I 'm so glad to have Ursula have good companions . So many of the girls that come here are good for nothing . And my foolish daughter follows them all . You must come often . Why do n't you stay here all during the week , you and your sister ? And Lottie is so musical ! I try my best . . . " " Oh , Mother , the girl is young , " her husband would say . " Do n't be so pessimistic . " Ursula would be out in the corridor , laughing and whisperingover the phone . " Oh , I suppose it 's one of those useless friends of hers . " Flossie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be embarrassed , look down at her plate and eat very quietly . Neither she nor her older sister were used to such carryings on . The big house , the obvious wealth , the good food and  --  what crazy things went on there that they would never dare to do at home  --  made them conscious of a whole world of which they had never been aware up to that time . And they liked it . Mr. Hendricks had some special skill or knowledge of the silk business in Passaic from which he made his money , butp208Floss never could understand how such a man could have married such a woman ; why even a child could see she was  --  well , ignorant . She could n't go out into society . She could n't talk . All she could do was cook . Flossie wondered how such an intelligent man , and so attractive , could have married such a thing , such a Hausfrau . Then , explaining nothing of the telephone conversation , the irresponsible Ursula , whom her mother adored , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Eat your supper , Ursa . You have n't tasted that lamb , it is very good . And your potatoes , eat at least a little . " " Oh , shut up ! " said the daughter . " I 'm sick of you . " Flossie flushed and looked down , expecting an outburst . But Mr. Hendricks would merely shake his head , while the poor woman looked at Flossie and seemed about to cry . " You see , you see . " And to her daughter : " What must your friend think of us  --  all ? " Ursula looked up then , contrite , and said , " I 'm sorry . " " That 's the least you could say to your mother , my dear , after such an outburst . " At that the daughter burst into tears and left the table . " Then why do you try to insult me ? " " I insult you ? " " I do n't mean that . But  --  you do n't understand anything . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and father , who tried to build up a little conversation about this , that and the other : " Are you in Ursula 's class in school ? " " I have some subjects with her , " said Flossie . " Well , that 's fine . Your sister is the one we see more often , she 's a remarkable pianist . I enjoy her playing . I like to hear good music and  --  I hope she will influence Ursula to like it , too . You can see what a spoiled child she is . I know she does n't mean the sort of thing she did tonight . She 's so impul-sive . " " Yes , " said Flossie.  | " Some boy or other , I suppose . Do you like the boys , Miss Stecher ? " Flossie was n't used to being called Miss Stecher . " Yes , I like the boys , " she answered . " But you do n't think of them all the time , as poor Ursula does . " Flossie wondered why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no good , if she goes on this way , " said her mother dolefully . " Oh , yes she will . All girls go through that stage when they 're sixteen , do n't you think so , Florence ? You do n't mind if I call you Florence , do you ? " " No , I do n't mind . " " What do you think ? " " I 'm only fifteen , " said Flossie . Mr. Hendricks laughed a loud , gusty laugh . " Good for you . Seek the protection of your age . Good for you . " Then Ursula returned . That night in their room , she said , " Oh , my mother 's so stupid , I could die . Could n't she see I was all upset ? Arthur  --  " Floss had heard of the boy  --  " just turned me down . I invited him to . . . " She had the most beautiful lingerie . Flossie admired and envied her it , all silk . Naturally , her father 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking of the boys . Well , what else is there to think of ? " " Are n't you going to graduate from school ? " " I want to get married . How else am I going to get away from this dump ? I ca n't stand it . " " Are n't you going to be a singer ? " " Agh , I suppose so . But there 's lots of time for that . I want a man . . . " Flossie did n't know exactly what she meant . " I want to be in love . I want someone to love me . I do n't want to keep on going to school . "  | " But you have so much . " " They can have it all . I do n't want any of it . I 'd give it up in a minute if . . . " The telephone rang again , as late as it was . Ursula rushed for the stairs , bounded down them in leaps  --  as if she had been chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bannister . " Hello , " she said , all out of breath . " Yes , darling . . . I knew , I knew . . . " And then Flossie closed the bedroom door so as not to hear and wished she had stayed home . " She must be crazy , " she thought . After a good twenty minutes  --  her parents had n't even come to their door  --  Ursula returned and sat on her bed , her hands hanging between her knees . Then she took up her pillow , hugged it and kissed it , lay down on her back with it in her arms . She seemed entirely to have forgotten her little guest . " Oh , I knew it , I knew it . . . Darling , " she turned to Flossie , " you must think I 'm an awful girl . I 'm not really , but I was so hurt . " You know I 'm going to have a big party the week before Christmas  --  you 're going to be invited  --  have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . And just . . . The only reason I 'm going to have it is  --  well , anyhow , it would have been spoiled for me  --  you do n't mind my being so frank ? " " No , " said Flossie , wishing she 'd put out the light and let her sleep . " Well , he told me he was n't coming . I felt terrible . I was crushed . I knew he was only doing it because of some of the others . I knew he did n't mean it , he was only doing it so it would make me unhappy , but . . . He just called me up to say he 'd be here . He loves me , he loves me ! " And so , taking off her dress , and her underwear , throwing them about the room , heedless of Flossie , who was n't used to such sloppy habits , she walked naked and indifferent to the closet , pulled out her gown of sheer gauze , and leaped intop211bed , switching off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighing deeply . Gone ! The night of the party was , just her luck , a beautiful one . There must have been forty or fifty boys and girls invited , anywhere from fifteen to eighteen years of age , from both Riverdale and Passaic  --  mostly from the private school Lottie and her sister , together with Ursula , attended . It was to be the biggest and best party of the whole Christmas season . Ursula of the dark , olive skin was the queen , glancing up with hardly a word to anyone as they came in and climbed the stairs to the girls ' or boys ' room on the second floor . " Hey , you look swell tonight . " " Thank you . " " Who are all these bums you 've invited ? Who are they ? " his back to the others newly arrived . " What kind of people do you let in , in this second-rate town ? " was the rejoinder . " You boys go upstairs toward the back . You 'll see the room . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hi , Ursa ! " " Hi , Roland . " A blond , curly-headed youth , rather short , cherubic , with laughing eyes of blue walked in following the others . " So you came ! " " Of course . You do n't suppose I was going to let those rotters get ahead of me ? Do you ? Where is everybody ? " For the moment , though a few were standing in the middle of the room with their backs turned , the sound of shouts and laughter showed that most of the guests were still upstairs . The boy looked quickly right and left , and then , going boldly up to the dark girl in the yellow dress , tried to kiss her on the mouth . She turned her head aside so that he missed , hitting her on the temple instead . He laughed and went toward the stairs as she clutched his sleeve  --  but he broke away and left her.  |p212Others  were coming . She wondered if they had seen . First a tall girl  --  the door had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I-Iow are you , darling ? " Behind the newcomerwas a lad even taller than his sister , who had preceded him , who simpered slightly and , without unbending , formally shook his hostess by the hand . His hair was brushed smoothly back from a high forehead . " How are you ? " he said . Ursula seemed not to hear him . He shrugged his shoulders and slowly followed the others upstairs . They were coming down now , meeting the late-comers going up . " Darling ! What a pretty dress ! " They crowded on the stairs , pink , green , blue and white  --  organdies and chiffons with ruffles to hide their budding breasts , their thighs encased in petticoats , only the bare arms permitted to reveal the charms otherwise unacknowledged . The sexes , at this age , were only beginning to be differentiated , they could be rough with each other , asked and gave no quarter . One of the Riverdale gang grabbed a flower a lively little girl was holding in her hand . " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed the tail of his coat as he attempted to duck around a corner and almost pulled it off his shoulders . They had jostled the tall girl who thereupon , seeing what was going on , grabbed the flower out of the boy 's hand and gave it to her sister  --  who tried to smooth it out , then seeing it had been broken in the struggle , she threw it violently into the boy 's face . " You clown ! Just what I 'd expect from a person like you , " and she turned her back on him . " Wo n't you all sit down at the tables sit anywhere , but pick yourselves partners  --  four to a table . " " May I sit at your table ? " said the tall boy with the high forehead . " I suppose so , " said his hostess . " Or would you rather have someone else ? " " Oh , no . We 're going to play five hundred . " " Oh , Ursa , I thought you were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a group about the piano thumbingthrough a foot-high pile of popular songs . " Gee ! What a collection ! You 've got everything . " From that time on , the overheated house rocked with the strident voices of the card players , winning and losing . Each table became a center of youthful banter  --  the girls in general siding against the boys . " I do n't see what she sees in him . " " His people have money . " " So have her people . If she ever marries him , she 'll regretit . " " You 're just jealous . " " On account of him ? Poo . That runt with his tight littleblond curls , he 's not even a good athlete , and he certainly isn'tbright . Oh , I suppose his father will take him into his office . " " I understand he does n't want to go in with his father . " " He does n't even want to go to college . All he wants todo is marry a rich girl and spend her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't see either of them . " " I 'll bet you . . . " " She has n't any shame . " " Oh , there they are ! " " He 's no good . " " No worse than she is herself . They 're in love ! Love . " " They 're just kids , leave them alone . But I hate to see her get mixed up with a boy like that . My brother does n't like him . " The talk and the clatter , alternating with periods of almostcomplete silence when the hands were being played , had been going on for the better part of an hour when suddenly there occurred a sound toward the back of the house , as if some heavy object had fallen . Everybody heard it , and turned to look as Ursula came flying through the kitchen door , completelyabsorbed in what she was doing , turned and held it closed . As she realized what a noise she had made and thatp214everyone was looking at her , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond boy , the resistance of the door gone , burst into the room and almost fell flat . His face was flushed , his tie awry . Seeing all eyes on him , he cast a quick glance at Ursula and , taking a comb from his breast pocket , began to smooth back his hair . " Battle ! " yelled someone . " I hope she gave it to you good , " shouted another of the boys . Ursula had begun to sing " Egypt , " her favorite song of the moment , as the play at the tables abruptly ended and some of the boys and girls gathered around the singer . " What happened ? " they asked each other . " I did n't even see them go out . That fresh guy . She asked for it , I suppose . " " But where was her mother ? " " Where do you suppose she was ? In the kitchen . " " What was he trying to do to you , Ursa ? What were you up to , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly did , " said the girl , breaking off her singing . " Who wins the prize ? Will you gather the cards , Wilbur ? " The tall boy with the high forehead started at the sound of his name , but dutifully began to gather the cards , summed them up and announced the winner of the expensive gold cuff links and locket , in each case , boy and girl . " Oh , Ursa , they 're lovely . Thanks . " " What shall we do now ? Will you boys clear the tables away ? Just fold them and push them out in the hall . " " Sing for us , Ursula . " " I will , if you 'll join in the choruses . " So she began to pull out of the pile of music anything they asked for . The only one they knew well was " In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree , " which , off-key , the boys roared after her . " Come on , sing it again . " Those who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's an awful fool . It 's all right making out it was something he did , but you bet she was the one started it . All she is interested in is a man  --  but when she gets into trouble . . . You 'll see . She has no brains . " " Did you see his face ? " " Some day she 'll regret it . " " I like her . Why must we always put a bad interpretation on what goes on ? " " Because he 's no good and she knows it . Would you want to go out with him ? You know what they say about him ? I understand he drinks a lot . He flunked out of high school . He 's positively stupid . " " What 's that I hear ? " said Fred Hoyt , coming up . " You bunch of cats . " " I think so too , " said Lottie . " Leave them alone , they were only having a little fun in the back corridor . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " " No , I have n't , " said Lottie . " Well then how come you know so much about it ? Come on , Lottie , let 's go back there and see what it 's like . Wan na ? " " Fresh . Not with you . That 's sure . " " Oh you would n't . " " Let 's play Wink , " someone called out . " Naw , not that sissy game . " " Well , I 'm tired of sitting down . And I 'm tired of singing . Get a platter . Let 's play Spin the Platter . What say ? " So a heavy metal platter was procured . " Be careful of it , " Mrs. Hendricks cautioned the boys . " I do n't want it dented . " " No , ma'am , you can count on us . Here y'are , " said the perpetual clown , coming into the room again , so pushing back the chairs , " Here y'are , ladies and gentlemen , " and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So they began to spin the platter , calling out a name as they began , a girl rushing out to pick up the spinning disc before it should lose its impetus and fall inert.  | " What 'll the forfeit be if you miss ? " " You 've got to kiss the one who called your name . " " Oh , do n't let 's begin that ! " " Yes , " insisted Fred Hoyt . " If you do n't want to play , you can sit down on the sidelines . Come on , let 's go . I 'll spin it first . Ursula , " said he , and gave the platter a vigorous spin . Ursa , although seeming indifferent enough , darted out like a flash and had the dish in her hands before anyone could catch his breath . " Wilbur ! " she called out and set the platter in motion . The tall boy got up quietly and with apparent indifference caught the plate still spinning . He stood there glancing around , then leaning far over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Flossie , who had been a keen observer of what the older girls and boys were doing , was so startled that she almost missed the spin . She picked one of the more obscure boys , more her own age , for her turn . And then they all began to cheat  --  not to give it much of a spin , hoping to get someone to miss . " Oh , that is n't fair ! " Then some of them tripped and fell over in a wild attempt to retrieve the falling disc . Someone kicked it back into the arena ; when someone else tried to catch it , it flew out of his hands . Someone else batted it , when  --  crash ! the big chandelier in the middle of the room was hit and a shower of glass rained down on the heads of the players . " Now look what you 've done , " said one of the girls . Mrs. Hendricks , hearing the crash , hastened into the room , poor soul . Everyone was sorry . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron around his waist , a broom and a dust pan in his hands . There was glass everywhere . " There 's a piece , Ursa , " said the poor woman . " There 's another piece ! " she said again and again , all absorbed . " Ursa , there 's a piece . Look , Ursa , there 's another piece . " But Ursa was n't listening . She had detected a movement at the door as , taking advantage of the excitement , Roland had slipped out the front door and gone home.  | " Who 's that ? " said Gurlie . Flossie looked out , standing well back in the room so as not to be seen . " I do n't know . An older woman . All in black . She looks like a caller . " Gurlie , blinking her eyes , came to the window just as the woman was mounting the front steps . " Oh , that 's Mrs. Moore . I 'd given her up entirely . I wonder what she wants . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of you will have to run down and get me some . " At that moment the front door bell rang . Eva , the maid , came out of the kitchen , but Mrs. Stecher waved her back . " I 'll go . " Flossie disappeared upstairs . " Why my dear , I could n't find you . Where have you hidden yourself ? " " If it is n't my old friend , Mrs. Moore . Come in . I 'm glad to see you . " And Gurlie put one arm about the woman 's shoulders and gave her an affectionate hug . " What are you doing here ? " " Oh , I thought I just had to come north to see my old friends in Riverdale . My ! Have n't we got a ' fine house ! How long have you been living here ? " " About a year . Take off your things . You must be tired . How is your son ? "  | " Edward 's away at college , and I 'm so lonesome without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love your house . " " Do n't you want to take off your wraps ? " " Oh , let me rest a moment first . Thank you . I 've walked all over this blessed town . I 'm so tired . " " Flossie ! " called out her mother . " Yes , Mother . I 'm dressing . " " Well , as soon as you 're through , come here a moment . " " All right . " " I 'm so anxious to see her . She has always been one of my favorites . The girls nowadays ! I would n't give you a penny for them . But your two daughters still have some respect for their elders . It 's the upbringing that counts . There are so few people fit to have children nowadays . It 's wonderful to sit down . " This was the first time that Mrs. Moore , Mrs. Edward Moore of Shady Springs , Maryland , had seen Gurlie since Gurlie 's return from Europe , and Mrs. Moore was just a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emorys . " Oh , I am so glad to see you . Please tell me all about your trip . What an opportunity ! That 's one of the disadvantages of being so poor . It 's terrible  --  terrible , my dear . You are so lucky . I have n't heard a word of the Emorys since you 've been back . I wonder what became of them ? " " That 's what . . . " began Gurlie . " I saw them several times while you were away , keeping track of them for you . " She laughed . " They were so happy to be in your house taking care of your sweet husband . To tell you the truth , you just about saved their lives . They were stony broke . And your husband , your husband ! He was an angel . A veritable angel . I do n't know what they would have done without him . Did they leave everything all right ? Clean and . . . " " Clean , " said Gurlie . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top219you . They come from the nicest people , the very best people in Maryland . " Another laugh . " For years they had their place right near ours , oh for a hundred years or more . What am I talking about ? Two hundred years . On Smith Creek . When you come down to visit me this fall  --  you know you promised !  --  I 'll take you all over that part of the country . It 's a beautiful state , Maryland , especially in the fall of the year . An aristocraticregion , with beautifully rolling hills and green valleys . I do want you to see it . Because you know that I 'm married again . " " You ? " " Yes , I 'm married again . What could I do ? George did n't leave me anything . He went through everything before he died , his last illness and all that . Your husband was so good to him . He always said , That man Stecher is one of the few instinctive gentlemen in this town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . But you have n't told me a thing about your trip . I 'm afraid I talk too much . " Another laugh . " Oh , there 's your sweet young daughter . Darling ! How she 's grown ! Why , she 's almost a woman . Look at her , look at her legs . Come here , darling . You 've become a very attractive girl , you know . She really has . " " Just a skinny thing like her sister . " " Oh you should n't talk like that about your own children . I wish I had a daughter . That 's the way it goes with the old families . They 're all dying out . Soon there wo n't be a living one of us . Oh I want you to see the South before it is finally gone . Why do n't you bring your daughter with you when you come to see me in the fall ? She 'll have a wonderful time . " " She 'll be at school . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " said Flossie . " We have friends who have a stable . It would be so nice at that time of year , while your mother and I are gossiping , visiting the Grange and meeting my friends , for the youngp220people  --  there are a few nice boys left  --  to be riding out around the country . You 'll enjoy them and they 'll enjoy you . They 'll love entertaining a Yankee . " Again the laugh . " They 're so gallant . But you must n't expect them to marry you . " " Mother , " broke in Floss . " I 'm going downtown . Is there anything else you want ? " " Your mother and I . . . " " No . And come right back . " " Oh , is n't she sweet . How I talk ! Did you really have a good trip ? " " Who did you marry ? " said Gurlie . " Oh an old man , an old family friend  --  William Garvan . But he needs me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me his home . A widower  --  we 've been friends all our lives . Still living in the old house . A lovely old place , a little out of repair , but he has money enough and we can have a life economically together  --  inour old age . What can a woman do ? I 'm very lucky . You will come and visit us , wo n't you ? " Of course , people here do n't have the same feeling that we have about our forebears , ancestry is everything to us . You hear a lot about the first families of Virginia , the FFV 's , as they call them , but Maryland ! Well , there 's the Carters , and the  --  well , I wo n't bore you , there are only a few of the real bluebloods left . The Moores are among them . " Gurlie was becoming restive . " The recent immigrants are hardly of the same breed . We were all English and Scotch of the purest blood . The aristocratic tradition . And we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose . Of course the Nordics are our own blood . " " They 're broke , most of them , " said Gurlie laughing , as in her mind she remembered one evening , at the Greers , a group of them were being bored by this same Mrs. Moore and her boastings about her ancestry , her talk of " recent emigres , " the riff-raff of Europe , the servant-girl type , when Charlie had interrupted her . " Listen , Margaret , " he had said . ( She was an old friendp221of his wife 's . ) " I would n't boast about my ancestry if I were you . My people came over on the Mayflower the same as yours . A lot of them had good blood in their veins , good English blood . But they were mostly younger sons the family wanted to get rid of . That 's why they sent them over here . Or indentured servants . Or thieves or adventurers , petty tradesmen at the best . Just the ordinary run of the farm . They did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came here hoping to make a fortune . That 's what your famous first families were , land hogs . They got a little bit ahead of their neighbors and that 's all there was to it . " " Come on , let me show you the house , " said Gurlie . " And then we 'll have tea . " " But you 'll promise to come stay with me ? " said Mrs. Moore at the end of the afternoon . " I 'd so enjoy it . " " I 'd be very glad to , " said Gurlie . " When ? " " This fall . In October  --  if my husband will let me go . I 've always wanted to see the South  --  where the aristocracy of America lives , there and in New England , of course . " " Oh you must n't expect too much . We 're poor . Very few of us boast fine houses today . Two of my cousins , the sweetest old ladies you 'd ever want to see , last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving . Literally , they did n't have enough to eat . " " What did they do ? " said Gurlie . " It 's terrible . They started a little business . They 're wonderfulcooks  --  like all Southerners . They had a family recipe for pralines . . . " " Pralines , what 's that ? " said Gurlie . " Oh a kind of candy , made with pecans . They made pounds of it . They 're tall , dignified old ladies but they had to do something . They could n't ask for charity . So they put up two orange crates with a board between them , right at the side of the road , and took turns selling what they had made . Right at the edge of the road . It was a very brave thing to do.  |p222You  know the automobiles we have nowadays ? They did a good business selling pralines to the automobilists that passed . " " I should think so . Good for them . " " Well , we 're not all so badly off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were so good to my friends , I 'd like to show you how we live . " And in October , when persimmons were beginning to ripen , Gurlie arrived in the little market center of Shady Springs . " Why it looks just about the same as around New Jersey when you get back from the main roads , " she said . The trees were in full process of shedding their leaves . Mrs. Moore 's son , Edward , had driven their old car to the station . Gurlie got in and they headed over the rolling country , past fenced-in fields where colts and mares were grazing . " This is wonderful , " said Gurlie . " I agree with you , it 's a very beautiful country . It makes me think of Norway when I was a child , on one of the biggest farms in southern Norway . You can breathe in the country . I love it . " " Oh , I 'm so glad , " said her hostess , doubtfully . The farm was about a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , the last quarter of the way on a dirt road , with high banks on either side . Gurlie saw two or three poor farmhousessetting back in the fall foliage among the tumble-down barns and other small buildings . Then they came to a board fence that had been painted white many years before and a gate that was jammed open leading to a curving carriageway among yellow pines and walnut trees from which the leaves had already fallen . " And here we are ! " said her hostess . There was no lawn , just ragged grass about a house standingamong the half-bare trees  --  a medium-size house , to which a wing had been added at one time in the form of an L. It badly needed a coat of paint . A wide porch raised about a foot up from the ground completed the picture.  |p223It  looked neglected , surrounded by the old trees . But it was inviting and Gurlie liked it  --  she could see the barnyard in the rear , there was a well house  --  and what undoubtedly used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they entered the house it smelled as all old houses smell , of rotting wood and a wood fire . That was the South of it , thought Gurlie . When Mr. Garvan came heavily forward to greet the newcomer , Gurlie saw a big man , in a comfortable , loose-fitting suit , his hair white , his manner gracious and reserved . He offered Gurlie a big , soft hand , and with a distinct Southern accent said , " I 'm glad to welcome you . Come in and make yourself at home . " Everything in the place was old , and that night when Gurlie went to bed , that was old too , a big walnut bedstead with a high ornamental back board . The mattress sagged in the middle . Gurlie threw out two of the pillows and tried to sleep . There was no heat in the room . She could not sleep . Off somewhere across the valley she could hear a baying of hounds . Yap , yap , yap , yap . One dog was leading the others , loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four voices , followed by an interval of silence . Once she thought she heard a man 's voice commandingthe dogs . Gurlie got up , went to the long window and looked away to the west into the darkness , down a hill over the tops of some trees  --  at least a mile off , it seemed , to where a light mist lay close to the ground . The barking of the dogs settled down now to a slower pace , a steady yap , yap , yap of the leader with only occasional salvos from the others and  --  yes , she saw a light , probably a lantern , faintly , now and then moving in the trees . The barking continued  --  growing fainter as she stood there looking off into the night . There was a moon  --  must be  --  shining somewhere . She could n't see it . The distance seemed infinite and unpopulated . She grew cold in her flimsy nightgown , standing there in her bare feet , so that she wentp224back to bed . She could still hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled sleep . At breakfast the next morning they had fat back and griddle cakes . They were waited on by a young barefooted colored girl , daughter of one of the old servants , Mrs. Garvan said , who used to be attached to the house . The quaint silverware intrigued Gurlie , teaspoons worn almost to a knife 's edge , the curve of the neck strongly marked . She took one of them up and examined it . " You have beautiful things , " she said to her hostess . The old man had eaten earlier and gone out . " Yes , and you should see what there is in the closets up-stairs ! " " I should think some antique dealer would give you a fortune  --  for the old painting alone . " " He wo n't hear of it . No more will I. " They went for a little stroll about the premises after breakfast and Gurlie had an opportunity to taste the persimmonsof which she had heard . " What was all that racket I heard last night ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The dogs barking . " She had dreamed of runaway slaves hiding in the swamp and bloodhounds . " Oh , I suppose it was some of the young bloods from hereabouts on a coon hunt with their dogs . " " A coon hunt ? " " Yes , there 's lots of raccoons around here . The dogs tree them and then the men chop the tree down and the dogs finish them . " Some time before she fell asleep Gurlie had thought she heard a chopping , axes striking regularly into the wood . " Today we 'll give you a rest because tomorrow when the Grange meets you 're to be the guest of honor . I hope you brought that paper you have written , I heard it was good . All about Norway . " " What paper ? I did n't bring any paper . "  | " My dear woman ! Why I told you they wanted to hear . . . " " But you did n't tell me . That 's almost a year ago . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , I told you . " " That does n't make any difference , " said Gurlie , laughing . " I can remember everything that 's in it . I 'll talk to them . " " A few of my close friends will be in to tea this afternoon and then you can see what they 're like . Good . I 'm glad you 're going to talk . They 'd be so disappointed otherwise . They 've been waiting for it ever since I told them at the last meeting . " " Ladies and fellow Grangers , " Mrs. Moore , that is , Mrs. Garvan , began , " I 'm glad to see so many of you here , in our little old meeting place here today , because I 've got a treat for you . " " Yes , naked , stark naked , " Mrs. Pinkney was finishing her story to her cousin , Mrs. Mouton , at the back of the room . " Just a young girl . Raleigh , yes . Her father is a surgeon there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the house . I think his father and the doctor had gone to school together . . . " " And so without ado , I 'll ask Mrs. Joseph Stecher , my dearest friend from Riverdale , in the Garden State of New Jersey , to tell something of those famous people  --  the Vikings , of whom she is a proud daughter . Oh and by the way . . . " " . . . a Northerner , from Massachusetts . Oh , a boy of about eighteen . A nice enough person of a good family . She walked right into his room , during the night , sometime , naked as the palm of your hand , and got into the bed with him . What are we coming to ? " Gurlie was a little confused . She could talk , when she got started . But with all those Southern eyes looking her over  --  she could feel them , almost hear them talking about her , tak/ing her apart . And all of a sudden her blood began to boil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had seemed inoffensiveenough , the little she had seen of them . But their talk of cousin this and cousin that , their strange intonations , the pretension which was not really pretension . . . " . . . for the whole week he was there . " " But did n't she . . . ? " " Of course . That 's how I came to hear of it . She did n't even ask him to marry her . She had to go to her father . Oh , she 's all right now . But did you ever hear of anything to beat it ? And he , of course , got off scot free . " Gurlie thought to herself , Now I have my chance and I 'm going to tell them the truth . Who do they think they are ? There had been a little polite applause when she stood up  --  and then she opened her mouth , and out came the foreign accent  --  they were waiting for that . There was an audible movement throughout the room as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I came to this wonderful country only twenty-five years ago  --  after my father lost his business . I was born on a big farm , south of Oslo . There were dozens of servants and farmers . We were well-to-do . Our family was one of the oldest in Norway . I can trace my ancestryfive hundred years to the Vikings , to the time of Hamlet . " There it was . She had let the cat out of the bag . " . . . Raleigh , or perhaps it was Roanoke . No , he did n't tell me , did n't tell my son Sherwin the name of the doctor . Believe him ? Why it was from the lips of my own son . He 's such a sweet boy . He tells me everything , to his little old mother , just the same as when he was a child  --  his roommate at Harvard . Can you believe it ? Harvard ! This summer , yes . Every word of it  --  we 're so close . He was puzzled . Wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You must not think , " Gurlie was saying , " that because they can not talk English that they are ignorant  --  or stupid . They come from very good families . They are poor , that is true , as I was when I came here , but that did not mean that Ip227was a servant-girl . I had to work . I had to do all kinds of things that I was not used to , to earn my living . But I was proud , I can tell you . I had a good education and I could work , too . And I did work . I did all kinds of things . " Your ancestors were immigrants , too , and many of them were poor . They had to work . Just like today , some of them were good for nothings . Some of them were even of the criminalclass , and some of the worst sometimes seemed to have the best luck . Many of our financiers who are successful in business today came from the lowest classes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the world want to put everyone else down . Ha ha ! That is the kind that want to marry their daughters into the English aristocracy . Some Irish immigrant who made a lot of money in the beef business becomes my Lady This or my Lady That . " You will see ! My Eva Anderson , who came to me three years ago , is a fine , healthy girl . Now she can speak English . She got married to a farmer in Minnesota , pretty soon her children will be the leading citizens , maybe doctors and lawyersand then you 'll see . They have brains . " But that is what America is for . That is why we come here , because there is liberty for all . We should recognize that . We can not afford to be so proud . Because we all come from the same place and we have the same blood . The English and the Norwegians are from the same blood . The Norwegians are a pure race . When the first settlers from England came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long before this country was ever discovered . So when we come here today , we bring something to this country that you should be glad to get . We do n't have to bow down to any-body. "  |p228Flossie  looked , made her choice and that was the end of it . She did n't expect to get her wish , she seldom did ; her sister was the prima donna with a dozen young blades ( and some older ones ) flocking about her , not she . The one she had seen , in a flash , was among them . He paid no attention to her . And that was her secret and she kept it . Whether it was a good thing or not never occurred to her . Meanwhile , she was popular with a slightly younger set , and her days were anything but dull . There were three Englishmen , born in England , who had been living in Riverdale for many years and were now middleaged . They were all interested in the stage . It was through Lottie , the pianist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the accepted circle of the local club world , perhaps from their own wishes as English , holding themselves apart , they were slightly suspect on moral grounds among their fellow townspeople . Most prominent was S. T. Holmes , an accomplished musician , who unhappily had only recently lost the apple of his eye , a boy of sixteen who on a two-week camping trip with friends his own age had contracted appendicitis , kept his bellyachesecret , and , too late , had been operated on and died . The boy was a promising pianist in whom all the dreams of the old man 's youth seemed about to flower.  |p229He  was crushed . All that was left was music , music itself . He was an agnostic , he 'd quit all church affiliations , and many thought he had received only his just due in the loss of the child . The Episcopal minister refused to say the conventional service over the boy 's body . Holmes was bitterly resentful . Some sort of compromise was effected , but the man was only confirmed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time out he cut loose from all conventional behavior ( so the town felt ) and plunged instead into the organization of a group of the younger people of Riverdale who wanted to produce Gilbert and Sullivan 's operas as a first venture . Lottie associated herself with the group as one of the pianists . There was no orchestra available . The second of the three Englishmen was Bishop  --  not at all musical  --  also rather an outsider in the town , both from his absence from it often on long business trips to Europe and South America , but also from the fact that his wife , a foreigner , was unwilling or unable to find any close friends about her ; rather she kept a secret and soul-consuming longing for Paris ! Paris ! where part of her education as a girl had been gained . She was not antagonistic to the town but felt ill at ease in it and consequently was virtually unknown in it . Bishop had two sons , both among Lottie 's admirers . The third Englishman was a brilliant , if submerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when he appeared in little skits at the Royal Arcanum benefit performances . Now at last , as Sir Joseph Porter , K.C.B. , in Pinafore , he was perfectly cast for the first time , and his small but accurately tuned voice and cultured British accent made him a great favorite . He looked and acted the part . Without Percy Sykes there could have been no show . Thus they had an impresario in Holmes , an accomplished stage manager in Bishop , and an actor par excellence in Sykes , about whom the young people of the town clustered with tremendousenthusiasm , giving themselves , their time and their not inconsiderable talents without stint.  |p230The  group , during the months of rehearsal , by ones or twos , was often seen at the Stechers ' . But Lottie 's admirers were not limited to these . And as the years went by and Pinafore had been sung and applauded , and the company , augmented and better trained , had gone on to the Mikado and become well known one to the other , they finally began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time considerably ripened . Holmes was the ageing hero . The movies had begun to appear at the small local theater ; " Our Own , " as the group was called , was doomed . And Holmes , abetted by those who knew and admired him , began to look toward Hollywood . The First World War had not even entered the minds of the people of Riverdale . Scandal was still the best topic of conversation , and there had been time during the past three years of the opera company for it to accumulate . Bishop and Sykes were exempt . But Holmes , with his passion for the human voice and his emotional dependence upon his singers , felt strange stirrings . The proximity of the young actors to each other , the consequent breakdown of inhibitions , the late hours , the borrowed atmosphere in this little suburb of the dreams of the great capitals of the world , induced in them ideas of love . Rumors spread . Love and music ! And if Lottie did n't combine them in her own person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having lost their prime objective in his darling son , who else could know them ? She was just the age . Everyone loved the dark Lottie . And she was gracious to all , indefatigable  --  you could n't tire her out or abash her . She seemed to rise superior to all those about her , not because she was beautiful  --  she was too tall , and a little stooped , she was not voluptuous in figure  --  but she had a dreamy mystery about her that , while it frightened some , put her on a pedestal for others . She was not frivolous , a man felt that at the first approach ; she was not facile , even a little awkward , but youp231could n't take liberties with her . She seemed older than other girls of her age . But to be near her made you breathe a little faster ; to want not to touch her  --  that you could n't do !  --  but to lose yourself in her completely . You hardly knew what you wanted . And while you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would do , that perhaps you were the chosen one . Now ! But somehow you held back . She made you feel inferior , less than the dust . Which one of the dozen men who surrounded her would get her ? She was so kind to all . A man named Russel , an ex-football star , strong as an ox , a natural athlete , but a good deal of a boor , who was really not of the fascinated group about her , once met her on the way to the railroad station and asked her if she would n't prefer to drive with him to the city . He had an open sports car , a novelty in those days . The old plank road across the meadows was not meant for automobiles . It was cobbled and narrow with car tracks down one side . Russel thought he 'd give the tall girl a thrill . And he did . He opened the throttle and at one point was making seventy miles an hour , which in those days was something . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat with one hand and onto the side of the seat with the other , expecting to land in the ditch at any moment . She stared fixedly ahead as they passed a horse-drawn cart ahead of them as if it were backing up . The narrow river bridge was ahead . As they rushed upon it Russel gradually slowed down to a more reasonable speed . Then he turned and grinned at Lottie , saying , " How do you like it ? " " Is that as fast as you can go ? " she replied . That was how she took men down . Before her , the older men , her willing slaves , merely looked and asked her to play . And she was always willing . You could n't tell what were her thoughts . What was it ? Once she had gone canoeing with one of the Bishop boys on the upper Hackensack . The out tide wasp232strong , and they had to paddle hard to get through a raceway under the bridge at Milford . Overhead on the little bridge was a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocketing tide . Leaning on the rail , at ease , he was right above them as they started creeping through , the expression on his face one of interested detachment , waiting to see if they 'd make it . Lottie looked up and winked at him . That was the kind of girl she was . What did she want ? At the piano she was queen . Perhaps the very feeling of frustration she induced in her suitors came from that . She was really , at that time , such an accomplished pianist and there was such a mystery about her as she played her Schumann , her Debussy , her Chopin , that they were overawed . They simply did not dare . Sometimes of an evening , in the new house ( there was a sitting room upstairs from which Flossie listened ) Lottie , the wonderful Lottie , would be entertaining a group of her friends , a man or two , some singer from the opera company , and someonewould ask her to play . Then the room would quiet down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would begin . The kaleidoscopic dreams that possessed the minds , as well as bodies , to the very toe tips , of those young men , and perhaps the girls as well at such times , left them limp at the end . And after a decent pause , Henry Baker , the baritone of the company , who was pathologically self-belittling , would say , " Well , there 's nothing to do after that , I suppose , but to go out and shoot myself . " " Why ? " Lottie would say , turning to face the room on her piano stool . " Do n't be ridiculous . Here , I 'll play something else to liven you up . " And she 'd go into a Chopin polonaise because she could play anything from Bach to Grieg with complete ease , though few wanted her favorite , Bach . But they knew that Bach was her music and that she played it when she was alone . That increased the legend of her profundity , the reputation for the catholicity of her tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The otherp233girls also adored her , especially Leona , of the beautiful sopranovoice , who was her nearest friend . They did not invite the usual chit-chat of ordinary conversation when she was present . Yet there 's always a clown ready to step in where the serious man hangs back  --  but Lottie could handle him , too . He never could get to the point . He 'd come all alone sometimesand , with his barber-shop tenor , try ineffectually to sing to her accompaniment . She would play the willing martyr . " I want to try these songs over , Lottie . Have you ever heard them ? They 're beautiful . The Indian Love Lyrics . ' " Oh my God , she would say to herself ! Have I ever heard of them ! As a matter of fact for a year or more , every young man with or without a voice who was eligible to call on her at one time or another had asked her to accompany him as he bleated those vulgarly passionate words . She 'd pound away , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands I loved " . . . There was an insistent violinist , somewhat older than the local boys , and with a strong Scandinavian accent , who was wild to marry Lottie and made no bones about the proposal , coming again and again to the point . He even pleaded with Gurlie and , to a lesser extent , with Joe to join him in persuadingthe girl to accept him . " I love her , " he said , " and I will make a good home for her . It is so reasonable . I with my violin and she with her piano . We can have such happy and profitable times together . We can have the same musical friends . It will be an ideal marriage . " " He wants an accompanist , that 's all , " Lottie would say . " Let him hire one . No , I know his kind . A wife would be cheaper . " In spite of her European parentage , Lottie did not want that . She was an American ; she could see through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men that want to sing their sentimentalsongs to you know about true music ? What do they know ? What do Americans know ? " the violinist would ask.  | " They know more than you think , " Lottie would defend them . " Some of them have fine voices , Henry Baker , for in-stance . " " He sings like a cow . Poh ! Poh ! Poh ! He has no feeling . The Americans do n't know what it is all about . They are superficial . They have no deep , no philosophic understanding of what it means , to the soul . They have not read Schopenhauer . They have not suffered . Love to them is . . . " But Lottie only laughed . He tried to embrace her . To kiss her . " Leave me alone , " she said . " You dirty thing . " " That is the end ! " He was furious . And muttering to himself that she would regret it , he sarcastically wished her infinitehappiness with some boring businessman of a husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all they want is money . They make fools of their stupid men , and what do they give ? Nothing . Their minds are like ice cream . . . " That made him laugh , well satisfied with himself . He was alreadybeginning to feel that he had almost made a fool of himself . " American women are like ice cream , " he said . That 's wonderful . How nearly he had been caught ! His violin packed carefully away , he lifted a smiling face to this young girl and bowing sharply took her hand and kissed it . " Good-bye . " Lottie could n't imagine what had happened to him . He was gracious , smiling . The perfect gentleman . " Miss Charlotte , I am persona non grata to you , I am forced to see that . I hope that I have not been boorish . You will forgive me ? I will not bother you again . " Lottie was bewildered but firm . " I will go upstairs , if I may , to say good-bye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality . " " Ma , " Lottie called out at the foot of the stairs . " Can we come up ? " Joe , who was in his shirt sleeves , looked at his wife . " Sit still , " she said . " Sure , come on . " So Mr. Grueher came up , made his formal apologies and , taking his violin under his arm , bowed once more at the doorp235and left forever . Lottie sat in a rocking chair and fanned herself . " Thank God that 's over . " There were also the Bishop brothers . Both were in college and during the active years of Lottie 's popularity , could see her only during vacation periods or during the long summers . They both were entranced by her playing . They were both at the parties given from time to time at the Stechers ' during the Christmas vacations when there would be a crowd , and Flossie , the younger sister , would be helping in the background , serving the refreshments  --  Lottie was always too busy -- or looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brothers would call up and appear alone . Fred , especially , would bring his music and sing . " Gott ! " Herr Stecher would say to the world in general , " there it goes again . " Less than the dust ! Fred did n't have much of a voice but , as with the others , the words of the " Indian Love Lyrics " spoke to exquisite perfectionwhat he longed to say  --  he felt indeed less than the dust before this enigmatic and accomplished young woman 's chariot wheels . He was entered at that time in a national competition which would decide his fate  --  in architecture , at which he was an accomplished student . He looked at Lottie with serious eyes . His brother , Charlie , who sang only in the ensembles , was an intern without money in a New York hospital ; neitherof the Bishop boys had a cent , a major deterrent to anythought of marriage . But Charlie had been observing Lottieclosely for a year . He looked at her forehead , which was broad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hair , hershapely nose , her flat chest  --  surely she 'd win no prize in abeauty contest  --  her lanky thighs as she sat at the piano , allowinghim to see her without being observed ; her skinny legs ; her large , mysterious eyes . Surely she was no beauty , but he had to acknowledge that she was disturbing , to say the least . He talked with her . In no way did she resemble herp236mother , that fierce determination to ascend the social anthill , that turned-up nose , clear blue eyes . Lottie had brown eyes . Where did she get them ? Joe 's eyes were even bluer than his wife 's . Some throwback . To Joe 's brothers ? Perhaps to the violinist who had remained in Europe , a teacher at the conservatoryin Prague . If anything , she was her father 's daughter , though she was tall and her father short . But she was too like him or his family for her own good . He looked at her and seemed to read her thoughts . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's glances . What she thought was none of his or any man 's business . They talked , Lottie and Charles . Slowly he got to know her and she him . He was studying her carefully . For one thing she was horribly superstitious , believed in nothing . At the first clap of a thunderstorm she 'd fly for a closet and stay in it till the danger was over . Bishop himself had been terrified at thunder and lightning when he was a child and did not hold it against her  --  but smiled . " You 're a big girl now , " he told her , when she confessed her terror . " Suppose you do get killed ? What of it ? " " No , no , no , no ! " she said , hiding her face in her hands . " You do n't believe in an after-life , you say . " " No . But I want to live now . I want to find out a lot of things that I do n't know yet , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to die , yet . " " A complete hedonist , eh ? " " I do n't know what that is , but if it has anything to do with enjoying yourself , I 'd like to be a great artist . I want to be admired , I want success  --  I 've never even been in love . That 's something , is n't it ? Everybody says it is . I 'd like . . . " There was a blinding flash followed by a splintering crash of thunder . " Ow ! " shrieked Lottie , and dove into a corner by the couch , a pillow over her head . After a moment she looked out cautiously , quite ashamed . " Where did that hit ? " " It was pretty close , " he laughed . " I guess you thought the devil had you that time . "  | " Do you think it 'll do it again ? " " No . It 's gone now . You 'll live . " She seemed a child at such times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirers had a real voice . That was Henry Baker , the baritone of the opera company , with whom she practiced his roles . That gave him an advantageover the others , but he was a morose fellow , terribly unsure of himself , with the sad eyes of a bloodhound , as gentle as they and with as deep a voice . He was inarticulate , submerged , never daring to think of himself as a successful lover . Henry could laugh at himself with the same jaundiced eye as he could look at all others . He was lonely , an expert fly fisherman , but he could sing . As Lottie was an inch or so taller than he and , always alert , she had him beaten before , in his slow way , he could get to speak seriously of anything . She kept the room brightly lighted and always had another numberto suggest when he wanted to rest from his singing . He , like the others , would sing the " Indian Love Lyrics "  --  like a frustrated bull . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper upstairs , would announce . " Pale hands I lovedBeside the Shalimar . . . " Krieger was another big fellow from out of town , a successfulbusinessman , hail fellow well met , a fair tenor voice and a bag full of practical jokes . He was fairly popular with Joe and Gurlie , and had visited the family the summer before when they had been at a small cottage in Orange County , New York . But Lottie could n't stand him . He was too crude . She was n't to be rushed off her feet that way . And then , among the others , there was the last , who seemed to be the favorite . Lottie thought so too , or so it seemed to her . When he would call , a different atmosphere pervaded the house than with any of the others  --  a sadness , a gentle mood that seemed as of someone listening.  |p238Elmer  Fawcett was from one of the most cultured and best thought of families in Riverdale and one of the oldest . Both his father and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aristocratic air all about them . And Elmer loved music . He was much at home at the Stechers ' , but seemed always sad . For the truth was he had a bad heart , and had to be careful , especially going up and down stairs . Lottie was sorry for him , her sad eyes showing her deep sympathy for one whom death had addressed gently , saying , I may some day have to call upon you . Enjoy what you can , my dear boy . But do n't expect too much . The young man knew his possible fate . He had never beforebeen in love . To be young , to live , to know one 's self doomed . It was a hard fate . Sometimes Charlie Bishop would read her his poems , bitterly , defiantly , in a harsh voice . " Why do you write like that ? " she would ask him , puzzled . " Your first little book was beautiful . " " It stank , " he said bitterly . " I was a fool ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't , " said Lottie . " I loved it . " " It just shows your ignorance . " " And you wrote me such a nice sentiment in it . " He ground his teeth . " But these things , you are making fun of yourself . I do n't think a poem , to be a poem , should use ugly words , dirty words , vulgar . . . A poem should be beautiful . And you can write beautifully . But you seem to want to spoil everything . Why is that ? " He would laugh to himself sardonically and change the subject . " I do n't understand you , " she would say . One night Elmer was very low . He 'd gone to the doctor , who had been frank with him , told him he 'd have to give up his studies and , in fact , all thought of an active life . " Your condition is serious . "  | " How long will I live ? " the young man had asked . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , it 's not as bad as that . " " You mean it is as bad as that . Do n't you ? " " Anything can happen . But you had better go away , for a month . Then we can tell . " " Oh , do n't believe him , " said Lottie , when he spoke of it . " If you do n't overdo , you can live a long time . I betcha . Do n't you want to sing ? " " Not tonight . " Then with his head in his hands there was a long pause . Lottie watched him . He looked up , right into her eyes without a word  --  but she could feel the tears coming as she too sat there in the dim light , at the piano , with her hands folded in her lap . A thrill went up her spine , her thighs felt stiff as she became aware of the seriousness of the moment . They looked at each other for a long minute ; then he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the way it shook him how his heart was beating . She thought his lips looked blue . " It 's been wonderful to have known you , Charlotte . You know , of course , that I love you . I 've never been in love before . It 's a wonderful experience . It 's hard for me to have to give you up . " Now she was indeed crying  --  from happiness , from sorrow  --  shemade no attempt to define . His entire sentimental nature was moved and if , at the back of her head , she felt a strange relief , she could not have told you the cause . " Why do you talk like that ? " she said . " Darling , may I call you that ? " She nodded her head dumbly , but did n't move . " It 's wonderful to call you that ! My darling . . . My own . " Now she was sobbing openly . " What a world of happiness . . . Look , Charlotte , " he braced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wo n't propose to you , you might accept me . And that I do n't want . I love you with every ounce of strength I have in me . But my dear , I 'm a sick man.  |p240I  wo n't live long and I 'm not going to ask you to be my nurse . I know what happiness is . Now I 'm going home . " " Oh , no . " " Oh , yes . And I 'm going to go to bed . The old doc wanted me to go to bed today , but I had to come here first . Now he can have me and if  --  if after the next six weeks are over . . . " He coughed and straightened himself . " No . I 'm crazy . I 'm a sick man , " he said , fiercely , " a hopelessly sick man . Good-bye , Charlotte . It 's been wonderful knowing you . Say good-bye to your parents . I 'm going home to die . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think it 's as serious as you say . " " All right . " " Pale hands I loved . . . " " Oh , my God , " said Joe , upstairs . " Here we go again . " He went to Bermuda and came back at the end of a month wonderfully relieved , so much so that he gave a party one night to celebrate his recovery , and the next morning was found dead in bed.  |p241Those  were the days ! By dint of her native energy , her drive , popularity and Joe 's continuing business success Gurlie had arrived at the top of the heap . You heard her name whereverthe social affairs of the town were discussed . Everyone knew her , and she knew everyone . Her house , largely because of Lottie 's abilities , was the musical center of the town . Joe , an astute politician , when he wanted to exercise his talent , was her one stumbling block . If he had been willing to give in to her , she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them that has your head , she would alternately taunt and coax him . She wanted him to go into county politics . But he said no , and he said it so vehemently that even Gurlie had finally to leave him alone . All politicians are crooks was his positive and unshakable conviction . Sometimes one of the girls would bring home an Evening Journal for the feature story , some lurid and improbable love tangle illustrated with pale color prints of a seminaked female on a divan with a drooling and blank-eyed lover leaning over her . On the front page would be the three-inch headlines in black and red playing up the usual Hearst pattern . If by chance Joe saw it a veritable hell would break loose . " Have n't I told you never to bring that dirty sheet into this house ? " And you knew what he implied by " sheet . " Ifp242there were a fire in the grate , he 'd tear the paper up and throw it in . Whoever was responsible would run into her room and close the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If we ever have serious trouble in this country , that sort of yellow journalism will be at the base of it . " The World was the only paper fit to read . Gurlie had induced him to join the German Liederkranz , though not as a singing member , or even an active participant in its social activities of any sort . They did , however , go to its annual or semiannual concerts and would sometimes take guests . One year the girls had invited the Bishop brothers for a New Year 's supper and dance . Champagne was king ; no other wine was served . It was wild . One pompous male across the table from the Stecher party , a big fellow with a varicoloredribbon across his chest , was making himself objectionable . At midnight , when confetti and serpentines were being thrown and disorder was rife , one of the young men rolled up a wad of bread into a solid dough pellet and hit the offensive Heinie a whack in the cheek . He went crazy , spotting one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the table to face them , they stared him down . Gurlie , besides , became a member of the executive committeeof the Scandinavian-American club . In those days there was great excitement over the race for discovery of the North and South Poles . Stecher , for some reason , distrusting Peary 's pompous assertiveness , backed Dr. Cook and his claims to have been the first at the North Pole , and only after the revelationof the falsity of his claims to having scaled Mt . McKinleydid Joe give up his belief in him . But Roald Amundsen had been a schoolmate of Gurlie 's brothers in Sarpsborg , and when he had been successful at the South Pole , her exultation knew no bounds . Fremstad , also , making her debut at the Metropolitan Opera , Olive Fremstad , whom she had known as a child , confirmed her in her good opinion of herself . And when the tall and lean Amundsen one night stalked onto the stage at Carnegie Hall for a lecture on his exploits , sponsoredp243by the Scandinavian American Society , Gurlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Peary . He stood on the stage , a pointer such as a schoolteacher uses in his hand . A committee walked out to him and presented him with a gold medal similar to the one Peary had received from the National Geographic Society with which he , Amundsen , had no patience . As the chairman was making his speech , the great man stood impatientlybut obediently waiting . Immediately thereafter , the medal in its case in his hand , the audience expectant before him , he looked up and said , " I thank you for dis niise medal . " And , walking to the wings , put the medal , in its case , down on the floor . Then , going back to the center of the stage and taking up his pointer , he called out in a tremendous voice to the men in charge of the controls at the back of the auditorium , " Switch off die lights ! " The audience roared with laughter . After which he gave an account , with stereopticon views , of his experience aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was entertained later at a formal supper at the **25;6310;TOOLONG , with great gaiety . But in the middle of it he made his excuses and , giant as he was , following a beautiful young American matron whose queenly appearance and manifest pride at carrying off the hero of the occasion was apparent , he strode from the room , his long legs fairly twitchingwith half-suppressed excitement and agility . The Scandinavianswere incensed . He seemed to be shaking himself free from their parochial implications . " He 's become too good for us . " Gurlie did n't like it . " Some American floozie , " she said . " Men are fools to a pretty face . " Everybody laughed . " He belongs on a ship . " So Gurlie entertained herself and advanced her prestige . The Fletchers , of the Fortnightly Reading Club , became the Stechers ' closest pals . It was a turnabout arrangement . Andrew Fletcher was to his own family what Gurlie was to the Stecher menage . He was the gay , though calculating , inciter ,  |p244in  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And his wife , Elizabeth , with her little , twitching nose through which , whenever she was nervous , she sniffed vigorously while she cleared her throat with a little nervous cough , was the unwillingfoil . Joe , in his way , was only dragged against his will out of the house nights . " Fortnightly tonight , " Gurlie would announcetoward seven o'clock every two weeks when he 'd be looking forward to a nice , quiet evening at home . " God damn it ! God damn it to hell ! Why do n't you leave me alone ? " But she would have already laid out his dress clothes , his stiff shirt , and he would have to get into them . He 'd be fit to be tied as he struggled with his studs and black bow tie and made the air fairly blue with his curses . The girls would hear him and snigger  --  but he would go . Perhaps his backing of Dr. Cook as the true discoverer of the North Pole was merely the unconscious protest he was registering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind would bring up all kinds of arguments to support the adventurer 's claims . It was something to say , something to stir up the resentmentsof his associates , whom he secretly despised . " Those fools , " he 'd laugh to himself . But he 'd lend money on occasion to an impecunious artist , one of the club members , and talk , when he had to , pleasantly enough . Gurlie and Andrew Fletcher , who was very successful in his ribbon business , which took him often abroad , became the active leading spirits among the younger members of the club . Stecher , while in no way the counterpart of Liz , and for very different reasons , merely followed their leads . The acquisition of personal property and an intense rivalry became a game between the friends , mounting hotter and hotter for those climactic years before the fateful outbreak of the First World War . As Gurlie thought back to her ancient lineage , now broken , she felt herself predestined to re-establish it . To win , to acquire possessions was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have the stability of her ancestral home . She would found it for the family , forever , and it should be called Alverheim ! All this was still cloudy in her spirit  --  you ca n't call it her mind , for , in a way , she had no mind , she had only a blind drive , inarticulate but dominant , which gave her the impetus to despise her own brothers and sisters who were willing to accept a subordinate social status . She broke with them , as she broke with her own mother , who attempted to subdue her . But she liked Andrew Fletcher , him she could understand . He had the same impulses as she did  --  but he could n't patronizeher , nor she him . So the rivalry was let loose . At Christmas and birthdays the two families began by giving each other modest presents . At the next occasion each would cap the other 's gift with something more expensive . Neither would allow the other to put him down . And if Liz had a new dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next meeting of the club . Until on one such occasion Gurlie appearedwith a magnificent diamond ring . Lizzie , within a month , came up with a lavaliere featuring a diamond of notableproportions . Not that Gurlie wished to make a vulgar show ; that was too easy . But diamonds , aside from the opal , her birthstone , were the sole jewels she cared to possess . And by the end of that winter Joe , who was happy to give his wife whatever she desired , came up with a diamond necklace and pendant with a stone so beautiful that , upon her broad breast , it shone like a sun in the sky . Whatever it was that Liz next acquired , perhaps the large house into which she had moved , or the new car  --  Joe would not have a car  --  Gurlie next bewildered her club members , some of whom , the remnants of the old literary set , were poor as church mice , with a crescent , worn in her hair and set with diamonds of graduated sizes , twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal . But for all that , though one or the other would be chal/lenged and annoyed by turns , the families remained good friends even when , at a later date , on the occasion of the marriage of the Fletchers ' older daughter , Gurlie , with Joe 's consent , presented them with a huge grandfather 's clock to their total surprise and dismay . The meetings of the Fortnightly Reading Club became gayer now than they had ever before been , and the music , which was always an essential part of the program , much better in quality . Violinists and vocalists of Lottie 's acquaintancewere often heard , and Lottie herself became the favorite with all the members . They felt very lucky and even the Arentses , who were regular operagoers during the season and thoroughly sophisticated music lovers , had to acknowledge that at her best the accomplished Charlotte was well worth listening to . But Gurlie was a devil  --  aside from all this . Her high spirits prodded her to all sorts of pranks . One Halloween she grabbed her elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and outlandish hats and went to sit in the office of one of their club members , a very staid physician , whom they knew well . Gurlie had never forgotten her early days , when , on arrival in the United States , she had had a job for a while in Macy 's basement . Her experiences there with the then ubiquitous Irish immigrant never left her mind . Being a perfect monkey , she had learned their lingo in jig time and when she wanted could make herself sound as if she was no more than weeks from the " auld sod . " This time , when the doctor looked out into his waiting room , he was completely taken in . " I want for you to look at me daughter ? I think she 's a little weak in the chest , " said Gurlie to the good man . " Well , bring her in . " And so it went with Gurlie jabberingaway at a great rate until the doctor became annoyed with her interruptions . But when the two women began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Mrs. Stecher ! " he cried out . " And Charlotte ! " he could scarcely believe his eyes andp247had to call his wife to see . They laughed together , hardly able to control their amazement . " We 're going to the Fletchers ' now , " Gurlie told them . " Let me use your phone . I want to ask first if Mary is at home . " Mary was the Fletchers ' Irish maid , a heavy woman who had been long with the family . " I 'm looking for a woman named Mary Foley , " said Gurlie , when she got Andrew Fletcher on the phone . " Does she live with you ? " " Yes , " said Fletcher doubtfully , " but she 's not in now . " " Well , I 'm her mother 's only sister , fresh over from the other side , and I 'm coming to see her . " " But I tell you . . . " Gurlie had hung up and was already giggling at Fletcher 's probable state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lottie , whom she had enjoined not so much as to open her mouth , in tow , Fletcher tried to turn her away at the door , but she insisted and finally got in . And there she gave them a good story , how she had come out from the city an old woman , hoping to see her niece  --  she was poor and . . . Fletcher could sense a touch , and completely forgetting that it was Halloween , became fussed . Lizzie was nervously keeping in the background , half-frightened at the woman 's importunity . " Why does n't he put her out ! " she kept saying to herself . " She 's an obvious impostor . " " Do you mind if I sit down and rest meself a while ? " said Gurlie . " Maybe me niece has gone to mass and 'll be back soon . I do n't want to go back that long way without seeing her . " At last Fletcher got rid of them , crowding them to the door until they were out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Gurlie admonished him , " Tell Mary that Mrs. O'Toole called ! " The two women called next at the Bishops ' , three houses below . But there after talking for a while unrecognized both to Bishop and his son , the medical student , she could n't refrainfrom telling them who they were and what had happenedp248at the Fletchers ' . Everyone laughed his head off at the way she had shown up their neighbor . So Gurlie had her witnesses and for weeks afterward the joke was at her rivals ' expense . " I never saw anybody so mean , " she taunted them . " You could see I was an old woman in distress and you never even so much as offered us a drink . Shame on you ! What do you think of that ? " she 'd say to those about her . " They did n't even ask us to sit down . " Gurlie in fact , demoralized the whole club . Once at a musicale , serious and successful , she distributed to each membera toy , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpet or bell , " And now , " she said , after her always deliciousand profuse refreshments had been served and consumed at the end of the evening , " we are going to put that classical stuff in its proper place . Take the souvenirs that have been distributed to you and at the sign I shall give you , fall in while my daughter plays the accompaniment . " The noise was deafening . The Millses , the most staid of the club 's members , the idols of Mrs. Covell , who made a living as the lady 's companion and the one responsible for her cultured sobriety  --  Mrs. Mills especially  --  howled with delight . It had never been dared to do such things in the club before . To the frowns of some of the others Lottie kept poundingout the tune , da da to da , da ! until all were exhausted.  |p249When  little Paul was nine years old he was a beautiful child ; his scowl was magnificent . His matted poll of wavy blond hair , his long , straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gurlie to dress him in neatly ironed shirts and suits for which he showed the same disrespect that his father did for dress togs . He was a good kid too , and though no teacher 's pet at school , did well enough in his work . He was not loud , but unassuming , and loved at times to be alone , to go into the patch of woodland bordering to the rear on the Stecher property . As young as he was , he once , with a homemade figure-four trap , came in with a sixteen-poundopossum which he had caught and killed there . Never in the history of the locality had anyone even seen such an animal in the vicinity . Often Gurlie would put on the gloves with him , kneeling on the rug before him , and let him slug her as hard as he might . She 'd battle back , breaking all the rules of the game , to his disgust , pinning his arms to his side with a bear hug from which he 'd struggle to escape until she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss . He 'd fight loose , give her one final bat from which she 'd protect herself with her arms in front of her face , take off his gloves and refuse to go on  --  until the next time . Joe never could do that . That he wasp250proud of the boy would be to put it mildly , but he had no way of showing it . Every summer there were days when the house was closed and the family would go away either to the mountains or the seashore . At first , before Einar went to live there permanently , the old farm in Vermont had been the chosen place . It was perfect for the growing children . But it was inconvenient for Joe and as the years passed Gurlie would have nothing of it . It was , besides , too poor for her ; she would not put up with her mother 's domination , and she was through with that oldworldatmosphere and her sisters ' simple habits . She had visions , bred of Joe 's increasing achievements in the business world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwater . Not that there had not been the time when they had gone all together , little Paul and all , on a day-long trip up Haystack , the local mountain peak , old Charlie plodding along to its foot , where Einar would unbridle him , take him out of the shafts and tie him under a tree for a long rest . Then up the path they 'd go , Auntie Olga along with the rest , laboriouslyclimbing the woodsy path to the spring . That was the halfway point where Auntie was left with the lunch baskets while the rest of the party would , after a breather , go on to the summit . Even now they 'd often speak of it : the day clear , the view on all sides unobstructed until the eye lost itself in the distant mists and obstructing peaks in the distance all the way to Monadnock . The last part of the way had been precipitous , the rocks sharp , the steps over the projecting shoulder high and slippery  --  and then to arrive ! Here we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubs , the fruit small and hard , wind-bent scrub pines , the branches all to the south and east , distorted and broken . Your lungs felt clean and you struggled pleasantly with your breath . " I 'll be a wreck tomorrow ! " Gurlie would say . And , " Du du ! " to the little boy . " Look at you ! You 're a moun/taineer . Look at him ! Is n't he wonderful to climb all those rocks ? " Everyone admired the little fellow . The young ladies , though their boots were quite improper for the rugged terrain , seemed to enjoy it as much as the others . They had one or two scares over turned ankles . " Do you remember , " said Hilda as they arrived at the top and sat down a little out of the wind to rest a moment  --  it was really cold at the top  --  " do you remember the first time we came up here how little you were ? Just little girls . " " Yes , " said Flossie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costumes for us . " " I remember that , yes . It was for Old Home Week . I think I still have those costumes at home . " " Yes , they were pretty . We sat in the big carriage . " " In the surrey , yes . " " And we were in costume , like Norwegian peasants . And you tied four little flags , two Norwegian and two American , to the four corners of the carriage . Then , with us sitting up front , we drove in the parade . Did n't we have fun ? " " Yes , those were happy days when we were all together . " And so the young people explored the spiny bushes , found a few harebells in a sheltered corner . " Oh , look ! " Lottie called out . " Look how delicate they are . I wonder what their name is . " Nobody knew . Little hanging bells with ferny leaves . A half-frightened or subdued bird with a red head kept a rotten tree trunk between himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , because they heard him tap tap tap with his beak . And so , reluctantly , they turned their backs on the scene and began to descend , quite different from the climb and no less difficult , down to Olga and the spring again . There on the beautiful green grass the fat auntie had laid everything out and , as they came up , flushed and ravenously hungry , was in the act of shooing away a bothersome yellow jacket which was attacking the food.  |p252But  those days were long past now and did not interest Gurlie . " You can go if you want to , " she told her daughters . " I 'll stay home . " She was glad to get rid of them . First after that she tried the seashore . " Let 's take a cottage ! " the girls shouted , when what they 'd do for the summer was being discussed , thinking of the freedom , the sea , the light and , in their bathing suits , to find companions  --  to find adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resort , a barren and wild stretch of sand on the outer coastline near Westerly , Rhode Island . They had even induced Joe , whose sole use for the out of doors was a mountain stream with trout to go with it , to go with them . Weakfish washed in by a storm tide and stranded on the beach gave the Finnish girl , wide-eyed at the bounty , a chance to show her prowess to select and pickle them . That was all that the shore meant to him . And pickled mussels . But for the rest , he stood it for a few days and then , " Sahara ! " he said , and went home , taking one of the girls with him to keep house for him on alternate weeks while he went back to the office . Already Gurlie was looking about for something else , some place , nearer home perhaps , because , after all , Joe could be troublesome and obstinate . She decided to go once more to the sea to please the girls and because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norwegians have , mountains , yes , as fine as any in Switzerland or the Harz Mountains which recalled to him Joe 's boyhood in Silesia , but in addition for a Norwegian , there were the fjords ! And that meant the sea ! All the way from the Lofoten Islands down past Oslo , the sea which enlarged the soul . In spite of Joe she 'd go to Westerly one more year . The girls had their companions there  --  had they not been looking at the snapshots all winter ?  --  and even Inga , the maid , wanted to go back . Joe could make the best of his " Sahara desert " for one more season . Little Paul longed to play in the sand . Even Joe , for the short time he 'd spend there , enjoyed the seafood ,  |p253and  the girls could alternate taking care of him at home a week or two as formerly . It was agreed . But that was no answer . Joe had heard rumors of a region in lower New York State , in Sullivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my God , " said Lottie , when she first heard of it . " Are you going to stick us up there ? " But the fishing was superb , on the upper waters of the Delaware  --  and they knew that some day . . . " Oh , they could at least try it . " " You mean a boarding house ? " " Why not ? Other people have a good time there . " " But Father , I 'd rather . . . " " That 'll do . " " Then we sha n't go anywhere . " So Gurlie knew that sooner or later , now that Vermont was abandoned  --  Joe refused to have anything to do with the New Jersey beaches  --  Gurlie knew that something in the back country within perhaps about fifty miles of New York City would finally be the place they would choose . Her objective was still a farm , though she had no idea what the upkeep of a farm would mean in this country . She was thinking in terms of Norway fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dreams . But one day , she was absolutely determined about this , she would find such a place , with a stream and a romantic forest . There she would have cattle  --  cattle are always so picturesque grazing about on the hills on a fine day ; besides , she was practical . If you do n't have cattle , where are you going to get the manure for your fields and garden  --  and fruit trees ? You must have cattle , a herd to begin with of at least twelve head . You can sell the milk which would help to keep them and grow their fodder right on the place . There 'd be pigs , too , and chickens for fresh eggs . Gurlie sighed to think of it . Joe , too , got it a little into his blood . He loved to hunt . A partridge or two , a few pheasants  --  they were getting fairly plentiful in New York State in recent years.  |p254He  'd have the place posted , of course . And rabbits . He wanted little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made Joe think of his own boyhood , though he 'd had little opportunity to shoot ; his father had been a forester on one of the big estates . He was a good shot . But the small boys were not allowed to handle a gun and , by the time they might have followed the father 's profession , he was dead and gone . Joe 's mother was also dead . There had been nothing left and the other sons had been forced to go into the army  --  there was the Franco-Prussian war in the offing . . . But Joe , a printer , had been commissioned by a publishing house to come to this country and start them off in the color-lithography skills . Little Paul would have to go through nothing of that . At last Gurlie could begin to see her way ahead now for several years . There , when she finally found the right place , she would build a solid stone mansion as the seat where her blood should establish itself in America . There is no better place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little Paul might even become a farmer . He should get to know animals . They would keep a dog , a real dog , not like that little trollop they now had . What a dirty little thing she was , that little Skye terrier . She bit people when they came to call . Why only yesterday , when Charlie Bishop came to see Lottie , the little bitch had seized him by the pants leg and ripped his trousers . In spite of everything they could say she would n't let go . Of course she had pups , that was the reason . You ca n't blame a female if she has pups ; she is defending them . What a little slut ! The girls giggled at her and often were amused . They found Gurlie laughing at the window one day . " Look at that scandalous little thing ! What is she doing ? " Somehow the animal had taken her one little female offspringout on the front terrace to give it an airing , when up came a dog , interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! Not at all . She took her little bitch of a puppy and with her own nose rolled it over on its back for the big dog to smell it all over.  | " What do you think of that ? " Gurlie howled . " Did you see what she did , with her own little daughter ? Gave her to any dog that comes along to teach her what to do . " " Oh , Mother , " Lottie had objected . " Hurry up , go on out and bring them both in . Disgrace-ful . " But on the farm they 'd have big dogs . And these scrawny girls of hers  --  " Why do n't you eat ? Girls in Norway are not skinny and fiat-chested the way you are . Look at you . " Flossie 's legs were well-shaped enough , but Lottie 's were like bean stalks . Gurlie for years thought of the farm , or , rather , the estate she would found . Joe smiled and let her dream . This was still five years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring had produced the Pirates of Penzance , in which Flossie had appeared with the rest of the young ladies , that part of them that could put up with the questionable morals of the group  --  Flossie had appeared in an interpolated number with others of the chorus in lace nightgowns . It was at that time , seeing her on the street walking away from him one day that Charlie Bishop had first noticed her straight and well-rounded legs . Love was in the air . Old man Holmes of the opera companyfelt it when the contralto , Mrs. M. , would let go in one of her arias . Ursula Hendricks had been engaged for the part , and with her distinguished voice had practiced with the group a few times . But either she had forgotten the role and had to begin it all over again wherever she did appear or , simply , she would not show up . And finally , to her annoyance , she was dropped . Mrs. M. , rather out of the fashionable set in town , had taken her place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once she had begun to sing , first Mr. Holmes and then everyone in the company began to prick up their ears . There was something dark , unknown about Mrs. M. Her husband , a teller in one of the local banks , who had been , innocently , of course , but none the less seriously , involved in thep256disappearance of a packet of large-denomination paper money , seldom or never called for her after the evening practice sessions . It gave her an air of irresponsibility . Someone usually accompanied her home afterward , sometimes it was Mr. Holmes or his son  --  or whoever it might be . " Good night , my child , you sing divinely . " " Good night . " " Is your husband home ? " " Yes , he had to go to a bank meeting tonight . He must be in bed asleep long ago . " He 's a nice fellow . " " Yes , he 's a nice fellow . Good night . " And she 'd be gone . How do such things get noised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lottie , but she was not one to ask questions . As she sat patient at her piano while Holmes would be trying over a certain passage which the chorus was rehearsing for the twentieth time , she 'd look around at the faces of the singers , at the soprano , at little Gannon , the tenor , and at Mrs. M. , and try to guess what they were thinking . It offered wonderful opportunities , these rehearsals , for any two to get away together wrapped about in an atmosphere of music . How really beneficent such a person as Mr. Holmes really was to give his time , his energy to afford everyone so much pleasure . She 'd sit there and half-guess what was going on . Why does n't something like that ever happen to me ? she would think ; she who never , until that time , had known a kiss full on the lips . Never ! She wondered what it would be like to have a lover . It was in the air . From one and another it moved through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buoyed up by the interchanges of musical sequences until they began to wonder if perhaps they too might not themselves dare , as how many have dared before them , to enjoy ! Lottie , sweating there at the piano , weary from sitting , hearing the tiresome repetitiousnessof the rehearsals  --  envying Mrs. M. her voice . Oh to have a voice like that ! Poor thing , I would n't blame herp257for anything she did , Lottie would find herself confessing . " I hope she does . " " Does what ? " She started awake . Mr. Holmes had been speaking to her several times . " What ? What did you say ? " " In love , Lottie ? " someone called out . " Oh no , " Mr. Holmes would chaff her , " not Charlotte . She 's just a dreamer . She was way off . " And she would smile her enigmatic smile . " When she falls in love , " Mr. Holmes , who took all sorts of liberties , would say , " she 'll fall heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was competing for a prize in architecture , the Prix de Rome itself , and it looked as though he would get it . His father , his strange but talented mother and his brother , the young intern and poet , were all rooting for him to make good . It was early spring , the world was on its way to the greatest triumphs for peace and for plenty it had ever known . All a young man needed was to get his start , to marry , perhaps  --  and paradise , as near an earthly paradise as one could wish for , would be opened to him . Fred believed that , too . He had determined , if he won the Prix de Rome , that there was only one thing that would complete his happiness and that would be to have a woman like Charlotte Stecher to share it , if she would . Why not ask her ? The only drawback : his brother . They had discussed Lottietogether , close companions as they had been all their lives , and though neither had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each sensed that the other , admiring this girl so openly , was a rival . Each suspected the other of perhaps deeper motives than he showed . Holy and pure , as their naturesdemanded their thoughts to be , buoyed aloft on wings of song , nevertheless they were practical enough to find themselves on the brink of action . Love was in the air . Mr. Bishop had said , and his wife to , had seconded it , that if Fred won the Prix de Rome he 'd sendp258the older son along with him to Europe for a year in Germany to complete his medical education . The tension as the weeks passed was intense . Few knew of it outside the family , but at home the atmosphere was breathless . The week of the final problems , when their drawings were finally exhibited and the contestants waited for the judges to make their decision , hardly a soul in the household could sleep . Then the news burst forth . Fred had won ! He had won ! He had achieved the highest honor accorded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long years of effort he had capped the family striving , begun when his parents , saving every free penny that they owned , had sent him to school . And he , because it was what in a man should be expected , had applied himself and worked . Not that he did n't have the original talent  --  but he had painstakingly and persistently applied himself and won . He had won the prize ! He would go to Rome , to Rome , think of it ! To Rome to study and his brother would go to Europe likewise ! His mother kissed him and promised that she would go to see him at least once during those three long years ; they would take a trip over , she and his father . His father put his arms around him and congratulated him . Even kissed him on the cheek . And Charlie , his brother , was fairly beside himself with joy . You might think that it was he who had won the prize , he was so proud and happy . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were talking together in the back yard , Fred turned to his brother and said , " Will you go to Charlotte ? " His brother looked at him sullenly , knowing well what was about to be said . " Tell her each of us wants to marry her . Tell her to choose between us . One of us will have to do it , because if you wo n't go , I will . Will you ask her ? " " No . " " Then I 'll go . " " Go ahead . " Always , if you 're going to ask a woman to marry you , ap259cynical old friend had once advised Charlie , do it before noon , because you want to have your wits about you . Fred had done it before noon . Charlie did n't see his brother to speak to for the rest of the day , either one or the other being out of the house when the other was there . They did see each other at supper , but Fred disappeared soon after and Charlie went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back yard , Charlie said to him , " Well , how did you make out ? " " She accepted me , " said Fred . " Fine , " said Charlie and then , disgracefully , he flung his arms about his brother 's neck and went mad . Fred was embarrassed , loosened himself from his brother 's hold and fled . Charlie thought the earth had dissolved under his feet . He had n't foreseen the sweep of his emotional reaction or the wreckage it would cause . Had Fred been decent enough about it ? He had . He had done everything one man could do for another , under the circumstances . In fact the perfection of his behavior only added to the effect . And yet something had come to an end . It was a deeper wound than he should ever thereafter in his life be able to sound . It was bottomless . At last Lottie had found her mate . Charlie congratulated the two lovers and  --  really he was ashamed of himself  --  when alone sobbed and sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back his unreasoning tears . And then it left him . Like a flash . He made up his mind and was determined to act upon it.  |p260More  than once during the preceding months when she observed the long train of suitors who had been flocking to pay homage to her elder daughter  --  and little Flossie was beginning to come along as well with her kiddish admirers  --  Gurlie had singled out the elder Bishop boy for her attention . They did n't any of them add up to much ; most of them she rejected forthwith . But that boy , the young doctor , had particularlyirritated her . " That boy ! " she would say in the hearing of her daughters . " He 's a selfish one . All he wants to do is sit in the house and write poems all day long . He says so himself . He is n't the slightest interested in money . That 's what he says . He 'll be poor , just a poor doctor  --  who writes poems . Poo ! " That was all for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . Neither of the girls ever replied . But Flossie knew , at least , that her father liked the young man . That gave her a little comfort . Not that the Bishop boy had ever addressed more than a passing word to her , but she had not given up hope . She loved him . It was unreasonable . Nothing would ever come of it . But she liked his nose . What a silly thing ! But there it was , she loved him , secretly . It was no one 's business but her own ; she never even mentioned his name aloud . His nose fascinated her.  |p261The  day after Fred 's engagement to Charlotte , the elder brother disappeared . He remained at home looking out the window or lying on his bed . He ate nothing at all . His mother admonished him , telling him that he would make himself ill , that he would get over it and . . . " Over what ? " he barked back at her savagely . " Well , over your grief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brought him about . For after all , what else was she to call it ? He felt sorry for her , helpless as she was , and smiled . And took a little plate of soup she had prepared for him the second day and on the third day went out of doors again . After all , the world goes on as usual no matter how we feel about it , he said to himself . No , I 'll be damned if it will this time . It 's going my way . It was still no more than ten o'clock in the morning . He went back into the house , called Flossie on the phone and by luck got her in person . " Are you in ? I want to come down and see you . " " Yes . " Again , fortunately , when he arrived at the familiar residenceno one else was about . " Let 's sit on the porch awhile . " " Sure . What is it ? " " Florence , " he said , " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a little startled , she did n't show it  --  it was so unemotionally put that she may not have realized the full significance of the words . He was obviously in a disturbed mental state . Perhaps her heart sank . But all she said was , " You do n't love me . You love my sister . " " I do not love your sister . " " But you do n't love me . " He looked down . Then he looked up , straight into her eyes . " I do n't love anyone , " he said , " but I want to marry you . I think we can be happy . " That was a stumper for a young girl . She had been in love for a year , perhaps two years , with the man and somehow hep262knew it  --  and counted on it . He presumed , insolently presumed , on it to seize her . He wanted her , but refused to lie to get her . Either she would take him as he was and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . He himself was without love  --  for the time being  --  but if she loved him and would have him , here he was at her feet . She at least shall have her way , that will be a beginning . " I 'll make a go of it no matter what anyone else says or does . I will . I refuse to go under . I refuse to be licked . Meanwhile , here is this girl , there is love about her . " He could n't say that he saw it shining in her eyes , he did n't . But he had been conscious for some time , he realized now , of her presence in his environment . He felt her now as love itself . He could n't have recognized it sooner , he had n't been able to . It had taken a cataclysm to bring it to a head , but , as he looked back now , it had always been there . It had always been rejected , as he himself now had been rejected . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Together they , having found out what love is , having been rejected , and what it could do , with their eyes open , could and would face it together . One thing was certain , he was not going to start over again what he had in this tragic experience already been through . Finis . Full stop . From now on , having gone through that , he was done with it  --  whether she would have him or not . But if she said yes , even without florid declarations of love , they could , she loving him and therefore willing to take his lead , they could  --  for he would teach her what comes after love  --  they two could make a life of it . They might even conceivablymake a superb life of it . He would never go back . Never . There is a sort of love , not romantic love , but a love that with daring can be made difficultly to blossom . It is founded on passion , a dark sort of passion , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as all life is despair . She , young , in love , would add her portion , and he , wiser , would add his . And it would never come to an end . It wouldp263be a marriage that would be founded on human understanding that would be difficult but passionate , passionate as one says of a saint  --  those saints that were womanly , or , like St. Francis , full of compassion . It could be like no other love that had been conceived between a man and a woman . How could he explain that to her ? He could n't . She would n't know what he was saying except by pure instinct . But it was valid , it was a real thing , it was not an adulteration , not a leftover from her sister 's bouquet . It was a vivid , living thing  --  of a new sort . Whatever his genius , right or wrong , he had had the drive to get her to commit herself in downright fashion , with the belief that she , knowing the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide . It was tough on a young girl , but with uncompromising cruelty , as to one who would be his wife , he proposed the question and watched , fascinated , to see what would result . " I do n't know . " The young girl , who , after all , had never faced a problem of such seriousness in her life , wanted to think . He respected her decision and went off . He knew she would not tell her mother , certainly not her sister . She , a woman , would not go to her father , a man . This was her affair . She spent the whole day upon the problem . He had said that he would call that night for an answer . She loved him , of that she was sure , and now  --  after the humiliationshe had suffered from his neglects , the off-hand way he had always treated her  --  the prize had fallen into her lap . She should be angry , not pleased . He had not even said he loved her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you marry me ? " and in a few weeks ( she must keep it secret ) he was going away to Europe . Even their good-byes would have to be secret and  --  for a year ! Anything can happen in a year . Maybe he 'd grow tired of her . Maybe she 'd tire of him . She was young , hardly more than a child . What 's a year ? She 'd be unhappy for awhile and then everything would all go on as before . Why not ? Why not say I 'll marry him ? Butp264she knew , if she said yes , it would be the end for her . And she knew that he knew it too . If she said yes , that would be the end . All day long she tossed the ball about , one way , then the other , and that evening when he came to call she said , " Let 's take a walk . " Protected by the darkness , they headed around the old farm that still occupied the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They walked apart . She began , as rightly she should have done , to object to his coldness . She was not used to men so much older than herself , perhaps it was their way , she was in her own mind still a child and did not know exactly how to proceed . You do n't know what a man 's intentions may be . It was tough . Finally , at the far side of a field , in the darkness she paused and , hanging her head , said very doubtfully to him , " Yes , I 'll marry you . " He put his arms about her body , holding her close , and attempted to kiss her . She was scared at her own temerity and half-turned away her face so that he touched only half her mouth with his lips . But it was enough . He took her hand and they continued around the block together . The next day the family was going off for the summer  --  he would not see her again for another year . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more torment than happiness , they parted . And he sailed away for a year and a day  --  and Gurlie saw the letters coming regularly and surmised enough so that she gave her young daughter the devil . " You 're making a fool of yourself . " Her sister , too , looked at her as if she had caught her stealing her stockings . " Are you engaged to Charlie Bishop ? " " What do you care ? " " I do n't care . My God , the children nowadays ! He 'll never marry you . " Flossie wanted to get a job now that she had graduated from her precious finishing school . She was accredited for herp265sophomore year at Vassar , where Gurlie would have liked to send her to break up this silly infatuation . She refused to go . Her father frowned on a business career . And when she suggested becoming a nurse , the whole family fairly howled . " You a nurse ? You 're not husky enough , " though in a fragile way she was strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that summer at the shore again , whatever it was that had changed about her , she suddenly became a woman , and her boyfriends with whom she had grown up began to propose marriage to her . She had , with misgivings , to refuse them all even when , in the bay in a catboat , one vigorous youth so lost his temper when he discovered the true situation that he stamped on the boat bottom knockingthe bung out and the water rushed in glub glub glub ! So that he had to replug it with rags and whatever else he could find . She loved the waves and was a good yachtswoman . Within a year Lottie and Fred , with two years of his absence still to go , had broken off their engagement as intolerable . Charlie had returned after his year of study and travel . On the ship he had been pursued by an importunate young woman who had begged him to marry her . She was wealthy and would set him up in practice outside of Pittsburgh . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She wo n't be there . " " Nevertheless . . . " And Flossie was not there . He had been at times an insulting lover , impossible for a girl to put up with . Toward the end she had refused to reply to his letters . Nevertheless , he would not give up till he had talked to her , which he did immediately after he had deposited his luggage at his parents ' home and greeted them . She was cold and distant . He had hurt her by his taunts and indifference . She had at one time sent him a photo , a formal picture of herself done by a fashionable New York photographer : her hair was fixed in a great bulging mass above her forehead , held in place as it was in those days . It infuriatedp266him . But when he saw that the awkward , young-girl 's curve of her neck had been retouched , her shoulders smoothed over by the " skill " of that God-damned photographer he was infuriated  --  ather for permitting such contemptible practices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraping the surface of the photo away , restored the normal , the actual , not beautifulcontours of the neckline . That was better . But he could do nothing with the hair . And so he had put the picture on his chiffonier in his narrow room in Leipzig and wrote his bitter letters . They were not all such . Sometimes , as when he was in Italy , he was so carried away by the beauties and antiquities of the scene that he filled his letters with love for her . Once at Fiesole , above Florence , he had watched an early airplane try to get up off the ground , watched from a temple ruin and saw it fail . Then back to the hotel to fill page after page with his descriptions . Toward the last , she had given him back his freedom  --  as he apparently had wanted it . And now here he was again . What was this thing : to be married ? Certainly it did not appear to be a happy thing . It was not so for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he was so insistent that after a few days she melted and , against her better judgment , gave in once more . Gurlie was more or less aware of what was going on and she more or less accepted it . This young man was not her choosing . And , after all , what could he see in that skinny thing , her younger daughter ? He 'd never amount to much with his lack of ambition , but she liked him , in a way . Lottie had taken up her music again more seriously than ever , she was constantly practicing , perfecting herself in her techniques . The summer after her younger sister 's fiance 's return , the family took a small cottage at Monroe , New York . It was not too far away  --  a flourishing community of dairy farms  --  and the orchards , the scenery and air were superb . They had heard of a Revolutionary farmhouse , very smallp267but very picturesque . It had near it a spring in an old-fashionedwell house , a crystal brook on the premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a horse . This , at last , was getting close to the real thing . It looked as though here or hereabouts Gurlie would find her bastion , her satisfaction . Everyone liked it  --  even Joe . There was an ancient forge on the property , and , to make them laugh , the people who owned it kept a little jackass in the old orchard , called Sonje . Here Flossie could be visited by her doctor lover , here little Paul could grow up , here Lottie could plan her winter concerts and here Gurlie could dream . The community was convenient enough to New York City for Stecher 's daily train trip if necessary.  |p268The  spring , not ten feet from the kitchen door , must have determined the location of the house in the first place . It was the source for more than the mere water it gave . And though the farm had been abandoned long since for higher ground , the old house still stood . It attracted Gurlie with her sense of the primitive , the elemental . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything . She had rented the place for the summer . And what water ! The well house , built into the side of a bank , was made of boards that by being constantly soaked had become as hard as iron . It was a cavity facing north , into which the sun never reached , protecting its coolness in the semidark . But if you waited a moment for your eyes to grow used to the shadow you could see the movement of the white sand at the bottom , a live thing , where the icy water was profusely bubbling up . On hot summer days when you 'd go there for a pitcher of water you 'd stand a moment or two under the well-house roof to watch that ceaseless stream gushing from the earth . It refreshed the mind as it promised to refresh the body . You waited , almost enjoying the dryness of your throat , prolonging the anticipation of the delight which relief would afford . And the mind , too , drank of the idea of that spring.  |p269That  it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Stechers were no more than city folks . Like all such people , they did n't know much about the country . They loved the place . The natives did n't think much of it . Therefore it was on its last legs . A couple years more and the roof would fall in . That would be the end of it . But to Lottie and to Gurlie , especially , it was romantic , and for the moment completely satisfying . Little Paul loved to play in the brook ; the steep dirt road up the hill eastward , a side road , was used by no one ; the little donkey nodded half-asleep among the rotting apple trees . It was more to Gurlie than just a place to spend the summer ; it was the beginning of the realization of an ambition . She had found her objective in this idyllic spot . They hung their hammocks under the old broken willows by the brook 's edge , Lottie rented a piano while apple blossoms were still on the trees , and the whole family settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come next . On rainy days there was the old colonial fireplace , an authentic reminder of other days . It had a broad hearth , wide and deep , and the forged-iron crane was still in place . Lottie chortled with glee when she first saw it . Built in to the right was the primitive oven where bread had been baked . They planned some day , when they could gather enough wood , to use it at least once during the summer . It had the authentic feeling that took Gurlie back to her family 's farmstead in Norway . " We 've got to have a horse , " said Gurlie . " Get one , " said her husband . " Do you think one of these farmers is going to give it to you ? " It just happened that a doctor back in Riverdale was at that time switching to his first automobile and told them he 'd sell his mare to them cheap . " Cheap ! " said Joe . " I can imagine . " " Charlie and Floss can drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take care of her ? " " We can do it , " Lottie offered . " It is n't much trouble . "  | " And I suppose the harness and the carriage goes with the deal ? " said Joe . " Of course . " " And who 's going to feed her , buy oats , hay and fix the roof of the barn and put her out to . . . ? " He did n't know himself much about the details of taking care of a horse . " Agh , you ! " said his wife . And so it was arranged to have Floss and Charlie drive the little mare the forty miles to the farm . Which she willingly enough accomplished except for the last hill , at which she balked , and the young doctor had to get out and lead her . But she did it at last and was none the worse for it once they had stabled her , rested her , watered her and fed her . Now indeed they were established . A nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , became their advisor and protector . " You like the place , do you ? " " We love it , " Charlotte had said . " Take you around soon 's I get a little time and show you the whole section . There are some nice estates out around here in the hills . Quite a lot of money has been coming into these parts in recent years . " " Is that so ? " said Gurlie , pricking up her ears . " Yes , it was n't two or three years ago you could pick up these farms for a song . House and barns , the whole thing for a few hundred dollars . No more . " " Why was that ? " " No money in farming around here now , it 's good dairy country and some makes a go of it , but it 's hard work . And nobody wants to work like that today . Real estate 's the thing . I 'll drive you around some time and show you the place . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the nearest farm ; you could see it through the trees , off the narrow dirt road , a large clapboard building painted white with neat lawns and well-trimmed hedges around it . It faced a pasture sloping down to the same little stream that continued past the Stechers ' cottage . The fences about it were in first/rate order and at the pasture bottom where the ground was inclined to be swampy , Joe had noticed some newly cut ditches with tile pipe laid along each of them to be put in for drainage . Altogether it looked to be a well-kept farm . " You look as if you were making money , " said Gurlie in her downright way . " Got to keep things up , " said George Nash . " But I 'm getting too old for the work . If I did n't have this real-estate business  --  a sale once in a while . . . " " Oh go on , " said Gurlie , " I 'll bet you 've got a pile of money in the bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be making money . That apple orchard you have by the house is the most healthy-looking I 've ever seen , loaded with fruit . I 've been waiting to see your daughters . I hear they 're pretty . " " Nice girls , Inez and Hattie are nice girls . Their mother 's downright proud of them . Well , have a good summer . I suppose we 'll be seeing you once in awhile . Come up to the house and meet Mrs. Nash . I think you 'll get along . " " And the milk and eggs  --  and vegetables ? Can we get them from you ? " " The girls 'll leave what you order every morning right by the fence post at the corner of the lot there every morning when they drive to town . A dozen eggs . All right . Come up and see us any time you like . " When the two girls finally appeared a day or two later , Joe , who was there , blinked . He had , literally , never in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in their simple farm dresses . They did n't look like farm girls at all but more as if they were made up for a Broadway show . Except that they were not made up , they were real  --  and they were able . " Where did you come from ? " Gurlie said , when she first saw them . " We are Mr. Nash 's daughters , with the milk , " the dark one said , and her blond sister smiled . " Come here , Lottie , yoohoo ! " Gurlie called . " Look . "  | " Oh , " Charlotte uttered amazed . " Who are you ? " She could n't believe her eyes . " They are our neighbors , " said Gurlie . " Why , you 're beautiful . Sit down here a minute . " She pointed to the chairs on the low porch in front of the cottage . " I want to look at you . Are all the young ladies up here as pretty as you ? Now , that 's what I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , in an old dress , her hair awry had been lounging about the house . " That 's the way you should look . " " Are you staying all summer ? " said the older girl , quite at ease . " It 's so nice to have a neighbor . " " Do you like it here ? " said her sister . And that 's the way the summer had begun . Up the hill beyond the little brook where the road crossed it , out of sight , was the neglected house of the old lady who owned the little cottage , the aristocrat of the region . She never went out , the fields were overgrown  --  an eccentric . But she was glad to see Gurlie when she called and seemed to liven up quite a bit . Her son was a physician , as his father had been also , and lived elsewhere . The old lady , aside from occasional visitors in summer , was quite alone . It was her little donkey that wandered the old orchard . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-asleep under a tree hourlong , but when you tried to go up to him he 'd move off , at a leisurely gait , but effectively for all that . His coat was heavy and matted . Nobody from the old house came near him . " He has a corner , up the hill beyond the barn , " they said . " He stays out of doors the year round . He 's old . He used to belong to the little grandchildren when they lived here years ago . They 're grown up now . They do n't come any more . We call him the philosopher . He gets along . " Hee haw ! Hee haw ! You could hear him bray now and again . " There goes the old philosopher ! " said Joe once , on hearing it . He liked the little fellow . " He 's telling you what he thinks of you . "  |p273They  were a scant mile and a half from the town . Very few wagons and no carriages ever passed that way . So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oriole and the tanager , the indigo bunting , thrushes , and in the little patch of cattails where there was standing water , red-winged blackbirds were never disturbed . In the earlier part of the summer the girls found several patches of wild strawberries growing profusely in the grass , so much so that they preserved more than a dozen jars of them to take home for the winter . But most of the time they merely wandered about the fields or read books , did a minimum of cooking , went to town on simple errands . It was an easy walk , past the ruined limekiln , past the Jones farm , that looked very well tended atop its high bank , past the race track where later on they were to witness the nearby trotting races , and so to the stores , the post office , where , around the curve , right through the street , you might say , the Chicago Express would roar , shaking the ground , setting the dust flying and occasionally killing someonetoo little cautious , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After such a trip along the hot roads , what a relief it was to get back , a little footsore , to the cottage by the spring ! It became home to them as the summer wore on , a real home where Lottie practiced patiently ; and once in a while the Nash girls , so fresh and wholesome-looking , came to sit unseen , if they could arrange it that way , to hear her . To them Lottie was a world away . They thought of her as something miraculous . Though they were intelligent , exceptionally so , they felt lost beside her . It was a lazy time . Lottie had acquired a two-months-old Irish setter pup . He was lovely , but after the first day she had him , he yipped all night long keeping her awake . So the next day she spent her entire time keeping him awake . Never for a moment did she let him rest . If he flopped down and closed his eyes , as a pup will , she was after him . She prodded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her finger . She took him for several long walks , though he balked and pulled against his leash . That night he slept the sleep of the dead . On week-ends sometimes they 'd have visitors . Charlie would come up to spend the day with his wife to be . They 'd go off for long walks alone , lie together under an apple tree , out of sight side by side and talk or whatever it is that young lovers do . One tree whose branches arched over to touch the ground all around them was their private bower . Lottie , too , had her callers again . Krieger was there one Sunday during a veritable mushroom bounty . The well-grazed pastures and under the trees of the old orchard were literally peppered with them . There were thousands . The family had eaten them stewed , fried with butter , on toast , on steak , in every way imaginable  --  and on top of that , besides the pasture mushroom , there were hundreds of puff balls , some half as big as your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried while they were young , were as delicious as any other form of the fungus . The four of them , Lottie , Flossie , Krieger and Charlie were walking up the hill when it occured to one of the boys to throw these fragile but heavy balls of fluff first against a tree , then playfully at one of the girls , then more seriously at each other . It developed into a regular war . They 'd pick them from the ground as though they were snowballs , running right and left to find some bigger ones , then letting fly , smash them on each other 's backs , legs . Krieger at one time sent the family a crate of live lobstersfrom one of his salesman 's trips to Maine . Far in the distance was Sugar Loaf , which they planned one day to climb . But in general , through sunny days , first decorating the house with wild crab-apple blossoms , then dogwood , blue flags and daisies to goldenrod and purple asters as it got toward fall , the summer passed happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year round ? " Gurlie would say to the Nash girls.  | " Oh we go to high school now . We have a good high school here . And summers we work on the farm . There 's a lot to do . We milk and cultivate the garden , and help Mother in the house . When there is haying we drive the team or take over the rake . " " That 's what makes you so healthy . " " Do n't get any ideas , " Lottie would say to her mother , " that when you get your farm I 'm going to do any of that . Not on your life . "  |p276It  was a broad , barren hilltop with a fine view over the entire surrounding country  --  several acres , with a breast-high wall of fieldstone crawling like a snake to close in the area . " You ca n't grow anything here , " said Gurlie . " But look at the view , " said the powerful young man sitting in the carriage beside her . Lottie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding a little girl on her lap , another , older girl at her side , occupied the rear seat . The black horse , who was puffing from the winding hill road up which he had just dragged them , paused as the place first came into view . " Marvelous ! " said Lottie . " What a site ! " " Do you think so ? " said the man , turning about . " Yes , I think it pretty fine myself . " " You get tired of it , " said Dora , the wife . " Are you tired of it , darling ? " " After a year or two you do feel as if a change would n't do any harm . " Gurlie looked around . She had n't yet got used to the Oxford accent . Lottie , too , glanced at the young woman ; her expression as she spoke had n't in the least altered . The horse started up again approaching a gap in the wall , the entrance gateway.  | " And that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We often wondered who lived there . " " Yes , " said the man . " What a pity we 've wasted so much time . " When the Stechers had arrived at their little bird 's nest of a cottage the second year , prepared for another lazy and profitable time , the Monroe Gazette had run a notice of the event in the local news column : The Joseph Stechers of Riverdale , N. J. , have taken the Genou cottage for another season , their second in our midst . Miss Charlotte Stecher , the distinguished concert pianist , is here for a rest after her last successful season . Lottie laughed ! We are happy to have the Stechers with us . Monroe is getting to be a popular summer resort for many New York artists . A day or two later , Gurlie had received a note , on blue paper with a crest , from a Gregory Ives  --  " Who 's he ? "  --  saying that he was their neighbor  --  " I never heard of him "  --  that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concert grand Steinway in his studio which he would be happy to put at the disposal of Miss Stecher , and that , with Mrs. Stecher 's permission , he with his wife and children would like to call . Lottie was frozen to the spot , wondering what her mother would say . Gurlie hesitated a moment then said to her daughter , " Write him a note . " " Me ? " " Yes , I do n't want to bother with it . Write to his wife and ask them to call . " That was how it started . Two days later they arrived , a strapping fellow with straight , straw-colored hair and what appeared to be weak eyes , a man in his middle thirties , a long jaw and the wrists and forearms of a heavyweight prize fighter . With one of his little girls beside him he filled the front seat of the carriage . His much younger , dark-haired wife , with the other little girl ,  |p278seemed  frail beside him . He got down , leaving his wife to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to introducehimself . Now as the carriage ground slowly over the graveled driveway , Gurlie looked right and left . It was not one of those manicured places of the usual city dweller come to establish himself in the country . There was a vague attempt at flowers , but in general , due to the lack of water on this hilltop , the grass was scanty with rock outcroppings evident all about what would otherwise have been a lawn . " Do you want to get out here ? " he asked the ladies . " Or shall we drive down to the barn and walk around a bit first ? " " I and the children will get out here , " said the British wife . " You can go on if you like . " " I 'll get out , too , " said Lottie . " Oh , do n't you want to look at the view ? " asked Mr. Ives . " No . I 'll go in with your wife and the children . " " But I want to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the children alighted . They were good little girls , rather shy and subdued . They did n't say anything , but ran to the house as soon as their feet touched the ground and were admitted by a maid . Lottie and the young mother followed while the carriage proceeded to the barn where Ives unharnessed the horse himself and put him in his stall . " Do you take care of him yourself ? " asked Gurlie . " No , the farmer does that , but when he 's not around I do what is necessary . Let 's go out this way . Around behind the barn is a good place to start . " Gurlie , who was not too sure afoot , followed with her short steps over the stony path . It was a clear , sunny day with scarcely any mist . You could see twenty miles or more westward over a wooded valley with a few white farmhouses scattered about in the distance . At the back was Sugar Loaf projecting above the scene.  |p279Gurlie  looked but was not interested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is no good to grow anything . " " My property line is the other side of that pasture . Where , you see , the stone wall ends . But we have a garden . I 'll show you . " And they came down from the little lift in the ground where they were standing and began to circle the house . " Did you build the house yourself ? " asked Gurlie . It rose before them now , a square three-storied pile made of fieldstone . " Yes , I designed it . " " You are an architect ? " asked Gurlie . " I am an artist . That 's why this place appealed to me . The light . There is nothing to obstruct the light here . " " Hum , " said Gurlie , " but there are no trees . I ca n't imagine a home in the country without trees . " " Trees wo n't grow here . " " So I see . But you said you were going to show the garden . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , across the road . " And there in a dip under the summit of the hill Gurlie did see a patch of corn sprouting in rows and the tilled soil assigned to what would later be the other vegetables . " Hm , " she said again , and shook her head . " It must be hot here in the middle of summer . " " The house is very comfortable . The studio takes in the whole three stories , right to the roof , and it is on the north side , so that the sun never beats into it . It 's always cool there . Shall we go in now ? " " No , no , no , no , " said Gurlie . " Do you have any cows ? " " No , it is n't worth it in this dairy country . We 're only two miles out of town . " " And what is that ? " asked Gurlie , seeing a low , monumentlikebuilding to the north of the house in the center of a field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the man incredulously . " Do you mean that ? " " Yes . " " Why is that ? " " I wanted him here . " " But is n't that a strange thing , to have a tomb like that in the middle of a bare field ? Why did you do that ? I should think . . . " It was a new-looking heap of blue granite of no particular distinction right out of the field , as bare of planting or lawn as the rest of the grounds . They went up to it . Gurlie looked for some legend , some lettering . There was none . " Who was your father ? " " General Jonathan Ives . " " Where do your people come from ? " asked Gurlie in her usual blunt manner . " Did you ever hear of Mme. Jumel ? " " Yes , " said Gurlie . " She was a bad woman . " Ives smiled . " Well , she was my great-grandmother . " " Oh , " said Gurlie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of different men during the Revolutionary War . Shocking . " " My great-grandmother was a brilliant woman . The morals of the time were such that she got a bad reputation . She was merely ahead of her generation . There are always ; women like that during periods of great stress . She understood what was going on and  --  profited by it . " " Yes , I have visited the Jumel Mansion in New York . " " Have you ? Then you know . My father was her son 's son . " " She was rich . Huh ! She knew how . Did your father have money ? " Ives was willing to talk . " What was his business ? " " The hotel business . The family owns the Hotel Ives andthe Hotel Picardy on Fifth Avenue . And some other hotels . " " Then you must be rich , " said Gurlie . " That explains it.  |p281If  you were n't rich , you would n't want to stay in a place like this . This is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfort . This is too bare . I suppose you paint to amuse yourself . Do you sell your paintings ? " " I have sold a few paintings . " " Oh , well . You do n't know much about how the other half lives , " she said with her insane laugh . " Rich people do n't know anything . " " I 'm not rich , " said Ives . " Agh ! " said Gurlie slapping him on the arm and laughing . As much as to say , Who do you think you 're talking to ? " What do you do with yourself all day long with two little girls like that up here ? And your wife , I wonder what she thinks of it ? I bet she wishes she was back in England sometimes . " " Maybe she does , " said Ives . " Does she like it ? I would n't . Not even a flower to look at . Are those weeds ? " she said pointing to a clump of blue flowers beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd pick some and take them in the house . What are they ? I 'm going to pick some and take them in to your wife . Have n't you got a flower book with illustrations ? I want to know what they are . " And she tried to pick a spray of the showy blue stalks , but they were too tough . " Here , pick me some . " He crouched down , his heavy thighs flexed , the muscles bulging as he did so , and ripped a bunch of the weed up by the root . " You should n't have done that . You are too strong . " So they went along a poorly marked path , she clutching the weed in her grip , around to the front of the house . He opened the door and they went in . " How dark it is ! " said Gurlie rubbing her eyes . " Just the change of light . " They listened , but could hear no voices , so he led her directly through the entry hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three stories , to the roof above . " Well , " said Gurlie . It was obviously the center of interest to the interior of the house , the other rooms being merely applied about it.  |p282And  featured in it , a little to the left of the big north window , where an easel stood , was a concert grand piano to which Gurlie went at once , after sweeping her eyes about the four walls , to read the lettering over the keyboard . " A Steinway , no less . Well everything is certainly in the grand style . " Ives was fidgeting about , wondering where the others had gone to , but Gurlie kept his attention , a little to his beginning annoyance , by plying him with questions . " You told me you had a nature book . Look up this flower . I want to know what it is . " " Yes , " he said absently , going to the bookcase , the books all helter-skelter in an unlighted corner , coming up after a moment with a flower book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand . " Here it is . Bugloss . " But just at that moment a door opened and the voices of the young women could be heard as they entered the room . Ives was relieved . Gurlie , without hesitation , called out to her daughter , " What do you think ? He has his father 's tomb right there outside the window . " " Mother ! " said Lottie . " Oh is n't this a fine room ! " " You must be a regular artist . It 's just like the pictures you see of a studio . A regular Bohemian atmosphere , " said Gurlie . " You should see the rest of the house . It 's charming . " " Not now . I want to rest . " " Have you seen this ? " " No , what 's that ? A pile of waste paper ? " The other three laughed . In the middle of the studio was indeed a pile of paper , an enormous pile , a veritable mountain made up of envelopes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you looked closer you saw that many of them bore special-delivery stamps . All had been opened and lay helterskelterthere piled up without order . " What is that ? " asked Gurlie . " Poems . "  | " What kind of poems ? Are they yours ? " " A contest . They have been pouring in from all over the United States . " " And Canada , " added Dora . " My sister 's fiance is a poet , " said Lottie . " Would he know about the contest ? " " Oh , " said Ives , " it 's not too late . Tell him to submit one . I call it the Lyric Year . There is a prize of a thousand dollars and there will be a book later . You should see some of them ! " " Are you a poet , too ? " asked Gurlie . " Oh yes , " said his wife , " my husband does a bit of everything . " Greg looked at her sharply , but made no rejoinder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , Miss Stecher ? I 'd love to have you try the piano . " " Maybe your wife will play for us . You play , do n't you ? " " Oh scarcely at all any more , " said Dora . " No , " broke in her husband , " she never played seriously . And now she never touches the piano . It 's just there gathering dust . " " He does n't let me touch anything in this room , " said the young woman quickly . " Do you play then ? " asked Lottie of their host . " No , not a note . Come on . " He went over to her as if he were about to lift her out of her chair . Lottie got up slowly , she was tall , she caught her skirt in her shoe , freed it after a moment , and walked with her slight stoop , her skirt sweeping the floor , to the keyboard , sat down and gently wrung her hands , avoiding the man 's look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Ives . " Anything you like , my dear . " " Do you like Bach ? " " I adore him . " Lottie struck a few chords . The room came alive . " Oh , this is a good instrument , really magnificent . You keep it in tune , I see . " " Oh , he had it tuned when he knew you were coming . "  | " Do n't let 's have so much talk , " said Ives sharply . " We want to hear Miss Stecher play . " " I 'm sorry , " said his wife . " Are n't we rather pushing her ? " The acoustics were superb . Lottie had been practicing a toccata , a work she frequently played at the beginning of a concert to loosen up her fingers . She waited a moment and in the absolute silence of that isolated spot some wasps could be heard buzzing in the high ceiling . She played well , extremely well . The lively music filled the room , its precisions making the ornate vases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little girls came to the studio door and looked in , but when she saw her father she quickly vanished . When Lottie had finished , Ives got up and went toward her . " That 's very beautiful , " said his wife . " We used to have such music at my home in Oxford , England . It takes me back . Bach , " she smiled to herself , " takes me back to those blessed days . " " It sounds very good in this room , " was Gurlie 's comment . " You 're lucky to have a piano like that here . " " I wish your daughter would come here and make use of it . Tell her we 'd like her to come here and make use of it as often as she likes . You tell her , " said the man to his wife . " Yes , of course . I should like it so much . Any time you like . Just come when you want to . We 're always here , " she added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gurlie . " Play something else , " said Greg . " Do you know the Liebestraum ' ? " Mrs. Ives coughed and , getting up , asked to be excused for a moment , she wanted to speak to the maid about the children . Lottie said she had n't played the " Liebestraum " for some time and that she 'd rather not . Instead she struck quite spontaneously into " Anitra 's Dance " from the Peer Gynt Suite . Gurlie had gotten up and wandered to the big window.  |p285Ives  remained leaning on the piano , his chin in his hand , looking at Lottie as she played , looking straight at her eyes which were downcast . When she finished , she got up quickly and went to her mother . " Mother , you have n't seen the house , " she said . " You should see how cleverly it has been designed . " " Yes , " said Gurlie . " I 'd like to see it . " So Ives took the lady in tow . Lottie , having already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but asked if she might not look at some of the poems from the heap in the center of the floor while they were gone . " Here 's a cushion , sit down and help yourself . It 's pathetic . Imagine the emotional backwaters that that heap of manuscripts represents  --  terrible . Horrible ! But we have found a few good ones , one or two really outstanding poems . " " I 'm glad of that , " said Lottie . " They ca n't all be that bad , it ca n't be that there is n't even one . Go on now and leave me alone . " And she sat down taking one poem after another out of the envelopes , reading them and shaking her head . After a moment her hostess returned . " Where have they gone ? " " He 's showing Mother around the house . " " I hope he does n't take her out on that top balcony . It has no railing . I 'm frightened to death of the beastly place . And he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thank you , " said Lottie . " No , but you do . Beautifully . Quite the professional touch . Do you think you 'll be coming here to make use of the piano ? " " It would be an imposition . I could n't . Besides it 's rather far from where we are staying . " " Oh , I 'm certain he 'd adore fetching you . We live such a humdrum life . It would be  --  a great relief . May I call you Charlotte ? My name is Dora . It would be really a pleasure , Charlotte . Come when you can , whenever you like . He 's oftenp286busy and we should be quite alone here . It would be a comfort to me . " Then out of a clear sky : " I think I 'll be going to England , for a visit , in another year . It 's so nice to have you as a neighbor this summer . We ought to have a pleasant time of it . Do you think your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would . " At that moment the voyagers returned . " You go so fast , " Gurlie was saying . " You do n't let me get my breath . " " Do you like it ? " said Dora . Gurlie was always downright . " Well , " she said . . . Dora laughed with a slight touch of bitterness and defiancein her voice . " Neither do I , " she said . " I think it 's horrible . " " Now , my dear , " said Ives . " You 've always said . . . " But she broke in on him , apparently enjoying herself at his expense . " I always said that I could stand it , for a while . It 's a very barren place really  --  unless you 're an artist . " He obviously squirmed , but clamped his jaws shut and went towardLottie , who was just getting up from before the pile of poems . " What do you think of them ? " " I have n't had time . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in . " Yes , I 'd like some , " said Gurlie . " It 's plain to see you 're English . In Norway we drink coffee . " " Would you prefer coffee ? " " No , give me some tea . Thank you . " Then , as Dora left the room Gurlie said to Greg , " Bring me some of those poems , I want to see them . " He picked up a handful and put them in her lap . " Oh , I do n't want to see these , " she suddenly changed her mind . " You are an artist , " she said , " show us some of your paintings . You must have some over there against the wall . " " No , I 'm not working on anything just now . What I 'm most interested in is the portrait . Do you know the work of Seurat ? " " Who is that ? "  | " A French artist . He calls himself a pointillist . I 'm very much interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors , tiny points of pure color placed one beside the other from the tip of a brush . When the canvas is covered by them the eye blends them all together to make the design . I should like to paint a portrait of your daughter . She has a beautiful profile . " " Now look at that , " said Gurlie . " He wants to paint your portrait . I bet he 's good . Show me what you can do . " With that Ives drew out a small seascape , a misty sea of running waves in a light mist . It was well done , an opalescent canvas of considerable charm . " But that is not a portrait , " objected Gurlie . " My , you can paint ! He can paint , " said she to her daughter . " It 's beautiful , " said Lottie . " I see you 've been showing them your paintings , " said Dora , re-entering with the maid who was carrying the tea things . " We 're not losing much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He 's an artist , all right , " said Gurlie . " And to think you were here all last summer and we saw the house there on the top of the hill . It just looked like a square barn  --  and we did n't know who lived there . Well , now . " " Ca n't we see more ? " " After tea , my dear . Sha n't we ? I do n't know how you Americans prefer it . Will you have Russian tea or would you prefer cream and sugar ? " Dora had prepared some delicate little sandwiches which she passed about . Gurlie noticed that Ives was not joining them , and remarked upon it . " Oh you do n't know my husband . He never takes tea or coffee . " " What ? " " Tell them , my dear . He 's a very particular eater . He never eats meat . We have foods from a place called Battle Creek , Michigan , wherever that may be . Nuts and breakfast foods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lottie in private conversation and seemed not to hear . " Does he drink any schnapps ? " asked Gurlie . " Any what ? " " Schnapps . " " Darling , " she asked her husband , " what are schnapps ? " " Brandy , " said Gurlie . " It 's good for you . " And so the afternoon wore on until it was getting time for them to go . The tea things had been cleared away , but before his guests should leave , Ives asked Charlotte to play once more . " Yes , do , " said Dora . So that Charlotte , obliging as always , went to the piano and sat down with her hands in her lap . " Now this time , " insisted her host , " you must play the Liebestraum . ' " " You can play it perfectly well , " said Gurlie . " Come on , we 've got to go home . " So Lottie began to play the " Liebestraum , " while this time Ives went to the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him once or twice , while Gurlie in the center of the room sat with half-closed eyes as was her wont . A purple wasp was crawling , its body pulsating slowly up and down over the tabouret where the sandwiches had rested . Now he got up and flew toward the piano . Lottie was the first to see it . Crying out " Oh ! " she abruptly stopped playing and stood up . Everyone jumped . " A wasp , " she said . Dora said , " Oh , we 're quite used to them . They have their nests on the ceiling . " But Ives got up and went toward the table to which the thing had returned . Lottie said " Oh , oh , " cowering as the insect took off and flew toward her again pursued by the man . But now it continued rising toward the windows and went off . Lottie played no more.  | " It 's been a wonderful afternoon , " said she walking from the piano . " Oh , wo n't you finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away . " Yes , " said Ives , seconding his wife . " I 'll pick you up and you can spend the day here whenever you like . I want to paint your portrait . " " Paint a portrait of my little son , too , " said Gurlie . " I 'll do that . A good idea . He can come with his sister . " " How was it ? " said Floss when they got home . " Mother , you were terrible , " said Lottie . " You practicallyasked him . . . " " Agh , " said Gurlie . " I know what I 'm doing . " " What was he like ? What I saw of him , his pants were too tight , " said Flossie . " The pig . I hate him , " Lottie replied , " and I refuse to go there again . His poor wife . " " You ought to be ashamed of yourself , " Gurlie came back at her . " He 's a perfect gentleman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p290Astrid  was a good little mare . She liked nothing better than to run to town for the marketing . The Welch Brothers ' butcher shop , on the curve of the road next to the drug store , could be counted on for excellent cuts of meat . They knew Gurlie there , and liked her . She was a good buyer , not easy to fool . " What 'll it be this morning Mrs. Stecher ? We have some nice legs of lamb , well hung . The best . About eight pounds . What do you say ? " But Gurlie was n't looking . " That last one you sold me was tough , and you know it was tough . If you ca n't do better than that . . . " The farm people came in and just stood around , silent , or talked privately to the elder brother . Their orders were sometimes as much as they could carry . The boarding-house orders were even bigger , ten-pound roasts , two or three hams , a dozen chickens . Saturday-morning shopping was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitched to a post at the high curb , Gurlie would go to Mr. Miller , the grocer , while Lottie might call for the mail or wander up the street looking in at one of the dry-goods store windows at the farm dresses and hats displayed there . She knew her mother would be slow , so often she 'd wander several blocks or even go beyond the Congregational church , round the memorial boulder at thep291corner of the little park , get even as far as the abandoned entrance to the half-mile trotting track  --  where in the early summer violets still were blossoming in the heavy grass . " Good morning , Mrs. Stecher , " the white-aproned Mr. Miller would say as Gurlie came busting in . " How are you this morning ? " " I feel fine . Where is everybody ? " " Oh they 'll be along after while . What can I do for you ? " " Let me sit down , " said Gurlie . " Take your time . Have you met any of our new people yet this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces around . " " What do you know about Mr. Ives , the artist ? He lives up on the hill past . . . " " You do n't need to tell me about that man . You mean Affinity Ives ' ? I 've known him since before he was married the first time . He grew up around here . Used to run with Sadie Brower 's daughter . But she turned him down . They say he 's all right with a paint brush . Comes of a fine family . Lots of money . But he 's sort of the black sheep of the litter . How 'd you meet him ? " " Do n't let me forget , " said Gurlie . " I want a pound of that sharp cheese . American cheese you call it , crumbles . . . " " I know just what you mean . Excuse me a minute . " And he went to the front of the store . Gurlie got up and , wandering over to the vegetable stalls , began picking up what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want a dozen of your best eggs , " she said , when Mr. Miller came back to her . " Yes , that man 's had quite a career  --  I guess he 's been all over the world . He turns up here , though , every so often . Pretty little girl he 's married this time . Maybe this 'll settle him down . I 'll never forget the beating he got a couple of years back . Seems he got a little ahead of himself one night with a fellow who was bigger than he was . " " What happened ? " said Gurlie . " Oh he was coming  --  you take care of Mrs. Jones , will you , George ?  --  he was coming out from the city here one night ,  |p292during  the racing season , and the train was crowded . Was n't a seat to be had and there was a young lady standing in the aisle he thought ought not to be there . " " Well , I 'm glad to see that there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a fellow sitting there reading a paper that Mr. Ives thought ought to give up his seat to the lady . So he spoke to him and told him to get up and give the lady his place . " " Hm , " said Gurlie . " But when the man would n't do it , Ives grabbed him by the collar and pulled him out  --  and you know that Ives is powerful . Why he came in here just a month ago with a sprained hand from taking hold of his horse by the mane when he went to catch him . He pulled a handful of the hair out , he got such a heavy grip on it , but the horse got away . You ca n't hold a horse that way . " " What happened on the train ? " said Gurlie . " Well , I hate to tell you . They had to help young Mr. Ives off it , he was beat up so bad . He was a mess . He really got it that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " said Gurlie , " wrap up those things I laid out on the counter . And the cheese . . . " " All right , ma'am . I 'll put them in the back of the carriage . The usual place ? " " It 's standing right in front of the drug store . And do n't you overcharge me . What are eggs now ? " " Twenty cents a dozen , fresh laid . The finest that can be bought . That Ives is a great fellow . But you got ta watch him . You got ta watch him . He 's not as young as he was , though . Maybe he 's settled down now for good . " Gurlie left the store . She wandered into the Spirits and Wine Emporium where an old fellow in his shirt sleeves , his feet up on the counter , sat half-asleep with a newspaper across his belly . He took his feet down when Gurlie woke him . He did n't know her and looked at her quizzically , without a word. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , ma'am , " said the man , " we have . " " Well , I want a bottle , " said Gurlie . " That 's just what you 'll have then , " he said , getting slowly to his feet and going to the shelves behind where Gurlie was standing . He reached up , got the bottle down and , placing it on the counter , asked her if there was anything else he could do for her . " No , that 's all , " said Gurlie . " It 's a fine day , ma'am . You 're one of the summer people , " he said as he proceeded to wrap the bottle . " I have n't seen you around . " " My husband prints the labels for Old Crow , " said Gurlie . " He says it 's a good whiskey . " " He likes it , eh ? Yes , it 's a good whiskey . Come in again some time . We 've got a lot of it here if you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes before the station an arena of flying dust and dancing papers while the pounding at the rail ends , and the clatter of the loaded cars caused the nags tethered along Main Street curb to dance nervously back and jerk ahead to the limit of their halters . Standing before the store , Gurlie turned her back , gathered her skirts about her and bowed her head before the artificial gale . " Pugh ! " she said as she stood against the wall to let the fury pass . Lottie came down the street just when Gurlie was beginning to look for her . " Yoohoo ! Here I am . " Their purchases were stored in the back of the carriage , some under their feet , and the mile-and-a-half drive back to the cottage lay before them . " I was talking to Mr. Miller , " said Gurlie , " about our friend Mr. Ives . " " Were you ? What did he say ? " " He has a name , Affinity Ives , ' they call him . It seems he 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " That 's awful . What kind of man is that ? " " A marrying man . " The road went south through the village under the elms and maples that met over it , past the old blacksmith shop and the bakery . " Is n't it quiet and beautiful ? " said Lottie . " Such simple flowers as geraniums are charming here . They seem to grow better than at home . Their colors are more intense . I do n't see why anyone lives in the city when they can have this . It 's so beautiful . " When they had crossed the highway which circled the town and started up the long hill past the Jones farm , the valley opened out to the east , well-kept fields beyond the idle grandstand of the race track , the telegraph wires following the railroad throughout the center of it all to rolling hills in the middle distance . " We must drive out that way some time , " said Gurlie . " It looks interesting . " Beyond , rose the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion of the railroad tycoon who had built it for his old age , but he died soon after . The cut for the inclined railroad which led to it from the valley below was clearly discernible . " I wonder what it 's like up there , " said Gurlie . " Why do n't you go and see ? " said Lottie . " You can get passes from someone in the village to visit it when the family is n't there . " " It must be marvelous to have so much money . " The little mare slowed to a walk as the road wound past the golf course on the left . There were several couples on the greens , mostly women , scattered here and there over the course . " I wonder how old he is ? " Lottie did not answer . " What can a man like that . . . " She changed her line of thought . " I wonder what he 's doing in a place like this , with such a reputation . " " Who have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been married three times . " " Four , " said Lottie . " How do you know ? You 've never heard of him before . "  | " I 've heard of him . " " Who have you been talking to ? Who told you he was married four times ? " " Hattie Nash . " " When ? " " Last evening . She says he 's a horrible person . " " So that 's what you were talking about last night there in front of the cottage . " " She does n't like him . She runs when she sees him coming in the village . She 's funny . " " She 's just a country girl . What does she know ? He does n't want her . Besides , he 's married . His children are very charming . When is he coming to get you ? " " I 'm not going . " " But you said you would go . You 're not a child . If everyoneacted that way we 'd sit here all summer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You go , " said Lottie . " You always wanted to get your picture painted . " That nettled Gurlie . " Are you afraid of him ? " she replied to her daughter . " Like these farm girls ? You are supposed to be somebody . He is an artist . He can perhaps help you . If I were your age . . . " At last the little mare reached the top of the long hill where a side road to the cottage branched off . Far to the right , on the very last ridge visible , but at no great distance really , high above the lake , which you could not see , stood the now ' familiar square stone house , all alone , not a tree near it , outlinedon the summer sky . Both women glanced instinctively toward it as the little mare , sensing home , started out at a lively trot down the hill . " How different it looks now when you know what 's in it , " said Lottie . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was there but I never even thought of it . " " Now I remember reading about him somewhere . Was n't he married the first time to a French woman named . . . ? "  | " Yes , I remember that too . Then it was someone from Chicago . I wonder how many children he has ? " Suddenly her mother turned to the girl . " You 're a selfish woman . " Lottie was taken aback and said , " What are you talking about ? " " You take , take , take everything that is given you and you never give anything in return . " " What have I done now ? " said Lottie . " You 've always been that way and it 's about time somebodytold you . " The little mare slowed down to a walk , shying a little , as she always did when they were passing the ruins of a thirtyfoot-highlime kiln , so incongruously standing beside the road in the open fields . " You 'll never be a concert pianist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm lazy , " said Lottie . " What have you done since you came back from Germany ? I thought you were going to make a name for your-self . " " What do you think I am ? I 'm no genius . I ca n't go up to an agent and say , I 'm a concert pianist . Get me a booking . ' Maybe I 'll never get a booking . How do I know ? Just because I 've been to Germany does n't mean anything . " " Of course it means something . " " There are hundreds of young artists drifting around New York . Many of them are gifted . Does that get them in a concert hall ? The agencies are filled with them . I 'm just a beginner . You have to become known . " " How are you going to become known ? " " Well , you have to be good . Then you have to have a backer . Somebody with money . " " You ca n't find a backer if you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by refusing your opportunities . You have to be aggressive . It does n't matter if you do n't happen to like a man , you ca n't afford to be so fussy . When he wants to have you use his piano . . . "  | " Oh , so that 's it ? He 's a nobody . I never heard of him as a painter . " " How do you know ? Go and investigate . One thing leads to another . You will meet other people , people will get to know you , they will hear you play , they 'll talk about you . But you . . . " " Oh , you make me tired . " " Look at you . Gawky , hollow eyes , skinny legs . You look sick . You do n't take after my family . You do n't eat properly . Look at these farm girls , they have some stamina in them . But you . . . " " Oh Mother , why do n't you leave me alone ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some sense . We give you opportunities and what do you do with them ? Nothing . You do n't know how lucky you are . You do n't know how to improve yourself . What do you expect the world to do ? Fall at your feet ? You 've got to be ready . You 've got to be alert . When a famous artist wants to paint your portrait you should say , Yes , of course . ' But you act like a silly girl . No ! No ! Agh , you make me sick . " " All right , if he wants to paint my portrait he can paint it . Is that what you want ? I 'll be waiting for him tomorrow morning on the porch in a pretty dress as if he was going to take me to a party . I just ca n't wait for him . Is that what you want me to say ? " " Well , it 's about time you got some sense . " By then they were in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases from the carriage , laid them on the porch . Lottie helped her . Flossie , who was in the hammock by the brook with her little brother , came up to help also , but there was nothing to do , as Lottie drove the horse into the stable to unharness her . The brook was low just then and the little boy , barefooted , had been attempting to dam it where it was no more than an inch deep at the ford . With a small shovel he had piled up the sand between two flat stones until the water ,  |p298which  had more of a head than he knew , spreading out back of the obstruction , began to trickle off through the weeds into the stream again . There was an old fence rail with which he half-succeeded in blocking the weakness of his design there . But then the water had gone off in the opposite direction . His sister had helped him move two stones , which he was not able to roll over without her assistance , getting her shoes wet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them and after two leaps buried itself again in the mud at the stream bottom . Now the dam was completed , making a broad pool where , with a piece of broken shingle for a boat , the little fellow was playing . " What were you two so excited about ? " asked Floss , when her sister returned from the barn . " I could hear you from the corner of the lot . " " Ma got on her high horse about something I said and was giving me the devil . " " It sounded like it . " But since Lottie offered no further explanation , and went into the house to change her dress , Floss returned to her book in the hammock under the willows where heavy clouds piled up in the sky from the west and a chilly breeze began to sway the long green tendrils of the old trees . The little boy was delighted , as his ship , on which his sister had improvised a small sail with a bit of paper and hairpin , dashed madly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was furious the following Saturday when he heard what had been going on during the week . Nor was he pacified when Ives , his wife and the two little girls drove over on Sunday to make his acquaintance . " Do you know what you 've done ? " said he to his wife , when they were alone that night in the small cottage . The girls could hear them talking heatedly and surmised what it was about , though their words came indistinctly through the thin walls . Then he said something in German . " Any fool who calls himself an artist or lives in a big house . " Then , as Gurlie shushed him , his voice dropped to a lower pitch . After breakfast the following day when the livery man came to drive him to the early train , he went off without a word . Poor Joe . He was even more furious the following week when he returned to the cottage , having made inquiries about his artist neighbor , and found the record even worse than he thought . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crook . Ein Schwein . A good for nothing . " But by that time the damage had been done . Lottie had already sat for her portrait three times , had even taken little Paul with her for the last time , for a preliminary sketch , and the pattern of the summer was established.  |p300Meanwhile  Flossie had announced that she and her doctorfriend were finally to be married late that fall . So the days wore on happily enough and even Joe at last accepted , with resignation , his wife 's machinations . Lottie admired Dora , who in her turn accepted her as a frequent guest . For hours there would be complete silence from the studio as by the artist 's painstaking method the portraitslowly progressed , and no one could say that it was n't an outstanding piece of work . When Gurlie saw it for the first time : " Did you have to make the neck so low ? " she said . But aside from that she acknowledged that it was masterly . " Lottie has such a beautiful neck , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " He had in fact insisted , when Lottie had first come to sit for him , that she unfasten her dress and wear it low in front , to which she had only mildly objected . But he had come and pushed it down over her breasts so that their full beauty would be at least indicated . " Yes , it is well done , " said Gurlie . " Now , when you have finished that you must do one of my little boy . " As the summer wore on Lottie came regularly to pose or play by the hour upon the piano which was at her disposal . Little Paul 's portrait was being built simultaneously with her own : his blue eyes , his direct , proud look , high forehead and abundant mass of wavy blond hair , his straight little nose , full empurpled lips , highly colored cheeks and round chin . He was an exceptionally beautiful child whom Ives faithfully put down on the canvas with great skill and devotion until you melted to the man because of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist and a good one  --  and as a consequencerelaxed his instinctive opposition . When little Paul 's portrait was completed after the first month , it was presented to Gurlie by the artist and became her prized possession . But the picture of Lottie never left the studio . Ives acknowledged that portrait to be the best he 'd painted to date . " You 're positively inspired , " Dora would sayp301to him when , on Lottie 's arrival in the morning , they 'd be inspecting the previous day 's progress preliminary to what lay ahead . Lottie would beg her to stay and talk to her to relieve the monotony of posing and sometimes she 'd do it , often bringing with her the children 's hose to darn or alternating with a little dress from which the buttons had been lost , she 'd sit there watching her husband at his work . They talked of many things , of the future of the artist 's life in America and the misunderstandings with which , in a Puritan culture , it was still surrounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful it would be if they could see it together ! The French know the right value to put upon the apparent immorality of the artist 's way of thought . To know the profundities of life , at some point in one 's career one must let go , one must abandon one 's self completely to the full range of emotional shock . Only by ceasing to hold back , denying one 's self what is plainly there to be known , could one fully grasp what is to be learned from the artist 's canvas or sonata or poem . America is a maimed environment out of which nothing wide and broad enough in the artist 's experience could come to stand up against time . With this Lottie instinctivelyagreed . " You should know Oxford , England , where I was born and grew up , " Dora would say . And she 'd laugh . Ives , too , would laugh , but made no comment . " When he first dawned on my horizon it was to me like young Lochinvar come out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have followed him to the ends of the earth  --  and did , did n't I , darling ? He swept me right off my feet . " Ives would be painting doggedly as she rambled on while Lottie would be trying to hold a pose . " I knew all about him . My mother thought him a terrible person . My father was dead , you know . And nothing I could say could convince her . But I was in love , I suppose . And I was fed up with Oxford . It 's really a beastly place for a girl to grow up in . She senses , of course , that she is surrounded by what are probably thep302most brilliant minds of tomorrow but  --  you ca n't imagine how dull it is there for a young woman . They 're interested in each other , not in her . But there 's an atmosphere , for all that . It drove me to want to get away . So here I am . " Then she 'd put her sewing down at the call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the day . When Lottie would tire of posing she 'd play , play anything that came into her head while Ives would lie on the couch , place his hands back of his head and listen or suggest a new number ; get up , stand at the window or even at moments leave the studio while Lottie was still playing and let her have the place to herself . Afternoons , tea regularly would be served except on the days when little Paul would come . As it was always somewhat of a fight to get him there , she 'd have to go home earlier . Sometimes Ives would take the whole family for a long drive . , , through the back roads of the region and the ladies would put up a picnic lunch which they 'd eat at some beautiful vantage among the hills in the open fields or under broad trees . Lazy days ! The surface of events was hardly ruffled while Dora spoke of her coming visit to England the following year and Lottie dreamed of Europe again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of piano coaching in Berlin  --  Teresa Carreno , the great woman teacher , was her present choice . Time was passing , and if she was ever to make anythingof herself she would have to begin pretty soon . Altogetherthe acquaintance which had blossomed into their friendship and filled the summer for her so beautifully had been a most rewarding experience . " It has been very pleasant to have had you for a friend this summer . I ca n't tell you how much it has meant to me , " Dora had told her when the Stechers were about to leave their beloved cottage on Labor Day and return home . " It has meant so much to me  --  in more ways than I can say . " Well , you do n't need to put on so about it , Lottie had thought . I 've had a good time too.  | " Your portrait is lovely , " Dora continued . " I 'm sure Gregory must be very satisfied with it . " " You speak as if we were saying good-bye forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter . I insist . " " My husband , no doubt , but not me . It 's very difficult for me to get out of here in the winter . After that , England . England again ! " " Oh , but you 're coming back . " " Yes , but perhaps not here . It 's not very satisfactory a place for children . After they are of school age it will be worse . It 's a lovely place , though , is n't it ? I wonder often what will become of it . " " Do n't talk that way , " said Lottie . " I 'm sure we 'll all be together again next summer . " Prompted by his wife , Stecher had decided to purchase , for a bare three hundred dollars , an abandoned farm on the opposite side of town , to the east . It , was on a narrow dirt road two or three miles out among steeply rolling hills which effectivelyshut it in from all view save that of a shanty below it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The small , low building , dating from Revolutionary times , was badly run down and occupied by two shabby families living in indescribable filth . There was a well house , a tumble-down barn and fields hardly a foot of which showed any level ground . They had n't been cultivated for years and were covered with a thin stand of fox grass . The chestnut trees that had once dignified the area , filling the woods in the hollow and the " grove " back of the farm buildings , were all . blighted and doomed . Half of them were already gone and the rest would follow shortly . The narrow road went off to the east through a deep cut , steeply down over a culvert draining the swamp at the bottom . One of the things that had sold Joe the idea of purchasing the run-down place was that there , at the bottom of the hill , it would be quite easy to construct a dam by which to flood the three acres of swamp and make a lake of it for a swimming pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods to the north and , in the spring , ran pleasantly enough along to the small river in the far distance . It was called the old Smith farm and had about it the smell of dirt and poverty , of old rags and dampness in the cellar under the hand-hewn beams . But this in no way interfered with Gurlie 's roseate view of a future homestead . The squatters who occupied the place would be leaned out at once and carpenters brought in to make the roof tight for the winter ; the floors would be cleaned and scraped . What wonderful broad boards ! A toilet would be installed and in the spring they would move in . Ives , who had seen the farm and approved of its purchase , even went so far as to design for them a practical barn of fieldstone  --  which would be their first construction  --  beside a giant white oak back of the future garden in a dip of the land below the rear hill ; it was all hill ! Gurlie was delighted . She wanted stanchions for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three horses also . She would have pigs , chickens  --  a chicken coop would have to be built . A hundred and fifty acres ! Joe paced off the boundaries with the authorities , walking through thickets and brambles northward to the highest point of the land . It continued to rise at the back through heavily wooded area belonging to the next farm , then came back down across the saddle where the road lay , then up again to a stone wall faced by scraggly hedge to the extreme south where there were ten acre fields , side by side on the road , graced by a copse of white birches in the one farthest west . Joe liked the place . It had no frank brook , but it was surrounded by water on all sides . What he particularly enjoyedwas the woods and the isolation . There was no one around except on the farm of old Weigant , a Dutch descendant of better times , over the hill to the west . Joe went down and made the acquaintance of the old Dutchman , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent sons who looked at him as much as to ask , What the hell do you want up inp305this country ? Joe told Weigant he 'd bought the Smith place for a summer residence and that one way or another he might want to build a house there some day . Weigant said he 'd been a stonemason when he was younger , and though he 'd gained a lot of weight as he 'd come along and had a weak back , he thought that he could still do a day 's work if it came right down to it . Joe had flushed a few pheasants on his walk around the place , and found some old apple trees full of fruit , a Northern Spy and a Baldwin , together with the usual sweet summer apple at the corner of the kitchen garden . He made up his mind that fruit and game would be plentiful . The die was cast  --  Gurlie would at last have a place in the country , not more than fifty miles from New York and in a beautiful spot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in such a way that it would be fit for cultivation , it was picturesque , and the soil , where you could find a few level acres , was of the richest . A farmer of the neighborhood , one Charlie Carpenter , was forthwith hired to come for the summer , the barn was commissioned , carpenters and plumbers were loosed on the old building , and when the Stechers had returned and settled down in Riverdale again all their friends began to hear about it . But the wedding of Flossie to her doctor was first to be attended to . It was September now . In December they planned to take the big leap and already were beginning to draw up a list of the guests to be invited . A disagreement occurred at the start . Lottie wanted to invite Ives . Flossie said no . " It is my wedding and I 'll have whom I please . " But Gurlie highhandedly went over her head and Ives was invited . Dora could n't leave the children . Nothingcould be done about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private box at the local post office for her business mail as a potential concert pianist . The preparations for the wedding occupied the whole fall season . The young doctor , naturally , took no part in them ,  |p306being  mere accessory before the fact . As far as he was concerned , it was of little significance other than that in three years , or two years , really , he had got to the point where he had saved enough cash to make it seem possible for him to begin to support a wife . In the two years since he had returned from Germany ( where he had witnessed the first zeppelin flights in the mists above Leipzig ) Floss and he had got to know each other pretty thoroughly . All but every night of the week they had grown more and more intimate in the small , darkened parlor of her parents ' house  --  escape as they were able from the persistent attentions of the small brother . He liked the " doc " and the " doc " liked him . Sometimes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change devote the evening to him rather than to their own affairs . It was a harrowing time in all , but the young couple were devoted to each other . And it was an exhausting time . They were both drawn , pale and holloweyedas the engagement drew at last to a close . It was a cold , clear evening in December . Floss , whose father trusted her , had put everything into her hands . The coaches were engaged ; a list of those to be called for was , placed in the liveryman 's hands ; the bridal party was ready to be taken to the church when it was discovered that at the last minute Joe , fearing that Floss might have been too busy to look after the details , had countermanded everything and given new orders for the disposition of the coaches . Result , complete confusion , everyone running in the wrong direction and worst of all , one of the ministers  --  there were to be two taking part in the ceremony  --  was forgotten . The groom , contemptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridal party was in the portico of the church . The minister had not arrived . Knowing that the cere mony could not go on without him , the groom absented himself from his place until the minister finding herself  --  it was a woman  --  waiting for the coach , called a cab and got to the church at the last minute.  |p307Floss  , pale as a ghost , walked up the aisle on her father 's arm , as the young physician , full of sympathy for what he knew must be her state of mind , smilingly waited . Thus they were married. ' 1The Stecher household was ablaze with lights . Champagnewas the sole drink . The champagne punch was particularlystrong and , by the time the bride and groom were about to leave , the party had become wild . Some of the girls were dizzy to a point of drunkenness and long afterward remembered the event as the highlight of the season , if not their lives . Ives and Charlotte were forgotten in the melee , but when , in a shower of serpentines , rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , they found it roped against them . It had been Ives 's idea . But in a moment Charlie 's friends rallied to his rescue , cut the ropes , and let the couple go.  |p308All  during the summer Flossie was carrying her first child . There were rumors of war , though no one believed it really possible . Gurlie 's dream of an estate to be named Alverheim after the ancestral home of her forebears was taking shape and Dora Ives was getting ready to quit her Monroe home for England to visit her parents . She did n't think she would ever return to that particular location in the American hinterland ; it was too lonesome . Ives had decided to put it on the market . Gurlie bought his wild black horse and various miscellaneouskitchen items as well as a tall Normandy clock , with the proviso that he could buy it back from her at some future time should he want it . A great argument went on about the small house on the Smith farm , whether to keep its classic American lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central wing and putting in modern conveniences or to rebuild it from cellar to roof . Whenever Flossie and her husband come up for a week-end , the argument would become especially heated . He stood out for keeping the old building intact  --  save for making it habitable  --  untilGurlie one day lost her temper and flew at him on the pretext of his suggesting a row of whitewashed stones to mark the carriage entrance for night use . Gurlie let him have it , " What do you think I am ? " shep309said . " This is no poor farm . I am proud , I am . We do n't want to live like these white trash of the mountains . " " If it comes to that , " he lashed back at her , " I 'm proud , too . But not about the things you are . " When the barn was finished , twelve head of cattle were installed there under Charlie Carpenter , who had already plowed one of the fields of the west hill . He planted it with corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fall , measured fourteen feet from root to tassel . He took an armful of the stalks and stood them against the front of the house for all passers-by to witness . The garden wall to the left of the house was rebuilt , steps were re-established leading to the area above it , and a dozen hybrid lilacs were planted along its crest , a fifty-foot hedge that took hold in the rich soil and grew phenomenally . Back of that , and the house itself , lay the kitchen garden , a hundred feet long and fifty wide . An asparagus bed was laid out and planted , thirty rhubarb roots were put in , that , within a single season , produced enough juicy stalks to supply a regiment . A strawberry bed and a raspberry patch were installedand also loganberries . Of the annuals such as eggplant , carrots , beets and three sorts of lettuce , parsley  --  whatever could be thought of  --  there was enough for a family ten times the size of the one it supplied . What soil ! A bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer . Gurlie made dandelion wine from the succulent and overwhelming masses of that goldenfloweredweed which grew on every side . In the old orchard across the road , part of the purchase , the grass was thick with wild strawberry . Quarts and quarts were picked and preserved . Once the young doctor and Flossie , roaming the far fields back of the woods above the eastward low ground , came upon a patch better than any they had found heretofore . They noted it and went back the next day with pails , but someone had been there before them . The grass was trampled and the berries were gone.  |p310It  was probably the mountain people who had moved into a filthy shack which Weigant let them occupy on the road across from the Stechers ' low ground . Their sore-eyed , ragged children , never speaking , were often to be seen furtively lurkingabout their trampled domain . The twelve tuberculin-tested Holsteins meant the installationof new fences . One of the Weigant boys was engaged to help with the milking . He was a gangling , long-jawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly reliable . There was a good market for the milk at the local cheese factory , which gave a certain authority to Gurlie 's plans . The manure began to pile up in the barnyard . This , too , was encouraging ; it was just what the fields needed in the spring . But the state inspectors were n't long in putting in an appearancerecommending the screening of the stable windows , the installation of a cooling system and better facilities for the care of the milker 's cleanliness . This made Gurlie mad . Joe hated the cows . From the first they would break out of their enclosure and go trooping across the lawn . Two little English walnut trees that he had planted either side in front of the cottage had to be especially protected when one day they all but disappeared down one of the beasts ' gullet . The doctor again rashly suggested that they connect the lower field , where the cows mostly were set out , with the upper yard by way of a lane , a narrow fenced-in approach across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars at the bottom of the hill , the cows could by themselves come up near the barn for the milking instead of having to be driven along the road  --  with all the attendant wandering about , getting into the gardenor running clean away . But Gurlie again opposed herself . She wanted the front field to be beautiful . Ultimately it would front the mansion . She did n't want to turn it into a runway for cattle . And when Gurlie was opposed to any common-sense suggestion , she was so violent , so insulting , that everyone began to hate her . Once she caught Charlie Carpenter , at the end of the day ,  |p311with  a two-quart can of milk in his hand just as he was leaving . " Where are you going with that milk ? " she asked him . " Taking it to my cousin . " " Who told you to do that ? " " Nobody . They have n't got any cow now and with all their younguns they can use it . You got more here than 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing , " said Gurlie . " No ma'am . That ai n't stealing , " said Charlie . " Everybodyhereabouts lets the help have all the milk they want . " " Well you ca n't do it to me , " said Gurlie . " All right ma'am , I ai n't coming back , " said Charlie . And he did n't . And then Gurlie really found herself in a bad way , dependent on the Weigant boy until she could hire anotherfarmer . She did get a good farmer , though , a Magyar , a very cocky one , who spoke with a strong foreign accent . One day after he 'd been there a few weeks the colored cook whom Gurlie had brought up for the summer baked him some delicious corn muffins . Joe , the farmer , ate one and enjoyed it . Julia was doing the ironing while he was at breakfast . " What are those little cakes you gave me ? They 're good , " said Joe . " Those are corn muffins , " Julia told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " said Julia . " Fit for pigs , " cried Joe . And he spit out what he had in his mouth onto the floor . Julia picked up the hot iron and flew at him . " You get out of my kitchen , " she yelled at him , " or I 'll sear your face ! " The man got up as if the devil was after him and flew out the door , Julia after him . He would n't come into the house from that time on until he had looked to see that the coast was clear . He cooked and ate his own meals outdoors from then on.  |p312The  new heating system with its big hot-air furnace nearly filled the old cellar under its low hand-hewn beams . It was an enormous affair with one top vent which came out through the floor of the large front room so that when the heat was on you could hardly stand it . But it kept the place livable in the cold weather . All the hillsides about the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were planted with young fruit trees , peaches , plums , pears and apples of four or five kinds , hundreds of them . " What in God 's name are you doing ? " Gurlie was asked . " You 'll have more fruit out here than you can ever harvest . " " There 's always a good market for fruit in New York State . " " But who 's going to spray them and pick them ? " " Agh , what do you know about farming ? " was her reply , and like as not the answer would have to be , " Nothing . " That Gurlie herself knew little about farming never seemed to occur to her . She had a complicated , turreted pig-pen of sharp stone pieces built at a distance from the buildings at the bottom of the hill in the edge of the woods . " But who 's going to bring them their slops ? " As Joe once said to a friend , " Do you know how to make money out of a farm ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " confided Joe , speaking in a loud guttural stage whisper back of his hand . But Gurlie had them build a stone smoke house at the edge of the isolated grove which was Joe 's favorite spot . A chicken coop and fenced-in yard where a hundred hens had to be fed was another feature . More than once the young doctor had to drive into town in the buggy where the grain merchant dumped a bag of cracked corn into the back . It was gone in a week . The merchants of the town were only too glad , finding Joe a prompt payer , to give him all the credit he wanted . He planted young fir trees of all sorts about the hillsides ,  |p313larches  , balsams , white pine and spruce , and all of them took hold and grew like mad . It promised in a measurable time to be one of the show places of the region , as Gurlie boasted it would be , as long as Joe was able and willing to foot the bills . Water , as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old well was inadequate , the water , besides , not safe to use . You could see the surface of it far down . Charlie Carpenterhad daily lowered the milk cans into it to chill them at the beginning of his tenure , but you could n't keep that up . There was even a sort of cupboard there for butter and other perishablesand it served well , too , but in the end something more serviceable had to be provided . So the drillers appeared in mid-summer and began their operations . First they went down under the hump of the hill back of the barn and the big oak where gravity would carry what they found into the buildings which lay all below . They got some water , too , close to the surface but it was n't good water , and there was n't much of it . So they had to go deeper , beyond the five hundred-foot mark and there they found a good supply , but it was too strongly alkaline , unsuited for domestic use . Finally , abandoning that site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty feet deep , at the very bottom of the hill approaching the bottomland , walled it in with loose stone , installed an electric pump and solved the problem . It was an expensive operation , but inescapable . The cows were at least properly supplied . Then there was the ice house , under the hill near the old house . The site had been used for the same purpose in former years , but the buildings had gone to rot . The ice from a nearby pond could be hauled in and up a short incline to the top of the ridge where the ice blocks could be slid in from the top until the virtually underground cubicle was packed full to the roof . But at the front , facing the barn and the house , the ice house presented at the base a bolted door out of which the sawdust-coveredice hunks could be drawn as needed . The icep314lasted all summer . The young doctor , who knew nothing of farms , was impressed . Young Paul , while all this was going on , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that isolated spot , had been sent away to a boys ' camp . As that first summer advanced , it became apparent to everyone that the location was ideal as a place to which a New York businessman and his family could retire for relaxationand the enjoyment of the beauties of nature in summer . Joe was perfectly happy there week-ends . On Sundays he 'd sit on the narrow little porch , facing the old orchard , smoke his cigar and note with perfect tranquillity how the phoebe , unfrightened under the edge of the porch roof , continued to feed her fledgling within six feet of his idle hand . He had , planted clematis , which from the first had grown luxuriantly , twining itself up the lattice columns to his right and his left . He had acquired a mongrel pup that as it grew became his staunch friend and companion , a typical short-tailed yellow dog , powerful in build , and death to the woodchucks that infested the stone walls on every side . Those stone walls interested Gurlie for their antiquity and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring home a shell-incrusted piece of rock which would be put aside for the building of future fireplaces . But the grove above the barn was Joe 's particular retreat . When of a Sunday after he had explored the acreage to its remotestcorner with Mike at his side , he 'd come to the grove where a hammock had been swung , light up a cigar , and , his dog at his feet , doze off , for a delicious hour . He had cleaned up the grove , grown over with huckleberryand wild azalea , largely by his own hand , and enjoyed it , gradually picking up the stones lying about , as many as he could move , and making a neat pile of them . This " fortress " he named , after the legendary resting place of the Prussian State Treasurer , Spandau . Everyone knew that that pile of rocks was his private keep . It got to be ten feet around and asp315high as your head , neatly piled , as he would do it , the stones fitted all about like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he 'd say , with his ironic smile and one never knew quite what he meant . From all parts of the farm , the front porch , the grove , the high field back of the orchard , you had a view of the ridge of low mountains upon the peak of which stood the low-lying stone mansion of the late railroad tycoon who within a year of building it had died . As the farm faced due south the Scorpion on clear nights was the outstanding constellation visible in the summer sky . The whole valley with this high limiting ridge capped by the sight of wealth in the distant background seemed to give Joe a peculiar satisfaction and it was evident that he enjoyed it . The four little attic rooms , with angled ceilings to conform to the slope of the roof on either side , were seldom unoccupied that summer . They were hot , summer nights , and unquestionablythe few mosquitoes there could be very annoying . The beds were still primitive , though all that would be corrected later , but a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All were enthusiastic about the site , the wonderful view down the valley to the southward and the rolling fields with patches of forest to right and to left . At the end of August , little Paul , now grown to be a strong young fellow of thirteen , returned from his camp , brown and healthy . He , like his father , liked to roam the woods and fields and often , like his father , he 'd take a gun with him , either a light-weight rifle or the twelve-gauge shotgun which was always standing back of the kitchen door . He was a good shot and had been taught to handle a gun so that he had free use of it . His favorite spot was the stand of white birches at the western corner of the farm where the road came in from the town . There were plenty of rabbits there and the birds seemed to like it . He was pretty good . Once he came home with a woodcock , a bird not easy to bring down.  |p316The  family hated to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the finest time of the year , " Gurlie protested , " and we have to go home ! Well , it wo n't be for long . As soon as we get the house built and everything organized , we 're going to move up here permanently , " she said to her husband , " and live here . I 've met some fine people already  --  and there are lots more . Rich people , too . You never hear of them , but they 're the best people in the country . " Joe had no objection , except he always added , " Yes , if we do n't go broke first . " But Gurlie would laugh , and that , to all intents and purposes , would settle it . But it was beautiful ! The maples before the house were all crimson and the two hickory trees above the cut in the road were pure gold while a tupelo in the stone wall at the edge of the old orchard was the most brilliant of all , its enameled leaves alternately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alder with goldenrod in the fields in the foreground seemed veritably speaking with pathos , inanimate things that they were , turned vocal with the end of the year . Apples hung unpicked in the trees , red and russet . The ground was covered with them . What can you do ? There was a cider press , but little use was made of it ; the old white horse had eaten all the apples that were good for him ; the rest just had to rot . The broken-down utility house across the road just below the farm , its roof stove in , its stone walls down on three sides , the rest overgrown with poison ivy so that no one went near it , was just one year closer to final collapse . Joe , the farmer , was left alone in charge at last for the winter . The family was driven to the station and that year was at an end . Sibp317All during the latter days of December they waited for the pains to begin . On Christmas Day they started . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Borden was about to be called , they subsided and the Christmas festivities took over . " So we 're not to have a little Christ child after all . " On New Year 's Day it was the same routine : at dawn the cramps , Flossie thought that this time the baby would surely come , but again everything quieted down . " He 's an accommodatinglittle bastard , " said the young doc , " he does n't want to interfere with the festivities . More power to him . " There had been no snow that year . " He 'll come with the first snowfall , " said Floss . Sure enough , she was awakened by the now familiar pains at dawn on the seventh of January of the fateful year 1914 : it was gently snowing . This time she knew it would go through . Dr. Borden was summoned , arrived promptly , and laid out his kit . Now the pains were severe . Her husband was to give Flossie the chloroform , but when they went to look , Borden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young doctor have any more than ten or fifteen drops in the bottom of his last remaining one-ounce bottle . It was five in the morning ; no pharmacy was open . What to do ? " You might know it , " said Floss . " The doctor 's wife al/ways has to get the worst of it . How could you be so careless ? " A drop at a time , he nursed the precious liquid , giving her the barest minimum in the failing attempt to make her comfortablewhile both he and she sweated it out . Finally , distracted , he was down to the last drop . He glanced up at the older man . Then he heard a cry , a new cry ! He dropped the empty chloroform bottle . " What is it ? " " A boy , " said the older man casually . " A boy ! " " A boy ? " said Floss drunkenly . The new father wanted to make sure he had heard right . Yes , a boy ! Tears came to his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hair . For the next exciting minutes the two doctors were silently occupied in their competentmaneuvers , properly disposing of the infant and caring for the new mother to insure her safety- and comfort . Thus the new year started , with a male firstborn to the two sets of grandparents . Lottie and little Paul came and looked at the baby and approved . Joe came and presented Floss with a check for a hundred dollars to start a bank accountin the baby 's name . Gurlie came and took the baby in her arms to inspect it carefully to see if it was a worthy descendantof Vikings and , having approved , put it down and forgot it . But Lottie was restless . She was not getting on as fast as she thought she should with her concerts , and though she played well , there was lacking that final distinction which she knew  --  she best of all  --  she must have to be a stand-out performerin her field . She had talked to her mother . " I need a year 's coaching under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil of someone with the prestige to get me heard , someone like Teresa Carreno . " " Where is she ? " " In Berlin . "  | " In Berlin ? I do n't know whether your father will consent to let you do that . " " For a year , just one year , " pleaded Lottie . " In a year I 'll know whether I can do it or not . But I want a chance . If I could go to Germany for a year and study under a master , and I think I 'd like it to be a woman  --  if I could get Father to pay my expenses for one year  --  if I do n't show signs of becoming a successful pianist in that time I 'd be willing toquit . " " Then what will you do ? " " Teach . Please , please talk to Father for me . It wo n't cost much . And I 'll work like the devil . I ca n't do it here . I have to go abroad , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone important , someone with a name . " " Ask him yourself , " said Gurlie . " He 'll just yell at me . Why ca n't you work here ? But you ask your father . " " I 'm afraid , " said Lottie . And Gurlie did ask her husband for this final gesture for his eldest , his unmarried child 's establishment in a career . The result was an explosive " No ! " Nevertheless Lottie had been encouraged by her mother 's breaking the ice . " Oh , Papa , " she pleaded , " let me go . I 'll work as no one ever did before . Prices in Europe are not like they are here . Give me one last chance . I 'll pay it all back to you as soon as I get working , every cent of it . It is desperately important to me now . " " Why do n't you quit all this nonsense ? " was her father 's reply . " You 'll never be a great artist . How old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that 's too late . You 've been loafing around playing for these nincompoops in a little town like this ever since you came back from Leipzig . You 're not serious , not the way a great artist is serious . " " That 's not true . " " Of course it 's true . In Germany when a man wants to be a world-beater , he eats his profession , he sleeps it , makes him/self a slave to it  --  for years , he begins when he is a baby . But you Americans ! Loafers ! You 'd rather go to little parties and eat ice cream . You do n't know how to work , to work ! How do you think a man gets to be an outstanding performer ? Work ! That 's what it takes , devotion to his craft . You do n't know what that means . To you the piano is just a plaything . " Nevertheless , as the months passed , perhaps out of disgust , if not from the innate optimism of a spring season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling his paternal expectations , the " farm " constantly in his thoughts  --  he consented . Lottie was elated . She was a new girl , excited , blossoming as if she were going to the arms of a bridegroom . Her whole life was transformed . Berlin ! was the refrain that carried her , Berlin ! Berlin ! You might think it was heaven . One month more , she dreamed ! At the end of March , rumors or no of the warlike state of international affairs , she would be gone . She promised anything and everything-that it would not be for long , that as soon as she saw how things were shaping up , what progress she was able to make , if it were not good , that if she had not succeeded in a year she 'd throw the whole thing up . She swore on her immortal soul that in such a case she would toss the whole thing overboard and return home . That would be the end , come what may , her father would have no further expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sailing from Hoboken on the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse they had a big party for her  --  at some smorgasbord in New York . It was a wonderful party . Everyonewas there , all her girlfriends , all her old lovers who were still unattached and able to say good-bye to the charming young woman , Flossie and her husband , everyone . And when Joe threw a party it was a party , everything of the best and everyone was happy , in a hilarious mood wishing the young woman bon voyage . " See you next year ! " op.  | " Going to get married over there , to some Heinle ? " " What ? Do n't be ridiculous ! " " I 'll bet it 'll be some American you meet on the boat ! I 'll bet you a hundred to one . " Lottie did n't have time to reply , but turned to speak to one of the girls who pretended to be sniffling . " I wish you all the luck in the world , darling , I really do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure , as her father handed her the check on which she was to live for the first months , holding it by one end , she the other , he said , " Well , Charlotte , work hard . " " I will . " He hesitated a moment , " Are you going to see that sucker Ives while you are in Europe ? " She returned his look , straight in the eye and said to him , " Of course not . Do n't be ridiculous . " A week later when the vessel docked at Hamburg , she walked straight into Ives 's arms and he carried her off to bed . That was the end of her plans . As soon as it was practicable they were married . Oh happy , happy pair ! They decided that for the moment they would not return to America . It was his fourth or fifth marriage , and of course her first . When the news reached America , Joe , who had considerableinfluence in New York business circles , tried to keep it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppression : " Affinity Ives ' does it again . Daughter of prominent New York businessman , " etc . In spite of all Joe could do it came out , anyway , and everyone knew it . Joe was beside himself . He raved at Gurlie for her part in the affair , blamed her for the whole thing , and since something had to be said to the reporters who thronged their home even to the point of being found roaming unbid in the upstairs rooms in search of a photo of Lottie , wild with anger that he had been so duped he branded Ives a " moral leper "  --  and that hurt . That , too , was broadcast . Even the newly wedded couple in Germany heard of it . A " moral leper , " that 's how he stig/matized him . His daughter he disowned , said she was not his daughter , never had been ; that he had adopted her when she was an infant  --  and indeed she did not resemble either Gurlie or himself ; threw her out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had always feared she would become , married a New York degenerate , known for his degeneracy . He did a thorough job . Poor Joe , he did n't bow his head , but looked defiantly at his friends , as though daring them to accuse him . But his heart was lower than his shoes . Pride kept Gurlie alert . " Maybe your own daughter will do it some day . Do n't talk to me , " she said to them . In her own mind she had the consolation of knowing that Ives had money and could take good care of his women . " She can look after herself , " she assured some of the most persistent inquirers . " You do n't have to worry about her . " But Gurlie now began to talk seriously of getting out of Riverdale , of selling the attractive little house she had lived in for those last happy years and moving bag and baggage to the country . How attractive it seemed there now with ' the opening season ! Joe 's friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last meeting of their beloved Fortnightly Reading Club , elected him president for the coming year . He tried to refuse , but no one would hear of it . " I do n't want anyone to feel sorry for me , " he protested to his wife . " I 'll resign . I refuse . " But in the end he thought better of it and let them make him their president . Early in June the family moved to the farm where the new life was to begin . Reminders of the elder daughter 's romancewere all about him , the final indignity being that Ives , when he had broken up his own home the year before to go abroad again , had sold Gurlie many of his lesser possessions . " Oh well , that was ended now . " Little Paul went back to his camp of the year before , both for his own happiness in the companionship of boys his ownp323age and the convenience of having him out of the way while the work of constructing at the farm was going forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godsend now to Gurlie and her husband . How everything had thrived ! It was a veritable miracle , the eternal miracle of the soil . When they first went up there that spring , near the southeast wall of the house close against the boards , a row of dwarf purple iris was in full bloom . " What can you do before such beauty but let your heart be softened ? " The dandelions were luxuriant , the individual blossoms two inches across made a thick carpet that crept in everywhere even to the very stones of the farmhouse steps . Violets ! It was as if nothing had occurred to ruffle the spirit of a man . It was a new , a flaming new world . The cherry trees , a small orchard of a dozen trees on the sharp slope beside the ice house were a mass of blossoms purply white , a solid mass upon the trees . The apple trees , the peach trees , the plums were leaping with the forces of fertility within them . But the lilacs  --  why , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purple , of three shades , single and double , while the odor of them was overwhelming to the senses . Gurlie forgot herself in that odor which she loved as she loved no other benefice of the year . Joe , alone with his thoughts , whatever they were , took his long walks as usual about the property . He would come back , his boots muddy , his cheeks aglow , have his Sunday dinner , eat well , then doze in the sunshine on the small front porch . He measured the growth of the clematis that grew up the lattice pillars each side of him and seemed to be forgetting his recent discomfiture completely . Typical of him , he engaged his son-in-law 's brother , the architect , to design the new house . That it was to be a pretentiousone soon became evident . For when Fred presented to him the preliminary sketch of a rustic Black Forest lodge , thinking that that would be in keeping with the taste of thep324owner and fit as well the hilltop to which it would conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No ! I do n't want a peasant 's house built of logs ! I want a stone house , something solid that will last for years . " She laughed scornfully at the idea . " What do you think I am ? I do n't want that ! " And Joe agreed with her . So the architect was packed off to try again . Flossie and her husband brought the baby up week-ends . It afforded wonderful siestas for her , a rest from the busy life a doctor 's wife must lead , a perfect place where she could park herself with a small baby and enjoy it . And then in the middle of it all came the news that Germanyhad invaded Belgium and a shocked world realized that the famous Pax Brittanica was at an end at last . In the very truth , as Lord Grey phrased it , " The lights were going out all over Europe . " It was something that at first you could not believe , Joe could n't believe it . He could not believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not believe that his own Vaterland , close to his heart , had been the aggressor . He loved his fatherland despite the fact that he had renounced it , willingly , to take his place beside the rest of those who had come here across the seas to dedicate themselves to a better , a more democratic country . England was the culprit , England had forced Germany 's hand . Must that enlightened country , leader of the world in philosophic thought , in music , in medical research , chemical advance , must they be forced to ask England every morning for their very cup of breakfast coffee ? Unthinkable . Joe blamed England for it all and so long as the United States was neutral , he stoutly and openly voiced his opinions . " Germany will win , " he said , and with the success of its arms in the early months it looked as if Paris would soon be overrun . But he was not a subject of the Kaiser , he was a United States citizen . He scorned disloyalty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British publisher tried top325bribe him into giving up the entire floor that his printing establishmentoccupied on Hudson Street for English propagandapurposes . His lease protected him there , and the Britisher had to seek another location . But he was heartbroken over the events taking place , as was every sane man in the world . He refused to speak of the war with his friends , and deeply resented the implication that by favoring Germany he was in any way disloyal to the United States . He wandered his acres as usual , in fact , the farm became more and more the focus of his thoughts . With him the powerfulMike , the English sheep dog Tip , followed by little Tootsie the dachshund , its stumps of legs trying to keep up with its longer-legged companions , wandered over the fields of a weekendplanning a time when he could move bag and baggage to his place in the country and there , when he could retire from business , pass the final years of his life in comfort and peace . Threat of war or no , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August drew to a close , little Paul , now not so little , but approaching his fourteenth birthday , his camp having ended its season , came to the farm for a last fling before returning to Riverdale and school . He was a big boy now , in the pink of health , sunburned from his summer long outdoor life , his very hair sunburned . Full-blooded and eager to get out from under the more or less confining camp restrictions , his gun on his shoulder , he wandered the fields in search of a woodcock , partridge , pheasant or rabbit . His favorite place was across the road , into the hollow , among the beeches and oaks where a little stream ran full of water cress among the summer-worn skunk cabbages and scrubby willows . A covey of half-grown partridges had been more , than once flushed in that undergrowth and rabbits , seldomgiving you a decent shot , were known to inhabit it . That day he had been gone for a good part of the morning . Returning toward noon he went around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came out at the topp326of the cut opposite which the cows were usually pastured . All the old fences , that side of the road , had long since been down and the grass was long as he came to the edge of the embankmentand was about to descend . His gun in his hand , he could not have noticed the strand of old rusty wire hidden there close to the ground . It tripped him and he fell headlong down the sharp slope dropping his gun which started to slide muzzle forward over the rubble behind him.  |p327Robert  , Julia 's boy , was the first to hear it , a shotgun blast not a hundred feet away from where he was sitting idling on the kitchen steps , followed by a shout , " I 'm shot ! " Robert yelled to his mother in the house as he sprinted toward the sounds . When the women got there little Paul was on his feet at the roadside , but it was apparent that something serious had happened . The gun sliding down the embankment behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs . He was bleeding profusely . No use to speak of safety catches , of the wisdom of allowingchildren to be free with firearms . The two women and the boy Robert carried the poor child to the house as best they could and , not daring to touch him , laid him , clothes and all , upon blankets and a clean sheet on the floor of the living room . He was conscious and silent . They were a mile and a half from the next farm where there was a telephone . Weigant had none . The old white horse was the only means of communication . Robert , bareback , though he did not know how to ride , headed downhill to the west as fast as he could urge his mount to go . Finally , getting to the Bull farm , he told them what had occurred . Mrs. Bull , an intelligent woman , summoned an ambulance , heavens knows where , but not nearby and , callingp328her husband from the barn , got into her car and went to the Stecher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do . The first thing that Flossie and Charlie knew of it was when in the early afternoon they received a phone call from Gurlie that little Paul had been accidentally shot ; to call Joe in New York and to come up to the farm as fast as they could . The baby was disposed of and the young couple , getting into their Ford runabout , forced it to its top speed over the pitted roads on the forty-mile run . No details had been given . They only knew that the boy had been injured and badly . They called Joe at once and told him to come along by train without delay . When they had gone past Tuxedo , thirty miles on their way , Charlie saw Gurlie in a car going in the opposite direction . She was beckoning wildly for them to turn about and follow her . He guessed they were bound for the hospital at Tuxedo , an excellent one , where the young doctor knew there was a capable surgeon in attendance . Gurlie had by then disappeared . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got to the hospital in leaping out of his car , Flossie behind him , and going up the stairs to the operating-room floor where he knew the boy must be . They had just finished the emergency job . The boy was back in his bed , recovering from the ether . " Hello , Doc , " he said weakly to his brother-in-law . Charlie patted him gently on the head and told him to go to sleep . In the dressing room the surgeon was just taking off his gown . " How is he ? " The old man shook his head . " Better if he dies , " he said . " He 's terribly hurt . If he lives , he 'll be a cripple . Boys that age should never be trusted with guns . " And he turned his back and finished taking off his operating clothes . But Charlie could not stay for that . The women , whop329had not been admitted to the operating suite , were waiting outside . They eagerly accosted him , " Is he all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he 's still alive . Let him rest . " Then they thought of Joe coming on the express from New York . It was due in Tuxedo in a matter of minutes . Charlie ran for it just as it was coming into the station . Stecher , of course , did not know that his son was at that place , so the young doctor had to board the front car and run through hoping to see him , if indeed he had caught the train and was aboard . He found him in the last car , got him quickly to his feet and off the train before it started again , and up to the hospital which was close at hand , and to the boy 's bed as fast as it could be done . The boy was awake and as his father came up to him , smiled and said , " Hello , Pop . " " Hello , son , " said the unhappy man . Then Charlie beckoned him away and took him out to the women . Returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse put her fingers to her lips . He was dead . The young doctor walked wearily into the presence of the waiting relatives and told them without hesitation , " He 's gone . " Stecher 's shoulders collapsed , he shrank together , bowed his head , and you could see that all the fight had gone out of him . He was a beaten man . The funeral was a pathetic affair . Fortunately , it was the end of summer so that it was a simple matter to close the farm and move back to Riverdale . That , at least , following the familiar pattern , made it a little easier to bear . But he was gone , that energetic , that intelligent , that handsome young boy , so admired by all and so loved and planned for by Gurlie and his father . He had been wiped out , had vanished from their lives just at the moment when it seemed as if every promise that a child could show was to be realized . But the war was there , life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
