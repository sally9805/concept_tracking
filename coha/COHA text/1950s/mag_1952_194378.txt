The citizens of France 's bustling , southern city of Nimes ( pop . 75,398 ) were every bit as proud of their local opera house as Belgium 's aging ex-Prima Donna Eva Closset was of her protg , Jos Fas . Nimes 's playhouse , built in 1798 , is billed as " the oldest theater of its kind " with no attempt to define its kind ; Eva 's protg was her favorite nephew . The theater and Jos were brought together last June when Eva sent a circular letter to every opera manager in France , proclaiming Jos 's brilliance and immediate availability as a tenor . Francis Lenzi , Nimes 's entrepreneur , took a chance and wrote back offering Jose a job in the chorus . <P> Last week , as Eva beamed , Jos romped and roared through several performances of Halvy 's La Juive , Bizet 's Les Pcheurs de perles and Delibes ' Lakm .

She went back to her hotel room and downed three large glasses of heady red wine . Then she tucked a bottle of alcohol from her spirit stove in her wrap and stole back to the theater . " Just picking up my stepson 's things , " she told the doorman as she entered . The doorman nodded sleepily , and Eva slipped backstage . She slopped the alcohol over some newspapers and jammed the sodden mess in among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four hours later , all that was left of " the oldest theater of its kind " were four walls and a few Greek columns . <P> " I did it for you , darling , " sobbed Eva to Jos in the police station next day .
