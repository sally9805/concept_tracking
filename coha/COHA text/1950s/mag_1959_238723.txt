" I do n't want to sound like a Pollyanna , " said a steelman last week , " but so far , everything is going better than we dreamed it could . " With its 500,000-man labor force back on the job , the nation 's steel industry was making an amazing comeback . Barely a week after the first furnaces were fired up again , the mills were up to 45.9% of capacity , and turning out 1,300,000 tons of steel . This week output should be clipping along at better than 60% , well ahead of the first estimates . <P> Republic Steel Corp . hit 70% this week , some five weeks ahead of earlier predictions ; U.S. Steel* is also coming fast , will have some plants up to 85% production by next week . Inland expects 80% capacity this week , while Jones &; Laughlin , Wheeling Steel , Armco , Allegheny Ludlum hope to hit between 65% and 80% . Throughout the industry , steelmen are cashing in on the care they took in shutting down their furnaces and in keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraction of the expected repairs proved to be necessary . <P> <P> " Human Nature Is Queer . " Another big factor was the attitude of the steelworkers . Though some unions posted signs saying : " We shall return as slaves of Ike , " and issued armbands emblazoned : " U.S.W. of A.-Ike 's Slaves , " the men were ready to work hard . U.S. Steel and others reported the workers ' attitude " excellent . " Said a foreman at Detroit 's Great Lakes Steel : " Human nature is queer . There is n't any love feast between the workers and the company , but the guys in the plant have lots of pride and self-respect ; they want to do a good job . " <P> No matter how fast ingot production climbs back , best estimates are that it will be several weeks before finished steel products are moving from the mills ; the cold-rolled sheet , needed by Detroit 's auto industry , will not be available for another two or three weeks . U.S. Steel estimates that its shipments of finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts that many mills can top that figure . <P> Nevertheless , the prospect of a faster flow of steel was causing steel-short manufacturing plants to revise their production schedules . Ford Motor Co .. which ha been running most of its 17 assembly plants on a four-day basis , will step up to five-day operations this week without fear of exhausting its stockpile . General Motors , which is altogether shut down made plans to start recalling workers within two weeks , hoped to be back in limited production in three weeks . <P> <P> " Explosive Issue . " The great fear of the automakers and other heavy industry is that they will have to shut down again almost as soon as they get back to full production . Though a few companies whose business is in slack period , may be able to build up small stockpiles during ; the 80-day Taft-Hartley injunction period , most companies will not be able to build up any appreciable supply . The pipelines are so clear that steel will be used as fast as it is delivered . If the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up immediately .
