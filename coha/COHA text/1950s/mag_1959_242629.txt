Composer Igor Stravinsky has a fierce distrust of most conductors , especially those who try to conduct his own works . But last week Stravinsky , 76 , sat in the balcony of Manhattan 's Town Hall and watched benignly while a slim , intense man mounted the podium and launched the first U.S. performance of Stravinsky 's most recent score-Threni : Lamentations of the Prophet Jeremiah . The conductor : Stravinsky 's protg Robert Craft , at 35 one of the world 's leading interpreters of avant-garde music . <P> First performed in Venice last fall ( TIME , Oct. 6 ) . Threni is a 33-minute work for chorus , orchestra and six solo voices , in which Stravinsky utilizes for the first time all twelve tones of the tone-row technique that he recently adopted . Unrelievedly austere in mood , the work unfolds in a series of canons for two , three and four voices , choral chants , spare snatches of instrumental sound . Merely to cue the onstage forces properly was a tricky task , and Conductor Craft performed it brilliantly . Stabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mouthing the Vulgate text in time with the singers , he shaped a performance of geometric clarity , suffused with a thoroughly moving air of penitential passion . <P> Secret Life . Craft 's affinity for modern music dates back almost as far as he can remember . Born in Kingston . N.Y. , into a nonmusical family ( his father is a real estate broker ) , he became a boy soprano in the Episcopal Church when he was six . By the time he was packed off to New York Military Academy at Cornwall , 13-year-old Robert Craft was an avid collector of modern scores , spent his spare time poring over copies of Stravinsky 's Sacre du Printemps and Les Noces , Schoenberg 's Pierrot Lunaire . Says Craft : " I led a kind of secret childhood life . " <P> He served as a trumpeter with Manhattan 's Radio City Music Hall orchestra while studying at Juilliard , later formed a professional music group called the Chamber Art Society . In 1947 Stravinsky offered to conduct one of his works for the group . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craft . " I still do n't know why he did it . " At Stravinsky 's invitation , Craft returned with him to Los Angeles as a music secretary , gradually became Stravinsky 's professional alter ego . <P> Admired Rival . Craft has become so familiar with Stravinsky 's musical thinking ( he meets with him twice a day ) that he has conducted the first performances of works such as Agon and In Memoriam Dylan Thomas . Some day he hopes to write a comprehensive book about Stravinsky , " this incredibly fresh man . " But , he adds , " It is not yet time ; he is not finished . "
