The Tokyo and Osaka stock markets , which had been climbing with heady abandon for more than a year , plummeted at news of a possible Korean truce . Speculative issues such as Nippon Heiwa Sangyo ( Japan Peace Industry ) , which had soared to 400 yen in early February , toppled to 82 . Even blue chips like Mitsuokoshi department store tumbled from 670 to 495 yen . Last week the market recovered slightly , but was still far down from its peak . <P> Long ago , a few farsighted Japanese warned that , but for U.S. spending on the Korean war , Japan 's economy would be in perilous shape . But it took the possibility of a peace settlement in Korea , and an end to U.S. spending , to drive home the change . <P> Tight Little Islands . Japan has been teetering on the edge of economic collapse ever since the occupation ended in April 1952 . The only thing that kept it from toppling over was U.S. dollars ( G.I.s alone spent more than $20 million a month ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain a population more than half as large as the U.S. 's on an area about the size of California , only 16% of which is tillable . <P> Exports are Japan 's lifeblood ; without them , she can not pay for the raw materials she uses , or for the food her people eat . Yet last year Japan 's imports exceeded her exports by $771 million . Only the $386 million pumped into Japan for military goods and $420 million in " invisible exports " ( i.e. , tourists , G.I. spending , new foreign investments ) made possible an apparently favorable balance of trade at year 's end of $35 million . <P> <P> Without wartime props , Japan would find it hard to feed and clothe her people . Even before the Korean war , Japan 's exports were being priced out of one market after another by cheaper , and often better-made German , British and Indian goods . Today , Japan 's industry is operating at only half capacity , and its real volume of exports is less than half the prewar level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports , are in the doldrums . The textile industry was one of the first to be revived after the war , and by 1951 , Japan was the world 's largest exporter of cotton goods . But the worldwide textile recession diminished Japan 's markets . There were import cuts by Australia , South Africa , Singapore and Britain . Many Asiatic countries , such as Pakistan , which once bought from Japan , have built up industries of their own . <P> Westward Ho ? The magic solution offered everywhere in Japan for these woes is resumption of trade with Communist China and Russia . Most Japanese industrialists , and many government officials , say quite frankly that they intend to do so as soon as they can in order to find new markets and sources of cheap raw materials . Actually , reopening trade with China would probably be a disillusioning experience for the Japanese . Before World War II , Japan was able to dictate terms to the Chinese ; now the positions are reversed .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
