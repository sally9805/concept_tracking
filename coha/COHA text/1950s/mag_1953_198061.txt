After nearly a year 's suspension and many stormy hearings , seven New York City schoolteachers were fired last week by unanimous ( 8 to o ) vote of the board of education . Two of them had denied that they were now members of the Communist Party , but refused to answer questions about their political past . The other five refused to answer any questions at all about present or past Red affiliations . Total New York City teachers dismissed since 1949 for similar tactics : 23 . Resigned without a hearing : 62.
