By last week any precampaign hopes that President Eisenhower could separate himself from Candidate Eisenhower dissolved in the crisp , electric , fall air . Under calculated and sustained personal attack from Adlai Stevenson ( see below ) , Ike last week used the forum of his press conference for jab after jab at his Democratic opponent . Then , within 24 hours , he delivered two roundhouse punches : the White House released two documents berating Stevenson for his stand on H-bomb testing and the draft ( see box ) . <P> Carefully , Eisenhower summed up for newsmen his ideas on a variety of election-year questions-including his reasons , as a reporter put it , for deciding " to begin attacking the Democrats . " The answer was simple . As always , his purpose was to state " the truth as I know it , the facts as I know them . " Some people , however , occasionally distort the truth . In such cases , although he did n't personally enjoy it , it becomes " necessary to clear away this underbrush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 minutes the President belted away . Would he care to comment on Stevenson 's claims that the G.O.P. is attempting to seize partisan credit for civil-rights progress-for example , in the armed forces ? Ike would and did . Frequently using the pronoun " I , " which he generally shuns , he spoke feelingly of his efforts to foster military desegregation during World War II . As far as he knew , Ike said , he was the first combat commander who ever incorporated Negroes into white units on the battlefield , and " they all got along together . " Thus , when the Administration came to power in 1953 , " it looked to us like it was time to take the bull by the horns , and eliminate it all , and that is what we have done . " Ike 's point , in line with his insistence on the facts and the truth : as a military commander he personally had put integration into effect even over the objection of some of his generals ( " General Patton , who at first was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea " ) ; then , as President , he had finished the job begun under the Truman Administration . <P> Why had he increased pace of his own campaign activity ? " I like to go out and see people . I get awfully tired of just listening to reports . " Had Vice President Nixon made any suggestions about places to go or subjects to cover ? No . All that Nixon had told Ike was : " Do n't let them work you to death . " As for his doctors , far from placing any limitation on his campaigning , they " always tell me I can do more than I want to . " <P> <P> The Future by the Tail . There were frank replies to other ticklish questions . The chances for a tax cut in the next year , the President said , are not " bright " or " right around the corner . " To a West German correspondent , who pointed out that the Bonn Cabinet was concerned about proposed reductions in U.S. troop strength , the President made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manpower are predicated on an increase in new machines and striking power .
