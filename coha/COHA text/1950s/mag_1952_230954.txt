Rarely has there been such a display of public feeling as the frenzied mourning of Evita Pern . <P> Last week , in near-freezing rain , some 700,000 Argentines made pilgrimage to her bier in Buenos Aires. * Most waited for more than 15 hours to get a 20-second peek at Eva 's thin and wasted face-and often at Juan Pern , who kept long vigils at her glass-topped casket . Sixteen persons were killed , crushed and trampled by the throngs ; 3,900 were in hospitals with injuries ; thousands of others got first aid . In the 20-block , four-abreast queue were infants in arms and a 102-year-old woman who cried , " I 've never known real pain before . " To feed the multitude , the army set up 24 field kitchens , gave away sandwiches , oranges , coffee . The street outside Evita 's resting place was packed with 8,340 funeral wreaths , costing $2,000,000 . <P> Away from the bier , there were other extravagant tributes : <P> The Union of Workers and Employees of the Food Industry cabled a request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Health Ramon Carrillo ordered a 220-lb. candle , the height of Evita ( 5 ft. 5 in. ) , to be installed in the ministry and lighted for an hour on the 26th day of every month ( the day Evita died ) . Carrillo thought the candle would last 100 years or more . Schoolkids got prizes for poems and essays praising Evita . They were also told that she " got sick because she kissed the ill , the lepers , the consumptives . " Carlos Alo , super-Peronista governor of Buenos Aires province , fired an employee who refused to wear a black tie . A Buenos Aires youth was arrested for laughing on a streetcar . " Attitudes like this are antisocial , " said Alo . Eva 's political cronies in high office , who stand to retain power if they can keep her memory alive , formed an " Association of Friends of Eva Pern " and asked , " What would Christ have been without his disciples ? " ( Eva 's disciples , presumably , will be wanting to look after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aid Foundation , a " charity " which is Argentina 's biggest business and keeps no accounting of funds . ) <P> So clamorous was the public lamentation that Evita 's funeral was postponed indefinitely . Instead , the government planned to move her body this weekend to Congress , there to lie briefly in state . Then her closed casket will go to the headquarters of the great labor federation she controlled , to stay until a downtown monument tomb can be completed . <P> <P> * A celebrated U.S. outpouring of grief over a popular idol 's death , the mourning in Manhattan over Rudolph Valentino in 1926 , attracted a mere 50,000.
