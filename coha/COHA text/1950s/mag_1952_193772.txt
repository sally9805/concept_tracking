The Democratic Party stands in Chicago as a slightly aging Robin Hood with a paunch and a double chin , still bold and confident , but worried about the changing facts of life in Sherwood Forest . <P> For 20 years the Democrats have carried the nation with slogans of soaking the rich and championing the underdog . In 1952 , they hope to do it again . But things have changed : now the villagers as well as the rich get soaked by taxes , and Maid Marian 's mink coats have caused comment in the greenwood . There is a feeling that Robin has not been smart about the Communists , and Little John Acheson 's foreign policy has caused fear for the future . Above all , Herbert Hoover is not Sheriff of Nottingham this year . <P> Basic Democratic strategy is to carry the " sure " Democratic states ( i.e. , those states that have not gone Republican in the last four presidential elections , which include the South plus Arizona , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Rhode Island and Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and add to them New York ( 45 ) and California ( 32 ) . That would make a total of 267 in the electoral college , or one more than necessary to elect a President . <P> Block in the Old Road . By nominating Ike Eisenhower , the Republicans have upset this calculation . Eisenhower has strength in the South as well as in New York-California ( and other populous industrial states ) . <P> If the Democrats choose to hold the South at all costs by soft-pedaling FEPC and other New Deal measures hated in the South , they run a very grave risk of losing New York and California . On the other hand , if they try to make sure of New York-California by a hard-hitting New Deal program , they stand to lose a big piece of the South . <P> One extreme way of dealing with the situation is for the Democrats to stick 100% with the New Deal and take their risk in the South . This , in effect , is advocated by Candidate Averell Harriman and by labor leaders like Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme way of dealing with the situation is to hold the South at all costs . This is exemplified by Candidate Richard Russell , who in all likelihood could hold all Southern states against Eisenhower . But Russell is almost certain to wreak havoc in the doubtful Northern and Western states . <P> The extreme solution of the Harriman and Russell candidacies seemed to be making no progress with the delegates . <P> Rather than plumping for either extreme course many of the delegates favored a candidate who would have more chance with both the South and New York-California . On the convention 's first day , the two names most often heard as meeting this description were those of Illinois ' Governor Adlai Stevenson and Vice President Alben Barkley . <P> Truman , who had cooled somewhat on Stevenson , let it be known that he thought Barkley would be a good candidate . The Barkley boom began to gather surprising momentum-until it was knocked on the head by organized labor . The labor leaders who exercise a veto ( " Clear everything with Sidney " ) on major Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They simply decided that his age ( 74 ) made him a difficult candidate to sell to union members .
