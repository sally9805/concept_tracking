The Greek press hailed him as " the Olympic champion of glory , " " the most brilliant symbol of the Greek race 's eternal adamantine virtue , " " the beating heart of <P> Hellenism . " Tall , swart-bearded Archbishop Makarios himself likened his return to Athens in Easter week after a 13-month exile to " Christ 's return to Jerusalem . " A surging throng , which included the Greek Foreign Minister , senior military officers , and politicians of every hue , was on hand at Athens airport .

Women shrieked and wailed , struggled to kiss his hands and black robe . <P> In a white Cadillac convertible Makarios slowly made his way into the heart of Athens . People hung out of windows and balconies , perched on rooftops and jammed the sidewalks . Some threw flowers and shouted with joy ; others wept . Everywhere there were scrawled signs : " Enosis " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Neither can Middle East oil or the so-called defense of the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not want trusteeship nor to be ruled by others ; we want self-determination , and we will fight for it .

" Responsibility for all Makarios ' words and actions rests fully upon the shoulders of the Greek government , " declared Turkish Premier Adnan Menderes last week . " Greece may crown him , she may worship him . But to us Makarios is a'notorious terrorist and will remain so . " *
