The Red Skelton Show ( Wed . 8 p.m. , CBS-TV ) is a summer replacement revue ( for Arthur Godfrey ) that indicates that some of Comedian Skelton 's best writers may be on vacation too . While Skelton 's characterizations of the tramp , Freddie the Freeloader , and the goon , Clem Kiddlehopper , were pretty much up to par on the first program , some of his straight monologue material was merely second-rate . Skelton 's first guest was the sugar-coated Pianist Liberace , who 1 ) mooned interminably through Debussy 's Clair de Lune and grinned ecstatically through a Latin rhythm piece , 2 ) cavorted with Skelton in a dance number , and 3 ) played straight man when Skelton came to call as a treblesome piano tuner . Item : Liberace , in his famed toothpasty smile , showed portraits of his four greatest inspirations - " Bach , Beethoven , Paderewski . . . and my dentist . " <P> The Blue Angel ( Tues. , 10:30 p.m. , CBS-TV ) stars a quiet , wry , young ( 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a joke . On a set simulating Manhattan 's Blue Angel nightclub , Bean casually introduces a few expert acts ( including , on one program , Comic Leo De Lyon , who can whistle and hum two songs at once ) and spends the rest of the all-too-brief half an hour in bland comedy . Example : the prizes for a contest run by the National Kumquat Growers ' Association - $5,000 worth of sneakers ( size 17E ) , six miles of dental floss , an all-expense , two-week vacation trip to Youngstown , Ohio , one brand-new screen door ( together with 200 flies ) . <P> Conversation ( Sun . 7:30 p.m. , NBC Radio ) is half an hour 's worth of stimulating and sometimes brilliant talk by Book Critic-M . C. Clifton Fadiman and two or three guests , whose only guide is a topical springboard , e.g. , " American Women , " " Middle Age , " " Basic Fears . " The show started off as a local TV program last spring . NBC and Producer Louis Cowan pulled it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it a splashless launching all over again on radio . From week to week such sophisticated raconteurs as Bennett Cerf , Marc Connelly , Abe Burrows , Steve Allen and Sam Levenson join Fadiman for the kind of lively gab that has not been heard on radio since the old days of Information Please . Item : Punster Cerf 's line about Ireland 's Poet George ( " A E " ) Russell and an angry moment when " A E 's Irish rose . " The next step , in the normal course of events , is back to television . Meantime , NBC , in the belief that talk is cheap , is footing the radio bill - a mere $500 a week .
