The U.S. Government last week turned full face to enter the age of the satellite . It left behind the notions that no speedup was necessary in missile and satellite development , that the administrative organization of the defense establishment was satisfactory , that interservice rivalries were somehow healthy , that the budget remained sacrosanct even while Red moons spun through the sky . Just a few weeks before , President Eisenhower , asked at his press conference if he might name a special White House scientific adviser , replied : " I had n't thought of that . " Last week he not only appointed such an adviser but gave him far-reaching powers . Indeed , the turnabout irrevocably set the U.S. on a new course in nearly all defense fields . <P> SCIENCE &; TECHNOLOGY : In a national radio and television speech ( see below ) , President Eisenhower named Massachusetts Institute of Technology President James Rhyne Killian Jr . as his Special Assistant for Science and Technology . Killian 's assignment : to marshal U.S. science against the advance of Soviet technology . Killian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will act as the President 's trusted eyes and ears , will join the small group of advisers-such as Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and Presidential Assistant Sherman Adams-who have immediate access to the President . Acting on Killian 's advice , Ike intends to take over as his own missile czar ( a term he intensely dislikes ) . <P> INTERSERVICE RIVALRY : The President ordered that William M. Holaday , special Defense assistant for missiles , be given full authority to crack down on what Ike called " alleged interservice rivalries " that might hinder missile development . No more than Killian will Holaday be a missile czar . Rather , he will be a Pentagon straw boss for missiles , working for the President through Killian and Defense Secretary Neil McElroy . <P> SATELLITES : The day after the President 's speech the Administration provoked more interservice rivalry by blowing an opening whistle on an Army-Navy satellite game . To the surprise of both Army and Navy , Defense Secretary McElroy shifted dramatically from the Administration position that the Navy 's Vanguard Project is coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. needs , ordered that Vanguard be " supplemented " by the Army , which has long insisted it could put a satellite into outer space with its Jupiter-C test rocket ( in September 1956 a Jupiter-C was fired to an altitude of 600 miles and a distance of 3,500 miles ) . <P> NEW PROGRAMS : Whenever practicable in the future , said the President , new military development projects will be taken out of the hands of the individual services and put under a single manager . One possible fruitful field for such a change : anti-missile missilery , still in its infancy , but already the subject of an Army-Air Force custody fight .
