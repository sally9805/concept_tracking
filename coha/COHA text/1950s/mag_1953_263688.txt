At Baltimore on Sept. 25 , 1952 , Candidate Dwight Eisenhower gave his views on the nation 's most pressing problem-defense policy . This was also the problem that five-star General Eisenhower knew most about . He listed " three personal convictions that I hold to be true . First , our defense program has suffered from lack of farsighted direction . Second , real unification of our armed forces is yet to be achieved . Third , our defense program need not and must not push us steadily toward economic collapse . " <P> Last week the three convictions became a specific plan-the first rational defense policy the U.S. has had . The new plan is built around air-atomic power , and it faces up to the strategic prospect actually confronting the U.S. , i.e. , that the enemy has a choice of forcing either all-out atomic war or limited war upon this nation . The plan will cost less because it follows a principle laid down in Baltimore : " We can not pretend to do everything in every field all the time . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower inherited the Truman defense budget . Like previous Truman budgets , it was not shaped by the White House , or by the Secretary of Defense , or even by the Joint Chiefs of Staff acting as a unit . It was a combination of the requirements and goals of individual services-Army , Navy , Air Force-each trying to get as much money as it could . Nobody judged these claims in the light of an overall , supra-service plan based on the total military , political and economic interest of the U.S. Insofar as there was any standard for resolving conflicts and putting the budget together , the Joint Chiefs used what they called " the balanced-forces concept . " This was a high-sounding name for the convenient but irrational practice of splitting the money in three roughly equal parts . <P> The Eisenhower Administration did not have time for a basic revision of the Truman defense budget . It made a few billion in cuts , mostly in the Air Force . These did not conform to any new general **27;10773;TOOLONG plan . Rather they were a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of these cuts , for instance , were based on the assertion of Secretary Wilson that there was no use budgeting for planes that would not be produced in the budget period . <P> But housekeeping cuts were not what Eisenhower had in mind in the Baltimore speech . While they were being made , he ordered the Joint Chiefs to get busy on a basically new kind of budget . Last October they produced a " New Look , " but it turned out to be the old kind of budget with some novel trimmings . Eisenhower and the National Security Council did not accept the phony New Look , sent it back to the services for further work . <P> Eisenhower 's instruments of pressure on the services were Defense Secretary Charles E. Wilson and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Arthur Radford . Last week , with Wilson taking part in the discussions . Admiral Radford and the three service chiefs finished sketching out a defense program for 1956-58 . Defense Department officials handed the sketch to the President , along with a draft of the 1955 defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret , but the main changes were made public.They are :
