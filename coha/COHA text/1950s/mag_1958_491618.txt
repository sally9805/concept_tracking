I t was a day none of us on the staff of the San Francisco Zuu will ever forget , although the Mousands of s.isitors never realized what was happening . They owe their blissful ignorance to a garden rake , for oddly enough this was the weapon that tipped the scales away from tragedy and a general panic that day . Arthur ( Doctor ) Watson , our bird caretaker , was strolling along a path behind a row of animal cages , near the zoo 's boundary fence , when he came face to face with a huge tiger . Doc froze , and they stood there looking at each other , a few I 'M apart . " I did n't really believe it , at first , " Due said , " but there he was ! " Doc was unarmed and realized that nothing could save him if anything happened to excite or anger the beast .

Carefully Doc " The tiger 's out ! " and the siren screams . The boss of San Francisco 's zoo tells what happens when wild beasts get loose among crowds of human beings . circled on past the animal , then broke into a frantic run for the zoo service building a hundred yards ahead . He burst into the zoo kitchen , where several keepers were at work , yelling , " The big tiger 's out ! The big tiger 's out ! " While the men grabbed rifles from the gun locker , the late Walter Hackrneyer , who was our head keeper . stepped out to the corner of the building to take a look . There stood the tiger , staring at Hack calmly . Hack decided it would n't be smart to make a lunge for the emergency-alarm button a dozen feet behind him . So he reached very casually for a hose beside him . Splashing water in front of the tiger , Hack shooed him back , praying meanwhile that no zoo visitors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the alarm button  --  one blast of the siren , to indicate the emergency was in Area Nu .

All the keepers on the grounds came running , ( Continued on Page .14 ) // bunging tirearins , a 5101.11 rope and a heavy net VIA : Ca11.1 rehearse , because we neser know 18 hat to expect , but one our with a high-powered rifle always takes an assigned station in the service yard , near a telephone , ready to lire on any escapmg beast as a last resort . ; turd to call III Odd I- emergency equipment or an ambulance if necessary . Another keeper goes the main gate 01 the Zoo with a rine , teasing the gates open for public exit , but leady to elose them if an animal appears . Even before Hack 's alarm brought reinforcements , there were a half-dozen keepers outside the zoo kitchen . Some had rifles , others nothing but lengths of scrap lumber they picked up in the service yard . The tiger , alarmed , wheeled to start back down the path Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the service building , and crouched ominously . With a frantic scrabbling of hoofs , all but one of the donkeys Jumped back away from the fence . Incredibly , one male stood his ground ready to light if the tiger got through the knee . The huge tiger charged headlong into the heavy wire netting of the fence . The netting bulged , but held , and the animal tell back , shaking his head . Then he padded on down the path , away loan the keepers . Doc Watson yelled , " If he cots through that boundary gate at the far end , he 'll be in the children 's playground ! " Still unarmed . Doe sprinted along the boundary fence to try to head the tiger off . The tiger was n't in sight when Doc reached the playground gate and made sure it was locked , but he soon reappeared on the path behind the cages . Doc clambered up on lop thee row of . age buildings with a garden rake , waving it in front of the tiger . The animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But instead , seeming to tire oI the game , he retreated peaceably into his own cage . Iseepers came forward cautiously and locked the door . 1 did n't bud out until later that three zoo visitors , a father and his two little boys , had been close enough to touch that tiger  --  without ever realizing their danger . The tiger had walked around in front of some of the cages in the row while Doc was running to head him off The big animal strolled between the cages and the guardrail which keeps the public a safe distance out from the bars , he father and his boys crowded right up against the rail . " Such a nice eat ! " the father exclaimed happily as the tiger padded along past them inside the railing . " Pat ihe cat , " Ile suggested  --  actually reaching across to give the tiger a friendly thump on the rump . Fortunately , the tiger chose to ignore 11 . The San Francisco Zoological Gardens is the third zoo t have headed in my lifetime of work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us knows what to expect when the emergency siren screams . The biggest problem Is the public . Like our tiger , most animals will return to their cages if no one disturbs or angers them . However , when human error leases cage doors unlocked and the animals venture out , people ca n't seem to stay away . Most of the visitors who happen upon itch scenes are like the father and his as  --  they do n't even realize the danger . So it 's up to the keepers to catch the animals , and catch them right away , before they catch up with some well-meaning but misguided human visitor . That 's the principal reason we have our high-powered rifles  --  to kill the i11111111:11 if necessary in order to protect the public . As far as the keepers themselves are concerned , they naturally feel safer when armed , but we ithnost always manage it recapture before a crowd cart gather . I remember , for instance , the lime we welt : startled to see a mother lion and two cobs come walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoo hospital and someone had left a door : oar . Guided by their noses , the lioness and her babies were heading for the kitchen to see what they could do about speeding up mealtime . There was no chase at all this time . The lioness seemed to know what was expected of her as soon as she saw the keepers . She led her cubs obediently back to their hospital cage . To experienced animal men , lions usually are less frightening than tigers . Tigers can be friendly one instant and deadly the next , You never know when they 'll turn on you . Lions arc more predictable , I 've found . If they 're friendly and you behave carefully , they 'll usually stay friendly . Still , it 's only common sense to be armed . Animals and people make a chancy mixture . The emergency siren may herald a comic-opera chase , or it may mean death . We never know . Years 420. before I came to San Francisco , a bull elephant in the zoo here went berserk .1 rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senseless rage upon a keeper , smashing him to the floor with one ponderous foot and literally ripping the body to pieces with his huge tusks in front of the horrified crowd . Even on alarms when we 're quite sure we know better , we take no chances . Like the time a woman ran into the service yard screaming , " The hippopotamus is eating a mail " All animal men know that the hippo is strictly a vegetarian , but we grabbed firearms and ran for the pool , I 'm sure we were all wondering just what we would do if he really were eating somebody , but we had to gel there fast and do our best . Our first glimpse of the pool was n't too reassuring . A keeper was ! caning over the pool 's edge , soaking wet . Had he tried to rescue someone ? Then he saw us and grinned sheepishly , and we all relaxed . There was no one in the pool but the hippo . The keeper had been dropping titbits into the animal 's cavernous mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell practically into the hippo 's jaws , That was when the woman ran screaming for help . The hippo , as dismayed as the keeper , promptly dived to get away from the man . Like all gqod animal men , the keeper insisted it was all his own fault : " The hippo did n't do anything : I just slipped . " I 've never fallen into a pool or a cage , but I once did have to tight for my lifc to keep from being dragged into the quarters of a pair of furious apes . It was the only time I 've ever had to call for help . The late William Randolph Hearst kept a private ( Continued on Page .16 ) massage away . It added that hairdressing " is more akin to architecture than to the care of the skin . " 46 t Como our &; from Nee 44 ) zoo , one of the biggest In the country , on his slim San Simeon ranch . and I was caring for the chimpanzees then : at the time .

They also have hysterical temp.:nand attack vs ith terrifying fury IA hen : 111110cd . An angry chimp is the one animal I would n't esen attempt to recapture . We have one particularly mean-tempered fellow in our San Francisco Zoo now , 4111t1 it he ever gets alit we 'll shoot to kill , on sight . The riot at the Hearst ranch had an outdoor pen with an indoor sleeping wont . reached through a hallway wait sonically sliding door which could he raised by a rope hanging down from the hallway ceiling . One night after the chimps had settled down in then bedwom , I realited I had forgotten to got : them %safer . I entered the hall , locking its outside door carefully behind me , then raised the sliding door to the chimps ' quarters Just enough to slide a pan of water under it . It was n't , I discoscred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out suddenly and a powerful black hand grabbed my ankle . Still not particularly alarmed . I stamped hard on the hand with my other foot . But instead of letting go . the chimp grabbed my free ankle with his other hand and gave a mighty jerk . I toppled backward and , like a drowning man clutching a straw , yanked at the door rope as I fell . Up went the door , and before I realized what had happened both chimps were out on top of me . Thc female raced down the hallway and leaped up on a doorknob . I never could understand how that ape could balance herself on that knob , but she did . And during the whole ruckus she sat there , screaming and slapping herself on her knees , encouraging her male like a high-school cheerleader . Fortunately for tie , the male never changed his grip from my ankles . I le bit viciously through my heavy leather boot and through a toenail , meanwhile swinging me around like a sack of potatoes and trying to drag me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally both of us were out in the hall . way , clear of the doorway . I let go the rope and the door slammed down , locking both apes  --  and me  --  cozily into the little hallway . Only then did it occur to me that this was n't going to help much . I got one hand on the outside door , and while the ape clung to my ankles I tried to get the right key into the lock . If I could get outdoors , I thought , he 'd leave me  --  but have you ever tried to select the right key from a full key ring under such circumstances ? I began to yell at the top of my voice , hoping to get a keeper to break down the door . The elephant man did hear me and came running , but by that time I 'd finally managed to find the key and unlock the door . The ape and I rolled out in a swirling tangle of arms and legs , right at the surprised keeper 's feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoors the ape let go in order to look over the strange situation  --  whereupon I grabbed a limber lying nearby . Startled , he ran back into his quarters and I slammed the outside door . We had to cut a hole through the roof , however , to open the sliding door so the pair could get back from the hallway into their cage . By then , I could hear the elephant keeper muttering to himself , taste makes waste , haste makes waste . " I asked what he was worrying about , now that it was all over , and he said , " I left in such a hurry I forgot to shut the door of the elephant house . The elephant is gone . " He meandered off to begin his own search while I was doctoring my injured toe . Luckily , thc elephant was feeding peaceably on a hillside near the zoo buildings and returned obediently enough to captivity . When an elephant does go on a rampage , there is n't much any keeper can do short of shooting the beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in all my years of working with them , I have killed only one . It was a sick , maddened buffalo on the big Hearst ranch . I was riding a horse on a narrow mountain trail when the buffalo appeared ahead of us . I slipped off my horse and opened tire as the animal charged . It took three shots , and the brute fell so close to us that blood spattered my boots . There were comic-opera sequences at the Hearst ranch , too , just as there arc in every other zoo in the world , I remember the day a grizzly bear got out and was wandering around a little hill . A Mexican laborer , head down , was hoeing diligently around some fruit trees , and since bears are very shortsighted , the grizzly was very close to the man before either saw the other . Mexican and bear were equally startled and fled in opposite directions  --  around the hill , so , of course , they met again on the opposite side . Yelling frantically , the Mexican climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roping him and returning him to his pen . The Mexican insisted for hours afterward that there were two bears . He 'd seen one on each side of that January 25 1938 One small bear named Pokey was a regular Houdini at getting out of boxes , pens and cages in our San Francisco Zoo . A Young Himalayan bear from India , he had twice escaped on shipboard en route to San Francisco . Our alarm siren , until Pokey arrived , had been choked with rust , but Pokey changed that . He had n't been with us a week before I noticed he had almost chewed his way out of his wooden enclosure . " Let 's move him to a regular bear cage , " 1 told Hackmeyer , the head keeper . " Boss , you do n't know Pokey , " Hackmeyer said . " I 'm betting he 'll slip out of there . " " It 's impossible , Hack , " I said , and Pokey was moved forthwith . Next morning Hackmeyer reported to me , bright and early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , boss , Pokey is gone ! " Our secret search for Pokey lasted three weeks . We discovered later that he had spent a good part of that time nesting in a tree right beside my house ? Finally , I spotted a single footprint near the beach on the unfenced Fort Funston military reservation south of the zoo . 1 called in an experienced keeper , the late Bill Behre , to help me close in on Pokey . " Now , Bill , " I said , " when you find him , do n't shout . Whistle . It 's more distinct and easier to hear . " Bill started to explain something , but I waved him off and away we went . We were nearly a half mile apart when I heard Bill yelling at the top of his voice . I paid little attention at first , figuring that if he had found the bear he would surely whistle . Poor Bill ! He had never got a chance to tell me that he did n't know how to whistle . But soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I began to run . As I approached , Pokey bolted from a clump of brush beside Bill and scampered into a nearby swamp . Bill did n't see him go , and waved at the underbrush , yelling , " He 's in there ! He 's in there ! ! was just walking along , whacking each clump of brush , and he jumped up right in my face . " These bears make a horrible noise when alarmed . They lunge up on their hind legs , spring up into the air and let out a hideous " I-was-here-first " roar . That is what had happened to Bill , inches from his nose . I trotted all the way back to the zoo to sound the siren for extra men to comb the swamp , but it simply was n't our day . First , the siren did n't work . It was evidently choked with rust . " You hold the button down while I climb up on the roof and get it unstuck , " I told a keeper . " Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nevertheless , the sudden noise must have startled him , for when the siren sounded he did instinctively jerk his finger from the button . Then , realizing that was a mistake , he pushed it again . The result was two blasts instead of one  --  a code signal for the lion-house area instead of the service yard , where I wanted the men to gather . I rounded up several men and started in an old car for the service yard . Up in the service yard , Hackmeyer , hearing the two blasts , gathered several men and started in another car for the lion house . Of course , we met head on , on a blind curve of the service road . No one was hurt , but both cars were disabled . What followed trust have resembled one of those unbelievable old-lime Keystone Cops movies . Both groups of men jumped from their cars and ran madly past each other toward their original destinations . This was no time to stop and listen to explanations ; in an emergency , a keeper must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , was that Pokey was long gone by the time we got that swamp buttoned up with our full cordon of searchers . But we landed him , finally , by baiting a large box trap with delicacies and leaving it near the swamp area overnight . Next day we put him in a bear grotto . " I absolutely guarantee this one , " I told the men . Hackmeyer was back the following morning with that familiar gleam in his eye . " Sorry , boss ! Pokey is gone again ! " This time it did n't take long to find him . He had lawn a rude nest in a tree a dozen feet from the ground and had made one mistake . He allowed one foot to dangle , so that we could hardly help seeing it . " This will be easy , " I told the men . Climbing up after Pokey I threw a rope loop over his foot . Then it dawned on me that I had no way of keeping him off me . With a horrifying roar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both tumbled to the ground . The rope flicked free , and Pokey and I were off and running . The men say I was several rods ahead of the bear , but this is untrue . I was really running after him , for fear we might lose sight of him again . But this time Pokey scooted over to the bear grottoes . Somehow he clambered down the absolutely vertical concrete wall into the grizzlies ' grotto . A huge grizzly sprang on him immediately , growling and snapping and ripping . From the spectators ' rail in front of the grotto , I started firing with my six-gun , striking the concrete floor a little behind the grizzly 's tender hind feet . The bullets would ricochet and give him a stinging , searing bite on the loot . Each time , he wheeled to face a new enemy , but found no one behind him . But by the time m ! . revolver was empts he ss.is getting wise and refusing to be shoracted . Pokey was . rat real danger of getting killed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y through the rump muscle . and he roared siolently and fled into his den . The sore and frightened Pokey climbed spryly up the sertical wall and Os er into his own grotto , fly this time . I noticed that three of the keepers were forcibly restraining a burly visitor who was struggling to reach me , shouting indignands . " That guy is shooting the bears ! " We moved Pokey to a closely barred cage in the lion house after that and , strange to say , he has seemed quite contents-4J there ever since . Human error being inevitable , you never know what is going to escape or when . Perhaps no creature has ever caused more of a stir among the visitors than a myna bird that once escaped from the San Francisco Zoo . Mynas can talk with almost human distinctness , and this one had learned to imitate the keepers ' announcement to visitors that it was closing - hour . One day a keeper failed to close a door and the bird escaped . While the keeper went for some nets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby picnic ground . Here a grandmother was busy cleanng away the remains of a lunch while the younger members of the family had gone to the playground , and a few blackbirds gathered , looking for crumbs . The myna , looking for all the world like one of the blackbirds , flew down to the table , peered up into the elderly woman 's face and said , - fuse o'clock , folks . Time to close the zoo . " - " What did you say ? " the woman asked ; then , realizing that she was talking to a bird . hurried hysterically to the playground to report to her family that she must be losing her mind . It 's a good thing our keeper arrised just then , for the more she explained , the more strangely her family looked at her . I think one of the most ridiculous animal escapes in which I was ever involved was that of a tiger in the Portland , Oregon , zoo  --  although I must confess it did n't seem funny to me at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do  --  somebody left a door open . Most of the 50,000.000 Americans who visit zoos every year know that such ani mats Rase what is , in effect , a Iwo-room cage , but few people know exactly how these work . Each , or pen , has its separate outside door , so that a keeper Can get in . There is also it door between the two units Much normally remains open . but which can be closed to lock the : 111a111.11 in one cage while the keeper cleans the other . This time , the keeper had cleaned the tiger 's outside pen , but had failed to lock its gate behind him when he left , Then he went around into the building and re . leased the tiger from the inside cage , so he could clean that . The tiger bounded into the cello pen , saw its open gate and sentures ! out , ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

He was strolling around on the lawn when I saw him . I knew instantly that here was deadly danger , especially if visitors got in the way , but I 'll have to admit that my first thought was . What a beautiful sight  --  Mar huge tiger on the viral green of the /awn ! I dashed into the office and got a rifle , then walked very casually over toward the tiger , talking to him quietly . He answered with the strange , friendly , purring noise that tigers make when they ; ire in it good mood . I talked quietly for a moment , then suggested we return to his building . As though he understood esery word , he walked hack toward his pen with mc . I thought afterward how silly it must have looked , I was walking along with a rifle over my arm , and the tiger was following quietly at my heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and trotted off with me as easily as a cat might carry a mouse . But we walked with mutual understanding until we came to the entrance to the building . Beside the doorway was a leopard , circling uneasily in his outdoor cage . The tiger hated the leopard and lunged at the cage . The leopard snarled back mu him , and I knew I 'd never get the tiger past that cage and into the building as long as the leopard was there . I 'd have to drive the leopard hack into his indoor cage , out of sight . I finally laid down my rifle and picked up an iron rod to poke at the leopard . There was n't much room in front of the leopard 's cage , and the tiger and I were actually shoving each other aside as I tried to poke the leopard away from the bars . The tiger did n't seem to mind . evidently believing I Was helping him torment his enemy . Eventually I got the leopard back out of sight . and the tiger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get him inside and close the doors it would be better than having him running around in the open . It was before normal visitors ' hours in the building , and I knew there 'd be no spectators to contend with . Even so , it almost became one of those fryingpan-into-the-fire moves . As we came in and I closed the doors behind us , two keepers were emerging from a tall bird cage they had been cleaning at the far end of the building , nearly 100 feet from us . The smaller of the two men , coming out of the cage first , was the first to sight the tiger . Without a word , he whirled and attempted to jump back into the bird cage  --  colliding violently with his big partner , who had n't yet noticed the tiger . The big man , angered , shoved in return , and they had quite a little tussle . Then the big fellow spotted the tiger , and both men did something I never could understand . Instead of going into the bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside of the wire netting , The cage stood three feet above the floor and was ten feet tall , topped with a coping , or parapet , of smooth plaster that added another four feet of height . The two men scooted up that ten feet of small-mesh wire , on up over the smooth , four-foot vertical coping , and jumped down on top of the cage , I 'd have sworn it was impossible , but I saw them do it . Their scramble seemed to excite the tiger dangerously for an instant , but he was quickly distracted . He discovered the leopard in the inside cage only a few feet away , and my troubles really began . I knew ' I had to drive the leopard back to his outside pen , or the tiger would never quirt down and go back to his own cage . But now the tiger was excited and frustrated . He growled at me several times and sneered as only a tiger can snoer , as much us to say , " You double-crossed mc ; you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would lower his head and crouch slightly . Each lime , all I could do was raise my rifle and lake careful aim , wailing for him to charge or to become quiet again . And every time l raised the rifle , the two keepers peeping from atop the tall bird cage would shout helpfully , " Do n't shoot him ! Do n't shoot him ! " I knew something had to be done , and called to a keeper outside the building to gel a piece of meat , Unfortunately , instead of tossing the meat into the tiger 's cage from outside , the man walked in the front door , right past the tiger . The huge animal sprang after him instantly , while I yelled , " Drop the meat ! Drop the meat ! " Instead . the panic-stricken keeper ran . I 've never seen a man run so fast in my life , but the speed of a charging tiger is unimaginable . He was flying . Shooting was out of the question ; there was too great a risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the last instant the man dropped the meat . The tiger seemed to swerve in his final lunge , taking the meat instead of the man . The huge animal skidded along to a stop with his teeth and claws firmly pinning the meat to the floor . As soon as he discovered that the prey he had captured was not alive , he picked it up in his mouth and looked around for a secluded spot in which to cat . Naturally he chose the one he knew best  --  his own cage . He ran over , sprang inside and sat down contentedly with the meat . A little shakily , we closed the cage door . As I stepped outside the building , I met a man and a woman who had watched in awe from a distance as the tiger and I were jostling each other outside the leopard 's cage and as we walked on inside . " What in the world was going on ? " the woman asked , " Just moving a tiger , " I said . We keepers never alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed . " Is that the way you move a tiger ? " I knew the whole thing had looked pretty ridiculous , but it had been a terrifying strain , and suddenly . I simply could n't be polite any longer . " How would you do it ? " I demanded , and went away to rest my nerves .
