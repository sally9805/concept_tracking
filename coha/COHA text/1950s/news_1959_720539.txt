txt Governor Furcolo 's batting average in the legislative league continues at an abnormally low level as far as Massachusetts Covernoes en . Whereas his immediate predecessor , the present Secretary of State Christian A. Herter , had a phenomenally high average in getting his program through the Legislature , Governor Furcolo has been confronted with a continued lack of legislative cooperation . Although the House and Senate now are Democrat controlled , his average has not gone up much for several reasons , including an apparent failure to understand the legislative mentality , the nature of his major proposals , and a breakdown in liaison operations between the Governor 's office End the Legislature . His chief failures and successes , paradoxically , have been in the field of state finance . Withholding Victory The Governor 's biggest victory of the 1959 session thus Jar has been passage of the NV ithholding system , whereby the Governor achieved balance of the current fiscal year 's budget as a result of windfall revenue from the system . His biggest failure to date has been his inability to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually the bill has not yet been brought to a vote in the House or Senate . but . to date its prospects have been poor , although the Governor is pulling out all the stops to achieve victory before the Legislature adjourns . Probably his second biggest . victory was the administration 's success in turning back the House " economy bloc " drive to slash 20 to 30 million dollars from his record-high budget . After the House Committee on Ways and Means had trimmed out about 10 million dollars from his 454-million-dollar budget and the House apparently was on the way to even heavier cuts , the administration recouped sufficiently to hold the additional cuts to about $1,300 , - 000 . Battle Still fends But even this battle is not over , because the Senate may make further cuts , Every cut and every increase in revenue from existing tax sources reduces the prospects for the sales tax . ' ' he Governor 's other successes thus far have been few . The Legislature did adopt . a lay , - broadening the application of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . color , or creed . But on this issue it appeared the Governor rode in on the coattails of a sure thing . with bipartisan support well established even before the Governor made his recommendation . In addition . the Governor won passage of deficiency appropriations totaling $12.498.685 for the fiscal year ending on June 30 , 1959 . Tax Extensions ' Won Also the Governor won a Iwo-year extension of 3103,000,00o in temporary taxes . This was hard-1y a major feat , however , because these taxes have been extended periodically in the past and failure to continue them would have required passage of other taxes . However , he has failed to gain passage of a simplified tax-rate system for the state income tax , as he had recommended . Already rejected by the Legislature is a pet Furcolo bill to set up a federal-state coordinator to seek additional federal funds for the state . Sidetracked to a study commission is another favorite Fur-coin proposal to make the terms of the State Budget Commissioner , the State Comptroller . and the State Director of Personnel and Standardization co-terminus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill to transfer from the Governor to the Mayor of Boston power to appoint the Boston Police Commissioner and the Boston Licensing Board members . Of course , much of the Governor 's program is caught in the log jam piled up behind the budget . Many of his proposals arc still in the House or Senate Committee on Ways and Means , Gains Anticipated Once the budget is cleared . action will be taken on them tin the floor of the House and Senate . with the outcome uncertain . For instance , he favors a statewide referendum on abolition of capital punishment . His proposal now rests on the Senate table pending House action on legislation to abolish capital punishment outright . Many advocates of abolition have been critical of the Governor 's stand for a referendum . Governor Furcolo 's proposals for liberalization of unemployment . compensation and workmen 's compensation benefits are definitely tied in With labor 's bids for such increases . The outcome awaits Senate efforts to compromise opposing labor and management demands . It is anticipated that some advances Will be made in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average may improve .
