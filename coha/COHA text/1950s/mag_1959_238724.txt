When Labor Secretary James P. Mitchell promised last April to eat his hat on the steps of the Labor Department if unemployment did not drop below 3,000,000 in October , he thought he was making a sure bet . But last week the Labor Department announced that although employment was higher than in any previous October-66,831 000-unemployment stood at 3,272,000 . Just before the figures wene officially announced , Mitchell appeared on the Department of Labor steps to keep his part of the bargain-or almost . Said Mitchell : " I am off by several hundred thousand entirely due to the steel strike . If there had been no steel strike , unemployment would be off 600,000 from what it is . Now I am going to eat my hat . " <P> Mitchell lifted the lid off a black hatbox , revealed a yellow cake shaped like a fedora , with a dark chocolate hatband and the initials J.P.M. in white . Said he : " The first piece I 'm going to cut I will send to R. Conrad Cooper , who is the management negotiator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this performance . The second piece I will send to David McDonald , the president of the Steelworkers , who shares responsibility . The third I will eat myself . " And he did .
