 | THE GREATEST MYSTERY DRAMA OF OUR TIME By Andre Visswt BEHIND the forbidding red-brick walls of the Kremlin the greatest mystery drama of our time is now being enacted . It is a drama of enormous consequence to the entire world , yet it is so shrouded in secrecy that even the best-informed experts in the West can only guess at what is really happening . Their guesses , however , based on painstaking analysis of all available evidence , point to some startling conclusions . Stalin 's succession no longer seems to be the simple matter it looked to be at first . Indeed , the Red dictator 's death itself appears to be wrapped in mystery . Was it a natural death or was it murder ? And an even-deeper mystery surrounds the present position of Sta- lin 's chosen heir , the inscrutable Georgi Malenkov . If the experts read the signs rightly , something has gone radically wrong in the Kremlin 's well oiled machinery . Malenkov is seemingly Stalin 's official successor , the No . I man in the Soviet hierarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in the shadows behind him ? the figure of a man as ruthless as he is ambitious . Mark this man well , for it is he whose every action today is the subject of the most intense speculation . He is no stranger to the Moscow scene . You have seen him in countless newspaper photographs : the bald head , the strong mouth with tight , compressed lips , the pale-blue eyes behind prim pince-nez ? eyes that are shrewd and knowing but somehow aloof . It might be the face , some say , of a distinguished surgeon or scientist . It happens to be the face  | of Lavrenti P. Beria , boss of the dreaded Soviet Secret Police . What is it about this man that has so attracted the world 's attention ? dust this : for 15 years Lavrenti feria has been the skillful , ruthless watchdog of Soviet security . During those years he acquired tremendous power , second only to that of Stalin . His network of spies spread across the Soviet empire . His MVD agents , above the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kremlin 's slightest suspicion . If that sinister power were firmly at the disposal of the new chief of state , the safety of the regime would be assured . If , however , this power is not at y'lalenkov 's disposal , if Beria should be reserving it for his own purposes , there may ensue a violent struggle for supremacy which could precipitate a serious internal crisis in Russia . This struggle could drastically weaken the Soviet empire , perhaps even hasten its end . Or it could unleash forces that not only would bring ruin to the 754 million people behind the Iron Curtain but might threaten our own lives as well . That is why the world 's best experts are trying day and night to evaluate the fragments of information sifting through the Iron Curtain . What excites them is that even now , as the pieces of the Soviet puzzle fall into place , they spell out a story of fantastic intrigue and violence , of plot and counterplot , which rivals the gaudiest thriller . And at the center of this web of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes always upon the squat , tough figure of Lavrenti Beria . Let us take a close look at certain events of dramatic significance which both preceded and followed Stalin 's death . Let us see what clues they may yield to help unravel the Kremlin mystery . THE DRAMA begins on January 13 , 1953 . A sensational announcement comes over Radio Moscow : nine topflight Soviet doctors mostly Jews ? who have long been the physicians of the highest Kremlin officials , including Stalin himself , arc accused of murder . It is charged that in 1948 they killed , by " medical sabotage , " Andrei Zhdanov , one of the leading members of the Politburo and in line for Stalin 's succession ; that in 1945 they assassinated another prominent member of the Politburo ; that at the time of the arrest they were plotting to undermine the health of ranking Soviet generals . The doctors arc said to have made full confessions . The free world is agog . The air becomes thick with varying explanations of this " outburst of Soviet anti-Semitism . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Semitism , they feel , may be a smoke screen . The " doctors ' conspiracy " sounds more like the rumblings of a new struggle for power . It is an ominous reminder of the bloody purges of the ' 3o 's , which had started at a similar low level and ended with the execution of many of the most prominent Bolsheviks . Soviet purges always start low and  | move upward , from level to higher level . But how high will this new purge reach ? Who will be its final target ? The wording of the accusation provides a clue . It says : " The agencies of State Security did not discover the doctors ' conspiratorial organization in time . " This theme is taken up by the Soviet press , which accuses the State Security agencies of " criminal laxity . " To a Russian such charges are grave . For he knows that when a high Soviet official falls ill he does not simply go to a doctor or to a hospital and receive treatment ; MVL ) agents are present at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctors had plotted to do away with Zhdanov and the others , therefore , they could hardly have done so without the knowledge and support of the Secret Police . Carry this reasoning further . The " doctors ' conspiracy " was aimed at the very top level of the Kremlin . Such plots do not originate with underlings . Someone with the highest authority must have been involved . The one man with such authority is the man in charge of the over-all security of the Soviet Union , the quiet , soft-spoken master of terror  --  Lavrenti Beria . But this is incredible ! Since 1938 Beria had stood like a rock which no Kremlin storm could shake , no wave of Soviet intrigue threaten . Other members of the Politburo might scheme and vie for Stalin 's power ; Beria 's job was to protect that power . This he had done with outstanding skill and devotion . Two of his predecessors as head of the Secret Police Yagoda and Yezhov had been liquidated ; one was shot , the other put away in an asylum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Few had ever enjoyed Stalin 's confidence for so long . But the year 1952 does seem to have been a difficult one for Beria . There are unmistakable signs of a struggle between Malenkov , representing the power of the Communist Party ( as one of its ten secretaries ) , and the master of the equally powerful Secret Police . In this struggle Beria does not seem to have fared happily . There is less frequent mention of him in the Soviet press . There is no news of progress in the development of atomic energy , for which he is responsible . A purge in Georgia wipes out many close associates in his  | homeland . And , most revealing , the Ministry of State Security is infilI rated with men who can report over leria 's head directly to Stalin . It is these men who " discover " the " doctors ' conspiracy . " Now the Soviet puzzle is beginlong to take shape . Here , clearly , is a he beginning of a campaign to liquilate Stalin 's most powerful lieutenant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs that no such campaign could have been launched without the approval of Stalin himself . Why did Stalin turn on the man who had served him so faithfully for so long ? There are a number of explanations , all conjectural . Some reason that Stalin , having settled on Malenkov as his successor , realized t hat no orderly transfer of authority could take place so long as Beria retained his vast power . For power in Moscow belongs only to those who can command it . Therefore , Stalin was determined to eliminate in advance any threat to the man he had chosen to be the next chief of state . Another theory pictures the old dictator , on the doorstep of death , obsessed by a persecution mania . Crazed with suspicion , seeing conspirators in every dark corner of the Kremlin , Stalin may have lashed out at any who were capable of challenging him , just as he did in the purges of the ' 3o 's , when he abandoned himself to a hysterical orgy of bloodletting . And the first of his victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police . In any event , the evidence indicates that by January of this year Beria 's days were numbered . Nothing short of a miracle could save him . THEN SUDDENLY , without warning , that miracle occurs . Less than two months after the disclosure of the " doctors ' conspiracy " Stalin suffers a stroke . Three days later , March 5 , the dictator lies dead . Beria is saved . Now , in the rapidly reconstructed Soviet hierarchy , Beria emerges more powerful than ever . Malenkov , as expected , takes Stalin 's place as Soviet Premier . But after him Beria is top man in the new policy-making inner cabinet . Beria gets a similar top position in the 14-man Presidium of the Central Committee of the Party ? the new name for the Politburo . And , most important , the three ministries dealing with Soviet security ? Internal Affairs , State Security and State Control ? arc firmly in his hands . And now come the most intriguing clues of all , clues which bear on the nature of the " miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beria . Some time after Stalin 's funeral a foreign diplomat in Moscow ended a report to his government with this laconic sentence : " The story of Stalin 's death has not yet been written . " Other observers were inclined to agree . Western intelligence officers , scrutinizing the Soviet press , had noted some strange events that took place in the Kremlin shortly before Stalin  | died . On February 17 , two weeks before the dictator 's death , this cryptic notice appeared on the back page of Izvestia : " The Office of the Commandant of the Kremlin regrets to announce the premature death on February 15 of Major Gen. Piotr Yevdokimovich Kosynkin and expresses its condolences to the bereaved family . " Kosynkin was a chief of Stalin 's bodyguards . From other sources it was learned that at about the same time two men from Stalin 's personal secretariat mysteriously disappeared without trace . And soon afterward an even more revealing disappearance was discovered : the chief of Stalin 's secretariat , Alexander N. Poskrebyshev , the dictator 's closest collaborator for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the circumstances surrounding Stalin 's death . No foreigner in Moscow had seen the dictator alive in the latter part of February . Earlier in February he had received the ambassadors from India and Argentina , who found him in seemingly good health . But after February 17 he did not attend a single public function , and there was no news of his activities in the Soviet press . The communiques issued when Stalin was stricken abound in medical details . But , strangely , not a word is said about what he was doing or whom he was seeing on the clay he is said to have suffered the stroke . After his death the new men in the Kremlin spent little time glorifying the ruler who had lived almost as a demigod . The funeral speeches wens businesslike rather than moving . The period of mourning was surprisingly brief . After Stalin 's loth birthday Pravda published congratulatory telegrams for a full year ; after his death the newspaper treatment was all but over in three weeks . We may never know the true version of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers now believe that what the evidence so strongly suggests is entirely likely : that Beria , through means long familiar to his grim agents , was able to redeem his career in the one way left open to him . For this much we do know : Before Stalin 's death Beria was a man condemned ; his reprieve came only when the heart stopped beating in the body of the man he professed to revere . And , on the strength of his experience alone , no man in Russia was more capable of bringing to a halt the beating of that heart . MEANWHILE , the third act of this incredible drama follows swiftly . Ten days after Stalin 's death Georgi Malenkov is out of his position as Secretary General of the Party , the supreme political job in the Communist world . The Presidium the old Politburo ? is reduced in membership from 25 CO 14 , eliminating all but five of iy-lalcnkov 's supporters . These dramatic maneuvers arc clearly the work of a bold and astute politician working silently behind the scenes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensational announcent , unique in Soviet history . On April , i Beria 's Ministry of Iniernal Affairs states publicly that all accusations against those arrested in the " doctors ' conspiracy " were false ; he confessions are said to ? - . vc been extracted by " impermissible means " and the doctors are released . The ) eputy Minister of State Security , Ryumin , alleged to have been in charge of the case , is arrested as a " criminal adventurer . " The former minister , Semyon Ignatiev , is accused of " political blindness and gullibility " and dismissed . Many other officials who were placed in the State Security department by Stalin arc dismissed or arrested . Here is an unbelievably audacious assertion of power . To discredit the " confessions " of the doctors is virtually to admit that the whole structure of Soviet justice , with its parroted confessions extracted from thousands of tortured victims , has been a cynical mockery . Satellite countries which had obediently followed Moscow 's anti-Semitic line are left gasping in bewilderment . Their victims , summarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever the consequences , Beria has made unmistakably clear what is now in store for anyone who dares to conspire against him . And indeed Beria 's enemies may well pause when they reflect on the formidable power now exercised by this quiet little man with the scholarly pince-nez . For Beria is master of the following domains : He controls the Secret Police machine , comprising at least ? one million men , half of them organized as elite military formations with artillery , tanks and air force ; supervises the political administration of the entire civil population of the Soviet Union , including the Party machine ; oversees the whole military apparatus of the Soviet Union , including political organizations , counterespionage and intelligence services ; supervises defense industries , the transportation system and atomic-energy research ; exercises control over the Soviet foreignservice representatives and agents abroad , the Cominform , the foreign Communist parties and their Red Front organizations ; directs the censorship of mail , radio and all publications ; and is boss of millions of slave laborers throughout the nation . In sum , Lavrenti Beria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . This is power enough to stagger the imagination . But is it enough to satisfy the ambitions of this ruthless and supremely ambitious figure ? And what are his relations with the equally ruthless and ambitious Soviet Premier , Georgi Malenkov ? That is the crucial question . It may be that Lavrenti Beria already holds supreme power and is content to let Malenkov serve for the time being as front man . There are good reasons why he might choose this course . For one thing , Beria is the only Soviet leader whose whole political career has been in the  | Secret Police , the most hated and feared of all Russian institutions . It would be tactless for the Chief of Police to seize power openly ? yet . Also , Beria , like Stalin , is a Georgian , a foreigner in the eyes of the great bulk of Russians . It might be prudent if another Georgian did not appear as the top figure in the Kremlin yet . Beria possesses an Oriental patience ; he may gladly bide his time while watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already he has indicated the line he will follow to overcome his political handicaps . In 1938 , when he took over the Secret Police from Yezhov , a fanatic whose search for victims had shaken the very foundations of the Soviet system , Beria purged a handful of the most overzealous purgers and gave amnesty to a few thousand whose exile had been most outrageous . Now in 1953 he has resorted to the same tactics ; by freeing the innocent victims of the " doctors ' conspiracy " and pun ishing the officials who arrested them he is able to display himself once more as the " defender of the innocent and the purger of the purgers . " At Stalin 's funeral Beria was the only speaker who promised to guard the " constitutional rights " of the Soviet citizens . To those who have followed the extraordinary career of Lavrenti Beria , one thing seems certain : He must almost surely be looking to the day when he will possess openly the supreme power in the Soviet Union . The stage is set , therefore , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its repercussions will be felt throughout the world .
