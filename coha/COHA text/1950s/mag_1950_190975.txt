Dashing across Austria with his tanks in the spring of 1945 , ex-Cavalryman George S. Patton paused long enough to watch a prancing white stallion being put through some remarkable parade-ground paces . General Patton had heard the story of Vienna 's famed Spanish Riding School and its Lipizzan* horses . Their classical routines went back to the 16th Century , their bloodlines to Spain and Arabia . When Patton learned that the Nazis had appropriated the Lipizzans and sent 200 mares and foals to a town in Czechoslovakia , he acted with characteristic dash . He sent a tank column to bring them back to Austria . " America , " said Horseman Patton , " must save some part of the old European culture . " <P> By last week , 110,000 U.S. horse fans had had a look at the culture that had so impressed George Patton , and most of them were impressed too . Under Col. Alois Podhajsky and his riders of the Vienna school , the Lipizzans were the No . I spectacle of Manhattan 's National Horse Show . <P> Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erect Colonel Podhajsky , eight smartly dressed riders doffed their two-cornered hats in a courtly bow to the crowd . Then eight white stallions paraded in stately fashion through an intricate precision quadrille . The spotlight event was an exhibition of cadenced , old-school courbettes , croupades and caprioles , all of them stylizations of the leaping , twisting , fighting and frolicking of high-spirited horses in pasture . <P> Among the most spectacular was the fighting pose of the courbette . Without apparent urging from its rider , the performing Lipizzan reared high on its hind legs , executed a series of forward jumps while pawing furiously , almost like a boxer , with its forelegs . Such a maneuver , Colonel Podhajsky explains , was naturally in high favor among medieval cavalrymen when ever they found themselves hemmed in by foot soldiers . <P> U.S. fanciers who had missed the Lipizzans in Manhattan might not have another chance for a while . To his disappointment , the colonel had not been able to interest U.S. impresarios in taking the horses on tour . Next week , after performing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Austria . <P> <P> * All time record : 388 by Jockey Walter Miller in 1906.
