The Germans got back into top-rung international competition , for the first time since World War II , in the two-man world bobsled championships . But not without a preliminary hassle . <P> L'Alpe-d'Huez , scene of the championships , has a fine bobsled course ; it also has vivid memories of 1944 , when German occupation troops tricked French resistance groups into the open and mowed them down . It took a French Foreign Office check of the records-and the discovery that none of the German bobsledders ever served near L'Alpe-d'Huez-to reconcile French opinion . Even then , the German team decided not to fly the German flag from their hotel , not to wear insignia . <P> The Germans made up for this anonymity on the course . In four runs down the steep route ( which drops 500 feet in less than a mile ) , they not only won the 1951 world title , but set a new course record : 1:15.9 . Runners-up : the Americans and the Swiss . <P> " Wait until they hear about this in Munich ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too bad the German flag is n't here , " said Driver Andreas Ostler.
