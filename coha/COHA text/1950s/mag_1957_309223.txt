The TV industry looked ahead with mutterings and misgivings last week to one of the fall season 's new castings : John Crosby in the dual role of TV critic for the New York Herald Tribune ( plus 92 other papers ) and a well-paid CBS performer , presiding over the network 's ambitious , hour-long Sunday afternoon show , The Seven Lively Arts . <P> How can a critic write evenhanded reviews when he works for one of the major networks ? " I struggled with my conscience for 48 hours before giving my decision , " says Crosby . " I am going to continue my column just as before , and CBS is fully aware that they will still get scathing criticism from me . In fact , I am afraid I will lean over backward and belt the hell out of CBS-that is the real problem . " He expects no gripes from other networks . CBS TV Program Director Hubbell Robinson thinks that Crosby " is a man of sufficient integrity to handle both jobs very well . " The Herald Tribune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was no reason to , " he says ) , is also unperturbed . " It goes without saying , " says Executive Editor George Cornish , " that he wo n't review his own show . " <P> But the other networks , and even some executives at CBS itself , were not reacting as Crosby hoped . Said one official : " A terrible mistake . This is the kind of thing that makes criticism suspect . Any time he pans a show on NBC or ABC , somebody is sure to say : ' What do you expect , he 's on the CBS payroll . ' And bending over backward is n't a proper posture for a critic either . " <P> There were a few other troublesome implications . How will Crosby 's paper get critical coverage of Omnibus and Wide Wide World , which NBC will alternate weekly at a time overlapping Performer Crosby 's appearances for CBS ? " That had n't occurred to me , " says Crosby . " I 'd hate to miss Omnibus , but maybe I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our time on CBS . " How will Crosby 's readers get critical coverage of Seven Lively Arts , one of the new season 's major shows ? Well , Crosby thinks he may get somebody like the Herald Tribune 's Drama Critic Walter Kerr to review it for him . One added complication : Critic Kerr works on the side for the competing Omnibus as dramatic consultant and sometime performer .
