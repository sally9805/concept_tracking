OPS Boss Mike Di Salle reluctantly cleared the way for a new batch of price rises last week . Acting under the Capehart Amendment to the Defense Production Act , he issued an order permitting some 100,000 businessmen to ask for price boosts if their costs have risen . Among the items affected : clothing , tobacco , wines and liquors , gasoline , drugs and cosmetics , coal , meat and other foods . Automakers , who have already boosted prices about 9% since Korea , got special orders of their own ; they may now increase prices as much as 5% . For a man who had once denounced the Capehart Amendment as impossible to administer , Mike Di Salle was administering as if he loved the job . Last week 's orders were the last of seven granting price rises to most business concerns under the amendment .
