txt President Eisenhower said today that if there was any shooting around Berlin , it would be the Communists who started it . He was commenting upon Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev 's warning yesterday that the use of force against the East German authorities would mean war . " We are not saying that we are going to shoot our way into Berlin , " the President said at his news conference . Question 8 , Page 14 . Later the President landed in Texas , en route to Acapulco , Mexico , for a meeting with President Adolfo Lopez Mateos . He told the news conference that the Western allies were going to continue carrying out their responsibilities to the people of West Berlin . If an attempt is made to prevent that action , he said , " it will be somebody else using force . " ? Defines Possible Incident Asked about the Soviet leader 's stern warning against shooting , the President replied : ' He must be talking about shooting to stop us from doing our duty . After all , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Soviet Union has threatened to turn over its occupation authority in Berlin to the East Germans by May 27 unless there is agreement by then with the West to make West Berlin a " free city . " Britain , France and the United States hold that their rights in West Berlin were guaranteed in agreements with the Soviet Union at the end of World War II , and that Moscow can not cancel those agreements unilaterally . East German Act Feared There is concern that the East Germans , if they controlled access to West Berlin , would try to control or cut off supplies flowing to the city . " We say we are just going to go and continue carrying out our responsibilities to those people and the ones that we agreed to undertake way back in 1945 , " President Eisenhower said today . But the President repeated that the Allies were willing to negotiate the entire problem of Germany and to consider in those negotiations any reasonable proposal . Question 4 . He also said that the West had no intention of building up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a menace . The President said the Allies sought a just peace in which East and West would solve specific problems on " some reasonable basis . " " And until that conies about , " he said , " I think we have to do the best we can , stay strong , but always holding out a hand ready to be grasped if it will be grasped in good faith . " The President said preparations here for a conference with the Soviet Union were going ahead despite the grave illness of Secretary of State Dulles . He said he and Mr. Dulles met yesterday at Walter Reed Hospital and " we just decided that we were going right ahead . " Question 153 Mr. Dulles ' work is being handled by " able men of his own choosing in his department , " the President said . He denied that there were plans to hold a foreign ministers ' conference in Washington or New York where Mr. Dulles might more easily take part . Questicn 15 . The President also denied he had given any thought to picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical period of negotiating that lies ahead . The President had little to say about the visit later . this ' week to Moscow of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan . He said the British leader sought to present his own Government 's views of " the problems that beset all Europe . " Mr. Eisenhower suggested these views would regect the Western position , not merely Britain 's . Question 14 . The President said he had not discussed the planned Moscow tour with Mr. Macmillan . Secretary Dulles did on his recent visit to London . The next order of business on the German issue will be the Soviet response to the Western bid two days ago for a foreign ministers conference . Diplomatic sources here expect that answer to contain a sharp attack on the Western powers for their failure to produce any constructive proposals . But the same sources , some from Communist nations , expect that , Moscow probably will agree to a ministers meeting . It is assumed , however , that the Russians will ask to have other Communist states represented . Meanwhile , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting may not be arranged before the May 27 deadline . The question is what policy the Western powers will follow if the Soviet Union goes through with its program and the East Germans cause trouble .
