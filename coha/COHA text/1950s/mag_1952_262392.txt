Claude Debussy did not like the way Felix Weingartner conducted Beethoven 's Pastoral Symphony- " with the care of a conscientious gardener . He tidied it so neatly as to produce the illusion of a meticulously finished landscape in which the gently undulating hills are made of plush at ten francs the yard , and the foliage is crimped with curling tongs . " Weingartner survived this crushing criticism , was one of the most celebrated conductors of his day ( 1863-1942 ) . In Vienna , Berlin and in the U.S. , which he visited twice , he was noted for his performances of the Beethoven and Brahms symphonies . <P> In the ' 20s and the ' 30s , Columbia recorded Weingartner 's performances of all 13 symphonies . Bestsellers in their day , they have long been out of stock . Now , " by request , " Columbia has repressed them on LP . Few listeners will side with Debussy . Weingartner proves to be a tidy conductor indeed , but from these recordings , some made with the Vienna Philharmonic , some with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mellow and spacious splendor . <P> Other new records : <P> Mahler : Songs of a Wayfarer ( Blanche Thebom , mezzo-soprano , with orchestra conducted by Sir Adrian Boult ; Victor , I side LP ) . Mahler 's hauntingly lovely song cycle here gets a pure and richly expressive performance . Recording : excellent . <P> Mozart : Quintet in A , K. 581 ( Benny Goodman , clarinet ; the American Art Quartet ; Columbia , 2 sides LP ) . Mozart was fascinated with the " soft , sweet breath " of the clarinet , still a novelty in his day . He wrote three chamber works for it , of which this is the best . Benny Goodman plays cleanly and with style . Recording : excellent . <P> Puccini : La Bohme ( Licia Albanese , soprano ; Jan Peerce , tenor ; the NBC Symphony Orchestra , Arturo Toscanini conducting ; Victor , 4 sides LP ) . This recording of the Maestro 's 1946 broadcast will make opera fans regretfully aware of how seldom they hear a first-rate performance of Bohme . Toscanini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a rare force , clarity and subtlety . The singers are all in fine voice-including amateur Baritone Toscanini , whose hoarse old bawling can be clearly heard accompanying the principals in several passages . Recording : excellent . A new recording of Tosco , ( Cetra-Soria , 4 sides LP ) is not so happy . Soprano Adriana Guerrini is shrill as Tosca , Tenor Gianni Poggi and Baritone Paolo Silveri only passable as Cavaradossi and Scarpia . Recording : good . <P> Verdi : Otello ( excerpts ) ( Ramon Vinay , tenor ; Eleanor Steber , soprano ; Frank Guarrera , baritone ; Metropolitan Opera Orchestra , Fausto Cleva conducting ; Columbia , 2 sides LP ) . This anthology includes the best duets and arias of Verdi 's best opera . Vinay defends his title as the finest Moor of the day , and Steber makes a pure-voiced Desdemona ; Guarrera is not malignant enough to do Iago full justice . Recording : excellent .
