Of every 100 women who become pregnant , the statistics show , some 85 will give birth to live babies after about nine months , and five will bear premature babies , of which four will live . But in the remaining one-tenth of all pregnancies , the women will lose their children by involuntary abortion before they are mature enough to survive independently . Why ? And what can be done about it ? In Spontaneous and Habitual Abortion , * published this week ( Blakiston ; $11 ) . Dr. Carl Theodore Javert. a busy , unorthodox <P> Manhattan obstetrician , gives this life-and-death subject the full treatment for 450 illustration-packed pages , comes to some unconventional conclusions . <P> As Dr. Javert , 50 , tells it , he was " an ignorant neophyte " in 1936 when he blithely prescribed a high-mineral , high-vitamin diet for a three-time aborter of 41 , gave her full emotional reassurance , and was rewarded by delivering her normal baby-although older and supposedly wiser men were using more complex treatments . Since then it has not always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and a large following of husbands and wives who are convinced that they would never have had children if they had not met him ) . <P> Mismarriage , Miscarriage . First problem is to try to decide why a woman aborts . Says many a layman after taking <P> Biology I : " Nature is discarding a defective fetus . " But Dr. Javert and colleagues at New York Hospital made microscopic examinations of 2,000 aborted fetuses , found no abnormality in 22% . In nearly all these cases he suspected some fault in the mother 's physical or psychic setup ( cases attributed to defective sperm were exceedingly rare ) . One astonishing statistic , suggesting factors introduced by marriage : while 10% of married women abort , only 1% of unmarried women do so . Also surprisingly uncommon ( seven cases in 2,000 ) was injury as a cause of abortion . " Nearly all pregnant women sustain some type of external trauma and do not abort , " says Dr. Javert . <P> After personally supervising more than 200 pregnancies for women who had had three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly personal method of treatment . He still relies heavily on vitamins A. C and K. also on hesperidin ( sold as a source of the controversial vitamin P ) to discourage the premature bleeding which often signals ( and may cause ) abortions . He was one of the first to use tranquilizers . Impressed with the fact that many patients do not gain weight early in their pregnancies , but may actually lose , he encourages them to eat all they want then , watches later to make sure that the gain does not become excessive . <P> Insecurity Is Catching . Because Dr. Javert believes so strongly that the marital situation is often to blame , he calls in both husband and wife for detailed interviews . He finds that a wife who feels insecure about her husband 's love or overshadowed by his having had a previously successful marriage with children , is likely to have an insecure fetus . Often such couples rate high on the Kinsey scale of sexual activity : Dr. Javert holds that orgasm predisposes to uterine contractions and premature labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co be learned about the workings of sex hormones , he is dead set against using stilbestrol , a synthetic drug on which many obstetricians rely heavily .
