For Wes Santee , the Kansas cyclone , this was the one to win . Only a week before , in the Wanamaker Mile , he had lost a last-lap wrestling match to Private Freddie Dwyer and while the two were tangling , Denmark 's Gunnar Nielsen ran off with Santee 's world indoor mile record ( TIME , Feb. 14 ) . Thoroughly chastened and uncommonly quiet , Wesley went home to Lawrence , Kans. to train . When the starter 's gun cracked for the Baxter Mile last week at the New York Athletic Club games , Wes wanted to be ready to unwind with the race of his life . <P> Too Fast for Rabbits . No doubt about it , Wes was anxious . After one blistering lap , he even got impatient with Northeastern 's Dick Ollen , the mechanical rabbit who had served as such a fine pacesetter the last two times they ran . Wes took over the lead and hustled through the first quarter in a man-killing 56.6 seconds . If he had his way , no one was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow ; neither Gunnar Nielsen nor anyone else was going to have enough kick left to catch him in the stretch . <P> For a while , it seemed as if Santee 's early speed might pay off . Nielsen was rattled at the sight of his rival pulling away , shifted into high and ran his heart out closing the gap . Only Dwyer , striding smoothly some 30 yards back , was wise enough to run his own race . His discipline made Santee look like a schoolboy . <P> No Room for Roughhouse . A dogged competitor who would probably run right up the back of a man in his way , Dwyer refused to be tricked into that early scrap . He held himself in , listened like an old-timer to that split-second stopwatch ticking in his head . Up forward , Santee finished the first half in 1:59 . It was too fast . Both he and Nielsen were running down . With four laps to go , Freddie Dwyer knew it was time to move . Taking no chances of repeating the past week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprint . <P> Santee was finished ; Nielsen was fading fast . While the two leaders had run themselves rubber-legged , Dwyer had timed himself perfectly . He crossed the line in 4:06.2 , a new Baxter record . Some 65 yards back was Nielsen , the world 's fastest indoor miler . And three yards behind him staggered Wes Santee. the Kansas cyclone that had blown itself out . <P> Unwilling to let the milers run off with the track meet , the other contestants set their share of records : <P> In the 1,000-yd. run , Norway 's Audun Boysen set a meet record : 2:10.2 . <P> In the two-mile college relay , Syracuse University 's runners paced off a meet record : 7:38.5 . <P> In both his trial heat and the final of the 60-yd. dash , Lieut . Rod Richard of the Armed Forces track team tied the N.Y.A.C. meet record : 0:06.2.
