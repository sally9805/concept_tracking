From Red China 's Premier Chou En-lai last week came a sweeping order formalizing the obvious : all Christian missions , schools and hospitals supported by Americans are taken under strict Communist control . Other provisions : Missions that can not support themselves may call on Peking for subsidies ( or shut up shop ) . Missionaries who " oppose the People 's Government " will be dismissed , and those charged with " crimes " will be punished . Missionaries who are " not reactionary " may stay on , but only in subordinate positions . <P> Best guess as to the order 's purpose : to " legalize " the seizures that have been going on for months , and to clear the way for a more vigorous drive against those U.S. missionaries ( mostly Roman Catholic ) who are trying to stay .
