Each night , wherever he went , former Minister of the Interior Franois Mitterand was pelted with aged pears , tomatoes , oranges and occasional root vegetables selected for their hardness . Ex-Premier Mends-France , breezing out of one rally to address another , narrowly dodged a left hook and threw one off-target in reply . The leader of the Union for Defense of Shopkeepers and Artisans , a motley , rowdy party standing against all candidates and most taxes , swore his followers to accept summary punishment up to and including death if found guilty of violating the party line . Another ex-Premier , Edgar Faure , filed suit because a newspaper printed a statement accusing him of indiscriminately passing out the Legion of Honor to buy votes . <P> All France ( plus half a dozen exotic remnants of the old empire ) simmered last week with such hot-tempered politics . Only a few days remained before 26 million Frenchmen were to go to the polls and with their ballots reveal what the politicians called " tomorrow 's secret " : Who , or rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,000 candidates , backed by the clanking machinery of 18 parties , competed for 596 seats in the National Assembly . * The cascade of campaign rallies grew to at least 3,000 a day . Public interest was so high that registration was 1,200,000 above past records . <P> Old and familiar faces crossed the scene . Crowds heard again from Edouard Daladier , France 's agent at Munich , and Paul Reynaud , Premier when France fell . Aged ( 83 ) but intrepid Edouard Herriot got from meeting to meeting in his wheelchair . Bodyguards propped ailing Communist Chief Maurice Thorez before microphones to breathe a few words on behalf of Red candidates . <P> On the right flank rode Edgar Faure , the slick-as-onionskin politician who precipitated the snap elections , and Antoine Pinay , the slow and steady little tanner from St.Chamond . They led a relatively smooth-working alliance of independents , farmers , other conservatives and Catholic M.R.P.s . <P> On the left flank , a knight in half-polished breastplates and only part-plumed helmet that he had not expected to use until spring , rode Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong but not strong enough , the pundits guessed , to carry Mends to power . The Communists , though reduced in numbers and caught in contradictions of policy , rode the guerrilla trails in confident expectation of gaining 20 or 30 seats . Also present were roughhousing bully squads organized by brash young Anti-Taxer Pierre Poujade to tear down candidates and break up opposition meetings , Fascist-style.
