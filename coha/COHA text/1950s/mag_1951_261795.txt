On New Year 's Eve , laughing crowds in London 's Piccadilly Circus , restored to its prewar dazzle only 18 months ago , gave a full-throated rendition of Auld Lang Syne . The New Year did not stay welcome for long . Last week , with housewives grousing over the latest cut in the meat ration ( eight ounces to four ounces weekly ) , Piccadilly 's neon lights were doused by a coal shortage . <P> The government ordered advertising signs throughout the country switched off , begged the public to save gas &; electricity , suspended 3,854 passenger trains . Philip Noel-Baker , Minister of Fuel &; Power , pleaded in a radio address : " Put the kettle on before , not after , you light the gas . Do n't boil more water than you need . Keep the lid on the saucepan while you 're cooking . Try to use your electric heater for half an hour less every day . . . " <P> Grim Memories . Long-suffering Britons hastened to obey . The warning revived grim memories of the freezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport , threw 4,000,000 out of - work , sent overcoated millions to a long diet of cold food . <P> Britain 's 1950 coal output set a postwar record of 216,301,100 tons &shy; but it still fell 1,700,000 tons short of the nation 's needs because of the soaring demand for power for the booming export drive and rearmament . British miners , dissatisfied with pay and conditions in the nationalized coal industry , were not giving their best . Thousands of them , tired of the dirty , dangerous work , quit to join the expanding armed forces or to take better-paying jobs in other industries . In 1950 , the mining force fell from 708,900 to 688,600 ; absenteeism and labor disputes climbed . <P> Bargaining Agent . To strike at the heart of the problem , Prime Minister Clement Attlee on Jan. 3 invited the 27-man executive committee of the National Union of Mineworkers to a conference at 10 Downing Street . Because four or five members of the executive are Communists , including N.U.M. General Secretary Arthur Horner , Attlee did not appeal for more coal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , Attlee 's Colonial Secretary , ex-Miner Jim Griffiths , gave the executive a comradely pep talk , said the government would n't let the miners down . At meeting 's end , Attlee promised to redress the miners ' grievances in return for their pledge that they would try to dig 3,000,000 extra tons of coal by April . <P> Last week , with the promised pay . increases , an extra week 's vacation ( to start in 1952 ) and a new pension scheme under their belts , Britain 's miners set out to redeem their pledge . To give them added zeal , every miner in the country got a letter starting " Dear Friend , " printed in a reproduction of the Prime Minister 's handwriting . The letter said : " The nation looks to you ; I am sure you will not fail . . . " It was signed " C. R. Attlee . "
