txt The month-end figures on changes in Britain 's gold and dollar holdings in September are not encouraging . Holdings ? . of such reserves plunged another . $282 million last month . This loss , the biggest for any month since January , 1952 , carried the country 's reserve stocks of . monetary gold and dollars to $1,850 million , or $150 million under the figure that by popular rule-ofthumb estimates is widely regarded as the minimum figure compatible with safety . Nevertheless , it should not be concluded that in drawing down its gold-dollar reserves Britain is fighting a losing battle for the defense of the pound . The loss of reserves sustained to date is not comparable to losses which had been suffered through a continuing deficit of payment or trade accounts . they are losses that reflect the legitimate risk incurred by a bank which knows its position is sound and that it can place its hands on the necessary assets to meet a prolonged " run " by depositors . ' Is Britain 's position one that justified such confidence and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence now available the answer to this question must be " yes . " Britain 's greatest asset , perhaps , is its determination to protect the pound , come what may . And in situations such as the present one , this is half the battle . But Britain also has other formidable , and more tangible , assets working for her . In the first place , she is running a surplus in her , shall we say , " legitimate " accounts with the rest of the world . 1. n the second place , her reserves , actual and potential , are still very large . Besides the stock of gold and dollars of $1,850 million she has in hand , she has an additional $1,200 million in potential reserves as a result of her arrangement with the International Monetary Fund and the United States Export-Import Bank . This makes a grand total of $3,050 million . But that is only half the story . What about the resources of those who have been speculating agailist the pound in the expectaticat that they will make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to devaluate the pound ? In an address on the sterling situation made in July , E. M. Bernstein , director of research for the Monetary Fund , estimated the holdings of sterling by foreigners at roughly $1,800 million . Since then the figures have fallen to perhaps $1,300 million . Not all of this , moreover , is available for speculation ; much of it repre-1 sents working balances that can not be drawn down much farther . If this is the case , then it is no longer the pound that is being squeezed , but the bears who have sold pounds in the expectation of buying them back later at a lower price . Once this fact is realized , not only would it mean a halt in the flight from sterling but it could mean a tremendous flight back to sterling , and a restoration of Britain 's reserves at a level close to their all-time high .
