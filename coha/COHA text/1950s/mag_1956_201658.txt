The first question before the Security Council was : What is Egypt 's mood on the Suez question , hard or malleable ? Foreign Minister Mahmoud Fawzi , whose ability as a diplomat is best described by the fact that he has held top jobs under both King Farouk and President Nasser , leaned over the horseshoe table and started to talk . First , bald Mahmoud Fawzi recited in his soft voice Egypt 's familiar grievances against the French and British . Then he purred : " Foremost in importance is a system of cooperation between the Egyptian authority operating the Suez canal and the users of the canal . " When the foreign ministers around the table heard that word " cooperation , " they had their answer . <P> <P> In response to this obvious invitation , the U.S. 's John Foster Dulles made the next conciliatory move . " The essence , " he said , " if ... we are to seek justice , is that the operation of this international utility shall be insulated from the politics of any nation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviously time to head off Security Council action on an Anglo-French proposal to condemn Egypt for its canal seizure and explore what Fawzi meant by " cooperation . " Fawzi agreed to meet privately with Britain 's Selwyn Lloyd and France 's Christian Pineau in U.N . Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold 's 38th-floor U.N . offices overlooking the East River . " I will be acting merely as a chaperon , " Hammarskjold told Dulles . Said Presbyterian Elder Dulles , with a grin : " My understanding of a chaperon is a person whose job is to keep two people apart . Your job is to get the parties together . " <P> " Words , Just Words . " For three days , usually with Hammarskjold just listening , the three foreign ministers talked in the skyscraper suite . The Westerners felt that they were getting Fawzi to concede little . " Words , just words , " blurted discouraged Christian Pineau on leaving one session . Said another diplomat : " Fawzi is conducting a striptease , but so far he has n't shown an inch of skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bargainers and reducing them to essentials . <P> <P> When the ministers met on the fourth day , Hammarskjold laid before them a set of six principles on which a negotiation of the Suez case could proceed . " Gentlemen , what do you think of this ? " he asked . For another three hours the ministers talked , quibbled , phrased and rephrased . By late afternoon they had agreed . Then the Security Council was summoned back into full session , and Dag Hammarskjold read out the six principles on which the three foreign ministers had agreed : <P> 1 ) no discrimination against transit , through the canal ; <P> 2 ) respect for Egypt 's sovereignty ; <P> 3 ) insulation of canal operations from the politics of any country ; <P> 4 ) tolls to be decided by agreement between Egypt and the users ; <P> 5 ) allocation of a " fair proportion " of dues for canal developments ; <P> 6 ) arbitration of the sum to be paid the expropriated Suez Canal Company . <P> The key point seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of a just settlement . <P>
