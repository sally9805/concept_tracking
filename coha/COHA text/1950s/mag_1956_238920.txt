In Parliament , on editorial pages and in private discussions , a great debate is in progress about the heavy flow of U.S. investments into Canada . Most Canadians welcome the foreign capital , regarding it as an essential loan for national development which the rich young country will eventually pay off . But some fear that foreign investors are gradually gaining too much control over the Canadian economy . Last week the government 's Bureau of Statistics shed some light on the issue by publishing a 93-page blue book reviewing Canadian economic trends in the quarter century from 1926 to 1954 . <P> Fears of foreign economic domination of Canada are largely dispelled by the government 's survey . Although big U.S. investments are coming into the country , Canada 's international debtor position is steadily improving . In 1926 Canadians owed $6 abroad for every $1 of their external assets . Today the external debt has shrunk to about $2 for every dollar of assets outside the country . <P> Optimists about Canada 's economic future have long expected that it would follow the same pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , primed the nation 's industrial development and was eventually bought out almost 100% by American investors . The same trend has already begun in Canada , the Bureau of Statistics survey showed . Canadian ownership of government bonds and of stocks in Canadian railways , utilities , banks and insurance companies has grown markedly since 1926 . <P> With Canadians taking over an evergrowing share of these relatively conservative investments , U.S. investors have tended in recent years to plunge on more speculative enterprises . The recent inflow of American capital has mainly gone into Canada 's oil industry , mining and new manufacturing plants . But here too , the inexorable trend toward local ownership is already under way . In the past ten years , Canadian investors have increased their stock holdings in U.S.-controlled companies operating in Canada by more than 25%.
