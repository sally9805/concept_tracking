Illustrated by Freas This , be it understood , is fiction -- nothing but fiction -- and not , under any circumstances , to be considered as having any truth whatever to it . It 's obviously utterly impossible ... is n't it ? An interview with Dr. I. M. Niemand , Director of the Psychophysical Institute of Solar and Terrestrial Relations , Camarillo , California . In the closing days of December , 1957 , at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New York , Dr. Niemand delivered a paper entitled simply , " On the Nature of the Solar S-Regions . " Owing to its unassuming title the startling implications contained in the paper were completely overlooked by the press . These implications are discussed here in an exclusive interview with Dr. Niemand by Philip Latham . LATHAM . Dr. Niemand , what would you say is your main job ? NIEMAND . I suppose you might say my main job today is to find out all I can between activity on the Sun and various forms of activity on the Earth . LATHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? NIEMAND . Well , a sunspot is a form of solar activity . LATHAM . Just what is a sunspot ? NIEMAND . I 'm afraid I ca n't say just what a sunspot is . I can only describe it . A sunspot is a region on the Sun that is cooler than its surroundings . That 's why it looks dark . It is n't so hot . Therefore not so bright . LATHAM . Is n't it true that the number of spots on the Sun rises and falls in a cycle of eleven years ? NIEMAND . The number of spots on the Sun rises and falls in a cycle of about eleven years . That word about makes quite a difference . LATHAM . In what way ? NIEMAND . It means you can only approximately predict the future course of sunspot activity . Sunspots are mighty treacherous things . LATHAM . Have n't there been a great many correlations announced between sunspots and various effects on the Earth ? NIEMAND . Scores of them . LATHAM . What is your opinion of these correlations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But some are valid ? NIEMAND . A few . There is unquestionably a correlation between sunspots and disturbances of the Earth 's magnetic field ... radio fade-outs ... auroras ... things like that . LATHAM . Now , Dr. Niemand , I understand that you have been investigating solar and terrestrial relationships along rather unorthodox lines . NIEMAND . Yes , I suppose some people would say so . LATHAM . You have broken new ground ? NIEMAND . That 's true . LATHAM . In what way have your investigations differed from those of others ? NIEMAND . I think our biggest advance was the discovery that sunspots themselves are not the direct cause of the disturbances we have been studying on the Earth . It 's something like the eruptions in rubeola . Attention is concentrated on the bright red papules because they 're such a conspicuous symptom of the disease . Whereas the real cause is an invisible filterable virus . In the solar case it turned out to be these S-Regions . LATHAM . Why S-Regions ? NIEMAND . We had to call them something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You say an S-Region is invisible ? NIEMAND . It is quite invisible to the eye but readily detected by suitable instrumental methods . It is extremely doubtful , however , if the radiation we detect is the actual cause of the disturbing effects observed . LATHAM . Just what are these effects ? NIEMAND . Well , they 're common enough , goodness knows . As old as the world , in fact . Yet strangely enough it 's hard to describe them in exact terms . LATHAM . Can you give us a general idea ? NIEMAND . I 'll try . Let 's see ... remember that speech from " Julius Caesar " where Cassius is bewailing the evil times that beset ancient Rome ? I believe it went like this : " The fault , dear Brutus , is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings . " LATHAM . I 'm afraid I do n't see --  NIEMAND . Well , Shakespeare would have been nearer the truth if he had put it the other way around . " The fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars " or better " in the Sun . " * * * * * LATHAM . In the Sun ? NIEMAND . That 's right , in the Sun . I suppose the oldest problem in the world is the origin of human evil . Philosophers have wrestled with it ever since the days of Job . And like Job they have usually given up in despair , convinced that the origin of evil is too deep for the human mind to solve . Generally they have concluded that man is inherently wicked and sinful and that is the end of it . Now for the first time science has thrown new light on this subject . LATHAM . How is that ? NIEMAND . Consider the record of history . There are occasional periods when conditions are fairly calm and peaceful . Art and industry flourished . Man at last seemed to be making progress toward some higher goal . Then suddenly -- for no detectable reason -- conditions are reversed . Wars rage . People go mad . The world is plunged into an orgy of bloodshed and misery . LATHAM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LATHAM . Well , disputes over boundaries ... economic rivalry ... border incidents .... NIEMAND . Nonsense . Men always make some flimsy excuse for going to war . The truth of the matter is that men go to war because they want to go to war . They ca n't help themselves . They are impelled by forces over which they have no control . By forces outside of themselves . LATHAM . Those are broad , sweeping statements . Ca n't you be more specific ? NIEMAND . Perhaps I 'd better go back to the beginning . Let me see .... It all started back in March , 1955 , when I started getting patients suffering from a complex of symptoms , such as profound mental depression , anxiety , insomnia , alternating with fits of violent rage and resentment against life and the world in general . These people were deeply disturbed . No doubt about that . Yet they were not psychotic and hardly more than mildly neurotic . Now every doctor gets a good many patients of this type . Such a syndrome is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these people failed to fit into this picture . They were married and single persons of both sexes and of all ages . They came from all walks of life . The onset of their attack was invariably sudden and with scarcely any warning . They would be going about their work feeling perfectly all right . Then in a minute the whole world was like some scene from a nightmare . A week or ten days later the attack would cease as mysteriously as it had come and they would be their old self again . LATHAM . Are n't such attacks characteristic of the stress and strain of modern life ? NIEMAND . I 'm afraid that old stress-and-strain theory has been badly overworked . Been hearing about it ever since I was a pre-med student at UCLA . Even as a boy I can remember my grandfather deploring the stress and strain of modern life when he was a country doctor practicing in Indiana . In my opinion one of the most valuable contributions anthropologists have made in recent years is the discovery that primitive man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who live a so-called civilized life . They have found savages displaying every symptom of a nervous breakdown among the mountain tribes of the Elgonyi and the Aruntas of Australia . No , Mr. Latham , it 's time the stress-and-strain theory was relegated to the junk pile along with demoniac possession and blood letting . LATHAM . You must have done something for your patients --  NIEMAND . A doctor must always do something for the patients who come to his office seeking help . First I gave them a thorough physical examination . I turned up some minor ailments -- a slight heart murmur or a trace of albumin in the urine -- but nothing of any significance . On the whole they were a remarkably healthy bunch of individuals , much more so than an average sample of the population . Then I made a searching inquiry into their personal life . Here again I drew a blank . They had no particular financial worries . Their sex life was generally satisfactory . There was no history of mental illness in the family . In fact , the only thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were times when they felt like hell . LATHAM . I suppose you tried tranquilizers ? NIEMAND . Oh , yes . In a few cases in which I tried tranquilizing pills of the meprobamate type there was some slight improvement . I want to emphasize , however , that I do not believe in prescribing shotgun remedies for a patient . To my way of thinking it is a lazy slipshod way of carrying on the practice of medicine . The only thing for which I do give myself credit was that I asked my patients to keep a detailed record of their symptoms taking special care to note the time of exacerbation -- increase in the severity of the symptoms -- as accurately as possible . LATHAM . And this gave you a clue ? NIEMAND . It was the beginning . In most instances patients reported the attack struck with almost the impact of a physical blow . The prodromal symptoms were usually slight ... a sudden feeling of uneasiness and guilt ... hot and cold flashes ... dizziness ... double vision . Then this ghastly sense of depression coupled with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt as if the world were closing in on him . Another that he felt the people around him were plotting his destruction . One housewife made her husband lock her in her room for fear she would injure the children . I pored over these case histories for a long time getting absolutely nowhere . Then finally a pattern began to emerge . * * * * * LATHAM . What sort of pattern ? NIEMAND . The first thing that struck me was that the attacks all occurred during the daytime , between the hours of about seven in the morning and five in the evening . Then there were these coincidences --  LATHAM . Coincidences ? NIEMAND . Total strangers miles apart were stricken at almost the same moment . At first I thought nothing of it but as my records accumulated I became convinced it could not be attributed to chance . A mathematical analysis showed the number of coincidences followed a Poisson distribution very closely . I could n't possibly see what daylight had to do with it . There is some evidence that mental patients are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a search of medical literature failed to reveal any connection with the Sun . LATHAM . What did you do ? NIEMAND . Naturally I said nothing of this to my patients . I did , however , take pains to impress upon them the necessity of keeping an exact record of the onset of an attack . The better records they kept the more conclusive was the evidence . Men and women were experiencing nearly simultaneous attacks of rage and depression all over southern California , which was as far as my practice extended . One day it occurred to me : if people a few miles apart could be stricken simultaneously , why not people hundreds or thousands of miles apart ? It was this idea that prompted me to get in touch with an old colleague of mine I had known at UC medical school , Dr. Max Hillyard , who was in practice in Utica , New York . LATHAM . With what result ? NIEMAND . I was afraid the result would be that my old roommate would think I had gone completely crazy . Imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail to the effect that he also had been getting an increasing number of patients suffering with the same identical symptoms as my own . Furthermore , upon exchanging records we did find that in many cases patients three thousand miles apart had been stricken simultaneously --  LATHAM . Just a minute . I would like to know how you define " simultaneous . " NIEMAND . We say an attack is simultaneous when one occurred on the east coast , for example , not earlier or later than five minutes of an attack on the west coast . That is about as close as you can hope to time a subjective effect of this nature . And now another fact emerged which gave us another clue . LATHAM . Which was ? NIEMAND . In every case of a simultaneous attack the Sun was shining at both New York and California . LATHAM . You mean if it was cloudy --  NIEMAND . No , no . The weather had nothing to do with it . I mean the Sun had to be above the horizon at both places . A person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there would be no corresponding record of an attack in California where it was still dark . Conversely , a person might be stricken late in the afternoon in California without a corresponding attack in New York where the Sun had set . Dr. Hillyard and I had been searching desperately for a clue . We had both noticed that the attacks occurred only during the daylight hours but this had not seemed especially significant . Here we had evidence pointing directly to the source of trouble . It must have some connection with the Sun . LATHAM . That must have had you badly puzzled at first . NIEMAND . It certainly did . It looked as if we were headed back to the Middle Ages when astrology and medicine went hand in hand . But since it was our only lead we had no other choice but to follow it regardless of the consequences . Here luck played somewhat of a part , for Hillyard happened to have a contact that proved invaluable to us . Several years before Hillyard had gotten to know a young astrophysicist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severe case of myositis in the arms and shoulders . Hillyard had been able to effect a complete cure for which the boy was very grateful , and they had kept up a desultory correspondence . Middletown was now specializing in radio astronomy at the government 's new solar observatory on Turtle Back Mountain in Arizona . If it had not been for Middletown 's help I 'm afraid our investigation would never have gotten past the clinical stage . LATHAM . In what way was Middletown of assistance ? NIEMAND . It was the old case of workers in one field of science being completely ignorant of what was going on in another field . Someday we will have to establish a clearing house in science instead of keeping it in tight little compartments as we do at present . Well , Hillyard and I packed up for Arizona with considerable misgivings . We were afraid Middletown would n't take our findings seriously but somewhat to our surprise he heard our story with the closest attention . I guess astronomers have gotten so used to hearing from flying saucer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we had finished he asked to see our records . Hillyard had them all set down for easy numerical tabulation . Middletown went to work with scarcely a word . Within an hour he had produced a chart that was simply astounding. * * * * * LATHAM . Can you describe this chart for us ? NIEMAND . It was really quite simple . But if it had not been for Middletown 's experience in charting other solar phenomena it would never have occurred to us to do it . First , he laid out a series of about thirty squares horizontally across a sheet of graph paper . He dated these beginning March 1 , 1955 , when our records began . In each square he put a number from 1 to 10 that was a rough index of the number and intensity of the attacks reported on that day . Then he laid out another horizontal row below the first one dated twenty-seven days later . That is , the square under March 1st in the top row was dated March 28th in the row below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an array of dozens of rows that included all our data down to May , 1958 . When Middletown had finished it was easy to see that the squares of highest index number did not fall at random on the chart . Instead they fell in slightly slanting parallel series so that you could draw straight lines down through them . The connection with the Sun was obvious . LATHAM . In what way ? NIEMAND . Why , because twenty-seven days is about the synodic period of solar rotation . That is , if you see a large spot at the center of the Sun 's disk today , there is a good chance if it survives that you will see it at the same place twenty-seven days later . But that night Middletown produced another chart that showed the connection with the Sun in a way that was even more convincing . LATHAM . How was that ? NIEMAND . I said that the lines drawn down through the days of greatest mental disturbance slanted slightly . On this second chart the squares were dated under one another not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-seven point three days . LATHAM . Why is that so important ? NIEMAND . Because the average period of solar rotation in the sunspot zone is not twenty-seven days but twenty-seven point three days . And on this chart the lines did not slant but went vertically downward . The correlation with the synodic rotation of the Sun was practically perfect . LATHAM . But how did you get onto the S-Regions ? NIEMAND . Middletown was immediately struck by the resemblance between the chart of mental disturbance and one he had been plotting over the years from his radio observations . Now when he compared the two charts the resemblance between the two was unmistakable . The pattern shown by the chart of mental disturbance corresponded in a striking way with the solar chart but with this difference . The disturbances on the Earth started two days later on the average than the disturbances due to the S-Regions on the Sun . In other words , there was a lag of about forty-eight hours between the two . But otherwise they were almost identical . LATHAM . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect them ? NIEMAND . The S-Regions are invisible to the eye through an optical telescope , but are detected with ease by a radio telescope . Middletown had discovered them when he was a graduate student working on radio astronomy in Australia , and he had followed up his researches with the more powerful equipment at Turtle Back Mountain . The formation of an S-Region is heralded by a long series of bursts of a few seconds duration , when the radiation may increase up to several thousand times that of the background intensity . These noise storms have been recorded simultaneously on wavelengths of from one to fifteen meters , which so far is the upper limit of the observations . In a few instances , however , intense bursts have also been detected down to fifty cm . LATHAM . I believe you said the periods of mental disturbance last for about ten or twelve days . How does that tie-in with the S-Regions ? NIEMAND . Very closely . You see it takes about twelve days for an S-Region to pass across the face of the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LATHAM . I should think it would be nearer thirteen or fourteen days . NIEMAND . Apparently an S-Region is not particularly effective when it is just coming on or just going off the disk of the Sun . LATHAM . Are the S-Regions associated with sunspots ? NIEMAND . They are connected in this way : that sunspot activity and S-Region activity certainly go together . The more sunspots the more violent and intense is the S-Region activity . But there is not a one-to-one correspondence between sunspots and S-Regions . That is , you can not connect a particular sunspot group with a particular S-Region . The same thing is true of sunspots and magnetic storms . LATHAM . How do you account for this ? NIEMAND . We do n't account for it . * * * * * LATHAM . What other properties of the S-Regions have you discovered ? NIEMAND . Middletown says that the radio waves emanating from them are strongly circularly polarized . Moreover , the sense of rotation remains constant while one is passing across the Sun . If the magnetic field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through which the rays pass , then the sense of rotation corresponds to the ordinary ray of the magneto-ionic theory . LATHAM . Does this mean that the mental disturbances arise from some form of electromagnetic radiation ? NIEMAND . We doubt it . As I said before , the charts show a lag of about forty-eight hours between the development of an S-Region and the onset of mental disturbance . This indicates that the malignant energy emanating from an S-Region consists of some highly penetrating form of corpuscular radiation , as yet unidentified . A Footnote A : Middletown believes that the Intense radiation recently discovered from information derived from Explorer I and III has no connection with the corpuscular S-radiation . LATHAM . A question that puzzles me is why some people are affected by the S-Regions while others are not . NIEMAND . Our latest results indicate that probably no one is completely immune . All are affected in some degree . Just why some should be affected so much more than others is still a matter of speculation . LATHAM . How long does an S-Region last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from three to perhaps a dozen solar rotations . Then it dies out and for a time we are free from this malignant radiation . Then a new region develops in perhaps an entirely different region of the Sun . Sometimes there may be several different S-Regions all going at once . LATHAM . Why were not the S-Regions discovered long ago ? NIEMAND . Because the radio exploration of the Sun only began since the end of World War II . LATHAM . How does it happen that you only got patients suffering from S-radiation since about 1955 ? NIEMAND . I think we did get such patients previously but not in large enough numbers to attract attention . Also the present sunspot cycle started its rise to maximum about 1954 . LATHAM . Is there no way of escaping the S-radiation ? NIEMAND . I 'm afraid the only sure way is to keep on the unilluminated side of the Earth which is rather difficult to do . Apparently the corpuscular beam from an S-Region is several degrees wide and not very sharply defined , since its effects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working on some form of shielding device but so far without success . LATHAM . What is the present state of S-Region activity ? NIEMAND . At the present moment there happens to be no S-Region activity on the Sun . But a new one may develop at any time . Also , the outlook for a decrease in activity is not very favorable . Sunspot activity continues at a high level and is steadily mounting in violence . The last sunspot cycle had the highest maximum of any since 1780 , but the present cycle bids fair to set an all time record . LATHAM . And so you believe that the S-Regions are the cause of most of the present trouble in the world . That it is not ourselves but something outside ourselves --  NIEMAND . That is the logical outcome of our investigation . We are controlled and swayed by forces which in many cases we are powerless to resist . LATHAM . Could we not be warned of the presence of an S-Region ? NIEMAND . The trouble is they seem to develop at random on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worse than useless . We would be crying WOLF ! all the time . LATHAM . How may a person who is not particularly susceptible to this malignant radiation know that one of these regions is active ? NIEMAND . If you have a feeling of restlessness and anxiety , if you are unable to concentrate , if you feel suddenly depressed and discouraged about yourself , or are filled with resentment toward the world , then you may be pretty sure that an S-Region is passing across the face of the Sun . Keep a tight rein on yourself . For it seems that evil will always be with us ... as long as the Sun shall continue to shine upon this little world . THE END
