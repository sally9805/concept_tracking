txt Two prominent witnesses before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee joined today in attacking the Administration 's liberal mortgage - lending policy and lack of control over consumer credit . They also agreed that there were elements of danger in the recent sharp rise in stock prices . One witness was Marriner S. Eccles , for fourteen years chairman of the Federal Reserve Board under Presidents Roosevelt and Truman . The other was John J. McCloy , chairimn of the board of the Chase National Bank of the City of New York . They testified in the committee 's friendly study of the stock market . Mr. Eccles not only attacked a seeming inconsistency between the Government 's credit and fiscal policies , but also presented a plan for action . Its major feature was a proposal for dropping the rate of the tax on capital gains  --  profits from the sale of capital assets  --  as the holding period was lengthened and wiping it out eventually . " There are soft spots in the economy , " Mr. McCloy said . " I think the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with homes , have some elements of concern in them . I do n't say it 's a soft spot , but I am constantly wondering ' whether the level of consumer ' debt is healthy . " 30 Billion in Consumer Debt Robert A. Wallace , . head of the committee 's staff , said that the aggregate of rons7mier credit ? which includes in riient. loans , charge accounts and per- ' sonal loans  --  had risen in 1954 ifrom $29,500,000,000 to $39,125 , - 1000,000 . " The consumer loan figure is high , " Mr. McCloy said , " and creates some concern on my part . ' It is a fact that we have n't had any difficulty in the collection of consumer loans . They seem to be well maintained  --  but they were n't compromised in 1929 , either . But the general level of debt is to me personally a matter of some concern . " Mr. Eccles called attention to the " paradoxical situation " of a booming stock matket and " excessive construction activity " on the one hand and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production on the other . . There are estimates now , he said , that the gross national product  --  the sum of goods and services produced by the economy  --  for this year will approximate that for 1953 ? $364,900 , - 000,000 . But , Mr. Eccles added , the growth in the labor force , productive facilities and productivity should shove the gross national product $15,000,000,000 to $20,000,000,000 above 1953 without inflation . He opposed further monetary or credit restrictions by the . Federal Reserve Board . He believed that the Treasury should not at this time refund its maturing debt , which is largely held by commercial banks , into longterm securities . Such securities , he added , are usually bought by individual and institutional investors , while short-term , bills and notes are taken up Mostly by commercial banks . A refunding of bank-held investments into long-term securities can be deflationary because it tends to reduce the money supply . This is no time to reduce the money supply , Mr. Eccles declared . Mortgage Curbs Urged He said there should be more restrictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veterans ' Administration ) housing loans , with down payments of at least 5 per cent and repayment terms running not more than twenty-five years . ' They now run thirty years , and there ' are no down payments on G. I. loans . Mr. Eccles also asked that the open-end mortgage feature on loans of both kinds be eliminated . With an open-end mortgage , more funds can be borrowed as more assets are added to the mortgaged property . The former Reserve Board head said that new housing starts were estimated for 1955 at 1,400,000 or " practically double the estimated family formation , " and that home mortgage debt incurred in 1954 was $9,300,000,000 . " Growth of mortgage debt is exceeding available investment funds , " he said . " Therefore increasing amounts are financed directly or indirectly by commercial banks . This is unsound under present conditions . " Although the housing boom is now the greatest support of the economy , Mr. Eccles declared , it is " largely sustained by a rapid growth of debt of the niddle and low-income group . E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ? . conomic consequences to the whole economy . " Mr. Eccles said that the Federal Reserve Board should " promptly " increase margin requirements on securities loans ? the amount an invester must put up in cash or equal values to buy stocks  --  to " at least 75 per cent . " If stocks continue to rise , he added , the margin requirement should be raised " ultimately " to 100 per cent . The margin requirement now is 60 per cent . " As a matter of fact , " he declared , " they margins should never have been reduced in Fen- , ruary , 1953 , when a restrictive monetary and debt management policy was being pursued by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury . That was a reversal of the general monetary and fiscal policy . It looks as though the stock market was being favored . " Assets must now be held for six months before profits made from their sale are taxable not at ordinary incomes rates , but at capital gain tax rates . These are now at a maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider a law to increase this initial holding period from six months to one year , with a 25 per cent tax applicable . The tax then would drop to 20 per cent for profits on assets held for two years and be graduated downward " until a taxfree status is ultimately reached . " He also called for legislation dealing with the over-the-counter market  --  where stocks not sold on the registered exchanges are traded . The over - the - counter market " is now entirely unregulated and could no doubt be improved in the public interest , " he declared . Mr. Eccles said that reducing or eliminating the use of credit in securities deals would deter speculators , but not real investors . The rapid increase in the prices of stocks in the last year , he asserted , indicates the need for further control of stock market credit , since it was supported by a growth of more than $800,000,000 in loans made by brokers . No ' Perpetual Bull Market ' " There can not be a perpetual bull rising market , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop unchecked , just so much more painful the decline will be , with adverse effects on the economy in general . " Only the speculator , not the investor , Mr. Eccles insisted , need be disturbed by the proposed chance in the capital gains tax law . " Nor do I believe , " he added , ? that the Government would lose much , - if any , revenue by such a change , and it would assure the availability of the more desirable securities at realistic prices . " To restrict housing credit would be inflationary , he said . So might the limitations on stock market credit . ** would compensate with a program of roan buildielg , to- ba paid for by taxes and toils , and by Federal financial assistance for the building g of schools . Mr. Eccles also favored some reduction in taxes at a level where it would be reflected in increased purchasing power and lessen the need for consumer credit . The proposed $20 income tax cut , he said , may be a political measure , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " economically sound . " " I would favor such a tax reduction , however , only on condition the housing mortgage terms were restricted as suggested and further credit curbs applied to the stock market , " he asserted . Replying to questions by Senator J. William Fulbright , Democrat of Arkansas , chairman of the committee , Mr. Eccles said that the wild stampede into house building had been almost entirely due to the too liberal credit terms , certainly not to a great availability of lendable funds . Mr. Eccles said that he found gross inconsistencies in the Administration 's proposals for housing and road-building programs , while the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board were talking about a restricted credit policy . Selling bonds with long-term redemption dates , he said , will reduce the supply of money at a time when low money rates are needed to finance the building programs . A contraction of credit , he had found , always tended to reduce production and employment . And ' there is a good deal of unemployment already , he said . Senator Herbert H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eccles on housing . He pointed to slum clearance and public housing . Mr. Eccles said that neither of these was involved in t1 criticisms . He added that " I 'd like to see housing starts down to 1,000,000 or 1,100,000 a year , not 1,300,000 or 1,400,000 . " McCloy Warns on Stock Rise Mr. McCloy corrected a number of impressions created by earlier testimony . The Chase Bank , he said , does not invest personal trust and pension trust funds exclusively in " blue chips " the stocks of the largest and soundest companies . Only a third of the funds are placed in such issues , he said . Neither , he added , do such trust funds merely withdraw stocks from circulation . Last year there was considerable activity in and out , he declared , and Chase Bank trust accounts sold more than they bought . " If you will accept the view of an ' inexpert , ' " Mr. McCloy said , " I feel that the steepness of the stock market rise over a short period is a matter for caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent rise in the stock market , rather than the levels to which stocks had climbed , indicated a need for caution . He added that there was " an element of agreement " between his views and those of Prof. John Kenneth Galbraith , Harvard University economist , expressed at an earlier session of the committee , that there was evidence of too much speculative activity . Mr. McCloy however , opposed putting securities deals on an all-cash basis , though he would prefer to leave that matter to the judgment of the Federal Reserve Board . Senator Fulbright asked if it would not be healthy for the economy to minimize or prevent serious setbacks by small continuing adjustments . Mr. McCloy replied that it would , adding that there was no reason to believe that a wild burst of speculation was inevitable . The country should try to avoid it , as it tries to avoid war , he added . Asked about the advisability of increasing interest rates generally as a cure for overspecula- tion , Mr. McCloy however , opposed putting securities deals on an tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a minor target . " While he does not like the capital gains tax , he said , he would oppose reducing it and placing the burden " on the shoulders of the already overburdened earner . " " Somebody has to be responsible for defense and other things and that somebody has gec to pay the bill , " he added . Senator Fulbright asked whether the growth of institutional investors  --  union pension funds , investment trusts , foundations , endowments and other trustee accounts  --  was putting a new class of owners into control of the biggest corporations . Mr. McCloy admitted that the Chase Bank voted the stock it held in trust funds as it believed wise in the great majority of cases . He emphasized , however , that institutional investors generally try to avoid getting into positions of control . They would rather sell the securities than fight if they lost confidence in the management , he said . Senator Fulbright noted , and Mr. McCloy agreed , that " someone with a more ambitious and aggressive nature could well take advantage of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
