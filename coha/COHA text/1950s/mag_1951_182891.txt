Nobody ever accused cocky Joe Cul-mone or quiet Willie Shoemaker of being a great jockey , but both boys know how to bring horses into the winner 's circle . Six weeks ago , the figure-minded racing world noted with considerable respect that both of them had breezed right by the modern U.S. record of 319 wins in one year . Last week , on the next-to-last day of the year , Jockeys Shoemaker and Cul-mone hit the wire in a dead heat , with 385 winners apiece-just three short of the alltime mark set by Walter Miller in 1906. * <P> Since no U.S. tracks operate on Sunday , the two dead-heat kids spent Dec. 31 on foreign tracks . Culmone flew from Miami to Cuba 's Oriental Park , rode in all eight races and booted home 3 winners . Shoemaker hopped a plane from New Orleans to Mexico 's Agua Caliente , rode in eleven races there , also got home with 3 winners . Result : a triple dead heat with Miller at 388 . <P> <P> Mrs. Dodge SIoane 's Brookmeade Farms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the top money-winning stable of 1950 ( total : $651,249 ) , breaking the four-year leadership of Calumet Farm . <P> <P> * Miller , who was the Eddie Arcaro of his day , won with 28% of his 1,384 mounts that year . No such ability was required of 1950 's record-breakers : Shoemaker had a 24% winning average with 1,634 mounts , Culmone 23% with 1,674.
