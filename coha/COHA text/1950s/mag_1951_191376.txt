The news hit Paducah ( pop . 32,430 ) like a double shot of bourbon . Said one excited Kentucky housewife : " It 'll make the whole town go haywire . " The news : the Atomic Energy Commission was going to build a $500 million plant to make uranium 235 on a 5,000-acre site 16 miles west of the city , and Paducah would soon be swarming with well-heeled construction workers , perhaps as many as 10,000 of them . <P> To do the enormous building job and install the complex production equipment , AEC picked F. H. McGraw &; Co. of Hartford , Conn. , gave it a contract for $350 million , biggest single Government contract ever handed a private construction firm . AEC thought that McGraw was just the outfit to handle the project . In 21 years of building all over the world , McGraw has put up nearly $500 million worth of steel mills , naval bases , ammunition plants , etc . <P> Piano in Cellophane . Boss of McGraw is tough , scrappy Clifford Strike , 48 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ( 6 ft. , 210 Ibs. ) frame . He worked his way through the University of Illinois ' mechanical engineering course , and put in six years on construction jobs before he joined McGraw in 1930 as assistant vice president . <P> The company , founded only a year be fore by veteran Builder Frank McGraw - who had $17 million in contracts the day he opened his office - soon ran out of work in the depression . By 1932 , says Strike , " the firm was whittled down to a half-dozen of us . " But Frank McGraw had confidence in young Cliff Strike , let him run most of the construction jobs himself when business picked up again . Strike , in turn , gave his top supervisors a free hand and everything they asked for in the way of men and equipment . ( " Even if you want a baby grand piano wrapped in Cellophane , you 'll get it , but you 'd damn well better need it . " ) <P> Tanks in Water . Cliff Strike also has a sharp engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away three oil tanks in Hartford , competing contractors estimated it would take six months and $65,000 to put them back in place again . McGraw &; Co. took on the job for $13,000 , did it in seven days by aping nature . Strike built a dike around the tanks , refloated them and easily put them back into position . <P> By 1941 McGraw , 70 years old , was taking a less active part in the company , and Strike was president . For his wartime job of building close to $175 million in war plants and bases , Engineer Strike became so well known that the War Depart ment sent him to Europe to supervise the rebuilding of German industry and the housing of some 4,000,000 homeless Germans . He did a bang-up job , and the Government sent him to Japan on a similar task . Later he became president of Overseas Consultants Inc. , an eleven-firm , nonprofit combine which mapped out a $650 million development program for Iran ( TIME , Oct. 24 , 1949 ) . <P> Last year , when a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors gave Cliff Strike no more than an hour to live ( his wife was killed in the crash ) . But in two months he was back at his desk again , putting in a full day 's work and hustling around the country by plane from job to job .
