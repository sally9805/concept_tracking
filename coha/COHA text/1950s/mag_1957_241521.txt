On a bluff overlooking Lake Michigan , Milwaukee has just built one of the country 's finest examples of modern architecture put to work for civic purposes . It is a new Memorial Center , designed by Architect Eero Saarinen ( TIME , July 2 , 1956 ) , combining quarters for veterans ' services and a new home for the Milwaukee Art Institute in an open , dramatically cantilevered structure built for $2,700,000 . In its first five weeks of full operation , the Memorial Center has already added new zest to community life and revitalized art interest in the city . The Art Institute 's housewarming show-some $3,000,000 worth of masterworks by El Greco , Rembrandt , Goya , Czanne , Van Gogh and Picasso-drew a record turnout of 53,031 visitors , more than the museum in its old headquarters could normally expect in a whole year . <P> After the Fireworks . " The Problem now , " says the Art Institute 's director , Edward H. Dwight , 38 , " is to keep them coming . " Director D wight can apparently count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It just insists that you wander in , " said one Milwaukeean . When the city staged a fireworks celebration for its World Series-winning Braves last month in front of the Memorial Center , some 7,100 celebrators decided to take in the art show . Many of them had never been in an art gallery . <P> The problem posed to Architect Saarinen in planning the center was far from simple . He had to design a monumental building of many uses that would at the same time be the gateway to a park and the lakefront symbol of the city . His answer was to keep the main floor open , se that a visitor entering from the upper level , off Lincoln Memorial Drive , can see through to the lake beyond , thus providing a visual link between city and lake . To give the building sweep and drama , he designed soaring , 30-ft. cantilevers for the upper stories , which house meeting rooms and a two-story memorial hall . <P> Within , Memorial Center is designed around an open central-courtyard plaza . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixtures have been built into the ceiling to turn the building into a blazing beacon at night , but Architect Saarinen broke with the modern tendency to seal off gallery space from outside light , left two wide glass areas so that the lake can be kept in view even while looking at pictures . <P> Into the Majors . Milwaukee is steamed up over its new Memorial Center . Art lovers contributed $300,000 to stage its first show , are now planning to raise another $250,000 to build a second gallery below the present museum area . With interest and enthusiasm running high , Director Dwight now sees a chance to parlay the new building into a major art museum , one that will lift Milwaukee into the major-league category in art to equal its standing in baseball and beer .
