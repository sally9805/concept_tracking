THE Augean stables , containing 3,000 oxen , had not been cleaned for thirty years . Hercules , it will be recalled , cleaned them in a day by turning in the rivers Alpheus and Peneus . The Democrats have not been in power thirty years , but Mr. Truman has decided that influence peddlers and corrupt officials shall be driven from government and party positions whether they number thirty or thirty thousand . He has chosen Frank E. McKinney , an Indianapolis banker , for the task , on the assumption , apparently , that the Democratic machine politicians of Indianapolis are a different breed from those of St. Louis , the hOme of William Boyle . But just what manner of man is this Hercules from Indiana ? Frank E. McKinney may clean up and patch the scandal-scarred Democratic Party , but he will not be of much help to the Democrats in carrying Indiana ; in fact , he will probably find it a tougher job to increase the Democratic vote in. his home town than anywhere else . Long before he was chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball , magnate and business man with political connections galore . Less than twenty-four hours after he had succeeded the much-investigated William Boyle as Democratic National Chairman , the skeletons in his political past began to be paraded . The first of them had to do , of course , with the casual way in which McKinney and his political sponsor , Frank McHale , Indiana 's Democratic National Committeeman , had picked up a small fortune through their association with Frank Cohen , the New York promoter whose Empire Ordnance Company was one of the most frequently investigated and thoroughly criticized munitions combines of World War II . The fact that Empire had been exposed by the Truman committee apparently failed to embarrass either McKinney or President Truman . Frank McKinney 's banking , business , and political connections in Indiana can not be understood without inquiring into his Republican as well as his Democratic connections . McKinney is known to be the political prot  --  g ? of Frank McHale . Not known to most rank-andfile Democrats in Indiana is the fact that McHale is attorney for the Indianapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recently , the Star assailed as a " dictator " Indiana 's popular Democratic Governor , Henry F. Schricker , the only man in the state 's history to IRVING LEIBOIVITZ is on the staff of the Indianapolis Times . BY IRVING LEIBOWITZ be twice elected to the governorship ; Schricker , incidentally , detests the political maneuvers of McHale . McKinney and McHale started their climb to political power and private wealth during the early days of the New Deal , when Paul McNutt was Governor of Indiana . McNutt personally guided their careers until he left Indiana to become Federal Security Administrator , Governor of the Philippines and then ambassador to the new republic , and , currently , a big-time lawyer-lobbyist whose clients have included the South Korean Republic . Through McNutt solid top-level connections in the Democratic Party were established by McKinney and McHale . In the Republican Party , McKinney 's connections are on a much lower level but are by no means negligible . Many Indiana Democrats are disturbed by his elevation to the national chairmanship of the party less because he is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political influence than because of his unusual affinity for Republican politicians . A good many Democrats and Republicans in Indiana insist not only that McKinney was once a Republican but that he started his political career in 1925 by working , as a Republican , for the election of the Ku Klux Klan candidate for Mayor of Indianapolis . Former Mayor John Duvall , who once paraded with the Klan drum corps to accept the Klan 's indorsement , has recalled : The McKinneys were all good Republicans at that time . Frank 's father Roscoe collected $1,000 for my campaign , and Frank campaigned in my behalf . I later helped promote Frank 's father to Battalion Fire Chief and sent him to fire school in New York . " Vigorously denying any connection with ex-Mayor Duvall , McKinney insists that his father did not collect or contribute money to Duvall 's campaign . " How could I as an Irish Catholic support a Klan candidate ? " he asks . " All this is a damn lie . Why , my father was too poor and I was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local Republican big shots . For many years James Bradford , former county chairman , was able to purchase liquor for the now defunct Mid-State Liquor Corporation through loans extended by McKinney 's bank . McKinney and Bradford say these were " regular " commercial loans secured by warehouse receipts . But however regular the loans may have been  --  and there is no reason to question McKinney 's statement about them  --  they are regarded in Indianapolis as further evidence of his dose relations with Republican politicians . Moreover , at the time that McKinney bought control of the bustling Fidelity Trust Company in 1935 , with the aid of a $100 , - 000 loan , he was employed as assistant cashier by the Republican-controlled People 's State Bank . In fact , McKinney 's Republican connections range from friendships and business deals with ward chairmen to a close working alliance with the present Mayor of Indianapolis , Alex Clark . Recently t h e Indianapolis Times , quoting " two reliable sources , " said in a front-page story that McKinney had contributed $1,000 to the local G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . McKinney has denied this . In the highly partisan politics of Indiana , Democrats are supposed to be Democrats and Republicans , Republicans . McKinney and McHale have had such a strangle-hold on the Democratic Party that their bipartisan business and political activities have until recently been overlooked . But a year ago McKinney became embroiled in a torrid political feud with the Democratic Mayor of Indianapolis , the late Al Feeney , and Mayor Feeney publicly accused McKinney of trying to handpick the Democratic ticket in Marion County and attacked him in the newspapers as a " ruthless , power-mad dictator . " When a long list of Democratic city administrations throughout the state were toppled from power in the recent mayoralty elections and 73 of the 103 cities in Indiana , including such normally Democratic industrial cities as Evansville , South Bend , and Indianapolis , went Republican , Indiana Democrats in all walks of life began to talk of ousting the party leadership . A number of prominent labor leaders , regular party Democrats , and state officials are now working to reorganize the party in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent mayoralty results , these leaders are extremely suspicious of the McKinney-McHale alliance . Organized labor , with ' which rests the fate of the Democrats in Indiana next year , has threatened to desert the party unless labor gets a " fair deal " and promises are kept . Labor leaders particularly dislike McHale , who has been quoted as saying : " Labor can go to hell . Where can labor go but the Democratic Party ? " On another occasion he said : " The C. I. 0. -P . A. C. is a millstone around the neck of the Democratic Party . " Neal Edwards , a key figure in the C. I. 0. , and Carl Mullen of the A. F. of L. , who together represent more than 5 0 , - 0 00 trade-union members in Indiana , will not be satisfied with halfway measures . Publicly warning Democratic politicians , Edwards said recently : " The Democrats musthave a. sweeping house-cleaning here in Indiana . There are too many Dixiecrats and reactionaries who have high positions in the party . McHale and company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the methods of McHale and McKinney : " Unless the Democratic Party is reorganized in Indiana from top to bottom , it wo n't be able to elect a dog-catcher next year . " Curiously enough , the steps to reorganize the Democratic Party in Indiana really began when McKinney left for Washington and New York . T HE key factor in the extraordinary career of the forty-seven-year-old McKinney seems to have been his ability to make money . Last year Edwin C. Heinke , then assistant managing editor of the Indianapolis Times and now chief of Time-bfe 's Chicago bureau , wrote that everything McKinney touched turned to gold . The Indiana politician-banker has since been known as Midas McKinney . A banker who never planned or even hoped , so he says , to amass great wealth , he now finds himself the possessor of a large fortune . A politician who found politics " distasteful , " he rose from county treasurer to become one of the most powerful figures in the state . A baseball fan who managed a semi-pro team in his youth for the sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh Pirates . One example of his Midas touch is the way he made between $68,000 and $69,000 on a $1,000 investment in the Empire Tractor Company . Another was his experience as County Treasurer . McKinney was treasurer of Marion County ( Indianapolis ) from 1936 to 1940 . Up to 1936 the treasurer retained 3 per cent of collections on real-property and personal-property delinquencies . That year the legislature raised the fee to 6 per cent plus a 50-cent fee for each delinquency retired . " There is no record of the amount of fees McKinney collected , " reports the Associated Press , " but best estimates are between $30,000 and $40,000 a year  --  possibly more . " The fee system was abolished in 1941 . As McKinney has accumulated wealth , he has accumulated political influence ; there can be no doubt that he has long been a power in the Democratic Party despite his relations with local Republican leaders . This was demonstrated when he personally escorted William Steckler to the White House last year and persuaded President Truman to appoint him to the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event illustrates how McKinney 's interest in politics has seldom gone unrewarded . The first big bankruptcy plum that Judge Steckler had at his disposal  --  the multi-million-dollar resort hotel at French Lick Springs in southern Indiana  --  went to McKinney 's bank , with Frank McHale named attorney in the transaction . State Democratic Chairman Ira Haymaker and his press agent , Robert Bloem , vigorously defend this exchange of courtesies as " practical politics , " and so it was . " Would you have the judge be an ingrate , " they ask , " and give it the bankruptcy appointment to a Republican bank just to satisfy the newspapers ? " Obviously not ; but the fact that Mr. McKinney is so clearly not an " ingrate " in this sense makes one wonder how effective he will be in helping cleanse the Administration and the Democratic Party of " influence peddlers . " Whatever President Truman may think , Indiana Democrats are by no means unanimous in believing that McKinney will put through a clean-up campaign in the Democratic Party or that he will be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They point to the fact , for example , that McKinney 's first official act was to appoint Municipal Court Judge Joseph Howard of Indianapolis as one of his top assistants . Judge Howard was indicted for vote frauds in Marion County on September 16 , 1938 , while serving as deputy prosecutor . Although the indictment was later dismissed , the appointment of Howard did little to convince Indiana Democrats that McKinney intends to clean up the mess he inherited from William Boyle . Both Howard and McKinney , moreover , were accused of actively supporting the Republican candidate for Mayor of Indianapolis , Alex Clark , in the recent election . Howard , in fact , resigned as Democratic ward chairman to work for the Republican candidate . After accepting the Democratic national chairmanship , McKinney made a feeble effort at a preelection rally to swing his support back to the Democratic nominee , Phillip Bayt . Political observers marveled that McKinney had the audacity to send men to the rally with signs advising Democrats : " It 's not too late to be with Bayt . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime than subversive activity , think President Truman did not help the party in Indiana when he selected McKinney as National Chairman .
