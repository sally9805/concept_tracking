txt Legal proceedings are expected to be filed here tomorrow in Federal District Court in an attempt to open the city 's four high schools . This was indicated today by a source within the office of the United States Attorney . However , he declined to say what the action would be and who would file it . The possibility has been raised that the Justice Department may seek to bolster its legal status in the case by becoming a full litigant , but it was doubtful that this would be done tomorrow . Any suit would be heard by Federal District Judge John E. Miller , who came here today from Fort Smith , Ark . The Justice Department staff of legal advisers here is headed by Malcolm R. Wilkey , Assistant United States Attorney General- and legal counsel . Faubus Sees Aides Gov . Orval E. Falibus returned to the iExecutive mansion today from a brief rest ' at the near-by home of friends . He went into conference with his aides shortly after arriving . The Governor , who issued a , proclamation Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next move is up to the Federals . " However , it appeared that move might come from parents and students . There were groWing indications that many of them wanted the schools opened even if it meant complying with the Supreme Court 's ruling on Friday that seven Negroes must be readmitted to Central High School . The other high schools , which apparently will remain closed tomorrow because of the Governor 's action , are Hall , Technical and all-Negro Horace Mann . Hundreds ' Ask Transcripts A source within education circles said " hundreds " of students already had asked for their transcripts to transfer to other high schools outside Little Rock . Parents who are financially unable to send their children away or who have no relatives in other towns with whom they could place their children have started to voice concern over their plight . Several of them have sought advice from attorneys on a solution . They were reported to be considering the possibility of filing suit to force the schools to open . Virgil T. Blossom , district school superintendent , said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been set on the sidelines " ? that this " is a battle of two sovereignties . " Meanwhile , law enforcement authorities made preparations to cope with any disorder . All vacations and leaves ? - were Can-I ceted for the city police . The investigative division of the State Police has been alerted and additional State patrolmen have been called for stand-by.cluty . A force of deputy Federal marshals of an undisclosed number was briefed by Marshal Beal Kidd here . The staff of the Federal Bureau of rthrestigation also was augmented . In his proclamation . closing the schools , Mr. Faubus ordeVed a special election Oct. 7 on the question of whether to open schools on an integrated basis . - There was little doubt as tv what its outcome would be . The new law under which.he acted requires ; that a majority of all qualified voters in the district  --  or about 20.000-must approve such ' a course . No more than 8,000 usually take part : in a school election 1ere . ? However , a legal Source noted That in a decision - some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified voters "  - -  could only mean those voting in - an election . It held ? that this was because deaths and the revision of registration lists make it virtually impossible to tell at any time exactly how many persons are registered .. Outright Evasion Seen If reopening in compliance with the desegregation decree were defeated , then Mr. Faubus has indicated that --  he might lease public school facilities for private purposes . However , the legal source pointed out that onlythe hoard of trustees acting for the Little Rock Special School District could take such a step . - Thist the source said , would be an outright evasion of the Supreme Court order directing the board ? to carry out its plan of gradual desegregation . The education system also faces the loss of accreditation . This could be removed on grounds of a reduced term or an atmosphere unfavorable to education . The , board has requested the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools for an opinion On the situation .                  @ @ @
