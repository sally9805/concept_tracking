txt As the results of the Egyptian elections ch July 3 arc beginning to come in. the most interesting nev s item is one which gets much less play in Egyptian net shapers than the names of those chosen to sit in the new National Assembly , This is the unheralded departure tor Saudi Arabia 01 one of President Nasser 's closest and most trusted associates , his Minister of War and Commander in Chief , Maj. Gen. Abdel Hakim Amer . It has not been officially disclosed why President Nasser has sent General Amer to Saudi Arabia at this moment . The general assumption , however , is that he is to have talks with King Saud as part of attempts which are apparently being made to sweeten  --  outwardly at any rate  --  relations between Egypt and Syria on the one hand and Saudi Arabia on the other , which have become increasingly embittered since King Saud threw his support behind King Hussein of Jordan in the latter 's firm repression of pro-Egyptian and pro-Syrian factions in Jordan . Developments since the Jordanian crisis have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab governments . Behind this , Egyptian and Syrian propagandists see or profess to see the cunning ! machinations of the United States State Department . There is a parallel belief that Egypt and Syria would not have suffered their recent diplomatic defeats in Jordan if King Saud had not backed King Hussein in the latter 's risky but resolute action . The atmosphere was subsequently acerbated by charges of plots and counterplots exchanged between the Governments of Jordan on the one hand and of Syria and Egypt on the other . Egyptian officials have refrained from direct criticism of King Saud , but there has been more outspokenness in Syria . Last month the Syrian Minister of Delense made a personal attack on King Saud , who indicated his displeasure by withdrawing his ambassador from Damascus . 1Craving for Unity It is one of the paradoxes of the Arabs that although they find it so hard to agree among themselves , they hate in their hearts a deep craving for Arab unity . One of the factors contributing to this yearning is the bond of Islam , the religion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as protector of the Moslem holy places at Mecca and Medina gives hum both a peculiar awareness ot the urge for Arab unity and a uniquely influential role throughout the Arab world . Although in recent months it has been obvious that King Saud is as taking a firm stand against further Communist penetration of the ' Middle East and against radical and revolutionary policies associated particularly with Colonel Nas- ser , many observers noted that he was a &rain/az;  --  notably during his visits to his erstwhile dynastic love in Baghdad and Amman ? tram public onouncements or denunciations likely to widen the breach that was developing with Egypt . Exchange Reported In an interview on the independent British television network earlier this week , the following exchange took place between Colonel Nasser and a reporter  --  according to a text released in Egypt : Question : What about your relations with the Saudi Arabian Kingdom ? Nasser : My personal relations with King Saud are good . But this does not prevent those who want to create trouble from Lying , to create doubts . Question : Does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nasser : The leanings of King Saud must be Arab . Reports from Damascus say King Saud and President Kuwatly of Syria have this week exchanged messages about improving relations between their two countries . It remains to be seen whether General Amer 's visit to Saudi Arabia is part of the same pattern . The Secretary General of the Arab League , Abdel Khalek Hassouna , has just returned to his Cairo headquarters after a visit to King Saud . He said he had firm hope that the Arabs were about to turn a new page in the history of their unity and solidarity . Only events will show whether Mr. Hassouna made this remark in the knowledge that steps were being taken to try to close the widening gap in this unity and solidarity . As for the Egyptian election results , it is difficult to interpret them at this stage . Voters were not being called on to decide any political issues , for all candidates had in effect been approved by the Nasser regime . In results so far announced , there will have to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly large number of electoral districts because no candidate on the list managed to get the necessary over-all majority in the first ballot .
