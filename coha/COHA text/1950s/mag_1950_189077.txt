When Potter Palmer built his house on Chicago 's Lake Shore Drive in 1882 , it had all the appurtenances of a princely European castle except the princes . The redoubtable Mrs. Potter Palmer took care of that . She chartered a yacht , set off for Moscow for the coronation of Czar Nicholas II , and returned triumphantly with a swatch of Russian princelings and princesses to waltz in her velvet-lined ballroom . <P> Potter Palmer was the merchant who brought the bargain sale to Chicago , the real-estate operator who shifted its shopping center from Lake Street to State Street , its residential district from the South Shore to the North ; the hotel man who built the first two Palmer Houses* and , in the second , set a style by paving its barbershop with silver dollars . His wife brought big-time Society to gawky , brash Chicago . <P> The " castle " at 1350 Lake Shore Drive was its center and showpiece and beneath its 80-ft. crenellated towers Bertha Palmer ruled without challenge . The entrance hall rose , tier on carved tier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace was copied from an Italian palazzo , complete to andirons of smoked silver . There was a Louis XVI salon , a Spanish music room , an English dining room , a Moorish room where the rugs were impregnated with rarest perfumes . There were no outside knobs or locks ; anyone wanting to get in ( and many did ) had to ring . <P> Presidents Grant , McKinley and Garfield slept in 1350 's beds , ate off its golden plates . The Duke and Duchess of Veragua came , and the Prince of Wales , who was later to become Edward VII . So did the Infanta Eulalia of Spain , but when she learned that Mrs. Palmer was , after all , an " innkeeper 's wife , " she salved her pride by arriving hours late , and accepting her hostess ' curtsy without a smile . <P> Bertha Palmer died in 1918 . For years , 1350 has been empty , grimily grotesque alongside Lake Shore 's spare apartment buildings . The Millets and Corots were sent to the Art Institute , the furnishings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rooting out the old elms . The house was next : an apartment building would rise in its place . <P> <P> * The first Palmer House burned in 1871 's Great Fire , 13 days after it opened ; the second , completed in 1873 , was replaced in 1927 by the present Palmer House .
