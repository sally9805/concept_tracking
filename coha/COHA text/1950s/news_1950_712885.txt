txt Letters to The Times Government . EWING COCKRELL . New York , May 11 , 1950 . JEROME ALEXANDER . New York ... Letters to The Times To Prevent Atomic War Solutions Heretofore Proposed in U. N , Said to Have Been Nullified To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : This outlines great declarations to prevent atomic war and their present nullification . On Jan. 24 , 1946 , all the United Nations unanimously asked their Atomic Energy Commission to submit proposals that would " insure " the use of atomic energy " only for peaceful purposes . " This was by Assembly resolution previously approved by the three rulers and Prime Minister Mackenzie King of Canada . On Sept. 22 , 1949 , President Truman , speaking of a Soviet atomic explosion , said : " This recent development emphasizes once again * * * the necessity for that truly effective enforceable international control of atomic energy . " On Sept. 21 , 1949 , Secretary of State Acheson said : " The United States is continuing and will continue to strive for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make truly effective the prohibition of atomic weapons . " No United Nations proposed agreement apparently has ever provided a force to keep any state from breaking the whole agreement any time it chose . Every proposal actually provides a general distribution of atomic facilities and allows their use for atomic war , with no state having an " advantage " in the war . Baruch Report The first formal report was made in June , 1946 , by Bernard M. Baruch , chairman of the first United States Commission on Atomic Energy . It called for " enforcement and punishment provisions " of any agreement that would be made to be subject to no veto . Ever since then apparently every report of the U. N. Atomic Energy Commission has approved that declaration , but at the same time made proposals that in effect nullify it . Less than two months after the U. N. Assembly unanimously called for proposals that would insure the prevention of atomic war , the United States State Department published the " Acheson-Lilienthal " Report of Consultants which provides general distribution of atomic plants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not thought that the Atomic Development Authority could protect its plants by military force from the overwhelming power of the nation in Which they are situated . The real protection will lie in the fact that if any nation seizes the plants or stockpiles that are in its territory , other nations will have similar facilities and materials situated in their territories so that the act of seizure will not place them at a disadvantage . " Since then every United Nations Atomic Energy Commission report has contained this same provision . In addition , forty-one United Nations voted in the Assembly for the same " distribution . " The United States representative on the Atomic Energy Commission , Gen. Frederick Osborn , thus emphasizes their plan . It , he says : " * * * does not provide for any armed forces at the disposal of the Atomic Energy Commission to punish violators " ; that " it will neither prevent wars nor prevent the eventual use of atomic weapons , if a total war should develop " ; but that " it would provide such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " advantage " " if war should break out . " Commission Objective The Canadian representative , Gen. A. G. L. , adds his confirmation in the statement that the commission 's objective instead of being for " prevention and punishment of violators " is for " an effective system to insure adequate warnings . " The only United Nations force that is proposed by any delegation is subject to a veto that makes it helpless . Happily there are three great foundations for world peace : ( 1 ) enough atomic energy control to prevent atomic war ; ( 2 ) a strong enough international force to enforce such control ; and ( 3 ) enough national disarmament to make that force adequate . Strong declarations for these three have been made by President Truman and . Prime Ministers Attlee and Stalin . An agreement ( based on men 's successful experience ) to carry them out would contain provision to ( a ) Establish a relatively small international force to be controlled by a commission , each member of which has been approved by the Security Council ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disarmament and atomic energy control and inspections ; ( c ) punish only individual guilty violators , in or out of a Government . EWING COCKRELL . New York , May 11 , 1950 . The Object of Rent Control To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his ex parte plea for landlords , published in THE TIMES of May 5 , John H. Williams claims that " it is economically unsound and morally . wrone to have rent control , for this is " a technique to reduce the income of landlords for the benefit ' of tenants . " This last statement is false , since the only object of rent control is to prevent landlords from charging excessive rents over and above a fair return on their investment , and oppressing tenants because of the housing shortage . While many landlords are honorable and humane , many others are not . How about landlords who insist that the tenant purchase unwanted " furniture " at high prices , something now prohibited by our new state law ? How about landlords who in asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return , " file false or misleading figures , which may go undi7-covered because the " Rent Expediter " could not or would not check them ? In one case a lawyer employed by tenants discovered by an inspection of official city records that the taxable value of the property had been cut to about half of the amount claimed by the landlord in his plea for more rents . With this " correction , " the Rent Expediter announced that the landlord was making more than a fair return , and refused to make the tenants pay higher rents . This happy result did not " reduce the income of landlords , " nor was it " morally wrong . " On the contrary , it gave the landlord all he was justly entitled to , while at the same time protecting the tenants against exactions based on false figures . Was this landlord , or whoever put in the figures for him , " morally right " ? The statement of Prof. Milton Friedman , " The only justification for rent control is either to tax landlords or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to allow landlords a fair return , at the same time protecting tenants from gouging . JEROME ALEXANDER . New York , May 5 , 1950 . Ban on The Nation Restoration of Magazine in School Libraries Is Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : May I make these statements concerning your recent editorial favoring the restoration of The Nation to the libraries of the New York public high schools ? Your statement that Mr. Blanshard 's articles were " critical " of the Catholic Church is misleading . They were not just critical ; they were vilifying . The object of these articles was not to refute Catholic practices ; it was to smear the Catholic Church , and Catholics in general ; it was to hold up the Catholic Church as unworthy of American democracy . This purpose is obvious from the techniques employed by Mr. Blanshard . These techniques are outlined in pamphlets published by the Institute for Propaganda Analysis . For example : Mr. Blanshard refers to the teaching Sisters as " cheap labor " ; to the vow of celibacy taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he misquotes and half-quotes , as in the case cited that a Catholic nurse is forbidden to call a non-Catholic clergyman for a dying non-Catholic patient . That is not " criticism " ; that is crass propaganda . No high school debater would use such techniques because he would be automatically disqualified . Even our standard newspapers make errors , but they are quick to correct them . At no time in the past two years has either Mr. Blanshard or Miss Freda Kirchwey , editor of The Nation , disclaimed this vilification . The very opposite is true . The editorial policy of The Nation still approves the smearing of things Catholic . Why , in a world begging for goodwill and unity , should this hate-mongering , divisive periodical of pseudo-liberalism be placed , at taxpayers ' expense , on the school library shelf for adolescents ? JOHN T. MCSHARRY , Administrator , West Side Adult School . Newark , N. J. , May 8 , 1950 . Free Press Principle To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Times : I wish to commend your editorial wherein you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former place on the schools ' lists in the interests of free speech and fair play . When any church or organization takes a stand on public issues its points of view are open , as Dr. William Jansen phrases it , " to legitimate criticism . " There must be no muzzling of a free press if we are to preserve our democratic institutions . Now , as never before , the implementing of this principle is crucial . ELLIOT FIELD . Windham Center , Conn. , May 3 , 1950 . Use of Hydrants To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It has been trying these past months to hear constantly through the newspapers , radios , etc. , of the water shortage . The Water Commission seems to have " passed the buck " to the people successfully , while not acknowledging any laxity on its part . It seems to me that a shortage has been threatened for some years now . The elements have cooperated with us this winter . Yet there is a summer ahead . As long back as I can remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to run most of the day . It seems to me that now is the time to plan ahead . The Water Commission can not watch all these open hydrants ( I 'm not talking about the parks ) . Why not have the police in their " prowl cars " help ? When they see an open hydrant , with water being wasted , find out why and for what purpose . The police should have the power to close hydrants and to prosecute offenders , if necessary . EDWARD J. BREHAN . New York , May 5 , 1950.
