THE VINTAGE ( 310 pp. ) - Anthony West-Houghton Mifflin ( $3 ) . <P> <P> It certainly looked like a good proposition . Life on beautiful Cape Sable was one long holiday and here it was being handed to him for eternity-swimming and boating , good food and plenty to drink , handsome , leggy girls and no questions asked . But John Wallis turned it down cold ; he ran away from it straight into a private hell of his own choosing . <P> Some time before he made this unusual choice , British Colonel John Wallis had shoved a .45 into his mouth and blown his brains out . As a barrister on the British commission investigating war crimes , he had helped hang German General von Kenelm ; Wallis ' overwhelming sense of guilt had pulled the trigger . So , in British Anthony West 's first novel , The Vintage , Wallis is first seen on a mortuary slab . The rest of the book tells of his guilt-and conscience-plagued pilgrimage through the purgatory of which Cape Sable is a part . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Black Lamb and Grey Falcon , The Meaning of Treason ) , 35-year-old Anthony has thought earnestly and long about the tincture of guilt that has seeped into the stream of consciousness of modern man and created a field day for the psychoanalysts . Like his father , the late great H. G. Wells , * he has a considerable talent for creating the geography of a make-believe world to suit his fictional purpose . <P> In The Vintage , Author West explores two worlds : 1 ) an imagined purgatory which borrows nothing from such Godfearing models as Dante 's Inferno but has much in common with the Godless statism of George Orwell 's 1084 ; 2 ) the real British middle-class world of John Wallis seen through numerous flashbacks . Neither exploration is wholly successful . Wallis ' purgatory , with its concentration-camp pall and forced pleasure-resort atmosphere is skillfully but too obviously contrived . Wallis ' real-life experience , with its high quota of banal woman trouble , comes close to being boring . <P> What becomes more important than either world is West 's exploration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for his conduct . Ironically , Wallis ' assigned partner through purgatory is General von Kenelm , his legal victim . He too reveals his past : that of a ruthlessly ambitious soldier who first murdered his best friend and then whole masses of people . At first , true to his nature , Kenelm is willing to settle for a soft spot on Cape Sable . In the end , like Wallis , he feels the need to exorcise his evil conscience . <P> Wallis ' life turns out to have been not so much a web of calculated evil as of thoughtlessness and stupidity . He was always at odds with his conventional father , almost from the first had too much money . In purgatory , what seems to bother him most is his haphazard sex life and the scars it left on him and on his women . One by one they are brought before him and Wallis realizes that through his earthly life he was incapable of real love , behaved badly with wife and mistresses alike . <P>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
