txt may he censored at the camp fire . Preferably the revery is autonomou masculine and often consists solely of heroic hunting legends and myth@ where men only play the role of heroes . In discussing the function of American sport my colleague distinctly con fined his remarks to the purpose it served himself and other men . We have little knowledge of the feminine player or sporting enthusiast ( in 1950 , 540 of the 10,230 professional athletes were women ) , except that many " feminine players " are " masculine females . " We have even less knowledge of the female spectator , and least knowledge of the spectator of female players . Let us consider the female fan . Her plight is effectively dramatized by an uncertain , confused , and querulous letter addressed by a female fan to a sports columnist who writes in my daily newspaper : I 'm a woman who has loved baseball all of her life . When I was nine or 10 I remember keeping box scores of all the games . My father 's friends were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now that I 'm older , what happens ? Did you ever notice men when women talk baseball to them ? They put on a frozen smile and try to change the subject or get away from you . I still like baseball . But what fun is it for women to take an interest in it when they ca n't discuss it with men who know more about it ? If baseball is slipping , it 's the men who are making it slip . . . by not including women fans in their baseball conversations.16 Age and sex are the fundamental anchorages of personal identity . That both are problematical vis-a-vis their validation in sport and play is underscored in the letter quoted above . Perhaps the female fan , even more than the male hunter or the fisherman , is engaged in a quest for sexuality.17 At least elements of this possibility may be found in the contest between players and spectators that is waged in the wrestling arena . In the case of wrestling it is my impression that I see more females in the background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I view other games and contests . Fortunately I have been able to get some confirmation for this impression from David Riesman , who has found evidence for this in interviews carried on in a recent Kansas City study ( unfortunately for us the interviews were not directly concerned with sport ) . One wonders about the attraction wrestling has for the female spectator . Some who are psychoanalytically oriented might suggest the sadistic qualities of wrestling and consider the vicarious gratification derived from viewing the match . This seems not at all convincing to me . It merely attaches a different name to what is going on , for one thing ; but , for another , boxing is certainly a bloodier sport , although the boxer 's code imposes a suppression of overt manifestation of pain upon the contestants while the wrestler 's code demands that pain , fear , viciousness , and unsportsmanlike conduct be overtly expressed . Yet these expressions are intentionally farcical , and I can not permit myself to believe that our women spectators are enchanted by the farce . This , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsequential . Other observers have noted the sexual representations inherent in various wrestling holds . Guessing that women spectators are middle-aged and , therefore , were introduced to sex in a period before , as Nelson Foote has put it , sex became play , ' " these observers have speculated that the woman spectator of wrestling experiences vicarious gratification from the pain inflicted by one ( male ) wrestler upon the other ( male ) in the sexually suggestive position . This kind of analysis makes somewhat more sense to me than the first , but it presupposes too much about the kind of woman ( age , etc. ) who attends the matches . Let me return to the conception of wrestling as a deliberate and contrived farce . Wrestling is a mockery of the spectator ; and , when many spectators are women , it is women who are mocked . This may partially explain what I would call the " femininization " of wrestling . Although wrestlers appear in many parts on the arena stage ? Indians , Arabian sheiks , atavistic monstrosities , and futuristic supermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . His mere presence in the sports arena is another manifestation of sexual tension along Thurberian lines . Moreover , in his mockery of the demonstrative , vociferous female spectator , the wrestler , has , in fact , become a woman . The female wrestler completes the cycle of the farcical femininization of the sport . Naively we might ask whether the mockery of the female will reintroduce the male to the wrestling audience . Such remarks suggest a final matter that must be considered before we close our discussion of sport and play , namely , the problem posed by the spectacular elements of American sport . Games and Spectacles . To this point we have largely treated various ways in which larger social tensions modify the character of American sport . Now we must turn to possible modifications of sport that are intrinsically generated . We would contend that all sport is affected by the antinomial principles of play and dis-play . These principles , in turn , summarize the contrasting character of games and spectacles , and historically have come to represent basic differences between whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expressed by play and the game , the vainglory of Rome by the spectacles and dis-play of the Caesars . Thucydides observed that the brilliant Spartan commander , Brasidas , was received by the multitudes at Scione with honor befitting an athlete . Moreover , competition for the Olympic crown never threatened the status of the most highborn competitor . In contrast , any Roman patrician appearing in public as a charioteer was stigmatized , and Roman names were conspicuous by their absence from the gladiatorial lists . The difference was , of course , never so dramatically clearcut . Tendencies toward dis-play are to be found in the late history of ancient Greece , and tendencies toward play in the early history of Rome . The illustrations , however , do lay bare the noble character of the game as opposed to the ignoble character of the spectacle . Play and dis-play are precariously balanced in sport , and , once that balance is upset , the whole character of sport in society may be affected . Fur- furthermorc , the spectacular element of sport may , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rules cease to apply , and the " cheat " and the " spoil-sport " replace the players . Yet even here counterforccs are set in motion . If we may , discontinuously , resume our analysis of wrestling , we would note that there is always the " hero " who attempts to defeat the " villain " within the moral framework of the rules of the game . It is a case of law versus outlaw , cops and robbers , the " good guys " versus the " bad guys . " Symbolically the destruction of the game by the spectacle hits called into existence forces of revival which seek to re-establish the rules , but these forces are precisely symbolic ? representative . They are seldom able to destroy the spectacular components of the dis-play . They are part of the spectacle itself . The point may be made in another way . The spectacle is predictable and certain ; the game , unpredictable and uncertain . Thus spectacular dis-play may be reckoned from the outset of the performance . It is announced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gestures . On the other hand , the spectacular play is solely a function of the uncer tainty of the game . The spectacular player makes the " impossible catch " " outdoes himself . " He is out of character . The " villains " and " heroes " of the wrestling stage are in character . Consequently their roles have been predetermined . The denouement of the contest has been decided at its inception , and the " hero " is unlikely to affect the course of events . These things would seem to lie at the base of the American humanist 's aversion to many aspects of contemporary sport and play . The game , inherently moral and ennobling of its players , seems to be giving way to the spectacle , inherently immoral and debasing . With the massification of sport spectators begin to outnumber participants in overwhelming proportions , and the spectator , as the name implies , encourages the spectacular ? the display . In this regard the spectator may be viewed as an agent of destruction as far as the dignity of sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game and the amorality of the spectator ( immoral in its consequences ) . There are many examples of this , but perhaps the most striking is the case of Maurice , " The Rocket , " Richard , spectacular offensive player for the Montreal Canadiens . Fines were of dubious value for bringing " The Rocket " into line following his frequent infractions of the rules ( " immorality " ) , for his fans would inevitably raise funds sufficient to overcompensate for his losses . This action alone tends to break down the morality of the game . However , the ultimate disparity between the immoral demands of the spectator and moral demands of the game was achieved , when , as we know , Montreal experienced its worst riot in recent years in public response to the suspension of " The Rocket " for the remainder of the hockey season . But we can not reverse the tide of history . Massification and the consumption of American sport will be with us yet a while . Perhaps one of the most pressing problems facing the social science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Flay and DIs-Play ( 263 ) ix the problem of how the spectator becomes caught up in the dignity of the game he witnesses to the extent that his consumership of sport is ennobling rather than debasing . Only when that problem is solved and the solution is applied will play become a legitimate ethical alternative to work in America . In Conclusion . I have attempted here to demonstrate how certain tensions in American society ? between production and consumption , work and play , and between the sexes ? and how the tension between play and dis-play contained within sport , itself , cast sport in a uniquely American mold . Now , at the end of the discussion , I wonder to what extent the consequences of these tensions for the character of sport are , in fact , uniquely American . I suspect that few of them are , and that they may be found in most of the nations we bring together in the application of that cumbersome concept , " Western civilization . " All these remarks attest to the lack of ease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure . Our arrangements and stylizations of sport and play do not permit us to look upon the game with the same understanding and sympathy that , let us say , Plato experienced in his view of play and the game : Though human affairs are not worthy of great seriousness it is yet necessary to be serious ; happiness is another thing . . . . I say that a man must be serious with the serious , and not the other way about . God alone is worthy of supreme seriousness , but man is made God 's plaything , and that is the best part of him . Therefore every man and woman should live life accordingly , and play the noblest games , and be of another mind from what they are at present . For they deem war a serious thing , though in war there is neither play nor culture worthy the name , which are the things we deem most serious . Hence all must live in peace as well as they possibly can . What , then , is the right way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain games , making sacrifices , singing and dancing , and then a man will be able to propitiate the gods , and defend himself against his enemies and win in the contest.20 I would doubt that Americans would be the only people today made uneasy by those words . But this in no way restricts the implications of our discussion . A social science of play is needed in America . Without its contributions the ways in which we spend our growing leisure time may never be ennobled . THE BONDS that connect half-a-hundred recreations in America are a credo , which is competition , and a name , which is sports . No other single thread runs through them . Nothing else joins the skier crouching against a winter sky with the catcher squatting in the heat of August . No other tie binds the golden honeymooner pitching horseshoes in the spring at St. Petersburg with the halfback plunging through cold autumn mud at Notre Dame . There is no further link between the Puerto Rican who spars daily in a cramped Manhattan gymnasium and the Ford vice-president who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without the risk of oversimplification , the enveloping rise of sports in the United States during the past thirty years can , I think , be explained rather briefly . A society wholly involved in competition had an increasing quantity of spare time thrust upon it . Was there a more logical mass outlet for the new afternoons and days of American leisure ? Occasionally an orchestra trounces Beethoven and a novelist routs the English language , but compared to Joe Louis trouncing Max Schmeling and the Brooklyn Dodgers routing the New York Giants , these are small , subtle skirmishes . Real competition , the kind that makes a salesman spring for a fourth round of martinis , is duplicated best upon the playing fields . You either make the sale or you lose it . You either hit safely or you make out . The commercial area of sports , with which I am most concerned , goes considerably deeper than that in reflecting society . Big-time sports have underscored the relentless trend toward the big devouring the small . Major league baseball expands while minor league baseball shrinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ televised football game while City College of New York drops football as hopeless and altogether too costly . I do n't intend to offer a history of the growth of sports in America , but it is essential to a knowledge of present conditions to realize that as recently as twenty-five years ago , there was a place for the individual promoter . If he was , say , a boxing man , he had only to provide for the local sports editor each Christmas , issue free tickets to selected political hacks and control his sense of outrage when a fight was fixed before his eyes . Then , if he had a hall , he was in business and eventually he could send his son to Harvard . Today there is no place for the small promoter in boxing or in any other major sport . With the exception of New York and Chicago , there is room for only one team in each major league city . As a result , a franchise is a natural monopoly . All sixteen franchises are controlled by the American League and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only one racetrack can operate profitably in an area at any time . Various state commissions , which cooperate with one another , write the rules that govern racing . As for prizefights , the federal government is now trying to prove that the International Boxing Club controls all championships and stands in restraint of trade . Every important track meet comes more or less directly under the supervision of the Amateur Athletic Union . The National Collegiate Athletic Association oversees all college athletic policy and dictates a TV football code to networks . In an era of bigness and centralization , sports are both big and centrally run . The listing of these commercial sports , plus basketball , hockey , tournament golf and tennis , as a string of monopolies is not in itself an indictment . t ' N ) Through legalisms which I have been unable to grasp , the Supreme ? ruled that boxing is subject to restraint-of-trade laws , which baseball is Legalistics aside , what is repugnant about the monopoly pattern is unvarying adoption of paternalism . In big-time sports , the player has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totalitarian state , even to having commissioner at its head who rules , presumably , by divine right and f whom there is no appeal . Leagues are grouped in one of seven classificati and each division , except the majors , must accept specified salary limits . Directing and preserving this complex structure has become so involved that it requires a body of by-laws ten times longer and considerably more porn ? pous than the U. S. Constitution . From a solely practical standpoint , it is a waste of emotion to pity a professional baseball player . Major league salaries run from the $6,000 paid most rookies to the flat $100,000 Ted Williams earns . The average on a successful team such as the Dodgers runs to slightly better than $18,000 a man for six months ' work . Minor league salaries drop off toward the $121 monthly bottom , but in these prosperous times even the poorest minor league club-owner finds that he must bid in one way or another against aircraft factories and every other industry that advertises " Strong boy wanted for job with good future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , football and hockey repeat the general outline of baseball and in no case are the athletes kept in serfdom . Even in the National Hockey League , where the family of n multi-millionaire named James Norris has a dominant interest in three of the six teams , the average player earns $7,500 . Most athletes seem satisfied with the owners ' largesse , but it is noteworthy that generosity increased all around after major league baseball players banded together and hired a lawyer . The attorney has won some fringe benefits , but the owners retain the trump card . An athlete must accept the team 's final salary offer or not play . A skillful bargainer may win a battle but never a war . Several years ago Carl Furillo , Brooklyn 's monolithic right fielder , so harried Branch Rickey , a suave man who was then directing the club , that Rickey agreed to give him $16,500 of the team 's cash and a prize Angus bull of his own .

Yet there is a profound difference between industry at large and the sports industry in particular . Sports feed directly upon legend . To preserve legend , they must operate behind a curious moral facade . " Well , the company grossed a couple million last year , " is enough of a justification to keep many successful business men from troubling themselves with questions about their presence on earth . With the big sports promoter Money , Muscles ? and myths t co ' there must be more . Victory , sportsmanship and tradition all cloud the profit and loss ledger . Baseball is " The Game " and football is " the natural outgrowth of competitiveness at a time when young men are at their physical prime " and boxing is " the basic , primal conflict . " These catch-phrases guard the legend but in themselves are not enough .

Their drive for self-justification has contributed much to the development of sports . There is an appalling shortage of genuine myth in this country 's background . There are semi-myth figures such as Washington , minor-myth figures such as Paul Bunyan , nonsense-myth figures such as Superman , but there is no Roland , no Arthur , no Siegfried . Obligingly and profitably , sports promoters have thrown their hirelings into the breach . Hollywood offers Ava Gardner as Aphrodite ; sports gives us Babe Ruth for Zeus . The number of adolescent boys who would like to be Mickey Mantle is beyond calculation . Compare it with the number who would like to be Robert Frost . ( I also imagine that the number of teen-age girls who would rather be Ava than Marianne Moore is considerable . ) Fortunately for the promoters , sports have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bust lines sag , chins grow flabby and last spring 's Aphrodite becomes this winter 's Helen Hokinson girl . Sports heroes are less susceptible to time . Steve Ketchel was a fine boxer thirty years ago , but as a myth image he has taken on more depth and beauty in death than he ever possessed in life . It was Ketchel 's posthumous luck to become the motivator of a Hemingway short story in which one character says : " I never saw a man as clean and as white and as beautiful as Steve Ketchel . There never was a man like that . He moved just like a tiger and he was the finest free-est spender that ever lived , Steve Ketchel , and his own father shot him down like a dog .

" With this sort of thing constantly bobbing up , and with a public eager for godheads , suitable for self-identification , sports people long ago learned to believe that , cash aside , their field was a thing apart . " I can remember a brutally hot afternoon last summer , " Ford Frick , the commissioner of baseball , starts one story , " when I was walking near a post office in Manhattan . I noticed three letter carriers struggling under ( 2d$ ) Roger heavy loads , but all the while smiling and chatting . As 1 neared them , realized that they were discussing Willie Mays and the New York ( ruin Baseball had done that .

The sweep of legend and the impact of combed. tiveness have been such that virtually every American over the age of two , thinks , talks , watches , plays or competitively resists sports . But the feeling of essential shallowness can never be erased , a fact dramatically illustrated several years ago in Cincinnati . Heywood Hale Broua , son of the late newspaper columnist , was then a sportswriter assigned to cover the Brooklyn Dodgers . It was a June day , fresh with spring and bur . dened with a long double-header . " What am I doing in Cincinnati , " Broun said aloud in the press box , " watching a ball game on a day like this when I ought to be home walking with my wife and kids . " Broun silently closed his typewriter , caught the next train for New York and has since become an actor . Big-time sports , on television or off , are unimportant as Woody Broun knew but , in mid-century America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the times . HOBBIES , in a few words , are not what they used to be . Originally the name itself derived from hobby-horse , with all its foolish connotations , as though to have a hobby were to pursue a private passion with the frivolous concentration of a child riding a toy animal . Out of a more recent past the term comes to us clothed in associations from a rigorous , Calvinist ethic which held that even relaxation must be energetic . An active hobby , in the imagery of the old school , stood for a secure , though vigorous , tranquility of spirit : viz. Franklin Roosevelt poring over his stamps , or Winston Churchill building brick walls and painting pictures . Yet such security as theirs in time and confidence comes mainly to the very young or very old , so that at a lesser level the most durable symbol for hobbies has surely been an ancient mariner in whiskers , showing a small boy how to put ships in bottles . In the orderly , competitive context of the Protestant nineteenth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobby was the logical device to make time-killing both pointless and productive . It had to be pointless or it would be indistinguishable from work ; it had to be productive or it would be bad for one 's character . Hence the truly outrageous hobbies which represented revolt against that world in terms the world could understand ? like building a model of Chartres cathedral out of toothpicks ; or assembling the world 's most complete collection of streetcar transfers ; or writing the history , geography , economics , and literature of a wholly imaginary continent . Hence also ? for individuals who were not , like a Roosevelt or Churchill , born to leisure with an abundance of energy ? the assumption that hobbies could be defined as unnecessary or irrelevant , or by their quality of arts-and-craftsy make-work . Tying your own trout ffies was a hobby , but fishing was not . Similarly , for a youngster an electric train was an educational toy ; for a grown-up to own one was either a hobby or a sign of senility . Hobbies were to be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most ideas of play derive from childhood , as normally the only period when play is a full-time activity ? their childish character had become forbiddingly stylized . A hobby was instructive , or it developed manual skill , or it followed the pattern of collecting and classifying that had been a respectable basis for scientific discovery in the previous hundred years . The prototype of the hobbyist was the grimy schoolboy who brought snakes and beetles to class in his pockets , or filled his home with the smell of evil brews from a chemistry set , or daubed banana oil on spindly model airplanes . These were respectable pursuits for a child , but when he grew up he would be expected to be a great naturalist , or discover chlorophyll , or design jet engines ? and reconstruct his habits of play accordingly . Even the motto , " Happy the man whose work is his hobby , " assumed that the fully-engaged adult could tell one from the other . But since those simple days a lot has happened . Recently I asked Nathan Polk , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hobby materials of its kind in the world ? what were the current trends in his business , and his immediate reply was that he did n't know exactly what his business was . " Is golf a hobby , " he said , " is reading a hobby ? The whole thing 's intangible . " Mr. Polk went on to explain the rule-of-thumb methods by which he decides whether or not a given hobby falls within his jurisdiction , but in so doing he found it necessary to mention the background of spare-time manners and customs which condition his choice . It is a remarkably different one from the social situation in which hobbies originated , and it compels Mr. Polk to be highly selective . Wherever there used to be hard-and-fast 1 /11 ) 6/R SARI lines between hobbies and mundane , utilitarian affairs there are now wilt new categories of activity that are partly hobbies and partly not- for instanter eating . Formerly the consumption of food would have been called a necessary or the opposite of a hobby , but it is no longer treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended on their kitchens by women w had few other outlets for their sense of competence and creativeness , hut in that such efforts are unnecessary there are housewives who replace the , ; with a playful , corner-cutting enterprise . The straightforward , no-nonsense , meat-and-potatoes American diet has been snowed under in an avalanche of cookbooks filled with exotic recipes ? German , Chinese , Jewish , Drench , Italian , Barbecue , Casserole , Wine Lover 's , or Ulcer Diet ? and sophistic*. tion is so far out of hand that a margarine company has thought it wise to take an ad in a supermarket magazine to describe the making of garlic bread . ( You might say that for many not eating has become a hobby , with the con. sequent deluge of calorie-reduced flour , calorie-reduced soft drinks , caloricreduced chocolate cookies , and even calorie-reduced beer . ) This is n't just woman 's work , either . The man who wants to make life comparably difficult for himself has only to go to a sporting-goods store ( sic ! ) and buy what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packaged unit of mortar , ironwork , and instructions ? wherewith to fill his weekends with the ritual of preparing elaborate hamburgers and basking in the formalized ridicule of his guests . Many hobbies , on the other hand , have lost their time-killing status and turned deadly earnest . The home workshop is now far less likely to be a source of inlaid cigarette boxes and rustic cuckoo clocks than of substantial items of family furniture . Young-married couples who may have learned to do cabinet work as a hobby would far rather do it for themselves than pay for it , at present prices , especially now that equipment and supplies have been made easier to get and to use . After they have acquired the appropriate power tools , an extraordinary number go on to build all or part of their own houses ? which is making your home your hobby with a vengeance . This large-scale return to the tinkering tradition has created a new industry to service it ? with the ungainly name of " Do-It-Yourself " ? and has caused the merchandisers of building materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n Brooklyn , this fall , five free lectures on home-furnishing materials and techniques are being offered by the Paint and Wallpaper Dealers Association . In California , which always goes the rest of the Union one better , the Pan Pacific Do-It-Yourself Show exhibited separate pieces of fur that can be assembled into a do-it-yourself mink coat . Once the hobbyist was presumed to be an amateur , in the best and worst senses of the word . Now you seldom know when a hobby stops being for fun and becomes professional . Even the schoolchildren who make hobbies of science have succeeded remarkably well in keeping up with it , and this during a decade in which science has progressively lifted itself above the common reach into lavishly equipped laboratories . The teen-agers can now build Wilson ( ' loud Chambers , to see cosmic rays for themselves as only graduate students at universities could before . One New Jersey boy had his family television set prepared for color almost as soon as the broadcasting companies announced it , and a Long Island girl repeated in her family washtub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial rain-making . Probably the prize in this department goes again to California , where a group of five high-school physics students in El Cerrito made a cyclotron . Worked , too . Strangely enough , as new-style hobbies have arisen , the old seem not to have declined . Some of them , quite to the contrary , have become big-time . Those little balsa-wood and rice-paper contraptions , which used to fly on the power of a wound-up rubber band , today have developed into gasolinedriven craft of silk-covered aluminum ; the newest have jet engines , fly under radio control at 160 miles per hour , and cost as much as $20,000 apiece . When the 21st annual National Model Airplane Meet was held last year ( in , of course , California ) there were a mere thousand enthusiasts present , but they were drawn from a total for the whole country ? not counting the millions who still stick to the old-fashioned wind-by-hand models ? of 500,000 identifiable fanatics . The business of supplying them with model planes and parts has multiplied by five or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates of its national volume were reported by the Wall Street Journal to fall between $10 and $30 million a year . As with model airplanes , so elsewhere . " Never before at any time , " said Mr. Polk , " have so many people bought , either to construct or shape , so many hobby materials . " New hobbies , in some cases , seem to revivify old ones ( just as photography , for instance , has been revived by color film , stereo-cameras , and inexpensive flash equipment ) . Mr. Polk defines his areas of interest as " spare-time activities serving the whole family , " but starting with children in ( a ) educational and manipulative toys , through ( b ) the model building stage to the point of ( c ) entering and bordering fully on the arts and crafts ( Polk 's Hobbies has three major fields , though they are subordinate to the second category , in model railroads , ship models , and toy soldiers or scale military models ) . Yet , in spite of phenomenal growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past few years the greatest development has been in the arts and crafts ? by the numbers . " By this cryptic phrase , said Mr. Polk , he meant the ready-to-paint sets of artists ' materials in which the canvas not only has a picture sketched on it but a number in each area corresponding to the color to be put there . The raw simplicity of this gimmick seems to have appealed to thousands upon thousands who had wanted to be Sunday painters , as President Eisenhower is , but had never dared to try . From easel painting the technique spread to " American traditional " black metal trays , to wastebaskets , and eventually to needlepoint . " For a small investment , " said Mr. Polk , " you get a useful object in the house . " He had asked his salesmen to estimate how many customers graduated from the numbered system , even after ten or twenty tries , to painting on their own with colors and subjects of their individual ch the answer was about 10 per cent ?

" What seems to be going on here is a major readjustment innate leisure habits , a change so pervasive that nothing can stand in its wa including television .

We figure t we 're now losing only an hour a day of the time of TV owners , instead the five or six we were losing when it first came into the area . " The pre state of hobbies , if nothing else , should refute the prophets of spectators the disease which was going to reduce the mass-media audience to an ins cility of non-participation . " People are turning more to personal aetivi sports , " said the sales manager of a sporting-goods company early this yea " away from the big spectator games . " " Five years of television , " says an official of one of the country 's largest merchandisers of musical equipment , " have done more for our business than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom as big as the present one , everything booms . My impression is that numbers of the older generation 's hobbies have declined , in the sense that most people I know have given up model-building , collecting butterflies , or carving soap , in favor of assembling high-fidelity radio-phonographs , building bookcases , painting their own apartments , reading up on the history of the Civil War , or writing articles like this one . Yet , at the same time , I 'm reasonably certain there are so many new family units in the United States ( half as many bachelors as fifty years ago ) , so many more hours of spare time available ( six times as many people getting three-week vacations as in 1946 ) , and so much more money to spend on non-essentials , that any specific loss is more than accounted for in the general gain . It works the other way , too . The lush prosperity of the model aircraft business may not mean that enthusiasm for model aircraft is proportionately greater than it used to be , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospering . The awe-inspiring spectacle that the figures reflect is the birth of a new leisure class , not a minority that gives all its time to play but a majority that gives play part of its time . In the Western world this phenomenon is unprecedented ( less so , perhaps , in the less work-minded and conscience-ridden areas of Africa and the Orient ) , and its delivery has been attended by confusion . So sharply divergent are the views of renascence and decay in American culture that , even if we knew to the last detail what had happened to hobbies in the past few years , we would not know what to make of it . With the astonishing increase in free time ? that is , time that has been " paid for " by work , rather than merely unemployed time ? has come a mushrooming demand for leisure services of every kind : highbrow along with vulgar , hobbies plus amusements undreamed-of as such , the traditional recreations plus a host of new ones . Everywhere the statistics are equally overwhelming and impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street Journal , whose reporting of popular culture is the most informative to be found , and Itself an index of the importance that leisure has come to occupy in the national economy .

Item : The amount spent in Florida on deep-sea fishing is greater than the combined grosses of the state 's citrus and cattle industries . Item : Though the number of golf courses has declined from 5,500 to 4,970 ( as real estate was needed for new houses ) , the number of golfers has increased 25 per cent in the past ten years .

Item : Michigan last year licensed 61,000 people to hunt with the bow and arrow . And so it goes . What is one to conclude from these exuberant manifestations ? First of all , I think , that the hobbyist as such is an archaic figure . He was the product of a world which tried to separate existence into semantically air-tight categories , where work was serious and play was not , but both tended to be workful . Now we are more prone to hope that work and play may intermingle , and both be playful . As a nation , we are saturating ourselves in leisure so indiscriminately that we need no longer pretend we know one form of it to be better for our psyches than another . Any distraction may be more of a hobby than it looks , and all hobbies may not be the bagatelles they seem . It may still be true that " every man needs a hobby , " to the extent that everyone needs more than one skill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he earns a living , and needs skill even in effecting that escape . But it is not true to the extent that true leisure and true work , as far as they aid the individual to realize himself , can never be fully separated . " Happy the society , " perhaps , " whose members can no longer tell their hobbies apart . " Apparently hobbies are still favorably situated in the American hierarchy of values . The ability to do-for-oneself is still admired , the devotion of the individualist to his pet enthusiasm is still respected , and the inventive potentialities of the amateur are still recognized as valid . But the use of leisure time is a growing national preoccupation , and the vocabularies of behavior which the hobbyist once had to himself are now widely understood . Hobbies , in losing their exclusiveness , can achieve their justification . If all the devices of spare-time self-amusement require competence and practice , just as hobbies do , then the word can be abandoned at the same time that the incentives in which it originated are accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hobby , playing croquet is a hobby , belonging to organizations is a hobby , &I"; listening to phonograph records is a hobby , betting on the horses is n h or staring out the window on a sunny day is a hobby , then the arts civilized living are the greatest hobbies of them all . With one caveat : only those may disown the hobby approach who ha learned from it the omnivorous interest , the constant curiosity , the e replenished wonder before the new-born day that made one American t greatest hobbyist of history . " There is not a spring of grass that shoots , wrote Thomas Jefferson to his daughter , " uninteresting to me . " The Do-It-Yourself Market Prepared by U. S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE INCREASED earnings and more leisure hours have provided millions of Americans with both the income and the time for many new interests and activities . One of the most important of these new interests is the Do I t Yourself trend which includes home carpentry , painting and decorating , gardening , and other activities in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall measurement of the size and scope of the Do-It-Yourself market has been made , either by Government or by private industry . However , many separate estimates of current and potential sales of particular categories of merchandise have been made by research organizations , industries , trade associations , and trade and consumer publications . The information on estimated sales volume and other statistical data is necessarily based on such estimates . It is not offered as official Government data but as the best available information from several private industry sources indicating characteristics of the Do-It-Yourself market . Reasons for the Growth of the Do-It-Yourself Market . Do-It-Yourself activities have received impetus ? in addition to the stimulus of higher incomes and more leisure time ? from several factors , such as : 1 . Today more than 55 percent of all homes are owner-occupied . This figure was 44 percent in 1940 . Owner 's pride of possession makes him spend more time and money on his home . 2 . The " flight to the suburbs " ? the substantial shifts in population in recent years to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trend to outdoor living and a demand for the tools and products used outdoors . 3 . Home owners in this new " Suburbia " are typically younger couples , with larger than normal families and with earnings in the middle Income brackets . 4 . Home ownership by these younger couples , who are enthusiastic advocates of Do-It-Yourself , has been encouraged and made more feasible by the prevailing more liberal extension of credit through mortgage insurance by the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans ' Administration . 5 . The Do-It-Yourself market for these new homeowners is greatly stimulated because a great many of their homes were built on an expandable basis ? an attic to be finished , a garage , carport or breezeway to be added , or a basement to be finished as a recreation room . When older homes are bought , these new younger homeowners undertake many similar renovation projects on the Do-It-Yourself basis . 6 . The Do-It-Yourself trend has been greatly stimulated by the fact that skilled labor is hard to get and costs more than ever before . 7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armed Forces and women in war plants became familiar with the use of tools . The younger generation has learned much about woodworking and metalworking in school . The Do-It-Yourself way of improving and beautifying the home , both inside and out , the search for new recreation outlets in the hobby fields , the increased activities in home dressmaking ? all are a part of the new way of life . It has affected the sale of many products ranging from paint to power lawn mowers . The information in this Bulletin has been compiled to provide retailers with a better appreciation of the importance of this Do-It-Yourself market , currently estimated at $6 billion a year , and to indicate successful methods of realizing potential sales . Do-It-Yourself activities can be broadly grouped as follows : 1 . Structural home improvements 2 . Home decoration ( painting , wallpapering ) 3 . Home furnishing ( furniture making and finishing , slip covering ) 4 . Gardening and grounds maintenance 5 . Home dressmaking and sewing 6 . Hobbies ( model building , cabinetmaking ) The Home Workshop . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of World War II . It has been estimated that 11 million homes in America now have workshops . Manufacturers have redesigned their products for easier use by the home workman and provide plans , drawings , and guides for a wide variety of products . Plans and materials in kit form can be bought for boats , houses , airplanes , automobiles , and tractors . The rental of tools has become big business . One Cincinnati dealer reported billings in 1953 of $28,000 in tool rentals . Many stores are also building a profitable business in the rental of waxers , polishers , and sanders . ( Much of the following information on power tools is based on the results of a survey of the industry made by Arthur D. Little , Inc. , an industrial engineering firm of Cambridge , Massachusetts. ) 1 . The multipurpose bench tool has had a most dramatic increase . a sales volume of approximately $2,250,000 in 1948 , the first signs year , to about $24,000,000 in 1953 . This tool drives four or five mac from a single power plant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work shops ) but also saves the costs of additional motor and starter switches . Often the motor and starter switch price practic equals the machine price . One motor driving four machines , a drill , se lathe , and sander , would eliminate the purchase of three motors , a saving . possibly $100 . The multipurpose tool should be sold on the basis of the buyer 's indh vidual need . The machine which will be used most should be the basis t4 this tool with all other units as components . 2 . Single-purpose bench tools ? arbor saws , drill presses , band saws , jig saws , jointers , sanders , grinders , shapers , and lathes ? increased from about $15,000,000 sales volume in 1946 to about $40,000,000 in 1953. 3 . Portable electric tools ? drills , saws , sanders , polishers , routers , and grinders ? have zoomed from around $6,000,000 sales volume in 1946 to about $95,000,000 in 1953 . BENCH HOME-TYPE TOOLS . The following table indicates the current relative importance of the various types of bench tools : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blades , bits , drills , etc. ? make up about 10 percent of total dollar sales . About 60 percent of the . bench home-type tool production moves through wholesalers and 40 percent directly to chains and large retailers . Of the amount handled by wholesalers about 85 percent is sold to hardware retailers and 15 percent to miscellaneous outlets . PORTABLE HOME-TYPE TOOLS . The following table indicates the current relative importance of the various types of portable electric tools : figure Sales of accessories ? blades , bits , drills , sanding attachments , etc. ? are approximately 10 percent of the total dollar volume . About 50 percent of the portable home-type power tools produced are sold through wholesalers and about 40 percent are sold directly to chuins . The remaining 10 percent moves to retailers ( other than chains ) either directly or through manufacturers ' agents . Of the amount handled by wholesalers about 70 percent is sold to hardware retailers and 30 percent to miscellaneous outlets . SEASONAL PATTERNS . In terms of 100 percent representing the monthly average , the following table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools . figure Hand tools are , of course , essential equipment for a home workshop . A well-equipped workshop might represent an investment of several hundred dollars in hand tools of all kinds ? screw drivers , saws , hammers , chisels , wrenches , drills , pliers , and files . A wide variety of materials are worked on in the home workshop . Industry estimates that 350 million square feet of fir plywood , representing 10 percent of the industry 's production , were used in Do-It-Yourself activities in 1953 , an increase of 160 percent since 1946 . Average annual sales per us U. S. household of lumber and building materials for Do-ItYourself activities are estimated at over $60 . The plywood industry , through trade associations , has been particularly active in the Do-It-Yourself field . A wide selection of dealer selling aids is made available , including a 3-D viewer to help customers visualize things they can make with plywood and a handy panel rack which displays for selfselection the small sized panels for workshop use . Plans for making hundreds of products from plywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aluminum has been specially engineered for use with standard woodworking hand or power tools . Available in sheets , rods , tubes , bars , and strips , it can be worked just like wood ? sawed , drilled , planed , and jointed ? for a great variety of products ranging from wheelbarrows to wastebaskets . A self-selection display stand is available from one manufacturer . Although introduced only last year , annual sales of this Do-It-Yourself aluminum already amount to several million dollars . Amateur furniture makers are enthusiastic about foam rubber , now available by the yard and in shapes for chair seats , pillows , and back rests . New products and adaptations of old products are constantly being introduced for the home workman trade ; to mention only a few ? plastic upholstery material that can be cut and sewed like fabric , plastic laminates for counter tops , plastic screening and fiberglass panels for partitions . Painting and Decorating . Industry estimates that the home workman will buy 150 million gallons of paint this year , 75 percent of the industry 's proIry / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consumer analysis surveys by newspaper* six cities showed an average by cities of 8() percent of inside : Ind 60 per of outside household paint jobs were done by " Do-lt-Yoursclfeis . " Manufacturers have stimulated this market by introducing new products such the fast-drying latex-base paint and new easy-to-use tools such as rollers , compressed-air spray guns for home use , and paint in pressure e for small jobs . Estimates in the trade are that yearly sales of the paint roller will re 8 million units this year ? some $24 million worth at retail . The wallpaper industry has also introduced new easy-to-apply produces such as pre-trimmed and packaged paper , washable plastic-coated paper , and paper with adhesive already applied to the back . Sales in 1954 to the Do-It-Yourself trade are estimated at 150 million rolls , about 60 pc cent of the industry 's production as compared with 28 percent 10 years ago , according to an estimate by American Home magazine . Customer preferences by type of paper are estimated by Wallpaper Makiazine as follows : figure New floor and wall tiles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastics have been introduced , and sales to the amateur ran about $116 million last year . Sales of asphalt tiles for the Do-It-Yourself market are estimated thin year at 500 million square feet , roughly one-half of the industry 's production , according to industry estimates . Gardening and Grounds Maintenance . The " flight to the suburbs " with its companion trend to outdoor living has caused a boom in gardening supplies and equipment of all kinds with 1953 sales totalling almost $700 mil lion , up $200 million since 1947 . An estimated 18 million home owners now do their own landscaping . According to Business Week , power lawn mower sales are currently at a yearly rate of over $100 million which is 20 times the 1940 rate . Hedge trimmers , power cultivators , chain saws , and garden tractors have enjoyed excellent sales . Garden implements have been introduced in special sizes and with special handles for female gardeners . Home Dressmaking and Sewing . The piece goods business in 1953 amounted to an estimated $400 million plus approximately $100 million in sewing notions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume in paper patterns was $40 million ? about 85 million patterns , twice the rate in prewar years . Some 1.8 million sewing machines were sold for domestic use in 1953 , swelling the total in use in the United States to about 32 million . A survey by the New York University School of Retailing of the customers of a New York department store indicated that over 40 percent had made their own draperies . Sources of Information . A number of consumer magazines devote substantial sections of each issue ( in some instances , practically the whole issue ) to articles of the " how-to-do-it " or " how-to-make-it " type . Many of these articles are of interest to the retail merchant as they are good sources of promotional ideas and indicate the materials and products for which demand may be stimulated .

CREECH , it is said , wrote on the margin of the Lucretius which he was translating , " Mem. ? When I have finished my book , I must kill myself , " and he carried out his resolution . This story , true or false , is reported by Voltaire as characteristic of English manners , and represents a current French theory as to our national tastes . Life in England , if we may venture to draw the moral of the anecdote , is a dreary vista of monotonous toil , at the end of which there is nothing but death , natural , if it so happen , but if not , voluntary , without even a preliminary interval of idleness . To live without work is not supposed to enter into our conceptions . We are nothing but machines employed to execute a particular duty ; and when that duty is done , we think it better to break up the machine than to allow it to rust into gradual decay . In this opinion we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice , or rather nothing but a particular case of that utter want of appreciation with which rival nations regard each other . Each people can understand the more serious occupations of its neighbour , but finds it hard to enter into its amusements . Everybody wants to eat and drink and sleep , but everyone has his own peculiar notion of pleasure . Seeing the spare time of foreigners employed on purposes for which we care little , we fancy that they must be intolerably bored . A sporting man imagines that life must be unendurable in a country where there are no horse-races , no prize-fights , and no Bell 's Life to chronicle the glories of the turf or the cricket-ground . Yet , unreasonable as all such prejudices are said to be , we can sympathise to some extent with the feelings of the Frenchman in England . We can guess at the horror which overwhelms him if he has arrived on a Saturday night , and turns out for a Sunday walk along the streets of London . Imagining , as he would naturally Reprinted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 1869 ) , pp. 205-214. that he is witnessing our mode of employing a day set apart for relaxation , he would shudder on picturing to himself the more serious moments of a nation whose pleasure so strongly resembles the settled gloom of other races . On holidays , we are just capable , it would seem , of creeping along our streets in funereal processions , and relieving our woes by draughts of gin and " porter-beer . " How is his imagination to paint the horrors of our working days ? and is it strange if suicide seems to him to be the most fitting termination of such melancholy lives ? Let us suppose , however , that our friend recovers from this shock to his nerves , and penetrates the rough outside of English life . Will that domestic hearth , whose pleasures we are accustomed to celebrate , strike him as compensating by its glowing warmth for the chill fog without ? If , for example , he is fortunate enough to receive an invitation to one of those cheerful entertainments called evening parties , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exhilaration ? The theory on which they are constructed seems to imply the existence of an amazing faculty for amusement . We apparently consider it sufficient to cram into a room twice as many people as it will comfortably hold , to make them all happy . We love each other so much that we ca n't pack too tight . By squeezing a number of apples into a press we can produce cider ; and it is apparently believed that in a sufficiently crowded mass of humanity , raised to the proper temperature , there takes place a kind of social fermentation , possessing a certain spiritually intoxicating influence . There is so much brotherly love , I suppose , permeating our constitutions , that it only requires pressure to bring it out . And therefore it may be from some peculiar moral perversion that in my case , and some others which I know , the fermentation somehow takes place the wrong way ; it all turns sour ; and besides detesting the gentleman who stands on my toes , and the other one whose bony framework is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misanthropy on such occasions , and receive awful revelations of the depths of human folly . That some persons are happy is perhaps probable ; flirtations , for example , may take place at evening parties , as they certainly do in shipwrecks , in hospitals , in the interior of omnibuses , and other scenes of almost universal misery : but when I look round , with the conventional compromise between a scowl and a simper , I fancy that I catch many answering symptoms of disgust on the faces of fellow-sufferers . The true final cause of evening parties , it may be urged , is not pleasure , but business ; they are frequented , as the Stock Exchange is frequented , with a view to ulterior profit , rather than with any expectation of immediate returns in the shape of amusement . They are the markets at which we extend our social connections ; and , perhaps , if Mr. Mill be right , do a little in the way of slave-dealing . That people should hypocritically continue to express pleasure in attending them , if melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social grievances . We could not get on without a little lying ; and , so long as music is not added to the other torments provided , I am ready to bear my part of the suffering with such stolid indifference as I can command . We may suppose , however , that our foreigner is ready to extend his researches a little further . If he believes as implicitly as a man ought to believe in the thorough trustworthiness of the British press , he will learn that the Derby is the true national holiday . Its pleasures are so great that even our legislators relax in its favour their habitual regard to the duties of their station . It illustrates all our best qualities ; our manly spirit of play , our power of self-government , our wonderful facility for keeping order without the presence of the military , our genuine politeness and felicitous combination of boisterous good-humour with freedom from anything like horseplay , and so on . And yet , I think , a sensible man will mentally ask himself , on his return , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? That some answer must be found follows from the well-attested though melancholy fact that many persons have been to see the Derby twice ; but what that answer is , I have never been able to discover . I do not speak of gamblers or professional persons ; their motive is plain enough ; though it may be observed , by the way , that nothing is so strong a proof of utter mental vacuity as a love of gambling ; it is the pursuit of excitement pure and simple by a man who is capable of no nobler interest , and accordingly it is found to exist most strongly in savages , who , having nothing to do , will play for their scalps , and in those classes which most nearly approach the savage type in modern society and are forced to find a field for energies running to waste in fieldsports , betting , and other such barbarous amusements . We can , however , dimly understand why a man should frequent a place where he is winning or losing thousands of pounds . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Epsom Downs have no serious pecuniary interest , that they only know a horse as a four-legged animal generally forming part of a cab , and consequently that the mere sight of twenty such animals galloping for two or three minutes is not very exhilarating . Yet for this , at any rate , ostensible reason , they undergo a day of pushing and squeezing in railways and carriages , they are assailed by all manner of predatory humans , they stand for hours in rain , wind , and dust , and a large minority find their only intelligible pleasure in getting drunk . That , however , they might do at home ; and it is not the motive of ladies or of many other persons who expose themselves to the inflictions of the day . I can understand the pleasure of a prize-fight or a bull-fight ; I can believe that a gladiatorial show , when you had suppressed all humane feeling , must have been one of the most absorbing , if one of the most horrible , of amusements . I can even appreciate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a man hanged , or still more of seeing martyrs burnt . In all these there is a real spectacle of human suffering , and when they are properly managed , of human heroism , which may properly affect our sympathies . Athletic sports of all kinds are worth seeing , when we understand anything about them , as they possess something of the same interest without the counterbalancing horrors ; but to see horses pass you like a flash of lightning gives to the mass of the crowd no pleasure that would not come equally from witnessing the throwing of dice or the drawing of a lottery . It Is merely n question of whether it a blue jacket is first at a certain post . And , to he short , in accordance the celebrated precedent of Artemus Ward , I treat the inquiry into the ca of this strange pleasure as a conundrum and give it up . One conclusion , however , may be drawn , which is tolerably evident f other considerations . When a student is learning to paint , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really sees . When he sits do before a landscape , it is twenty to one that he will try to represent , not the image of which he is supposed to be immediately conscious , but something which other people have persuaded him that he ought to see and must see , He does not copy the direct impression on his senses , but some imaginary object , which , without knowing it , he has constructed partly from observation and partly from a long series of traditions and inferences and arbitrary associations . In the same way , one of the most difficult of things is to know what we really enjoy . We do something which we have been always taught to consider as a convivial proceeding , and fancy that we are in a high state of enjoyment . Nothing is easier in practice , though in theory nothing should be more difficult , than to deceive people about their own emotions , and to cheat them into a belief of their own happiness . This is the difficulty which lies at the bottom of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage to unravel the complex web of associations which conceals us from ourselves , we go on stupidly suffering , in the sincere conviction that sixty minutes of weariness and vexation of spirits make up an hour of happiness . Many thousands of persons at the present moment are enjoying , or pretending to themselves that they are enjoying , a holiday . They will come back almost tired to death of their pleasures , and delighting to return to their business , and yet they will persuade themselves and others that they have passed an inconceivably agreeable vacation . To convince oneself of their mistake , it is enough to watch the British tourist at his so-called amusement . Of all the dreary places in this world , none , perhaps , is more depressing to a philanthropic mind than the ordinary English watering-place . That the lodging-house is a torment has become notorious . A workhouse or a gaol is bad enough ; but their inmates are scarcely in more melancholy quarters than those gloomy rooms , at once bare and frowzy , with a large shell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lord-lieutenant of the county on the walls , a slatternly landlady downstairs , and a select party of parasitical insects in the bedrooms , in which the English paterfamilias consumes uneatable food , and tries to recall London to his imagination by reading the Daily Telegraph , from its glowing leaders to its interesting advertisements . Mariana found the moated grange bad enough ; but she was not tormented , so far as we know , with barrel-organs . Sailors confined through the winter to their ships in the Arctic seas are generally pitied ; but they have a greater variety of amusements than the visitor of some miniature of London super mare . An ocean steamer appears to its passengers for the time as about the culminating point of human weariness ; yet even there , if there is more sea-sickness , there is also more society and more excitement in the incidents of the voyage . A grown-up man can not make mud-pies , or build castles in the sand with wooden spades , and he is not , as a rule , passionately devoted to donkey-riding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover , either from personal observation or from a careful perusal of the pages of contemporary novels and newspapers , these seem to be the main amusements provided for an intellectual public . It is true that some persons are brutal enough to amuse themselves by shooting gulls , in the spirit , I suppose , of the lady who , in one of Mr. Browning 's poems , smashes a beetle , because , being wretched herself , she dislikes witnessing the enjoyment of other living beings . I rejoice that their cruelty is to be checked ; but one can not but ask oneself , what then are they to do ? Following the Briton abroad , we find him scarcely the better off for powers of enjoyment . Let any intelligent persons strike into the tracks of a party of Mr. Cook 's tourists and study their modes of passing the time . Watch them in picture-galleries , at churches , or in celebrated scenery , and try to determine whether their enjoyment be genuine , or a mere conventional parade . Two or three painfully notorious facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no independent judgment ; he admires what the infallible Murray orders him to admire ; or , in other words , he does not admire at all . The tourist never diverges one hair 's breadth from the beaten track of his predecessors , and within a few miles of the best known routes in Europe leaves nooks and corners as unsophisticated as they were fifty years ago ; which proves that he has not sufficient interest in his route to exert his own freedom of will . The tourist , again , is intensely gregarious ; he shrinks from foreigners even in their own land , and likes to have a conversation with his fellows about cotton-prints or the rate of discount in the shadow of Mont Blanc : that is , when he imagines himself to be taking his pleasures abroad , his real delight consists in returning in imagination to his native shop . The tourist , in short , is notoriously a person who follows blindly a certain hackneyed round ; who never stops long enough before a picture or a view to admire it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every opportunity of transplanting little bits of London to the districts which he visits . Though all this has been said a thousand times , the same thing is done more systematically every year , until one is inclined to reverse the old aphorism , and declare that every man is a hypocrite in his pleasures . We are supposed to travel mainly in search of the beautiful and the picturesque ; and yet the faculty which takes pleasure in such things is frequently in a state of almost complete atrophy . Writers of poetry and florid prose have now for many years been singing the praises of lovely scenery , and it is considered disgraceful to be unmoved by mountains , lakes , and forests : but I suspect that four people out of five share Dr. Johnson 's preference of the view at Charing Cross to the most charming of rural landscapes . Why , indeed , should it be otherwise ? At Charing Cross there is something which we can all understand ; there is that peculiar manufactory in which Mr. Matthew Arnold delights ; there are omnibuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shopwindows , and newspaper placards ; and every one of those objects has a certain interest for the intelligent cockney . There is a long successful little dramas , which appeal in one way or another to his sympathies , a gratuitous exhibition of all the articles which are supposed to be suitable for his wants . Why should he go to look at a variety of green objects w names and uses are a mystery to him , or to stare at a big cliff with a m of ice on top of it , whose very size he is unable to appreciate ? I believe that the appreciation of scenery , like that of art , requires careful study , and that a man must familiarize himself with natural objects and ti various properties before he can understand the charms which they have for those who have grown up amongst them . To take a raw Londoner and , with no previous training of mind or eye , to place him in the maid of the finest scenery , is to subject him to an unfair trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals ; he has passed a life in a wilderness of dingy bricks and mortar , and regards the sun chiefly as a substitute for gaslights ; it is no wonder if he feels as bewilderment and awkward as the countryman transplanted from the fields to Cheap . side ; and turns from the real beauties to congenial talk with his fellow 's , or at best , to admire some freak of nature which he can partly understand ? a cliff that seems to be tumbling over , or a rock shaped like a human head . It is said that a man who has grown up amongst the " great unwashed " feels that the first ablution to be a species of ingenious torture ; and we can not expect that the accumulated grime and soot of London streets will fall off at once on our immersion in the country . Indeed , to be honest , I think that there is something strained in our assumed love of scenery . For a change , it is well enough ; Switzerland is an admirable relief to the Strand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but even they would , I think , if they were honest , generally agree that in the long run the Strand is a pleasanter view than the Rhone Valley , and human nature a better ingredient in a picture than hills and woods . Both Lamb and Wordsworth , in the opinion of most people , went to extremes ; but Lamb showed , to my mind , a healthier and more genuine taste in his love of London than Wordsworth in his love of the Lakes . This , however , is beside the point . I care not what people 's tastes may be , so long as they express them candidly and gratify them sincerely . But how are we ever to persuade people to enjoy themselves rationally , when they are in a secret conspiracy to hide their real likings from themselves and the world ? And how are people to be made sincere ? How am I to persuade a man that he sees what is before his eyes ? that he likes the tastes which really please his palate ? that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not when somebody else tells him that they ought to be gratified ? We suffer from such an inveterate habit of self-deception on all these points , that the task is almost hopeless . A lad may often be seen smoking a cigar , whilst turning green in the face and qualmish in the stomach , and not only declaring that he likes it , which is intelligible , but even proving it to his own entire satisfaction . If it were not for this strange faculty of self-imposition , I doubt whether anybody would ever learn to smoke ; it accompanies us through life ; grown-up men may often be observed who affect a dislike supposed , for some strange reason , to be creditable ? to anything sweet , and who as soon as the ladies have disappeared fall upon preserved fruits and bonbons with a marvellous appetite . How many similar practices are common in more serious matters need hardly be pointed out . How would managers of concerts get on , or preachers of sermons draw congregations , or artists i sell their pictures , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our own likings ? But it is useless to point out how many of the arrangements by which society is knit together depend upon this tacit consent to the manufacture of factitious pleasures . Let us , however , ask this one question . Assuming that a man is so eccentric as to really wish to enjoy himself , and not to persuade other persons that he is enjoying himself , how may he best set about it ? And it may be admitted , in spite of the general rule , that there are in fact many persons who really like evening parties , and horse-races , and watering-places , and foreign tours , and that , without a certain substantial foundation of genuine enjoyment , the mere figment , the empty simulacrum of pleasure , would not be so permanent as it is . One great element of the satisfaction derived is , of course , the merely negative pleasure of indolence . We like to obtain a good background of utter inertia with which to contrast the ordinary activity of our lives . It may , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing nothing to perfection ; and the English , next to the Americans , are probably the most incapable race in the world . The Eastern can placidly reduce himself to a state of temporary absorption into the infinite , or allow visions to float before his imagination as formless and transitory as the smoke from his narghili . At rare moments we may enter that elysium far enough to guess at its pleasures . Our blood may be charmed into " pleasing heaviness , " Making such difference ' twixt wake and sleep , As is the difference betwixt day and night , The hour before the heavenly harnessed team Begins his golden progress in the east . But the waking comes quickly ; and the dreams are not altogether easy . They are crossed by figures savouring unpleasantly of reality , and bringing with them disagreeable whiffs from the outer life . The nearest approximation that I have ever observed in holiday-makers to this blissful state of dreaminess is in those harmless enthusiasts who sit in punts on the Thames under some transparent pretence of fishing . The rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the deep stream , the soft beauty of the quiet gardens and woods that slope to the bank , produce a mesmeric influence ; the monotonous bobbing of the float is designed , as I imagine , to discharge a similar function to that of the metal disk which " electro-biologists " used to place in the hands of their victims ; the act of gazing at it dazzles the eye and helps to distract the attention from outward things . The dim legends which still float that at some former periods a punt-fisher has been known to have ? or even to catch a gudgeon , serve partly as an excuse , but chiefly to the repose more delectable by the faint suggestion of a barely possible ity . It soothes without exciting the patient , as the distant plunge of the helped the lotus-eater to enjoy his indolence by a half-formed reminiscent of his long-past labour " in the deep mid-ocean . " It is given to few persons to enjoy such repose for long . We ca lower our vital powers like the animals which lie torpid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always being generated within , and are forced to discover some kind of channel into which it may he direct That channel should be as different as possible from our ordinary walks I life ; for rest means to us , not a simple repose , but the use of a different net of activities . The fault of our tourists is , that they have about as much ingenuity in discovering an outlet for their energies , as a man who , after ploughing in the fields all day , should at night take a turn on the treadmill by way of relaxation . And it must be confessed that , if a man has no love of art , does not care about nature , is thoroughly indifferent to books , and is fitted for no society except that in which he was born , it is rather difficult to supply him with a satisfactory object of amusement . A very large number of Englishmen ( and I dare say of other persons ) are fit only to be human mill-horses , plodding along one weary round . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they instinctively fall into the same mechanical circling , and prove that they are cramped in nature as well as by physical constraint . They resemble that fabulous animal the " brock , " whose two right legs were half the length of his left legs ; and who could , consequently , only live on the side of a conical hill , which he was obliged to be perpetually perambulating in the same direction . Yet few men are so stupefied that they can not , by a little care , select some , more or less satisfactory , hobby ? a selection in which the whole secret of judicious holiday-making may be said to consist . And here is one counterbalancing benefit in the lamentable natural deficiency of which I have been speaking . Our pleasures , I have said , are as artificial as a lady 's hair is sometimes asserted to be ; we live by rule instead of by instinct , and fashion our amusements after some arbitrary model . Yet it is also true that almost any amusement may in time become amusing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the acquired habit becomes as strong as a primary instinct . A man who will take up any special pursuit , from whatever motives , will end by loving it , if he only acts his part with sufficient vigour . The real misfortune is , that not only do people deceive themselves as to their pleasures , but that they only half-deceive themselves . They have a suppressed consciousness of their own hypocrisy , and therefore their occupation never generates a genuine passion . My first rule would be , take up some amusement for which you have a natural taste ; and my second , act in any case as energetically as if you had one , and in time a very satisfactory artificial taste will be generated . It should , of course , give as much scope as possible for varied and long-continued pursuit ; but devotion to any hobby Whatever is preferable to a cold-blooded dawdling in obedience to general fashion after nothing in particular . ' thus , for example , I remember reading the adventures of a gentleman who had made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why he had hit upon that particular fancy did not appear ; he was not a botanist , nor a timber merchant , nor in any other pursuit which had any particular reference to trees . So far as I remember he was , at his normal state , a hard-working clergyman . But he had trees on the brain . He dreamt , at his spare moments , of trees hundreds of feet in height , and covering acres with their shade ; when he had a day or two to spare , he visited the finest trees in England ; when he had a longer holiday , he travelled through the Continent in search of big trees . On one happy occasion he crossed the Atlantic , sailed up the Amazon , and penetrated the tropical forests of South America in the hope of finding some worthy object of his idolatry . Before this he had doubtless reached California by the Pacific Railway , and paid his respects to the gigantic pines in the Yosemite Valley . It is easy to imagine , not to play upon words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minor inquiries ; how he would collect books on trees , pictures of trees , and statistical facts about trees ; how , at moments when the composition of sermons was heavy upon his hands , the vision of some monster of the forest would float before his eyes , and enable him to return with fresh vigour to his work ; how he would gradually acquire the pleasure of being the greatest living authority on one particular subject ; and how he would look down from the heights of a genuine passion upon the miserable creatures who wander aimlessly and hobbilessly through the world , in obedience to the arbitrary dictates of the British traveller 's bible . The happy man who has selected his hobby always excites my admiration ; whether it is sporting , or art , or athletic pursuits , or antiquarianism , or what not , he is at least able to boast of a genuine enjoyment . To be perfect , it should be happily contrasted with the regular pursuits of his life , so as to give a proper relaxation to his faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those artizans whose physical frames are distorted by one special kind of labour , and like them , are in want of something to call a different set of muscles , physical or spiritual , into play . But some energetic pursuit is at all events a blessing , and nothing seems less wise than to ridicule those who have hit upon some pleasure , however unintelligible to the rest of mankind , which may fill their leisure hours . Unluckily most people are stupid . Every genuine hobby is speedily surrounded by a crowd of mock articles . The man who hunts and likes it , as Mr. Trollope has told us , is counterfeited by numbers who hunt and do n't like it . One enthusiast goes to a picture gallery because he loves art , and fifty because they have succeeded in persuading themselves that they love it . Half the accepted creeds in the world are not what people believe , but what they believe that they believe . Other feasts than the theatrical are made off pasteboard dishes , with guests quaffing deep draughts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enjoyment than a time of general consent to be bored under a hollow show of enjoyment . The best hope for tsv ) ? A C y111C " 1 LSI1I TI many of us is that by pretending vcry hard , the pretence may conic to a sort of secondary reality ; and as a large part of the pleasure derived f any pursuit consists in the recollection of our performances , and in the st which they enable us to repeat to our friends , that satisfaction it opts those who never really enjoy the original pleasure , but believe in their assertions after they have made them half-a-dozen tines . There comes n when the past sham is almost as good as the past reality , and a man suades himself that his report of his own ecstasies is more or less foul on facts . Meanwhile a little more sincerity would be a good thing , fot would at least deliver many devotees of the genuine pleasures of for travel from those worst of bores ? their own countrymen . BEHIND EVERY VIEW of whatever event lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perspective sharply curtails the range and qua lily of statements that can be formulated about that event . We suspect that the forester sees and explains the forest differently than does the recreating tourist , We know that the sociologist 's view and words are different from both . Our very slight acquaintance with the perspective of forest conservation leads us to guess that one component ? one implicit assumption ? holds that the worlds of man and nature are separate and that the " laws " which govern events in each domain are irreconcilable and independent . There are profound consequences for forestry . For example , in 1952 , 94 per cent of the nation 's forest fires were man caused . Of these 61 per cent were due to human negligence . No one today would investigate forest fires only as natural catastrophes , their explanations to be sought in the study of " nature 's laws . " Some , however , may see forest fires only as a dramatic , fortuitous intersection between the " laws of man " and the " laws of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a mere overlapping of the domains of nature and man . To put it bluntly , man is not unnatural , the bear natural ; buildings unnatural and beaver lodges natural.l Man is natural in at host two senses . First , he has a natural history . His activities at any one Um have evolved out of the activities of some former time . Second , he qualifies as an object of scientific study . To study the intrusions of a tree blight , the ecology of a fern , or the natural history of the beaver , and , at the same time , to neglect or merely opine about the human effect upon the wilderness as well as the reciprocal effect upon human life unnecessarily warps the forester 's view of the events around him and hampers him seriously in his professional conduct . Thus , the major purpose of this paper is to present a view of man in the wilderness and an agenda of research problems that concern sociology . Hopefully , in such a way , the perspectives of those active in forestry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforced . Several interviews have supplemented our personal experiences to inform the questions we will raise . The interview materials are of three kinds . First , short schedules report the socio-economic characteristics , character of trip , composition of party , and wilderness experience and imagery of 36 persons in 20 different wilderness parties , mostly canoeists , in the Quetico-Superior area during June and July , 1956 . These schedules were directly administered at a frequently used truck portage into Basswood Lake . Second , nine mailed questionnaires were helpfully completed and returned by members of the American Forestry Association 's " Trail Riders of the Wilderness " in the area during July . Thus , 45 persons representing 21 groups were contacted formally . Third , informal interviews were conducted with lodge guests , guides , and service personnel in the area . One of the authors and his family also participated in a canoe trip into Quetico Provincial Park early in September to gain additional insights and information . Cautions about the interpretation of these data must be entered here . The materials are probably not representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sample , but largely on the basis of their accessibility to the interviewers.2 Moreover , the cases are so few that statistical tests of significance have often been precluded from the analysis , and frequency distributions may be misleading . Finally , conditions for interviewing were not conducive to optimum reporting . Informants were literally caught on the run between portage bus and launch . What follow , therefore , are research leads informed rather than confirmed by interviews and participant observation . WILDERNESS CAMPING GROUPS Any empirical investigation requires prior classification of its subject matter . We turn , then , at once to the characteristics of the wilderness campers studied . Demographic characteristics. ? Almost half of our interview respondents came from small cities between ten and one hundred thousand in population , about a quarter from larger cities , and another quarter from towns and villages . Yet , many of these small towns and cities were metropolitan suburbs . Thus , almost 60 per cent of those interviewed lived within a 40 mile radius of metropolises greater than half a million in population . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of metropolitan origin Informants came from the territory of Alaska and thirteen states . Although 30 of the 45 came from four nearby states ? Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Minnesota ? New Yorkers and Californians represented both coasts , and ca ists came from as far south as Kentucky and Missouri . What we may t the " wilderness clientele of Quetico-Superior " is primarily metropolitan potentially national in character . Eleven all-male groups and 10 mixed male and female groups were contacted . One female camping party , apparently made up of college co-eds , was observed on our canoe trip , and we expect the incidence of female out . ings in wilderness areas to increase in the future.3 Even so , four-fifths of our informants were men . The struggle to maintain bans on air travel into the Superior Forest continues . Those opposed to the bans argue that the area will ultimately ho accessible only to canoeists , necessarily very young , and that older people will be deprived of the wilderness experience . A lodge hostess claimed , " Younger people go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to be about thirty-five , they have money and stay at resorts . " An operator of another resort and two lodge roustabouts confirmed this view , stating that lodge patrons were usually in their forties and fifties , while canoeists were in their teens and twenties . Our data suggest that these impressions may be incorrect . Ages of canoeists ranged from fifteen to the early sixties . Although the modal age , representing one-fifth of the cases , was 22.5 years , the median age was 34.4 , and the mean age was 35.4 . We observed fourteen groups of canoeists during our trek in the wilderness and estimated that six included members in their thirties or older . Among those administered interviews or questionnaires , five were not canoeists . Three were on their way to a wilderness resort , and their ages ( 25 , 38 , and 46 ) did not differ markedly from the ages of canoeists . The other two were visiting a private cabin in the area . Both were in their early thirties . We do not contend that the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather , our data show that current impressions about which specific segments will be affected may be in gross error . Marital and parental status were also analyzed . Five married couples were interviewed , and four had no minor children at home . One couple left six minor children at home during the wilderness trip . Twenty-one informants were married . Of these , eight were without minor children at home , eight more had minor children at home , but did not take them into the wilderness area , and five were accompanied by minor children . One formerly married canoeist was accompanied by a nephew , and one widower reported one minor child at home . Twelve informants were single . Wilderness travel is an exclusive recreation . Sociological research has established that one 's occupation is the best single index of his place in community prestige arrangements ( 8 ) , and Table 1 shows the occupational distrirIrR m rn - nwFrnIw - . , bution of the informants , indicating their high social standing . Education data confirm the high status of canoeists . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The modal educational category included persons with graduate degrees and represented somewhat more than a fourth of those interviewed . Only one respondent had not completed high school . figure Camping and canoeing experience. ? The 36 persons interviewed personally were asked about their previous canoeing and camping experience . Fourteen had no previous experience which might facilitate their immediate wilderness travel , and more than half were in the Quetico-Superior area for the first time . However , only one of the 20 groups represented by these interviews was without an experienced outdoorsman in the main party , and that group had employed a professional guide . Seven groups were completely composed of persons without prior Quetico-Superior experience . We shall see later that experienced campers and canoeists typify particular kinds of camping groups , while novices are more often found in other kinds of groups . Kinds of groups. ? Sociological group analysis examines many different variables , but we will touch only upon three variables in this place . First , there is the size of the wilderness expedition . No informant was a " loner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally contacted , was two . The median and mean size , however , were 4.3 and 4.4 persons respectively . Although there was no relationship between size and previous camping experience in general , specific experience in the QueticoSuperior area , as may be seen from Table 2 , was inversely associated with group size . By noting the size of the group , a forester may be able to estimate the proportion of locally experienced campers. figure A second distinguishing feature of the camping group is the duration its outing . Of the 21 groups investigated , the mean , median , and nu duration corresponded almost exactly at six and one-half days . Again , t was no significant association between this variable and general camping experience , but there was a highly significant association with Quetics . Superior experience . Table 3 shows that all informants making trips of live figure days or less were not experienced in that particular wilderness area . Trips of six days occupied about twice as many former Quetico-Superior campers as newcomers , and , in the case of trips of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . These relationships have implications for the scheduling of patrolling activities in the forest . Such activities might be adapted to the type of camping groups known to be in the area . Several highly practical and concrete research problems are suggested . Among these , we include whether the frequency of forest accidents is a function of the kinds of groups utilizing the forest , and hypothesize that the frequency of forest accidents relative to the number of campers in the area decreases as the distance from points of entry into wilderness areas increases , because of the greater proportions of experienced campers in groups taking longer trips . Also we ask whether there is any temporal distribution of such groups during the camping season to which patrolling activities might be geared . Perhaps the preeminence of married informants means that wilderness trips are largely family affairs . When the groups were analyzed by type of member relationships , we found this to be the case . Six types were discerned . First , the " Trail Riders of the Wilderness " constituted a special kind of group by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger boys . Third were five groups composed of male friends and acquaintances . The fourth category included four parties consisting of man and wife only . A fifth type was comprised by three groups including married couples and their married friends and , in one case , children of the campers . The final type was made up of five groups whose members were related by marriage and/or extended kinship bonds , e.g. , siblings , cousins , nephews , etc. , and , In two instances , friends of the larger extended family . Thus , 12 of the 21 groups consisted of members related by marriage or by birth . The bearing of such differences in social relations on the size of the groups studied is evident from the typology itself . Generally , the shortest trips were made by the male friendship groups , and the longer trips by the supervised parties . Family and kinship camping parties were about evenly divided between those making the longer and shorter wilderness treks . Sociologically , the most significant finding here is that 17 of the 21 groups were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of us are interested in what might be called the therapeutic value of the wilderness ( 7 ) . By this , some persons have in mind only the psychological consequences for the individual of his wilderness experience . We would like to supplement this point of view . Among many psychiatrists and social psychologists , mental health is apprehended as a function of one 's interpersonal relations ( 11 , 14 ) . The family and the friendship are crucial interpersonal relations in this respect . Consequently , to strengthen such groupings ? which sociologists find to have been weakened by the impact of industrialization and city living ? may be as important for therapy and even the prevention of mental disturbance as ministering to the disturbed individual qua individual . Certainly , the wilderness experience extends the opportunity for strengthening intimate social bonds as we shall see . The point may be illustrated . There was a story going the rounds of wilderness personnel about a businessman who had selected a secluded part of the forest to sit alone and reflect upon a recent severe financial setback . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tears at the time . Unembarrassed , the man explained that he had " come up here to recharge my batteries . " Much has been made locally of this story is epitomizing the wilderness experience . In our view , the experience of one of our informants who had come to the wilderness with his son after the boy 's return from the military , " to get to know my son again , " is just as germane . Moreover , we emphasize that wilderness travel is not an individual enterprise . None of our informants made his trek alone . PLANNING THE WILDERNESS TRIP That the wilderness is a context for the joint enterprise of intimates is also reflected in responses made by our informants to a question asking how they first learned about the area . Thirty-two of 44 responding to the question heard about the area from relatives , friends , or work associates . Four of these supplemented such information with promotional literature . Four others engaged in activities , such as camp counseling or business , which took them into the area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? relied primarily on promotional materials . Because of the length of time involved , planning the trip may itself provide an occasion for reenforcing bonds of intimacy . Only five of 40 informants indicating the length of their planning activity spent less than a month in the process . Fourteen spent one or two months ; 14 , more than two m. but less than a year ; and seven spent a year or more . Twenty-three per volunteered additional comments upon the planning process itself , indicating that it was a joint affair accomplished in the design of vacation . plans . However , three informants saw themselves as promoters of their derness venture and three as playing a passive role in the process , kiwi . the planning largely up to others . Only two informants said that they availed themselves of outfitters ' assistance in the planning stage . These sketchy notes on planning suggest at least two problems for future study . First , planning may have consequences for the integration of intimate groups , because extensive and careful consideration of wilderness trip detulla necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planning of a " commercialized vacation " where the personal need , of the vacationer ? eating , sleeping , etc. ? are provided for by service personnel . Planning and the wilderness experience provide the sociologist with a kind of laboratory situation in which primary group processes and functions may be fruitfully investigated.4 Second , the " lay promoters " of wilderness travel could well be studied to determine whether they have characteristics enabling their ready identification by those interested in disseminating wilderness values among the population at large . IMAGERY OF THE WILDERNESS These remarks lead us directly into a consideration of the motivation of wilderness travelers . We view motives as vocabularies appropriate for the explanation of behavior in specified social situations ( 2 , 4 , 11 , 12 ) . To discern these vocabularies , we asked 36 informants in personal interviews to tell us in their own words why they were in the wilderness . Analysis disclosed five broad categories of reasons which , taken together , depict the imagery of the wilderness held by those who visit it . The wilderness as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the informants , this theme envisions the wilderness as a place for two fundamentally different kinds of activities : sport and play . These terms are employed in a special sense . Play we regard , along with Jan Huizinga , as superfluous in character , a disinterested , extraordinary and " unreal " activity . Most important , " it is never a task . " ( 10 ) . Play , in its pure form , stands apart from work . When our informants spoke of the wilderness as a place to have fun , relax , or take it easy , their responses were classified as play . Sport , for one thing , may link play with some work form , and , in this respect , there are two major sport modes . First , there are those sports that mark transformations of the play form into work ? professional and otherwise subsidized athletics . In these sports spectators usually outnumber participants . Second , there are sports that are transformations of the work form into play.5 Earlier one of us put it this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball , football , golf , hockey , and tennis ? these sports are " played . " The participants are " player . " ... Yet precisely those sports that arc " played " have become work in America .... However , the " players of sport " are not , literally , " sportsmen " ! Sportsmen are hunters and fishermen , archers , skiers , yachtsmen , or campers . Note that these sports are never " played , " nor may they assume the character of work and retain their identity as sport . They arc peopled almost entirely by amateurs . When they do become work , they become occupations . Fishing is a primary industry . ( 13 ) . Participation is extensive in those sports that constitute transformations of a work form into play , such as fishing and camping , and spectators are practically nonexistent . Moreover , most such sports are conducted in the outdoors , many adaptable to wilderness areas . Now that leisure time is on the increase and people are frequently anxious about how to employ it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for participant sport is striking . For participation in the game is inherently moral in character , while spectacular sport , implying spectatorship , is often destructive of morality ( 13 ) . We regard morality , in this sense , merely as a body of rules governing conduct . The participant sportsman incorporates such rules in his conception of himself ; the spectator often revels in the infraction of the rule and actively cultivates it . The case of present-day wrestling is pertinent . Our informants were evenly divided in their conceptions of the wilderness as a place for sport and for play , some regarding it as both . Fishing ? a play upon work and the most frequently mentioned sport ? is fun for some and a grim affair for others . The wilderness as a fascination . About sixty percent of the informants regarded their entry into the wilderness as a response to a kind of " call of the wild . " Usually , the " call " was thought to be specific to the QueticoSuperior area , often based on some former experience in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adventure . Many informants were impelled to embark on the wilderness trip as a form of exploration , to satisfy their curiosities , or to gain a new experience . Others attached a general positive value to the outdoors . A few were attracted by special qualities of the wilderness usually aesthetic in nature , and one person viewed the " call " as a summons to combat ? a challenge to struggle with the elements . The wilderness as a sanctuary. ? Somewhat more than a third of the informants used this image as a rationale for their trips . Perhaps informants employing the images mentioned before are " looking forward " to their experience , while those thinking of the wilderness as a sanctuary are " looking backward " during their trip . Yet , we hesitate to call this theme an escape motif . The notion of " escape " often connotes a personal avoidance pattern , suggesting a characterological flaw . We wish to " escape " this implication . " Escape " is also construed to be a psychological defense mechanism , as " escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the social character of the wilderness experience . Our informants may be " escaping " one set of relationships , but they are entering another . Leaving the impersonal city , the telephone ring , the monotony of work , and the mass media of communication behind , they enter the highly personalized , fn face , often unpredictable enterprise of the camping party . They find in i wilderness the opportunity to be " alone with others . " Several inform made this explicit . One canoeing bridegroom explained , " We wanted to . away by ourselves for a honeymoon . " A member of another group el:dun mode " I like to get away from people , the newspaper , and the radio , so I can he alone with my wife . " Still another said , " I wanted to find a nice secluded place where I could be with my friends and get away from it all . " In con ? ceiving the wilderness as a sanctuary , the person leaves the established routines of daily life for the more intimate spontaneities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another , or he merely changes the setting of existing intimate relations . Fishing , hunting , and camping trips have frequently been regarded ns male mechanisms of escape . We can hardly conceive that men depart on such ventures looking over their shoulders . The data offer support for our scepticism . Table 4 shows that the proportion of members of male friendship figure groups conceiving the wilderness as a sanctuary is significantly less than the proportion of members of other groups holding that image of the wilderness . ' Rather , it is family and kinship groups and those who act as supervisors of young people who view the wilderness as a sanctuary . Whole families take refuge in the wilderness , and , since each of the three adult supervisors interviewed held this image of the wilderness , perhaps individuals take refuge in wilderness occupations . The wilderness as a heritage . Somewhat more than a fourth of the respondents conceived the wilderness as a heritage , dedicating themselves in a mission to pass it on to others . One informant put it this way : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commune with nature . We 've been out camping , and we want our children to experience it , and their children , and their children after them . For some , the wilderness trip was part of the socialization of the child ; for others part of the socialization of wives or friends . Of course , some of these were " stuck with an unwanted heirloom . " One housewife muttered , " I was roped in . " Then , she quickly , more loudly added , " But I wanted to go . " &77; The wilderness as personal gratification. ? About a fifth of the informants viewed the wilderness as a means of gratifying diverse individual wants . Some felt that the wilderness experience answered a vague unformulated human need . One saw the wilderness as a vehicle for " realizing himself ' ? what we might term autonomous recreation . Another undertook the experience to toughen himself physically , and still another was vicariously gratified by his association with youngsters : Men like myself , businessmen and others who work under pressure , need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while . Besides , being with all these boys every summer keeps me feeling younger . I see myself in them all the time . Adequate social-psychological analysis of such responses requires considerably more intensive interviewing than was feasible in this pilot study . A frequency distribution of these wilderness images is provided in Table 5 . Single images were rarely maintained by respondents , although four saw figure the wilderness only as a locale for sport and play , four only as a fascination , and one each as exclusively a sanctuary or heritage . Usually the view of the wilderness in terms of sport and play was combined with its fascination , its value as a refuge , or a heritage . It was also common to find the images of the wilderness as a fascination and a sanctuary combined . Such imagery is not always validated in actual experience , and some informants volunteered information about how prior images had been corrected by the trip . For some , the sport of camping involved " playing at " more work than had at first been envisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fish , but I only did it two hours . There was too much to do . " Another informant said all he did was eat , and a companion chimed in , " Yes , between eating , and paddling , and putting up camp , one did little else . " Still , the experience eventuated not only in revised imagery , but in some instances in a new respect for winderness etiquette and the acquisition of wilderness skills . We think that new campers should be directly indoctrinated by foresters in wilderness etiquette and skills . Brochures are too often consulted in the reminiscing period that follows the camping activity , and many of the misfortunes of wilderness camping that we observed ? using cardboard cartons as packs in rainy country , losing all one 's supplies to marauding bears on the first day out , or trying to portage a 180 pound boat ( supplied , incidentally , by experienced outfitters ) , and a seven and one-half horsepower motor over a two mile portage ? seemed most unnecessary . Yet , among those volun- tccring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly , others will also return , hopefully more considerate , more skillful , and wiser campers . THE SOCIOLOGY OF CAMPING Several additional problems are raised by these observations . Although they refer specifically to camping and its related activities , they touch on broader areas of sociological theory and research . In the space availablity , they can not be extensively discussed , but the more salient may be listed and briefly examined . Small group research. ? The wilderness camping group is of necessity a small group , and currently there has been considerable interest in the general study of small groups ( 9 ) . There are at least three rationales for such study , First , the small group is seen as a social microcosm so that presumably much can be learned about the larger society from its analysis . Second , large social structures are thought to be tied together in part by the functioning of small groups . Third , one 's conception of self is formed , maintained , and altered in the matrix of close intimate relations . An abiding question in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activities of members become geared into one another so that a so-called " system " is established . Establishing a set of complementary activities ? a division of labor ? among the members of a camping group is undoubtedly an operation on which the success of the venture stands or falls . Mutual recriminations among the campers we observed seemed invariably to stem from some unsatisfactory apportionment or carrying out of camping tasks . There are three group variables which condition the harmonious achievement of a division of labor . First , there is size . The harmony of camping venture is imperiled beyond some numerical upper limit . Large numbers will undoubtedly hinder a joint working out of any division of labor . They can also militate against an apportionment of tasks commensurate with available talents and skills . When this happens , gaps and lulls in camp activities will arise permitting the attention of campers to be diverted from the task at hand to one another 's performances so that some members may find themselves with time on their hands and feel left out of the collective enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shirking . Second , there is the articulation of previously established social relations with the interpersonal relations that arise in the wilderness outing . Camping relationships among peers , such as friends and acquaintances , may be more seriously affected by the size of the party than more clearly defined relationships such as man and wife , adult supervisor and youngsters , or father and son . We hypothesize that the more clearly established the dominance-submission in the relations of campers to one another prior to their camping trip , the more easily and smoothly will a workable division of labor be achieved during the camping activity . The nature of prior dominance-submission , e.g. , whether it has been formally constituted as authority , as in the case of a scoutmaster or a camp counselor , or informally constituted as influence , as in a friendship , is important here also . Third , there is the intimacy of the camping outing . Erving Gof Tian , in a remarkable study of what he calls " impression management , " notes that front- and back-stage regions nicely divide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the places in which such impressions are contrived ( 6 ) . The bath-room , for example , is back-stage ; the living-room , front-stage . Different comportment , language , gestures , and obligations obtain in these two regions , but one salient distinguishing feature is that the audience which we wish to impress is denied access to back-stage . In a sense , this is what makes propriety possible in our daily lives . What is unique about the camping trip is the difficulty of keeping these regions distinct . The toilet is completed almost always within the perceptual range of others ? one 's back-stage is always accessible to others . Camping unmasks its participants . This unmasking effect frequently generates tensions among the members of the camping party , and stands in need of sociological study . By such a study , the broad problem of how intimacies are formed , sustained , and fail would be greatly informed . Social solidarity. ? The central problem of sociology is the nature of the social bond ? how people are held together in association , and the analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social solidarity . First , there is the solidarity of the camping party . Every in-group presupposes some out-group , and groups are consolidated by the presence of some outside , usually antagonistic form . The " combat metaphor , " evoked by most campers at one time or another to describe their wilderness experience is pertinent . A trip in the wilderness is apprehended as a struggle , and this struggle sustains the solidarity of the camping party , but only so long as the struggle is with nature ? so long as the enemy is without rather than within . Second , camping contributes to the solidarity of the larger society which rests , in part , upon the maintenance of a community of experience among persons . To maintain the community of experience , people must share , as William James put it , both knowledge about and acquaintance with similar salient events . On this basis , they can enter into association without necessarily having been introduced . Knowledge about similar events is provided by the mass media . One can ask almost any stranger about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger possesses relevant information , the conversation will be sustained , sometimes transformed into a more enduring relationship . Knowledge about similar events makes us available to one another . Acquaintance with similar events is provided by certain pervasive experiences ? the work experience , the military , the courtship , the blizzard of ' 88 . These are marked by a dominant mood which mobilizes sympathies and mutual appreciations among those having the experience . Such persons need
