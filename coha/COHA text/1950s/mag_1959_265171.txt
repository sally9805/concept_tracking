To Wall Street , the message of the steelmen and statisticians came loud and clear . In heavy trading that time and again left the high-speed ticker behind , National Steel gained 5 points ( to a new high of 84 ) , U.S. Steel picked up 4 ? ( to 944 ) , Bethlehem , Armco and Youngstown all ran higher . And with them went the market . By week 's end , shares on the Dow-Jones industrial average had gained 14.24 points to reach a new peak : 602.21 , and a level nearly 40% higher than the recession low of 16 months ago . <P> The market was almost there a month ago , but fell back . At that time it had hit 601.74 on an intraday basis , then retreated to the 590s . The quick push-pull led the experts to talk about the possibility of a sharp selloff ahead , of " technical corrections , " " testing lows , " etc. , etc . After that , it did indeed slip some 30 points . But it resumed its climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was still talk that stocks were rising because they were a hedge against inflation . Yet in the last six months there has been almost no inflationary increase . More important to market traders was the gain in industrial activity , and the flood of bright earnings reports and stock splits that accompanied it . <P> Only the most bearish investor could ignore a key theme running through the 1958 fourth quarter and year-end reports . It was the salutary effect of a new drive for efficiency and productivity . A few years ago , declining sales usually meant a decline in profits . But now many a company can post smart profits even when sales dip . Goodyear Tire &; Rubber was down 3.8% in sales for 1958 , yet managed to hit record profits , up 2% to $6.08 per share . After a poor third quarter , Reynolds Metals did so well in the last quarter that it actually increased its full-year earnings slightly , to $3.25 per share . Du Pont had the best fourth quarter in three years , with profits 20% better than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24% to a record $2.51 per share . <P> To top it off , half a dozen companies weighed in with stock splits and higher dividends . Rocket enginemaker Thiokol Chemical Corp. , drugmaker Chas . Pfizer and Colgate-Palmolive split three for one , Lily-Tulip Cup two for one . Eastman Kodak , whose stock has nearly doubled in value , to $152.50 a share in the last two years , voted a new share of stock for each one held , then tacked another 9 per share onto its dividend . With that kind of news last week , who could blame anyone for buying a share of U.S. industry ?
