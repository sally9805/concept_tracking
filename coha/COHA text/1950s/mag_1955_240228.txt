The private life of Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian , often rumored to be the richest man in the world , was as heavily shrouded from the public gaze as the vast , subterranean oil pools on which his huge fortune was built . Gulbenkian , a square , bald man of medium height and undistinguished mien , liked it that way . " I have only one friend , " he said once , " and his name is solitude . " Last week , in the spacious , ornate Lisbon hotel suite where he lived since 1942 , Calouste Gulbenkian , 86 , slipped quietly out of the world of the living , still grasping the hand of his only friend . <P> In all likelihood , not even death would serve to clear up much of the mystery that surrounded Gulbenkian 's life . The extent of his fortune is still a jealously guarded secret , and the incredible diversity of his financial interests was such that probably nobody but Gulbenkian himself had more than an approximate notion of them . Even the vital statistics of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburb of Constantinople , less than a decade after the huge oil reserves of Russia were first tapped , Gulbenkian was said to have been smuggled into England by his father at the age of three , wrapped , like Cleopatra , in a rug . Likelier history suggests that he came later and in more orthodox fashion to take an engineering degree at London 's King 's College . Whatever the case , his first impact on the oil business occurred when he visited the oilfields of Baku and published a scholarly article about them in a French magazine . Turkey 's Director of the Privy Purse spotted the article , and Gulbenkian , a lad of 23 , was on his way . <P> Out of the Shadows . In the many years that followed , always operating in semi-shadow while the world 's oil bubbled up to power a whole new mechanical age , Calouste Gulbenkian polished the traits bequeathed him by his shrewd Armenian ancestors . He came to deal on equal terms with most of the great sovereign governments of the West , the mightiest autocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulbenkian himself seldom dirtied his hands with the actual pumping and selling of the oil . He was an operator , an adept at what the Armenians call bazarlik , a dim figure who , in the words of one biographer , " appeared from nowhere with a proposition and usually disappeared with a profit . " <P> Even before the turbulent ' 20s , when the oil interests of the Middle East were being shuffled through a maze of complex reorganizations , Gulbenkian 's talent for cutting himself in on virtually every deal earned him the sobriquet " Mr. 5% . " Meanwhile , the profits he reaped were plowed into scores of other financial interests and one of the finest and most diffuse art collections in the world .
