On the lawn of my home in Southbury , Connecticut , there is an old hammock . It swings invitingly under the shade of two large elms , and on a lazy summer afternoon it is a peaceful place for a nap . I rarely have time to lie down in it myself , but when others use it I get a vague feeling of resentment . I suspect that I never intended it to be anything but a symbol . I keep it hanging there , winter and summer , as a reminder of a tough period in my life when I was a poor stranger in a new land . I came to America in a hammock on a ship packed with refugees , and I 'll never forget it . One day I was the highest-paid stage and screen star in Denmark and Sweden , secure and happy , and dreaming about trying my luck someday in distant America . The next I was running for my life , no better than a criminal hunted by a pack of dogs . The trouble began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adolf Hitler and his growing Nazi Party in Denmark . I mimicked Hitler with a funny little mustache of my own , and I tossed off sarcasms about the Gestapo . My audience roared and my jokes got into print . As it turned out , this was like fooling around with the fuse on a bomb . The Nazis did n't like my act . I got threatening letters and ominous phone calls , and I was singled out in the Faedrelandet , the local Nazi paper . l was attacked by a group of Nazi hoodlums who wanted to break my fingers so I could n't play any more , but I got away after a wild free-for-all . I finally hired a bodyguard , but I still feared for my life . Toward the end of 1939 , when my friends said I was risking a bullet in the back , bodyguard or not , I knew I would have to leave my homeland . I simply could not stop making anti-Nazi remarks when the Germans were around , and I realized that were I to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more useful than a dead one . Shortly after Christmas I packed my things and left for Stockholm . It was a tearful time for those of us who realized  --  and there were only a few of us  --  that it was the end of the happy life we had known , and the beginning of a long , dark journey into the unknown . It could n't happen here , they said . But it did . On April 9 , 1940 , the German armies marched into Denmark for their almost bloodless but shabby conquest . The troops were followed by Gestapo agents , and in a matter of hours they were pounding on the door of my home . My wife , Elsie , had stayed behind temporarily , to wind up our personal affairs . She was an American citizen and the Gestapo left her alone . They wanted me , and they would have strong-armed me out of the house , as they did other Danes on their " enemy " list . They searched my home many times after that , and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The summer was waning in Stockholm when Elsie sent word that my mother had been taken to Dr. Axel Borgbjerg 's clinic in Copenhagen . She had cancer , and the doctors gave her only a few weeks to live . Two or three days later I drove to Hiilsingborg on the Swedish coast , waited for darkness , and then boarded the ferry for the short trip to Elsinore , in Denmark . I stayed in the shadows on deck and spoke to no one , for I was desperately afraid of being recognized . The movies I had made in Copenhagen were still playing in theaters all over Denmark , and my face was subsequently plastered on billboards . I was well known in this small country of 4,400,000 , and many people knew I was on the Gestapo 's wanted list . These were dangerous times , and one could not always be sure who was friend and who was enemy . I got ashore without incident , though , and went directly to Doctor Borgbjerg 's private hospital . My mother was registered there under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about this deception . She was a gentle woman who believed in the essential goodness of people , and she could never have comprehended the degree of infamous cruelty and hate s.sith which men , women and children were being persecuted . She was thin and white when I saw her , but she pretended that nothing was wrong . She knew that I had come all the way from Stockholm to see her and that had to go back again shortly , and she did not intend to cloud these few hours , She also knew that she was not getting any better . She led me out into the hallway of the clinic and made a tremendous effort to climb the stairs to the next floor . She blanched with pain , but she forced herself into each agonizing step , and at the top , when I instinctively reached out to hold her , she brushed my hand away . " You see , Victor ! " she gasped . " I am already improving . The next time you come , I will be back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie , though she had never knowingly lied to us before . She knew she might never see me again . 1 knew it too . So we sat there , mother and son , and said all the empty , foolish things the tongue can contrive in moments of stress . We cried a little and we laughed , and finally I said , " Now , mother , you take care of yourself because I am coming for you soon . The most wonderful thing has happened . I have signed a contract to make a picture in Hollywood . We will all go to America as soon as you are well enough . " That 's all there was . I had told my lie , too , and 1 kissed her good-by and went out into the lonely night . That final minute was the most searing emotional experience of my life , but the scar gave me an immunity for which I was grateful in later years . I got back to Stockholm safely and resumed my performances at the Folkan Theater . But many miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radio in her hospital room , and one afternoon , with the help of understanding friends at the Stockholm radio station , I went on the air just to play for her . It was the only concert I have ever given for one person , and I closed it with her favorite tune , a little Danish Lullaby , by Fini Henriques . She drifted off to sleep as the last note faded away , and never woke again . Years later , in America , I had the Henriques music reproduced on cards , and sent them out at Christmastime . If any of my friends were puzzled by my choice of a holiday greeting that year , I can tell them now thaMt was just a little gesture in memory oiai'ly mother . There are ways , even if it i ? late , that a man can show gratitud . r an unflagging courage and love . On August thirteenth , my wife joined me in Stockholm with the news that she was leaving immediately for New York . Hundreds of American citizens all over Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war , and they were getting out in a hurry by every conceivable means . Elsie had managed to get a ticket on the transport American Legion , and was sailing on August sixteenth from the distant Finnish port of Petsamo , It was the last boat cleared by the British for passage through the mine and submarine zones of the North Sea , and Elsie 's travel permit specifically stated that she had to be aboard . Incidentally , the German government did not guarantee safe conduct through mined areas . I said good-by in a half-numbed state of emotional shock , and muttered hollow promises about following her to New York . Then she was on her way and I was alone in the rubble of my life . Europe was in flames , and soon there would be no theaters , nor movies , nor laughter , nor light . Only blackouts and the sound of Nazi boots . I had no way of knowing when they might march into Sweden . Why ( la I sit here and wait ? I grabbed my hat , ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The news was not pleasant . The quota for immigrants to America was already filled for the coming year and hundreds of additional applications had been submitted . There were perhaps thirty men and women in the waiting room . Thirty frightened people , all wanting a magic piece of paper that would take them across the seas . I sat there for hours , and finally got in . I told the consul my story . " Well , Mr. Borge , " he said , " my wife and I saw your show , and we 've never had a more enjoyable time . I understand your problem and I 'd like to help . If you will promise to make the American people laugh as we laughed the other night , I 'll give you a visa and I 'll get you on that boat. - I put my whole heart into that promise , and I like to think I have kept it . My last few hours in Europe were a frantic race against time and long odds . My funds in Denmark were blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sweden . At the last minute a friend of mine in Stockholm issued a check on a New York bank against my account in Stockholm . I checked out of the hotel with destiny in one hand and some of my show scrapbooks in the other . I had no time to gather up clothes or luggage , and just barely caught the last plane that day for Helsinki . I had never been in Finland before , had no friends there , and was stunned to discover how the country had suffered from the short-lived conflict with Russia . There was no commercial flying , there were no trains , and motor vehicles were gathering dust from lack of gasoline . I could have bought a motorcycle fur a carton of cigarettes , but I would have had to push it to Petsamo . That night , hopelessly defeated , I sat on a bench in the Helsinki airport terminal and concluded that my luck had run out . There were no flights of any kind headed for Petsamo , but l tipped a porter to wake me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I sprawled exhausted on the hard bench , the porter tugged at my coat . He pointed to an airplane with Finnish markings which was warming up on the apron , and said , " Better hurry . They 're going to Petsamo . " I sprinted out , talked to the pilot and learned that his passengers were two Russian officials , headed for Petsamo to reopen the Russian consulate there . I showed them the American visa in my passport . I begged and coaxed and I came very close to - tears . They finally yielded , and minutes later we Wen airborne to the north . The Petsamo airstrip almost paralleled the docks of the Finnish port , and as we circled for a landing I could see the American Legion , with smoke pluming from her stacks . Deck hands were pulling up the gangplank as I ran toward the ship , and with aching lungs I yelled , " Wait ! Wait ! " They saw me coming , lowered the gangway and let me scramble up to the deck . Minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer pulled out and headed for the open sea . Elsie , who had been standing at the rail as I made that miraculous finish , showed no surprise at all , " I knew it was impossible for you to get here , " she said , " but I never doubted that you would . " If anyone should question my amazing good fortune in getting to Petsamo that day , i can only say that Mrs. Frederick Sterling , wife of the United States minister to Sweden , took five full days to cover the same distance and just barely got aboard . The twelve-day run on a 4372-mile zigzag course across the Atlantic was a nightmare in many ways . The seas were uncommonly rough , and there were about 900 passengers on a ship with accommodations for 175 . Hundreds of refugees  --  of whom I was one  --  lived in hammocks in a hatch far below decks . We got little sleep and not much to eat , but these were minor discomforts . We were afraid of nothing except submarines and mines , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the danger zones , and we got through safely . My escape from Sweden was so nerve-racking and so vivid that I could barely talk about it for several years afterward . Eventually I saw some humor in the experience , even though it was on the grim side , and I built a skit around it for one of my radio programs . I have that script at home now , and this brief excerpt shows how Bud Collyer and 1 kicked it around : VICTOR : One morning after twelve days at sea I woke up . went on deck and there it was ... the Statue of Liberty Everybody on the boat started to cheer .. , . They cheered so loud that for five n ' nutes you could n't hear the cattle on the bo . BUD : Victor , svh , : . you got off the boat what was the first thing that struck you ? VICTOR : A taxicab . On second thought , maybe it was n't so funny as I thought . As t look back through the years now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real humor for me during those first few months in New York . My worst headache , of course , was caused by the English language . As a boy in Copenhagen 1 had once stumbled through one term of English , but all I salvaged was " 1 am , you are , he is . " I was often asked why l did not learn English from Elsie , who spoke it perfectly . I was lazy , that 's all . She spoke perfect Danish and that was art easy out for me . But now that I was in New York I had to learn this complex new language , and learn it fast . Otherwise I would have to play the piano in silence , and people would think I was an impostor . They might even think 1 was a concert pianist , and then the music critics would have nothing to write about . There was one good omen . Shortly after we moved into the Hotel Woodward , on West 55th Street , I went out to get my first good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on one paper there was a black three-inch headline which even I understood at once . It read : To HELL WITH HITLER . The paper turned out to be The Hobo News , but to me it looked just as important as The New York Times , for now I knew that I was in the land of the free , I walked back to the hotel clutching the paper , and I said it over and over to myself : To Hell With Hiller . It had a satisfying sound , and I said to Elsie , " If this is acceptable English , I want more of it . " It so happens that 1 picked up basic English very fast , though I have since been told that my system was a form of punishment even the Tartars would have considered too cruel . I went to the movies . I mean , I lived in movie theaters . Every afternoon I walked thirteen blocks to 42nd Street , where there were half a dozen theaters showing fifth-nut pictures . The matinee admission price then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took along a sandwich or cookies , so I could sit through each picture two or three times . I saw films so old they had wrinkles . I endured pictures that even the most hardened television program director would hesitate to show . But by connecting the dialogue to the action , I picked up a lot of words and phrases , even if they were not all according to Emily Post . 1 remember coming out of a theater one night after a day of Humphrey Bogart gangster films , and seeing a pretty , girl . " 1-li , babe . What 's cooking ? " I said , proud of my new Americanisms . " Scram , bum , " she said . She must have seen the same picture . I also saw Donald Duck , but who wants to talk like a that ? When I was n't in the movie theaters I could usually be found in a Broadway-area cafeteria . I listened to conversations and sometimes made notes . On rare occasions , when I was invited by one of our limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food was served at the table , I noticed one phrase with which we were greeted by the waiter , I thought this phrase was a more sophisticated salutation than just " howdy , " so for months afterward , when I was introduced , I would say , " Wdl you have your coffee now or later ? " People gave me queer looks , of course , because usually we were in the subway or standing on the sidewalk when this phrase popped out . In spite of these occasional boners , I was soon able to understand , and be understood , even though the American idiom regularly threw me for a loss , and still does , The first time I got a printed invitation to a cocktail party , with that mysterious symbol " 5 to 7 " in one corner , I went to the appointed place at exactly five minutes before seven , and found that most of the guests had already gone home . When someone explained that a bargain was a " good buy , " I took leave of people by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I committed other harmless errors by making literal translations of phrases I read or heard . One morning the hotel doorman said , " Spring in the air today , Mr. Borge , " I sprang four feet into the air , and he must have thought I was bitten by a wasp . Another time , in a different hotel , I saw this sign in the bathroom : " Please put shower curtain inside tub . " It took ten minutes to unsnap all those hooks , and when I put the curtain in the water , I decided it was a silly custom . 1 still think so . There is nothing anywhere in the world as picturesque as American slang . It was particularly suitable for a performer like me , who had a smOrgasbord accent red who could be , and was , baffled by everyday Ansel-ie.:mese , Matter of fact , - the whole business 14b began quite by accident . 1 was invited to play a round of golf with some friends on Long Island , and at the first tee one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Mr. Borge . You 'll learn something , because she used to play in the eighties . " " How wonderful . " I replied . " Golf must have been a lot different in those days . " The man roared and said , " Hey , that 's a very funny line , " but the wife looked as though she wanted to slice me with a No. 5 iron . Five years later , when l was taking over Fibber McGee 's fibs for the summer , I built a radio show around the various slang expressions used by golfers . Carefully edited , of course . I was similarly intrigued by my first baseball game , and worked out a monologue that I used hundreds of times afterward . It went something like this : " As we were going into Yankee Stadium someone said : ' You ca n't tell the players without a program : I did n't buy one because I had nothing to tell them . A man came up to bat and someone said : ' He 's batting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only two-thirty , and I decided he probably had to leave early . There was a woman sitting beside rne , and every time somebody got a hit she slapped me on the knee and said . ' Oh , brother ! ' I explained to her I was n't her brother . But he must have been right behind her in the grandstand . though , because even. , time she stood up . I could hear him yelling : ' Sit down , sister ! ' " You can see I was pretty desperate for material . During the time I experimented with these routines I was also desperate for money . I needed a manager who could open doors for me. but the influential people took a lofty view of a foreign entertainer who knew little English and had never played the Palace . Presently , however , some Danish intermediaries introduced me to Gil Boag. a semiretired impresario who had once been married to Gilda Gray , the shimmy queen . Years before , when I sat goggle-eyed in Copenhagen movie theaters , watching American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was always an elderly but seedy gentleman who had once been influential on Broadway . Invariably this down-and-outer discovered a boy or girl with talent , and made a spectacular comeback . Gil Boag was a composite of all these characters . He had the Broadway know-how , and he looked like good luck to me . He took my somewhat frayed European scrapbooks  --  I can still hear myself telling him that the Danish word " og " meant " and , " not " ugh " . in English  --  and went out to make the rounds . About a week after our first meeting he trotted into the hotel with a self-satisfied smile . " Good news , " he said . " I 've got an audition for you with Ed Sullivan . " The name meant nothing to me . " Who 's Sullivan ? " I asked . Gil snorted at my ignorance . " The big Broadway columnist , of course . He 's trying to save a revue called Crazy With the Heat , and if you get is good spot you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old 44th Street Theater the following day . Elsie had already started translating some of my verbal routines into English , but I was not prepared to try them . Instead I auditioned a number of piano comedy routines which did not require much verbal explanation . Sullivan liked it , and I then suggested another skit which burlesques an operatic soprano singing an aria from Die Fledermaus . This routine , which I had done with considerable success in Europe , is difficult to describe , but essentially it is musical parody . I hit wrongnotes , the music falls of the rack , I fall off the bench and the soprano is frustrated . Gil told me afterward that he had never seen Sullivan so excited about a new act , and said he had agreed to use me in two choice spots in the show . Perhaps you can imagine how my heart was singing . I had just barely got off the refugee ship with my illogical dreams of wooing Broadway and Hollywood , and nosy Broadway was already saying yes . There was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor Borge . I engaged a soprano named Ruth Diehl , and we began rehearsals . For the first act 1 would do the comic-opera sketch with Ruth . In the second act , as a contrast , Sullivan planned to have me in white lie and tails doing a piano satire ' on the great composers , ending it with a short straight concertolike number accompanied by the orchestra . Some weeks later , after a dress rehearsal for a private audience that included Jack Benny and other celebrities , Sullivan rounded up the cast . " I just want to make a prediction , - he said , pointing to me . " This man Borge will be the talk of Broadway . Take my word for it . " On opening night , just before curtain time , I was sitting in my dressing room happily reflecting on the wonders of destiny . My own name was n't in lights , but I was sure this would be remedied in time . At that moment Sullivan came in with a worried and impatient look . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're going to open the show . You will have three minutes to do the comic-opera skit and you wo n't be in the second act at all . " I was stunned . " My heaven , Ed ! " I said . " I ca n't do a ten-minute routine in three minutes . What about the girl singer ? " " We 're going to skip her , " he said . " Do the best you can  --  and hurry . You 'll be on any minute . " The dream was suddenly a nightmare , I walked out to the wings with my heart crying and my stomach full of stones , Someone was pushing me a little , and there was a crescent of hot light at my feet . I sat down at the piano and began toplay like a robot . Out in the darkness the silence spread like a black cloud , and no one laughed , There was n't even a snicker. 1 can not remember any other detail of that ghastly moment . l froze . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound from the piano , although 1 was told later that 1 played something by Tchaikovsky over and over . I also learned that Ed and others were making frantic motions to me from the wings , but I saw nothing and heard nothing . When they finally dropped the curtain to shut inc off , I had been on stage nine minutes . I did not see the rest of the show , and I was huddled alone in a corner , shunned by the other performers , when the final curtain fell . Ed gathered the cast around him and thanked them for their efforts . Then he strode up to me , tense with fury . " You are the cheapest person I 've ever known , " he said . " You 're fired , and do n't you ever step inside this theater again . " If someone had handed me a gun at that instant , I might have put a bullet through my head . My old friend , Hans Bendix , the noted Danish artist , came backstage and found me standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm around my shoulder , and he was sobbing like a child . We went outside and stood in the dark , paper-littered alley leading to the street , and l told him I was washed up in New York . 1 had had a fleeting , tantalizing brush with success , and Sullivan 's surprising action was a bitter dose indeed . I did not care whether I lived or died . " Victor , " Hans said , " there is nothing much a man can say at a time like this . But please try to remember one thing  --  you can not die before you are born . " We walked along 44th Street toward Broadway , and I thought over my friend 's advice : You canned die before you are horn . My memory went back to that melancholy day in the Copenhagen hospital , and how I had to walk out with a smile when 1 knew that my mother was dying and that 1 would never see her again . No defeat , no grief could ever be as painful as that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sunrise , warm and embracing . I wanted to live . I thanked Hans , shook his hand and went back to the hotel to begin again . In retrospect , and in fairness to Ed Sullivan , I should add that many things were happening behind the scenes that night , and it was some time before r pieced the story together . My sudden demotion was not Ed 's idea . He had confidence in my ability , and he had shown it by giving me those two important positions in the show . But the producer did not share this enthusiasm , and at the last minute he sent Ed to tell me I was literally being cut out of the show . My strange performance , plus the fact that 1 exceeded my three-minute time limit , was the clinching disappointment to Ed , and in his anger and embarrassment he fired me . Ten years later I was in my room at The Waldorf in New York one afternoon when the phone rang and a familiar voice said , " Hello , Victor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents here and there , and I want very much to have you as a guest star on my Sunday-night show . Would you come ? " There was so much I wanted to say . Time turned backwards and once more , as I had through the years , 1 heard his scornful voice lashing me with those words : " You 're fired . " But this was another day , another year . " Of course , Ed , " I said . " I 'll be delighted . " Since that time I have been on the Ed Sullivan show countless times , and I have substituted for him when he was resting or away on a trip . I am proud to say that in 1952 he named me one of his ten " All-time Best , " and frequently took me along when the show went on the road . Once , shortly after we had entertained President Eisenhower at Quantico , he devoted a whole column to my work , and I particularly cherish this line : " Barge tore the place down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Victor Borge , working in the center of Municipal Stadium in Philadelphia , surrounded by 92,000 people fairly remote from him , tore down the place . The Dane scored the most astounding comedy success this reporter ever has witnessed . And when 92,000 let out full-throated laughs , you 've heard something . 1 am happy to add that in recent years Ed and I have developed a real friendship  --  one which , on my side , is based on respect and admiration . In Cincinnati one evening I met Ed at The Netherland Plaza hotel , and we had dinner together . I had been thinking about taking my one-man show to New York , but everyone implied I was out of my mind . So 1 said , as I had to other friends in show business , " Ed , am I crazy or not ? " " Crazy ! " he exclaimed . " III say you 're not . You 'll be a howling success and I 'll go fifty-fifty on the investment any time you want . " Thus encouraged , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lease the Golden Theater on Broadway , I did not want to gamble with other people 's money , and so I financed the show myself . It ran well over two years and grossed more than $2,500,000 in 849 performances . Incidentally , it was the only Broadway show in history that paid back the original investment in less than a week . Once again Ed Sullivan had seen something unusual about me in his show-business crystal ball . His advice was certainly the best I ever had .
