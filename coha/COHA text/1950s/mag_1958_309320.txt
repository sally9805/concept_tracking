MASTERS OF DECEIT ( 374 pp. ) -J . Edgar Hoover-Holt ( $5 ) . <P> Edgar Hoover , who is not and never has been a member of the Communist Party , undoubtedly knows more details about the subject than anyone except those who have been and are not . From the Communist Manifesto to the latest hindsights of a lapsed Marxist , the literature of Communism has largely been professional and confessional , written by insiders . The FBI chief 's book belongs to a smaller but useful class of books by those who , concerned with the suppression of Communism , look at it from the outside . Hoover has written a primer-in a sense a **28;14559;TOOLONG book . It does not claim the philosophic depth of Theodore Draper 's The Roots of American Communism ( TIME , March 18 , 1957 ) , which argued that the party was to some extent a native heresy grafted onto the root stock of American radicalism , but it is valuable as a sober piece of accountancy by an official whose job , among others , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. Communist Party numbered only 22,600 members in 1955 , but Hoover takes special care to point out : " When the Communist Party was at its peak in the U.S. 80,000 in 1944 , it was stronger in numbers than the Soviet Party was at the time it seized power in Russia . " Hoover has followed the course of American Communism with the wary devotion of a seething-eye dog . From the time ( 1919 ) when he was asked to write a special report on U.S. Communism for the Attorney General , he has not changed but enlarged his mind . <P> Bill &; Phil . Hoover briskly traces the story of Communism from its Utopian-socialist antecedents to the present , via the evil trinity of Marx , Engels and Lenin . Along the way , he makes clear that there is really no such thing as " democratic Marxism , " and gives a systematic outline of Communist operations , including infiltration , espionage , front organizations , party discipline , party philosophy-the whole weird mixture of pedantry , conspiratorial byplay , childish incantations and deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work leave them strangely faceless and bearing mostly names like Bill and Phil . Hoover makes it plain that he is sensitive to charges of sensationalism that have been made against the FBI . Perhaps on this ground , he omitted all reference to the Hiss case , on which 263 agents of his bureau were engaged , although the chapter on " Espionage and Sabotage " would seem to call for it ( Don Whitehead 's The FBI Story , which Hoover underwrote , dealt with the case in some detail ) . Hoover 's conclusion is a convincingly humble plea for Americans , particularly intellectuals , to restate the faith of their fathers . He does not mention the plain fact that a great many of these intellectuals have wanted the same thing the Communists themselves wanted-Utopia - but failed to see the secret policeman who lurks behind all schemes to legislate the world into goodness .
