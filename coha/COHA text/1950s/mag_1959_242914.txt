The lofty tone and the customary appeal to moderation were both still there , but beneath the bland surface last week the voice of India seemed almost stern . <P> At the U.N. , India 's V. K. Krishna Menon declared that while his government would be only too happy to negotiate its border dispute with Red China , it would do so only after Communist troops had been withdrawn from Indian territory . In New Delhi , Prime Minister Nehru spent the week consulting other nations that are also at odds with Peking . The ambassadors from Yugoslavia , a country with an old grudge against Red China , and from the United Arab Republic , whose grudge is new , both called on Nehru . Finally , Burma 's Prime Minister Ne Win flew in . " General Ne Win 's call , " said the Hindustan Times , " signifies more than a courtesy visit . Burma , no less than India , is menaced by Chinese aggression along its border . " <P> Fresh from a trip to Cairo and Karachi , Ne Win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest developments within the widening circle of the disenchanted : the U.A.R. 's Nasser was furious over Communist China 's support of the Syrian Communist Party and its vocal admiration for Iraq 's Premier Kassem ; Pakistan was fuming over a set of Chinese maps showing some 6,000 square miles of Pakistani territory as part of China . As for Burma , only three years ago Peking had piously assured the Burmese government that there would never be any question about the Burma-China border . But Chinese maps still claimed huge chunks of northern Burma , and Chinese squatters were beginning to settle there . <P> On his own behalf , Nehru had already sent off an indignant letter to Peking accusing the Communists of stationing their troops inside India from Shipki Pass on the Tibetan border to the North-East Frontier Agency ( see map ) . Last week he got back a blandly conciliatory note from Red Chinese Premier Chou En-lai saying that the two countries ' differences were nothing more than " an episode in our age-old friendship . " But this time Nehru refused to be mollified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further Chinese aggression against India " will certainly be fully resisted . " Added the Hindustan Times : " If another Bandung Conference were held today , it would be a conference of Asian and African countries to consider common action against Han Chinese expansionism .
