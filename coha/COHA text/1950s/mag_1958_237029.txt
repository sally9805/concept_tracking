The one tangible advantage Israel got out of the Sinai invasion was to open up its now bustling southernmost port of Elath to the sea , so that its ships could trade with East Africa and Asia while bypassing Nasser 's Suez Canal . Invading Israeli armies , routing the Egyptians from the Sinai peninsula , spiked the Egyptian guns placed to menace any vessel seeking entrance from the Red Sea through the narrow , four-mile-wide Strait of Tiran into the Gulf of Aqaba and thence to Elath . Now the U.N . Emergency Force guards the strait and permits Israel " innocent passage " into the gulf , while Arab nations protest but do not intervene . <P> Last week at Geneva , the U.N . Conference on the Law of the Sea , which had failed to resolve the international squabble about the three-mile limit of territorial waters ( TIME , May 5 ) , in its final session adopted , 62 to 1 , an article permitting " innocent passage " between straits connecting two parts of the " high seas " as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters of a foreign state . " The Arabs , insisting they are technically at war with Israel and therefore innocent passage does not apply , abstained . The practical situation was not altered , but a step had been taken in the codification of international law that gave Israel 's rights the backing of world legal opinion .
