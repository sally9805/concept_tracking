txt AVERY FOE SEEKING CONTROL OF WARD Louis E. Wolfson Opens Fight for Country 's 2d Largest Mail-Order Concern By THOMAS F. SWIFT The son of an immigrant junk dealer began a fight yesterday for control of the nation's-second largest mail-order and retailing concern , the billion-dollar-a-year Montgomery Ward &; Co . ' Louis E. Wolfson , who at 42 exercises control over an industrial empire with assets of $200 , - 000,000 , has challenged the management ? of 80-year-old Sewell Avery . He said he and his associates were the largest single group of stockholders of Montgomery Ward and indicated that he had received a favorable reaction from large itinancial interests to his proposal to wage a proxy fight . Mr. Avery has been chairman of Ward 's board since 1931 . During his reign the company has seen four presidents and some forty vice presidents come and go because of internal difficulties . Mr. Wolfson owns or has a controlling interest in several multimillion - dollar corporations , including Merritt-Chapman &; Scott , big construction and marine salvage concern ; the New York Shipbuilding Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , D. C. Mr. Wolfson made his announcement at a news conference in the Biltmore Hotel , attended by more than fifty representatives of the press , television , newsreels and magazines . His announcement signaled the opening of the third big fight of its kind this year . In one , Robert R. Young won // control of the New York Central Railroad , and in the other , Patrick took over the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad . In , attacking the Montgomery Ward management , Mr. Wolfson declared : " We intend to do all we legally and properly can to change the management in order to achieve progressive and essential reforms and to restore Mont- , gomery Ward to its postition as the great American institution it , deserves to be . " The accomplishment of this objective , he said , is especially important to some 50,000 small shareholders who " never before have had the opportunity to make their collective strength felt in the company 's affairs . " Reporting that he and close associates had been acquiring stoc in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wol son . said the " ultimate security of the company 's stockholders and their investments depend on a drastic change in basic management and merchandising policies . " " Such essential changes are impossible under the present management , which has adopted a deliberate do-nothing policy , " he declared . He cited figures showing that sales for the last four years had registered a steady decline , while those of its main competitor , Sears , Roebuck &; Co. , had grown at a ? steady pace to the point where they were now nearly three times as great as - Ward 's . Last year , Ward 's sales were about $1,000,000,000 and Sears ' were close to $3,000,000,000 , Mr. Wolfson said . Ward 's net income has continued downward during this period , 1e added . Criticizes Cash ' Hoarding ' He accused Ward 's management of " hoarding money " during the post-war expansion boom , and sharply criticized a $300,000 , - 000 cash reserve set aside by the company in anticipation of , a post-war recession . The management , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a depression . " Mr. Wolfson said that his holdings in the company were considerably greater than those of Mr. Avery , who owns 64,336 common shares , or less than 1 per cent of the 6,500,000 outstanding . In- recent weeks the stock has been moving up steadily on the New York Stock Exchange . Its low price this year was $56 a share . This week it hit a high of $80.375 and it closed yesterday , before Mr. Wolfson 's announcement , at $75.875 on sales of 41 , - 700 shares , On the San Francisco Exchange , where trading was still under way , it rose to a closing price of $78.50 . Some 250,000 shares of the stock are owned by investment trusts and mutual funds .  --  The largest holding is the 105,000 shares in the portfolio of the Affiliated Fund , Inc. , and American Business Shares . Affiliated Fund issued a statement yesterday that the fund was interested in any proposal designed to improve the management ' of Montgomery Ward . It , said that Mr. Wolfson 's proposals would " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montgomery Ward stockholders will be held on April 22 , 1955 , when three directors , including Mr. Avery , come up for election for , three-year terms . There are nine , persons on the board . Mr. Wolfson indicated he would tour the country between now and the meeting seeking stockholders ' views and asking for their support . He said legal steps would be taken to amend the company 's by-laws so as to prevent the continuance of present directors in office . At his Chicago headquarters , Mr. Avery had no comment to make immediately on Mr. Wolfson 's statements , but it appeared certain he would put up a strong fight . For years he has dealt with criticism of his policies from within the company by mass firings of executives . In 1944 he defied the Federal Government when the late President Roosevelt seized the company to head off a strike against Ward 's , which was classed as an essential industry . Mr. Avery 's defiance continued until soldiers marched into his office and carried him out to the street .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
