Will Prices Or Production Be Cut ? <P> <P> AFTER years of effortless selling , a buyers ' market has returned in some industries ; in others , it is just around the corner . It is a strange kind of buyers ' market , coming , as it does , in the midst of what is still a boom economy . For businessmen it raises an important question : When sales drop , should production be cut to bring it in line with sales , or should prices be cut to keep sales up with production ? <P> The problem of price cuts v. production cuts is not a simple , either/or proposition . There are many other ways to counteract falling sales , among them the introduction of new or improved products , harder selling , more advertising , a switch to lower-priced lines . A manufacturer of lipstick cases , for instance , can substitute steel for more expensive brass in his product ; a TV-set maker can concentrate on table models ; a chemical producer can cut back some products while pushing others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate sales , businessmen in recent months have usually cut production , rather than trim prices in an effort to boost sales . This philosophy is well exemplified by International Harvester Co. , which has already felt the pinch of a 7.6% drop in sales . In the last six months , Harvester has trimmed production and laid off 20% of its workers , rather than cut prices . Harvester President John L. McCaffrey feels that , with farm income down and farmers well stocked with machinery , no new buyers would be lured in by a price cut , even one as big as 10% . Instead , McCaffrey 's program is " to turn out new farm machines that are so much improved over existing models that a farmer can not afford not to buy them . " <P> Businessmen put production cuts ahead of price cuts for several important reasons . One of them - and a good one-is that in the supercharged U.S. economy , there are many obsolescent , high-cost plants in operation . As long as they operate , they help keep prices up , dissipate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky-high wage and material costs make price cuts impossible , are not so easily defended . While high wage rates are frozen into the economy , the prices of many materials are already melting , and commodity prices , in general , are more than 5% below their highs of two years ago . Furthermore , as a result of the $73 billion spent on new plants and equipment in the last three years , the productivity of the U.S. industrial machine has increased , counteracting , to some extent , the wage increases . <P> In the case of industrial giants such as General Motors , price cutting raises special problems . Since G.M. increased its profits to a record level this year , while the profits of such competitors as Chrysler , Studebaker and Hudson were dropping , G.M. might well be able to cut its prices substantially . But G.M. , with 46% of the entire auto market already , might thus increase its share to 50% or 55% and drive the independents out of business . Under such circumstances , G.M. , already under investigation by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antitrust suit on charges that it sold too cheaply . ( The Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. is now on trial on charges , in effect , that it sold too cheaply , thus drove competitors out of business. )
