txt On the eve of the second session of the Eighty-first Congress , which convenes at noon tomorrow , all indications pointed to a resumption of the legislative tug-of-war centering on President Truman 's Fair Deal program , with both sides seeking records on which to go before the voters in November . Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Representative Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts , Republican leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives , were agreed to go down the line against the President 's demand for repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act , the Brannan farm plan , national health insurance and any increase in Federal spending . The position of the Republican leaders , given in separate press conferences , added up to a decision to press for a substantial reduction in foreign spending , reduction of wartime excise taxes and a balanced Federal budget at the earliest possible date without levying new taxes . The battle lines for the new session will not be drawn finally until President Truman goes to the Capitol Wednesday at 1 P. M. to deliver his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary statement of his legislative pro . posals will be followed by his economic report on Friday and the budget message on next Monday . " No Surprises " Pledged The White House , however , has given assurance that ' there would be " no surprises " in the President 's legislative program and a member of his staff said today Mr. Truman would demand the same measures he urged in addressing the opening session a year ago . " There is n't any change , " White House reporters were told ; " but simply a strong determination to carry out the proposals the President campaigned for when he wati elected in November , 1948 . " Mr. Truman was putting the finishing touches today on the State of the Union message . He arranged to confer at the White House tomorrow morning with Ad. ministration leaders t in Congress , including Vice President Alben W. Barkley , Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas , Senator Scott W. Lucas of Illinois and Representative John W. McCormack of Massachusetts , the last two the Senate and House majority leaders . Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be entirely formal and confined to the swearing-in of new members and the designation of committees to inform the President of the deaths Of members during the recess . Oleo Bill Slated First Senator Lucas indicated after a meeting of his Democratic Policy Committee that it would be several weeks , at least , before the legislative tussle would get under way in earnest . He said the Senate would return from its joint session with the House on Wednesday to take up the House-passed bill to repeal the Federal tax on oleo margarine . This measure would remair the first order of business of the Senate until disposed of or until Jan. 20 when , by agreement , the body must take up another E ouse-passed bill governing basing points in manufacturers ' pricing policies . Under the basing point pricing system , manufacturers absorb shipping costs in order to quote uniform delivered prices throughout the country , as if all freight hauls were from the same point of origin . The pending bill is designed to clear up confusion by specifying that the practice is legal so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was planned to consider next proposed changes in the National Housing Act . The majority leader was uncertain when the highly controversial civil rights legislation would be brought before the Senate but said " you can rest assured " that the proposal to establish a Fair Ern // G.O.P.RENEWS FIGHT ON FAIR DEAL TODAY // employment Practices Commission would be fought out this session . House plans for the opening weeks of the session , have not yet been determined , but in a year when all 435 members must stand for re-election plenty of fireworks was assured before the hoped-for adjournment on July 1 . Representative Martin gave a hint of Republican strategy in the House when he said a major aim of the minority members would be to cut Government expenditures . He expressed confidence that the Republicans would win a majority of House seats in the November ' elections and added : " The people certainly are dis contented . They are kicking abou high taxes , high Government spend ing and high prices . " The House minority leader said President Truman 's legislative program would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes be doubled . Senator Taft predicted there would be much more opposition to many parts of the President 's legislative program than appeared during the session just passed . He said it was " too early " for him to go along with Mr. Martin 's predictions of a Republican victory in November . On the basis of his recent tour of Ohio precincts , however , Senator Taft said he believed that the next Congress " will be more opposed to President Truman 's program that this one is . " He said there was more concern among the people over the magnitude of Administration spending programs than on any other public question . Determined to fight any increase in taxes , whatever may develop , Senator Taft gave it as his personal view that there might be some justification for a " small " deficit for the fiscal year beginning next July 1 , provided it was coupled with a certainty of a balanced Federal budget for the succeeding fiscal year . Pressed for a definition of a " small " Federal deficit , the Ohio Senator said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 000 in the current fiscal year to about $2,000,000,000 for the period beginning next July , the latter might be considered small . He agreed that little , if anything , could be done about this year 's deficit . Taft Stresses Social Security t Senator Taft listed expanded social security legislation , tax revision and civil rights measures as the most important proposals before the new Congress , and placed social security foremost on the list . He called for a thorough review of the existing social security program before amending the laws to take in new territory . In this connection Senator Taft expressed opposition to any integration of Federal old age insurance with private pension plans . He said Congress should decide at ' what level old age insurance should be placed in the Federal scheme and then let private industry add whatever it could afford but without any legislative linking of the two or deducting one from the other . " Violent opposition " to any proposal authorizing direct Federal loans for housing was promised by Senator Taft . A measure approved by the Senate Banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsors have expressed a willingness to compromise . Senator Taft said there probably would be no objection to a continuation or extension of the Federal insurance principle . The Ohio Senator declined to commit himself on the subject of rent control legislation . He proposed that a study be made to determine whether the housing shortage was still so acute as to cause sharp increases in rents if controls were abandoned . Excise Tax Caution Urged The Senate Democratic Policy Committee took the position today that Congress should proceed cautiously in considering reduction or elimination of wartime excise taxes . Senator Lucas said the group decided it would be a mistake to combine with the oleo tax repealer an excise reduction vehicle . There was plenty of sentiment in the Senate , the majority leader inHeated , to bring about repeal of : he oleo tax as well as reduce the wartime levies on cosmetics , furs , jewelry and leather goods . He ob . ' served that " the House is very ' jealous of its right in revenue raising legislation , and rightly so , " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates " might lose all . " Under the plan suggested by Senator Lucas , the House would act first on the excise taxes while the Senate would act on the oleo tax already passed by the lower house . There has been talk in Capitol corridors of a filibuster against the oleo bill by Senators from dairy states , but Senator Lucas discounted this possibility and said he had n't even thought about inyoking the closure rule limiting debate . Both the Republican Policy Committee and a conference of all Republican Senators will discuss in separate meetings tomorrow the appointment of a group to cooperate in writing a declaration of principles for the Republican party . Senator Taft said it was pro'posed that the group be appointed to work with corresonding groups from the House Republicans and the Republican National Committee . The Ohio Senator said he had never been in favor of a new policy statement by the party , but would not argue with other party leaders about it . " The conference will have to pass on any declaration of principlea and decide if there is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would name a committee of nine from the House minority membership to help draft a new policy statement .
