Good Communists have long frowned on the capitalistic , zoot-suited squares who resist the muscular dedication of their People 's Republics . They call them variously hooligans , Bikinists ( after the big bomb and the little bathing suits ) or just plain Schlurfs . Last week a 25-year-old , gun-toting Schlurf named Jan Brzoza was up before a Polish court , charged , along with three accomplices , with robbery . The court decided to make an example of Brzoza and sentenced him to death on the simple grounds that if a Bikinist is not already a traitor he will probably be one before long . <P> Next day Poland 's official press cheered the death verdict and pointed the moral with a Rake 's Progress report of what happens to those who follow Western ways : " The twin phenomena that we know as Bikinism and hooliganism in recent weeks have reached the proportions of a plague . The trial showed what happens when encroachment of Bikinism upon a section of the youth is tolerated and not stamped out as an enemy ideology smuggled into Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight pants to knives and revolvers , from the daily bottle of brandy to riots and adventures in the streets , from annoying pedestrians to armed assault on people , and eventually from the ' samba ' and ' boogie-woogie ' to jail and the gallows-that is the way Brzoza wanted to develop as a bandit , and then travel to West Germany . Who knows if he would n't have returned to Poland as a murderer and an agent of an enemy-espionage gang ? "
