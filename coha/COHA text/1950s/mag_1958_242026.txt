Encamped in the Corral Room of the Hotel Westward Ho in Phoenix , Ariz. , the National Guard Adjutants General Association heard some frilly Pentagonese . " The lightning strokes of any future war will never again permit us to linger on the soft pillow of time , " said Secretary of the Army Wilber Marion Brucker . Then , explaining the need for a fast National Guard switchover from armory to atomic warfare , Brucker ticked off the proposed changes in the Guard : a paring-down of the present 27 combat divisions ( 21 infantry , six armored ) to 21 streamlined pentomic divisions ( 15 infantry , six armored ) and a 25% cut in the battalion and company-sized units . In all , the so-called " pay-drill " size of the Guard would be reduced from 400,000 to 360,000 men , and the budget sliced by some $52 million . <P> As a Guardsman ( 1915-19 ) and governor ( Michigan , 1931-32 ) , Secretary Brucker well knew that he was tossing around one of the most politically explosive bombs in the land ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . Soothingly he assured the adjutants general that the trimming-down , as well as the anticipated 10% cut in U.S. Army Reserves , would require no discharging of trained men . It could be handled painlessly , he promised , through attrition . <P> Despite the Secretary 's soft sell , the A.G.s quickly passed a whole slew of state resolutions praising the planned modernization of their forces , but condemning any cuts in troop strength . " The Department of the Army , " said one , " are bent on the destruction of the National Guard simply because they do not control the organization in time of peace . " On their side was the House Armed Services Subcommittee , which had already voted unanimously for no change in the size of the Guard. * The A.G.s could also count on some covering fire from the Governors ' Conference when it bivouacs in Miami next month . But if the Defense Department had the stomach for a real showdown , it could still block the funds for any Guard units it considers surplus . <P> <P> * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Air National Guard : $249,145,656.
