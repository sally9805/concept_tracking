txt AN INTERVIEW WITH TRUMAN : HE SEES MAN 'S BETTER NATURE BRINGING PEACE TO ILL WORLD HIS HOPE OF PEACE UNSHAKEN President Truman at his desk in the White House The New York Times ( by George Tames ) COVERS WIDE FIELD He Says Normal Dealing With Soviet is Hopeless - Broken Pacts Cited DEFICIT SPENDING DECRIED G.O.P. Tax Slash Is Blamed ' Red Herring ' Held to . Apply to Spy Hunters ' Methods By ARTHUR KROCK Special to THE Draw Yolos Timm . WASHINGTON , Feb. ** the age of atomic energy , transmuted into a weapon which can destroy great cities and the best works of civilization , and in the shadow of . a hydrogen detonant which could multiply many times that agent of destruction , a serene President of the United States sits in the White House with undiminished confidence in the triumph of humanity 's better nature and the progress of his own efforts to achieve abiding peace . This President , Harry S. Truman , is a controversial figure in the world and in domestic politics . But to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death , his faith that these good things will happen , and probably in his time , shines out with a luminous and simple quality which no event or misadventure of policy can diminish , The following is an account of the President ' current views on the international and domestic issues of his time which I can vouch for as to accuracy . It may serve further to reveal to doubters and critics what manner of man he really is ; and crystalize in the minds of those who instinctively supported him in the campaign of 1948 what were the personal qualities they sensed but did not always comprehend . Undaunted by War Clouds He sits in the center of the troubled and frightened world , not a world he ever made ; but the penumbra of doubt and fear in which the American nation pursues its greatest and most perilous adventure  --  the mission to gain world peace and security while preserving the strength of the native experiment in denibcracy  --  stops short of him . Visitors find him undaunted and sure that , whether in his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world from the destruction which to many seems unavoidable , . as moral force is steadily weakened by the conflict of two great rival systems and by new skills in forging weapons of destruction that make the discovery of gunpowder seem like the first ignition of the parlor match . His reasons for this serenity and this sureness emerge from current conversations with the President on the issues of the time . For Mr. Truman is the kind of American who must be observed at firsthand , free to speak with the candor and natural piety of his makeup , to be wholly understood . In such meetings he answers questions that bear directly on the problems before , him . And these questions and his answers that follow ( the latter put mostly in the indirect discourse which is due to a President for his own protection and that of the country ) reveal the man and what he conceives to be his mission and his methods of accomplishing it better than the formal record can do . Change on Soviet Explained Q. ? You recall the hopeful prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at San Francisco in 1945 when the United Nations was organized . What has happened since to bring about deterioration to the point where a member of your Cabinet can say of it : " The Cold fact is that we are still in a hot war " ? When did you conclude that normal negotiation with the Kremlin was hopeless ? A. ? The ; President said he remembered that time well , and with what good-will toward the Russian people and their rulers he went to Potsdam shortly thereafter . There he planned to offer help for reconstruction , of Russia as well as the rest of the world , on a very large scale . He remembered with pride and sympathy how Russians had smashed the German armies in the // An Interview With Truman : He I Confident of Peace in World // East , and he believed their assistance was necessary to win the war against Japan . But he found that all Stalin wanted to talk about was the abrupt cessation of lendlease ; hence the atmosphere was unfavorable to what Mr. Truman had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake . " But he was " new " then ; the papers had been prepared for Roosevelt , and represented a Government decision . He felt there was nothing else he could do but sign . He had no staff and no Cabinet of his own . Now he has both . The agreement the Russians made at Yalta to enter the war against Japan was the only one they ever kept out of nearly forty . He has no hope they will keep any which now it would be good policy to seek . But he remains hopeful of the outcome . When the Russians , after the Potsdam agreements , blocked EastWest trade he began to lose the last vestige of hope that what seemed so good a peace prospect at San Francisco had survived . Gen. George C. Marshall , he recalls , came back from Moscow deeply discouraged . And when Ambassador Bedell Smith reported to the President from Moscow that the Russians were carefully concealing from the people all facts about the war assistance we had given them , and what our proposals had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vestige disappeared . Barred Division of Japan It would have been the same in Japan as in Germany if the-President had not demanded an American as the Allied generalissimo there at the signing of the surrender on the Missouri . Otherwise the Russians would have divided that country as they have Germany ; and the situation in the Far East would have been so much worse than it is that one can take comfort from it . The real trouble with the Russians is that they are still suffering from a complex of fear and inferiority where we are concerned . If a campaign had not been in progress in 1948 he would have sent Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson to try to straighten out Stalin and the other Russian leaders on this and on our real intentions . Maybe that will be the thing to do some time . But in nothing must we show any sign of weakness , because there is none in our attitude . To appreciate some of the importance of this read " Berlin Command " ( a book by former Brig . Gen. Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He is reliably informed that the ' Russians have 16,000,000 people in concentration camps . This is the way of the police state , which he finds utterly abhorrent . Q. ? In view of your background , training and dislike of debt , how do you reconcile these with your toleration of deficit spending and your advocacy of new spending programs ? Critics of the Fair Deal program say it proposes permanently to burden the more able , diligent and successful with the cost of " insuring all others against the results of their own improvidence , ill-luck or defective behavior " ; that this is very nearly the Marxian doctrine , " to each according to his need , from each according to his ability . " A. ? In no sense does the President tolerate deficit spending . There wbuld n't be any now if the Republicans had not cut the income taxes in the Eightieth Congress . Tax changes should not have been made piecemeal at any time , but conformed to a general and revised plan . This was equally true when he approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not done this , because it was piecemeal also . But then again he was new at the job . Aims at Expanded Economy His object is steadily to expand the economy ? . ? b as to provide jobs and careen , - for the million and a half young people who come annually into the stream of commerce . This can not be done without the measures outlined in the Fair Deal . From a peak of 59.6 millions of persons employed in civilian activities last September , the number has gone down to 56 millions , with 4.8 millions unemployed . A certain amount of unemployment , say from three to five millions , is supportable . It is , a good thing that job-seeking should go on at all times ; this is healthy for the economic body . But the main thing is to keep the economy rising to absorb the new entrants into the stream of commerce . There are now 62 millions employed in the labor force in the United States , including the military . Ten years ago whoever had suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool or a dreamer . Senators George and Byrd call for a reduction of $6 billions in the budget . They know very well it ca n't be done . The President has cut the defense requisitions this time from $22 billions to less than $14 billions and paid for the military aid program for the North Atlantic treaty nations out of it also : He is an old hand at budget-making , and at the last session he sent a tight one to the Capitol and they sent it back with increased totals . He feels he has cut this one as much as can be done hi consideration of the basic needs of the foreign program and of the dynamic domestic economy he seeks to create and maintain . This in itself will bring an end to deficit spending , which represents exactly the amount the tax cut of the Eightieth Congress cost the revenues . He hates deficit spending " as much as Harry Byrd ever could , " and it is only a temporary condition , brought on by necessities which could not be removed by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of more than $8 billions in the defense bill , with $1 billion for the Military Assistance Program MAP found extra , compares rather well with the blueprint of the economizers . He has no policy which contemplates permanently burdening the more able , diligent and successful with the cost of insuring all others against the results of their own improvidence , ill-luck or defective behavior . This charge  --  also that ' the Fair Deal approximates the ' Marxian ? doctrine  --  is absolutely untrue . The President 's aim is to preserve life and property and ex pand opportunity and the standards , of living . " There is n't a drop of Marxist or Socialist blood " in him . The globe shows vast areas inhabited by hundreds of millions of people who want to improve their , lot , and this can be done with our American surpluses and with a moderate amount of our assistance , financial and technical . When that is done , the chief threat of international communism will pass , and this is the primary objective of his policy . Q. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Democrats must abide by platform pledges . Suppose ( 1 ) you construe a pledge in detail differently - from a member of Congress ; or ( 2 ) he has made a commitment to the contrary prior to the adoption of the platform . Is he recreant as a party man ? A. ? The President does not expect 100 percent support from those elected to Congress on the same platform with him . He recognizes that local situations may require some members to refuse ' to follow a President on certain matters . As a Senator , he reserved the right of independence at times for himself . But he does believe that , after a platform has been duly adopted by a convention , all those who have participated or run on that platform should generally abide by its detailed construction by the national candidate . Only that " national candidate , the President , can translate a platform into actionable terms . There are few chairmen of Congressional committees who follow the platform and the President 's construction of it more than 50 percent of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the right arm of the Administration in orderly government by party . If there is any other way to have a responsible government , he does not know what it is . Gives His Stand on F. E. P. C. Q. ? You favor the Fair Employ , went Practice Commission legislation providing Federal police powers in the states to correct employment discriminations , some of which are implicit in the present condition of racial minorities . You know intimately the condition of the Negro race and the limitations of its capacity to fill certain kinds of employment . Many believe that education will be required before an FEPC could operate even on a voluntary basis . Why then is it desirable in mandatory form , requiring that the burden of proof be on the employer ? A. -- The President would not support or continue to support any legislation which deprived a citizen of the right to run his own business , for which that citizen was responsible , as he thought best . The President does not agree that the Administration 's FEPC legislation would have any such result . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and under him it will not be so administered . But opportunities to get jobs for which applicants are fitted by every fair test must not be denied in this country on grounds of race , color or any similar discrimination . The value of the FEPC bill will be to give this position the dignity , strength and clarity of a national policy , not just political , but social and economic as well . For that reason he wants the bill passed , even if it were only to serve as a club in the closet . Early " Inadequacy " Described Q. ? When you became President you expressed a sense of Madequacy which many thought was far too humble for your abilities . Now and for some . time you seem to have dropped that feeling overboard , , where it belongs . How did this change come about ? A. ? When Mr. Truman became President he did not intend to convey the sense of inadequacy which ' many people thought he did . He came into office without a single member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been briefed on the processes or current problems of government , without knowing who the people were to whom he should apply for the counsel and facts a President must have to serve the best interests of the country . Often some member of that Cabinet tried to see him privately to complain about another one . He stopped that : first , by recounting the incident at the Cabinet meeting and asking the two or three involved to work it out ; second , by getting his own Cabinet . Now he is served by the best personal staff he could find and by a loyal and able Cabinet . The problem remains how to find the very best qualified persons outside for counsel and for collecting the facts in special matters . That is an unending task , as well as a vital one . But the inadequacy of the position he was in to do that has disappeared , and that was all he meant at the time . Q. ? It is true that chairmen in Congress get these places through seniority , and it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , or , any other that would be operable ? A. The seniority system by which chairmen of committees in Congress are selected is a defective one because the best qualified men do not always get the jobs . But any substitute that has been proposed is unworkable , and the present system has the merit of keeping order in the legislative process . If the Administration were allowed to pick the chairmen , which is one substitute that has been proposed , the Executive would dominate Congress and this is not only undesirable but contrary to the intent of the Constitution . Q. Will you explain your use of " red herring " and " hysteria " in the context of the spy trials and hunts since you are charged ( 1 ) with not comprehending the gravity of this situation or ( 2 ) playing for votes ' of groups under suspicion ? , A. When Mr. Truman on several occasions spoke of " hysteria " and " red herrings " in connection with revelations about espionage , etc. , he was criticizing the methods employed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . The objective of having only loyal citizens in Government service and in position : . of importance and responsibility has been his fundamentally , too . His loyalty board ( Chairman Seth W. Richardson ) has done much more effective screening of this kind without headlines and personal publicity than the Congressional spy-hunts , which have been- animated chiefly by quests for headlines and personal publicity . These produced the " hysteria " he was talking about , reminding him of the public excitement in the days of the Alien and Sedition Acts , the Know-Nothing Movement , the Ku Klux Klan and the Red scares of 1920 . And he has never changed his opinion that the Way the Un-American Activities Committee handled the Hiss and other cases was a red herring to distract public attention from the blunders and crimes of , the Eightieth Congress . When the President was chairman of the special Senate committee during the war , he followed a method which he sought to endorse by contrast when he made the above comments about hysteria and red herrings . Whenever he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war program , he privately communicated the facts to the departments concerned , and usually it was corrected or averted without the kind of publicity that unfairly shakes public confidence , and spreads through the more than two millions in Government employ a feeling of insecurity in their jobs which hampers and damages their work . The result was that no major scandal occurred in the war . This is the responsible method which , because it was not followed in these other matters , impelled him to say what he did . The Government service is 99 per cent plus loyal and secure . If the facts about a Government employe show the contrary , out the man will go at no expense to public stability  --  though , it is true , without a headline for a politician who has that chiefly in his mind . * * Such are the President 's statements of his views . Those who have the privilege , necessarily a limited one , of searching in this way the mind and purpose of Harry S. Truman usually come away with faith in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conviction that , whether ' or not he has the greatness which the times require  --  a question that must be left to the verdict of history  --  he means to preserve the basic system by which this nation attained its greatness , and to achieve and maintain that peace which has been its highest ' aspiration since 1783.
