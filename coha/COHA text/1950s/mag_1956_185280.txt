Envious Americans have long considered the French their unchallenged masters in the art of theatrical nudity , and many a Minsky patron has dreamed of the unlikely day when he might graduate to an evening of the famed Folies-Bergre . But the fact is that the Minsky form of perambulant , progressive nudity known as the striptease is an American art form . <P> One day some five years ago ( reportedly after a conversation with Bing Crosby ) , a Parisian antique dealer named Alain Bernardin got to ruminating over the difference between U.S. art forms and those of his own country . " There is nothing , " he concluded , " as horrible as a naked woman standing stock still on a stage with an idiotic look on her face . " Crazy . With this thought to goad him , and a stock of U.S. period pieces to lend atmosphere , Bernardin opened a night club in the style of the wild and woolly West , complete with waiters in candy-striped shirtsleeves , banjo players and a suitably active , shapely and deciduous stripper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horse Saloon caught on like a prairie fire . By last week Le Striptease was sweeping Paris from Montparnasse to Montmartre , and even seeping out of the city to enliven the sleepy provinces . " It 's bigger than the cancan , " exulted one nightclub owner . <P> Last week in more than 50 Parisian nightclubs , strippers with such names as Rita Cadillac and Kira Tekitoff were joyously peeling . Le cache-sexe , the French word for the irreducible garment - the G-string - was officially listed in the latest edition of the dictionary Larousse , and most importantly , scores of shopgirls and typists were powdering their delicate epidermises to take part in the first qualifying heat of the 1956 International Amateur Striptease Contest . <P> Cerebral . In crossing the wide Atlantic , the Minsky strip-act has undergone a subtle sea change . There are few , if any , bumps and grinds in the French version , and no unseemly cries of " Take it off ! " from rows of bald heads . " The French , " explains the Crazy Horse 's Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to think about . " Some of the thinking variations now going on in Paris : a drunken bride takes off her clothing in desultory fashion as she awaits her new husband ; a strip-quiz in which each correct answer gives the audience participant a right to take off one garment from the girl in the spotlight . One nightclub promised a strip to the accompaniment of suitable verses from Baudelaire , an other to the music of Thais . <P> Whatever the gimmick , Frenchmen of all walks of life were enthusiastic about the strip . " I support the striptease out of admiration for female loveliness and respect for human dignity , " boomed 73-year-old Professor Edmond Heuze of the Beaux Arts Academy . " It 's better , " said Amateur Champion Yvette Masson , a typist , " than being cooped up in an office . "
