It was the kind of TV program that no sponsor could possibly afford : the high-priced talent ranged from Board Chairman Robert Sarnoff ( delivery somewhat stiff ) to Broad Comic Milton Berle ( delivery better than ever ) . Packed into a two-hour closed-circuit preview of the new season were all of NBC 's top stars , presenting snippets from all of the network 's evening programs . The audience : station personnel , admen and newsmen in 140 U.S. cities . Madison Avenue time buyers , the cold-eyed crew whom Bob Hope greeted as " the grey flannel Mafia , " seemed satisfied at show 's end that their share of the country 's picture tubes might be worth the price . <P> Not that NBC was burdened with new ideas : there was the sound of western gunfire , the brassy clangor of variety shows , a hint of " adult " comedy . All the old standbys were there-Dinah Shore , Tennessee Ernie Ford , Perry Como . The newest TV face turned out to be one of the oldest in show business : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , he was involved in an embarrassingly corny act , plugging his own forthcoming dramatic series alongside a stripper , each of whose removable scanties carried an announcement for some NBC attraction . <P> One of the most welcome oldtime newcomers : Fred Astaire , warming up for a song-and-dance series with a nifty new partner , Barrie Chase . And it was all guaranteed by NBC to come in a superattrac-tive package-600 hours of live color ( an average of two hours a day ) , 100 big " specials , " more emphasis on public affairs . <P> Only one new quiz show was announced , Brains and Brawn , in which intellectual quiz athletes team up with actual musclemen . ( After the brains match memories in familiar fashion , the brawnier contestants match skills in athletic derring-do . ) An announcer 's throbbing voice pledged continued loyalty to Twenty-One . But the irrepressible comics had a field day kidding the quizzes . " When the subject of my new show came up , " cracked Bob Hope , " all General Sarnoff said was , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' " <P> It remained for Milton Berle , Mr. TV himself , coming back to a regular show after three years , to warn the network that when it does get around to promoting new ideas , they had better be good . " I 'll be on every Wednesday night , except when we 're pre-empted by a spectacular , " he quipped . " You know what a spectacular is . That 's a word invented by a network vice president meaning ' Let 's make the show longer and more expensive , and maybe they wo n't notice how lousy it is . ' " To judge from last week 's preview , NBC 's new season will not be a spectacular .
