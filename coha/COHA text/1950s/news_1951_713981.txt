txt In his second quarterly report to the nation Mobilization Chief Charles E. Wilson indicated clearly that he is less concerned about the problem of production than that of runaway prices . " The initial surge of post-Korea inflation , " he said , " has been halted  --  at least temporarily . The crucial question is : How long will the present lull last , and can the Iine be held when heavy pressures appear ? " Present plans call for a boost in military spending in the next twelve months from the present rate of ' $35 billions a year to approximately $65 billions . This will mean an enormous increase in spending power . But that spending powerwill not be offset by a corresponding increase in consumer goods . On the contrary , substantial cutbacks lie ahead for such key items as automobiles and other consumer durable goods . By next summer , according to Mr. Wilson 's estimate , the " inflation gap " will amount to some $20 billions . In spite of this ominous picture , reports from Washington indicate that Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthening , the present economic controls . It is showing little , if any , evidence that it is prepared to resist the pressure from interested groups for the elimination of the price rollbacks provided for under the original Defense Production Act . Yet , according to Economic Stabilizer Eric Johnston  --  who presented figures to support his conclusion  --  this alone could mean a rise of 5 to 7 per cent in the cost of living over the next twelve months . The time has come , it seems to us , to ask when Congress is going to cease merely reflecting the passing emotional moods of the public and begin acting like an adult and intelligent group of legislators . When the Korean war began at the end of June last year this country was in the midst of serious inflation  --  inflation that had nothing whatsoever to do with the international situation . It stemmed from the Government 's overstimulated housing program and from rampant abuse of consumer credit . The Administration itself failed , until Korea , to recognize the seriousness of this situation , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhauling the revenue law so as to grant sweeping relief from the prevailing excise taxes , although the Federal Government was even then running a deficit at the rate of $5 billions a year ! Once the Korean war was under way the President outlined to Congress his plan for financing a new military effort on a pay-as-you-go basis and asked for certain limited powers in the way of conserving key materials and reducing the threat of further inflation . Now Congress , which had previously been in a deep sleep , suddenly came to life . It came to life , however , only to plunge from slumber into hysteria . Instead of acting on the carefully conceived proposals of the President with the promptness that was so important in the circumstances , it permitted itself to be swept off its feet by the public 's mood of the moment , with its emphasis on profiteering and scare-buying . For a time it was touch-and-go as to whether the legislators would succeed in forcing upon the President compulsory controls for which he had not asked , did not want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . In the end calmer counsel prevailed , and Congress , while still insisting that the Administration be vested with powers of over-all direct controls , compromised by placing these on a stand-by basis . But it spent so much time wranglingl over the details of this program that it was nearly two months before the President obtained the limited powers for which he had asked . Had the fighting in Korea continued to be a localized war there might never have been any need for invoking the stand-by direct controls . But as we now know , the fighting was not so contained . What completely altered the picture was the entrance of Communist China into the war in late November . That event brought to Ithe United States and to the free nations as a whole a new perception of the dangers in store , not merely - in Korea but everywhere , from the leaders of the Kremlin . It introduced new dimensions into our preparedness program , from a military and an economic standpoint , and a new imperative in terms of time . History will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress a year ago when it insisted that a police action in Korea warranted the establishment of a sweeping system of direct controls . We doubt that it would regard as lightly the failure by that same body to give the President the powers he regards as imperative for dealing with a problem of the nature and proportions of that we have been facing since last November .
