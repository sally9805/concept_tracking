UNHEARD WITNESS ( 317 pp. ) - Ernst Hanfstaengl-Lippincott ( $4.95 ) . <P> <P> Schicklgruber just laughed when Hanfstaengl sat down at the piano , but when he started to play . . . <P> . . . Schicklgruber-Hitler was delighted and Naziism began to take shape . That , at any rate , is the way Ernst ( " Putzi " ) Hanfstaengl tells it . A sometime Harvard student ( his grandmother was a New England Sedgwick ) and longtime Hitler crony , Putzi* began supporting the Nazi Party in 1922 and labored to make it palatable to Germany 's " best people . " <P> With this aim in mind , Putzi excitedly told Adolf about the hypnotic effect of college cheering sections at U.S. football games and , at the piano , demonstrated the " buoyant beat " of U.S. brass bands . Recalls Putzi : " I had Hitler fairly shouting with enthusiasm . ' That 's it , Hanfstaengl , that is what we need for the movement , marvelous , ' and he pranced up and down the room like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rah ! " refrain of Harvardmen , by Putzi 's account , became the thunderous " Sieg Heil ! Sieg Heil ! " of the Brownshirt demonstrations . Storm Trooper bands blared their goose-step rhythms with a between-halves unison . Such Nazi slogans as Ein Volk , Ein Reich , Ein Fhrer were patterned on the effective use of catch phrases in U.S. election campaigns . As Hitler 's " American expert , " Putzi modestly admits : " I suppose I must take my share of the blame . " <P> The Mamma 's Boy . An accomplished pianist , art dealer and amateur historian , Hanfstaengl looked down his cultural nose at Hitler . Not only did the man resemble a suburban barber on his day off ; he could not tell a Caravaggio from a Michelangelo . Worse , he seldom paid his debts , loved to stuff himself with pastry and whipped cream , sat delightedly through three showings of King Kong . Hitler , says Putzi contemptuously , was a Muttershnchen ( mamma 's boy ) whose impotence may have been caused by syphilis and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Hitler was also a tremendous orator with a droning voice whose hypnotic effect " has never been equaled , " and Putzi Hanfstaengl dreamed of becoming the power behind the drone . With a quality of mind that Germans call dummschlau-a combination of cunning and stupidity-he thought he could use the Nazi barbarians to defeat the domestic Communists and Socialists , and then craftily make sure that Hitler 's " revolution " would be orderly and beneficial . <P> 20-20 Hindsight . In 1937 , a badly-scared Hanfstaengl fled Germany , convinced that the Nazi " wild men " were about to kill him . He spent World War II shuttling between British detention camps and the U.S. , now lives in Munich . <P> Putzi 's book , probably his last attempt to capitalize on his career as Naziism 's foremost political pianist , often reads like an edition of Munich Confidential . Politically and morally , it has the usual 20-20 hindsight . Its value for future historians will lie mostly in the gossipy anecdotes that show Hitler in his moments of off-platform relaxation-some of them very comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer hall Putsch , threatens to commit suicide , but allows himself to be easily disarmed by Hanfstaengl 's pregnant wife . <P> <P> * Means " little fellow " in Bavarian dialect .
