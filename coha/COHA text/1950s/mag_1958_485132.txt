New Communist guerrilla activities inside its borders and skirmishes with the Pathet Lao on the Mekong River signify that Thailand faces searching new tests of its ability to survive as an independent , democratic nation . Increased insurgency pressure upon the Bangkok government has been expected since the end of the war in Vietnam , but in fact Communist takeovers in Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia have scarcely touched Thailand except for the problem of 50,000 refugees driven across its borders by the tide of war and its aftermath . I recently made contact with the Thai insurgents in northeast Thailand , 350 miles from Bangkok in a remote hilly region that the " liberation army " has controlled since it formed there to fight the Japanese invaders thirty-three years ago . Some of today 's army are sons and daughters of those who outlawed themselves by taking up arms to resist the Japanese invaders in opposition to their own government , which had chosen to collaborate . Some of the original army , many of them now old men , still live in the jungle . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly thirty years in exile in Paris and Peking . Those I met were the younger generation , although their leader claimed to have been fighting for twenty years . Before the meeting could be arranged I had to promise my guide , who is also an old friend , that I would reveal no locations or identities . That was easy , as I did not know exactly where we were and the only name I knew was my friend 's . We were not far from one of the provincial capitals of the northeast , the area that Bangkok regards as presenting the most serious insurgency . The reasons go far back ; it is the poorest region of Thailand , the land is less fertile , the climate unpredictable , and the population both poorer and ethnically more mixed . We had driven from town in a brightly painted mini-bus of the sort that carry passengers all over rural Thailand . It Neil Kelly writes from Bangkok for a number of Australian ' papers and for The Observer , London . Some of his recent reports on Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only safe vehicle to travel in , my friend explained , as ordinary cars were likely to be shot at . He had told me to wear a colorful shirt , since anything that looked like the army or police might also draw a shot from the Communists who controlled the area at night . It was a nervous start to the evening . I was alone in the passenger compartment . My friend in front had turned off the lights . Rain gusted through the open sides of the bus so heavily that I was unaware of another figure sitting next to my friend until the engine started . We stopped after a few minutes and the newcomer got out and fired two shots from a gun . We moved on again with undergrowth enclosing us and the little bus lurching and slithering before we ran onto smoother ground and stopped . I could see yellow glimmers from a house and that the man who had joined us on the road was tall , wore dark shirt and trousers and carried an American M16 rifle . He spoke to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle slung over his shoulder . Then , motioning us to follow , he led off into the dark undergrowth . I saw no sign of life until we moved toward some light , which disclosed a small food shop with tables and chairs ; a charcoal cooking stove ' and several large aluminum cooking pots . A gas lamp threw a bright light . As we sat down at a table three other men , carrying what appeared to be World War II rifles , emerged from the shadows to join us while a young woman busied herself with glasses of hot tea . One of the men began to speak to me , my friend hesitantly stopping him from time to time to translate his remarks , which went like this : Thailand does not need foreigners. - Thailand does not need the Americans . They must all go . We have our own army , our own weapons , our own air force . Why does the government have foreigners here ? The Americans have been bad for Thailand . The government in Bangkok neglects the poor people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangkok and none in ' the villages . There are no roads , no doctors , no medicines , no water , no schools , sometimes no food . When soldiers or police come to the villages they do not help but demand food for themselves even when there is none in the village . And the head man of the village has to find girls for them . it thieves steal a buffalo the police do nothing but we chase the thief and get the buffalo back . There is no doctor when people are sick . We have doctors and medicines and we help the sick people . We have stopped the people using opium and stop them gambling . Opium is bad for them and they are too poor to gamble . There was a compelling logic about some of his statements . For instance : If the government helped the people as we do , they would have no problems . Some people here went to jail for cutting down a tree. - But a big contractor cut down a , forest and nothing happened to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then say we have done it . They also send men to spy on us . " He stood up indicating our meeting was over so I quickly shot some questions at him . Standing impatiently he ignored most of them including those about Communist numbers , casualties , weapons and tactics . He said he was 40 years old , and had never been out of Thailand . All their people in the jungle were Thais . No , there were no Vietnamese , Chinese or Lao . ( The Thai authorities say there are small groups of Vietnamese , Chinese and Lao among the insurgents . ) The farmers gave them food " because we help them . " ( All his claims of helping the villagers and farmers were confirmed by officials . ) " Can you ever beat the army and police ? , " I asked . " In three years , " he replied without hesitation . By the time we had regained the highway back to the/ town , I had come to the conclusion that the Communist I had just talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although clearly he had had some instruction in Marxist doctrine , he seemed more motivated by his own experience than by an ideology . He appeared ignorant of international politics but knew plenty about the plight of the impoverished villagers in his own area and the failure of successive , Thai Governments to help them . Luckily for the Thais they now have a government that appears able and willing to adjust to the changes that have occurred elsewhere in Southeast Asia and to find fresh policies for their own problems , including the insurgents . Even the monarchy , which as recently as 1932 was absolute and all-powerful , has made imaginative changes . King Bhurnipol and Queen Sirikit , encouraging the overthrow of the military dictators , have placed their immense prestige behind the democratic government , have given valuable tracts of their own to landleSs peasants and have adopted a simpler style of life to bring themselves closer to the people . Once international jet setters , they have abandoned foreign travel , declining all invitations . " Our presence in Thailand gives our people a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding population sundered by strident inequalities and ruled by a " military dictatorship that encouraged corruption in its own ranks and in the police and armed forces , has long been fertile ground for communism . The United States lavished military and civil aid on the country , but too much of the money went into the pockets of corrupt leaders . For twenty years the Thais were involved in the West 's attempt to halt the spread of communism in Southeast Asia . The American failure was a lesson not lost on them ; they recognize that Coinmunist insurgencies spring from local conditions and can not bedefeated by arms alone . Corruption and rural neglect are the two greatest allies the Communists possess and the worst enemies of democracy . Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj 's government , in office less than a year , has tackled both problems with imagination and courage . In Bangkok recently 200 mutinous policemen attacked and wrecked Mr. Kukrit 's home , the outrage being prompted by government measures to check the powers of the police , who even today can not comprehend that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just twenty years ago the police chief ( then General Phao ) was not only a CIA agent but also unofficial boss of the opium trade , sometimes in uneasy partnership with the supreme army commander , General Sarit . His police force was involved in every aspect of the narcotics trade , with the money passing up the chain of command so that by the time Phao was forced to flee for his life to Switzerland an immense and secret bank account awaited him in Zurich . , Phao was the most spectacular example of the corrupt policeman , but many who remain continue to extort money from the population . Truckdrivers are among the easiest victims for ordinary policemen . They can be held for hours at highway , checkpoints , on the pretext that their trucks are overloaded . To avoid the delay and harassment each driver normally hands over $2 to $5 to the police . Other examples of petty corruption confront the Thais every day , forcing them to pay bribes for the quick issuance of any sort of official permit , license or document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved still in arms trafficking and almost certainly retain a role in the opium trade from northern Thailand , now the major source of the world 's heroin . The local police are often the peasant 's only contact with authority , and this position is used to extort money ; women and food from the village people . Bangkok students , " leaders of the 1973 revolution which overthrew the military dictatorship , are active in rural areas , instructing the uninformed in politics and civil rights and defense against cor-ruption . The police , - fearing the new influence of the students , condemn them as Communists and warn the population that " without the police in control the Communists will come . " The students claim the police mean to suppress the liberties won two years ago and specifically blame them for the unsolved murder of more than twenty farmers in ' recent months . All the dead men were engaged in political activities aimed at improving farmers ' conditions . The government 's new program for the rural areas promises not only to make life easier for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuild the country 's political structure . Approximately $200 million a year have been allocated to the tambon project program ( a tambon is a group of villages ) which channels cash to every village for local improvements . So far , most of the money has been spent on improved or new roads , schools , health centers , electricity , reservoirs , canals and drainage systems . The benefits flowing from a tambon project are manifold : more cash income for the farmer , who now has something productive to do in the dry season when there is little work on the land ; a better image for the central government , which is seen by the villagers for the first time helping rather than exploiting them ; a real impetus to local government , thereby reducing centralized power and demonstrating grass-roots democracy in action . Other minor moves toward a welfare state have been made to help the poorest city citizens . For instance , those in Bangkok who earn less than $40 a month are now eligible for free travel on busses , free medical treatment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ComMunist insurgents in the north , northeast and south of the country , the government operates a cool , moderate campaign , Until a year ago the government frequently overreacted to Communist activity , making new enemies with heavy air strikes which killed innocent people and destroyed friendly villages . In this they were following American policy until its futility in Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia was understood . Today , government tactics are similar to those of the insurgents : constant deep patrols into enemy areas , ambushes and surprise attacks at night , relentless probing to deny rest to the enemy . More than 9,000 of the " liberation army " have been captured or have surrendered in the past five years but , remarkably , only two of them are in prison . Insurgents who surrender find an amnesty , center , not a prison , awaiting them ; they are even paid in cash for weapons they hand over . They are well housed and fed and invited todiscuss their reasons for taking up arms against the government . Before long they are free to go where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some hard-liners oppose this " soft " policy but the chief , of security , General Saiyud , supports it enthusiastically . " We believe these men should be forgiven and helped to make a new life and become good citizens . Some inevitably rejoin the Communists , but very few . " Significantly , General Saiyud 's former " Communist Suppression H.Q. " is now called " Internal Security Command . " He believes there is no purely military answer to the " liberation army , " but , he adds , it alone can not win Thailand for communism . The insurgents themselves appear to accept this theory , for although they have better ' weapons and thus heavier fire power than ever before , armaments are not the heaviest traffic coming into Thailand across the Mekong . At the moment it comprises political instructors , teachers armed with movie projectors , films , books and pamphlets from Hanoi and Moscow . Thus the Communist cadres are putting their major effort into political instruction , propaganda and general welfare work that offers a helping hand to the population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the conflict  --  a truth that always escaped those who waged the losing battle against communism in Indochina . ?
