txt While the rising strength of the British pound stirs speculation that it may be made convertible into dollars once again , France 's franc flounders ever-deeper in a sea of money troubles . Last year Premier Antoine Pinay boldly tried to tackle the inflation which has crushed the franc to less than 4% of its pre-war value . But . after nine months in office , he was ousted when Parliament balked at his plans for a balanced budget . Now Monsieur Pinay 's successor , Rene Mayer , is back on the path of inflationary financing which the Pinay government sought to avoid . While the franc depreciates in value at home , it stays arbitrarily pegged at an official value of 350 to $1. in foreign trade dealings . So France 's rising domestic prices are reflected in uncompetitive prices on French goods in terms of foreign currencies . The result is a steadily widening gap between what France buys and what it can earn abroad from exports . Mayer 's Familiar " Solution " To avert bankruptcy , Premier Mayer could devalue the franc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  thus making French goods cheaper for foreign buyers and stimulating France 's falling exports . But he is resolved to avoid this step if he possibly can . And his reluctance to devalue is not accompanied by any intention to make an assault on France 's basic inflation disease . His proposed " solution " is a familiar palliative less painful politically than either an anti-inflation drive or a devaluation . He wants more U. S. ' aid to bridge France 's foreign trade gap and to help cover his budget spending , and he is expected to ask for it when he visits Washington this week . French prices  --  when compared with those of their nearest foreign competitors ? run 25% higher on automobiles , 15% higher on chemicals and 40% to 70% higher on many food products , according to one recent survey . Helping inflation to keep these prices jacked tip at export-stifling levels are the subsidy and tax policies of the French government . By these devices the government has " protected " large segments of the economy from adjustment to competition and world demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old habits of restricted production and excessive prices . The government subsidizes the movie industry , the shipbuilding industry , the aircraft industry , the sugar beet industry , the vegetable oil industry , the wine growers and most exporting industries . Other farm products have " guaranteed prices " financed by the state . And the nationalized industries are subsidized , too , of course . " By trying to protect everybody . " comments one French banker . " the government may wind up protecting nobody . " Another wsv government policy pushes prices upward is through taxes on production and turnover . How much of a key is " sound money " " to a nation 's economic health and its ability to recuperate from the devastations of war ? Here is a report on France . Tomorrow we publish a report on another country which has made desperate efforts to halt inflation and stabilize its currency . vide revenues for social security , pensions and other budget items add 22% to the price of coal , 50% to the price of wood , 20% to the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Balance Widens These inflated prices mean that France can not sell her goods in a world competitive market . And this explains why France 's excess of imports over exports hit a record 31,180 million in 1952  --  a 21% increase over the 1951 gap of $970 million and a 300% rise over 1950 's $300 million trade deficit . The monthly deficit had been reduced to $52 million when Premier Piney left office at the end of last year , but it has grown again to a $70 million monthly rate now . Exports are covering only about 70% of imports fi om other countries ; France 's deficit in the European Payments Union last month amounted to $31 million , all of which had to he paid in gold or dollars because of France 's extreme debtor position in this European trade clearing house . This overspending to buy foreign goods threatens exhaustion of the nation 's gold stocks . These now consist of $570 million held by the Bank of France and about $100 million In currency stabilization funds held by the French Treasury . The country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pre-war figure of $2,700 million  --  mostly by payments to cover past trade deficits which had to be settled in gold or dollars . The French have tried to boost their export earnings by various forms of " disguised " devaluation . These include helping exporters to lower prices by allowing them to sell some of their dollar proceeds at " black market " rates and by refunding some of their taxes . These devices have not proved effective enough , however . More Dollar Aid ? So for several years , the French dollar trade gap has been covered largely by American aid  --  putting off the day when the nation must make internal reforms or go bankrupt . F'or the current U. S fiscal year , France is slated-to receive $525 million in defense and " budget support " aid . not counting dollar earnings from offshore purchases of military equipment by the U. S. and from the spending of G.Ls and tourists . But now the widening of the gap between France a foreign spending end earnings makes essential either an increase in t ' S. aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem ) which is unlike ) ' 1 if the country is not to go , broke and the franc collapse Fiench officials themselves admit most of their foreign trade troubles are due to the effects of domestic inflation on French export prices . The 1953 French budget -- weighted down with the expense of subsidies , welfare programs , the Indo-China war and rearmament  --  calls for spending the franc equivalent of over $10,680 million . Yet the government is only counting on receipts of $8,500 million from taxes , plus about $500 million in U. S. aid . That leaves a budget deficit of nearly $1,700 million ? which must be met largely through the creation of new credit money . The current slowdown of the French economy is both a result and a further cause of the depreciation of the franc . The government 's estimates of 1953 tax revenues assumed nearly 5300 million would result from a 3% expansion of production this year . But French production , after rising 45% above the 1938 level , stopped expanding at the turn of the year  --  and about 300,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather goods , chemical , paper and glassware industries . Much of this slump is the result of falling export sales and consumer resistance at home to high prices ; that is , a result of inflation . Some of it is also regarded by bankers as a reaction following the mild price deflation that did occur under Premier Pinay . Wholesale prices fell 1.7% under Monsieur Pinay  --  causing a squeeze on some inefficient enterprises , and so some reduction in tax revenue . Printing Presses Still Grind What worries French bankers most now is that the government will submit to the political pressure to use a further dose of spending and . inflation to try to pull the country out of this slump . The Mayer government had reduced its 1953 expenditures from the franc equivalent of $10.9 billion by scratching off $220 million in investment credits that were to have gone to nationalized industries and other enterprises . Now two-thirds of these cancelled credits are likely to be restored to the budget , and easier credit facilities have also been promised to farmers and other groups . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may soon resume the past practice of large-scale borrowing from the Bank of France  --  which . in turn , grinds out new money on its printing presses . The premier has already obtained an increase in the limit of direct government borrowing from the bank  --  from the franc equivalent of $500 million to $572 million . He has also recently sold the franc equivalent of $72 million in Treasury bonds to the bank . The Bank of France has already printed so many new banknotes over the past three years that the money supply has been doubled in this period . The two past and present policies of French governments  --  covering the budget deficit by inflationary financing and covering the foreign trade deficit by American aid ? constitute a double menace to the franc 's future Ac one French financial columnist puts It . " France will never have a stable money , and a soh/ base for real prosperity for her people . until she makes some big reforms right here at home . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
