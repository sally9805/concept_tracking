Under Weigh Katherine Anne Porter Drawings by Bernarda Bryson T wo inordinately dressed-up young Cuban women , frankly ladies of trade , had been playing cards together in the bar for an hour before the ship sailed . They sat with crossed legs in rolled-top fine stockings to show their powdered knees . Red-stained cigarettes sagged from their scarlet full mouths , smoke curled towards their narrowed eyes and heavily beaded lashes . The elder was a commanding beauty ; the younger , smaller , thinner , apparently in frail health . She observed the other attentively and played her cards as if she hardly dared to win . The long-legged young Texan , whose name was William Denny , shambled in and sat at a corner of the bar facing them , ordered a mug of beer , and watched them with a wary but knowing eye . The ladies ignored him , and though they paused now and again to sip their pousse-caf  --  s and glance haughtily about the comfortably crowded bar , they never once glanced at Denny , who felt it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , as if calling the bar man , still staring at them , a mean cold little smile starting in his face . Chili queens . He knew their kind . He had not lived all his life in Brownsville , Texas , for nothing . He rapped again , noisily . " You have your beer , sir , " said the bar man . " Anything else , please ? " They glanced at him then , their contemptuous eyes fixed upon him as if he were a wall shutting out their daylight . His gazequivered , his smile vanished ; he dived into his mug of beer , drank , lighted a cigarette , leaned over and examined his own shoes intently , and fumbled for his handkerchief . At last lie broke for the open air , like a man on urgent business . There seemed nowhere to go , though , and nothing much to do , unless he went back to his cabin to finish unpacking a few things and settle down . 0 PENING the door of his cabin , he noticed three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott , read the little card , Herr Wilhelm Denny , and , surprise , Herr Karl Glocken . He looked in upon an already crowded scene . The tight-faced , medium-sized young man whom he had noticed running around Vera Cruz with that bitchy-looking girl in the blue pants was cleaning the wash hand basin with something that smelled like Lysol . There were two strange suitcases , foreign stuff , and a battered Gladstone bag open in Denny 's berth , the lower . At least he had been promised the lower , and lie was going to have it . The young man raised his eyes briefly , said , " Hello , " and went on washing the basin . Seated upon a footstool , Herr Glocken was fumbling among the contents of a clumsy canvas duffle bag . He was the most terribly deformed human being Denny had ever seen . Bending over as he was , his body was so close to the floor his long arms could stretch " Under Weigh " is a second episode from Miss Porter 's novel-in-progress , which Harper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipboard between Vera Cruz and Bremerhaven in 1931 . A third excerpt will appear in the December issue . further than his out-spread legs . He got up with an apologetic air , stood almost four feet tall , with his long sad face cradled in a hunch high as his head . " I 'll be out of here in a minute , " he said in fair English , with a pained smile . He then eased himself down upon the edge of the mattress among the luggage , closed his eyes , and seemed to faint . David Scott and Denny exchanged unwilling looks of understanding ; they were obviously stuck with this fellow , and there was nothing to be done about it that either could see at the moment . " We 'd better call the steward , " said David Scott . Herr Glocken opened his eyes and shook his head , waving one long hand limply . " No , no , " he said , in a dry , deprecating voice , " do n't trouble yourselves . It is nothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long , " said Denny , backing away , " I 'll be in later . " " Here , let me move these , " said David , laying hold of the suitcases . There was no place for them under the berth . Denny 's luggage was already there . The closet was too small to hold them . He put them on the divan bed for the present . Herr Glocken said , " I have no right to this berth , I belong in the upper , but how am I to get there ? " David said , - You take the divan and I 'll take the upper . " " I do n't know how sleep there , it 's so narrow , " said Herr Glocken , and David , measuring the curve of the monstrous back by the width of the couch , looked away from both , and said , " Better stay where you are , then . We 'll change around . " HERE was silence while David looked T for a place to put his toothbrushes . Herr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay on his side , facing the light , knees drawn up almost to chin , near the edge of the bed to make room for the . curved spine . His thin dry hair was rumpled like sun-burned corn silk , the great misshapen face was closed in deathly melancholy . The toes of his shoes turned up and there were patches on the soles . David observed the clutter of small articles belonging to Denny that took up most of the small shelf above the wash basin . " Eatsyeast , " he said innerly , and disgust was added to his deep sense of wrong . He had been assured by the ticket clerk in Mexico there would be only two passengers to a cabin . " Smokes a pipe . And reads improving literature . " He removed from the couch a serious looking cloth-bound book entitled , Recreational Aspects of Sex as Mental Prophylaxis , with a subhead , " A Guide to True Happiness in Life . " " Jesus , " said David . The smell of lysol could not quite down the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Herr Glocken 's shoes , the old moldy smell of the cabin itself . David saw his face in the mirror ; he looked greenish , he felt qualmy , the floor rolled slightly under him , and his gorge heaved spontaneously . He rushed for the door , almost falling over Herr Glocken 's duffle bag , and made for the upper deck . Another outrage : he had been promised a cabin on A Deck , but he was actually on Deck C , with a porthole instead of a window . The warm slow winds were clean and so moist they blew like a soft steam against his face . The deeply slanted afternoon sun cast long shafts of light into the water , dark blue below , clear green fluted with white at the surface . David saw Jenny strolling toward him , the first time he had seen tier since they separated to find their cabins . She had changed from the blue trousers to a white linen dress and white leather sandals , and she was walking with a strange young man , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an old friend . He noted with a pang that the man was good-looking in a detestable way , like a kind of sports clothing advertisement , with a bland , conceited German face . Where had Jenny picked him up , in this short time ? He stopped at the rail and pretended not to see them , then turned casually , he hoped , as they drew near . " Why , hello , " said Jenny absent-mindedly , with a vague air of imperfect recognition . " How are you ? " and they moved on without pausing . Her wide light hazel eyes had the look of blind diffused excitement he knew well . She was probably talking already about the most personal things , telling her thoughts or asking questions designed to lead the man to talk about himself . David watched her small , neat figure , the round head with the black knot of hair , the rather stiff , modestwalk , which managed to conceal or misrepresent everything he thought he had learned about Jenny . She had rather the look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly that she must carry herself smoothly and hold her shoulders straight . David looked at his watch , decided it was time for the first drink of the day , the hour toward which he lived of late , and went in the bar , feeling all at once surrounded and smothered by the sea , which he hated , and which now filled him with a quiet , deep horror . There was no place , no place at all to go . This whole wild escapade to Europe was Jenny 's idea , he had never wanted to leave Mexico , but had let her lead him by the nose , as usual . Still , not altogether , he reflected , when the first slug of whiskey had begun to take hold . She had wanted to go first to France , he had been determined , if he went anywhere , to go to Spain . They had compromised on Germany , which neither of them cared to see . That is , they had drawn one from three straws , and the shortest had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jenny had come in one afternoon announcing gayly that in case they changed their minds , they could still get visas for France from the French consul in Vigo . The German ship 's agent at Norddeutscher Lloyd 's had assured her this was possible . Well , she might go to France if she liked . He was going to Spain . She should see whether he would have it all her own way . 44T7 1TTE , " said Mrs. Treadwell timidly , thinking she might as well begin brushing up on her Berman , to the round small woman with glossy braids who was having tea at a table by herself . Opposite her was the only empty chair . The bar was crowded , it looked cheerful enough , but the silence was rather disconcerting . Even those persons who were obviously related in some way sat mute as strangers . An amiable but empty little smile spread itself over the plump fresh face with its soft features . A competent white hand was lifted , palm out , gently . " No , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak English for years now . I taught English . even  --  do sit down , please  --  in the German school in Guadalajara . My husband taught there also . But mathematics . " " Tea , please , " said Mrs. Treadwell to the steward . She had changed from dark blue linen to pale gray linen , with still shorter sleeves , and the disgraceful looking big blotch on her arm where the beggar woman in Vera Cruz had pinched her , was turning livid . " I am Frau Otto Schmidt , " said the round woman , stirring her tea and dropping more sugar in it . " I was from Nurnberg in my youth and I am returning there at last . It was to have been my great happiness , my husband 's long-looked-for joy , but now it is only grief and disappointment . " She spoke in a low voice without complaint , as if she wished any chance acquaintance to identify her at once with her grief as the only fact of any importance to be known about her . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought with a painful twinge of surprise , " Even here . How inevitable . I shall spend this voyage listening to some one 's sorrows , I shall sit down and have a good cry with somebody no doubt before this trip is over . This is a fine be-ginning . " " Where are you going ? " asked Frau Schmidt , after a small pause in which the expected question leading up to the story of her disappointment had not been asked . " To Paris , " said Mrs. Treadwell . " Back to Paris . " " All , you were only visiting in Mexico ? " " Yes . " " You have friends there ? " " No . " Frau Schmidt 's blue gaze transferred itself to Mrs. Treadwell 's arm . " You have bruised yourself badly , " she observed , with mild in- ' terest . Mrs. Treadwell said , " The astonishing fact is , a beggar pinched inc . " " Why ? " " Because I would not give her an alms , " said Mrs. Treadwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid that refusal might sound , just told flatly . " Naturally I do n't expect any one to believe it . " She selected a thin dry wafer . " Why not ? " asked Frau Schmidt , childishly . " Well , anything can happen , I know that , " said Mrs. Treadwell , " but I always find myself thinking , not to me . " Now why had she said that ? She observed at the same moment , on the other side of the bar , that the Ameri-can girl Jenny Brown was already seated with the only presentable looking man on the boat . " Anything can happen to any of us at any time , " said Frau Schmidt with easy certainty . " My husband  --  how long have we hoped to return to Niirnburg together ? But now I go alone , and for good . My husband died six weeks and two days ago today , at eight minutes after seven this morning .. . . " It would have to be death , thought Mrs. Treadwell , for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing else could touch her , I feel certain . Still , " That is a very terrible thing , " she said , sincerely . Frau Schmidt 's soft mouth drooped at the corners at the first breath of sympathy . She stirred her tea in silence , her lids turned pink , she was quite pacified and alone all at once . Mrs. Tread-well , leaving half her tea , quietly made her escape . 0 N HER way to her cabin she spoke and smiled , in the same tone and with the same smile for each , to the ship 's doctor , noting his fine old saber scar ; to the taffy-haired young officer whose rank she did not know and would never trouble to learn ; to an earnest , stiffly corseted stewardess ; and to a browbeaten little cabin boy who stared back with offended eyes . She noted the name below hers on the door panel , Fraulein Lizzi SpOckenkieker and wondered rather lightly which of the numerous unpromising females on board she might be . Presently as she was arranging her things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multicolored tissue paper over perishable looking wear , shaking pleated silks , and ' setting gold and silver and satin slippers in a row , she smiled again into the garments and said " Griiss Gott " without turning when she heard some one come in . It was the tall girl with the shrill voice . Mrs. Treadwell had a thin tremor of nerves all over , a slight cold shudder from head to foot . She smiled even more amiably , unseen , and became very absorbed in her occupation . After a brief whirl about the room , with scattered cries and giggles , during which a cloud of musky cologne water settled upon the thick air , Fraulein SpOckenkieker took herself away , leaving the door open . Mrs. Treadwell closed it , to shut out the sound of voices in the cabin opening off hers at an angle , where the name plate read , " Baumgartner . " The woman Baumgartner was scolding vigorously a complaining , weak-voiced little boy . Ah , family life , good wholesome German family life , thought Mrs. Treadwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treadwell put her head Out of the porthole and breathed deeply . M 1L OTHER , " said Hans again , as soon as he dared , sitting on the edge of the bed trying to keep out of hei way , " Mother , may I take off my clothes ? " Frau Baumgartner closed both hands into hard fists and shook them above her head . " Have I not told you , " she said , in fresh exasperation , " that you can not take off your clothes until I give you something else to put on . And / have not time now . Do n't ask me again . " The tortured child in his prison of stitched embroidered leather , a Mexican riding dress meant for the cold mountain country , writhed with the itching of heat rash and salt sweat . " You may keep on what you 've got until I open your luggage , " she told him stubbornly , going on with her unpacking of her husband 's things . " I have everything to do as you see and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosed her wrath upon him . " Be silent , or I 'll punish you ! " She raised a flat threatening hand . MAGAZINE He collapsed , sobbing , streaming , there were dark wet streaks in the wrinkles of his buckskin trousers . " I 'm dying , " he told her , in a weak voice , his freckles looking like tiny spots of iodine on his pale skin . " Dying , " said his mother contemptuously , " a big boy like you talking such nonsense . Wait till your father sees you like this . " She rummaged , orderly even in her haste and discomfort , through the layers of folded garments , stopping to push her damp hair off her forehead . She was pale too , flabby and wet down the spine and in the armpits ; she could feel the sweat running down her legs ; her arms shone wetly through the thin dark stuff of her dress . " I suppose you think your mother is not tired and suffering too ? Dci you think you are the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , get up from there and stop sniveling and help me with these things . " " May n't I just take off my jacket ? " he persisted hopelessly , wiping his nose on the back of his hand , weeping again in spite of himself . " So  --  take it off , then , " she said . " I see you are a baby and I shall give you a bottle to nurse , a bottle with a rubber nipple , with milk and sugar , and you shall have nothing else for your supper , " she went on , beginning to enjoy her cruelty , the pleasant feeling that she could hurt his pride even if lie had triumphed in the matter of the jacket . He stripped it off instantly , the air from the porthole blew upon him , and goose flesh rose all over him deliciously . His face cleared , he gave a deep sigh of bliss . ? " Wait till I tell your father how you worry me  --  and if I see you being a cry-baby again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited timidly in the corner at the head of the bed , yearning for kindness , hoping his beautiful good mother would come back . She vanished in this frowning scolding stranger , who blazed out at him when he least expected it , struck him on the hands , seemed to hate him . His head drooped , his hands hung beside him , he gazed from under his scanty light brows , not afraid , but timid , waiting . She got up , pulled her skirts straight , saw him , and was filled with pity and remorse . " Well , my little one , my Hans , " she said tenderly , and kissing her forefinger she laid UNDER it gently on his forehead . " Now , wash your face and hands , wash well , and put on your knit jumper and shorts and we will go and have some cold raspberry juice . But hurry . I will wait outside . " As if she had never been cross , she gave him a most loving smile . In the confusion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold water on his face washed away his tears . F RAU Rittersdorf , on Deck A , took advantage of the absence of her cabin mate to establish her prior rights and privileges as to space and choice of bed . Her ticket specified the upper berth . but Frau Rittersdorf had taken a good look at little Frau Otto Schmidt , and saw at once that the situation would be easy to control . She sent for vases , and set out carefully the two enormous bouquets she had sent herself , one of pale roses , one of gardenias , bought in Vera Cruz , wrapped in wet cotton , and carrying cards attached by silver gauze ribbons : " To my dearest Nannerl , from her faithful Johann . " " To the gniidige Frau Geheimrat Rittersdorf , with respectful greetings . Karl von Ettler . " They looked well , it was not really a deception , as those interesting friends would have been happy to send her flowers on this as on many another occasion except for the lamentable circumstance that they were both dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . God remember them both . She crossed herself , though she was a Lutheran . It was a gesture she felt becoming to her . She set out two silver-topped cut-crystal bottles of perfume , " Garden of Araby " and " Souvenir d'Amour , " and fastened a quilted silk contrivance for containing her silver-backed brush , comb , mirror , nail file , and shoehorn on the right-hand side of the wash basin , the most convenient spot . She did her hair well , and dressed slowly . She had come on board early to avoid the nuisance of mingling with the crowd which she noticed seemed rather inferior in tone . Taking her mirror , she regarded her profile with approval . She had always been called a beauty and she deserved it . She was beautiful still , say what you like . Sitting a moment , she opened a large note book of red and gilt Florentine stamped leather which had a gold pencil attached and began to write : " So in a way , let me confess , this adventure has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the worse . Indeed I may yet see the all-guiding Will of my race in it . A German woman should not marry into a dark race , even if the candidate is of high Spanish blood , of the ruling caste , and of sufficient wealth . . . There are those fatal centuries in Spain when all too insidiously Jewish and Moorish blood may have crept in ? who knows ? That I entertained the notion for a moment is no doubt a weakness of which I should be ashamed . Yet , surrounded as I was by foreign influences , soft persuasions of friends , good Germans whose counsels I respected , alone as I am in the world and somewhat reduced in means , perhaps I should not be too severely censured . . . . After all , I am woman , I need the firm but tender guidance of a husband , whose authority will sustain me , whose principles shall be my -- - Frau Rittersdorf paused . Inspiration had ceased , the next word would not come . She closed her eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its air of remote distinction , hair graying slightly at the temples , around him the aura of Spanish wealth and Spanish pride , based soundly on a large Mexican brewery , rose to plague her . Why had it seemed so likely at one time that he would ask her hand in marriage ? Her cousins in Mexico City , also brewers , had believed that he would ; her dear friend Herr Stumpfen the Consul had been certain of it ; she herself had once almost hoped .. . . She clenched her teeth slightly , closing the book . The dinner bugle sounded with a fine martial tone as if calling heroes to the battlefield . Frau Rittersclorf rose instantly , a girlish eager light in her eyes . She would of course be seated at the Captain 's table . A 44 H my God , there goes the bugle , we shall be late , " said Frau Professor Hutten to her husband , but she continued to hold a bath towel under Bebe 's chin . Herr Professor Mitten with torn newspapers was wiping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BO:4 his big white bull-dog face the very picture of humiliation , rolled his eyes and heaved again into the towel . " My God , my God , " said Frau Hutten in despair , " seasick already , what shall we do ? " " He was seasick before , when we went to Yucatan , nearly all the way , if you remember , " said the Professor , rolling up the soiled newspaper in clean newspaper , standing there in majestic benevolence as if he were getting ready to address his classes . " We need not look for any great change in his organic constitution as time goes on . As a puppy , you remember , he was easily upset , he could not keep his bottle down if he was in the least agitated , and so he is now , and so , " concluded the Professor , " no doubt he will continue to the end . " His wife 's distress was increased if anything by this prospect . " Rut how can I leave him in this condition ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid mound of flesh , Bebe was sprawled beside her , and they were both equally helpless . " I can not get up until you come back either , " she reminded him , " my knee ? " " You are in no circumstances to forego your dinner , " the Professor told her firmly . " I will take your place at his side , and you are to have your food , which otherwise you will miss greatly . " " But my dear , you will starve , think of that , " said Frau Hutten , gazing up at him gratefully . " A small matter , " said her husband . " In fact , I shall not starve in the least . One does not starve for missing only a meal , dear Kathe . In fact it is possible to go without nourishment for forty days ; we have scientific confirmation of the word of Holy Writ . More especially I dare say if one has flesh to spare , plenty of water , and perhaps a little stimulant of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will be necessary . At the worst , you may have them send me a little something on a tray . Better , if we should fold a towel under Bebe 's head , with plenty of newspapers underneath , he will do very well by himself for , let us say , an hour . " Frau Hutten nodded . She lifted Bebe 's head and examined him . He seemed more at ease . " Do n't think your little Papa and Mama are deserting you , my precious one , " she told him , in deep maternal tones . " We are only going for a little while . " The Professor hooked both his arms under her armpits , from the back , and hauled her up expertly , steadied her while she regained herbalance , after which she could walk almost without a limp . He then carried out his own proposed measures for the care of Bebe , who appeared very little interested in them or in his surroundings . " Ah , " sighed Frau Hutten , " it is all very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the Professor reassuringly . Bebe was going to be a problem , though , if not a nuisance , as always , he could see . A hard thought , for which the Professor rebuked himself secretly . " Away with us before the soup is cold , " he exclaimed , with the false gaiety of a guilty conscience . T HE dining room was clean and well polished . There were flowers on the tables and an adequate display of fresh white napery . The waiters seemed refreshed and stimulated by the beginning of another voyage , and the famished faces of the new set of passengers wore a mollified , expectant air . The Captain was absent , but at his table Dr. Sacher greeted the guests and explained to them that it was the Captain 's custom to dine on the bridge during the serious first hours of voyage . They all nodded in generous agreement and acknowledgement of the Captain 's heavy task of getting them safely to sea , and all was sedate remark and easy understanding among the chosen ones : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lizzi SpOckenkieker , Frau Rittersdorf , Frau Otto Schmidt , and the presentable young man whom Mrs. Treadwell had noticed with Jenny Brown . His name was Wilhelm Freytag , he said several times over in the round of exchange of names when the company had sat down . Within three minutes Frau Rittersdorf had ascertained that he was " connected " with a German oil company in Mexico City , was married , a pity rather , and was even then in that moment on his way to Mannheim to bring back his young wife and her mother . Frau Rittersdorf also decided almost instantly that Herr Rieber bounced and chuckled rather vulgarly and was hardly up to the rest of the Captain 's guests . Frau Schmidt and the Huttens were at once amiably disposed toward each other when it came out they were all teachers in German schools , the Huttens in Mexico City . Herr Rieber , in top spirits , twinkling roguishly at Lizzi , but decently subdued by the society in which he found himself , proposed by way of a good beginning that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received with the best of good will by the others . The wine was brought , real Niersteiner Domtal of a good year , so hard to find in Mexico , so expensive when found , so missed by them all , so loved , the beautiful good sound white wine of Germany , fresh as flowers . They sniffed their chilled goblets , their eyes moistened and beamed upon each other . They touched brims lightly , clinking all about , spoke the kind round words of health and good fortune to each other , and drank . Nothing , they felt , could have been more amiable , more correct , more charming , than that moment . They fell upon their splendid full-bodied German food with hot appetites . They were all going home , home at last , and in this ship they had in common for the first time the feeling that they had already set foot upon a mystic fatherland . Restored , fortified , they paused now and again to wipe their teeming mouths , nodding at each other in silence . Dr. Sadler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly remember when he had been hungry . The guests gave him admiring glances as they ate and drank . The highest kind of German good-breeding , they could see , with the dignity of his humane profession adding still more luster ; and his fine scar , showing that he had gone to a great university , that he was brave and cool-headed . If lie seemed a little absent , silent , that was his right , it belonged to the importance of his duties as ship 's physician . GG ICS knuckles , David Darling , " said Jenny Brown , after a morsel , restoring his private particular name to David Scott for the first time in three days . His own mood was not so easy  --  he reflected that she probably would not become Jenny Angel to him again for several days more . " I 'm boning up on German from the water taps and all the little signs about , but I find almost all the people speak English or French or both . Do you see that young man I was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one with the resolute-looking haircut . I did n't even know he was German until he told me . I wanted then to practice my German on him , but after the first sentence he could n't bear it , plainly , and I must say , he speaks English-English , which I can not claim . Awfully English  --  I thought perhaps he had lived in England , but no , he learned it in school in Berlin . . .. Well , my Swiss girl . Did I tell you I have that big Swiss girl in my cabin ? She wears a white linen corset cover with tatting around the edges , and a jumbo corset with real whalebone in it : I 'll bet you never saw one .... She speaks Spanish and French and English and the dialect of her native province in Switzerland which she calls Roman , or Romanche , besides German , and she 's barely eighteen . But she will only speak English to me , though I certainly do as well at French as she does . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the way it is going to be . " " If you live in foreign countries you try to pick up whatever language you need , " said David . " We do the same . Look at me , even learning Russian . " " Yes , look at you , " said Jenny admiringly , even learning the grammar , from the book , a thing that would never occur to me . I ca n't learn grammar , that 's flat , but I do n't feel the need of it . " " If you could hear yourself sometimes , " said David , " you 'd feel the need . You say some really appalling things , in Spanish I mean . " " You look pretty as a picture in that blue shirt , darling , " said Jenny . " I hope that does n't appall you .... My God , I am starving . Was n't Vera Cruz deadly this time ? What came over that town ? I had the tenderest memories of the place , and now I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual to me , " said David . " Ah , not to me , " said Jenny . " I used to walk about there at night , after a rain , with everything washed clean , when the sweet-bynight and the jasmine were in full bloom and the colors of the plaster walls very pure . I would come on those little unexpected squares and corners and fountains , all of them composed just waiting to be painted , and none of them looking as they did in daylight . All the windows would be open and pale yellow light streaming out , with clouds of white mosquito netting over the big beds and half-dressed , half-asleep people moving about already in a dream , or sitting out on the little balconies just for the pleasure of breathing . It was beautiful and I loved it . The people were so friendly and good  --  everybody . And once there was a terrible glorious thunderstorm , and lightning hit the elevator shaft in my hotel about twenty feet from my room and almost knocked me out . I loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . " David protested this memory coldly , doubtfully . " You never told me that before , " he said . " I hope not , " she said . " Would n't that be dull ? But you never believe any memory that is pleasant , I wonder why ? You must let me remember it in rty own way , as beautiful at least once . " After a light pause she added , " I am sure that if you had been there it would all have looked very different . " She watched with clinical attention his smooth , tight-skinned face that gave absolutely no sign when he was hit . " Who was with you , then , that it was all so delightful ? " " Nobody , " she said softly . " I was there by myself and I saw it in my own way with no one to spoil it for me . " " And no boat to catch . " " No , I came off the boat from New York . Nine lovely days when I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my waiter and my stewardess . " " They must have been flattered , " said David Darling meanly . But it gave him no satisfaction . Jenny straightened her knife and fork and took a sip of water . " I do n't know , " she told him gravely as if she were considering deeplyan important question , " I really do n't know whether I am going to be able to sit at this table with you the whole voyage or not . At least I am glad we have separate cabins . " " I am too , " said David instantly , a cold fire in his eyes . They both fell silent then , with guarded faces , knowing by then there was no end to it , the quarrel between them was a terrible treadmill that they mounted together and tramped round and round until they were wearied out or in despair . And so senseless , always about nothing ; they both knew it . He went on doggedly with his food , she took up her fork again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last . " How does it begin ? Why ? I never know . " D AVM knew that her yielding was half fatigue , half boredom , but he was grateful for the reprieve . Besides , she had got in a good blow at him , and must feel easier . He did not forgive her , he would take her by surprise some day in turn , and watch her face turn pale ; she always recognized revenge for what it was , yet admitted its barbarous justice . At least she did n't expect to be allowed to get away with murder , and he would make it his business to see that she did not . He smiled at her with real sweetness , reached out and laid his hand over hers warmly . " jenny Angel , " he said , and instantly she felt her heart  --  she believed firmly that her heart could feel  --  melting just a little . She said , " You old thing , you  --  let 's try to be happy . Let 's not spoil our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Darling , I promise  --  Iet 's try ? " Mysteriously she seemed on the verge of tears .
