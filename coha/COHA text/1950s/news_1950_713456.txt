txt The first American expedition to Mount Everest has returned to New Delhi after a pioneering investigation into the mysteries of the earth 's highest peak that will be a future source of material to mountaineers everywhere . Everest 's precipitous icy spire , reaching 29 , - 141 feet , is one of the world 's most ! dramatic challenges to man 's mas tery of nature . Oscar R. Houston of New York was the leader of the group of climbers , members of which have tried to overcome great peaks in many parts of the World . The others were his son , Dr. Charles Houston of Exeter , N. H. , who has climbed Nanda Devi , 25,645-foot peak in In= dia and until this summer the highest peak ever scaled by man afoot ; Maj. H. W. Tilman , British veteran of two Everest expeditions , who is credited with defeating more major summits than any other man ; Mrs. E. S. Cowles of Colorado Springs , Col. , one of America 's most famous roman alpinists , and Anderson TRUMBULL LW YORK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at St. Mary 's College , 1 Kurseong , West Bengal . Dr. Houston and Major Tilman alone made the first reconnaissance of the great mountain 's south face . They climbed to a point between 18,000 and 19,000 feet up to determine the feasibility of attempting to conquer Everest 's untouched summit from this side , which lies in Nepal . All previous expeditions have been made by way of the north face in Tibet , and the south side until now has been unexplored . The Houston expedition was not trying to reach Everest 's crest this time . The scouting of the south slope , however , was an important contribution to Everest lore and to the knowledge of one of the most inaccessible regions on earth , which white men had never explored before . Their report , first given for publication to tins correspondent to- day , was not encouraging . One gathered that only their scientific caution prevented their making a flat statement that to reach Everest 's icy top from the south Nivas impossible . " Our conclusions about the south face , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were that it presented much greater climbing difficulties than the north side . The southern face is precipitous and broken by long and intricate ridges , which would be technically difficult and dangerous . The south face may well be impossible and we could see no practicable climbing route . " Until the Houston expedition , Mount Everest has been a British monopoly , with the exception of one New Zealander , L. V. Bryant , in 1935 . Few parties have been able to obtain permission from the Government of Tibet to make the trek to the foot of the unconquered peak . ? The Houstons chose the southern experiment for four important ad-vantages : 1 . The route lay through the friendly and accessible country of Nepal , whose ruler sanctioned the American expedition . 2 . The approach to the mountain is short and relatively easy , taking two weeks from India instead of six through Tibet . 3 . The rock formation of the southern face was expected to be more favorable because of a gentler slope of strata and a formation resembling gigantic stairs , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north face is in the shadow most of the time , whereas on the south side all climbing can be done in sunshine that reduces the hazard of extreme cold . Take Numerous Photographs While other members of the party remained at a Buddhist monastery 13,000 feet high on the approaches to Everest , Charles Houston and Major Tilman'set out Nov. 15 to examine the hitherto untried south slope with three Sherpa porters to move their camp from stage to stage . On the second day , Dr. Houston and Major Tilman went to 17,000 feet on the face of the Nuptse ridge . The following day they climbed to 17,000 by a different route and on the third day they moved to Pumo RI , , on the opposite side of the valley , and went to between 18,000 and 19,000 feet to observe the south face of Everest from that vantage point . They took numerous photographs , which , when developed , will add to the none-too-plentiful knowledge of Everest and throw the first light on a part of the world never seen by white ' men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of the south foot of Mount Everest before . Dr. Houston said . Find Animal Life Dr. Houston and Major Tilman took their observations in temperatures that reached 10 degrees Fahrenheit at night and were never above freezing in sunlight . They found tracks and other indications of abundant animal life on this unmapped slope , including birds , mice , rabbits , snow leopards and many small insects . Dr. Houston said glaciation suggested that the south slope of Everest had much less precipitation than the north side . Nowhere did the snow show signs of melting . Glaciers themselves  --  including two major glaciers that di ' not show ? on any map  --  he discovered to be dying rapidly . " They are black , dirty , rottenlooking and entirely stagpant , " he said . Except in cracks on the majestic mountain 's rugged face , there was . no snow until 19,000 feet , Dr. Houston said , although from the . unattained summit the wind blew powdery snow in a plume that stretched fifty miles like a pennant of unimaginable size . The party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold snow and there was little on the south side of the topmost cone . Mount Everest really asserted her majesty at sundown , when seen from the monastery where the other members ? of the party waited . As the sun went behind immense ridges early and left other great peaks in darkness , Everest continued to stand out in a glorious blaze of light , with its immense snow plume sparkling like a crystal mist . The party 's stay at the Thyangboche Monastery , where they were guests of a 16-year-old reincarnated Buddha , was unique in that an American woman , Mrs. Cowles , 1was permitted to witness Lamaistic rites for the first time . What intrigued the mountaineering party almost more than even some of the breathtaking sights they saw was a sign over the entrance to the public school ? at Dhankuta , a town two day 's trek inside the border of most remote Nepal . Inscribed by an unknown hand , it said in ' English , " Gather courage  --  do n't be a chickenhearted fellow . " The party took this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
