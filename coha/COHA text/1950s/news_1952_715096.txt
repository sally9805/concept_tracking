txt Industry Educates Its Engineers Two Pittsburgh industries and the University of Pittsburgh have worked , out a plan to tap a hitherto undeveloped source of badly needed engineering personnel . The plan is based on two widely recognized facts : ( 1 ) Industries are finding it difficult to obtain a sufficient number of engineers to fill their needs . ( 2 ) Every year numbers of high school graduates who are fully qualified to begin engineering training must go to work , unable to continue their formal education . Dean G. R. Fitterer of the University of Pittsburgh School of Engineering consulted with officials of a number of Pittsburgh industries which are already cooperating with the university in a program of graduate work . The objective was to work out a similar program which would provide undergraduate engineering training for qualified employes . Employes in School Here is the way the program works : Dean Fitterer has rearranged the regular engineering curriculum leading to the bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering or i n mechanical engineering so that it is now offered in two parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include the technical core of the regular engineering curriculum . These are presented first so that the employe-student may get the courses which will most immediately help him in his career and provide for earliest upgrading into engineering positions . This part of the , curriculum can be completed in four years , In the second part , the employe-student will take those social , science and humanities background courses which will complete his requirements for the bachelor of science degree . Students applying for the **30;1180;TOOLONG program must be high school graduates and must be able to satisfy all the entrance requirements which are met by any other entering student . They will continue to carry their regular work load and maintain their income and take courses on their own time , for the most part in the evening hours . Company Pays Tuition Tuition will be paid by the employing company under an arrangement which encourages completion of each part of the curriculum . As the employe-student completes each course with a grade of C or better , the company will reimburse him for one-half of the tuition cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum , the university will so certify to the company and the company will then reimburse him for the remainder of the tuition cost for all courses completed . Similar reimbursment will be arranged as the employe-student progresses through the second part of the curriculum . It is estimated that it will cost the company $2,200 for each student who completes the bachelor of science program in engineering . An initial group of 150 young men has already begun work under the program . They are employes of Westinghouse Electric Corporation and of the Union Switch and Sigrial Division of Westinghouse Airbrake Corporation . The average age is 24 years , but ages range from 17 to 39 years . Although the plan has been inaugurated with but two companies , more concerns are expected to participate later . College officials hope that by this scholarship plan many students who might otherwise be unable to afford a college education will be enabled to complete their work for the engineeing degree . With a severe shortage of engineering personnel facing this country , this university-business project appears to be an important educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
