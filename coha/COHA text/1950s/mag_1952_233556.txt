The delicate art of Japanese lantern-making , in which the ladies opposite are engaged , owes its worldwide popularity to Emperor Hirohito 's grandfather . In 1878 , the artisan city of Gifu presented Emperor Meiji with a particularly beautiful lantern ; he was so deeply moved that he resolved to encourage the trade , and by the turn of the century lanterns had become one of Japan 's most famed exports . <P> The lanterns that shone in the dim dawn of Japanese history were globefish-gutted , puffed , dried , and filled with live fireflies . The lanterns that pleased Hirohito 's grandfather , and have been a delight ever since , are more complex . They are designed to transform candlelight into globes of muted color . Each one requires up to 120 bamboo strips , no thicker than toothpicks , which are bound together with silk threads to make a collapsible frame . The frame is covered with eight sections of silk or oiled paper , painted with traditional figures . Gluing the shell to the frame is the hardest part of the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humidity are just right . One skilled artisan , working fast , can produce two fine silk lanterns in a day . <P> The Japanese use their lanterns for funeral processions , nighttime strolls , and advertising displays . Abroad , their soft colored light turns many a garden party into a festival .
