Welcome nowhere in the Western Hemisphere , ousted Cuban Dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar chartered a plane in the Dominican Republic one day last week and droned off to exile on the faraway Portuguese island of Madeira , a land full of terraced vineyards and empty of revolutionary ferment . " Too bad . " grumped Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro , who would like to shoot Batista as a war criminal . " Batista 's departure . " said U.S. State Department Press Officer Lincoln White , " will contribute to the efforts of the entire American community of nations to restore calm to the Caribbean . " <P> Batista itched to get out of the Dominican Republic almost from the day he hit there last January . A subdued and indifferent man desiring only to enjoy the $40 million plus that he stole from Cuba , Batista instead found himself sucked into anti-Castro plots by Dominican Dictator Rafael Trujillo . A Cuban general named Jose Eleuterio Pedraza ( who urged Batista to stay in Cuba and fight instead of fleeing ) became Trujillo 's favorite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batista dragged his feet , he came in for scathing attacks in Trujillo 's press ( BATISTA SHOULD GET OUT ) . <P> Batista kept hoping against hope for permanent residence in Daytona Beach , Fla. , where he has a wife and five children , a $100,000 mansion and extensive investments in real estate . Batista 's 11-year-old son sent a telegram to President Eisenhower , and Batista 's wife followed through with a tearful letter to Mamie : " In the moment of my sadness , shall I have you to help me ? Dear lady , do your best . " But , according to Batista 's Washington lawyers , the best that the State Department offered was to " help get Batista anywhere else , if it could avoid the embarrassment it felt would arise if he came to the U.S. " Accordingly , when the State Department declared last week that Batista 's application for a U.S. visa was a " dead issue , " his Portuguese visa was ready and waiting . <P> " In granting asylum to ex-President Batista in the quiet and isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has been moved solely by its earnest desire to assist the parties more directly concerned to maintain peace in a vital area of the world . " At the Lisbon airport , cops threw a protective ring around Batista 's 15-man party , sped it off to a gold-and-blue suite at the just-opened Ritz Hotel . " I am out of politics , " Batista told the few newsmen admitted to his rooms . " Cubans deserve their own decisions . They chose not to have me as President . " He planned to sail in a few days for Madeira , a haunt for retired Britons . 400 miles west of the Moroccan coast , which has no airstrip , and is rarely visited by tourists .
