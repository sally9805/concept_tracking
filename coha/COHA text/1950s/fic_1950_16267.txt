FADE IN : EXT LONG SHOT CITY STREET IN A POOR NEIGHBORHOOD NIGHT in a vast , sprawling midwestern city . Far down the street , almost at the end of the vista , a police car cruising at ten miles per hour creeps slowly toward the CAMERA . The occupants are not yet visible , but we are aware of voices distorted through a radio speaker , official voices often overlapping , in which pieces of words and numbers are sometimes distinguishable . The car continues to move , keeping close to the curb . The asphalt road , the cement sidewalks , the dark store windows and brick sides of the four-or five-story tenements , are now all the same color and texture : wet , black , and shiny  --  for a fine rain has been falling all day and all evening . Still moving slowly and steadily toward the CAMERA , its radio a little louder , though not any clearer , is the police prowl car . It is close enough now to see two officers in the front seat . MEDIUM TRUCKING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dark store fronts swing around , the corner is slowly turned , the new vista is spotted now with the neon invitations of a dozen bars . As they drive slowly by , the music  --  rhumba and hillbilly  --  drowns out for a moment the official voices of the police radio . MEDIUM SHOT CITY STREET PANNING with the police car as it comes to the end of the block and enters a short vehicular tunnel , an archway lined with porcelain brick . MEDIUM TRUCKING SHOT INSIDE VEHICULAR TUNNEL ANGLE AS IF FROM THE POLICE CAR An elderly man with a stooped walk is approached and overtaken  --  3  --  by another much younger and better-dressed man . He walks alongside him and there is an urgent , whispered offer  --  it is impossible to tell of what  --  but the elderly man shakes his head . The younger man abandons his customer and turning his face away from the invisible , slowly moving police car , scratches a light on the porcelain brick .

Most are shut and dark , but in one there is the shadow of a couple , the man a little drunk and trying his fist on the smudged glass of the door , the woman raising both hands to restrain him . More silent houses , then , a little farther along , a door is flung open and a young woman bursts out into the street . One shoe is broken and torn . She has no hat , and she is crying , as much out of anger as anything else . Her face comes quite close by the CAMERA , and she pulls at the white satin scarf around her neck as if it were choking her .

MEDIUM TRUCKING SHOT ANGLE AS IF FROM THE POLICE CAR PAST A CEMENT PARAPET AND TOWARD THE RIVER The sleek , oily black surface , rippled by the wind , carries along something yellowish white and indistinguishable . The object floats closer and downstream into the reflection of light from the bridge . It 's clear for a moment before it passes back into the shadow  --  it 's only a crate from the long wholesale piers at the edge of the city .

Doll sits down quickly  --  afraid he 'll change his mind . &nbsp; DOLLDo n't care if I do . She laughs as if she did n't have a care in the world . He pours her a drink . &nbsp; DIX ( looking at overnight bag ) Were you locked out of your room ? &nbsp; DOLLHow did you guess ? Dix indicates her overnight bag . She laughs . &nbsp; DOLL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye ! ( then nervously ) Dix , honey , if it wo n't bother you too much , could I stay here a couple a days ? Just a day or two . Dix picks up a Racing Form , and begins studying it . Doll watches him . She thinks she has been refused . She puts her drink down and looks away from him .  --  26  --  &nbsp; DIX ( finally ) All right , stay if you want to  --  but do n't you go getting any ideas , Doll . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details INT CARD ROOM EMMERICH 'S COUNTRY HOUSE NIGHT A cheerful fire is burning in the fireplace . Doc is holding up an envelope for Emmerich to see . The latter is a big man in his fifties , with broad shoulders and a deep chest . He is wearing a well-tailored dinner jacket . He looks , talks , and breathes affluence . Cobby sits beaming at whoever happens to be speaking . The inevitable drink is in his hand . &nbsp; DOCEverything is here  --  from the observed routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of locks on the doors , and the age and condition of the main safe . Take my word for it , Mr. Emmerich , this is a ripe plum ready to fall . &nbsp; EMMERICHMy friend , according to the boys all takes are easy , but I 've made a lot of money getting them out of jail . &nbsp; DOCPlease , Mr. Emmerich . Perhaps you know my reputation . I 've engineered some very big things . &nbsp; COBBYThat 's a fact , Mr. Emmerich . Doc here is tops . &nbsp; EMMERICH ( pointing to envelope in Doc 's hand ) Am I to understand that you gathered all that information before your last stretch ? &nbsp; DOC ( nods ) That is correct . I was ready to begin operations when the coppers grabbed me for a caper I 'd almost forgotten about . &nbsp; COBBYThe Adelphia Finance caper . Took them for **30;1395;TOOLONG . . . Did n't you , Doc ?  --  27  --  &nbsp; DOCSeventy . &nbsp; EMMERICHDo you really believe there 's a half million in this thing ? &nbsp; DOCMaybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worth half a million to us in actual cash , because in no case would a fence give us more than fifty percent ? &nbsp; DOCThat 's right , sir . &nbsp; EMMERICHWhat are the main problems ? &nbsp; DOCThere are three : money to operate  --  personnel  --  and the final disposal of the take . &nbsp; COBBYNo trouble about the first , eh , Mr. Emmerich ? &nbsp; EMMERICHThat remains to be seen . &nbsp; DOCThe helpers will be paid off like house painters . They will be told nothing about the size of the take . Sometimes men get greedy . ( he chuckles good-naturedly ) &nbsp; EMMERICHHow many helpers do you need ? &nbsp; DOCOnly three . A box man  --  him we pay most  --  maybe twenty-five thousand dollars . &nbsp; COBBYI got a guy for you  --  Louis Ciavelli  --  best peter man west of Chicago . Expert mechanic  --  been on some very big capers . The way I hear  --  he can open a safe like the back of a watch . Only he costs .  --  28  --  &nbsp; DOCThen we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He should get ten thousand . Emmerich nods . &nbsp; DOCAnd finally  --  sad to say  --  we need a hooligan . Most of these fellows are drug addicts . They 're a no-good lot or they would n't be hooligans . Violence is all they know . But they are , unfortunately , necessary . For a more or less reliable man , I 'd say  --  fifteen thousand . &nbsp; EMMERICHThat 's fifty thousand in all . Doc nods . Emmerich throws his cigar in the fireplace , and taking out his handkerchief , rubs his palms . &nbsp; EMMERICHHow 's the take to be handled ? &nbsp; DOCWe shall get in touch with the best fences in the Midwest , and deal with the highest offer . Maybe no one fence can handle the whole thing  --  in that case , we deal with two or three . Emmerich rises and walks back and forth across the room . &nbsp; EMMERICH ( taking a deep breath ) Perhaps I . . . I 'm just thinking . . . I mean , if I decide to come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobby and Doc stare at the lawyer in astonishment . &nbsp; COBBYYou  --  a fence , Mr. Emmerich ? &nbsp; EMMERICH ( quickly ) Not exactly that , but . . . well . . . the proposition sounds good , and I would like to see the most made of it . Every man should stick to his own trade , I suppose , but . . . ( his tone becomes bolder ) I know some very big men who might not be averse to a deal like this if properly approached  --  very respectable men , I might add . Let me see what I can do before you try  --  29  --  to find a fence . A few days wo n't make any difference to you , I imagine . . . &nbsp; DOCNot at all . ( he bows deprecatingly , and spreads his hands in a gesture of appealing sadness ) Except for one thing , Mr. Emmerich . I dislike to mention it , but I 've just come from prison and . . . &nbsp; EMMERICH ( laughing good-naturedly ) Cobby here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to stay .  --  Right , Cobby ? &nbsp; COBBYYou bet your life  --  I got some fancy phone numbers for you , too , Doc . Emmerich rises . It 's a signal  --  Doc and Cobby do likewise  --  dismissed . &nbsp; EMMERICH ( to Doc ) What 's it like  --  a man of your tastes  --  spending seven years behind the walls ? CAMERA PULLS AHEAD as the three men go to the door . &nbsp; DOCNot too bad  --  it 's a matter of temperament . I cause no trouble . The prison authorities appreciate that . They made me assistant librarian . &nbsp; EMMERICHI 'm afraid I would n't make a model prisoner . &nbsp; DOCAfter this job , it 's Mexico for me . I 'll live like a king . Mexican girls are very pretty . I 'll have nothing to do all day long , but chase them  --  in the sunlight . ( turning to Emmerich ) You 've been very kind , sir . He makes an elaborate bow . Emmerich shakes hands with them , and shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOOR As the CAMERA MOVES behind Emmerich , he turns through the hall , and crosses the living room . He stops , looking down toward the couch . The CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE past him , to the object of his attention : Angela . We SEE her clearly for the first time . She is lying asleep , in the twisted posture , one hand entangled in her hair , an open movie magazine on the floor beside her . She is eighteen or nineteen , with a child 's face and a figure that is voluptuous , if not particularly good . MEDIUM TWO-SHOT PAST ANGELA 'S SLEEPING FACE , TOWARD EMMERICH standing and staring at her . It is quiet in the house  --  quiet enough to hear the roadster pull out of the gravel driveway outside . Angela opens her eyes slowly , then twists back to look at him . &nbsp; ANGELAWhat 's the big idea  --  standing there staring at me , Uncle Lon ?  --  31  --  &nbsp; EMMERICHDo n't call me Uncle Lon . &nbsp; ANGELAUncle Lon ?  --  I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any more . Angela sits up , a little disturbed , as Emmerich moves away from her to the big easy chair , and sitting on one of the broad arms , begins to loosen his tie . &nbsp; EMMERICHWhy do n't you go to bed , baby ? MEDIUM TWO-SHOT PAST EMMERICH TO ANGELA as she gets up , comes toward him to unbutton his collar and take off his tie . &nbsp; ANGELAHere ! Let me do that . Emmerich , a cigar between his fingers , stoops a little to lift her face with both hands . &nbsp; EMMERICHSome sweet kid ! But she escapes his caress , smiling angelically . This mixture of desire and contempt leaves her profoundly puzzled . &nbsp; ANGELAI had the market send over some salt mackerel for you  --  best grade they could find . I know how you love it for breakfast . &nbsp; EMMERICH ( with effort ) Thanks , baby . Angela crosses the room , turning to blow a kiss , then going into her bedroom . &nbsp; ANGELAAnd I love you . &nbsp; EMMERICHSure , baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly locked . Then he turns to lift a telephone from a confusion of half empty dishes and glasses on a nearby table . MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT EMMERICH He dials each number with an effort , but when the connection is made , his voice takes on some of his customary hardness and vivacity . &nbsp; EMMERICHBob Brannom ? This is Emmerich . The voice at the other end is audible , but not intelligible . &nbsp; EMMERICH ( sharply ) I did n't call you to ask what time it is ,  --  I got a job for you . A pause  --  as Brannom 's voice makes some distasteful comment , which reflects itself on Emmerich 's face . &nbsp; EMMERICHNo  --  nothing like that . I 've got over a hundred thousand dollars on my books . Come to my office first thing in the morning .  --  I 'll give you a list of my debtors . Another pause . &nbsp; EMMERICHUse the methods called for in each individual case !  --  And do n't tell me about it  --  all I want is results .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I need it in cash . Is that clear enough ?  --  Goodnight , Bob . MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT CAMERA FOLLOWS Emmerich as he walks , lighting his cigar , back toward the big easy chair . Angela 's delicate , excessively high-heeled shoes are still resting on the seat . Emmerich picks them up and lets them drop wearily on the floor . He sits down in the chair and smooths his face with both hands . &nbsp; EMMERICHMy God !  --  I 'm tired . FADE OUT :  --  33  --  FADE IN : Section Details MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT DIX 'S FLAT DAY DIX LYING IN BED , ASLEEP , BUT RESTLESS AND DREAMING An edge of sunlight cuts across his face . He is talking in his sleep , commands , encouragement , but the words are muffled . A phone RINGS in the apartment . CAMERA PULLS BACK into a FULL SHOT OF THE ROOM . Doll , still in her cheap , glittering evening dress , is washing an accumulation of dishes . She wipes her hands and answers the phone . &nbsp; DOLL ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , Gus . . . She approaches the sleeping Dix , the phone in her hands , looking down at him as he mutters in his sleep . &nbsp; DOLL ( into phone ) He 's still asleep . . . How 's that ? . . .

He 's got something for you . &nbsp; DIX ( smiles ) Okay . ( he gets a cigarette , lights it with satisfaction ) &nbsp; DOLLCoffee , honey ? I 've made fresh . Dix gets out of bed to dress .

I was on that colt 's back . My father and my grandfather were there  --  watching the fun . The colt was buck-jumpin ' and pitchin '  --  and once he tried to scrape me off against the tree , but I stayed with him , you bet . Then I heard my grandpa say , He 's a real Handley , that boy  --  a real Handley.  --  And I felt proud as you please . &nbsp; DOLLDid something like that happen , Dix  --  when you were a kid ? &nbsp; DIXNot exactly . The black colt pitched me into a fence on the first buck , and my father come over and prodded me with his boot , and said , Maybe that 'll teach you not to brag about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pleasure at the recollection ) &nbsp; DOLLIt 's nice to hear you laugh .  --  35  --  &nbsp; DIXYou know something ?

One hundred sixty acres  --  thirty in blue grass  --  the rest in crops  --  fine barn  --  seven broodmares . &nbsp; DOLLSounds wonderful , Dix . &nbsp; DIXIt was . Then everything happened at once  --  my old man died  --  we lost our corn crop  --  the black colt I was telling you about , broke his leg and had to be shot . That was a rotten year . The mares were sold to save the farm , but we lost it anyway . I 'll never forget the day we left .

I never had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Twelve grand would have swung it , and I almost made it once . I had more than five thousand dollars in my pocket  --  Whirlaway was running in the Preakness .

He raises the cup to his lips . &nbsp; DIXThe way I figure , my luck 's just got to turn . . . One of these days , I 'll make a real killing . Then I 'll hit for home . First thing I do when I get there , is take a bath in the creek and get the city dirt off me.  --  36  --  Doll says nothing . Her lower lip is quivering . She is swallowing hard . Dix 's gaze finally settles on her . &nbsp; DIXWhat 's the matter ? ( she shakes her head ) Did I say something wrong ? &nbsp; DOLLNo , honey , no. ( she looks around the room ) Gee this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can you stand to live like this ? Dix looks at her , his thoughts elsewhere . DISSOLVE TO : pp. 1-19 &nbsp; pp. 37-56 INT MEDIUM SHOT COBBY 'S OFFICE DAY Dix is standing opposite Cobby , who has placed the barrier of a desk between them . On the desk lies a thick roll of bills , bound up in an elastic band .  --  37  --  &nbsp; DIXCount it . &nbsp; COBBY ( nervous and uneasy ) Look , Dix , you do n't have to pay the whole tab at once . &nbsp; DIX ( sullenly ) Count it . Cobby obeys , thumbing through the roll as hastily as he can . &nbsp; COBBY ( as he counts ) Why get sore ? No reason to get sore . &nbsp; DIXYou boned me in front of a stranger . Trying to make me look small . &nbsp; COBBY ( pocketing the money ) I tell you , I did n't mean it . I shoot my mouth off . Maybe I had a slight load on . You know how it is . &nbsp; DIXI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dix . I made a mistake . Do n't you ever make a mistake ? MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT DIX He rubs his hand slowly over his face .

I keep it for my very best friends . &nbsp; DIX ( with some contempt ) I do n't drink Scotch . Got some bourbon in the joint ?  --  38  --  &nbsp; COBBY ( O.S. ) Sure , sure .

Made in your home state . &nbsp; DOC ( to Dix ) Oh !  --  Where 's that , sir ? &nbsp; DIXKentucky . Boone County , Kentucky . He takes off his hat .

Brannom elevates his eyebrows . &nbsp; EMMERICHI could tell him I , myself , would fence the stuff  --  Promise him cash on delivery .  --  But , when the time came , I would n't have the cash .

You should n't have stopped me , Doc , when I was going to blast him . &nbsp; DOC ( drops the paper ; starts putting on his overcoat ) No , Dix , he has n't spilled . Or they would n't be looking for just me . &nbsp; DIXThen how come ? &nbsp; DOCBecause there 's only four or five men who could manage a job like this . Somebody in the department with a few brains has decided I 'm the guy . I 've been half expecting it . It does n't worry me much . We 'll get our money tomorrow , you bet . &nbsp; DIXHope so . . . .

Do n't worry about that , Mister . Dix and the little doctor leave without speaking again , closing the  --  99  --  door softly behind them . Eddie hurries on tip-toe , and stands with his ear pressed to the door . Presently he heaves a long sigh of relief . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details EXT MEDIUM LONG SHOT DESERTED BOULEVARD NIGHT Doc and Dix jaywalk over the wide thoroughfare . Doc carries the briefcase . On the opposite side of the street is a huge , ponderous , arcade-like structure , an old market , stretching for nearly three blocks , but condemned , and now partially open to the weather . Dix and Doc enter the building through a broken doorway . INT MEDIUM LONG SHOT THE OLD MARKET NIGHT The only illumination is far overhead  --  a faint glow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Doc are no more than shadowy silhouettes , their feet shuffling through a litter of old newspapers on the floor . On the river nearby , a tug moans on its way upstream , the sound echoing hollowly through the big empty building . As the two figures approach the CAMERA , they are suddenly illuminated in the circle of light from the beam of a torch . They both freeze . The hand holding the searchlight emerges into the F.G. , the cuff identifies it as part of a policeman 's uniform . &nbsp; POLICEMANWhere do you guys think you 're going ? &nbsp; DIXWe 're on our way home . &nbsp; POLICEMANWhere do you live ? &nbsp; DIXSouth on Camden . &nbsp; POLICEMANWell  --  you guys got no business in here  --  city property .

MEDIUM CLOSE THREE-SHOT , PAST DOC AND DIX toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go past him toward the street about ten feet beyond . The policeman plays his beam over the backs of Dix and then Doc , then switches it off . &nbsp; POLICEMANYeah . It 's already cost one of us boys his job on account of the beefs . If I was you guys I 'd stay out of here  --  understand ? &nbsp; DIXOkay , officer . The beam from the torch goes on again , playing over the doctor . &nbsp; POLICEMANWait a minute ! It seems to me . . . ! Come outside with me . In the F.G. , he puts the flashlight in his left hand , reaches around and pulls out his gun . There is a creak of holster leather . Dix turning , leaps at the policeman straight down the beam from the torch . There is a violent shock of bodies , the flashlight goes out as it strikes the floor . Missing the gun hand with his first grab , Dix strikes two hard blows into the policeman 's stomach . The gun in the policeman 's hand swings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two men , but just in time to be struck by the flailing gun . He stumbles backward into a pile of debris . In the half-darkness , there is the sickening sound of hard blows , struck with the metal object . There is a shuffling among the debris on the floor , the flashlight goes on , and is held by Dix , who has the policeman 's gun in his left hand , the barrel gripped like a club . He throws it away from him . Then he runs the beam along the floor till he finds Doc Riedenschneider , lying full length in a pile of old newspapers . CAMERA , PANS WITH DIX as he pulls Doc up to his knees , then to his feet . &nbsp; DIXCome on , Doc . Got the stuff ?  --  101  --  Doc , still groggy , mutters unintelligibly .

Doc falls into a chair . Gasping , he clutches the bag between his knees . Dix shuts and locks the door , draws the shades . &nbsp; DOLLI took three sleeping tablets , so I  --  I 'm kind of groggy .

She runs into the bathroom , stumbling in her haste . &nbsp; DOCYou put in hours and hours of planning  --  figure everything down to the last detail  --  then what ? Burglar alarms  --  103  --  start going off for no sensible reason . A gun fires of its own accord and a man is shot .

Dix helps the doctor off with his coat ; helps him over to the bed . &nbsp; DOCOne thing I ought 've figured and did n't was Emmerich . . . and I know why I did n't . I 'm not kidding myself . It was the extra dough he promised . I got greedy . Greed made me blind . Doll comes in with the water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Now for the first time , she sees his face .

And he 's kind of punchy , but the doctor does n't think he 's got a fracture .
