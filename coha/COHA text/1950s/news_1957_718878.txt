txt Governor Furcolo is using patronage as a major weapon in his fast-moving sales tax campaign . For the first time he is showing a willingness to utilize the powers at his command to swing Massachusetts legislators into line behind his 3 per cent sales tax , or a modified version of it . Despite increased pressures on legislators , prospects of passage at this point are still dim . An indication that the sales tax campaign is having some effect came from Senator John E. Powers ( D ) of Boston . Senate Minority Leader and an outspoken foe of the sales tax . He strongly objected today to the sales tax operations being conducted by Anthony Di Natale , treasurer of the 1956 Furcolo gubernatorial campaign , from a room in the Hotel Bellevue across the street from the State House . Democratic legislators are being called into conference with Mr. Di Natale , who is using patronage and other pressures in an effort to obtain backing tor the sales tax . " I do n't like people in hotel rooms calling in legislators , offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sales tax . " Senator Powers said , " It constitutes prostitution of the legislative process . " He warned legislators accepting jobs to return for a sales tax . vote that " they had better make sure the jobs they take are secure from legislative action because the Legislature can wipe jobs out of the . budget . " At the same time , Senator Powers promised to seek a referendum on the sales tax measure , if it is passed . Although the South Boston senator insists the sales tax will not pass , he said if the unexpected should take place he would call labor leaders and other leading opponents of the sales tax together to initiate a repeal referendum . Under the initiative and refer-. endum provisions of the constitution such a repeal referendum could be obtained , if petitions containing the signatures of voters numbering at least 13. i per cent of , the total vote cast for Governor in the last election are filed within 90 days of the effective date ot : the act . Referendum Weighed Thus , on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signatures would be required . If the required . number of valid signatues were filed , the issue would go on the 1958 state ballot on the question of repealing the sales tax law . Senator Powers said with the facilities of the labor organizations collection of the signatures should be comparatively easy . He added that such a referendum would force the Governor to run for reelection on the issue of a sales tax . Meanwhile , the South Boston legislator sought to minimize the effeffct of former President Truman 's support of the entire Furcolo program , including the sales tax . " It will have no effect whatever , " Senator Powers said . " It is a case of too little , too late . Furthermore , although former President Truman is for the sales tax , he does not have to pay it . He will be out of the state . " The Truman position was voiced at a University Club breakfast June 9 staged by Governor Furcolo. with about 200 prominent Massachusetts Democrats present . The former President told the Democrats they should support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made no direct reference to the sales tax . However , when Representative Louis H. Glaser ( Di of Malden asla , .1-1 Mr. Truman if his backing of the Furcolo program included the sales tax , Mr. Truman answered : " The entire program . " Mr. Truman said , " 1 do n't know what his program is but being the man he is , I know he has a first-class program . When he tells you it 's necessary , you must support him and go along with his program . " The Truman statement . followed by less than 24 hours a unanimous vote by the State CIO convention in opposition to the sales tax . The Massachusetts Federation of Labor is already waging an all-out campaign against . the measure . The sales tax controversy may reach a preliminary peak this week on Beacon Hill with a report from the legislative committee on taxation . The Furcolo forces have been working hard to gain a favorable committee report . Senator Powers today insisted the report would be favorable only if several members reserve their rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
