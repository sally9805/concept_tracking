The guest list read something like a combination of Who 's Who and Burke 's Peerage . E.M . Forster was there ; so was Novelist Rose Macaulay and Viscount Jowitt and the Earl of Ilchester . The man they had all come to honor , neither peer nor poet , was known to most of the guests as plain Mr. Cox . <P> Last week Mr. Cox was Starting his 70th year on the staff of the famed London Library . Though he has become a familiar figure among London 's great and near-great , few know where he lives , or what he does after he pads out of the library each evening at closing time . But there is scarcely a scholar in London who has not at some time sought his advice . " His name , " said the London Times last week , " is said to have come more often than that of any other man alive in the paragraphs of thanks in the prefaces of learned works . " <P> Frederick James Cox first popped up among the shelves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 16 . In those days , the library was only 41 years old-a private place of study , established by men like Thomas Carlyle who wanted something more convenient and less crowded than the British Museum . Mr. Cox never knew Mr. Carlyle ; nor did he know such early readers as Napoleon III and Lord Macaulay . But he used to chat with Gladstone ( " When you opened a door for him , he always raised his hat " ) , and he remembers Herbert Spencer struggling over his Principles of Sociology and Lord Granville queueing up for a book on the Irish Parliament . <P> As the years passed and the library grew in fame and riches , Londoners learned that Mr. Cox was no ordinary librarian . Perched in portly majesty on his chair behind the big librarian 's counter , he seemed to know the 500,000 books as if they were personal friends . He knew each one 's virtue , and lamented each one 's fault ; and if he happened to love a book ( as he often did ) , he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help-from Winston Churchill to Somerset Maugham to the little daughter of a member asking for a book on witches-was never disappointed . Mr. Cox would merely turn his head , fold his hands in front of him , and let the titles come rumbling out from under his white mustachios . <P> Last week , his party behind him , Mr. Cox was back on his perch again . At 85 , that was where he wanted to be .
