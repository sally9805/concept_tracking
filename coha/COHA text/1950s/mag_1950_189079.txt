For several years Britons have been looking down their noses at what they called " American spy hysteria . " Last week , when one of their top atomic scientists was arrested as a Russian spy , the superior British stare turned slightly glassy . Dr. Klaus Fuchs , once a trusted top-level worker at the U.S. Atomic Laboratory at Los Alamos , N. Mex. , had been detected , not by famed British Intelligence or Scotland Yard , but by the FBI , whom the British called into the case . Fuchs , said the FBI , had made a partial confession . He had been a secret member of the Communist Party for at least eight years , probably longer . Since 1943 he had had access to the tenderest U.S. and British atomic secrets . <P> Fuchs 's arrest hit Washington between the eyes . A member of the Atomic Energy Commission said : " We realized that this was one of the blackest days in the history ... of the security of this country . We are treating this as the biggest problem we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet met to discuss the case . One of those who attended the session said : " You ca n't overemphasize the seriousness of this development . " <P> The story that led up to this shock goes a long way back , and winds through two aberrant doctrines besides Communism-pacifism and Naziism . <P> In Catastrophe . Klaus Fuchs ( rhymes with books ) was born 38 years ago in Russelsheim , Germany . His father , Emil Fuchs , was first a Protestant minister , became a Quaker in 1925 . He was a lifelong member of the Socialist Party and a pacifist . During the 1930s the Nazis persecuted the whole family because of the father 's Socialism and pacifism . Emil Fuchs spent nine months in a concentration camp . One of Klaus 's sisters , a painter , became an active anti-Nazi political worker , helped her husband to escape from Germany , jumped to her death beneath a Berlin subway train after persecution had unbalanced her mind . The father , insisting that his fight was in Germany , stayed there through the war although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. ; one of his pamphlets , Christ in Catastrophe , has been published by Pendle Hill , a Quaker organization . <P> Young Klaus became an anti-Nazi leader among his fellow students at Kiel University . He escaped to Britain in the mid ' 30s . He became a British subject in 1942 and joined the British Communist Party . He stayed away from party meetings and from known Communists . He rarely discussed politics and disclosed no pro-Communist views . <P> Meanwhile , he had gained recognition as one of Britain 's brighter young nuclear physicists . In 1943 , he was one of a group of scientists sent to the U.S. to help out on the bomb , under an agreement between Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill , made at the Quebec Conference . Fuchs 's security was guaranteed in a letter from the British to the U.S. atomic authorities . <P> He spent months at Los Alamos . No security distinction was made inside the group of visiting British scientists : what one of its members knew , the others knew . While in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he passed information , according to the FBI account of Fuchs 's recent admissions.
