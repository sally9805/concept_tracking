A Story by PETER MATTHIESSEN Drawings by G. Hunter Jones TRAVELING MAX N OVEMBER on the Carolina coast is cold at night , a dark clear cold that kills the late mosquitoes . Toward dusk one evening , a black man slithered from a drainage ditch . He moved swiftly on his belly , writhing out across a greasy bog and vanishing into the sawgrass by the river . The grass stirred a moment and was still .. A rail bird rattled nervously , and a hunting gull , drawn inland , cocked a bright , hard , yellow eye . Startled , it dropped a white spot an the brown waste of the bog and banked downwind . Deep River is dark with piedmont silt and without depth or bottom . It bends its way to its wide delta like a great dead snake slung out across the tidewater , and in the summertime it smells , Alluvial ooze packed tight and rotting on its banks sucks into itself thc river debris . Through the grasses near the rim , Traver could see thc stranded tree limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . It was nearly dark . Raising his eyes to the level of the grass , he listened a last time . Then he slid forward and , on his knees in the shallows , wrenched the buried skiff from its sheath of mud . It came with a thick sucking sound and the rank breath of its grave . Traver knew without experiment that , upright , the skiff would fill immediately . He turned it turtle and waited . one moment more , gaining his wind . It was high water , the first of the ebb . The tide and river would be with him . He . shivered , moaning softly , though riot yet afraid . In the water , he kicked away from shore . An eddy curled him back upon the bank . He kicked away a second time , and caught the current . But the slimy hulk would not support his weight , and he coasted along beside it , one hand spread-fingered on the keel . He moved downstream .. Across the marsh , the lights switched back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pines . The voices came vaguely on the shifting river air , and a new sound stirred him . He inched lower in the water , so that only his hand and half his face broke the low outline of the skiff . Dey gone and put de hounds on dat man ' Traver . He giggled , teeth chattering , and cursed . The river dragged the capsized skiff across the coastal waterway , which parted the mainland from the . inner marshes of the barrier islands . Though wisps of cloud at times obscured the moon , the night was clear . No longer able to see the lights , he was alone in the cold river , which widened now as it neared its mouth . Ile thrashed his legs for warmth , and cursed to restore his courage . Southeast , an arm of woods from Ocean Island reached across the outer marshes toward the bank . He wanted to go aground there , and fearful of drifting past it to the open sea , began to swim the skiff inshore . He swore foully at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night world , and then he sang softly , despite himself afraid , a song known long ago in the shanties of Raccoon Creek . Faraway and gone am I toward dat judgment Day , Faraway and gone am I. ai n't no one gwine to stay , Lay down dis hail , lay down dis load , Gwine to take dat Heaven Road , Faraway and gone am I toward dat judgment Day . His voice hung plaintive in the thin mist over the river , and startled by it , he had a cold premonition of his death .. But an inshore current seized the skiff and swept it in beneath the bank . Nearing the piles of the abandoned land- ? ing , he forsook the skiff , and struggled through the shallow water . He had to drag himself ashore . Crouched beneath the wharf , too weak to beat his arms , he listened to hoarse , painful breaths he could not help . The skiff disappeared around the final bend , toward the booming where the seas broke on the bar . Traver scraped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife . Since the clothes he wore were the property of the state , this knife was his sole possession . He had had it fifteen hours . The knife was tong , with a spring blade , and when he had eaten , he played with it before replacing it in his pocket . Then he rose , peering over the bank at the trees a hundred yards away . Though sure he was alone on Ocean Island , he disliked outlining himself against the river . He went forward in a low crouch , covert , quiet . He liked to think he was quiet as an animal . I N THE shelter of the live oaks , for the first time since early morning , he stood straight . Stretching , he threw his shoulders back , legs spread in unconscious arrogance . Traver was a tall mart and very strong , with the big hands and haunches of his race . His skin was the mud black of the coastal Negro , and his left eye was obscured by scars which extended in cordy ridges toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched the skin , which was taut and smooth , like a rubber mask , The expression of MAGAZINE the mask was open , almost smiling , the boyish smile of a man enjoying himself without quite knowing why . Most of the time , this smile was genuine . Traver liked to laugh and , though good-natured , he also liked to fight . He had been fighting since the day when , brought home to Raccoon Creek by a wayward mother , he was nicknamed Traveler . His Daddy was a Travelin Man Traveled away and loft his Maui . The name became Traver , and stayed with him . And he had traveled north , south , east , and west , in and out of work and jail . He could stay no longer in a job than out of trouble . He had worked on the railroad and the chain gang and the big menhaden boats out of Hampton Roads , and everywhere he laughed like hell and finally fought . Every once in a while , half-drunk , he would come home . And his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in you , dass all , you like you daddy . And you heaclin straight fo trouble , big mule as you is . The last time home he had fought the man who happened to marry his girl . The man had knifed him near the eye . Unable to catch him , Traver , still bleeding , had burned their cabin down and taken the willing girl away . The sheriff followed in his own good time . I got your old place out the road gang saved for you , the sheriff said . We ai n't had a good laugh since you left . But now , a month later , he had escaped . He appeared with the knife in Raccoon Creek , but the man had moved away . The girl 's mother reported him , and he took to the woods , and kept . on going out across Deep River Marsh . The tide was flooding when he saw the skiff , and he had had to wait . He had scurried , crouched , scurried again , and once submerged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not picked up his trail in the green , broken scum and , voices rasping , they had passed . I a big ball gator , he sang now , a tough-hide long-tail mean 431 gator . Opening his open mouth a little more , he chortled soundlessly , still shivering . It growin cold , and dis gator ai n't no place to warm hisself . Well , I mean . Cold . He moved inland through the trees , away from the dark river . Ocean Island is long and large , spreading down some four miles from the delta , southwest toward Cape Romaine . The true land is a narrow spine supporting red cedar , cypress , yaupon , live oak , and the old-field pine , and here and there a scattering of small palmettos . There are low ridges and open groves and clearings , and a core of semi-tropic woods . Its south flank is salt marsh and ocean beach , and to the north , diked years ago above the tide , lies a vast , brackish swamp . The swamp is grassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lone , bony trees and hurricane dikes and sluice gates . Here , in a network of overgrown canals , the nut and widgeon grass grows in abandoned rice fields . Wildfowl winter in a diadem of reedy ponds , and coot and rail and gallinule , and predators . In the swamp , the predators move ceaselessly . He went to Snake-house . This was a sagging tool shed near the landing , so-called because in other times a worker had been bitten there , and died . In the dark , a sign , NO TRESPASSING , loomed white and new . The door was gone , but the dank interior gave shelter from the breeze . Traver stripped and wrung his clothes , then rubbed his body fiercely with his hands . He found an oily piece of old tarpaulin , and wrapping himself in it , dozed a little , fitful . He had come to Ocean Island because here he could survive . As a boy he had labored on the rice fields and the dikes , and he knew the name and character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to snare rabbits , stalk birds , ambush deer , and where the wild swine and cattle were which he might outwit and kill . On the salt shores there were razor clams and oysters , and mullet in the canals , if a fish trap could be rigged . He would not starve . He could even eat raccoon and otter and , if necessary , he could eat them raw . He could survive here , too , because he would not be caught . The island had been unused for years , even for gunning. if he were tracked to this forsaken place , he could always find shelter in the swamp . Hounds could not help them here , and the whites did not know the swamp as he did , how to move quickly in it without risking the deep potholes and soft muck . He could elude a wider search than the state would send into the swamp after a black man . For this was black man 's country , slow and silent , absorbing the white man 's inroads like a sponge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black man was swallowed up in it , and disappeared . In the night , he was awakened by the grunting of a hog . The grunt was nervous , and there was a skittish stamping of small , cloven hooves . He smell me , Traver thought . Taking his knife , he glided to the doorway . Upwind , the hog came toward him on the island path . He crouched , prepared to ambush it , then stiffened . 01 Hawg scairt . And he ; ai n't scairt of Traver . Traver stooped for his shirt and pants and slipped outside . The hog snorted and wheeled , crashing off into the brush . Traver slid down a sand bank behind Snake-house and lay watching . He heard a rush of bait fish by the landing , the choked cry of a night heron behind him . A barred owl stole over his head . This was the hunting time . T H E man had not seen Traver . He had stopped short at the crashing of the hog . Now he came on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall , lean man with a rifle slung over one arm and a flashlight , unlit , in the other hand . His face was shadowed in the moonlight by his hat brim , lowered all the way around . Traver opened the knife blade and lay still . He could not retreat now without being seen , and if he was seen , he was lost . He had no doubt that this man was his enemy , an enemy as natural as a raccoon to a frog , nor did it occur to him to curse his luck that an enemy was here at all . He was only relieved that he had heard in time . The rest no longer mattered . Traver was hardened to hunting and being hunted , and the endless adaptation to emergencies . He was intelligent and resourceful , and he was confident . Through the grasses , he gauged the stranger as he passed . From the man 's belt , behind , hung a hatchet and a piece of rope . The rifle , carried loosely , was ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was hunting . He crossed a patch of dry grass without sound , and Traver nodded ruefully in respect . Dat a poacher . Might be he jackin deer . The man went on , down toward the landing . Stooping on the wharf , he peered beneath it . Traver , who had moved , could see him do this , and felt a tightening in his chest . He see dem feet prints . He see white places where dem oyster was . You a plain fool nigger , man . The hunter returned , moving more quickly . Raising his rifle , he flicked his light into the Snake-house . Traver could see its gleam through the rotting tongue-and-groove . Ai n't no deer in dar , Boss , ai n't no deer in dar . He repressed a nervous giggle , sweating naked in the cold , and clutched his knife . Upwind , he could hear the hog again , rooting stupidly near the path . The white man turned , bent to one knee , and fired . Traver jumped . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lay still . 01 white folks , he kin shoot . Only why he shootin now and not before ? Ile lookin to fool somebody , he makin pretend he doan know somebody here . He know , all right . 01 white folks know . The man dragged the hog into the trees and dressed it quickly , viciously , with the hatchet and a knife . Then he piled brush on . the head and hooves and entrails and , rigging a sling with a length of rope , hoisted the carcass to his shoulder . He went away as silently as he had come , and Traver followed . We stickin close as two peas , man . I got to know what you up to every minute , lest you come sneakin up behind me . Traver , though uneasy , was excited , jubilant . It seemed to him that he had won some sort of skirmish , and he could scarcely wait to see what would happen next . But because he guessed where the man was going , he kept a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the old cabin of an abandoned shooting camp , and the only beach on the south side steep enough to bring a boat ashore . The poacher would have to have a boat , and he probably had a helper . Realizing this , Traver slowed , and put oit his cold clothes . He circled the clearing and came in from the far side , on his belly . There was kerosene light in the cabin window , and hanging from its eaves on the outside logs were moonlit amorphous carcasses . He made out deer and pig , and what could only be the quarters of a large wild bull . These cattle gone wild were the wariest creatures on the island , and Traver whistled softly at this sign of the hunter 's skill . It gave him another start of uneasiness . Backing off again on hands and knees , he cut himself a rabbit club of the right weight . Waiting for dawn , he whittled it , and bound with vine and a piece of shirt two sharp stones to the heavy end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it in his hand was reassuring . ? It was growing light . T H E boat appeared at sunup . Traver heard it a long way off , prowling the channel between islands at the southwest end . Now it drummed along the delta , just inside the bar , and headed straight in for the beach . It was a small , makeshift shrimp boat , with rust streaks and scalinggray-green paint . Before it grounded , the hunter Caine out and , hoisting two small deer onto his shoulders , went down to the shore . The two men loaded quickly . Then they stood a moment talking , the one on the pale sand of the beach , the other a black silhouette on the bow against the red fireball of the sun . For once in his life , Traver told himself , lie had to stop fooling and be serious . The boatman , who must have been in town the night before , had probably confirmed whatever the hunter had noticed at the landing . He wondered if they would turn him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could be shot on sight , and no questions asked  --  not that the hunter would require that excuse . He guessed that the latter had some right to be here , for otherwise , even in this lonely place , he would not occupy the cabin . He was probably a hired gamekeeper , poaching on the side . He would not want Traver here , and he would not want the sheriff nosing around the island , either . He would want to take care of Traver by himself . The man had come in and out of the cabin . He had the rifle in his hands , checking the action . His movements were calm and purpose-ful , and he gave Traver a good look at his face . It was a gaunt face , creased and hard , under heavy eyebrows , a shrewd face , curiously empty of emotion . Traver recognized that face , he had seen it all his life , throughout the South . 01 Redneck kill me , do he get the chance . And he mean to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snake-house , moving swiftly into the trees . For the moment , considering his situation , Traver stayed right where he was . He watched the shrimp boat disappear along the delta . His mouth was dry , and he licked dew from the grass . Though the early sun had begun to warm him , he felt tired and stiff and very hungry , and this hunger encouraged him to loot the cabin . Unreal in the morning mist , the trees were still . The Spanish moss hung everywhere , like silence . The man would go to Snake-house , to the landing , to pick up Traver 's trail , but it would not lead him far . Traver had stayed clear of the sand path , moving wherever possible on the needle ground beneath the pines . Still , if he meant to loot the cabin , he should hurry . And lie was half-risen when a huge blue heron , sailing above the cedars into which the hunter had disappeared , flared off with a squawk and thrash of heavy wings . Traver sank to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bein you last worldly move . I mean , he layin fo you , man , and he like to cotched you . I mean , he smart , doan you forget it , nigger . He know- what you doin even fore you does it . Traver waited again . When his heart stopped pounding , he began to laugh , a long quiet laugh that shook his big body like crying , and caused him to press his . mouth to the crook of his arm . And he was surprised when tears came to his eyes , and the laughter became sobbing . He was frightened , he knew , and at the same time , he was unbearably excited . You just a big black mule , you just a fool and a mule and a alligator all wrap into one . He went on laughing , knowing his delight was dangerous , and all the more elated because of that . And as he laughed , he hummed to himself , in hunger , Ham-bone is good , o so-o good , Bacon is sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fine , fine , fine , But give me , 0 give me , 0 , how 1 wish you would , Dat wa-tuh melon smilin on de vine .. In a while , far over toward the swamp , he heard the quack of startled black ducks , rising . When he saw their high circle over the trees , he got up on his haunches . Could be dat a duck hawk , but most likely dat him . He over dar by Snake-house . A string of ibis , drifting peacefully down the length of woods like bright white sheets of tissue , reassured him . Traver ran . In the open , he tensed for the rifle crack he could never have heard had it come , and zigzagged for the door . In less than a minute , he was back . He had a loaf of bread and matches , and was grinning wildly with excitement . But now a fresh fear seized him . The hunter might return at any time , from any angle . If he did not hurry , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being seen . Traver stopped chewing , the stale bread dry in his mouth . Then he cut into the woods , loping in. a low , bounding squat in the direction taken by the white man . At Graveyard-over-the-Bank , where once the cattle had been driven , penned , and slaughtered , he hid again . This place , a narrowing of the island , the man would sooner or later have to pass . T RAVER stalked him all that day . Toward noon , the hunter went back to the cabin . Traver could hear him rummage for the bread , and he wondered if , in taking it , he might only have endangered himself further by becoming , in the white man 's eyes , more troublesome . The man came out again and sat on the doorsill , eating . His face , still calm , was tighter , meaner , Traver thought . The rifle lay across his knees . Then he rose and went away into the woods , heading southwest toward Cottonmouth Dike , and Traver followed . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that not surprise his quarry , that Traver was in all probability behind him , for though he moved stealthily out of habit , he made no real effort to conceal himself . Clearly , his plan was to lure Traver into a poor position , a narrow neck or sparsely wooded place where he might hope to turn and hunt him down . He set a series of ambushes , and now and then wheeled and doubled back along his trail . He was skillful and very quick , quick enough to frighten Traver , who several times was nearly trapped . Traver hung farther and farther behind , using his knowledge of the island to guess where the hunter would come and go , and never remaining directly behind , but quartering . He was most afraid of the animals and birds which , hunting and hunted , could betray his whereabouts at any time . The white man was tireless , and this intensity frightened Traver , too . He seemed prepared to stalk forever , carrying his provisions in his pocket . When he ate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Traver could never relax enough to hunt , could only watch and starve . By noon or the second day , Traver was desperate . When the man went west again , way over past Pig Root and Eagles Grave , Traver lied eastward to the landing , and gorged on the coon oysters . Sated , he realized his mistake . He had a hundred yards of marsh to cross , back to the trees , and for all he knew , the hunter had doubled back again , and had a bead on him . He had done just what the man was waiting for him to do , he had lost the scent , and now any move he made might be the wrong one . He groaned at the thought of the vanished skiff  --  if only he 'd gotten it ashore , and hidden it in the salt grass farther down . But now he was trapped , not only at the landing but on the island . A bittern broke camouflage with a strangled squawk , causing Traver to spin around . In panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the trees . The woods were silent . There came a faint cry of snow geese over the delta , and the sharp rattle of a kingfisher back in the slough . Downwind , wild cattle caught his scent , retreating noisily . Or was that the coining of the hunter ? He pressed himself to the black earth , in aimless prayer . The silence grew , cut only by the wash of river wind in the old-field pine . Then a wren called , Peter , Peter , Peter , and a hawk flicked quickly overhead in its direction . Peter , Peter , Peet At dark , he fled into the marsh , and tried to rest in the reeds beneath a dike . Under the moon , much later , a raccoon picked its way along the bank , and he stunned it with his rabbit club . The coon played possum . When he crawled up to it , it whirled and bit him on the ankle . He struck it sharply with the stone end of the club , and it dragged itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and , in a near frenzy of suppressed fear , he beat the dark shape savagely , long after it was dead . Panting , he sat and stated at the wet , matted mound of fur , the sharp teeth in the open , twisted mouth . He dared not light a fire with his stolen matches , and his gut was much too nervous to accept it raw . He left it where it lay and crept hack to the woods and , in an agony of stealth , to Back-of-Ocean . He  --  was overjoyed by the lamp in the cabin window . He finally tuckered out , Traver told himself . The man done give of Traver up , Traver too spry fur him . The idea restored his confidence a little , and he chuckled without heart . He was still hungry , and he had no idea what his next move should be . Remembering the white man 's face , he did not really believe he had given up- the hunt , and this instinct was confirmed , at daybreak . The boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lint he did not come out of the cabin . He stepped into the clearing from the yaupon on the other side . Traver had almost approached that way the night before . The light in the window had only been another trap . Traver fought a wild desire to bolt . But he controlled himself , squeezing great fistfuls of earth between his fingers . He watelied the hunter walk slowly to the beach and , resting his rifle butt on the silver roots of a hurricane tree , speak to the boatman . They were silent for a time , as if deciding something . Then the hunter shrugged , and shoved the boat from shore . It backed off with a grinding of worn gears . He returned to the cabin and came out of it a minute later . He had a cooked bone , and he pulled long strings of dry meat from it with his teeth , Traver stared at the lean yellow-brown of his face , the wrinkled neck , the faded khaki clothes and high , cracked boots against the soft greens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bone . The man tossed it out in front of him , then tramped it into the ground and lit a cigarette . Breathing smoke , he leaned against the cabin logs and gazed around the clearing . Traver caught the cigarette scent on the air , and stirred uncomfortably . The man flipped the butt into the air , and together they watched it burn away upon the ground . Then he shouldered the rifle and went back to the woods , and once more Traver followed . Who huntin who heap ? Traver tried to smile . Who huntin who ? The fear was deep in him now , like cold . He started at every snap and crackle and cry of bird , sniffing the air for scents which could tell him nothing . There was only the stench of rotting vegetation , and the rank sweat of his fear . He crept along closer and closer to the ground , terrified lest he lose contact with the hunter . In his heah , he knew there was but one course open to him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed . Both prospects were unimaginable . But he could kill . Man , you in de swamp now . It you or him , dass all . But he could not make himself accept this . He supposed he could kill a black man if he had to , and a white man could kill him . But a black man did not kill a white man unless the black man was insane . Man , it doan matter what de color is , it just doan matter now . You in de swamp , and de swamp a different world . Dev ai n't nobody left in dis heah world but you and him , and he figger dass too crowded . When of Lo 'd passed out de mens 's hearts , dis heah man hid behind de do ' . A man like dis heah man , you let him run where he de law , and he kill you if you black or white or blue . He ai n't no more civilized den a cat gone wild . He Joan hate you and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You just a varmint dat got in de way , dass all . But Traver doubted his own sense . Perhaps this man had nothing to hide , perhaps he was hunting legally , perhaps he would do no more than remove Traver from the island , or arrest him  --  how could he , Traver , know that this man , given the chance , would shoot him down ? And yet he knew , as wild animals know , by instinct . He could smell it . He doubted his instinct because , himself civilized , he hated what it told him , because he wanted to believe that this man also was afraid , that a man would not shoot another down without first calling out to him to surrender . Man , he ai n't called , and he know you heals . He quiet as dc grave . And you take it in you hair ! to call you'self , you fixin to get a bullet fo you answer . His only chance was to five by animal law . It was this that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A GAIN that morning , he was nearly am- bushed . This time a rabbit gave the man away . For the first time , Traver lost his nerve entirely . He ran back east along the island and stole out on the marsh , crawling along the dike bank where he had killed the coon , persuading his pounding heart that food was his reason for coming . But he knew before he got there that the raccoon would be gone . Black vultures and an eagle rose in silence from the hank , and there was a flat track in the reeds where an alligator had come and gone , and there were blue crabs clinging upside clown to the grass at the edge of the ditch . In the marsh , the weak and dead have a brief existence . Traver was shifting his position when a bullet slapped into the mudbank by his head . Its whine he heard afterward , a swelling in his ears as he rolled into the water and clawed at the brittle stalks of cane across the ditch . A wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blurred his racket in the brake . He crossed a reedy flat and slid into a small pool twenty yards away . The echo of the shot diminished on the marsh , and silence settled , like a cloud across the sun . Then fiddler crabs snapped faintly on the flat . Where he had passed , their yellow claws protruded , open , from the holes . But he knew the man would come , and he tried to control the choked rasp of his breath . And the man came , picking his lean way along the dike , stopping to listen , coming on , as Traver himself had often done , tracking crippled ducks for the plantation gunners . Against the bright , high autumn sky , the hunter 's silhouette was huge . Traver slipped the rabbit club from his belt . The game was ending now , and he knew only the intense fear and hate of an animal straining toward survival . The man had stopped just short of where Traver had lain . He squinted up and down the ditch . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the trigger guard and breech , betrayed his awareness that Traver might have a weapon . He came a little farther , stopped again . He seemed on the point of calling out , but did not , as if afraid of intruding a human voice into this primeval silence . He bent and scratched his leg . Then , for a moment , scanning the far side of the dike , he turned his head . Traver , straightening , tried to hurl the club , but it would not leave his hand . He ducked down and out of sight again . He told himself that the range had been too great , that the chance of a miss , however small , could not be taken . But he also knew he was desperate enough to have thrown it anyway , in agony , simply to bring an end to this suspense . There was something else . The man descended from the dike , on the far side . Almost immediately , he sank up to his knees , for there came a heavy , sucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that here , in the black resilience of the marsh , his quarry had him at a disadvantage , for he climbed back up onto the dike and took out a cigarette . This time Traver thought he must call out , but he did not . Instead , he made his way back toward the woods . Traver cursed him , close to tears . The hunter had only to watch from the trees at the end of the dike . Until dark , Traver was trapped . The hunter would sit down on a log and eat his food , while Traver lay in the cold pool and starved . The whole world was eating , hunting and eating and hunting again , in an endless cycle , while he starved . From where he lay , he could see a marsh hawk quartering wet meadows , and an eagle 's patient silhouette in a dead tree . Swaying grass betrayed a prowling otter , and on a mud flat near him , two jack snipe probed for worms . Soon , in that stretch of ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank de Lo 'd it you what stole my coon . Thank de Lo 'd dis pool too shaller for you daddy . The alligator floated , facing him . Only its snout and eyes disturbed the surface , like tips of a submerged branch . What you waitin on , Ugly ? You waitin on of Traver , man , you got to get in line . The insects had found Traver , and he smeared black mud on his face and hands . Northeast , a vulture circled slowly down on something else . Whole world waitin on poor Traver . Whole world hangin round to cat on Traver . And though he said this to cheer himself , and even chuckled , the sense of the surrounding marsh weighed down on him , the solitude . Inert , half-buried , Traver mourned a blues . Black river bottom , black river bottom Nigger sinkin down to dat black river bottom Ai n't comin home no mo ' 01 Devil layin at dat black river bottom Black river bottom , black river bottom , Waiting fo ' de nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home no mo ' . . At dark , inch by inch , circuitously , Traver came ashore . He knew now he must track the man and kill him . His nerves would not tolerate another day of fear , and he took courage from the recklessness of desperation . Again the cabin was lit up , but this time he smelled coffee . The man 's shadow moved against the window , and the light died out . The man would he sitting in the dark , rifle pointed at the opei . door . The hunt ended early the next morning . T RAVER bellied across a clearing and slid down a steep bank which here joined the high ground to the marsh . His feet were planted in the water at the end of Red Gate Ditch , and on his right was a muddy , rooted MAGAZINE grove of yaupon known as Hog Crawl . The hunter was sonic distance to the eastward . Traver had a length of dry , dead branch . He broke it sharply on his knee . The snap rang through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Crawl . Then Traver waited , peering through the grass . He had his knife out , and his rabbit club . Lifting one foot from the water of the ditch , he kicked a foothold in the bank . Below him , the scum of algae closed its broken surface , leaving no trace of where the foot had been . The man was coining . Traver could feel him , somewhere behind the black trunks of the trees . The final sun , which filtered through the woods from the ocean side , formed a strange red haze in the shrouds of Spanish moss . Out of this the man appeared . One moment there was nothing and the next he was there , startling the eye like a copperhead camouflaged in fallen leaves . He Moved toward Traver until he reached the middle of the clearing , just out of Traver 's range , facing the Hog Crawl . There he stood stiff as a deer and listened . Traver listened , too , absorbing every detail of the scene through every sense . The cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , the smell of the earth so strong . Though tense to the breaking point , he felt powerfully alive , exultant . For the trap was his , he was the hunter now , on his own ground . And the white man shifted , stepping a little closer . The hog snuffled again , back in the yaupon . Traver could just make it out beneath the branches , a brown-and-yellow brindle sow , caked with dry mud . Now it came forward , curious . It would sec Traver before it saw the white man , and it would give him away . Traver swallowed . The sow came toward him . red-eyed . The white man , immobile , waited for it , also . When the sow saw Traver , it stopped , then backed away a little , then grunted and trotted off . Traver flicked his gaze back to the man . He was suspicious . Black eyes wide , head up , he froze . Then slowly the rifle swung around until it was pointed a few feet to Traver 's left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray , 0 Lo 'd , he gwine kill me now . Traver was backing down the bank as the man moved forward . Beneath the turned-down brim , the eyes were fixed on the spot to Traver 's left . Traver flipped the butt of broken branch in the same direction . When the white mart whirled upon the sound , Traver reared and hurled his club . He did not miss . It struck just as the shot went off . Traver had rolled aside instinctively , but this same instinct drove him to his feet again and forward . The man lay still beside the rifle . The hand which had been groping for it fell back as Traver sprang . He pressed his knife blade to the white , unsunburned patch of throat beneath the grizzled chin . Kill him , kill him now . But he did not . Gasping , he stared down at the face a foot from his . It was Weeding badly from the temple but was otherwise unchanged . Pinning the man 's arms with his knees , he pushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , unblinking , like the eyes of a wounded hawk . " Wa'nt quite slick enough fo Traver , was you ! " Traver panted . He roared hysterically in his relief , his laughter booming in the quiet grove . " You fall fo de oldes trick dey is , dass how smart you is , white folks ! " He roared again into the silence . " 01 Traver toss de branch , ol white boy fooled , ol white boy cotch it in de haid ! I mean ! De oldes trick dey is ! " Traver glared down at him , hoarse , triumphant . The man lay silent . Traver ran the knife blade back and forth across the throat , leaving a thin red line . He forced his anger , disturbed at how swiftly his relief replaced it . " You de one dat 's scairt now , ai n't you ? Try to kill dis nigger what never done you harm ! You loan know who you foolin with , white trash , you foolin with a man what 's mule and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , what you think ' bout dat ? " The white man watched him . " Ai n't you nothin to say fore 1 kills you ? You gwine pray ? Or is I done killed you already ? " Uneasy astride the body of the white man , Traver rose to a squat and pricked him with his knife tip . " Doan you play possum with me , now ! You ai n't foolin me no mo ' , 1 gwine kill you , man , you heals me ? " For the first time , Traver heard his own voice in the silence , and it startled him . He glanced around . The sun was bright red over the live oak trees , but quiet hung across the marsh like mist . Out of the corner of his eye , he watched the white man with suspicion , but the other did not stir . He dead , Traver thought , alarmed . I done killed him dead . Avoiding the open eyes , he picked up the rifle and stared at it . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the grass . Then he stepped back , knife in hand , and prodded the body with his toe . " tit up , now ! " he cried , startling himself again . " You ai n't bad hurt , Cap'n , you just kinda dizzy , dais all . Now us is got to do some taIkin , heah me now ? " But the body was still . A trail of saliva dribbled from the narrow mouth , and a fly lit on the grass near the bloody temple . Traver bent and crossed the arms upon the narrow chest . " You fall fo de oldes trick in de world , " Traver mourned , and shook his head . " Dass what you done . " Badly frightened , he talked to comfort himself , glancing furtively around the clearing . He started to back away , then bolted . The man rolled over and up onto his knees , the rifle snatched toward his shoulder . He sighted without haste and fired . Then he reached for his hat and put it on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up . Traver was a powerful man and did not fall . He could still hear the echo and the clamor in the marsh , and he could not accept what was happening to him . He had never really believed it possible , and he did not believe it now . He dropped the knife and staggered , frowning , as the man walked toward him . The second bullet knocked him over backwards , down the bank , and when he came to rest , his head lay under water . His instinct told him to wriggle a little further , to crawl away into the reeds . He could not move . He died .
