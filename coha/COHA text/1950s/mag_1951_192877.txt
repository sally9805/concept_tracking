Like most of Asia , in the days before Mossadegh , India lit its lamps and powered its gasoline engines largely with Abadan petroleum . Then Abadan shut down . India , pinched for oil ( it had to cut civil air traffic 20% ) , awakened to the fact that it was refining only about 6% of the oil it consumed . <P> The new state decided that it must refine its own , and that it needed help . But here it ran smash into its own hostility to foreign businessmen . To get oil , India would have to break with old prejudices . <P> Last week it manfully did . In a letter to the U.S.-owned Standard-Vacuum Oil Co. , India 's government promised to change its ways and its laws , persuaded Standard-Vacuum to build a $35 million refinery near Bombay . Specifically , the government would scrap the law that Indians must own 51% of the stock of a foreign company . It would give unbreakable guarantees against nationalization for 25 years at least . The refinery will be allowed to import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . <P> Similar offers went to Caltex of California and Britain 's Burmah-Shell . In return the three outfits would promise to train Indian technicians , employ as much Indian labor as possible , and stimulate Indian industries . By 1955 the companies hope to have three oil refineries worth $100 million , producing two to three million tons of refined products a day . A compact advantageous to both parties , it is also welcome as the first major investment of private U.S. capital in India since India won its independence .
