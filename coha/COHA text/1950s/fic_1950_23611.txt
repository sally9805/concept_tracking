The Exile Katherine Anne Porter Drawings by Bernardo Bryson T HERE was a noticeable commotion at the Cuban students ' table . The boys rose from their chairs and bowed in the direction of the door and one of them said , " Viva ! " explosively . The woman who came in made them a formal little bow , very old-fashioned and learned in courtesy , then followed the waiter to a small table where she sat with her back to the students . They sat down again exchanging odd , malicious glances , wiping away smiles under their napkins . She was perhaps fifty years old and she had been a fine beauty not so long ago . Her face was smooth and wax-colored , her small round mouth was painted bright red , the small , clever-looking black eyes were sketched in with long dark blue smudges , her lightly tinted reddish hair was cut short and curled around her forehead and ears . She was slender except for a lazy little belly , and her clothes were very expensive looking ; shabby as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present occasions . She wore enormous pearls in her ears , around her throat , on two fingers of her left hand . On her right she wore alarge light-colored flawed emerald . These hands , very narrow , fine , heavily veined , and old looking , were in constant movement . Thumbs turned in lightly to the palm , the hands moved aimlessly from the edge of the table to her lap , they clasped and unclasped themselves , spread themselves flat in the air , closed , shook slightly , went to her hair , to the bosom of her gown , as if by a life of their own separate from the will of the woman herself , who sat quite still otherwise , her features a little rigid , bending to read the lunch card beside her plate . Everybody in the ship 's dining room turned to stare at her . 44 UT where , " inquired Frau Rittersdorf of the Captain , " where does she come from ? No one saw her come on board , " she said , anxiously , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " " And no wonder , " said the Captain . " That lady  --  she is a Spanish Countess  --  was brought on board quietly , hours before the other passengers , by two police officers who attempted at once to escort her to the steerage , under " The Exile " concludes this series of three episodes from Miss Porter 's novel-inprogress , No Safe Harbor . The setting is a German transatlantic liner ; the date , 1931 . The most recent book by Katherine Anne Porter is The Leaning Tower . the impression that I was going to put her in chains for the voyage , or at least confine her to a cabin . I could not treat a lady so , no matter what she had done , " said the Captain , and his eyes rested gently upon the Countess ; indeed they feasted themselves upon that personage , a real member of the nobility , a species seen all too rarely on his modest decks . " Her hands , " exclaimed Lizzi , " what is she doing with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nervousness , " said Dr. Sacher . " She will feel better shortly . " His glance and tone were drily professional . " A little on the faded side , " said Herr Rieber , and instantly repented his tactlessness when seven pairs of eyes fastened upon him in rebuke . " She is not young , true , " said Dr. Sadler , " and her troubles are rather complicated . " " Would I not be a dupe , " asked the Captain , glancing sharply from face to face , " to take the Latin-American politicals seriously ? I was told she is a dangerous revolutionist , an international spy , that she carries messages from one hotbed of rebellion to another , that she incites to riot , you would hardly believe all the nonsense . My own opinion is , she is one of these idle rich ladies who like excitement , who get into mischief without knowing what they do ; and she has got her fingers badly burnt . " Well , this experience will teach her a lesson , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only going to Tenerife , in any case . That is not so bad , and in the meantime , I wish her a pleasant voyage . " " Those students who greeted her with such apparent respect , " remarked Herr Professor Hutten thoughtfully , " resemble very little the revolutionary type as I have learned to recognize it in Mexico . I should have said they are the lamentably over-indulged sons of well-to-do parents who have not taken their parental duties very seriously . It is a type all too prevalent in Mexico , indeed , in all the Americas . One of our problems , " he said , " was to protect our German youth from their influence in our schools . I am happy to say , relying on the infallible combination of German character and German methods of discipline , we enjoyed a modest success . " ? " I had never imagined a revolutionist wearing such pearls , " said Frau Rittersdorf , " if indeed they are real , which is doubtful . " " When such a lady wears pearls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we may be confident they are real . " " The students , " said the Captain to Herr Professor Hutten , heading off this dangerous feminine diversion of the topic , " are on their way to complete their studies in Montpellier , since the University in Cuba has been closed over their heads . Something to do with the general disturbances there . It is all disorder of a most senseless kind , naturally , and should have been put down without hesitation Iong ago , with every necessary severity . As for revolutionists , they are a species of animal I am not acquainted with ; I leave them to those whose business it is to deal with them . " Leaning his head low over his plate , ducking up and down rhythmically , he began to swallow soup . The subject seemed closed , satisfactorily , on exactly the right note . 72 J ENNY , who felt refreshed and good tempered after her nap , told David what she knew about the Countess , and was surprised at the look of lively admiration on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become rather calmer and was peering nearsightedly into her salad . " Who told you all this ? " he asked , unable to believe anything jenny said , however entertaining it might be . " Wilhelm Freytag , this morning while we were walking around deck , " said Jenny . " Is it a habit by now ? " asked David . " This is only the second morning , " said Jenny . " I wish you 'd look at the Spanish company , are n't they weird ? " For some reason she could not admit the human existence of the Spanish company . They seemed to her to be life-sized dolls dancing gracefully at the ends of strings , going through a perpetual pantomime of mock emotion . Their frowning faces , their gestures of anger , ill humor , contempt , all seemed too far-fetched and rehearsed to be probable ; she did not believe that any of it proceeded from living organisms . They had hardly removed their several gazes from the Countess since she appeared , and their eyes were charged with staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their mouths sullen , and as they ate , or turned their heads , their eyes moved and maintained their gaze . " If they 're planning to rob her , " said Jenny , " they will give themselves away longbefore the deed . That fellow they call Pepe has n't taken his eyes off her necklace once . And I really ca n't blame him . Look , David Darling , is n't it superb ? " " It seems all right , " said David , " but they could be beads from the ten-cent store and I would n't know . " " You might at least admit they are beautiful . " " I 'm not sure I think so , " said David . " I 'm too blinded with prejudice against the kind of person who can afford to wear pearls . " " It 's handsome of you to concede that much , " said Jenny . " It is really handsome of you . " " I 'd perhaps like her better if I knew they were n't real , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is-just the kind of fellow you are , " said Jenny , with sudden gaiety , " but me , I am a more ample nature . I can love you with your prejudices and real pearls both , you 'll be shocked to hear . " She smiled at him , he watched the smile change her face altogether for the better , and smiled back at her lovingly . They seemed beautiful to each other and a pleasant silence came over them . D R. SACHER , seolling about the deck after lunch , paused to glance at the horse races , set up for the first time , and was indignant when he saw that , in spite of his express orders , the boy with the floating kidney had been put again at the job of moving the toy animals along the track . A small number of passengers were sitting about comfortably , their faces smoothed and at ease , eyelids relaxed behind dark glasses , enjoying the sunlight and the sea air , but the boy sweated as he stooped and rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark lines around his pale gray mouth , his eyes strained . The other boy was tough and able , but he kept his eyes down as if he were ashamed of his childish occupation . Further along , Dr. Sacher saw the tall shrill girl and the little fat man playing Ping-pong violently , and several persons were splashing about in the small canvas swimming tank set up on the lower deck . On the port side Dr. THE EXILE Sacher stepped carefully around a game of shuffleboard , without observing the players , but nodding in their direction ; and saw at the same time , almost without seeing , Ric and Rac , the two Spanish children , beguiling the ship 's cat , a fine tiger tom , with backstrokings and tieklings under his chin . The cat arched , his face full of sophisticated pleasure , and allowed himself to be picked up between them . He was heavy , loose , ungainly , and in his sensual trance he did not grasp the nature of their intentions toward him until it was almost too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rac lifted him to the rail and tried to push him overboard . He stiffened , dug his fore-claws into the rail , braced and clawed fiercely with his hind feet ; his back went into a bow , his tail became a wild plume . Silently , desperately , he fought with all his weapons , but they were not enough . Dr. Sacher fairly leaped forward and seized the children back from the rail . They brought the cat with them in their rush ; he fell out of their clutches and tore his way acrogs , deck . The children stared upward at Dr. Sachet- , their arms , striped with long bleeding scratches , going suddenly limp in his hands . Dr. Sacher , holding them firmly but with practiced gentleness , examined the depths of their eyes for a moment with a twinge of dismay at their blind , unwinking malignance , their cold slyness  --  not beasts , though , but human creatures . Oh , yes , human , more 's the pity , thought the Doctor , ? loosening his hold . Instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning toward each other with their instinctive look of complicity . They ran , their thin legs jutting at the knees , their tangled hair flying . He supposed they should have at least iodine on those scratches , but he felt they would probably do as well without it . H E SAT down carefully in the nearest deck chair , breathing as lightly and deliberately as he could , holding himself together with intent stillness . He had a very ordinary kind of heart trouble and might drop dead at any moment . He felt his pulse softly with two fingers , but he knew the count already ; he knew exactly what washappening , what always did happen at the slightest shock or sudden movement : he had been over this rather dull case so often in the past few years there was nothing new to say or think , above all , nothing new to he done . He had always tried to avoid diagnosing and treating himself , he made a habit of consulting doctors he believed more able than he , he wished to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really needed to be told what his trouble was . In the end , there was nothing in medical science to relate in his mind what he knew about himself as physician and what he felt about himself as a man in danger of death from one moment to the next . He sat with the fated calm of a man caught in a thunderstorm in an open space , rather humorously and bitterly counting on a mathematical scale of chance he knew to be mythical . At last , cautiously , he felt in his inside pocket and brought out the small phial of crystal drops . The thing he could never explain to himself was this : knowing about himself such a simple daylight fact , with his orderly plan to live as long as he could on whatever terms he could make with his disease , he had endangered his life to save the life of a cat , a kind of animal he disliked by temperament ; he was devoted to dogs . Given a moment for reflection , would he have leaped so and risked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife ? He had never been required to face that emergency , and the question was an absurdity , of course . Of course . The answer was clear , it had been settled long ago , or so he hoped . He smiled inwardly , with a composed face , at the thought of the cat , that supposedly most astute and self-possessed of all animals , being seduced within an inch of his life by a tickling of his nerve ends , the pleasant crackle of his own electricity along the fur of his spine . Nothing in his celebrated instincts had warned him that those stroking hands were willing to give him a moment of his private pleasure so that they might the more easily seize him by the scruff for their own satisfaction . Perhaps that should not be surprising , it happened to others besides cats . He had spent the best years of his life  --  after all , how else would he have spent them ? ? patching up , for mysterious reasons of his own , the deceived , the Foolhardy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most deadly of them all , the one who knew what he was doing and what he was bringing upon himself , and yet could not resist for anything one more fling at his favorite hot thrill of the flesh  --  drink , drugs , sex  --  whatever his particular concupiscence might be , though it might be his own death . His own death , or my own death , I know it is of no importance , the doctor told himself , especially my own if I have made my peace with it ; he touched his wrist again with two fingers and waited . He longed so deeply to live , merely to breathe , to move in his familiar body , to stay safely within himself , a place he knew as home , he could not control the warm wave of excitement which ran all through him , as if he had drunk hot spiced wine . " My God , " he said , and fixed his eyes attentively on the deep waves of the sea , turning upon each other endlessly , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed in universal harmony , " My God , my God ! " Dr. Sadler believed in God , finally , in a particularly forthright . Bavarian Catholic way , and having spoken the Name , he closed his eyes , gave himself over , and became soothed and quiet . Deliberately he removed his fingers from his pulse , ignored the beat of his heart upon his eardrums , and for a few minutes his whole being reconciled itself almost completely to the idea of death , despising briefly , but with satisfaction , the cowardice of the flesh . He realized then that the drops were working , as they had before , as they might again and again ; that the attack , a light one , was passing over ; he had escaped once more . He opened his eyes and crossed himself unobtrusively , noticing at the same instant an arresting scene . sour twenty feet away the Countess was talking to a young sailor . He was a very attractive-looking fellow , with a fine show of manly muscles in shoulders and arms , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad mouth and slightly snubbed nose . He stood perfectly straight , hands at his sides as if at attention before an officer , but his head was inclined MAGAZINE away , and he looked steadily past the Countess except for one or two quick , uneasy glances at her . His back was to the rail , he was almost touching it , and the Countess stood before him , talking very intently but slowly , spreading her arms now and then as if she would bar his way . Her thumbs were turned in flat to her flattened palms , which moved in a monotonous beat ; her eyes were like agates , and she swayed from side to side , stretching her neck , trying to make the boy look her in the face . His head turned from her , far to one side and then in a slow swing back again , but nodding as if in agreement , full of shame and confusion . The Countess suddenly patted him on the arm , at which he leaped as if an electric wire-end had touched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stepped past her and seized his bucket and brush , making off in a long stride , his face and ears a burning red , leaving the Countess standing . After a moment she walked slowly in the same direction , her neck and spine very straight , her hands clenched into fists at her sides . Dr. Sadler , finding himself of at least three minds in the matter , that is , simple human curiosity , an unwilling admiration for the woman who struck him as unusually beautiful , and that professional interest which had become second nature in him , rose and followed her at a good distance , keeping the appearance of being on a casual promenade . w ITHIN the next hour , the Doctor had seen ? enough to make him very thoughtful . Wherever she saw a man alone , any son of man so he was young , the doctor observed with a good deal of moral disapproval , whether sailor or officer or passenger , she backed him into a corner or against a wall or rail , and somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that intimate way , as if she were imparting some agonizing secret . The effect on the several different men was astonishingly similar . They began with polite listening expressions which deepened rapidly to surprise , pained embarrassment , then to utter restlessness . Their faces would freeze in strange smiles , their eyes would begin roaming in search of a way out . At last in some pause , or suddenly as if signaled from afar , they would break away , no matter how . Dr. Sacher never came near enough to hear what she was saying , but her gestures shocked him deeply , modest man that he was . She stroked her own breast and thigh , patted the face of her listener , laid her hand upon his heart . Yet the expression of her face was grief-stricken , her words seemed grave and hopeless . " Perhaps I am not young enough to attract her eye , " thought Dr. Sacher a little acidly . " I am no doubt much too far from the cradle for her , " but he decided deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful sense of time and its effects on the human organism , and he felt that man owed it to his dignity to live with philosophy within the limitations of his own time in the world . All other considerations aside , there was something scandalous and perverse in older persons , especially women , who at best showed symptoms of innate perversity , turning back to youth for sexual satisfactions : unnatural parents devouring their own young  --  a species of incest , to put a severe word upon it . . . . Well , he would see . It was obvious the woman suffered from some form of acute nervous disorder ; she should not he traveling alone , her situation as prisoner proved her irresponsibility , and she must be friendless indeed . That was the first , most dreadful effect of even a mild mental affliction , even a simple " breakdown " ? the loss of human love and sympathy , the literal alienation from the common life of one 's fellow-creatures . Madness , he considered , having never separated the practice of medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evil in the human soul ; he had never seen mania assume any but ignoble shapes . Let science do what it might , there was a mystery beyond fathoming in the human soul except in the light of divine revelation ; at the bottom of life there was an unanswerable riddle , and it is just there , concluded Dr. Sadler , his softened eyes still observing the Countess , where man leaves off , that God begins . T HE Countess disappeared , walking rather faster , around the upper end of the deck , and Dr. Sacher turned through the bar and emerged on the opposite side intending to approach her slowly . But three of the Cuban students left their shuffleboard at the sight of her , and swarmed abouther . She put on a new air for them , gentle . graceful , indulgent . They fell in step with her and with each other , and fairly outdid themselves in attentiveness to her . She was talking as they passed Dr. Sacher , and he caught a few words in her frail , complaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my children , my lovely ones , and they ran away to sleep in the woods . And I could only wait and suffer , suffer and wait  --  I could not lift a hand for them ? " Her hands flew up and described a whirling ring around her head . " But they were right to revolt , they were right , my sons , even if they die for it , even if I must be in exile .... " The students put on faces of exaggerated respect and melancholy , and she smiled at them blindly with frowning brows . One of the students fell back a pace and boldly , impudently , he winked at Dr. Sacher and swiftly tapped his forehead with a forefinger . He got in return a stare of such stony severity it abashed him somewhat and he made haste to catch up with his group . Dr. Sather looked at his watch and decided to lie down quietly for the rest of the afternoon . Lizzi Spifickenkieker and Herr Rieber were having a very fast game of Ping-pong , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They smashed the little ball back and forth over the net , crack , pop , pop , crack , their strokes speeding up shorter , faster , their faces darkening with blood , until both silently , grimly struck like automatons . It was a matter of life or death to win and they were smiling no longer . The Countess , with the three students who were singing " La Cucaracha , " bore down upon them suddenly , at Lizzi 's back , sailing by without a pause . Lizzi faltered , her eyes flashed aside , she missed , and the ball bounced after the retreating feet . " Ah , shame ! " she screamed , and running around the table she cracked the triumphant Herr Rieber over his bald head with her little paddle . " Ali , I should never have missed if that crazy woman and those crazy boys  --  they , they  --  oh , why must such things always happen to me ? " Herr Rieber ducked his head . Indulgently he soothed her : " Come now , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind so much , it is only a game . " " You can talk ! " cried Lizzi , lifting her paddle again . Deftly he seized her wrist , brought her hand down to his mouth , and printed a large juicy kiss upon it . " There now , " he said , " what a quick hand it is and it shall be much quicker the next time . Do n't mind not winning from me , I am the Pingpong champion of the Sportsverein in Mexico City . " " I can believe it , " said Lizzi , calming down a little . " I am not used to losing at this game . " Herr Richer instantly twinkled with immense meanings . " At what game do you lose ? " Lizzi shook his arm . " If you talk like that I shall leave you , " she threatened , tossing her head like an unmanageable mare . " No , I sha n't listen to such things or answer them . " " Clever girl , " cried Herr Rieber , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim , unless of course you want to beat me again , " he said with infinite slyness , " at Pingpong or any game at all ? " He squeezed her arm with such warmth that Lizzi blushed . " No , let 's swim , " she said , her voice rising , " we must have a race . " T T six o'clock a steward brought Dr. Sacher a message from the Countess , saving she was ill and must see him at once . A stewardess , waiting outside her door , knocked rather loudly when she saw the Doctor approaching , and moved as if to follow him in . " You may go , thank you , " said the Countess to the stewardess in a sharp , quiet voice , and the woman backed out at once , closing the door . The air of the cabin was thick with cigarette smoke , a mixture of heavy perfumes , and ether . Expensive-looking , badly worn luggage was spread about open , with shoes , evening wraps , improbable looking hats , wrinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumpled silk and velvet tumbling out on all sides in a confusion past ordinary remedy . The Countess was in bed , a faded pink satin bedgown falling off her shoulders , barely veiled in thin violet stuff . She sat up staring , opened her mouth without speaking , her clasped hands snapped apart and flew backward , forward , backward again , and she gasped at last , " You must help me ; I believe I am going to die . " Dr. Sacher summoned his calmest and most reassuring air , laid his palm on her forehead as if she were a child , and said , " I do n't think so , at least not just yet . " She bowed her head upon her raised knees and broke into a kind of sobbing , a crying complaining voice full of inarticulate words , but , Dr. Sacher observed , without tears . He sat beside her and began to remove various contrivances from the black instrument case he carried . She stopped crying and peered into its depths with instant curiosity . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about her bodily functions and she answered sensibly and plainly . When he asked her to take off her bedgown and lower her nightdress over her shoulders and back , she simply looked at him with a provocative flicker in her black eyes , and began to smile ; she sat quite still , smiling , while he removed them himself . She lifted her arms to help him with the sleeves , but that was all . H E COUNTED her pulse and listened to her heart and lungs , setting his ear to her breast and shoulder blades , noting her long thin delicate bones . He flashed small white lights into her eyes , and took her blood pressure . He caused her to breathe deeply and say oh and ah several times . He tapped her ribs front and back rather sharply with two fingers , kneaded her stomach in careful exploration , fetching a slight sigh from her . " Clench your fist , please , " he told her , and took some blood from the thin blue vein of her arm . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last with hands and shoulders flat , gazing at him as if she were hypnotized rather pleasurably , and said in an entirely changed voice , " All these charming attentions are making me deliciously sleepy , dear Doctor . Perhaps I only needed , a human touch after all those military police . They are very heavy-handed . " She breathed out lightly with her mouth open , and the smell of ether on her breath was very strong . The Doctor sniffed several times and leaned towards her concealing his moral disgust at his discovery . " You do n't need stimulants , " he said , gravely , taking back one of her wrists and holding it lightly , " nor narcotics , either . Whatever you need , " he said , his forehead gathering a frown , it is not ether . Why do you waste my time calling for me ? So far as I am able to see , you are not ill at all , " he told her ; " you are in enviably good condition , organically quite sound . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see , " she said . " Much too old . " " Perhaps fifty ? " " When you guess so well , " she said , " you deserve to be told you are right . Fifty , then . " " That does not seem so great an age to me now , " said Dr. Sather , " I should be pleased enough to be fifty again . " " Ah , I would not be a day younger for anything , " she said . " Relieve me , there is not one day of my dreadful life . . . or so I think now . What shall I do ? Where shall I go ? What is to become of me ? I am exiled , " she told him , " my husband is dead . . . my husband is dead , " she said again , sitting up , " thank God , but my two sons , my children , they arc fugitive somewhere , here , now , while we are talking , my sons . .. where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gives them food , where are they  --  when shall I ever see them again ? My house was burned too , " she went on in a lifeless voice as if she were reading a dull page aloud , " and my servants ran away , picking up things as they went  --  silver , money , clothes , anything  --  whatever they had coveted ; they scattered out of the gates like cattle . Every face I saw then was the face of someone who no longer looked at me as if I were a human being . . . . " Her hands began to dance , her lips drew back over her teeth , she struggled to sit up again and knocked the instrument case to the floor . " iii TALT , " said Dr. Sacher . He rose , picked up the black case , and began to prepare a small hypodermic needle . She became silent at once and watched him with her air of easily distracted attention . " This for tonight , " he explained , . ' only . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep it ? I shall take it away with me . " She motioned toward one of the sprawling pieces of luggage . " It is all there somewhere . " He pinched up the flesh of her arm , and at the slight stab of the needle she shuddered and said , " Ah , how delicious . How I love drugs , any kind of drug , I adore them all . You should praise me a little , because I donot , ever , take all the kinds of drug I should like . It would be so easy , so easy ? " She dropped back among the pillows , and Dr. Sachet- rummaged carefully among her things , bringing up a flask of ether . " Is this all ? " he asked . " I expect you to tell me the truth . " She prolonged her silence , waiting to be cajoled , but he said nothing more . He went over to the wash basin and emptied the flask , The fumes rose in his face and he coughed . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told her , " say what you please . " " Do n't scold , " she said , " you have not told me what is to become of me , with or without them . " " With your good health , " said Dr. Sacher , " I could wish you a little settled income and some reconciliation with society . And nothing more could happen . " " How dull , " she said blankly . " Maybe , " said Dr. Sacher , " for one of such specialized tastes . " " It is the difference between you and me , " she said . " It was not I who quarreled with society , but my sons . ? it was my sons who turned me out on this world . . . . Look , I have such good health , as you say . No income at all . A prisoner on her way to exile .. No doubt you have money in the bank , entire freedom , and your health is not so good . How right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Sacher , sitting beside her again . " Where is the rest of the ether ? " " You can see how useless it will be for you to give inc good advice , " she said , stroking his hand that lay on his knee near her . " But do n't stop giving it . Do n't go away . I love your good advice , I love to hear you scold and see you frown at me , as if you cared what happened to me . I should like being dull for a little while . I promise to stop taking ether , at least for this voyage . I do this for you , not for myself , I know I will begin again afterward . . . I tried everything , anything at all , in the end ether seemed best . A lovely excitement without pain . . . have you ever taken it ? " " No . " " You must try it sometime , " she said , in a drowned voice . " The other flask is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to sleep , " said Dr. Sacher , and he laid her hand back at her side . " 1 shall send the stewardess , and I shall see you again tomorrow . " " What is this heavenly drug I have now ? " she asked , her eyes closing . She smiled deeply and frowned . " I do n't recognize it . Is it something new ? " Dr. Sacher gave a short laugh , at which she opened her eyes and gave him a delighted look . " Do you expect me to tell you ? " he asked . " Very well , I must try to guess , or maybe you will give it to me again ... I adore you , " she said , " you are such a preposterous good moral dull ridiculous man , but charming , charming ! " She closed her eyes , lifted both hands and slowly stroked her small breasts upward , and her expression , especially about the mouth , quite startled Dr. Sacher . He shook her shoulder with careful violence . MAGAZINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stop that nonsense ! " Her hands fell back and her face turned to one side ; he could see she was falling asleep . He gathered up his black case in silence , stopped himself from saying , " Good night , " abruptly , and opened the door . T HE dank air of the passageway struck upon him as a fresh breeze after the fetid sweetness and rot of the cabin . He instructed the waiting stewardess and returned to his own quarters , feeling unpleasantly exhausted and freshly apprehensive about his own condition . He lay down and began to invite sleep , darkness , silence , the little truce of God between living and dying ; he put out of his mind , with deliberate intention to forget forever , the last words of that abandoned lost creature ; nettles , poisoned barbs , fishhooks , her words  --  the terrible malignance of the devil-possessed , the soul alienated from its kind .
