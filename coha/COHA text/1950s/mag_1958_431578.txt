 | THE ENGLISH DISEASE Its symptoms are the slogan " I could n't care less " plus a paralyzing kind of politeness . . . its causes seem to be boredom with " The Humbug State " and a helpless feeling that Britain is sliding downhill ... . A clinical report by a London editor , who believes his patient 's condition is critical but not hopeless . I T COMES as a shock each time you hear the phrase . A German businessman in the bar of the Atlantic Hotel in Hamburg uses it contemptuously as he describes how he beat an English competitor to an order . " Not typical , " you murmur . A Swiss visitor mutters it as he looks at the cracked cups and the tea-swill in a station cafeteria in Manchester . " Ah , but you should go to the new espresso coffee bars . . . " you begin to correct him . An American journalist introduces it into a lunch-time discussion about John Osborne 's plays , " No , " you start to say , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . we can still invent , produce , trade , write , paint ... we still have something to say in the world , something useful to do . . . the Viscount aircraft , the nuclear power station at Calder Hall , Benjamin Britten , the Health Service , Graham Greene , independence for Ghana and Malaya .... " And then you stop short . Have n't you just been saying that politics have become a bore , that the theater is ( lying , that English industry is monopoly-minded , unimaginative . . . ? Of course . Were n't you just talking of that TV program you wrote on " The Future of Britain " and remarking how much easier it was to find pessimists than optimists ? Certainly . Then why do you resent it when a foreigner comes to the @# same conclusion ? Is he really wrong in arguing that we are fast becoming a nation of also-rans , sorry for ourselves , but just comfortable enough to do nothing about it ? It is a strange state of mind . We almost believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaps , after all , and this is a good country to live in ? but then half of us , privately , confess to the opinion pollster that at one time or another we have thought about emigrating . We write , and read , solemn articles that insist that we still count as a world power ? then we almost wreck the Commonwealth , cause trouble with our American allies , and expose our own military weakness in the effort to prove it by a futile demonstration against Nasser . We read the headlines that chronicle our descent from greatness ? and turn from them with a yawn to chuck our football pool coupons or blur our minds and our eyes on the 17-inch telly . We are always ready to give other nations lessons on democracy ? but we let our parties become closed oligarchies , we let our civil liberties be corroded , and every week we find new totems and taboos to buttress our cult of monarchy . We talk about winning the battle for the pound ? but our industrialists are as much interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our workers say that the way prices keep going up it 's time the union put in a claim for another ten bob a week . We hold up our hands in horror at the fearful goings-on in Little Rock ? but our bus crews in Birmingham threaten to strike if any more West Indians are hired , and our government interns thousands of Kenya Africans without trial . We English are bored and restless , cynical and complacent : we lean on our spades , watch the clock , blame the bosses , blame the unions , envy the Americans , worry about the Germans , distrust the Russians ; we write off  | our politicians as pompous self-seekers , dismiss our priests as old fogies , make popular idols of our quiz-winners , shrug our shoulders at the world going to hell around us ? and we do n't give a damn . SYMPTOMS AND GUILT T HAT , surely , is the peculiar quality of our crime against ourselves and our children : we know , but we are indifferent . A Soviet novelist ? I can well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book called The Revolt of the Indifferent . " Do not fear your friends , " he said . " They can only betray you . Do not fear your enemies . They can only defeat you . But fear the indifferent , for their indifference makes it possible for your friends to betray you and your enemies to defeat you . " Now a Communist society forces indifference upon the mass of the population as an act of policy . It is almost a social virtue : if you are indifferent , and work hard , you get a medal or a holiday at a rest home or a larger apartment . The only condition is that you do not ask nasty questions or otherwise make life difficult for the party bosses who remain bosses because you are indifferent . But we have not had indifference thrust upon us : we have acquired it , and we accept it because it makes much less trouble , not for others , but for ourselves . Why bother ? The question is the first symptom of the disease . Yet we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep sense of guilt about it . ( This , I take it , is why we resent the German businessman , the Swiss visitor . the American journalist . ) And we project that guilt upon our neighbors . " Why should I cut out my tea-break to finish a rush order ? " asks a factory worker . " My boss takes two hours for lunch . " The disillusioned teacher who has to cope with a class of forty children in a school long overdue for demolition : " Why should I make the extra effort for the more backward children ? If only the council would give us enough staff and adequate equipment I could manage it . " A doctor who has left hospital work to advise a drug company : " The pay was terrible , my promotion prospects poor , , the conditions impossible . But I 'm not leaving for the money . They obviously do n't want decent doctors . " And a final example I know ? this one a young architect of ability who took a useful but not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it up , and is now earning a large salary designing hideous brick boxes for a speculative builder . " Nobody was interested an more , " he said . " Why should I sacrifice myself for the Britain beautiful when no one seems to want to live in it ? " Why , indeed ? This is a failure of morale . Ain I my brother 's timekeeper , his teacher , his healer , his town planner ? Not any more , it seems . Why , when he does not want me ? I do not give up because I am betrayed or defeated , but because no one cares . Even the words " betrayal " and " defeat " imply a cause , but when no one cares there are no causes . We fight our sham battles , and go through the drill we learned when we thought the causes mattered . We scarcely deceive ourselves that we know what the battles are about . Tweedledum and Tweedledee are our generals and as they go at it with their pots and pans we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we choose to seek them out . There is a very simple but fundamental one ? our own economic survival . Once again , we know the facts : we need to produce more , to design better , to sell more aggressively , to consume less and invest more , to clear away the restrictive practices of both business and the unions , to modernize our machines and overhaul our labor-management relations . Once again , indifference : we are doing nicely , thank you , and please close the door gently as you go out in case you shake down the cobwebs . Why ? A nation needs a dream to unite it . And our dream is of the past , not the future . We know what we were ? not what we are , or what we wish to become . We stumble forward blindly because we look over our shoulders . Germans do not look back ? there are only ruins , cruelty , defeat ; Russians do not look back ? the future can not be worse than the past ; Americans do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . But we look back , because then we could believe in ourselves . Our ruling class was secure : it believed in God , the King , and the Empire , the wickedness of trade unions , and the righteousness of property . Our middle class had its ambitions , and the creature comforts that went with world power , cheap labor at home , and even cheaper labor in die colonies . And our working class knew it was ill-used , exploited , denied its rights ? and , in its poverty and impotence , it could believe iii the New Jerusalem . Suddenly , it was all meaningless . Six years of war , and six years of the Labor government , destroyed that society for good . And in its place it put a social stalemate , a caucus race without  | , neat rewards or punishments , but with small prizes for everybody ? the expense account for the businessman , the washing machine for the housewife , the television set for the worker , the prestige jobs for members of the old ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine for the middle class , and , for all of us , what John Osborne calls " the wave of a gloved hand from the golden coach . " THE NEW ESTABLISHMENT W E ONCE took the monarchy for granted . Why have some of us now taken it as a target ? Because it is the central symbol of the new Establishment . It is benign ? and utterly irrelevant to anything that matters . Round it cluster the modern Barnacles of all the Circumlocution Offices ? the masters of the soft phrase and the indecisive policy , the directors of radio and television programs , most of our politicians , our editors , even our industrialists and trade union leaders . We have all arrived , and as W. S. Gilbert 's Duke of PlazaToro pointed out , " When everyone is somebody , then no one 's anybody . " The Barnacles have another debt to the Duke : he taught them the great advantage of leading an army from behind ? a position that suits the Barnacles since they are looking backwards in any case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have helped us organize our lives so that nothing can happen . A Socialist , my dear fellow ? Tut , tut . You 'll never get anywhere : we all have too much to lose . A Tory ? Dear me , how extreme , and how old-fashioned . Do n't you know , old chap , that the trade unions run the show now ? A Liberal ? Ah , that 's better . Just stand over there and hold a quiet meeting about home rule for Scotland , or tax reform , or industrial co-partnership . Nobody will bother you : nobody will even listen . What did you say about Suez ? Yes , most regrettable . The Americans let us down , you know , and Sir Anthony was a bit under the weather at the time . Oh , capital punishment ? Well , we fixed that up : we sha n't actually hang anyone , but we must keep the principle for crimes that no one commits . Leaves the trap open , if you 'll forgive the phrase . Prostitutes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with heavy fines , and we can have a nice , clean , cozy call-girl racket . Old-age pensioners , did you say ? Slum schools , overcrowded hospitals , industrial stagnation , subtopia sprawling into the countryside ? Now , now , all those things are coming along quite nicely , and you must be patient . After all , we have our little troubles , and with this economic crisis , you know , we must all make our sacrifices . . . Oh , excuse me , I must go and have a word with that troublesome fellow . He keeps coming here and insisting that we do something ... . No wonder that Jimmy Porter in Look Back in Anger cries out for at least a " good loud bloody damn ! " This is the Humbug State , bristling with chromium-plated safety valves . And they are not even needed . We shall hedge ,  | qualify , compromise , rub off the sharp edges to life , forget what it is like to hate or love passionately , praise honestly or condemn with conviction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech a gross indiscretion . We have become genteel . Of course , we always hankered after gentility . It is only in the last few years that we have managed , so to speak , to make it one of the unwritten conventions of our social constitution . And , it may be , it reflects only a passing phase . Ten years from now , perhaps , we shall wonder how we could drift so complacently through the nineteen-fifties , bowing and scraping to each other in a ritual that is utterly irrelevant to the world of the H-bomb , the sputnik , automation , Arab nationalism , and all the other jokers in the pack . THE CYCLE OF DECLINE W H Y are we in this condition ? ( I say " we " because this is a condition you can find at all social levels ? the businessman and the union organizer , the Labor party stalwart and the Conservative party member , the writer , the civil servant , the scientist , and the shopkeeper . ) Is it a form of psychic exhaustion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A little , perhaps . Is it due to a rejection of responsibility , a feeling of helplessness , the loss of a sense of destiny ? because the control of destiny has somehow passed from our keeping into other hands ? A little of that , too . Is it one of those mysterious afflictions which seem to plague nations that are on the way down ? so that a Goth in the fourth century might have spoken with contempt of the " Roman Disease , " or a seventeenth-century Englishman could have talked of the " Spanish Disease " Perhaps , but we do not know what starts off the cycle of decline , nor why people who see it starting prove powerless to arrest it . So that line of reasoning leads nowhere ; at least , it leads to resignation rather than to action . Yet it is too soon to be resigned , though it may soon be too late to act . And so we English hover at the turning point , torn by uncertainty and indecision , publicly assuring ourselves that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the more odorous of our social mothballs ! ) and privately confessing our doubts and discontents , insisting that we shall yet reap rich harvests , and meanwhile making ourselves comfortable by feasting on the seed corn , knowing secretly that much of the past was intolerable . fearing that much of the future will be unbearable , and feeling guilty because the present , it unexciting , is both tolerable and bearable . Perhaps the key lies in the phrase " turning point , " for this country is going through a slow and painful process of adjustment ? externally . adjustment to a world in which we shall speak when we are spoken to , and perhaps speak third or fourth or fifth in turn ; internally , to a society without great differences of wealth or class , in which the familiar signposts of status have been torn down . Because we once were rich , powerful . class-conscious , we still use the old vocabulary to describe ourselves , though the substance has died within the shell of words . This is a society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dusk or dawn , where the old is too strong to die and the new too weak to be born . It is tempting to put this into the neat boxes of politics : i.e. , the Tories want the past , and Labor wants the future . But this is only a halftruth . In some ways , both our main parties are conservative , prisoners of their own history . That is one reason why people are cynical about politics , and why they distrust politicians who talk as if the world were still England 's oyster , as if all we need to legislate ourselves into a hygienic paradise is another pension scheme , or a housing program , or some other nostrum . We need a fresh start , a new image which explains how we can live in a world where our influence daily diminishes and our economic resources are shrinking to the point of crisis . If we can discover that image , we shall have causes enough , challenge enough , excitement and emotions to match it . Whether we discover it depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack of palsy or the first onset of permanent paralysis .
