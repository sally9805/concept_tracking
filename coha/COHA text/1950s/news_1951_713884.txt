txt A thirteen-minute test of the 526 fixed air-raid sirens atop buildings in key sections of the city , augmented by hundreds of Police and Fire Department mobile sirens , was held at noon yesterday . The test showed the signals were clearly audible in the lower and most of the midtown areas , but some sections of Manhattan , Queens , Brooklyn and the Bronx had " blind " or " dead " spots in which the warnings either were faint or were not heard at all . Arthur W. Wallander , City Director of Civil Defense , said his office considered the test a success . He promised that the blind spots would be eliminated as quickly as possible . Mayor Impellitteri. who listened to the test at City Hall , where he found it effective , agreed with Mr. Wallander that it was an improvement over the one made on Jan. 27 . At that time , when the city tested its 214 fixed and mobile sirens , many areas were found in which the signals could not be heard . Mr. Wallander said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday . He reported that of the 526 fixed sirens in the test , eighteen had not functioned because of mechanical or electrical failure . Dead ' and ' Weak ' Spots Found Complaints from residents , he said , indicated " dead and weak spots ' ' in the following areas : Manhattan  --  Morton Street , Greenwich Village ; Thirty-first Street and Madison Avenue ; Eightyeighth Street and West End Avenue ; Ninety-fourth Street and Riverside Drive , Brooklyn  --  Avenue R and Bedford Avenue ; Avenue M and Ocean Parkway ; Court Street area ; Todd-Erie Basin . Queens  --  Weak spots in Woodside . Bronx ? No signal heard at Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse , where traffic is noisy ; siren was faint at Fordham and Kingshridge Roads . Most New Yorkers did not seem to be disturbed by the test . police , fire department and civil defense aides agreed . Pedestrians went about their normal duties while the sirens sounded , having been warned in advance by newspapers and the radio that the signals were to be only a test . There likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Norwegian Air Force , who were walking through Times Square at the time , thought the signals were real . As soon as the first wail was heard , the three  --  Erik Schistad , ' elt Knudsen and Ottar Sabo  --  ran into the foyer of the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway . " Why did you run : ? they were asked . " We did n't know there was a test . " one of them replied . " We thought it was real . " The siren test caused a less serious reaction in another quarter . It disrupted for upwards of fifteen minutes the Selective Service College Qualification examination being taken by students at Columbia University . The siren for the Morningside Heights area is atop University Hall on the campus . Three floors below , 750 young men were taking the test . Most of the students had sufficient time to finish their work , but some complained that as a result of the siren 's screams , they had lost as much as ten minutes of the three-hour examination period . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but once the alarm got well under way , talk spread through the room . Similar reports came from elsewhere in the university area where an additional 600 students were taking the examination . The failure of the eighteen sirens was explained by Mr. Wallander , who said the Department of Public Works did not have enough personnel to maintain all the sirens properly . This condition , he indicated , would be corrected by July 1 , when a private maintenance firm is scheduled to take over service of the sirens . Mr. Wallander cruised in his automobile during the test . Walter Detmar , director of building management , Department of Public Works , was stationed at Forty-second Street and the Avenue of the Americas with a decibel meter to record the volume of sound . He said that at that point the results were " exceptionally good . " The noise level prior to the test was 75 to 80 decibles , but during the test the decible meter reading rose to 94 , and at one time to 98 . During the test a police radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busstop at Broadway and Wall Street . While Patrolman John O'Shea remained in the car attending its siren , his partner , James , stuck his head out the window to listen to the fixed sirens and make sure the radio car signal was being sounded . Sirens used in the test included twenty-two of forty horsepower , one of fifteen horsepower , 421 of five horsepower and twenty-eight of two horsepower . Mr. Wallender said fifty-four additional fixed sirens were to be installed and that these would be placed in the " dead " and " weak " areas . Of the fifty-four , he said , nine would be forty-horsepower sirens , thirtyeight of five horsepower and seven of two horsepower . Twenty additional sirens are being held in reserve . In the tests to be held henceforth every Saturday noon , decibel meters will be used to determine if the blind spots are being eradicated . Mr. Wallander said he expected a report this week from a special committee on the removal of the ban on sirens on emergency vehicles . The ban will be lifted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds of the fixed air-raid sirens and those on the emergency vehicles , including police cars , fire engines and ambulances .
