For the citizens of Nevada , electing candidates to the state university 's five-man Board of Regents is usually quite a routine affair . Until last week , this year 's election promised to be no different . Then , just before the deadline for filing , two new candidates appeared . One was a 21-year-old sophomore named Walter MacKenzie . The other : big , bluff Joe Sheeket-ski , 45 , the football coach . <P> Sophomore MacKenzie seemed to have no overpowering reason for wanting to be a regent , but Coach Sheeketski did , A onetime Notre Dame star halfback ( 1931-32 ) , he had gone on to coaching at Holy Cross , served with the FBI during World War II , arrived at Nevada in 1947 . There he did well . He got enough money from the Reno Downtown Boosters Club to attract some first-rate players , was able to launch Nevada into big-time football . <P> But this year the regents began to complain . The Boosters had fallen $48,000 behind on the team 's room &; board bill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheeketski : " You ca n't play big-league football with pennies . " He also thought that the university coufd show " a little extra consideration " for its athletes in academic matters . <P> In announcing his candidacy last week Coach Sheeketski offered a simple platform : put Nevada 's athletic program " on a sound business basis . . . Any legal voting resident of Nevada is eligible to run for regent . The law does n't set up any exceptions . " <P> Incumbent Regent Albert Hilliard , a Reno attorney up for reelection , thought otherwise . As a university employee , he argued , Sheeketski had no right to run . Otherwise , members of the faculty would also feel able to run for regent , and the result would be " complete confusion . " He said he would move to have Sheeketski dismissed as coach . <P> Coach Sheeketski stuck to his guns . Said he : " I 'm in the regents ' race for keeps , but I intend to play it fair . I learned that from Knute Rockne and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . "
