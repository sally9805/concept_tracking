txt The city-owned transit system 's operating deficit for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1951 , was $3,067,520 , an increase of $1,861,476 over the previous year . In a business that takes in $216 , - 432,804 , or nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in a year , this may seem on casual inspection to be coming pretty close to breaking even on a public enterprise that is not intended to make a profit . Of course it is necessary to look beyond the mere operational figures . The taxpayer , besides having to make up this $3,067,520 , shoulders an annual debt service burden of $63,000,000 or so , for borrowing in the distant or immediate past for transit construction or new equipment . This debt service figure promises to grow . It is a common fallacy when looking at transit statistics to assume that , because revenues have not kept pace with expenditures , fare increases of the past were a mistake . It would be more to the point to consider how much worse off we might have been if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 1 , 1950 . Those who argue against fare rises are prone to forget that'labor costs in transit keep going up , and that they more than swallow up the fare rise revenues . Operating revenues increased $10,010,424 last year ; salaries and wages increased $13,761,602 . All city-owned transit ( rapid and surface ) carried 2,225,736,627 passengers in the year 1950-51 , a decline of 108,670,642 , or 4.66 per cent , from 1949-50 . Rapid transit alone ( subways and elevated ) carried 1,635,728,973 , a decline of 45,114,769 , or 2.68 per cent from the year before . Surface lines , largely a bus operation , carried 590 , - 007,654 , a decline of 63,555,873 , or 9.72 per cent . The increase of three cents paid for a transfer , effective July 1 , 1950 , was chiefly responsible for the better revenue showing in the face of falling traffic . We do n't know whether City Hall is aware of it , but the city faces a most serious financial situation in transit this year because of the expensive transition to the forty-hour week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , but authoritative estimates place the added cost for the shorter work-week during this year at $25,000 , - 000 to $28,000,000 . This would suggest a possible transit operating deficit of $30,000,000 this year . We warned repeatedly , in advance of the July 1 legal deadline for raising the fare , that the city should anticipate this labor cost . Mayor Impellitteri and the Board of Estimate ignored such warnings . But they will find that the higher taxes they will have to impose in lieu of a higher fare to meet this transit deficit and other increased city costs will - be no less bitter a pill for the public to swallow , or for public officials to administer . The city should ask the Legislature at the earliest possible moment to remove the legal restriction ' that makes July 1 the only day of the year when a fare change can be effected .
