A regular contributor to the ATLANTIC in his middle years and best remembered for " The Bee 's knees , " " The Breath of Life , " and other nature studies , most of which were written in Wisconsin , CHARLES D. STEWART now has a rather embarrassing question to ash of Edgar Allan Poe . Jr YOU have read Charles Dickens ' interesting novel Burnaby Budge , you will recall that poor Barnaby-had a pet raven named Grip . The raven was almost a part of Barnaby because Barnaby carried the bird in a cage on hit back . Thus Grip went along when Barnaby Was thrown into New-gate prison at the time of the Gordon riots . The bird , having a somewhat limited vocabulary , WaS constantly repeating himself , and one of his favorite statements was , " I 'm a devil ; Pm a devil . " As Dickens tells it , Grip would sometimes combine the phrase with another , saying , " Polly put the kettle on ? I 'm a devil , I 'm a devil . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bin poem " The Raven . " Beginning with the fifteenth stanza he says , " ' Prophet ! ' said I , thing of evil ! ? prophet still , if bird or devil ! ? ' and at the beginning of the next stanza , as if for emphasis , he repeats the line . Dickens calls attention to the brig/3i red shining in Grip 's eye as boy and bird sit in their prison cell , looking out at the light from the burningbuildings . " As if , ? Dickens says , " it were a spark from the fires of the Gordon riots . " Poe , sitting in his dreary chamber at midnight , had little illumination . The fire in the fireplace had almost gone out . " And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor . " There was a lamp above the Mist of Pallas upon which the raven sat ? such a meager flame as lamps gave before the days of kerosene . There was not much light there ? hardly anything " fiery " ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up at the visiting fowl " whose fiery eyes 110W burned into soy bosom 's core . " From u hat source of fire or conflagration would these fiery eyes get such notable reflection ? It would seem here that Poe was thinking more about Barnaby 's bird than the one he was writing about . Poc said that the fascinating quality of his visiting raven was due to its prophetic nature ? a brainless bird giving an answer that fit right in with the question asked , and especially an answer with such a doleful future as " Nevermore . " Barnaby 's mother sat with him during much of the time that he spent behind the bars . She expressed the hope that they would soon be given their freedom . " You hope , " said Barnaby . " Ay , but your hoping will not undo these chains . I hope , but they do not mind that . Grip hopes , but who cares for Grip ? " The raven gave a short melancholy croak . It said " Nobody " as plainly asa croak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But who cares for Grip ? " Again the raven answered " Nobody . " " Nobody " and " Never " were among his favorite words . Here then we have that same prophetic quality and the same doleful meaning coming from a brainless bird which Poe , in his essay on " The Raven , " said ' was on necessary to the success of his poem . Hose are tee going to account for these coincidences between Dickens ' novel , published in 1841 , and Poe 's " The Raven , " which came out on January 29 , 1845 ? Coincidences are just chance , and they hardly ocr so often in such short space . As yet we shall ll not accuse Poe of plagiarism . He himself accused too many of plagiarism . He seas noted for finding literary thieves and liars to right and left of limns , and he made many enemies thereby . He summed as his activity in that line by speaking of " Longfellow and other plagiarists . " And New England retaliated by calling him " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood them might he that Poe would take ideas from Dickens , and especially from &anal?),; Budge . Poe knew m was about the novel than anyone else living , so it as said . The Encyclopedia Britannic. , eleventh edition , under the heading " Charles Dickens , " tells us : " The plot of Barnaby Rorke is of the ut-mt complexity ; and Edgar Allan Poe , who pre-dictosed the conclusion , must be one of the few per-sons who ever really mastered it . " As the novel came out serially in an American publication , Pm ; attracted much attention when he successfully predicted , from early numbers , the course and outcome of the story . He seas there-for deeply familiar with every detail of the pas-sages about Grip , Barnaby 's raven . When the book came out , Poe reviewed it . In the review he shows evidence of being much impressed by the raven . He said , " The raven , too , intensely amusing as it is , might have been made , more than we now Nee it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its eroakings might have been prophetically heard in the course of the drama . " ( 111hc italics arc Poe 's . ) So now What have we ? We have l'oe , sometime before he wrote the poem , beginning to have ideas . The two vital and funcluncntal ideas of the poem are here quite explicitly expressed ? the ideas of having a brainless bird Who could give answem that would happen to lit ire with the ques-tion asked and that would strike the imagination as being prophetic . And then a word of a doleful nature . Dickens provided such words . Grip 's favorite words were " Never " and " Nobody . " POC made his ravcigs " Nevermore . " They were both prophetic in their use . Shall we accuse Poe of plagiarism ? To he sure of our work wc must look into it a little more deeply . In 1845 " The Raven " made its appearance in the New York &ening; illirror . It soon became the best-known pocm in America . When " The Rata , " was an established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the review he undertook to explain to the public that every idea , every line of the poem . seemingly inspired , was a work of pure reason . Each step was thought out . Jr was shrewdly devised . It was an achievement of intellect . He had calculated the effect of each word and sound and image . The poem was not the result of mysterious inward promo tings or suggestion from without ; this he is careful to have you understand . And this , it would seem , is his reason 11ne writing a review of the poem himself . It is a sort of confusion to the public of how such things am done . fits thorouglincss in implanting this point of view is interestingly exhibited in the no-called re-.He starts with the word " Nevermore " and the effect to be worked by its reiteration . And so problem number one is to choose a speaker . First he thought of using a human being , but decided that it would not do to use a reasoning creature . The effect of brainless reiteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parrot and thought thatover . It would not do ; he said it was " unnatural . " Then he his upon the idea of using the raven ; he said it mat " equally capable of speech with the parrot " and " infinitely in keeping with the intended tone . " Thus he goes on with his review , or confession , and never once mentions the raven with which he became in familiar in reviewing Barnaby Ridge . Now , must we force ourselves to believe that never at any moment while he was writing " The Raven , " and then writing his review of " The Raven , " did he recall that other raven named Grip ? Did he forget what he had observed in carefully in Barnaby 's bird : the effect of prophecy that could be achieved by the reiterated word ? Did he never think of Grip 's words " Never " and " Nobody " and compare them with his own " Nevermore " ? Would it be possible ; for a man with any memory at all to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then forget all about is Did Poe forget that Barnaby 's bird was repeatedly calling himself a devil , and that he , Poe , made his own bird a visitor front the nether regions ? Was all this in far gone from Poe 's mind that when it came to choosing a mouthpiece for " Nevermore " he had to think it all out ? first a human being , then a parrot , and finally , at last , a raven ? Poe had made quite a reputation by attacking other writers as plagiarists . Now that his nhal poem a great success he would naturally be-gin to was feel uneasy . He would want nothing that might he called plagiarism attached to that . And so what would he do ? He would head it all off by writing a so-called review of his own poem . He would be careful not to say a word about Barnaby Midge . Poe was a detective in the sense that he was the originator of the detective story . He would now use his craft in throwing literary detectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detective has a culprit in hand , the wrongdoer will keep away as far as possible from the object of the search . A detective is often able to tell by little moves of the culprit 's hand or arm , little opposed pressures which the detective can feel , just where the object is . That is just what Poe is doing in this so-called review . He is keeping the public mind as far as possible from Barnaby Rudge 's raven . Mr. Poe accuses himself of plagiarism . The : Monne Monthly big letters on the front pane of the unfamiliar newspapers drooping like flags at half-mast from their wooden spines . Reading the dogmatic head-lines patrolled by exclamation marks , I could think only of details unmentioned here : a policeman smiling dreadfully on a doorstep where he WaS not welcome ; a ragged toothless old woman mending a useless chair beside a wrecked tank ; the smell of human sweat and of horses ' , the former mom acid , the latter more pungent ; the crackling and of burning and the sensation of smarting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a " long-expected uprising " about which everything was clear at a first reading ? but less so at a second one Long expected by whom ? By " all thinking people " said one paper , in an article illustrated by a photograph of crowds shaking their fists . " That 's the spirit " was the caption uncles this . " The eyes of the workl " were upon us , stated another paper . Looking round the room I felt fiercely glad of the players ' absorption in their chessmen of the look of complicity the barman gave his glasses , of the yellow-eyed boy 's careful polishing of the leaves of all these evidences of private preoccupations . Boris remarked that we 'd better check on happenings at our billets . It was just after passing the royal stables , which Boris pointed out to me with pride ? nothing concerning animals is alien to him ? that we collided with Ladislaus , carrying a rucksack and looking wretched . Seeing us he turned first red , then white , and began shouting greetings and slapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him , while he was asking us . Shaking his head and running his hands over his elbows , Ladislaus said that on " that morning " ? already these words held particular significance fors until the next disaster we would date events in our lives as before or after " that morning " ? on that morning , then , Ladislaus had stayed home late to watch his cactus , one that flowers only every four years and was due to do so around then . Ladislaus had for this plant the feelings of both a lover and a policeman , and when at last he had to go out , to pick up tickets for the Saturday football game , he 'd run all the way . Yes , the streets had been a bit emptier than usual . But he had n't paid too much attention to this at the time , what with the cactus and the football game . Ladislaus pauses ! , shook his head gloomily , said , " it 's probably flowering now , " tugged at his right ear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Then he went back to yesterday , when he had found the ticket office shut , which it had no buSinest to he at that hour , and as he ran home he noticed a shop with a broken window , no immediately crossed the street , became thanks to the cur-rent obsession with juvenile delinquency anyone under twenty needs to watch other people 's steps . On the may he had run into our chemistry master , who had collected half a dozen boys and urged Ladislaus to join them . At the time he had n't been quite clear what it was all about . But now here he was . " I always act without thinking , " he concluded sadly . " Not this time , you did n't , " said Boris . OUR lavatory window was still open , and Aunt Natasha and I got back to the main room without our absence rousing more than a few suspicious glances from persons who feared we might have been securing advantages . Once one is a refugee , one starts developing an exaggerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in myself . I would have gone to any lengths to secure an advantage , however unfairly , for Aunt Natasha . A Red Cross woman came and asked if we were all vaccinated . By chance , Aunt Natasha and I had been done recently and , before going to the Racnik , I 'd put the certificates in my purse on the you-never-can-tell principle . Some people immediately bared their arms and held them out , others cried that it was not their fault , others simply cried . Although vaccination is compulsory at home , some of the peasants still try to evade it on the grounds that it is the mark of the beast . The dogs barked , and an old woman exclaimed in a plummy but resonant voice that God would punish them and us , nodding to herself as if she found this very satisfactory . Rumors began spreading like circles round the spot where a stone has dropped into a pond . The room grew stuffy with fear . People hurled questions at their neighbors but went on talking through the answers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , they had been taught a lesson , An emotional voice expressed a wish to go home and spoke of rats and sinking ships , whereupon an even more emotional voice flared up and said , " Speak for yourse/f , " and the words " Huns , Mongolians , Tartars , barbarians " flew through the air like shapes of things to come . just then a siren went off , making Us jump and clutch each other . Feeling in her pocket , Aunt Natasha found a piece of bread and pressed it into my hands . " Have you noticed that one 's appetite grows , as food gets scarcer ? I do n't know why people are constantly extolling nature 's way . " " But we 've had a lot to eat here . " " That wo n't last . " " Why not ? " I asked stupidly , trying not to listen for the bombs I expected to follow the siren . " Because people soon get tired of refugees . The pattern seldom varies . First welcoming looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered . They not only mean but leant to wash our feet . But if crises last too long , if there are too many of us for existing charitable organizations ? and there always are ? then refugees are suddenly discovered to be ungrateful and given to intrigues . And of course we often are . We start by bringing out the best in some people , and end by bringing out the worst in everyone . I did n't tell you this before , because back home it would have caused you nothing but nagging regret , but do remember now that whenever they close frontiers and stop individual travel , voluntary travel , which produces pleasure and commerce , then the next thing is mass involuntary travel ? refugees ? which produces only trouble . Look at us . " The siren was mute now , and no bomb had fallen within earshot . Suddenly a door was slammed , footsteps rattled down the passage , hands were clapped , and a harassed voice said , " All together , please ! Together . Do n't let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half an hour . " The voice continued explaining , but I stopped listening . Aunt Natasha was right . They were tired of us already , and although they were not responsible for our plight I felt angry , which I had n't yesterday : angry and frightened , and therefore eager to be unfair . The first stage of our outward journey was accomplished , and I was no longer an innocent traveler . HUDDLED outside was a crowd of people in clothes that , though of different shades , now looked predominantly dun-gray . White-knuckled hands clutched nervously at suitcases , bundles , rucksacks , and baskets , and distress made every face angular . An ollicia/ voice , as rational as its owner 's uniform , explained that we were only being transferred to the other side of town because these premises were actually needed for incoming refugees ; things must be organized in stages , the screening process , buses will be provided , now will everyone just cooperate ? But the voice 's moderntion was powerless against the tornado of rumors . Next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " They 're going to send us hark . " Immediately , a long-chinned neighbor contradicted her . " To a camp , more likely , " she said , then added briskly , as if deriving gratification from her own bitterness , " I knew we should n't escape . All my family 've died in camps . We 're intended for the crematorium , all right . " At the word " crematorium " the weeping woman gave the begin- sling of a thin scream , but quickly popped rheumatism-twisted hand over her mouth . " Nothing personal intended , " grumbled the woman whose family had died in camps . " What kind of talk is that ? " asked a dog owner . " Why exaggerate ? So ungrateful . Enough to provoke destiny . " An argument started . But instead of spreading , as it usually does in crowds ? those who know nothing about the matter under discussion being the most vociferous ? this was restricted to half a dozen voices . The rest of us merely pressed closer together , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , and I told myself that if I could count them before the return of the uniformed woman , who had gone indoors to look for a missing nmber , then every-thing would be all right , I knuew nothing could make everything all right , but this did not prevent my being relieved when I won my bet with myself . At last two big blue autocars drove round the corner , stopping in front of us . Instinctively see all drew back , as if these vehicles were dangerous animals crowned with luggage racks . Along the autocars/ smooth blue sides were metal letters , the words " tours " and " Venice " catching the light . As we climbed into the second one I asked Aunt Natasha if she had ever been to Venice , and she nodded . " One 's eyes are never hungry there ; churches like great pearls , trees springing out of marble , the sound of water lapping against stone and , in the autumn , the taste of mushrooms and walnuts and cheese ? the Venetians used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , I whispered , " Maybe we 'll go there together one clay ? " " We 're moving its the right direction . But , " looking worried , " Venice is not a good place for horses . Even the fire engines are motorboats . " We were driving through what seemed to be back streets . There was scarcely snore milli ' , titan at /sonic and , here and them , lingers of grass showed betycen cobbles , wisps of straw blew out from wooden doorways , and a group of children stopped singing " Ringel , Riegel , Rosenkrantz " to stare as we passed . Then back to macadamized surfaces , traffic stagnant between clifflike warehouses . Next cattle more shops , well-covered women carrying baskets , ancl the road widening into a huge statued Platt with a great church spiring up on the other side , its roof grass-greets . Sunlight had made way for grayness , and it seas evening when at last we stopped in a narrow street of brick houses , old-fashioned rather than old , with nibbled stucco around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and were marshaled into it hall decorated with photographs of men its frock coats and commanding attitudes . There were also several notice boards . Even without these , one would have known this was a school from the smell of chlorine , chalk , and stale clothes . The room wier , WC were to sleep Was very large , and contained army blankets as well as straw . Having arranged . ours , Aunt Natasha and I sat down and did what Elsa 's father caller ' casing the joint . Wooden bars striped the opposite wall , and in front of them stood a vaulting horse , a springboard , and a basket of Indian clubs . Ropes hanging from the ceiling were looped to the walls . I hoped we should n't be awakened try gyrating athletes . Suddenly my heart missed a beat . " Did we leave the schnapps in our broom cupboard ? " Aunt Natasha patted her coat . Reassured , my thoughts returned to her past . As we waited for cabbage soup , the smell of which was drifting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you sec Boris again between your marriages ? " " But of course . I saw him again soon after my first marriage  --  and realized I had made a terrible mistake . But by then I had grown up enough to know my own foolishness toes to blame , not my kind old husband . I had grown very fond of Anton . He allowed me to carry out all my plans for our peasants  - -  -  which was more than they themselves did ? and even took rim traveling , which meant many sacrifices from a sportsniatt 's point of view , although of course our itineraries included a certain amount of animal slaughter . " " But Boris ? " " Still in the army . We had parted sorrowfully yet pleased with ourselves . When one 's young , one can get a great deal of satisfaction out of an au itude , providing one 's not Imogry . Later on it seetned impossible that I had n't missed Boris , but at the time I was n't dissatisfied with what I had . Inside lire close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates ? and I did n't hate Anton . I cattle to have the tenderest feelings for him , and I shall newr forget his gentleness when my mother died . " " You mean my grandmother ? " " No , my fathermarried again . Your grand-mother was his second wife , Maria . " " Did you know her ? " " Very well . Asa girl I greatly admired her . She was the daughter of Clzeell friends of ours ? their counti y was still part of the Austro-Hungarian empire in the days , so you See one 's always in trouble of some kind ? and she held views , which soy mother considered unsuitable in a young girl . Maria was only a fete years older than myself , tall and sallow , with beautiful yellow-flecked dark eyes , rather like yours . And there was something about her that suggested a captive ? a fierce captive for whose imprisonment one was in some mysterious way responsible . She was a member of the intelligentsia , and made a point of speaking Russian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually spoke French . But Maria thought that wrong , like the way society teas organized . " " Did your father ? my grandfather ? feel that too ? " " Until my mother 's death , father sincerely believed everything a person of his class was expected to believe . Then loneliness made what amounted to a chemical change in him . He became reading addict , discovering ideas as boys discover stamps ; and Maria 's fierce young believingness was one of these stamps . Before he knew where he was , clandestine leaflets were as thick inside the house as autumn leaves outside and , shuffling eagerly among them , he became re acclimatized to love . " " What was my father like as a child ? " " I did n't me him after we 'd left Russia . At the beginning of the 1914 War my husband had an honorary post at our embassy in Paris , and we stayed on . He died there just as the revolution was starting . Maria did n't get in touch with me for several years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father when it all began , he was about five and they were living in the country then , near Moscow . One day a band of revolutionary soldiers arrived to requisition horses . Being pro-revolutionary , my father had no objection to handing over Ins horses . But the soldiers either thought his acquiescence suspect or were drunk ? whatever the re n , they slim him , began to loot , then suddenlyaso vanished without either explanations or horses . " All Maria 's energy went In getting Vadimyour father ? and herself out of Russia . San Remo was hoe goal . There was still a large Russian colony there , mostly people who had removed their money from Russia before the tear , let alone before the revolution . Maria became gouvernante in a hotel sheer , and Vadim was sent to a good Italian school and became for all practical purposes Italian . " " Did you sec them often ? " " Not very . The world is a small place only for people with big incomes . Next time I Went to Italy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was my mother like ? " " You 're very like her . " " Was she Russian too ? " " No , Italian . Well , French really . Her grandparents had been exiled from France after the Commune , and they had settled in Pisa . Your parents thought of themselves as Italians . " " And that 's where I came in . But then , I was born a refugee . " I remembered Anna of the delicatessen store crying out , " I always thought refugees were other people . " " It does n't say on my papers that I was born in Italy . Did they have to move on again ? " Aunt Natasha shook her head . " It was you that moved on , my darling , after they sneer dead ? " " Did they have natural deaths ? " Stretching out her hand , Aunt Natasha touched my face , running her forefinger over the bones ' outlines . A wave of useless longing swept over me . My parents were gone , and no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a companion the young girl she had been ; I had come too late . " I do love you , " I said , squeezing her hand and trying to thank her in kisses . " Natural is such an ambiguous word , my pet , " she said softly . " Your mother 's death was natural ? childbirth . " " Of me ? " Aunt Natasha nodded . " What happened to my father ? " " His misery took the forms of guilt , mysticism , of feelings that made him ill because his mind repudiated them . He became less and less capable of thinking what he was doing , or where he was going . In the end he was knocked down by , of all things , a tram . Here . . " Aunt Natasha dipped into a pocket and handed me a piece of bread , crumbs of wool clinging fluffily to it . I could taste tears and wool as well as bread , but the act of swallowing quieted me . " Horn did I get to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spiro , arranged things . I had told him to get in touch with me in case of trouble . I was n't going to have you in an institution . We could still travel then , you sec . " " Was n't it wartime ? " " The brink only . I got you home just before the Germans took us over . When that happened , Boris and I thought you had batter have false papers . " " Then I 'm really Italian ? " " Really ? Well , no . Technically you were , but really you 're a quarter Russian , a quarter Czech , a quarter French , and a quarter Italian . " " No wonder you thought false papers were indicated . " " It was n't so much that as the fact that your parents came under the heading intellectuals ? and Vittoria , your mother , was half Jewish . " Anti-Semitism was often discussed at school . Most people were against it , at least in theory . Reading about the war I had pitied , jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star of David stamped into their flesh . Now they were no longer they . They had become we . For the first time I wondered why self-pity seas generally dc- plored . It had been permissible for me to pity them as them . Why was it wrong for me to pity us ? The situation was not radically changed by my participation in it . I understood now why Aunt Natasha had not spoken of this before . At home everyone has a police record , half of 4 , er-et , composed of other people 's denunciations , the other half a four-page questionnaire one fills in oneself or has filled in by one 's owner in the case of a child ; and the most important part of this questionnaire concerns one 's origins : for example , artists arc permissible , but teachers suspect , as are peasants if they ever owned more than twelve acres . " Could we ever prove I 'm me if we wanted to ? " I asked . " Your birth must have been registered at Pisa , though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Spires alive . . . " " But , Aunt Natasha ? " " What , duck ? " " You were still in Paris . What had happened to get you here ? at home , I mean ? by the time you took um over ? " " An accident . One day I came out of that theater in the Champs El poles where the Pitoeffs had just started , acting , and jumped into a taxi . The driver kept craning round to look at me , but I took this as a tribute to my new hat , a cloche it was , all little blue-green feathers , how loved ' it ? never let anyone tell you , my pet , that there are better clothes than in Paris . " Then suddenly , halfway down the Avenue du Bois ? such a handsome avenue , smells of forests , and has a pink palace in it ? suddenly the driver turned round and said in Russian , So you arc going to the Yusupovs , princess ? ' and he stopped the taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my brother Yakov , so long ago it seemed , and we embraced and both sobbed a little . " I discovered the driver knew Boris , too . He had got across the frontier to the nearest republic , where he found a job with a circus . Once I knew where he was , of course I had to join him . " " How could you afford such a long journey ? " " I still had two pictures by Renoir . Anton had paid about for thousand francs for them , but by this time they were worth eighty thousand . " She sighed . " Though I was sorry to part with them . The people in Renoir 's pictures always seem to be having such a delicious time . " ? Would n't it have been better for Boris to come to Paris ? " " He wanted to be near home , so as to cross the frontier if things changed . He always meant to go back . For years we lived as if in a station waiting re re In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that particular train 's never going to come . " Timm Ileacky came the rattle of plates . All tand the room talk subsided , like gas fires popping out . Sitting there , I thought of my parents in the land where the orange tree grows , of Aunt Natasha in a cloche hat of blue-green feathers , of a taxi driver carrying news of Boris across Europe to a pink palace . I suddenly saw a picture of something that had happened to me at school . I was in the cloakroom , looking for my skating boots , when all at once Ladislaus , who was n't in my grade and had at that time not spoken to me mare than twice , came up behind me , put his hands on my shoulders , geting me round , and kissed me . At first I was angry , partly because I hate being taken by surprise , partly because Ladislaus obviously expected me to be flattered . Then he kissed me again , and although still annoyed , I was less so , and thought more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my annoyance melted into a new , an exquisite smtsation that made me tremble and joy trembling . For several days afterward I longed to 1. c-experience this sensation and , at first , was able . to do so merely by remembering this kiss . But , perhaps because I employed it too often , this method soon lost its efficacy , and I began wanting other kisses , not from Ladislaus , yet I did n't know from whom . But this phase did n't last long , I won a chess championship ? this and geometry were the only school subjects at which I always did well ? and soon forgot those few days of feverish longings . I had n't thought about them since , until now , when in a way I could not account for , they helped me understand Aunt Natasha 's story . After we had drunk our soup , and I had told Aunt Natasha to finish the schnapps because she felt cold and the floor was drafty , we made ourselves comfortable and slept . Tng snore-filled room was still dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black to gray . As I grew accustomed to the heaving sea of sleep around me , I realized that Aunt Natasha was breathing with a peculiar , light creakiness . I sat up and leaned over her . Her forehead was hot and dry , and she moved restlessly , as if trying to shake off a weight . For a second I sat still , my /mart thumping . Then I got up and crept out of the room to look for help : to look for people who were n't strangers here themselves . In the entrance hall , between two large baize-covered notice boards , I spied a door marked " Porter . " I knocked , got no reply , turned the handle , and kept On rattling , muttering angrily to myself , " What are they paid for ? Just like an official . Oh . hurry , blast you , hurry , hurry , hurry . " Light appeared behind the curtained glass upper half of the door , and presently the curtain seas pulled back by an elderly man in pajamas his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ately began to grumble . At home I should hays thought Ill ice before doing this . The porter patted my shoulders , first one , then the other , as if anxious to be fair to both . Then he tugged a uniform jacket over his pajamas , put a peaked cap over his few but tousled hairs , sat down at a rep-covered table , motioned me to do the same , and drew the two-piece telephone to-ward him , When he laid down the receiver , he wiped his forehead and said , " Thank God , the ambulance will come . Perhaps it would lie best to have the poor lady waiting here . " Shuffling in carpet dippers he opened a cupboard at the back of the room , tossed aside se flowerpots and half a dozen mousetraps , andom produced a deck chair and an army blanket , with which we improvised a stretcher . Daylight seas seeping into the gymnasium by the time see crept back . But no one stirred . When we lifted Aunt Natasha onto the chair she only muttered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' talk . She was very flushed over the cheekbones , but I thought the empty schnapps bottle might account for that . While we waited for the ambulance , the porter told me his name was Horst , that we were all in the Lord 's hands , but that this was no reason for not helping each other . Which did n't prevent , my worrying as to whether or not he would tell his syndicate what had happened . To my surprise he said he did n't belong to a syndicate . He had this job because he was a veteran . I wondered if Boris would count as a veteran . This was when I began wondering if we three could n't find ourselves a porter 's lodge here , for a start . Ten minutes later Aunt Natasha was in the ambulance , and Horst helped me climb after hem I begged him to look out for Boris and tell him where we were , and he reminded me to remember , should I forget his name , that he was Herr Chief Night Porter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken through a door marked " Emergencies , " and a young man in a white overall led me round the building into a hall with a checkerboard floor of black-andwhite marble . Across it , at a large desk , sat an older man in a white overall . My escort went and spoke to him in a low voice . The older man shrugged his shoulders , took off his horn-rimmed spectacles , wiped them with a piece of yellow leather , and beckoned to me . " Good morning . " He cleared his throat as if I were an audience . " I take it you have your mother 's identity papers ? " For a second I stared at ! aim . Of course I had n't my mother 's papers ; but equally impossible demands have to be met every day . Then the young man said , " Probably her mother has them on her , " and I realized they meant Aunt Natasha . I also realized that , as we kept important papers locked in the tea caddy that once belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost certainly been burned along with the rest of our belongings , we could therefore say anything We liked about our identity without anyone 's being able to prove here and nw that we were lying . For a second I had an exohilarating sensation of freedom , including freedom to fool these two men . Shaking my head regretfully , I said , " I 'm afraid our papers weer left behind . " They asked our names and home address . I gave Aunt Natasha 's maiden name , thinking that if we had the same no one could doubt our being blood relations or r deny me the right to visit her in the hospital . They also wanted to know when we had arrived , by which route , and if there had been any incidents at the frontier . When the man behind the desk had written all this down in triplicate , I asked in a propitiatory tone if I might join my mother . Taking me by the elbow , one of them led me to an elevator and down a clean white-walled passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other windows overlooking a park . At the corner we met a pretty young nurse in a starched cap and apron . When my companion asked about Aunt Natasha , this nurse gave me a glance , dubious but amiable , and said that , as there had been no roorn in the appropriate ward , the patient had been put in a private room just vacated by an appendix ease . She called my champion " doctor- and obviously liked him . Looking relieved , he told her I was the patient 's daughter , that the circumstances were unusual ? here he paused , then said " refugees " in a hasty ashamed tone ? so although he was n't , of course , asking her to break regulations , he did wish she would look after me . The nurse said of course , I could wait in her room until my mother was ready for me . Her room was extremely elegant : white walls , untracked ceiling , basin with running hot and cold water , shiny linoleum , bed with clean sheets and blankets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desk . The nurse said me to try and relax , to wash if I felt like it , by all means to use her brush and comb , and she would be back presently . On the desk was a framed snapshot of a young man , whom I recognized as the doctor , in white shirt and shorts , carrying a tennis racket . This cheered me . The toughest people can be induced to break regulations when in love . On the wall by the bed hung an ebony cross with a sprig of box tucked behind it . Going to the basin , I saw myself in the glass . My face was pale and grubby , and my hair , which I 'd grown in preparation for the permanent Wave , looked untidy and worn out . Having found a pair of scissors , I very carefully gave myself a pudding basin cut , after which I looked as if I could get past most people without attracting notice ? as was presently confirmed by the tone in which the nurse said , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But instead of leading the way to Aunt Natasha , she sat down and asked my name , which she had already been told . " I 'm afraid your mother wo n't be up and about for a while . She 's tired , of course , after all you 've been through . By the way , as you have n't any paper you tell me her age ? It would be a help medically . " Fear pinched at Inc . Could they prove Aunt Natasha was too old to be my mother ? Surely not . I had heard of women having children in their late forties . " Is there no one else with you ? " Unprepared for this question , I hesitated . I did n't want to deny Boris or make it difficult for him to gain admission to Aunt Natasha when he turned up , as I did n't doubt he would ; on the other hand , I could see the nurse was already sorry for me , and I knew I must make her even sorrier and therefore likelier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes to show I was speaking the truth , I said , " My father 's dead , and there 's no one else except ray uncle Boris . We could n't find hint ? leaving so hurriedly ? but he 's sure to turn up . " " I see . You do n't think , " she sounded apologetic , " you 'd better stay with the other refugees ? We 'll let you know ? " " Suppose she needs me ? " Suddenly I hated the nurse , the doctor , and the man behind the desk , hated the whole harassing world . " Well , we 'll see . " She led me down several whitewashed passages hung with crosses and pie-tures of historical characters in halm , then put her finger to her lips and softly turned a doorknob . There was Aunt Natasha , sleeping in a high whim bed . She was still flushed over the cheekbones , and her breathing was very light and quick . A blank temperature chart was fastened to the bottom of the bed . Cot/moiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusted here , I asked , ' ' What is the matter with her ? " The nurse looked at me thoughtfully , then said , " Pleurisy . " A wave of relief swept over me . Aunt Natasha had had pleurisy before , and Boris and I managed to nurse her through it , despite a cold winter and inadequate heating . So she was bound to recover quickly in a place like tiffs . " May I sit here awhile ? " I asked , wishing the nurse would go away . Site frowned , looked at her watch , risen said , " Just for a little while . I 'll come and fetch you before the doctor starts his rounds . " She looked so uneasy that I pulled myself together and said , " If anyone should come in I 'd say I dipped in without asking permission . " Putting her hffirl on my shoulder , she said , " Do try and relax . " This seemed to me a futile suggestion , so I said nothing . After the nurse had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head against Aunt Natasha . Her breathing teas lighter than dried leaves skittering in the wind , and now and then she gave a harsh little cough . I was so frightened I could n't hold my tears ; but I managed to keep quiet except for my breathing , which sounded gross in comparison with hers . Then I closed my eyes and clenched my teeth and bands and tried , until my cars tingled from the effort , to will all the love in my body out and into hers . WIN the nurffi told Ice to leave , I knew it would be useless to resist . Also I could n't have spoken just then , and needed privacy in which to finish crying . Crying in the street might attract notice . Luckily there was a dark corner two passages away . I was still crouched there , vaguely aware of distant footsteps , of doors being opened and shut , of a gust of music from a radio , and of a newly diffused smell of roast meat , when someone tapped past on high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dear voice said , speaking German with a foreign accent , ids something the matter ? " As she stepped nearer , I sate that the voice 's owne was tall and slender , about Aunt Natasha 's build , r and had the prettiest , cleanest curling White hair I had ever seen . As her skin was soft and smooth , this white hair did n't make her look old , but did make it difficult for site to guess her age . She wore a gray frock and coat , black hat , gloves , and bag , had three rows of pearls round her neck , and was accompanied by a faint sweet smell of scent . " Can I help you ? " Wondering how to turn this incident to account , I heard myself say , " Would you let me wafk with you to the exit , and if anyone speaks to you say I 'm a relative ? Because I ought not to be here " Very well . " She spoke briskly , as if she sate nothing unusual in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that I had a protector . we met no one except a dwarfed maidpushing a trolley of shining soup tureens . Their domed lids offered us contorted reflections of ourselves , like ones in fun-fair mirrors . Once we were outside I thanked her , holding out my hand . But instead of shaking it , she held it between her hands and asked ; " Where do you live , my dear ? " I pulled my hand away . For all I knew she might he an official in disguise . I had never before /net an official who smelled delicious , but that might be part of the disguise . Resenting her , I named our billet . " I see . " Site looked at me speculatively . " There must he something I can do . . . whom are you with ? " " My mother 's in this hospital . " " I see . Let 's get in the car . The street 's not the best place for talking . " Site led me to a small gray car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just then , to my hor-w r , a policeman came up , tapping his notebook ith a pencil in a suggestive way and eying as with the mixture-of distaste and satisfaction that suggests one has been caught in the act . But the woman beside me seemed unmoved , barely al-Rwed him to mouth a phrase about parking , and produced papers at the sight of which the policeman touched his hat , bossed , smiled , and removed himself . ' " How did you do that ? " I asked distrustfully . " UNESCO still has its uses . " After watching mc for a second , she sighed , then said , " Listen , my child , is German your only foreign language ? " I admitted I could manage in French or English . " Oh , well , that simplifies matters , " site said in English . " Now , my dear , you look brimming with alarm and despondency , and no Wonder . Should n't trust anyone an inch if I were in your place . So I 'll give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel like trusting me . " Her some was higher in English than in German , and she spoke faster , in a kind of hilarious rush , so that although I understood the gist Or what she said , I found keeping pace with her a strain . " Well , I was in Venice when all this started , attending some film festival with my son , Joe . But the moment trouble started up here , Joe insisted he had to come and see for himself . By the way , what 's your name , my dear ? " I told her , adding , " I do n't know yours . " " Ruiz . Kitty Ruiz . Wo n't you tell me a little about yourself ? " Remembering Aunt Natasha 's advice never to tell a lie , but not to loll everyone the truth , I gave a censored account of myself . Ever since Mrs. Ruiz routed that policeman , the idea had been growing in me that she might be able to provide penicillin or other black market products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms in detail , ending with , " but the trouble is , she has no business in that hospital . " " Why ever not ? " ' Because they 're afraid we may bring infectious diseases . They 're going to set up a special quarantine camp for us . " " How do you know that ? " " Horst , the porter , told me . " " Well , but ? how did your mother get into the hospital ? " " Because the girl who answers the emergency calls at the hospital is married to Horst 's son . They combined it between them . And there was a nice doctor . And once she was there , ill , " I stopped , misery rushing back over me . " Will it take her long to get over pleurisy there ? " " Possibly not . NOW listen to me , my dear , there does n't seem much point , all things considered , in your going back to that school . Yes , " as I opened my mouth to interrupt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no hue and cry is raised . Then I suggest you come back to the hotel and stay with us for the time being . They can easily put a camp bed in our sitting room , and why sleep on the Moor when a bed 's availabk ? " I was so astonished by this offer that for a few seconds I said nothing . At home we are not allowed to accompany foreign visitors up to their hotel rooms , We may visit them in the lobby , under the porter 's eyes , but not go upstairs . Misunderstanding my expression , ! visa Ruiz said , " I assure you it will be all right . My papers are in order ; no one will think I 'm kidnaping you . " It had n't occurred to me that anyone might kidnap me , since neither financial nor political benefit could be obtained by doing so ; but it immediately struck me that kidnapers , like most people engaged in illegality , would be sure to have their papers in order . " I must let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hesitated , not wanting to lessen the alone-inthe-world-ness of my situation in Mrs. Ruiz 's eyes before making sure of the penicillin . " An old friend and neighbor who helped us get away . He 's bound to turn up . " " Then he 's bound to go to that school , and the porter will tell him where you arc . " Mrs. Ruiz stopped the car in front of a big hotel as full of lighted wind.ws as a government building on a reception night . Although there were only a fete drops of rain in the air , a large man in a frogged , plum-colored uniform held a large plum-colored umbrella over us as we walked to the revolving door , which was set M motion for as by a small plum-colored pageboy . Inside were a great stretch of thick , soft , plum-colored carpet and waterdrop chandeliers like the ones used in the Sleeping Beauty ballet . Upstairs , too , the carpet was so Mick that our walk clown the passage 11,311111 have been made in silence if the radiators had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into which we were shown was full of luxury : a large pneumatic-looking sofa , a low table of shining wood half covered by nee. , papers and magazines with glossy covers , a shallow black china bowl of anemones . " We 'll have dinner up here , Resi , do n't you think ? " said Mrs. Ruiz , " And you 'd better have Joe 's room . " " Wo n't he mind ? " " Mind ? My dear , he 'll be delighted . " Again , I was awar of something unusually persuasive about Mrs.e Ruiz . Unlikely as it sounded , I could not help believing , for that moment , that a foreigner still unaware of my existence would be delighted to find himself obliged to sleep on a camp bed because I had his room . I also ? and this impressed me more  --  had the use of his bathroom , the like of which I had never seen outside Elsa 's magazines . I was still examining it , turning taps on and all and fingering the thick soft-ribbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Mrs. Ruiz azors came in with a toothbrush , washrag , and cake of honeyed-smelling soap . She also brought a long white nightdress . After I had bathed and dried myself on a thick towel , warm from having been spread over hot pipes , I got into Joe's- bed , the most comfortable I had ever been in , and was brought a tray laid with rolls and butter , a wing of chicken , lettuce , oranges , and a decanter of red wine . While Mrs. Ruiz was out of the room I wrapped a buttered roll and part of the chicken in a lettuce leaf , and the lettuce in a piece of the razor paper , and put that under my pillow . They might give Aunt Natasha enough to eat in the hospital , but I had no guarantee they would . Then I ate and drank with concentration . The rolls were wonderful , soft white ones , quite fresh , with caraway seeds scattered over their golden brown outsides ; and there was plenty of butter arranged in smooth curls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of splintered ice . I began to feel as if there were a glass wall between me and the events of the last twenty-four hours . I half expected to wake up at home and find I had been dreaming of Mrs. Ruiz , smiling beside me.
