The Makropoulos Secret ( by Karel Capek ) is a kind of philosophic mystery story-by the author of R.U.R.-first produced in the ' 20s . It is the kind of phililosophic mystery story that Director Tyrone Guthrie , with his instinct for theater and his itch for new slants , would clearly have enjoyed remodeling . The Guthrie treatment did not mean giving the play a more modern look or a different philosophic spin . It meant reverting to a 19th century mode of acting and a Continental air of high twaddle-one moment for their value as drama , another for what is the outlines of a joke . Since the chief character in Capek 's tale of a strange , century-old lawsuit is a grandiloquent opa singer , tasseled flimflam is never very difficult . Since the opera singer is curiously omniscient about the past and is forever flinging forth , with a veiled countenance , a Who-am-I ? , there is a nice audience guessing game in the making . <P> And since the opera singer is acted to the richly encrusted hilt by Eileen Herlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that perplexes less and less as it proceeds , just manages to squeak through . With a stylish , long-discontinued look , Actress Herlie can rivet attention ; with a bass-fiddle-deep laugh , she suddenly arouses laughter . The Guthrie treatment fares best when there is nothing much to treat : the air of secrecy proves more rewarding than the secret , the theatrical Herlie-burly than the philosophical coda . When the play finally turns serious , it seems , more than anything else , like a last-minute spoilsport . Were the play better or the philosophy more challenging , Guthrie 's approach might smack of outrage ; as things stand , it is perhaps the only armor against boredom .
