BATTLE FOR MANHATTAN ( 128 pp. ) - Bruce Bliven Jr. - Holt ( $3.50 ) . <P> Bruce Bliven Jr . is a veteran of the Normandy invasion who fell to wondering after his return to Manhattan if it had happened that way at home . He ended up writing the almost-forgotten story of how indeed it had . The two-day " battle for Manhattan " is not the most glorious chapter in U.S. history . But as Author ( The Wonderful Writing Machine ) Bliven has pieced it together , with the help of period prints and maps showing the fighting in terms of today 's streets and landmarks , his compact and lively book may be just the handy companion for cliff-dwelling strollers ready to look for history under the sidewalks of New York . <P> Defend America ? One hot morning just 180 years ago , Britain 's General Sir William Howe , having taken Brooklyn with " the largest expeditionary force Great Britain had ever assembled " ( 32,000 men , 200 ships ) , sent his redcoats across the East River to a landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the massed fire of 86 naval cannon , the Connecticut farm-boy defenders ran for their lives . General George Washington , taken by surprise , galloped down from his headquarters at the northern end of the island ( now Coogan 's Bluff , overlooking the Polo Grounds ) . " Take the wall , " he shouted . " Take the cornfield . " When the militiamen rushed unheeding past him , according to some accounts , he wept , hurled his hat to the ground and roared , " Are these the men with which I am to defend America ? " Then for a long time he sat on his horse in a daze , so that the British troopers advancing north from Murray Hill would have been on him had not an aide taken his horse 's bridle and led the general away . <P> So disgraceful was the rout that General Howe could easily have pushed west to the Hudson , cut off the half of Washington 's forces still posted at the lower end of the island , and , says Bliven , " the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " But pleasure-loving General Howe stopped for " cakes and Madeira " at Mrs. Murray 's on Murray Hill . Washington 's men got safely away to Harlem Heights with the loss of only about 50 casualties and 300 prisoners , and the next morning fresh Ranger scouts , led by Lieut . Colonel Thomas Knowlton of Bunker Hill fame , started up the action again around the Jones farmhouse ( near Riverside Drive and 106th Street ) . <P> Not Worth Defending ? Feeling a desperate need for some sort of morale-saving fight , Washington quickly sent two small forces of Rhode Islanders , Virginians and Connecticut Rangers south across the Hollow Way ( approximately 125th Street ) , and soon a brisk tussle started for possession of a buckwheat field atop the heights on which Columbia University and Riverside Church now stand . Though Knowlton ( after saying , " I do not value my life if we do but get the day " ) fell mortally wounded , the Continentals fought their way out of the rocks and for the first time " had the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurrah , " shouted the Yanks as the British broke off action and left the field .
