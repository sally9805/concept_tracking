A presidential campaign is more than a debate , more than a chance for the electorate to compare the " views " of candidates . It is also an ordeal , a trial of character . As debate , the Nixon case did not amount to much on either side ; the Democrats started an argument , lost it and wound up defending Stevenson 's fund which had been brought to light by the Nixon case . As ordeal , however , the Nixon case was by far the most important event so far , in the campaign . <P> Few verdicts of that obscure judge , public opinion , have ever been plainer than the reaction to Nixon himself . That part of the public that could be convinced ( and had to be convinced ) made up its mind that he was an honest and thoroughly sincere man . His fund was probably a mistake in political judgment ( as was Stevenson 's ) but by the time Nixon had finished speaking , the snowballing charges against him had melted down to a tactical error-and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's acquittal was Eisenhower 's ordeal in the Nixon crisis . From the start , the central ( and unsolved ) problem of the Eisenhower campaign was how to get over in public speeches the relationship between Ike 's essential character and the problems facing the nation . What the speeches had failed to do , the Nixon crisis did . <P> Ike had two courses easier to follow than the one he took : 1 ) he could have fired Nixon instanter ; 2 ) he could have promptly announced that Nixon would stay on the ticket . Most of the advice that Ike got was for one of these courses or the other . <P> Political amateurs , in general , were for the first course , some of them insisting that the Nixon case offered a heaven-sent opportunity to demonstrate Ike 's political purity and independence . Reporters assigned to Ike 's train were almost unanimous in this view , and many of their stories reflected the fact . The argument was that whether Nixon was right or wrong he had become a liability to the ticket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view and put seeming expediency above justice to Nixon he would have belied what his friends have said of him : that his character and experience fit him for the decision-making job at a time of moral crisis and leadership crisis in the history of his country . <P> <P> Professional politicians , in general , urged Ike to take the second course . If he had followed their advice and backed Nixon completely from the start , there is no doubt that Ike would have choked off much of the anti-Nixon clamor simply by removing the element of dramatic suspense from the case . But if Ike had done that , it would have sounded like an echo of the Truman " loyalty , " the complacent quality in the Administration that has caused what men of both parties recognize as " the mess in Washington . " Ike was neither impetuous nor smug about the Nixon crisis . He admitted a real possibility that Nixon might be wrong , but he waited for Nixon 's public defense and he was not afraid of the people .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
