IF YOU want to know what the civilization of the United States will be like tomorrow , take a look at California today . Some of the best and worst features of our national life originated in the Golden State , and others occur there in more than life size . Californians are restless and adventurous ; their incomes are a fifth higher than the national average ; two-thirds of them have lived in their present communities only thirty years or less , and feel little compulsion to be bound by tradition . Unless you have checked on California conditions quite recently , your concept of life in that state is probably rather out of date . You may be thinking of it as the place where the movie stars practice what might be called consecutive monogamy ; where hundreds of thousands of retired Iowans come to warm c their aging bones in the hot sunshine and to vote for golden chimeras like the Townsend Plan . The California of your memory is very likely the one where every roadside stand is built in the shape of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product is frankfurters , a huge freezer if it is ice cream . In that nostalgic California , Carmel was the Greenwich Village of the West , home of writers and painters ; queer religious sects blossomed along the ocean and on the fringes of the desert ; billboards were decorated eight hours a day with living models ; Aimee Semple McPherson made evangelism into big business ; and ostrich farms and orange groves were conveniently near one another , presumably so that you could feed whole oranges to an ostrich in quick succession , and see them follow one another down his elongated gullet like pearls on a string . To be sure , some of these aspects of the old California still remain . Nowhere in the United States are home barbecue pits more like the Taj Mahal , or the sayings on barbecue aprons more like Joe Miller 's Joke Book . The opening of a new supermarket is still an occasion for mass ecstasy , with searchlights and symphony orchestras . Small towns continue to put signs along the highway expressing the jubilation of their inhabitants at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jubilation only slightly tainted by the fact that almost every last ranch house and every square inch of vacant land is for sale . You can still find the sort of booster represented by the man who said to a group of Eastern visitors admiring a spectacular sky : " Yes , it is a pretty sunset if I do say so myself . " Paradise , Slightly Shopworn YET the changes are probably more important than the things that remain unchanged . The Californians have been doing their best to ruin the state as a place in which to live , and over substantial areas have come surprisingly near to succeeding . While the population has been increasing 300 per cent in thirty years , industry has gone up 800 per cent . California is crowded today with steel mills , automobile assembly plants , shipyards , big chemical and oil installations . In the cities , finance has become high  | finance ; the charcoal flannel suit and the sincere tie , not to speak of the black Homburg and the tightly rolled umbrella , are beating back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan advertising the nearest mortuary establishment . As one town after another has been overrun by industry and therefore largely destroyed as a place for pleasant living , Californians , not unnaturally , display an ambivalence toward the development . A small minority , most of them already well-to-do , profit directly from the sale of land for factories and from accompanying activities , and are delighted . Another and larger minority find work in the factories ; if you assume they would be in California anyhow , and that people can not prosper indefinitely by taking in one another 's washing , it is probably a good thing that they should be kept off the relief rolls . The standard argument is that with a population growing so rapidly , the cost of public services tends to expand in a geometrical ratio ( the state government 's operating deficit is increasing about $1,250,000 a week ) . Householders ' taxes , it is argued , can not possibly carry the burden , and bringing industry in is therefore essential , no matter how this may devastate the community landscape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do no more than cover the added burden it creates , while a well planned residential section also pays its own way ; but the notion is now almost universally believed . An odd mutation of the American Dream is to be seen in the case of the elderly retired person who has bought a small house intending to live out his days in it . The constant pressure of population pushes up real-estate prices almost everywhere , and his house has a steadily increasing book value . He usually does n't intend to sell it ; his taxes keep increasing , which he does n't like ; he is plagued by crowds everywhere ? including , as a rule , crowds of automobiles rushing past his home in what was probably , not long ago , a quiet residential street . Yet all this means to him a success story of some sort , and he gives every evidence of being pleased by his misery , even though he wo n't admit it . ( It is standard practice for an old farmer from Iowa to arrive on a Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newcomers from Iowa who are spoiling everything . " ) The Booster and the Smog ONE result of the attempt to make California one vast Pittsburgh with palms has lately made headlines across the country . I had read in the New York papers about smog , but I had no idea what it was like until I arrived in Los Angeles on a breathless August day , to find visibility down almost to zero , and was forced to sit weeping copiously , unable to read or to do anything else involving close use of the eyes , until the visitation lifted . On this day , schools and offices closed shortly after noon ; doctors postponed operations ; and many people visited oculists for emergency treatment . Whether California will ever really grapple with the problem remained an open question when these words were written . Unfortunately , there are a number of simultaneous causes for smog and each of them involves a vested interest with political influence . The big refineries and industrial plants , many of them only lately come to California , are naturally reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on smog research without thus far achieving very substantial results . Automobiles , of which Los Angeles has the world 's thickest jam , are the basis for the whole economy of the region ; thus far , no one has devised an inexpensive trap for  | pollutants in the exhaust , or if he has , it is still a secret . Every California backyard contains an incinerator in which the householder burns his trash and sometimes his garbage ; collection of these items for disposal elsewhere costs money , and neither the householder nor the municipality wants to pay for it . And even when household refuse is collected , it is standard practice in California to take it a mile or two outside of town and burn it , on the naive assumption that a cloud of smoke a couple of miles away does n't matter . Old-time California boosterism is exhibited in relation to smog . I talked to dozens of people about it , people living in widely separated districts . Each man admitted that it is a terrible problem but in each case , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a smog-free enclave of its own . The nasty stuff engulfed his neighbors on all sides ; three blocks away it was asphyxiating ; but he himself enjoyed ambient air of unparalleled purity . Los Angeles , which has had smog for years in steadily increasing volme , did n't even consider doing anything effective about it until it was threatened last fall by a Donoratype disaster . The San Francisco Bay region is following precisely the same course , with a lag of a few years . In that part of the state , co-operative action by several counties is required ; whenever an attempt is made to bring them together , a cold war starts . People on the Jump EVERYBODY knows nowadays about the rapid growth of California 's population . The state is increasing at three times the national average , and the rate is accelerating ; in the past twelve years alone the number of new Californians has been greater than the total population of 40 of the 48 states , or of Finland , Norway , Denmark , or Switzerland . The Californians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to conceal their smiles as they tell you that at certain times population has gone up three times as fast as Texas and four times as fast as Florida . The growth , slightly more than half of which is by migration and the rest by excess of births over deaths , amounts to about 1,400 a clay . This means , among many other things , that the state needs every day a new schoolhouse of thirteen or fourteen rooms . It spends nearly $1 million daily on roads , and is terribly behind . It is also terribly behind on hospitals , jails , drainage and sewer systems , and everything else you can think of . When I arrived in California for a stay of some months , I remarked casually at a dinner party that I should need to make contact with a doctor and a dentist . Promptly my friends began discussing , not the merits of local practitioners of these professions , but how some overworked man could be persuaded to accept me as a patient . This rapid growth makes California a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeps away many old landmarks , creating , it is said , insecurity , confusion , and some breakdown of standards of behavior . Every politician when he runs for re-election finds quantities of strangers in his district who know of him slightly if at all . Mailing lists more than a few months old are almost unusable . Not only do people move into the state in fantastic numbers ; they are equally restless within its borders . Some of them are yanked back and forth remorselessly by big corporations ; others move for any of a variety of reasons , or for none . At a recent party in Los Altos , given to introduce some of the newcomers to older inhabitants ? a few of whom had lived there four or five years and were therefore practically prehistoric ? a young matron was heard to remark a little wearily that she and her family had moved thirty-nine times in ten years . Her husband works for a big company . Naturally , moving service is carried to great heights in a state where there is so much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack all your possessions , move and unpack them , put everything away , cook your first dinner in the new house , and have it smoking hot on the table when you arrive . The Political Backwash MANY efforts have been made to explain the ultra-conservative character of certain California communities . Los Angeles shares with Houston , Texas , the dubious honor of being the country 's most backward community ? in refusing to permit  | the facts about the United Nations to be taught in the public schools , and in rejecting an offer of badly needed aid for teachers because it came from one of the great foundations . Fanatics from that city frightened Governor Goodwin Knight into refusing to join the rest of the country in commemorating United Nations Day . About one-quarter of California 's migrants are over sixty-five , almost all of the remainder under thirty-five . Contrary to the common notion , the elderly arrivals do not ? or anyway , should not ? come to California to participate in her generous old-age-pension plan . You can not benefit from this plan until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even then , you have to be poor enough to pass a rather drastic means test : you may own only a small amount of property , and if you have relatives who could support you , the state will try to force them to do so . THE typical elderly migrant is a person who has some money , and it is often said that this makes him unusually conservative politically , but there is actually little evidence of this . California has put through a lot of advanced social legislation , and elderly people seem to have voted for it in the same proportion as younger ones . They have also voted heavily in every election for the Townsend Plan or one of its many variants , which would in all cases put a heavy burden on the tax rates . A better explanation would seem to be that there is a natural westering tropism for crackpots , and that , while comparatively few in number , they are excessively vocal . They shout down the more sensible majority , especially since they always wrap themselves in the flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " to them , the results are often spectacularly good . For many years , California elections were simple ; until last year you just voted for Earl Warren for Governor on all tickets except the Communist and called it a day . Because of cross-filing a man could win the primary of several parties simultaneously , which is what Warren and a few other people habitually did . California got a reputation for having an enormous independent vote ; but then the Legislature modified the law to say that while you could run on as many tickets as you pleased , you had to specify some one party as being your own . With a jerk , the state went back to party regularity . It turned out that the voters had n't been independent at all ; they had just been unable to remember the party affiliations of the dozens of men on the ballot . As soon as they had a chance , they gleefully plumped for the straight ticket . The Contented Suburbs ALMOST all of California 's newcomers have moved into detached single houses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warrant apartment houses and ? perhaps with an eye on the possibility of earthquakes ? even these tend to spread out , low and rambling . The new houses are handsome , if you like modern design . The most vital and characteristic development , the ranch house , has now spread to parts of the country where it is far less appropriate than in the mild winter climate for which it was first intended . The old people who come to California to retire are unlikely to buy a house in a new tract , but the young family with small children leaps avidly at the chance . The result is that new suburban developments are opened , one after the other , like popcorn over a hot fire . It 's not hard to envisage the California of a few years hence as one vast suburb , spreading from the mountains to the sea , from Mexico to Oregon , with all its inhabitants riding around all day in baby-blue four-door sedans at 35 miles an hour , obediently halting for the stop sign at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bedevil the mass-produced suburbs elsewhere . All the adults are about the same age ? thirty-five or less ; the husbands are away all day ; the children never see any old people . If the breadwinner is out of a job for more than a few weeks , the house soon goes back to the bank and is put up for resale ; this happened in a lot of cases in the recession of 1953-54 . Unwary buyers find they must suddenly join together to arrange ? and pay for ? schools , parks , sewers , storm drains , even hospitals and fire protection . While the sociologists wring their hands over these things , I must record that so far as I can discover , the tract-dwellers love their houses and the modern gadgets with which  | they are equipped , they do n't worry about the future , and they form satisfactory social patterns with the greatest of ease and dexterity . THE young California matron works a sixteen-hour day and loves it . She is the family chauffeur and the household shopper ( nothing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with acres of parking space and a young man in a tower , with microphone and loud-speaker , to guide her to an empty berth for her car . She does all her own work , or nearly all , perhaps having a woman come in once a week . Between times , she is an enthusiastic , active member of the parent-teacher association , the American Association of University Women , the League of Women Voters , and quite possibly two or three local societies with fancy names , which meet to hear visiting lecturers or to have the latest books and plays reviewed by one of their own members . The young husband is as contented as his wife , even though he rarely sees his home by daylight except on weekends . He does most of the garden work , he tinkers with his car , he is dragged to some of the concerts and woman's-club lectures . In many cases , he came to California in the Armed Services during World War II or the Korean War , and brought his family out to settle there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the move , he is spiritually committed to the state ; he has to like it , and he does . In California ? who could have failed to hear ? ? flowers bloom all the year around and it seems as though even a broom handle thrust into the earth would promptly put forth foliage . I know a man who recently moved from Los Angeles to a suburb near San Francisco by means of six huge vans , five of them full of his camellia plants , an operation which to any California gardener would seem quite normal . Gardeners visiting one another perform a ritual dance like that of the whooping crane . " My , my , " says a visitor , " what a pretty garden ! " " Yours is pretty , too , " says the host , and proceeds to deprecate his own incredibly beautiful precincts . It is part of the California mores never to call on anyone without bringing a small gift of home-raised fruit or vegetables . I know a man who complains sadly that in the past three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce ( which he prefers ) because the neighbors bring so much , and he has to give away such quantities in return . Natural Habitat of the Auto CALIF0RNIA did n't invent the automobile , but nowhere else , so far as I know , has its use come to such complete flowering . This was the first state to have enough cars so that every inhabitant could roll simultaneously , and today it has gone far beyond that , in most regions to one car for every adult . For instance : The town of Burlingame casually passed an ordinance the other day that every threebedroom house to be erected in the future must be equipped with a two-car garage , and nobody but me thought this at all remarkable , or seemed to be reminded of Herbert Hoover . Not far from where I am living , there is a family with six adults and six automobiles ; they have simply turned part of their front lawn into a parking lot . A few months ago , an unemployed carpenter in the town of Hayward was refused state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own an automobile . The state official ruled that without a car , this man was not immediately available for work if it were offered to him . Even with California 's crowded and mostly  | inadequate highways , people hop into their cars on the flimsiest excuse , and drive huge distances . A few months ago in the middle of the rainy season , I was invited to lunch in a house reached by several miles of perilous mountain road . There was a cloudburst just as I started , and I was proud of my hardihood in not turning back . A dozen other guests had each come a minimum of fifty miles , and after lunch departed casually ? in ten or eleven cars ? for the fifty-mile drive home . Vandals by the Thousands AMONG the migrants who are attracted to California are juvenile delinquents of both sexes , helping to make this problem 40 per cent worse than the national average . They pour into the state by the thousands from all over the country ; every six months , several trainloads of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of dollars . I started to keep a file of news about it ( omitting actual crime like rape and robbery ) in the immediate vicinity of the place where I happened to be living , but gave up in despair after a few weeks . In that length of time , I collected a grim dossier of which these are a few typical examples : A group of high-school boys , celebrating a football victory , broke into an unoccupied and valuable house , got drunk , and burned it to the ground . Another group pulled up all the roadside traffic signs along twenty miles of highway , and piled them in a heap on the lawn of a man whom , apparently , they did n't like . Several boys and girls , riding in an open car , threw pebbles into the windows of cars passing in the opposite direction , causing at least one bad crash . Young vandals invaded the old-fashioned estate of a wealthy citizen , whose gardens were decorated with valuable statues , and destroyed as many of these as they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakable parts . Throughout California , a special problem is Commencement night at the local high school ; it is a tradition that the member of the graduating class stay out all night , get drunk , and if possible get themselves killed on the highway . Elaborate plans are now made to circumvent this impulse toward mass suicide . The Commencement dance begins at midnight , lasts all night , and formal dress is obligatory ; the idea is to keep the children occupied until dawn , if possible , and to arrange that if they do escape , their dinner jackets and long dresses will notify the bartenders in roadhouses that these customers are under age . High , Middle , and Lowbrow SOPHISTICATED writers like Evelyn Waugh and Aldous Huxley who have satirized California civilization overlook the fact that here , as everywhere else in the world , culture exists simultaneously at many levels , which function happily side by side . Most people seek the recreations appropriate to their intellectual capacity . Thus , those who can never hope to break the IQ level of 100 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a hot-dog stand in the shape of a hot dog , or cheerfully waits for hours in the street at a movie " premeer " to get a glimpse of the stars on their way in . As Russell Lynes has pointed out , people at each intellectual level tend to show great moral indignation because of the way in which those at a lower level spend their spare time . In fact , the 64 per cent of us who are in the middle intelligence group tend to disapprove in both directions ? of the comic-book readers below us and of the Kafka-Kierkegaard Axis above ? unless the members of the latter are smart enough , as many of them are , to dissemble their brains . In California as elsewhere you can find art , literature , music , and drama to suit your own taste . Californians buy one and a half times as many books as their numbers would suggest , and the range of quality is presumably the same as in other parts of the country . They subscribe to highbrow magazines in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but both of them seem to be flourishing mightily . Every little town has its association of Sunday painters and gives an annual show , with many creditable works ? at the level , say , of Winston Churchill and President Eisenhower . The big cities have good symphony orchestras , and few indeed are the high schools  | ithout an orchestra and a band , each of a hundred pieces . When Carmel gives its annual Bach Festival , every motel for fifty miles around is booked solid . All winter long , touring musicians give concerts throughout the state . For a random example , in the Santa Clara Valley each of eleven small communities is presenting this winter a series of concerts . You buy a season ticket to those in your own community , and this lets you attend those in the other ten towns as well , at an average cost of ten cents per concert , to hear such performers as Rise Stevens , the Robert Shaw Chorale , Camilla Wicks , and the Budapest and Paganini String Quartets . THE theatrical situation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forever dying , has succumbed again , this time under the impact of television , and its place has been taken by a proliferation of little theaters on an amateur or semiprofessional basis . In a few cases , they present new plays by local dramatists , but for the most part they stick to the Broadway successes of yesterday , and to the classics . A few of these little theaters are very good indeed ; everyone knows about the Pasadena and La Jolla Playhouses , where Hollywood stars , chafing under the restraints of the movies , perform happily for little remuneration or none . In the typical little theater , however , the situation is more spotty . The direction , acting , scenery , and lighting range from pretty good to pretty awful ; on the other hand , the quality of the plays themselves is high . For instance , on a fairly characteristic weekend not long ago , playgoers in the San Francisco Bay region could choose among : " Oedipus , " by Sophocles ; " Lysistrata , " by Aristophanes ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hay Fever , " by Noel Coward ; " Lady Windermere 's Fan , " by Oscar Wilde ; " The Play 's the Thing , " by Molnar ; " The Climate of Eden , " by Moss Hart ; " The Country Girl , " by Odets ; " Season in the Sun , " by Gibbs ; " The Happy Time , " by Taylor ; " Night Must Fall , " by Williams ; and " The Man Who Came to Dinner , " by Kaufman and Hart . This is a far better group of choices than has been simultaneously on display on Broadway in forty years . Californians , perhaps making the best of their situation , have told me they would rather see a mediocre production of a great play than a polished performance of a lot of trash . It is an interesting point . Writers : Professional and Otherwise NoT only does California consume literature ; it produces writing of all types and every quality . Magazine editors know that the Golden State provides far more than its fair proportion of manuscripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The state swarms with amateur writers who go on cheerfully year after year , getting published at long intervals , or not at all . If you had an eight-line poem in the Ladies ' Home Journal in 1952 , that fact is worth mentioning every time you are introduced at a writers ' conference , up to and including 1955 . These conferences proliferate like measles spots ; sometimes the participants pay a fee , and there is a professional staff , but far more often the writers just gang together for an afternoon of commiseration and reading their own works aloud . Judgments uttered on these occasions are conspicuously gentle ; the critic always remembers that it may be his turn next . Beyond this , there are professional writers , who are at least twice as numerous as the law of averages would suggest . California has a century-old tradition as a spawning ground for authorship , native writers seeking to be called to New York , where they struggle for enough success to go home to California again . Every reader of murder mysteries has noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now live in the West ; so do a good proportion of creators of every other  | type of imaginative work , including the youthful writers of avant-garde novels . California journalism seems to me to be about up to the average level elsewhere in the United States outside New York . Most California papers have little authentic local flavor , but that is true everywhere . Radio and television are about as good and bad as they are in other places ; the producing community in Hollywood which now turns out so much of the national television fare is isolated from the rest of the state , and spins its material out of its own inward consciousness ; everything goes to New York and then comes hack for California listeners and viewers , usually several weeks late . The same thing is true of the movies ? they are in California but not of it . Generalizations about the proportion of support for highbrow and lowbrow activity in any community must of course be carefully checked . There is an important lesson in the experience of the British Broadcasting Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' delight and to make no compromise with the public taste . When the BBC conducted a survey , however , it found that three out of four of the highbrows were ignoring the program ; they never listen to anything on the radio , sharing the snobbish attitude of their opposite numbers in this country . On the other hand , among the lowbrows supposed to be hopelessly incapable of enjoying that sort of thing , 10 per cent were habitual devotees . There are so many lowbrows that 10 per cent of them outnumbered 25 per cent of the highbrows sixteen to one . The Invisible People DESPITE industrialization , California is still one of the top states in the nation in agricultural production ; there is an enormous need for farm labor , much of it migratory workers who move about with the seasons , bringing in crop after crop . The state is ambivalent about the workers , as it is about so many other things . There is hostility to those of Mexican birth or parentage ; in Los Angeles it was popular for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pachucos . Californians fulminated against the wetbacks until it began to seem really possible that the supply of them might be choked off by international agreement ; then the editorialists hastily reversed . The itinerant agricultural workers ? " fruit tramps , " they are called ? also continue to include a good many of the Okies and Arkies about whom John Steinbeck wrote in The Grapes of Wrath . Everyone tells me that conditions for these workers are much better now than they were when his book was published fifteen years ago , and I have no reason to doubt it . Many thousands of these fruit tramps move about the state , month after month , almost invisibly so far as the bulk of the solid , respectable , middle-class citizens are concerned . Their cars on the roads are indistinguishable for the most part from those of anyone else . The big ranches and orchards provide inconspicuous living quarters , used only a few weeks of the year , and in other cases the community helps out . Nobody ever talks about this great human tide ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning when any given crop is ready for the harvest , you will suddenly see hundreds of figures in working clothes ? men , women , and a plethora of children ? clustered over the fields adjacent to the highway ; a few days later these same fields are empty again ? except for a huge pile of filled boxes waiting for the trucks . H. G. Wells in his famous book , The Time Machine , wrote of a civilization in the distant future in which all work was done by rodentlike human mutants living underground , while the surface dwellers had also degenerated into childlike , happy creatures , totally incapable of taking care of themselves . The analogy is certainly imperfect so far as California 's cheerful and competent middle-class society is concerned ; but there is a thought here . I 'm glad I 'm not a fruit tramp .
