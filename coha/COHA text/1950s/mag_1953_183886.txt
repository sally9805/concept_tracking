( See cover ) <P> Among the hundreds of German and Austrian Communists who went to Spain in the ' 30s to fight in the civil war , the man to fear most was a taciturn , cold-eyed German named Walter Ulbricht . In Albacete , far behind the Republican lines , Special Agent Ulbricht set up a German section of the OGPU and , on Moscow 's orders , proceeded to rid the Communist ranks of Trotskyites . For those special cases which did not respond to the lash , the pliers , the hot wires and the other accepted tools of his craft , Ulbricht fashioned a tiny cell of granite blocks in which a prisoner could neither stand nor sit . Those who lived to tell called it Ulbricht 's " stone coffin . " <P> Walter Ulbricht moved on to bigger things . With mortar made in Moscow , he built a stone coffin for a land of 18 million people and called it the German Democratic Republic . <P> But killing individual Trotskyites and killing a nation are not the same . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crypt that Soviet might and Walter Ulbricht 's Communist regime built for them , unable to sit in comfort or stand in freedom . Then they rose up , and Walter Ulbricht 's masterpiece began to show cracks . <P> Symbol of Failure . One day last week , the coffinmaker stood before a crowd in Potsdam 's Platz der Nationen . At 60 , he is a sturdy , thick-bodied man , with thinning brown hair and dark eyes that dart busily above pouches of crow 's feet . A mustache shades his upper lip , and a goatee bobs from the point of his chin in disarming capriciousness . It is much like Lenin 's goatee-a comparison Walter Ulbricht has long encouraged , for most of his life he has dreamed of becoming Germany 's Lenin , the triumphant father and leader of a Communist Germany . <P> Instead , he is the most hated man in Germany . <P> The crowd before him was sullen and restless ; several thousand had been dragooned from their homes and jobs by Communist Vertrauensleute ( trusties ) and herded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the Communist Volkspolizei ; just out of sight , their guns ready for any signs of trouble , were soldiers of the Soviet army . The man who wanted to be Lenin spoke , not in triumph but in apology . <P> " Measures to improve the living conditions of our people . . . will ... be carried out , " said Ulbricht in harsh Saxony German . " ... We know we can improve the living standards of the people only by a permanent increase of working productivity , by better organization ... by making up production lost by the unrest .
