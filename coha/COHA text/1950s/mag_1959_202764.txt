One afternoon in 1918 , Yale 's swimming coach fell suddenly ill and someone yelled at Bob Kiphuth , a young physical education instructor : " Get up there in a hurry and direct the swimming squad . " Robert John Herman Kiphuth , 27 , had never coached swimming before , but he got up there and started directing . He has been doing it ever since . In 41 years as coach of the Yale team . Kiphuth has amassed an unparalleled record in sport : 522 victories in dual swimming meets , only twelve defeats . <P> In his long term at New Haven . Kiphuth produced dozens of topflight swimmers , and many were record breakers . Among them : Alan Ford , John Marshall , Jim McLane and Rex Aubrey in freestyle events . Allen Stack , Junie House and Dick Thoman in the backstroke . Tim Jecko in the butterfly . <P> Conditioning . Kiphuth 's secret is to train his swimmers on dry land . In his early years as coach , he traveled to Sweden and Japan to study bodybuilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself into a rigorous physical education program that all Yale swimmers must undergo before they take to the water for serious workouts . Under Kiphuth 's direction , they work for weeks on weights and pulleys in Yale 's immense Payne Whitney Gymnasium ( " the Temple of Sweat " ) . <P> Kiphuth concentrates on the arm depressors-muscles that pull the arms down . " The arm depressors must be strengthened for best results in pulling at the catch and to push through at the finish of the stroke , " he explains . " I 'm a great believer in swimming with the arms . " For hours on end Yale swimmers rhythmically flail their arms in Payne Whitney exercise rooms , lying on boards in swimming position and struggling with weights . <P> A stern taskmaster . Kiphuth demands all-out effort , is apt to roar at a swimmer dawdling through his paces : " If you want to take a bath , get a cake of soap . " During a hopping exercise , the coach scowled scornfully at a boy who had twisted an ankle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " But his swimmers like him . Says one : " A wishy-washy coach who sympathizes with you is no damn good . " <P> <P> Exploded Theory . Because Kiphuth feels he can coach better from poolside than by getting into the water with his boys , the legend for years was that he could not swim a stroke . The little ( 5 ft. 7 in. ) wiry man with the booming voice refuted the story at the Yale swimming carnival of 1948 when he abruptly leaped into the pool , swam its width to resounding cheers . Once he went to the bottom of the pool in a diving helmet for a fish-eye view , quickly corrected a flaw in the stroke of one of his swimmers . <P> Yale has not been beaten in dual swimming meets since 1945 , when a war-depleted team lost to Army . Last week Kiphuth was in his accustomed spot at poolside as his charges walloped Columbia 57-29-Yale 's 176th consecutive dual-meet victory , and notable only for the fact that it surpassed Kiphuth 's own earlier record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sadder milestone faces Kiphuth . He has reached Yale 's mandatory retirement age of 68 , will be forced to retire at the end of this season . Phil Moriarty. a trusted assistant for more than a quarter-century , will succeed him . To Yale swimmers , the Temple of Sweat will never be quite the same again .
