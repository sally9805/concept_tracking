THE tourist who decides for Moscow next year will risk his life , not in the dark cells of the Lubianka prison below Dzerzhinsky Square , but in the wildly undisciplined traffic above . Moscow 's streets are full of big , fast automobiles , all driven apparently by Sturmovik pilots intent on dive-bombing pedestrians . Or , as a recent visitor put it : " Dodging in and out of lanes , with nary a signal and with wild shouts of profanity at other cars , the Russian driver seems to be recapturing the elation felt by the Cossack of old when he swooped down from the steppes to carve up a few Persians . " <P> If there are traffic regulations , neither cops nor drivers heed them , nor do the pedestrians , who jaywalk and ignore traffic lights with grim fatalism . There is an incessant blowing of horns , but since all the horns sound alike ( apparently having been made in the same factory ) , the result is a constant and unidentifiable shriek , except for horns on the cars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first murmur of which the cops switch the manually operated traffic lights to green . Says U.S. Travel Expert John Stanton , just back from surveying the possibility of Cook 's touring through Russia : " In Moscow I always hesitated before starting across a street . They are so wide you are vulnerable for so long . " <P> A Sense of Power . If the amber lights now being shown by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. do not change to red in coming months , travel to Moscow should gain , travel experts estimate , by several hundred Americans next year . Russia , too , is sending forth travelers , but they are men with a mission , whether political , like Bulganin and Khrushchev in India ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , or cultural , like Violinist David Oistrakh ( see Music ) . Not for them the satisfaction of idle interests . <P> To the wandering American . Moscow , long hidden by the Iron Curtain , a source of conspiracy , strange dogmas and menacing dangers , is a legitimate object of U.S. curiosity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000.000 in surrounding suburbia , it is probably the third-largest city in the world . <P> <P> Western visitors will find their advent well prepared for . In the past seven years , a feverish activity has seized Moscow : broad new thoroughfares have been dynamited through the old quarters , big buildings have been lifted and put down in new alignments , broad plazas and parks have been created . Eight skyscrapers , 20 to 38 stories high , have sprung up like corn , and more than a million trees have been planted .
