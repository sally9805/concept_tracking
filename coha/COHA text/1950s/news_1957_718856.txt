txt Letters to The Times JOSEPH R. SHAW.RICHARD SCHUCKMAN.A . AITCHESS.RICHARD A. WILEY.THEODORE ALLEN ... Letters ' to The Times Jobless Pay Bill Backed  - -  -   - -  - Benefits Seen Both for Worker and Employer in Legislation To THE EDITOR OF THE nay YORK Truss : With the passage of the unemployment insurance bill by the New York State Legislature it now becomes abundantly clear that the only reason that Thomas Murray and Louis Hollander of the State Federation of Labor and C. I. 0 . Council , respectively , ' are against the omnibus unemployment insurance bill Is that employers are for it . None of the reasons stated in their letter appearing June 8 stand up in the light of hard facts . The omnibus bill would not assess " punitive higher taxation es wasonal and nonregular employers , " it would not be for the benefit of just a few " giant corporations " ? it would help rather than hurt small business , and it would be of particular benefit to the workingman . On the points raised the only authoritative source of factual information on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Division of Employment . Seasonal Firms The ' apparel industry is generally regarded as one of the most prominent among the seasonal industries . To be specific , we are concerned here with only a portion of this industry comprising 6,316 firms , or approximately only 40 per cent of all apparel firms . These are the " negative balance " firms surviving in 1956 . In 1955,4for example , there were 10,152 employers who were responsible for the drain on the fund of $44 million in benefits while they paid only $10 million in taxes . Is it punitive to ask these employers to pay approximately $1 million more ? ? To imply that this bill would benefit only a few " giant corporations " is to completely distort the facts . The tax provisions-of this bill would benefit business , large and small . The Labor Department report shows that the vast majority of employers in the unemployment insurance program are definitely in the smallfirm category , since approximately more than nine out of ten of them employ less than 100 people . Grouping employers into nine categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in each of six small business categories ( up to $200,000 paytoll ) a very substantial majority of employers are stable enough to enjoy a favorable tax under experience rating . Therefore , they would clearly benefit under the bill . Majority Benefited For example , the construction industry has been cited as one likely to suffer from the alleged " punitive taxation " of the bill . The Labor Department records show that two-thirds of the 12,365 employers as of July 1 , 1955 , qualifying for experience rating in the industry would be paying less under the proposed tax change . Thus the claims that this bill would hurt the little fellow are blasted by the official statistics . In 1955 maximum weekly unemployment insurance benefits were increased from $30 to $36 . The omnibus bill would up the maximum to $45 ? for a 50 per cent jump in the short space of two years . Under this bill the workingman in this state would have a higher maximum , excluding dependency provisions , than the overwhelming majority of his fellow-employes throughout the country . We in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence action on this measure by Governor Harriman reflecting the support for this bill . JOSEPH R. SHAW . President , Associated Industries of New York State , Inc . Albany , June 13 , 1957 . To Stop Nuclear Testings . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TINIF , S : The appalling predictions of Dr. Linus Pauling on the effects of fall-out from nuclear tests are not merely " guesstimates , " as Philip B. Armstrong 's letter to the New York Times states . It has been demonstrated that radioactive strontium is a precursor of cancer of the bone and other serious ailments . At the present time no scientist can state what dosage is required to inflict permanent injury . Our generation could produce " a point of no return " for future generations . If we heed Dr , Pauling 's predictions and stop nuclear testings we can save mankind . RICHARD SCHUCKMAN . Fairlawn , N. J. , June 11 , 1957 . Suggestions for Mao To TtIE EDITOR OF THENEW YORK TIMES : I have read in The New York Times of Mao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has not liquidated  --  birthrate vs. stable population ; population vs. educational facilities and the growth in quantities of food produced vs. the growth in the numbers of people . He also seems concerned in substituting , ' , ' persuasion and education " for " methods of terror . " I offer the following suggestions , which should appeal to the poetic side of his character : organize a vast number of teams to cover , all sections of the land . Take every child under the age of 2 and hang it by its toes from the nearest tree to where the parents live  --  it would be beth cruel and anti-social to make the senior members of the family walk too far to where the child is hanging . Each day they must tell the child More of the beauties of communism . A.U.water and food should be saved for those who are actively employed and not shared with these junior students ? as Lenin said , " Waste not , want not . " By the time the team of teachers returns to the site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should release the child so that the tree be not ruined , and of course execute in a persuasive manner any parents who have not fully cooperated in the educational system . The results will meet all of Mao 'S present suggestions  --  he will not be guilty of sowing a wrong seed ; there will be population control , food conservation and plenty of education . Of course the foregoing will have its negative as well as its positive side . It might stimulate trade . A. AITCHESS . New York , June 13 , 1957 . Return of German Assets Release of Property Said to Be in Effect a Cost to Taxpayer To THE EDITOR OF THE New York TIMER : The financial columns of The Times of June 3 included a dispatch by your correspondent at Zurich , George H. Morison , concern , ing the price rise of Interhandel stock on the Zurich Exchange . The report stated that the Johnston bill presently before the Senate envisages the release of all German ; Japanese and neutral privately owned property seized in the United States during World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American taxpayer . " First , we must assume that the Johnston bill referred to is Senate . 600 for the return of the assets rather than Senate 1639 , another Johnston bill providing for the staying of the Alien Property Custodian from any further transactions in the enemy assets . Second , it should be made clear that the return of the German assets , at least , will be made at no cost to the American taxpayer only in the sense that no new appropriation will have to be made for the payment of American war damage claims . The return will be at a cost to the American taxpayer because the Johnston bill , Senate 600 , envisages payment of American war damage claims from the repay ments to be made by Germany under the London Debt Settlement - Agreement of 1953 of both principal and interest in discharge of loans for post-war economic assistance made to her by the United States . If the American war damage claims are not paid out of the repayments of the economic assistance loans , these repayments will be coy- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a credit to the taxpayer . The Paris Reparation Agreement of 1946 , the Bonn Convention of 1952 and the War Claims . Act of 1948 all contemplated that .. American war damage claims would be paid from the sale of the seized assets and would thus be discharged at no cost to the American taxpayer . RICHARD A. WILEY . Boston , June 4 , 1957 . Subway Inconvenience Cited To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Let me join you in congratulating Transit Authority Chairman Charles L. Patterson on reversing the Times Square subway entrance decision , And let me ask your help in bringing to his attention ( other means have been tried and have failed ) another case where a decision with a commendable purpose is working a hardship on a substantial number of subway users . In the " bad old days " on the Independent subway system trains of both the Sixth and Eighth Avenue lines came into each level of the Fourth Street-Washington Square Station . Recently this has been changed so that a passenger traveling. on the Sixth Avenue ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an A or other Eighth Avenue train , has to climb two flights of stairs instead of , as formerly , simply walking across the platform at the , same level . Changing from Eighth to Sixth likewise requires passengers to walk down two flights of stairs . Yes , two , for there is a mezzanine between the stations . While I have no traffic count figures , casual observation will convince anyone that this new and needless inconvenience affects several thousand persons daily . THEODORE ALLEN JOHNSON , New York , June 10 , 1957.
