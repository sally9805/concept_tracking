AN ALMANAC OF LIBERTY , by William O. Douglas ( 409 pp. ; Doubleday ; $5.50 ) , is remarkable chiefly because it takes one of the year 's pleasantest publishing ideas and turns it into a bore . Almanac-browsing is a lost pleasure to most Americans , and this attempt to revive it looks promising-until the reader actually starts to browse . Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas , prolific writer about his rambles in the Far East , has struck off 366 little devotional essays on American liberty for the " common man 's " year ( which seems always to be leap year ) . Author Douglas almost immediately slogs down in pompous , naive paragraphs about public libraries , workmen 's compensation , irrigation . Notwithstanding a few well-phrased obiter dicta on civil rights , he simply does not have the Alma-knack . <P> A WOMAN IN BERLIN , Anonymous ( 319 pp. ; Harcourt , Brace ; $4 ) , is the stark diary of a genteel blonde who tells about her experiences during the Russians ' nightmare conquest of Berlin . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in groups , the Russians prowled through the rubble-strewn city in search of women . After being raped four times in two days , the anonymous author of the diary decided to find a strong wolf to protect her from the pack . Protection came at the customary price , first from a lieutenant , then from a major ( of whom she eventually became quite fond ) . When the savage wave of rape ended and women met to talk , the first question was not " What happened ? " but " How often ? " Intent throughout on survival , the blonde diarist wound up singing , " What does n't kill me makes me stronger . " Her diary is a vivid document of conquest and defeat , and a telling demonstration of how most Germans feel about Russians and why . <P> THE BORMANN LETTERS , edited by H. R. Trevor-Roper ( 200 pp. ; British Book Centre ; $3.75 ) , a selection from correspondence between Hitler 's mysterious " Brown Eminence " and his wife , is a fascinating document of the dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " My dearest Mummy-Girl " ) that Martin Bormann ( still missing after years of Allied search ) was a human being-if a horribly peculiar one . The Bormanns raised a perfect Aryan family of nine , taking care that " none of our children gets depraved and diseased by the poison of Christianity . " One day in January 1944 , Bormann jubilantly informed his wife that he had succeeded in seducing the actress " M. " " Lucky fellow ! - now I . . . feel doubly and unbelievably happily married . " Gerda Bormann responded like a true Nazi consort . " You will have to see to it that one year M. has a child , and the next year I , so that you will always have a wife who is mobile . " She urged that bigamy be legalized " as at the end of the Thirty Years ' war . " But the war did not last 30 years . After performing the last rites at the Fhrer 's funeral pyre in beaten Berlin , Bormann disappeared . His wife died in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoctrination , seven of their children have become Roman Catholics . The eldest , Hitler 's godson , is training to become a priest .
