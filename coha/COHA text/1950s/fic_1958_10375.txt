grinned and relaxed as he cut the ropes that held the two packs . Powhatan was a man with whom he could deal , and he knew of no complications that would prevent them from enjoying a mutually profitableassociation . Ru-Sa toyed nervously with the thick single braid of hair hanging over her left shoulder that showed she was a grandmother , and she wished , not for the first time , that she had never accepted her position as custodian of the Chief of Chiefs ' only daughter . Originally she had thought her duties would be light , as the girl was mature now and consequentlydid not require either a nurse or a serving maid . But there were times when Pocahontas would try the patience of the gods , and this was one of them . It would have been better for the girl , Ru-Sa reflected , if she had not been the one female in a family of many boys . It was unfortunate , too , that she was so attractive , and even worse that she knew it . She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at her father 's lodge , and Ru-Sa , sighing , had to admit that it was terribly difficult to chastise anyone so lovely . Pocahontas 's features were delicately feminine , but Ru-Sa knew from experience that her gentle mouth could become hard when her will was crossed , and that her soft brown eyes , which the young warriors praised so lavishly on the feast nights when they composedsongs in her honor , could blaze when she was vexed . It was sometimeshard to realize that a girl who looked so demure could be so headstrong . At the moment she looked particularly shy and modest , almost like a child . Her hair , so black it showed blue highlights when the sun shone on it , fell loosely down her back and was held in place smoothly at the crown of her head by a narrow band of calfskin decorated with tiny white seeds that identified her as a maiden . Her calf-length tunic , like those of all Chickahominy women , was made of two pieces of soft deerskin , but Pocahontas 's garment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form tassels . Even the daughter of the great Powhatan had no real right to display such symbols of rank , but the Chief of Chiefs himself sometimes encouraged her to flout traditions . Obviously she enjoyed defying custom in every way she could , for the unsewn , overlapping sides of her tunic were belted with a wide buckskin sash which was secured by another large tassel of brightly coloredthongs . Other girls were always aware of their proper place in the community and took care to keep in the background at all times , but Pocahontasp51actually seemed to take pride in her unusual beauty . Ru-Sa thought bitterlythat it was no wonder the young braves always stared at her when she walked down to the river . Her clothes certainly were not responsible , for they were very much like those of the other maidens , even though she insisted on flaunting the tassels , and Ru-Sa concluded that it was the way she carried herself that made the difference . She seemed to be conscious of her broad shoulders , high breasts , and slender waist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation of herself made the young warriors aware of her too . Yet Ru-Sa had to concede , as she often did to her friends , that the girl 's conduct was decorous ; at no time had she behaved in a manner that would cause her to be sent to the lodge where the Women Without Virtue were kept . Although nearly every brave in the Confederation who had won the three feathers of valor entitling him to take a wife had courted her , she was still chaste . But she certainly could be mischievous enough to drive others to distraction . Right now she was laughing softly to herself as she concealed herself behind the flap . She had kicked off her moccasins , and the way her bare toes curled and wriggled was positively indecent . Ru-Sa lost what remained of her patience and could keep silent no longer . " Pocahontas , " she said irritably , " come away from the entrance at once ! " The girl giggled more loudly but did not move . " Did you see him , Ru-Sa ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatically . " Then you missed a sight as wonderful as the flowering of the buds when the snows melt . " Her feet were still , but her toes seemed to be dancing . " He saw me too . I know he did . He looked straight at me . " Ru-Sa was shocked . " You are the daughter of the Chief of Chiefs . " " So I am , " Pocahontas replied comfortably . " Every maiden of the Chickahominy will want to meet him , but I shall meet him first . " " I forbid you to talk like one of those women who live in the lodgeby-the-water . I forbid it , do you hear ? " The girl turned , her eyes round and innocent . " Is it wrong to greet one who has come from afar , Ru-Sa ? " " Your father has two wives who will welcome the stranger if the great Powhatan wishes our women to make him comfortable . " " It was I who prepared the dish of buffalo and young corn for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and I am young . " " What does that mean ? " Ru-Sa asked indignantly . " He , too , is young and very beautiful . The eyes of the old are dim , and only the young may see each other clearly . " The old woman was genuinely distressed . " Pocahontas , you are wicked ,  |p52and  if you think such thoughts the great god Ris will come down from the moon to punish you . Perhaps even the all-seeing , all-knowing Ek will --  " " Do you suppose that Ek and Ris do not know of this man ? " the girl retorted . " Do you suppose they do not shine down on him and watch over him in whatever strange place he makes his home ? I want to know more of such places , Ru-Sa . I want to learn all there is to know about all people ! " " You will become the squaw of a chief , as is fitting for the daughter of the great Powhatan , and you will give many fine , strong sons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to sound convincing . Pocahontas stamped her foot , and a dangerous gleam appeared in her eyes . " You would not talk that way if you had seen him ! Everything about him was different . I see the braves of many nations when they come here to pay homage to my father , but not one of them looks like him . His clothes , his hair , his moccasins  --  even the long knife that he carried at his side  --  were strange and wonderful . " " It may be , " the elderly custodian said fearfully , " that he is one of the devil-gods who live beneath the earth . " The idea was so absurd that Pocahontas laughed merrily . " He is a man , " she replied emphatically . " All the more reason --  " " Besides , I do not hold to the old beliefs . How do you know there are devil-gods below the earth ? Have you ever seen them ? Has anyone ever seen them ? " Ru-Sa covered her ears with her hands , averted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Pocahontas was satisfied ; the foe was routed , and there was no need for further conversation on the subject . She walked lightly to her own side of the room and sat down on her bough bed . For a moment or two she stared thoughtfully into space . Then she jumped to her feet again and feverishly began to rearrange her hair in front of a small square of burnished metal that rested on one of the horizontal poles holding up the wall . She swept the long locks to one side , braided them , coiled them over her right ear , and secured them with a comb made of white bone . Behind her , in the corner , was a shelf of woven reeds , and after rummagingaround on it hastily , she found what she was seeking and removedher dress . Then , no longer in a hurry , she smiled dreamily as she put on a handsome costume of two pieces in its place . The top was ap53deep , capelike collar of kidskin , completely covered with rows of blueblackshells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snugly over her shoulders and stopped a few inches below her breasts , leaving her diaphragm bare , and below it she wore a narrow skirt of cream kidskin , slit at the bottom on each side , which hung from a seeded hip band decorated in the same fashion as her collar . Sitting again , she slid her feet into flat thick buckskin soles and began to lace their orange-dyed thongs to her ankles . Ru-Sa , aware for the first time of what she was doing , stared across the hut at her in horror . " What are you doing ? " " I changed my clothes , " Pocahontas said quietly . " That is the ceremonial dress of Ris and is only to be worn at the feasts each month when Ris shows us his full face . " " Ris has seen me in this dress before . " The girl stood , straightened her skirt , and started toward the entrance . " You will offend the moon god , " the old woman wailed . " Something pretty can offend no one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And this dress is very pretty . I know the stranger will agree . You will see . " For a moment Ru-Sa was too startled to react ; then she hurried after her charge . " You must not interrupt the great Powhatan when he is in council with a warrior from a distant land . " Pocahontas evaded her custodian 's grasp and ran out into the open , laughing . Two or three braves and several members of the stranger 's party were gathered in a clearing below her house , demonstrating their skill with long metal spears that belonged to the foreigners . She inspected the visitors briefly , and immediately lost interest in them . As she had suspected , their skins were pale , like that of their leader , but they lacked his beauty and virility . She knew that all of the men had stopped throwingspears and were watching her , so in spite of her exuberance she forced herself to walk at a slow , dignified pace , her hips swaying a little as she climbed to the crest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger were deeply engrossed in conversation and did not see her , so she crept closer to them , hoping they would look up . Women were not allowed to speak when in the presence of men until they were granted permission , and her father would be very angry if she failed to remember her proper place . Within certain limits she knew she could do as she pleased and that he would approve , but the least sign of disrespect always made him violently angry . Her best tactic , she thought , would be to halt near them and wait until they happened top54glance in her direction . In the meantime , she told herself , there was nothing to prevent her from staring at the stranger as much as she pleased , and her heart pounded furiously . Smith was the first to realize that someone else had come into the building , and he looked up casually , then promptly forgot what he was saying . He was always sensitive to a pretty face and a well-turned figure , and the girl standing no more than six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen since his last night in London . He warned himself to be careful , however , for Powhatan became aware of her presence , too , and the fond , proprietary look in his eye indicated that she might be one of his wives . " Why are you here ? " the Chief of Chiefs asked brusquely , trying to hide the pleasure he always felt when he saw her . Pocahontas crossed her hands over her breasts and looked down at the ground . " The mothers and grandmothers of the women of the Chickahominy , and their mothers and grandmothers before them , " she said meekly , " were charged by the gods to give food and drink to all who come as friends . I , too , bear that charge . " Her mock humility did not fool Powhatan . He knew precisely why she had come to the lodge , and he frowned for a moment , then reconsidered . He studied the girl and his guest in turn , and Pocahontas , who knew him so well that she could always divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections if the pale warrior chose to pay court to her . What she did not know was that Powhatan 's thoughts were more complex than she imagined ; he was reflecting that her appearance might soften this shrewd visitor , for he was discovering that Smith drove a hard bargain and was demanding considerable quantities of the best furs as well as food in return for his powerful noise-making weapons . " Smith , King of James , " the Chief of Chiefs said , " Pocahontas is the daughter of Powhatan . " John Smith , jumping to his feet as he acknowledged the introduction , told himself sternly to watch his step . He had philandered successfully and discreetly with others ' wives on occasion and had escaped detection , but a man 's daughter was untouchable , particularly when the man was as powerful as Powhatan . Yet even the cautious Smith could not help but respond to the charming and radiant girl who stood before him and , removing his hat , he swept the ground with it in a gallant bow . To his astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking in dismay at his hat . He was annoyed , for the plumes had been expensive ; if he remembered correctly , they had each cost three gold angels , far more than he could afford.  |p55Powhatan  looked at the headgear , too , and his face became grim . " No young brave , " he said sternly , " becomes a full warrior until he slays three enemies . He may not enjoy the rights of a man until he has been awarded three feathers . " Smith understood and grinned broadly . " We have different customs , " he said , addressing the chief but speaking for the benefit of Pocahontas . " I have killed so many enemies in battle that I have lost count of the number . " That was n't the strict truth , of course , but details were unimportantwhen he was trying to impress a girl . Powhatan accepted the statement without bothering to demand proof . No man , obviously , could become a chief until he had demonstrated his valor , and the ways of the **29;229;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What bothered the chief was the unmistakable reaction of his daughter ; she made no attempt to hide her relief , and he decided to tell her later , in private , that she would need to learn the art of dissembling . A man often became frightened and rejecteda woman when she showed him her feelings too clearly . But even as Powhatan looked at her , he changed his mind , for he suddenly realizedthere was little he could teach Pocahontas that she did not already know . A sudden transformation seemed to take place in her , and she looked shyly at the ground . " Does Smith wish food to ease his hunger or drink to still his thirst ? " she asked , both her manner and voice indicating that she was the most fragile of creatures . " Smith , " the captain replied heartily , " has already eaten a delicious meal . He was told by the brother of Pocahontas that she prepared it with her own hands , and Smith is grateful to her . " There were a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been saving them until the end of the meeting , but he walked quickly to the bundle and , reachinginside , brought out two rolls of cloth . One was a thick , unbleached wool , of the sort the colonists used to make blankets and children 's clothes , and the other was a bright blue satin that most of the settlers considered too garish . " Smith is grateful to the daughter of Powhatan for the favor she has shown him , " he said , handing her the bolts with a flourish . Pocahontas 's dainty fingers caressed the materials , the first she had ever felt . The wool was even softer than the finest leather , and the silk was so sleek and glossy that it excited her . It would be undignified , she knew , to burst into tears , and she made a desperate effort to control her emotions . " Never has Pocahontas been given such wonderful gifts , " she said , her voice trembling  |p56Smith  looked so pleased that Powhatan decided to adjourn the trade discussion until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to his feet , he walked to the entrance at the rear of the lodge that he alone used . " When Ris , the moon god , appears , " he said , " Powhatan will share a feast with Smith , and Pocahontas will prepare it . When Ek shines again , there will be more talk of weapons and furs and grain . We have spoken much of furs and grains . Tomorrow , " he added , " we will speak of weapons . " He was gone , and Smith was alone with the girl . She stood smiling at him and hugging the rolls of cloth , and she looked so attractive that he had to remind himself forcibly that she was his host 's daughter . He felt more comfortable when she broke the spell by offering to show him the community and the surrounding countryside , and he accepted quickly . Pocahontas left her gifts in her own house as they started down the hill and then guided him around the village . Smith was interested in everything he saw and wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives traded goods with each other , and the communal farms , where some of the squaws grew corn and vegetables for all , but the girl gave him no chance to speak of these things . She bombarded him with questions about his own world , which he could only describe to her with difficulty , and no sooner did he satisfy her curiosity on one subject than she launched into another . She gave him no opportunity to enjoy the stir he created wherever they walked , and when he discovered that the natives whom they passed stared as hard at Pocahontas as they did at him , he felt faintly nettled . Nevertheless , her eagerness to learn , her readiness to accept whatever he told her gave him an increased sense of self-importance . He could not recall the time when a woman had made him feel so wise , and when they returned to the high hill he realized that her company stimulated him enormously . It was pleasant to bask in the adulation of a young pretty girl , but at the same time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had come to the interior . It occurred to him that he might be able to turn the impression he was making on Pocahontas to his advantage ; he had observed that her father doted on her , so it was possible that through her he might be able to obtain better terms in his negotiations with Powhatan , who was the most realistically astute bargainer he had ever encountered . Pocahontas had appreciated his gift of the bolts of cloth so much that he wondered what else he might give her to bind her even more firmly to him , and after pondering the matter for several minutes he haltedp57abruptly , told her he had an errand to perform , and promised to rejoin her shortly . The huts in which his men had been quartered were nearby , and he was momentarily disappointed when he saw they had all gone off somewhere , but that did not stop him from searching their belongings . He hoped that some of them had brought books with them on the journey , for Pocahontas seemed to be a girl with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered that kind of woman and he was sure nothing would flatter her more than to pander to her belief that she possessed an intellect . After hastily looking through the packs of some of his men , he found a thick copy of the Bible and quickly leafed through it . It was the so-called " Bishops ' Bible , " containing both the Old and New Testaments , and although Smith had not read it in many years , he had been nevertheless familiar with it from his childhood , as it was used in all English churches . He wished he could give Pocahontas something livelier , but when he saw that the Bible was illustrated throughout with crude but effective pictures of characters dressed in clothing reminiscent of the reign of Henry VIII , he decided it would suffice . Taking it with him , he climbed to his own quarters and there picked up the handbook of Indian words and phrases that Sir Walter Raleigh had given him . The glossary was much larger now than it had been when he had first received it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since his visit to the Pamaunke , and he thought that perhaps Pocahontas , by using it in reverse , might with patience glean a smattering of English . She was waiting for him at the entrance to her house , and she stood aside like a well-bred squaw so he could precede her into the room . An old woman was squatting in a far corner , and he was somewhat surprised to see that she was glaring at him . It annoyed him to be encumberedby the presence of a chaperone , but as Pocahontas ignored the old woman , he did the same . They sat together on the ground in the center of the room , and he showed her the glossary , carefully explained how to use it , and told her he was lending it to her until his next visit to the land of the Chickahominy . He intended to publish a complete handbook of the native tongues when he returned to England , so he had no intention of allowingher to keep it permanently . He was pleased to see that the glossary fascinated her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to absorbthe principles of the alphabet . Then he gave her the Bible as a gift ,  |p58and  he knew when he saw her ecstatic face that his impulse had been brilliant . Powhatan 's trade terms would unquestionably be more generouswhen he learned of his daughter 's joy . Pocahontas did not thank him but instead turned to the old woman in the corner . " Ru-Sa will go , " she said firmly . The custodian sighed deeply , stood , and walked slowly out of the room , shaking her head . And Smith , who was startled , could only conclude that Pocahontas was expressing her gratitude in the only way she knew by openly inviting him to make love to her . Dalliance with the daughter of the Chief of Chiefs could lead to countless troublesome complications , and he struggled briefly with himself as she walked to a shelf on the far side of the room , took something from it , and then rejoinedhim . She sat down again close to him , and Smith fought a losing battle against temptation . Night was falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became increasingly conscious of her beauty . No man could resist such an opportunity , regardless of the problems that might result , and he shifted his position slightly so that they now sat side by side . Pocahontas , aware of his nearness , hid her elation . Ru-Sa and the squaws of her brothers loved to tell her that she was ignorant of the ways of men , but she had long felt that she had a special gift , that she possessed a sure , instinctive knowledge that would enable her to handle any warrior . Even though Smith 's eyes were guarded and his movements controlled , she knew he was as interested in her as the young braves who watched her so avidly whenever they saw her . Smith , as befitted a mature warrior , concealed his admiration , but she was n't deceived . She wished her brothers ' wives could see her at this moment , then perhaps they would stop their ceaseless prattling . But in the next breath she decided their presence would spoil everything , for she certainly did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year she had sometimes joined the very young braves when they tested their strength and skill in games , and she had occasionally allowed one or another of them to kiss her , until her father had learned of the practice and had abruptly put an end to it . She had n't cared , as none of the youths had meant anything to her , and she had n't particularly enjoyed the experience with them . But there was no comparison between those callow warriors and Smith , and she felt an almost overwhelming desire to be kissed by him . No sooner did she recognize her own feelings , however , than a sensep59of panic swept over her . Perhaps Ru-Sa was right , perhaps she would someday be sent to the lodge of the Women Without Virtue . Smith 's desire for her , which was so obvious to her , was very flattering , but she was the daughter of the Chief of Chiefs and she had to act accordingly . She would encourage him but she would remind him that she was no ordinary woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift on him . Then he would understand perfectly . She smiled and held out her right hand , pleased that the impulse that had led her to get something for him a few moments ago had been right . " Smith has given me so much that I must give him something in return , " she said softly . He nodded and moistened his lips , which were suddenly dry . Then he realized that she was holding an object in her hand , and he took it from her . As nearly as he could make out in the twilight , it was a hollow reed , approximately four inches long and roughly the thickness of his little finger . One end had been carved into the shape of a mouthpiece , and in the center had been burned several concentric circles , the symbol of the sun god . He stared at it blankly , and Pocahontas reached out , caught hold of his wrist , and shook the reed gently . The tip of a tiny arrow appeared at the open end , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " are not permitted to use the weapons of mighty warriors . So I must protect myself with this blow arrow , which has been dipped in the poison of the snake-that-rattles . I give it to Smith , so he will rememberPocahontas . " Seeing him hesitate , she added more firmly , " Take it . I have others . " They looked at each other intently . Smith , who had been about to slide his free arm around her waist , let his hand fall limply to his side . Some of the girls due to arrive soon from England might interest him , he thought ; if not , he had seen a few Indian women on the seacoast who were mildly attractive . " I will rememberPocahontas , " he said , and told himself he was guilty of understatement.  |p60Thanks  to John Smith 's foresight and planning , one hundred and twenty new colonists who arrived at Jamestown , some in the winter and some in early spring , were spared most of the inconveniences and discomforts that the agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia . They came ashore from the Susan Constant and her new sister ship , the Phoenix , with feelings of mixed anticipation and dread , ready to return home at once if life in America proved to be too primitive . To their astonishment they were quartered in sturdy , simplehouses that had already been built for them , each family was given ample provisions of corn and dried meat from the community 's bulging storehouses , and each received a fair share of the fresh supplies the barks had carried in their holds . Other equally pleasant surprises awaited the recruits too . Friends of several Council members in England had been spreading the rumor that Captain Smith was a despot who had to be replaced as president if the colony was to survive , but the new arrivals quickly discovered that he was no tyrant . He visited every house , and his interviews , which would have been stiff and formal had he possessed less tact , were pleasant social occasions . He assigned men with military experience to guard duty , farmers went to work growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily resumed the practice of their old trades . The men were delighted that he was so reasonable , and the women , captivated by his charm , eagerly accepted the menial tasks he allotted to them . He wisely made no overt attempt to impress the captains of the barks , who would carry word of the colony 's progress back to the directors of the London Company , and he was undisturbed by the secret complaintsp61of his enemies , as he knew his accomplishments spoke for themselves . Jamestown showed great promise of becoming the first permanent English settlement in the New World , and Smith was certain he would rightfully receive the credit for achieving what no one , not even Sir Walter Raleigh , had been able to do before him . He took care , however , to speak modestly of his success at the farewell dinner he gave for the masters of the ships shortly before they sailed back to England in May , and he carefully emphasized the view that the future of the colony was still precarious . His unassuming air made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his cleverness in warding off their attacks encouraged him to end his speech on an even more somber note . A single error in judgment , he said , could ruin the whole enterprise , but he assured the ship captains that he had no intention of making that mistake . The Susan Constant and the Phoenix sailed the following morning , but Smith wasted no time congratulating himself on the brilliance of his maneuvers . His fame in England seemed to be assured , yet there had been a measure of truth in what he had told the captains : Jamestown was not yet self-sufficient , and there was much work still to be done . He was anxious to consolidate his gains , and the new settlers added to his problems ; there were more mouths to feed , more lives to protect . The best means of insuring their well-being and safety was through increased trade and friendship with the natives , and so , even before the barks disappearedover the horizon , he sent a Chesapeake messenger to the interiorwith a flattering invitation to Powhatan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , requested the honor of a return visit from the mighty Chief of Chiefs . Powhatan accepted promptly , sending word back to the colony that he would arrive in a moon 's time , and Smith made careful preparations for the event . The Council was horrified by his disclosure that he intended to trade a cannon for a year 's supply of grain , but no one could refute his logical arguments . It would be many months , he pointed out , before the colony would grow all of the food the present residents needed , and by that time still another company of settlers would arrive from England . Common sense dictated the necessity of keeping the storehouses filled , for there was no guarantee that the weather would continue to favor the settlers ' crops.It was already very warm , the summer might be hot and dry , and a single poor season could mean ultimate starvation for all . He was not going to give the Indians either of the new guns that thep62barks had just brought from England , he told the Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away one or even two old outmoded culverins . These little cannon , which threw small iron balls weighing seventeen pounds , were no longer used by civilized artillery corps because their fire was notoriously inaccurate , and Smith further emphasized that they would be virtually useless in the event of war with the Naturals . Battles would inevitably take place in the forests rather than on open plains , which seemed to be nonexistent in America , hence a culverin 's small shot would be ineffective against a foe protected by tall trees . Captain Archer led the opposition to the plan , as usual , but he becameconfused when Smith sardonically explained that the ammunition of the new cannon , which weighed sixty pounds , would crash through trees and kill an enemy where a culverin 's shot would not . And the discussionended abruptly when Smith , in exasperation , declared that even a semieducated Christian required the better part of a year 's instruction before he became a trained gunner ; how then , he asked , could illiterate savages inflict damage on anyone , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arsenal ? The Council , shamed , voted him the right to deal with the Chickahominy as he saw fit . One of the larger houses was vacated for Powhatan , and two smaller dwellings were made ready for the rest of his party . Hunters shot deer , bear , and buffalo , and Smith privately assigned two younger men to kill some wild dogs for the guests too . The day before the Indians were due to arrive , a former fisherman from Dover went out into Chesapeake Bay at dawn and came back at sunset , his boat filled with oysters , clams , and the crabs of the New World , which had curiously soft shells . The presidenthimself brought down a brace of quail which he proposed to serve to the Chief of Chiefs and himself as a dish of special distinction , and the housewives used their precious wheat flour lavishly to bake bread and pastries for visitors who had never tasted such delicacies . The entire town was ready to welcome the guests shortly after breakfast , but it was noon before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the James River and heralded the arrival of the Naturals . Smith had guessed that Powhatan might be accompanied by twenty or thirty warriors and had made plans accordingly , but even he was astonished at the size of the chief 's entourage . There were sixty braves in the guard of honor , and the settlers in the watchtower at the main gate counted seventeen elders in the party too . The June heat was intense , but all of the natives wore heavy cloaks , and that of Powhatan , which wasp63made entirely of feathers sewn close together on buffalo skin , looked particularly stifling . Bringing up the rear was a canoe carrying three women , and the colonists , who had been prepared to entertain only men and had consequentlymade no preparations for female guests , were dismayed . But Smith was unperturbed when the news was reported to him at the parade ground , where he and the others of the Council , backed by three files of pikemen , waited to receive the Indians . He met the emergency by asking Edward Wingfield to vacate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair one that it could not be refused ; Wingfield had continued to live in the large and comfortable home he had first occupied by virtue of the position he had then held as the principal executive officer of the colony , and as Smith had never tried to dispossesshim , he felt that the least he could do now was to comply . He hurried off to remove his belongings from the two-story building , while his colleagues , perspiring in their close-fitting doublets and thick multiple " cabbage " ruffs , watched the main gate through which the guests would come . The first to appear were four brawny warriors in loincloths , and Smith noted at once that their faces and bodies were daubed with concentriccircles of yellow paint , which signified that they had come on a mission of peace . Behind them marched two of Powhatan 's sons , bearing gifts ; then came the rest of the braves , who jostled each other and made no attempt to maintain even a semblance of a military formation as they returned the stares of the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his features expressionless , as his feathered headgearwaved gently in the warm breeze . The elders , who helped him administer the affairs of the many tribes he governed , were close at his heels , and some distance behind them came several slaves , young men who had been captured in battle . They wore neither headpieces nor robes , the crisscrossed marks of beatings they had received were plainly visible on their backs , and apparently they had been included in the party merely to act as custodians for a number of goats , whom they led by ropes made of plaited vines . Some distance behind the animals were two middle-aged women in calf-length dresses of deerskin ; they looked vaguely familiar to Smith , who finally identified them as the wives of the Chief of Chiefs . For a moment he thought the initial reports on the number of women in the entourage had been wrong , but then he saw the settlers murmur in shocked excitementas they stared at the very tail end of the procession . Peeringp64past the two squaws , he felt a surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she knew she was the center of attention , she gave no sign of it , and Smith , who realized that she was inordinately curious , marveled at her aplomb . She looked straight ahead , not bothering to glance at the men and women about whom she had asked him so many questions , and she seemed to be unaware that she , of all the strangely attired savages , was creating the greatest sensation . The furor she caused was certainly justified , Smith thought , and by any standards she looked appealing . Her hair was held smoothly on the crown of her head by a maiden 's band of deerskin sewn with white seeds , and two thick braids were looped to form large rings behind her ears . But her clothing , judged by the conservative standards of the settlers , was considerably less than decent . She wore a breastband of sand-colored kidskin , and below her bare diaphragm was a tightly wrapped skirt of pale kidskin which fell to her knees and was fastened on one hip by a carved sliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen of the Council gaped at her , and Smith found it difficult to control a grin as he stepped forward to exchange ceremonial greetings with Powhatan . The addresses of welcome were interminable , and each member of the Council felt impelled to add something to the occasion . The Naturals , not to be outdone in courtesy , replied in kind , and the elders took turns echoing the flowery words of their chief . Smith was kept busy translating for both groups , but he was as bored as the spectators , as restless as the Indian warriors , and in spite of his desire to maintain the dignity befittinghis position , he kept shifting his weight from one foot to the other on the bare , heat-dried earth of the parade ground . During the first half hour or more of the ceremonies he could not see Pocahontas , as she was hidden somewhere at the rear of the huddle of visitors , but he became aware of her again during an especially dull speech that Matthew Scrivener had laboriously written and now insisted on making . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their goats , and was looking intently at Smith . Feeling her eyes on him , he looked up and realized at once that she had changed her position so she could obtain an unobstructed view of him . He nodded to her rather stiffly , annoyed with himself because he felt his blood racing , and she responded instantly by smiling at him . He could not recall ever having seen such pure pleasure on the face of another person , and for no good reason he remembered his words of farewell to the captains of the barks . A singleP65mistake could mean the end of Jamestown , and he told himself firmly that he must not forget it , no matter how great the provocation . Not even the hardiest , most determined speakers could talk indefinitelyin the enervating heat , and at last the ceremonies drew to a close . The Indians were shown to the quarters that had been made ready for them and they promptly reshuffled the arrangements to their own satisfactionand the amazement of their hosts . Powhatan kept the largest house for himself but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never before slept in a place built with such strange openings , and they made him uneasy . His sons took one of the smaller homes , the elders crowded into Edward Wingfield 's house , and the remainingdwelling was given to Pocahontas . Smith offered to make other buildings available , but his guests cheerfully refused and erected a numberof tents on a portion of the parade ground for those who had no other shelter . This group included the young braves , the slaves , and Powhatan 's wives , who shared a small tent near the pen that was put up for the goats . A banquet was served in midafternoon , and most of the visitors ate heartily and indiscriminately . Smith noticed , however , that Powhatan only nibbled at the dishes placed before him , and when the meal ended he left so hurriedly that some of the Englishmen thought he was offended . To their infinite amusement he went out to the parade ground ; there the slaves had slaughtered a goat , his wives had stewed it over an open fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the whole community . Plainly the goats were intended for his private fare , and he did not care who watched him eat . His unusual personal habits did not interfere with his ability to drive a sharp bargain , however , as Smith discovered the following morning , after an evening of fruitless discussion in which both the Chickahominy elders and the members of the Jamestown Council took part . That meetingwas a repetition of the earlier exchange of addresses ; every man present was anxious to express his own views , and nothing tangible was accomplished . Smith and Powhatan therefore met privately after breakfast , and in an atmosphere devoid of rhetoric they spent the day maneuvering cautiously . By the time they parted shortly before sundown , each had received a little less than he wanted and had been forced to part with a little more than he had intended to give . The Chickahominy agreed to supply Jamestownwith eight hundred sacks of grain and two hundred baskets of dried meat ; the settlers contracted to give the Indians two culverins , fifty mus-P66kets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , Powhatan himself was to receive a steel helmet and a pearl-handled pistolbelonging to Gabriel Archer that he had admired . As Smith walked across the town his most pressing problem was to persuade Archer to part with his pistol , and he was so deep in thought that he almost bumped into a group of adolescents engaged in some sort of athletic contest on the open square before the parade ground . Mentallytired after the long day of negotiation , he paused for a moment to watch them and was surprised to see that Pocahontas was one of the participants . Three English boys were turning cartwheels , and when they finished they challenged her to better their record . Her grace and physical co-ordination impressed the boys , but Smith could have predictedthat she would beat them . What disturbed him was that she was completely absorbed in what she was doing and , unaware of his presence , was behaving with a youthful naturalness he had never before seen in her . He had heretofore thought of her as an adult , and all through yesterday'sbanquet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware of the nearness of an attractive woman . At this moment , however , she looked no older than the adolescents , and for the first time in his life he thought seriously of the gray hairs that were beginning to appear at his temples . Pocahontas , he realized , was at least ten years his junior and she was far more at ease with these boys than she had ever been with him . " I win ! " she shouted jubilantly in English , and Smith was about to walk away , but at that instant she saw him . She straightened her skirt , smoothed her hair , and through some form of necromancy she became a woman again as she came straight to him . " I have hoped to see John Smith , " she said in halting English . " I came to Jamestown only to see you . " Her boldness startled him , but as he gazed at her he saw she was not being unduly forward ; he had consorted with so many hussies in his day that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtly flirtatious attitude . But Pocahontas was neither being coy nor thrusting herself at him . She was telling him the simple truth , and she so disconcertedhim that he did not know what to reply . " Are you happy to see me too ? " she persisted . The boys were watching them , and a film of perspiration appeared on Smith 's forehead . " It is good , " he replied heavily in her own tongue , " to see the daughter of the great Powhatan. "  |p67He  bowed and started off , but to his consternation she waved good-by to the youths and fell in beside him . " When Smith came to the land of the Chickahominy , " she said , speaking her own language too , " Pocahontasshowed him all there was to see in the town of her father . " Smith knew that unless he took her hint and returned the courtesy he would be guilty of a lack of civility that could , if she complained to Powhatan , spoil the trade agreement he had just hammered out . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamestown with a halfnakedgirl as attractive as Pocahontas . There would certainly be gossip , and most of the things said about him would be right . " Tonight , " he said evasively , " there will be a feast for the people of the Chickahominy who have come to Jamestown . The young warriors will march and will make a fire with the noise-sticks that kill our enemies . " He wondered whether to elaborate on the details of the artilleryexhibition he intended to stage , but the language barrier was too great for him to translate his plans into her tongue . " It is the desire of Smith that Pocahontas will be there . I will make a special fire for her , " he added recklessly , hoping the promise would satisfy her . " I will be there , " she said , and smiled brightly . " But it is not yet night . Ek still shines on us . " " So he does . " Smith sighed and thought he had rarely encountered a more stubborn wench . " Have you seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember how eager you were to learn , and there you will find much that will interest you . " " I sat in the room where the young braves and the young squaws learn , " she assured him gravely . " And he who is their chief gave Pocahontas many books in the tongue of the English as a gift . " Smith made a mental note to congratulate the schoolmaster , who had shown unusual perspicacity in presenting her with some textbooks . " There 's the church too , " he said , pointing to it . " I saw it yesterday and spent much time there , " she informed him . " I have read many pages of the Bible Smith gave to me , and it was my wish to see the church first , before I looked at any other building . " She had made up her mind to cling to him , he realized , and the stares of passing townspeople embarrassed him . So , as he could not be rid of her , he decided to make the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far end of the peninsula jutting out into the river was secluded , and the guard normally maintained there had been withdrawn during the visit of the Indians as a gesture of trust in Powhatan , so it was deserted too . He could show her the new cannon therep68and the view , which was the best the town had to offer ; he could also suggest that she look out at the river flowing into the sea , which would be something of a novelty for someone who lived far inland . Perhaps , he thought , that would content her ; however , even if it did not , they would be far less conspicuous out there than they were here in the center of town . He suggested they visit the place , and Pocahontas accepted the invitation with such alacrity that his heart pounded , and he wondered if he was being honest with himself . Surely no one who saw them and guessed their destination would possibly believe his motives were pure in taking such a captivating girl to the most isolated and private spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . They walked silently down the long neck of the peninsula through high grass , and Smith reached for Pocahontas 's hand . She laughed and darted away from him , and he thought for a moment that his initial judgment had been wrong . He had credited her with too little feminine wisdom , but she was being coy and was playing a game with him , just as an English girl would have done . He quickly discovered he was mistaken , however , for she ran to a wild strawberry bush , plucked two large berries , and as she rejoined him she popped one into his mouth without displaying even a trace of self-consciousness . She ate the other and then unhesitatingly slid her hand into his . As they approached the blockhouse several gulls rose into the air , screaming , and circled the building several times before flying away . Pocahontas watched them with grave pleasure , and when Smith lifted the latch and stood aside for her , she paused at the threshold . It was wrong , according to her canons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the customs of the pale-skinned **28;260;TOOLONG were strange , and Smith refused to budge . He bowed with exaggerated deference , and when he grinned at her she walked into the blockhouse , her head high . As she had thought from the first time she had seen him look at her and had read his desire in his eyes , he wanted her as much as she wanted him . Ru-Sa often accused her of being headstrong , of trying to force others to behave as she wished them to act , but there were some things Ru-Sa could not understand . It was not the old woman 's fault , of course , and Pocahontas generously forgave her . After all , many years had passed since Ru-Sa had first been married , and it was unlikely that even then she had felt anything other than a sense of duty to her husband . Like most young squaws , she had probably been given by her father to a war-P69rior she had never known , and it was difficult for any woman to love a stranger . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bound by the restrictions that hampered others . The marriage of her own parentshad been one of real love , and although her mother had died when she was very small , Pocahontas could remember listening to the songs her mother had sung , extolling her wonderful marital relationship . Powhatan was always reluctant to discuss the matter when Pocahontas asked him about it , but that was natural in a man . Nevertheless , she knew how he felt , for twice each year , at the beginning of summer and of winter , he sacrificed a wild boar in memory of the woman who remained first among all the wives he had ever taken . Just as her mother had known from the first moment she had seen Powhatan that she wished to devote the rest of her life to him , so she herself had realized that she loved John Smith . It was fitting that the daughter of a mighty chief should marry no one but a chief , and Pocahontas 's last doubts had vanished when she saw the way the people of Jamestown looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her he was the leader of the pale-skinned tribe only because the people had chosen him for the post and that he would eventually be replaced by another , but the girl dismissed such nonsense as the idle gossip of a stupid old woman . Anyone with eyes could see that Smith commanded the instinctive respect and obedience of every man and woman in his town , and even the boys with whom she had been cavorting this afternoonhad bowed to him as deeply as a young brave made his obeisance to a great chief . Of even greater importance , Smith 's tribe felt very strongly on the subject of love , as Pocahontas knew from what she had been able to decipherin the Book he had given her . Ru-Sa , who obviously enjoyed worrying , chattered endlessly about the differences in the customs of nations and spoke with relish of the Short Men Beyond the Mountains , who called themselves the Sioux . They married only the squaws of their own tribe , and when one of them took an alien woman she was treated as though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Smith 's people , as the God whom they worshiped instructed them to love each other as devoutly as they loved Him . So it was plain that they understood the true meaning of love , and Smith , as their leader , naturally had the greatest knowledge of all , as it was his duty to set an example for the others . It would be strange to live in Jamestown , Pocahontas reflected , andP70the thought that someday she might be required to sail across the water in one of the huge ships whose pictures she had seen frightened her . She was sure she would never learn to like the drab ugly clothes the pale women wore , and the food they cooked was certainly tasteless and flat . But she would feel more at home here when she acquired greater skill in speaking English , and the books she had been given this morning would be a great help to her . What mattered most , however , was that she would be with Smith , and not even Ru-Sa could deny that a wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Smith was saying something to her now as he stood beside a large tube of thick metal , and she forced herself to listen to him . The weird object was obviously a weapon , and she saw that his eyes shone as he described it to her . It would be rude to tell him she was indifferent to weapons , but it pleased her that he was so happy . All men were the same , she thought , and remembered the ecstasy the son of one of her brothers had felt when he was no more than seven summers old and she had given him a little stone ax . It was right and good that Smith took such joy in his weapons , and she impulsively put her hand on his arm . He broke off suddenly and stared at her . " You were n't listening to me , " he said , his tone faintly accusing . " I heard every word , " Pocahontas protested . He knew she was lying and led her away from the cannon to the window that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " he told her , making room for her beside him . They gazed out at the placid blue-green water in silence , and suddenlyPocahontas sighed . Someday he would want to visit the home of his fathers , and she would have no choice but to accompany him . " Is England a large land ? " she asked . " The New World is larger . " He could n't understand the reason for her depression and he felt irritated . He had gone to considerable effort to entertain her , but the visit to the blockhouse was turning out to be a dismal failure . The cannon had bored her , and now the sight of the broad river made her disconsolate . She stirred , and he realized they were standing close together ; their shoulders touched , and her proximity aroused him . " The view , " he said abruptly , " is best from the watchtower platform . " He started off toward a flight of steps , and Pocahontas , following him , knew she had displeased him . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively that she should react more strongly to whatever he showed her . He led her through a room in which there were four beds ofp71the kind the pale-faced people used , and when he explained to her that the guards slept here when they were not on sentry duty , she smiled at him steadily . He responded at once , and when she saw desire flare up in his eyes again , she realized that her conduct was now more appropriate . Smith opened a narrow wooden door and took her onto what appeared to be a narrow shelf of logs built out past the edge of the building . The platform reminded her of the Chickahominy burial tables , and she giggled nervously ; Ek was low in the sky , but he could still see her , and he would certainly be angered by the presence of a living person on a platform of the dead . However , she was no longer sure that Ek had any real power over her . The Book Smith had given her said much about his God that made sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps , after she and Smith were married , he would consent to discuss the subject with her . She hoped he would , for his position as chief of his people obviously made him their leading medicineman as well , so she could go to no higher authority for an explanationof the problems that perplexed her . " You can see two or three miles in every direction from here , " he told her . " From the first moment I saw this little hill I knew it was the most logical spot for a blockhouse . " Pocahontas could see only trees and water , neither of which had any particular significance to her . Had she wanted to look at trees , she could have stayed at home and gazed at them all day from the door of her own house on the hill of the Chief of Chiefs . What did intrigue her , however , was the notion of looking down from the platform to the ground ; the idea had not occurred to her for a long time , but as a child she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their burial tables . Smiling apprehensively , she inched closer to the end of the platform and glanced down . A wave of dizziness swept over her , and she was afraid she was going to fall . The thought flashed through her mind that Ek was indeed angry and was punishing her . Gasping , she tried to draw back but could not , and she tried to grasp something on which to steady herself , but her fingers clutched only air . Then suddenly John Smith came up behind her , his strong hands encircled her waist , and he drew her back to safety . The girl turned to thank him , and his hold on her tightened . Then , before she quite realized what was happening , he kissed her . Never had Pocahontas known such rapture , never had her blood raced so violently , and she clung to him , reveling in his masculine solidity . After what seemed like an eternity he released her , and they stood for a long mo/ment , speechless and out of breath , their eyes meeting . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do . She moved past Smith and walked with simple , demure dignity back into the bedroom . He followed her , and as he looked at her she slowly removed her breastband and skirt . Seeing the indescribable exultation in his face , she knew that she was right . They loved each other and they belonged together . But in spite of her certainty that what she was doing was both right and natural , she had to curb a desire to run away as he approached her , his arms outstretched . At the very least she wanted to snatch up her clothes again and cover her body , and it astonished her that she who had never in her life been ashamed to let others see her body was almost overcome by a sense of shyness . She was being weak , she told herself sternly ; Ru-Sa had taught her everything there was to know about the intimacies of men and women , and if she failed to meet her test with courage , she would be disgraced , just as the warrior who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , as Smith caught her in his arms again , her diffidence vanished miraculously , and a feeling unlike any she had ever before known suffusedher . Until this moment she had been proud and independent , reliant only on herself , needing and wanting no one else to make her whole . Yet her instinct told her that by the act of surrender to Smith that she was performing voluntarily she would give up her independence for all time , that from this day forward she would need his love to be fulfilled . Scarcely conscious of what she was doing , she struggled against him , beating her fists ineffectually against his chest as he embraced her . She wanted him to release her , but at the same time she was demanding that he conquer her , and she rejoiced when he kissed her , ignoring her protests . He caressed her , and she trembled when she realized that alien hands were stroking her , that a will stronger than her own was dominatingher . Suddenly she no longer cared ; the man to whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she loved above all others and who loved her in return . Her ecstasy matched his ardor , and as her passion soared , her last articulate thought was that she was learning the final lesson , one that neither Ru-Sa nor anyone else could have taught her : by surrendering herself to Smith , without reservation , she was binding him to her for the rest of their lives . He would always be a part of her , just as she would always belong to him , and nothingP73could ever break the bonds that were being forged in this instant of complete harmony and satisfaction . Night was falling , and the clouds that raced toward the east cast deep purple shadows across a lavender sky when Pocahontas and Smith left the blockhouse . He turned to close the door , and in the brief moment that his attention was diverted she left his side and ran down to the water 's edge . Something in her attitude , perhaps the set of her shoulders or the way she held her head , told him she wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Satiated and at peace , he waited for her patiently and let the cool breeze from the west play on him as he glanced idly at the dim silhouettes of the Jamestown houses , now almost invisible in the thickening twilight . Pocahontas stared with unseeing eyes at the swiftly flowing water and tried to think coherently . This was the most important day in her life , yet to her surprise she was essentially the same person she had been an hour ago . Nevertheless , she knew she was not what she had been and she realized that her future was that of a woman , not a girl . Smith was all that she had imagined , and she was convinced that their love was indestructible . She was able to smile at herself , too , and felt a twinge of nostalgia for the naive ignorance that had characterized her views of the relationship between a man and a woman . Yet at the same time she gloried in her new-found knowledge ; her heart was full because reality far exceeded her wildest dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although she tried to dismiss it , she could not . It bothered her that Smith had not yet followed the inviolable Chickahominy custom of tapping her three times on the left shoulder and informing her that she would now become his wife . But , she told herself , it was probable that his people followed a different practice , and she knew that it was her place as a woman to say nothing and to wait meekly until he chose to announce their forthcoming marriage . As Ru-Sa was so fond of saying , every nation followed its own habits . A slight tremor shook Pocahontas . Then she straightened , reached up , and removed her maiden 's headband . It had been a part of her as far back as she could remember , but she felt no regrets as she gazed for a moment at the smooth white seeds . Then she threw the strip of leather into the river and stood motionless , watching it until it became waterloggedand sank . Later that night the blockhouse was the scene of considerable activitywhen the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration of artillery fire . The Indians were duly impressed by the show , as Smith had been certain they would be ; he had chosen the time for the display with great care , for he had reasonedthat the accuracy of his gunners ' marksmanship would mean less to the Naturals than the sight of the flames leaping from the muzzles of the cannon and the roar of thunder that accompanied each shot . Afterward the entire party repaired to the meeting hall in the center of the town for a banquet which became a celebration when Powhatan and Smith revealed the terms of the agreement they had made . Over a meal consisting of successive courses of barbecued venison , buffalo steak , bear stew , and roasted wild boar , the Englishmen and the natives forgot their reserve , and by midnight they were drinking toasts to each other in ale , sack , and an inferior grade of Spanish brandy . As a number of the ladies of Jamestown were present at the supper , Powhatan 's wives and daughter were permitted to attend , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence at a table in a far corner . The Chief of Chiefs , who had been more deeply affected by the artillery demonstration than he was willing to admit , paid no attention to his women during the earlier hours of the meal . He believed he had struck an excellent bargain and he was relaxing for the first time since he had arrived in the town of the foreigners . But as the night wore on he became increasingly aware of Pocahontas ; the first thing he noticed was that she was radiant , and not even her natural feminine modesty could hide her buoyancy . Then he realized that she never took her eyes from John Smith , and even someone who was unfamiliarwith her moods could see that she was gazing at him with frank adoration . Something was unusual about her appearance , too , and Powhatan was puzzled until , with a sense of shock , it dawned on him that she was no longer wearing her headband . For a moment he was numb , then he turned abruptly to Smith , who sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him staring at Pocahontas , apparently knew what was in his mind and , shifting in his seat , began to engage in a busy conversation with someone farther down the table . Powhatan 's fingers closed over the silver fork his hosts had given him as a token of esteem , and he bent the strip of metal until it snapped . He had been wrong to listen to Pocahontas 's pleas and bring her on this journey , but what was done , was done . He knew without being told what was in Smith 's mind and he realized this was not the occasion to make a scene . There were some hundreds of the pale-skinned warriorsp75in the town , and his own braves were badly outnumbered . Besides , he had no desire to wage an immediate war against men who owned such potent fire-sticks . On the other hand , under no circumstances would he permit his only daughter to be sent to the lodge of the Women Without Virtue , and he decided to bide his time . He waited until the meal ended , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guileless smile . " When the food of the Chickahominy has been exchanged for the weapons of the **25;290;TOOLONG , we will be brothers , " he said . " We will be brothers , " Smith agreed warily . He had taken a calculatedrisk when he had made love to Pocahontas , and her father unquestionablyrealized what had happened , but the captain was counting on his quick wits to save him from any embarrassing consequences . " When we are brothers , " the Chief of Chiefs continued , " the land of the Chickahominy will become the land of Smith , King of James . " He spread out his hands and addressed his own followers : " Hear the words of Powhatan , my children . From this time forth , until Ek shines no more , it is the right of Smith to go where he pleases in the lands of the Chickahominy , the Potomac , the Chesapeake and the Manahoac , the Monacan and the Chawon . " A sensation of relief flooded over Smith ; he had been certain that Powhatanwas going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a clever student of human nature occasionally made a wrong estimate . Luckily the Chief of Chiefs ' attitude was that of a truly civilized sophisticate rather than a savage : it was evident he did not blame a man for forming a temporary liaison with a girl who was as handsome a baggageas Pocahontas . Dismissing her from his mind with little effort , Smith looked forward with eager anticipation to his future travels . His explorations would bring him even greater renown than his administration of the affairs of Jamestown , he believed , and Powhatan , by granting him the right to go where he pleased in the Chickahominy domain , was virtually guaranteeing him a high permanent place in the annals of the new century 's great men . The visit of the Indians to Jamestown certainly had been an unqualified success from every possible point of view . The visitors departed early the following morning , and the whole colony gathered to see them off . The atmosphere was relaxed and congenial , the Chickahominy elders and the gentlemen of the Council renewed their protestations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held on the banks of the James River . Several kegsP76of ale were tapped , and everyone enjoyed a final drink . The settlers serenaded their guests with a song that had been popular in England shortly before they had left for the New World , and the Indians responded with a merry , rhythmic chant . Only one person in the assemblage seemed to be subdued , but she concealed her true feelings so successfully that no one but her father even guessed that she was unhappy . Pocahontas stood quietly on the grassy slope near the canoe in which she was to ride , her arms folded beneath an ankle-length buffalo cloak . She made herself so inconspicuousthat few of the revelers were aware of her presence , and Captain Smith , who had been making it his business to say a few pleasant words to each of the Indians , was startled when he came face to face with her . He had been so busy he had almost forgotten her . " I wish you a safe journey , " he said , lifting his mug of ale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Pocahontas 's voice was steady , but her hands , hidden beneath her cloak , were not , and her fingernails cut deep into the flesh of her arms . It would be so easy to fool herself , to pretend that the smile he bestowed on her had a special , intimate significance , but she realized she would gain nothing by self-deception . However , there were limits to her courage ; although she could not deny that he was preoccupied at the moment , she would not let herself believe that his love-making had been casual and that she had meant nothing to him . " We will meet again , " he said , and bowed politely . " We will , John Smith . " Watching him move off , she told herself that her fears had been groundless . He would come to her when he could , and then they would be married . It was good that the wedding would take place in her own land , for all the people of the Chickahominy would gather for the ceremony and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been watching the brief exchange , smiled faintly , and his wives glanced at each other in alarm . They knew that smile , and they hoped desperately that they had done nothing to anger him . Shivering beneath their long cloaks , they knew there was grave trouble ahead for someone . P77Supplies of Chickahominy foodstuffs began to arrive at Jamestown within two weeks of Powhatan 's return home , and Captain Smith loaded culverins and muskets and gunpowder onto the Indian barges that had carried the grain and meat . The colony 's immediate prosperityand security were thus assured , and Smith , bored by the petty details of routine administration , left the settlement at the first possible opportunity . Accompanied by ten adventurous companions , whom he had selected carefully from the ranks of many volunteers , he started to explore the territory around Chesapeake Bay . The Council was disturbed by his absence , and Gabriel Archer expressed the view of the majority when he said it was the duty of the president to govern Jamestown in person . But Smith , enthusiastically mapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the complaints that came to him through the messengers who occasionally brought him news . He spent the better part of the summer probing into every far corner of the bay , and when he returned to Jamestown he had accumulated so much data that for the first time he was in a position to think seriously about the book he had long wanted to write . He prepared two letters to London printers , explaining the project he had in mind , and then , as August was unusually dry and cool , he decided to take advantage of the weather and investigate the country in the vicinity of the Potomac River . The Council protested , which did not surprise him , but he continued to command the loyal support of the people and he felt no concern when Captain Archer threatened to have him removed from office unless he devoted himself solely to his duties . The new expedition ran into difficulties at the outset , and two of theP78men who had planned to accompany Smith were left behind when they fell ill shortly before the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the group was severely stung by hornets and had to be sent home , and later that same day still another tripped over an exposed oak root and sprained his ankle . He could not walk withoutassistance , and it was necessary for two of his companions to take him back to the colony . The party was thus reduced to five , and the men began to mutter to each other about bad luck , but Smith 's buoyancy was unaffected by the misfortunes , and he remained confident and energetic . On the third day of the journey through the wilderness , when it was too late for any one person to turn back alone , the youngest of the explorers , a seventeen-year-old Londoner named Curtis Watkins , thoroughlyfrightened himself and the others by claiming they were being followed . Smith tried to calm him , but Watkins stubbornly continued to insist that someone was watching them from behind the omnipresent trees . The others soon succumbed to the same hysteria in spite of their leader 's insistence that they were the victims of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby in the forests , keeping them under observation . By the next morning Smith was forced to agree that they were right ; he had tried to tell himself that he had allowed the fears of the men to influence him , yet he began to suffer the same uncanny feeling that someone was spying on them . He tried to reassure his companions by saying that any natives who might mean them harm would attack them rather than let them continue to wander where they pleased , but his logic failed to allay their uneasiness , and he himself found it increasingly difficult to concentrate on his sketches of the terrain . The tension became so great by midafternoon that he finally called a halt beside a small brook , and rather than push on any farther he proposed that they remain in this pleasant spot for the night and spend the rest of the afternoon hunting . They had caught occasional glimpses of deer and smaller animalsthroughout the day , and as the region seemed to abound in game , Smith felt that a few hours of relaxation would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went off in pairs , agreeingto return to the brook before sundown . Smith , who had no interest in hunting other than as a means of acquiring food , sat down beside the stream and began to work on his notes . Any savages who might be watching the party were obviously curious rather than hostile , he told himself firmly , and it was far more important to make the usual full entriesin his journal than to worry about them . Indians , he reminded him-P79self , were primitive people and hence were virtually without guile ; they saw others either as enemies or friends , and were totally unfamiliar with the subtleties that shaded the judgments more civilized men formed in their relations with each other . He soon became absorbed in his writing and he smiled absently when a crash of musket fire broke the silence of the forest . One of his companionswas enjoying good fortune . But the smile froze on his lips when a scream of terror seemed to make the leaves on the trees tremble and , jumping to his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction from which the sound had come . The wilderness was quiet again , and after running through the thick underbrush for several minutes he was uncertain whether he was on the right track . Twice he paused and shouted , but there was no answer , and he had no choice but to plunge on . After racing aimlessly for a quarter of an hour , he heard voices in the distance off to the left ; as nearly as he could judge by the angry tones , an argument of some sort seemed to be in progress , and he increased his pace . The voices became louder , and at last he came into the open at the base of a small , rocky hill that was almost bare of vegetation . Halting abruptly and trying to catch his breath , he could only stare at the sight that confronted him . At least twenty Indian warriors were gathered in the clearing , and with them were his four companions . Each of the settlerswas surrounded by several braves , and Curtis Watkins in particular seemed to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two warriorsheld his arms , and a third was angrily waving a long bone-handled knife in front of his face . Smith overcame his feeling of shock , and as he stepped forward , his pistol pointed at the knife-wielding savage , it occurred to him that these Indians were tall , light-skinned , and wore the feathered headdresses of the Chickahominy . Something strange was taking place , for this was the land of the Potomac , who were a shorter , darker tribe , and it was unusual for so large a group of braves to journey into the territory of another nationeven when they enjoyed friendly relations . However , this was not the time to dwell on such matters , and he cocked his pistol . " Smith , King of James , greets his brothers , " he said quickly in the tongue of the Chickahominy . " Why have you made captives of my men ? " Several of the warriors began to edge around behind him , but he hastily pointed his pistol at each of them in turn , and they halted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brave with the knife answeredP80him . " This land is a hunting ground of the Chickahominy , " he said gravely . " The Chickahominy warriors , like their fathers before them , hunt for food in these forests . But no others may hunt here . " The man was lying ; this was unquestionably the territory of the Potomac , and if it was indeed a hunting preserve , it belonged to them rather than to their neighboring overlords . It occurred to Smith that this was no ordinary misunderstanding , and in all probability it was the Chickahominywho had been following his party for the past day and a half . If his surmise was correct , then the Indians had merely been waiting for some flimsy excuse to capture him and his friends . Yet , even though he felt that he had uncovered the truth , he could imagine no reason why Powhatan should want to harm him . The trade pact they had made was mutually satisfactory as well as eminently fair , and it was obvious that both sides would benefit . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bold course of action might prove disastrous , and he planted his feet wide apart . Although puzzled , he could not afford the luxury of analyzing the matter when his companions were in danger . " I demand that you release my men , " he said loudly . The Chickahominy warriors did not move . " Smith is the brother of Powhatan , the Chief of Chiefs , and in his name I order you to release my men ! " Several of the braves glanced at each other a trifle uncertainly , but their leader was unimpressed . " This young warrior , " he said , " killed a doe in the hunting ground of my people . He who steals food from the Chickahominy must die . " Again he raised his blade to the face of the terrified Watkins . " You wear seven feathers , so you should be wise , but you have offendedEk , and he has taken your wits from you . " Smith contrived to laugh deprecatingly , and no actor at the Globe or Blackfriars had ever sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Smith , he granted to Smith the right to travel where he pleases . I call on all who heard the words of the Chief of Chiefs to say whether I speak the truth . " His eyes , hard and angry , searched the faces of the warriors , and two or three of them , men who had apparently been members of the group that had visited Jamestown , nodded . He was about to press his advantage , but the leader of the Chickahominy cut him off . " Only the sons of Ek may use this hunting ground , " he repeated stubbornly , and before anyonecould intervene he plunged his knife deep into the throat of Curtis Watkins.  |p81The  young Londoner died instantly , and Smith reacted promptly . Taking careful aim , he put a bullet into the killer , and the w.rrior slumped to the ground . It was some small satisfaction to know that a murder had been avenged , but Smith had no chance to dwell on the matter . Before he could draw his sword , four husky braves pounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate hand-to-hand fight . His three surviving companions , themselves surrounded , were unable to come to his aid , so he had to battle against his assailants alone . He fought ferociously , with a savage abandon even deadlier than that of his Indian foes , and he more than held his own against them . They threw him to the ground , and while one of them grappled with him the others tried to pin down his arms and legs , but he was so strong and quick that they could not hold him . He saw a shaved head only a few inches from his own and , grasping his pistol by the barrel like a club , he brought the butt down on the Chickahominy 's head . He laughed harshly when his victim screamed and fell away from him , but at that instant one of the others wrenched the pistol from him , and he was forced to fight with his bare hands . Again and again he smashed his fists into the painted faces and bodies of his attackers , and with each blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his life , when he had been set upon by bandits near Damascus , had he engaged in a contest with so many opponents at one time , and he realized vaguely that although his life was in jeopardy he was enjoying himself . The warriors pummeled him in return , but fist fighting was apparently unknown to Indians , and the damage they inflicted on him was negligible . They preferred to wrestle with him when they could , and at one point a tall , wiry brave wrapped his legs around Smith 's middle and systematicallybegan to squeeze the breath out of him . The pain was excruciating , and only by calling on his last reserves of vitality was the Englishman able to break his foe 's hold . From that moment forward he tried to hold the savages at bay and not let them come close enough to tackle or clutch him again . Obviously they knew far more than he about wrestling , and at odds of three to one he would soon be overwhelmed if their technique prevailed . He knew that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his tactics they would gradually wear him down , but whenever he regained his feet they rushed him , and he had no choice but to remain on the defensive as he attempted to ward them off . Occasionally he caught glimpses of his companions , whose handsP82had been securely tied with long strips of rawhide and who were being guarded by the other members of the party . These braves , peculiarly , made no effort to join in the fight but stood watching the fray calmly and unconcernedly ; in their minds , at least , there seemed to be no doubt as to the outcome of the struggle . Smith realized that if he could draw his sword he would be in a far better position not only to defend himself but to launch a real counterattack . However , his assailants gave him no opportunity to free his right hand for even an instant , and they crowded him so doggedly that he had to keep punching at them while retreating constantly . Two or three times he thought he would break into the clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had twisted around behind him , one or another of the warriors would come at him again . It was odd , he thought dimly , that none of them had drawn knives , and although all carried tomahawks in the belted middles of their loincloths , they too continued to fight without drawing their weapons . He wondered if they were merely playing with him , after the manner of animals teasing a weaker prey , but it finally dawned on him that they were not . Curtis Watkins was dead , but he had been unimportant to them , and from the way the braves launched each fresh attack Smith could only conclude that they were under orders to capture him rather than kill him . Mystified , but more determined than ever , he managed at last to wrench free of his antagonists ; withdrawing a few steps , he jerked at his sword belt and brought it back into proper position . He shouted in hoarse triumph as his fingers closed over the solid iron hilt of his blade , and when the warriors rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of the steel they hesitated and , cursing them fluently in English and Arabic , he started toward them . The lust of battle was in his eyes now and , looking at him , they knew they would be lucky to survive . They backed away from him , slowly at first , and then one of them took to his heels . Smith , certain now that he would win , wanted to taunt the Chickahominyfor cowardice but decided it was wiser to save his breath . Balancing on the balls of his feet , he narrowed the gap between him and the tallest of his opponents , ready to lunge as soon as he was within striking distance . In his new-found exultation , however , he momentarily forgot the Indian spectators , whose attitude changed from one of complacency to active concern when they saw that he was armed and prepared to shed the blood of their brothers , He was aware that theyp83were stirring , and in his present reckless mood he was ready to take on all of them , but they gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the others , approached him from the rear so silently that Smith did not hear him . The warrior carried a small tomahawk in his hand , and when he was no more than ten feet from his victim he threw it with consummate skill . The blunt end of the weapon 's head rather than the sharp edge crashed against the base of Smith 's head , thus stunning him rather than killing him . He knew he was losing consciousness , but even as he fell he continued to fight , stabbingblindly into space with his sword as he pitched headlong onto the rocky ground . The warriors , afraid he might be conscious , approached him gingerly , and only when they were certain he was harmless did they roll him over and remove the blade from his tightly closed fingers . They showed no elation over their victory , and with no display of emotion they tied his hands and feet firmly with strips of rawhide . Then they buried their dead companion without ceremony and , after quickly scalping Curtis Watkins , left his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after the branches had been cut off , the pole was quickly strung through the loops made by Smith 's bound hands and feet . The sapling was hoisted onto the shoulders of four braves , and CaptainJohn Smith , gentleman , president of the Jamestown Council and Honorable Envoy of the London Company , author , cartographer , and explorer , dangled from the crude sling like the carcass of a deer . A new leader , the warrior who had ended the fight with his tomahawk , gave a signal , and the Chickahominy , driving their other captives before them , started off toward the southwest through the still , calm forest . When Smith regained consciousness his agony was so intense that for a moment he thought he was in his own bed , experiencing a nightmare . His arms felt as though they were being torn from their sockets , a deep ache penetrated to the marrow of his thigh bones , and he thought his wrists and ankles were on fire . He cried out , but no one seemed to hear him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the Indians were carrying him , his anger and humiliation made him forget his pain for an instant . Calling to them in their own language , he demanded that they put him down , but they ignored his protests and continued their silent march through the wilderness , impervious to his objections and callous to his suffering . They did not halt until long after night had fallen , and only then , when they halted for a few hours ' rest , did they cut Smith down andP84give him a little pulse and raw fish to eat . When they resumed their journey shortly before dawn they started to truss him again , but he objectedwith such bitter vehemence that they held a brief consultation and thereafter permitted him to walk on his own feet . But they took no chances that he might escape , and their elaborate precautions were an ironic testimony to the respect they felt for him . Two warriors hovered close behind him , others kept watch on either side of him , his hands were kept tied behind his back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his neck and was used to keep him in check , as though he were a mastiff on a leash . The savages were tireless and maintained a pace throughout the day that exhausted their prisoners . Smith had always been proud of his stamina , but by dusk he thought each step would be his last , and he envied the ability of his captors to continue without pausing for either food or relaxation . The countryside began to look vaguely familiar to him now , and although it was not easy to distinguish one section of the wilderness from another in the dark , he became convinced that this was an area he had once sketched . A three-quarter moon rose slowly in the sky , and by its light Smith caught a glimpse of a broad ribbon of silver through the trees to his left . He recognized it as the James River and he forgot his fatigue as he quickly oriented himself . They were no more than a mile or two from the Chickahominy capital now , and he shouted an encouraging word to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck was promptly tightened as a warning , so he made no attempt to speak again . The present ordeal would end soon , and although he had no idea of what might be ahead , he was filled with a determination to survive no matter what the cost . He was completely at a loss to understand why natives who were presumably his friends had turned on him , but in spite of the fact that the long march had numbed his mind , he knew himself to be more intelligent , more cunning , and more astute than his captors . In one way or another he would overcome his difficulties , which would make absorbing reading for thousands of his fellow countrymen when he eventually reduced the record of his experiences to writing . The thought that his present dilemma would increase his future stature at home was comforting , and he held his head high as the warriors led him onto a waiting raft , ferried him and his men across the river to their town , and then , separating him from the others , conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The building was surrounded by braves armed with knives , and stand/ing in front of the entrance was a tall man holding one of the muskets that Smith had sent to the tribe earlier in the summer . The feathered headdress of the warrior was ornate , and when Smith came closer to the hut he saw that the man was Powhatan 's eldest son , Opachisco , with whom he had shared several meals on his first visit here . But the eyes of the future ruler of the Chickahominy Confederation were cold and brooding now , and he stared through the captive without seeing him . It seemed that Opachisco was going to extraordinary lengths to indicate that he did not recognize the prisoner , and this simple incident was far more alarming than the abusive treatment Smith had received at the hands of the braves who had brought him here . Opachisco , unlike his inferiors , knew better , and his deliberate hostility was menacing . Smith 's bonds were cut , he was shoved into the hut , and two guards immediately appeared in the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their stares , he sprawled on the hard earth , grateful for the chance to rest . He tried to maintain his courage , but the tiny room was bare , and the walls were as bleak as his expectations for the immediate future . The braves stepped aside to allow an elderly squaw to enter , and she glared venomously at Smith as she gave him a handful of parched corn and a small wooden bowl of sinewy dried beef . He had no appetite , and the food was tasteless , but he forced himself to eat , for he reminded himself that he would be even more at the mercy of the savages if he lost his strength . Then a sense of lethargy came over him , and when he finished the cheerless meal he stretched out on the ground and dropped off to sleep . In the morning he was given more corn and tough meat and he made several fruitless attempts to learn more of his situation by conversing casually with the guards . He joked with them , he cajoled and he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at last he fell silent too . Obviously they were under orders not to talk to him , regardless of the provocation . He tried to reassure himself that his plight was the result of a misunderstanding , but as the morning wore on he became increasingly tense , and by noon he was so upset that he could keep a grip on himself only with an effort . Twice Opachisco came to look at him but said nothing ; no words were necessary , unfortunately , and in the bright daylight Smith could see the frank contempt in the other 's eyes . Shortly after noon there was a stir outside the hut , and a long shadow appeared in the open entrance . Smith glanced up , then jumped to his feet when he saw Powhatan , his arms folded beneath his robe , thep86feathers on his headband brushing the low ceiling . " Powhatan greets his brother , " the Chickahominy said urbanely . Smith hooked his thumbs in his belt , and for a moment his rage made him inarticulate . " Brother , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect and decency , not like criminals ! " There was no change in the Chief of Chiefs ' expression . " Powhatan bids his brother welcome to the land of the Chickahominy , " he declared imperturbably . After all that had happened , even the most composed of men would have been angry , and patience had never been one of Smith 's virtues . " Why am I being held here ? What has happened to my men , and why have we been treated as though we had committed some terrible wrong ? " Powhatan 's eyes became cloudy , and a muscle twitched in his left cheek . " A great wrong has been done , " he said , sounding so pontifical that Smith was reminded of Sir Edward Coke , England 's pompous Lord Chief Justice . " Tell me what we 've done ! " It would probably be wiser to show humility , the prisoner realized , but he could not help hurling a challenge at this complacent savage . " First , " the Chief of Chiefs replied slowly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chickahominy killed a doe there . " The charge was so outrageously absurd that Smith stared at him . " You gave me the right to go where I please in all of your lands ! Many of your people and many of mine heard you grant me that right ! " " The right was given to Smith , it is true . But it was not given to others . Yet four others were with Smith . " Powhatan spoke reasonably , as though his logic could not be refuted . " Yes , and one of my followers was murdered in cold blood . " Smith had recovered his equilibrium , and his accent was clipped . Powhatan shrugged , indicating clearly that he was not concerned over so trivial a matter as the death of one of the pale-skinned foreigners . " It was he who killed an animal in the hunting ground of the Chickahominy . It was he who first broke the law of my Confederation which forbidsany to use hunting grounds that belong to others . So it was right that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Smith was anxious to get to the core of the matter . " That is n't why he was murdered , and you know it . We were n't trespassing on Chickahominy hunting preserves , and I 'm not even certain the area was actually a hunting ground . Wep87were n't on your territory at all . It so happens we were in the land of the Potomac , and I can prove it . " The Chief of Chiefs ignored the interruption . " One of the mightiest of Chickahominy warriors was killed after he punished the stranger who broke the law . Matatulawan was a good man . The gods loved him , for he never failed in his duty to them . " Apparently the life of a bloodthirsty Indian was more important than that of a young Englishman whose whole life had been before him , and Smith struggled to stifle a furious retort . Powhatan , as he well knew , was neither stupid nor ingenuous and surely realized that the position he was taking was inconsistent . " My follower loved his God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . His God loved him . " He smiled sardonically and peered at the Natural to see how he would react to this bald refutation of his argument . Powhatan chose to be momentarily deaf ; he had been leading up to a point and he refused to be diverted . Removing his hands from beneath his buffalo robe , he pointed a thick forefinger at his prisoner . " He who kills a warrior of the Chickahominy without cause must die . " " Without cause ? " Smith asked incredulously . he recognized the fact that his reply was feeble , but the whole discussion was so warped and demented that he did not know what else to say . " Smith has killed a warrior of the Chickahominy , so Smith must die . " The older man 's voice was stern , and his face was set in uncompromising lines . There was a silence , and then Smith smiled . He could not and would not believe he had truly been condemned to death because he had avenged a follower who had been murdered without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men would have done the same , and he felt certain there was something vitally significant that Powhatan had left unsaid . Smith could not let himself forget that his position at the moment was vulnerable , but he remembered that in their trade negotiations the Indian had always approached the heart of his demands by indirect means . Negotiations of some sort were plainly in progress now , and although Smith did not yet know what the Chickahominy wanted of him , he was afraid he would be required to pay a severe penalty if he refused to play the game . " Have me put to death if it will give you any satisfaction , " he said lightly . " But you know as well as I do that if you kill me there will be war between my people and your people . And my people have noisesticksfar more powerful than those I gave to you . " P88Powhatan 's forefinger did not waver . " The gods weep for Matatulawan . They will not be happy again until the murderer loses his blood and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods , has spoken . " Smith saw that the Indian was serious . " You seem to give me no choice , " he said simply . " There is a choice . " The Englishman averted his eyes and spoke very softly , very casually . " Oh ? " " The spirits of the gods live not only in Powhatan , but in his children . Like him , they have the right to kill those who break the law . They sit in judgment on the people of the Chickahominy , for the gods dwell in them and give them the power to separate the guilty from the innocent . When one of my family puts the guilty to death , he acts for the gods . Ek will not punish one who acts in his place and who has the right to speak for him . Ris will not punish one in whom he dwells , nor will any of the other gods who live in the skies or in the earth or in the flowing waters . " Smith nodded almost imperceptibly . Stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was remarkably like that of England . King James believed he ruled by divine right , and anyone he or his relatives disliked was beheaded . Of course it was necessary to observe certain legal formalities before an Englishman could be executed , and in a sense the technique of the American natives was better , for they eliminated all hypocritical and time-consuming ceremony . But the principle was the same . Powhatan took a single step closer , and his voice became a trifle milder . " Smith , " he said , " may become a member of the family of Powhatan . That is his choice . " The inference was staggering . " The daughter of Powhatan , " the Chief of Chiefs continued , " is the squaw of no man . But she will become the wife of Smith if he holds out his hand to her . Then he will be the son of Powhatan . The gods will then know that the death of Matatulawan was right and just . " All that had happened since the moment Smith had known he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and Powhatan 's carefully planned , sly trickery was breath-taking . Smith was outraged , but he discovered that his resentment was directed at Pocahontas rather than at her father . She had thrown herself at him repeatedly , until in a moment of weakness he had taken her , and now she was demanding that he pay an impossible price . He damned herP89silently and recalled Sir Walter Raleigh 's comment about women . Pocahontas , in spite of her air of innocence , was a true daughter of Eve . " She who would become the squaw of Smith is not a maiden , " the Chief of Chiefs said quietly . " She wears the white headband of a maiden , for I have forbidden her to appear without it . The daughter of Powhatan must not be shamed before the people of the Chickahominy . But if Smith does not hold out his hand to her , then she must go to the lodge of the Women Without Virtue . " For the first time he lost his composure , and his voice trembled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live a lie . And if Smith does not marry her he will surely die this day . " Smith wanted to shout that under no circumstances could he be induced to take a savage wife back to England with him . If he appeared there with Pocahontas at his side he would become the laughingstock of London , and one of the most brilliant careers of the century would be irrevocably ruined . Pocahontas had tricked him with a cunning that left him almost no room in which to maneuver , but he could not believe that she or her father would make good their preposterous bluff and , setting his jaw stubbornly , he shook his head . Powhatan , who had been watching him closely , sighed and then straightened . The muscle in his face twitched again as he once more folded his arms beneath his robe . " Smith will not give his answer now , " he said . " He will speak later in the presence of Ek and of all the people of the Chickahominy . " Turning with slow dignity , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a drum summoned every member of the community to a large clearing beyond the last of the city 's seven hills . Here , according to legend , a flaming rock had fallen and had buried the greater part of itself in the earth in the days of the father of Powhatan 's grandfather . Since that time the Chickahominy had been successful in all their endeavors , and as everyone from the wisest elders to the youngest children knew , the rock was a gift from the gods and a symbol of their favor . No trees or shrubs or grass would grow in the sacred clearing , and twelve warriors , men especially selected for their courage and honesty , alternated in standing guard at the base of that portion of the rock which jutted above the ground . Only the most importantceremonies were held here , and no one but the ruler of the whole Confederation was ever permitted to mount to the flat top of the rock itself . The drum continued to beat after the tribe had been assembled , and even the children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marched slowly down from his own lodge and took his place at the crest of the stone . Pocahontas , who was following her brothers , had no idea why the call had been issued and she did not care . She realized vaguely that , when she had been bidden to join the rest of the family , Opachisco and Dalan had both stared at her meaningfully , but she preferrednot to speculate on the reason they had looked at her . It was probable , she thought dully , that they knew she had no real right to wear the headband of white seeds that sat so heavily on her brow , but she no longer cared . Soon all the people of the Chickahominy would know , and then her disgrace would be complete . But what mattered most to her was that she herself was constantly aware of her mortification , and she often told herself that the God of the Christians , like the gods of her ancestors , knew she was living a falsehood . The warriors looked at her with shining eyes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their envy , but she no longer took pride in her appearance . Ever since the day she had faced reality and had forced herself to acknowledge the fact that John Smith would never come to claim her as his wife she had been indifferent to the opinions of others . She had remained in her house for long hours at a time , either reading the books the English schoolmaster in Jamestown had given her or else grieving for a love that would never again be given to her . She no longer played at games with the other young people , and she ate so little food that Ru-Sa , genuinely worried about her , no longer scolded her . She had lost weight , her step was listless , and the bright smile that had once made her the favorite of the nation was missing . She would have been surprised to learn that the people thought her as attractive as ever , but even if she had known , she would have been indifferent to their opinion . She was barefooted , and the earth was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minded minor discomforts , and when her father had seated himself on the top of the rock she moved unthinkingly to her usual position beside Dalan at the base of the stone . She was startled when Powhatan beckoned to her , and she climbed the rock to him , her heart pounding . It occurred to her that he was going to make a public announcement of her shame here and now , and she called herself a coward because she was relieved when she saw that he was smiling at her and that his eyes were compassionate . He motioned her to a seat on the slope at his feet , and his hand on her shoulder was so gentle that she knew she would not be exposed today . She saw that everyone was watching her and she roused herself sufficiently to smooth her hair , which hung loose down her back , and toP91tighten the buckskin thongs of orange , blue , and green that were tied around her waist . Then she modestly tugged at the hem of her kneelengthtunic of cream-colored deerskin and wished she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such clothes were worn only by young girls , not by women , and with the whole tribe looking at her and wondering why her father was paying her such a high honor , her feeling of self-debasement became more intense . Had Powhatan 's hand not remainedon her shoulder she would have wept , but she reminded herself that until such time as she was sent to join the other Women Without Virtue it was her duty to behave in public with the dignity befitting the daughter of a mighty chief . Opachisco seemed to be in charge of the event , and when he gave a signal a number of slaves appeared and drove four stakes into the ground at the four corners of the sacred clearing . The pole which was closest to the rock on which Pocahontas sat with her father was thicker and taller than the others , and she glanced up at Powhatan inquiringly . He patted her bare shoulder soothingly , but the remote smile that appeared on his lips was grim and self-satisfied , and she felt a sudden , inexplicable tremor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took two steps out into the clearing from his place at the foot of the rock . Strangers , he told the people , had violated the law that prohibited outsiders from using the hunting grounds of the Chickahominy . The nation would starve , he said , unless transgressors were punished , and he reminded his listeners that , although they were always just and merciful , there were times when self-preservation required them to harden their hearts . His oratory stirred the people , they agreed heartily with all that he said , and they rejoiced that the eldest son of the Chief of Chiefs was so wise . When the time came for Powhatan to join his ancestors , Opachisco would deserve to succeed him . Four prisoners were led onto the field as the drum throbbed slowly and ominously , and the people jostled each other and craned their necks for a better view of the culprits . Pocahontas saw at once that the captiveswere Englishmen , and when she recognized John Smith she was so appalled that her mind would not function . She began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large stake near the rock and was lashed to it , her eyes filled with tears . His carriage was proud , and in spite of her anguish she gloried in the nobility he displayed ; she felt with him and for him and she wanted everyone present to know that she loved him . He was looking straight at her and , blinking away theP92tears , she met his gaze . She was shocked by the violent , undisguised hatred that blazed in his eyes and she shuddered as though he had struck her across the face . Surely there had been some terrible mistake or misunderstanding , and she turned to her father in appeal , but he seemed to be unaware of her and was looking stonily at Smith over the top of her head . But he was more conscious of her than she realized , for when she would have risen and gone to Smith , Powhatan 's grip on her shoulder tightened and he compelled her to remain seated . After a fierce inner struggle she subsided , for she had never disobeyed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifetime . Opachisco spoke again and said that three of the transgressors had been guilty of comparatively minor offenses , hence their punishment would be light , and when they had paid for their crime they would be sent to their homes so they could warn their brothers that the vengeance of the Chickahominy was swift and dire . At his direction Smith 's companionswere stripped , and then the squaws were invited to scourge them . The women surged forward and began to beat them enthusiastically with sticks and strips of rawhide , and so many wanted to participate in the sport that they crowded and shoved each other in their eagerness to administerthe whipping . Suddenly John Smith 's voice rose loud and clear above the tumult . " Courage , lads ! " he shouted , knowing his followers had not understood a word of what Opachisco had said . " They are n't going to kill you and they 'll soon set you free . Accept your ordeal now , so you can fight later . Be strong , for God and King James ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did not seem to notice the blow . Pocahontas 's command of English was sufficient for her to understand all he had told his men , and she felt a thrill of admiration for him . Only a leader of great , selfless valor could forget his own danger and try to help his retainers at a time like this , and she thought that even though he had rejected her for some reason she could not fathom , she had not given her love to one who was unworthy of it . When the battered Englishmen began to droop , Opachisco called a halt to the proceedings and ordered them cut down . Their clothes were flung at them , and they were ordered to leave the land of the Chickahominyat once . They stood groggily , uncomprehending , and they turned to Smith for guidance . He , indifferent to the blow he knew he would receive , did not fail them . " Follow the river downstream to James-P93town ! " he called . " Go at once , before they change their minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here  --  but remember me ! " Obeying him , they picked up their clothes and staggered off , followed by some of the Indian children , who threw stones after them . When they disappeared from sight all attention centered on Smith , and a pleasurable anticipatory murmur ran through the crowd . Pocahontas was quivering , and although she was completely ignorant of what was to be done to him , she knew she would not be able to watch if he was subjected to torture . She felt ill and wanted to flee from the sacred clearing , but she was powerless to move . Her place was here , not as a loyal member of the Chickahominy , but as a woman who loved Smith , whose sole desire was to help him . Shifting slightly , she caught hold of her father 's hand , which still pressed against her shoulder . " Will Powhatan show pity to his daughter and hear her plea ? " she whispered . He gave no sign that he had heard her but gestured abruptly with his right hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreigners had begun . Opachisco walked to Smith and , drawing a knife , cut the thongs that held the prisoner to the stake . " Smith , King of James , " he said , " will bow his head to the Chief of Chiefs . " Smith walked slowly to the base of the rock and looked up at Powhatan . He held himself erect and , not deigning to bow before the savage , he smiled insolently . In the hours since the insane offer to marry Pocahontashad been made to him he had thought of nothing else , and he found it impossible to believe that he would be deprived of his life because he refused . Powhatan was a splendid actor and was putting on a magnificent show in an attempt to frighten him , but the Indian had demonstrated his real intentions when he had released the other Englishmenwithout inflicting permanent injury on them , and Smith refused to be deceived . " I am here , " he said confidently . Powhatan 's face was as stiff as the masks his people wore at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has heard the word of Powhatan , " he declared solemnly , " and he knows the choice that is before him . " " There is no choice , " the captain replied impudently . " Powhatan has already heard my answer . " " Then Smith must die , " the Chief of Chiefs said flatly , and the si- f lence that followed was broken only by the sound of Pocahontas 's chokinggasp . P94The execution of chiefs could be performed only by their equals , not their inferiors , and heavy clubs were handed to Opachisco and Dalan ; as the eldest and youngest sons of Powhatan they were privileged to beat Smith to death . Two other sons of the Chief of Chiefs caught hold of his arms and forced him to his knees at the base of the sacred rock , and the people moved forward to obtain a better view . Opachisco caught hold of his head and placed it against the steep incline , and Smith , glancing up at him , grinned . They were certainly going to extraordinary lengths to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as death itself as she looked down at him , and she marveled at his courage . How he could smile now was beyond her comprehension , and she wondered if he realized that in a few moments the heavy clubs her brothers held would crash down on his head and smash it like an eggshell . She wanted to scream at the top of her voice , to leap from the rock and snatch the clubs from Opachisco and Dalan , but her torment was so great that she was like one in a trance and could not move . Smith glanced up at her , intending to show her that he knew she and her family were merely deceiving him , but when he saw her face his sardonic smile froze on his lips . Never had he seen such horror and anguish in the expression of another person , and at that instant he realized that Powhatan was not tricking him but was literally intending to have him put to death . As a civilized man he had erred in interpreting the mind of a lusty , vengeful savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that error with his life . A chill came over him , and then beads of perspiration dripped from his brow and almost blinded him . But his ability to think quickly and calmly was unimpaired , and he knew precisely what had to be done . In his years of experiences with women he had become expert in the art of flirting with them , and he needed to utilize all of that knowledge here and now , at once . With a great effort he forced himself to smile up at Pocahontas , and in his expression there were passion and longing , eager desire and deep yearning . Most of all his eyes seemed to tell her that together they could enjoy a future that would be rich and full and dazzling . With a wild , fierce cry , inarticulate yet clearly indicating her feminine strength and resolve to all who heard it , she felt suddenly liberated from her stupor . Her father 's hand was no longer on her shoulder , and with nothing to halt her she threw herself down the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air , she caught hold of Smith 's head and shielded him with her own body . She cradled his head against her breast , and they clung to each other . Smith , who had always thought of himself as self-sufficient , was grateful for the soft warmth of the slender body that protected him , and having been badly frightened for the first time in his life , he looked up at her with an ardor that was more real than simulated . Pocahontas , realizing dimly that Opachisco and Dalan had lowered their clubs , returned Smith 's gaze with adoration , and the emotions they both felt were an irresistible magnet drawing them even closer together . His arms tightened around her , she hugged him to her with a possessivenessthat was tender yet fierce , maternal yet filled with desire , and , conscious only of each other , they kissed . The crowd was astonished , and Pocahontas 's brothers looked at each other in bewilderment before tossing aside the clubs they would now have no opportunity to use . But Powhatan showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a trace of a satisfied smile on his lips . He had judged Pocahontas correctly , which was not difficult , of course , as he knew her so well , but he was pleased because he had known how Smith would react too . So far all had happened precisely as he wished , and that was good . But the incident was not yet ended : Smith had to be taught a lesson in humility before he would become a devoted husband and a loyal son-in-law . P96Pocahontas and Smith were still locked in each other 's arms as Powhatan stood and raised his right hand in a stiff , formal gesture . The people of the Chickahominy , who had been muttering to each other in wonder , immediately fell silent . " The gods have spoken , " their ruler declared sonorously , " and the daughter of the Chief of Chiefs will become the squaw of Smith . " He paused to allow his auditors time to absorb the full meaning of his words and , as he had expected , he saw that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed him without questionfor so many years that he had been certain they would cause no trouble now , even though the proposed marriage of a member of the ruler 's family to a foreigner was without precedent . Pocahontas , who was too dazed to think coherently , leaned back in Smith 's arms and sighed gently , her face radiant . Her future husband , relieved that his life was no longer in jeopardy , was already developing one or two schemes that might enable him to avoid the commitment and told himself that Powhatan had jumped to a convenient conclusion . He himself had never agreed in so many words to marry the girl and he felt under no obligation to her simply because she had chosen to save him . However , he kept his thoughts to himself and tactfully returned her luminous smile . Powhatan continued to hold his hand high , indicating that he had not concluded his remarks . " Smith will become a son of the Chief of Chiefs , " he declared , " so he did no wrong when he killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this deed . " It was possible that a few members of his audience doubted his ability to interpret the reactionsof their deities to the affair with such facility , but apparently noP97one was inclined to enter into a dispute with a man who had the power of life and death over all . The sovereign looked out at his people and knew instinctively that they were restless . The reason for their vague dissatisfaction was immediately apparent to him : they had been looking forward to witnessing a deed of violence and they felt cheated because Smith 's life had been spared . In part , Powhatan 's success lay in his ability to gratify his subjects ' whims , particularly when a gesture cost him nothing . And their present desire was one he could fulfill with ease ; their mood and his plans coincided perfectly . " When a youth becomes a warrior and sits at the councils of his elders , " he said , " he must first prove he has courage . He must be tried by fire and by water , by hunger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own people , not a youth , so the Chickahominy will not mock him by asking him to accept these trials . " Powhatan privately considered the tests of manhood far too simple for one who already had endured far worse withoutflinching . " But he must prove his right to take the daughter of the Chief of Chiefs as his squaw . So he will show that he is a true warrior by running the Race of the Damned . The gods have spoken , and Powhatanhas spoken . " He resumed his seat , and the people cheered loudly . Smith , who had no idea what was expected of him , realized only that Powhatan had found a way to punish him for his intransigence after all . He glanced at Pocahontas and saw that she was troubled , but she answered his unspoken question with a reassuring smile . " Only the weak and the fainthearteddie when they run the Race of the Damned , " she said , her attitudeindicating that she intended her words to be soothing . " But Smith , who has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Before he could reply , Opachisco tapped him impatiently on the shoulder , and he released the girl , then stood . More than two hundred senior warriors , he saw , were forming a double line , facing each other , leaving a space approximately four feet wide between the rows . Some were armed with knives , others held sticks , and quite a few flourished the short rawhide whips their squaws had used to scourge his companions from Jamestown . He knew what was expected of him without being told : he would be required to run the gantlet between the two rows , and if he reached the far end intact , the Indians would judge that he had passed the trial . However , should he stumble and fall somewhere along the line , they would consider it their right to beat him mercilessly . By no stretch of the imagination was the prospect of the ordeal pleas-P98ant , but he consoled himself with the thought that at least he would not be killed without being given a chance to defend himself . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would survive . He looked at Pocahontas , who smiled at him tremulously , and he knew she was powerlessto intervene again . She had already done all she could for him , and he would need to depend on himself alone in the trial . Then he saw Powhatan looking down at him from the crest of the rock , and their eyes met in a mutual challenge . Smith stared boldly at the Chief of Chiefs and then turned to Opachisco , who was waiting to conduct him to the head of the line . " Is one who runs the Race of the Damned allowed to wear what he pleases for the test ? " The eldest son of Powhatan pondered the question briefly . " Those who have run the race have worn garments of many kinds , " he replied slowly . " Then , " Smith said crisply , " I will wear a loincloth such as the braves of the Chickahominy wear when they hunt in the forests . " It would be too difficult for him to attain any speed in his cumbersome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , that a brave might impede his progress by catching hold of his sleeve or his thick ruff . An idea occurred to him , and he added , " Let him who brings the loincloth also bring some of the venison fat that the squaws use when they cook . " Some of those who heard his request were puzzled , but Opachisco looked at him admiringly , and even Powhatan was impressed . The items Smith wanted were quickly provided and he accepted them eagerly . This was no time for false modesty , and even though there were many hundreds of women in the crowd , he stripped to the skin and energetically rubbed himself with chunks of the animal fat . When he thought his body had become as slippery and difficult to grasp as he could make it , he wound the loincloth around him , twisted it into shape , and made it secure . Then , his shoulders and back glistening in the late afternoon sun , he saluted Pocahontas smartly , half in jest and half in earnest , and walked with Opachisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to run ? " he asked , halting about ten yards from the first two braves , both of whom were holding thick , gnarled sticks . To the best of Opachisco 's knowledge this was the first time the questionhad ever been raised , and he shrugged . " Good . I 'll begin right here . " Smith dug his toes into the hard earth and started to sprint toward the lane between the two lines . It was obvi-P99ous to him that the greater his speed as he reached his tormentors , the less time and opportunity they would have to injure him seriously . As Smith ran he deliberately put all thoughts of future complications out of his mind and concentrated on his immediate problem . He needed more than luck to stay alive or , at the least , to avoid permanent injury , and if he succeeded now there would be ample opportunity later to deal with Pocahontas . The warriors who were waiting to maul him were primitive men , he reminded himself , and they would employ elementary techniques in their efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks were dangerous , because they would try to trip him , and he would need to evade those who carried clubs , too , for their blows might stun him . If he could maintain sufficient speed , knives would scarcely touch him , and the rawhide whips would do the least harm of all ; they might sting him and cut into his flesh but they could not halt him . He lifted his knees high , pumping his legs in rhythmic thrusts as he reached the first two braves , and , lowering his head , he plunged down the narrow path between the two rows . The men who formed the gantlet were shouting at him derisively in an attempt to confuse and frighten him , and the spectators were screaming for blood , but he shut out the sounds of their voices . Sprinting nimbly down the lane , he danced and weaved from one side to the other , avoiding the sticks aimed at his ankles and legs . Whenever he saw a heavy bludgeon he headed straight for the brave who held it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he darted away again . But it was impossible to escape the less severe blows that rained on his head , his shoulders , and his back , and he made no attempt to sidestepthem . Occasionally a sharp , shooting sensation in his side or neck told him that a knife point or a stick had dug into him , but these inconveniencesdid not slow his pace . The lashes raised ugly welts on his arms and thighs , and one whip cut deep into his forehead , but he consideredhimself fortunate because the blood that was drawn from the wound trickled down the side of his face rather than into his eyes . His head throbbed , but he still knew precisely what he was doing , and he retained his ability to think coolly . When he reached a point about halfway down the line , he realized that the blows were becoming more frequent and intense , and it suddenlyoccurred to him that he had allowed himself to fall into a pattern by running three steps forward , then leaping to the left , racing three more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to predicthis movements , and as a consequence he had become an easier tar/get for them to hit . Altering his tactics abruptly , he squandered precious breath by weaving crazily from side to side , but even though he appeared to be unsure of himself now , his goal was unchanged , he continued to drive forward , and each step he took carried him closer to the end of the long line . A thick club , heavy enough to kill him had it landed on his head , crashed into his left shoulder , and his whole body seemed to be enveloped in a sheet of flame . The pain was so intense that it numbed him for a moment , and he reeled dizzily into the center of the path . The warriors redoubled their efforts to send him sprawling , and a stick that nicked his right instep sent him plunging into a husky brave , almostknocking the man down . They clung to each other for an instant , and the spectators began to chant triumphantly . The sound of their voices penetrated Smith 's consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grappling with him , he lurched back into the clear . He forced himself forward again grimly ; his tired legs responded to his will at last , and gradually he managed to pick up speed , to the astonishment of his tormentors , who had expected him to collapse . But he was too exhausted to move once more at his initial pace , and the braves who still waited for him were able to strike him without difficulty , for he lacked the energy now to confuse them with agile footwork . Nevertheless , he continued to inch his way toward the last two men who lined the path , and his ability to absorb punishment that would have halted a lesser man seemed to be limitless . He had always been strong , and the life he had led since he had gone to sea at the age of fifteen had given him a physique and a stamina that few could equal , but more than his robust constitution and his reservoir of muscular energy kept him in motion . He was filled with a determination to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever been his master , and he did not propose to be vanquished by ignorant heathens whose sole measurement of an individual 's worth was brute strength . Smith told himself groggily that he who had conversed with the most learned men of England and Europe and Islam was not going to end his days as the victim of stupid Naturals who were totally lacking in intelligence . He was meeting them on their own level , allowingthem to test him by their standards , and neither their clubs nor their whips could deprive him of ultimate victory over them . Even the warriors who beat at him felt reluctant admiration for him as he pushed relentlessly toward the end of the line , and a number of the spectators , sympathizing with him in spite of their antipathy to for/eigners , groaned aloud when he dropped to his hands and knees just before he reached the last two braves . For a moment it appeared that he was helpless and that these warriors would beat him into unconsciousness . But he drew on reserves hitherto unknown to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a skill that was remarkable in one who could no longer think clearly . He was free now , and the gantlet was behind him ; the knives and sticks of the warriors no longer tormented him , but the blanket of pain that covered him , the agony that penetrated into every part of his body was still shattering . He knew he had won , but one final gesture remainedbefore he would be satisfied and , after sucking in air and resting for a moment , he pulled himself to his feet . He wanted to say something , but knew he lacked the strength to speak , and the ground was rising and falling so rapidly beneath his feet that he was afraid he would fall . Raising his head proudly , he looked back at the double line of warriors and saw they were watching him . A twisted smile appeared on his bloody , swollen face , and he laughed at them , hoarsely and triumphantly , before he collapsed . Warriors and spectators alike crowded around him and stared down at him with respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbandfor the daughter of Powhatan , and when Pocahontas ran to him from the rock at the far side of the sacred clearing , they quickly moved aside for her . She saw that he was still conscious and she stood very still as she offered a silent prayer of thanks , first to the God of the Christians , then to the gods of her ancestors , for having preserved him . Suddenlyshe turned , and the people noted her resemblance to her father in the way she held herself . " Let a bed of soft boughs be brought at once , " she said , and a numberof braves who had never in their lives obeyed an order given by a woman responded to the ring of command in her voice . A litter of the kind normally used to carry corn from the fields to the storehouses was quickly provided , and Pocahontas , taking complete charge , directed several squaws to arrange buffalo robes on it to make it softer . She herself helped to lift Smith gently onto the bedding , and two of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shoulders . " Let Smith be taken now to the house of the daughter of the Chief of Chiefs , " she told them , and as they carried him off toward the hill she took her place directly behind him like a dutiful squaw . Powhatan , following them at a short distance , frowned and waved away those who wanted to speak to him . He wanted time to think andp102he was disturbed because Pocahontas had already taken matters into her own hands . It was unprecedented for Smith to be lodged in her house ; by rights he should be given a hut of his own in which to recuperate , and under no circumstances was it proper for him to live under his squaw 's roof until they were married . But it was obvious that she intended to nurse him back to health , and Powhatan , knowing how she felt , lacked the heart to refuse her the privilege . Besides , he had no wish to countermand a public order she had given and he was afraid that in her present mood she might disobey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were far easier to raise than daughters , and he was relieved that Pocahontas would soon be married . He toyed with the idea of having the ceremony performed at once , but regretfully abandoned the thought . It would be far safer to hold the rites now , of course , and that would save him the bother of posting guards outside Pocahontas 's house later , to prevent Smith 's possible escape when he recovered his strength . But it would be best to preserve tradition , he decided . The marriage ritual would be arduous , the wedding feast would last for hours , and Smith would not be able to play his proper part in the ceremonies until he was sound and hearty again . Powhatan sighed and almost regrettedthe vengeful impulse that had made Smith an invalid , but there were consolations , and the conviction that the pale-skinned young chief would be far easier to handle in the future was not the least of them . And it was satisfying to reflect that through his ingenuity he had solved his daughter 's problems and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who occasionally caught a glimpse of Pocahontas certainly realized that she had never looked happier , even though she was busier than ever before in her life . She gave her own bed to Smith and uncomplainingly slept on the ground in the far corner , after sending Ru-Sa elsewhere . She waited on the injured Englishman day and night , and although her father offered to send experiencedsquaws to relieve her , she refused to allow anyone else to come near him . She prepared rich broths and other nourishing foods for him , and at first , when he was too weak to lift a bowl to his lips , she fed him his meals , sometimes coaxing him , now and then urging him firmly when he had no appetite . Whenever she could spare the time , she cooked a fresh batch of the herb and moss poultice that reduced his fever , and each night at sundown , before he drifted off to sleep , she patiently appliedthe evil-smelling medicine to his cuts and bruises . Thanks to her ministrations , he began to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the end of a week he wasp103able to converse with Pocahontas for brief periods . She would not permithim to sit up , however , and when she gave him orders she spoke to him with such crisp authority that he obeyed her meekly , much to his own surprise . He watched her in silence for hours at a time as she moved around the room and he often marveled at the change that had come over her . She was no longer shy or unsure of herself , and although no task seemed too menial or unpleasant for her , she carried herself with a new air of mature dignity . Her girlish buoyancy , which had irritated Smith , was gone , and in its place was an attitude of earnest , sober purpose . She was still young , of course , and now , as previously , he was as much aware of her fresh appeal as he was conscious of her beauty . It was impossible for him to lose sight of the obvious when they lived under the same roof , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very different from the naive girl to whom he had made love in the Jamestown blockhouse . After several days of pondering the matter , he realized what had happened to her and he was annoyed with himself for his lack of perceptivity . Pocahontas was a woman whose dearest wish had been granted . She had what she wanted and she was determined to keep it , to let nothing on earth interfere with her happiness . Her single-minded devotion to him was upsetting , and he secretly cursed the day they had met . He had often been told that few women were capable of such dedicated love , and he thought sourly that it had been his ill fortune to become entangled with one of them . Pocahontas would unquestionably be a perfectwife , but he had no desire to be married , particularly to a savage . The very idea of appearing at Whitehall with her and presenting her to King James was so disturbing that his fever rose for a day and a night , and Pocahontas made matters all the worse by daubing him with fresh quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convalescence passed more rapidly , for she permitted him to sit up for longer and longer periods , and each day he felt stronger . He discovered that her command of English had improved greatly , and it was flattering to realize that she had spent the whole of the summer studying his language . Although he had all but forgotten her after her visit to Jamestown , she had been working assiduously with no purpose in mind other than to please him when they next met . It was a novelty to be able to chat with her freely , and as there was nothing else to occupy his time during his enforced confinement in this land of savages , he took a renewed interest in her . P104Pocahontas listened so attentively to every word he said that he thoroughlyenjoyed showing off his learning to her . She was fascinated by his descriptions of the world he had known before he had come to Americaand she rarely disputed his word . By tacit mutual consent neither of them mentioned his own personal situation , and Smith was grateful to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lack of intellect and background irritated him . Her infrequent attempts to express her own opinions invariably annoyed him , too , for not only was she a woman and thus completely illogical , but her strange Indian approach to any topic made her views meaningless . The question of religion seemed to be much on her mind , and she brought it up at every opportunity , but Smith 's knowledge of theology was limited and in two or three brief discussions he told her all he knew . However , he was unwilling to admit his ignorance of anything , and one afternoon , when Pocahontas again brought up the subject of God , he began to tell her glibly of the dissensions that had split England since King Henry VIII had broken off relations with the Pope and had establishedhis own church . Pocahontas made no comment until he mentioned the name of Sir Thomas More , and then suddenly she smiled . " He was a very wise man , " she said . Smith was so surprised that he forgot what he had been saying ; controllingan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her quizzically . She rose from her place at the side of his bed and hurried across the room to a small carved chest in which she kept her most precious possessions , her books . She took one , returned to Smith , and , seating herself cross-legged on the ground , began to flip rapidly through the pages . Her serious absorption amused him , and it occurred to him that she was really one of the most attractive wenches he had ever known . But he warned himself sternly not to let himself think too much about her pretty face and pert figure ; they had already caused enough difficulties for him . Pocahontas found what she was seeking and looked pleased . " It was Sir Thomas More who said , Assist me up , and in coming down I will shift for myself . ' " " So he did , " Smith murmured . " That was a very wonderful remark . " She repeated it silently , her lips moving and her eyes solemn . He wondered what had made him think such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one elbow . She was an uneducatedp105primitive , and her pretentiousness angered him . " What do you know of Sir Thomas More ? " he demanded . " Nothing , " Pocahontas replied simply , " except that he said something very true . His remark reminds me of you and me . " " How can you possibly understand what a man said unless you know who he was and why he said it ? " Smith asked crossly . It would be typical of her to quote some absurd legend about one of her pagan gods to justify her argument , he told himself . " John Smith has helped me and has taught me much . But someday , if I study long and hard , he will not need to assist me any more , " she assured him earnestly . " Sir Thomas , " he declared sententiously , " was Lord Chancellor of England . " He had no intention of describing the position itself to her , so that would end the subject , and he could return to his previous topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to hear him . " When the day comes that I gain wisdom , I will know as much as John Smith . " The very idea was so ridiculous that he refused to dignify it with a comment . Obviously she was incapable of understanding that she was a benighted savage , and her effrontery in even daring to presume that she would become the equal of a man who would soon be recognized as one of the great savants of the age was childish . " Sir Thomas , " he said acidly , " was also a noted astronomer , a distinguished mathematician , and a renowned author . I dare say you 've never heard of his great study of civilization , Utopia . " " Utopia , " she replied , memorizing the word . " I hope there is a copy in Jamestown , so I may read it . " She would never again go near Jamestown if he had anything to say about it , but this was not the time to tell her that she had no place in his plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and when she looked blank , he added condescendingly , " He was a man who thought much about God and knew a great deal about Him . " Pocahontas was delighted . " Then I will surely read his book . And it proves that what I felt about him was right . " Smith wished he had n't brought the name of More into the conversation . " How does it prove anything ? " " When one knows much about God , all that he writes and says must be true , " she answered brightly . " So it is as I have spoken . John Smith assists me . He teaches me all that he knows , so I will also become very wise . " Evidently the young and inexperienced of every land were alikep106and were confidently certain they could mold the shape of the future to fit their preconceived patterns . " No one person in the world can ever learn all there is to know , and when I am wise , then I will help John Smith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated by private tutors , had ever dared to think that her intellectual attainments could be useful to him , and he was outraged . But he forcibly reminded himself that he was still Powhatan 's prisoner and consequently worded his rejection of her offer obliquely . " Do you know when Sir Thomas made the comment you admire so much ? On the execution block , a few moments before he lost his head defying his King . " Pocahontas 's expression was smug . " Sir Thomas More knew many things about God and man that his King did not . " " I suppose he did , " Smith said uncertainly . " Then he was much like John Smith , whose knowledge is greater than that of the Chief of Chiefs . " Obviously the analogy that existed in her mind strengthened her conviction . " The father of Pocahontas wanted to kill John Smith . " The memory of the incident depressed her , but after a moment of reflection she became brighter . " All that is in the past , and we waste our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the day when we will help each other . " She could dream as much as she pleased , he told himself bitterly , but her fancies would never be realized . She did not know it , but she had done him a favor , for by letting him see that she envisioned a permanent future for herself at his side , she had strengthened his determination to be rid of her as soon as he recovered his health . Her presence during his convalescence was convenient , of course , and he would enjoy living with her for a short time when he was strong again , provided there were no lasting complications . It was unfortunate that she thought of herself as a real wife , but he had only himself to blame . Had he not taught her English and given her a Bible , she would have remained unspoiled . Underthe circumstances there was only one way to terminate the present fruitless and dangerous conversation and , pretending to grow drowsy , he turned his back to her and closed his eyes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smith continued to improve each day and he devoted himself with increasing energy to the problem of working out a sensible escape plan . A score of ideas occurred to him , but he was forced to reject all of them ; some were too involved , some were not practical , and some were far too simple . He had gained a grudging respect for Powhatan 's cunning , and realizingp107that the Chief of Chiefs had successfully trapped him into making a marriage contract even though he had not agreed in so many words to wed Pocahontas , it was logical to assume that he would be watched closely until she became his wife . When he was strong enough to stand and walk from one end of the hut to the other , he discovered that he had made a correct estimate of the situation . Four warriors , all armed with English muskets , stood guard outside the house day and night , and when he went outdoors for short strolls with Pocahontas , two others always followed them at a short distance . He asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied that her father had assigned the braves to protect him . Apparentlyshe herself accepted this explanation without question and , as nearly as Smith could judge , the possibility that he might try to escape had never crossed her mind . He immediately thought there must be some way to utilize her innocenceto his advantage , but the attitude of the warriors indicated clearly that they were acting under direct orders from Powhatan and would refuse to obey the girl if she tried to send them away . One afternoon , when he and Pocahontas took a walk past Powhatan 's lodge , he tested the scheme by suggesting that she dismiss the braves . She thought he wanted to be alone with her and promptly followed his advice , for she could see no reason why he needed protection even from the most vengeful members of the tribe , when they were so close to her father 's own house , where not even the most rashly courageous would dare to attack the Chief of Chiefs ' guest and future son-in-law . But the warriorsblithely ignored Pocahontas 's request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unwitting ally . He frequently toyed with the idea of stealing some weapons , overpoweringthe guards late at night , and making a break for freedom , but he gave up that plan , too , when he realized that the Chickahominy , with their superior knowledge of the wilderness , would catch him in the forests or on the river and bring him back . One other factor also deterred him from taking bold action : he knew that even if he should manage to escape and return to Jamestown , Powhatan would not drop the affair but would probably wage war against the whole colony if the settlers gave him shelter . As his own future would be ruined if Jamestownshould be destroyed , he consequently would gain nothing even if he found some way to escape and return there . Smith spent long hours brooding over the situation , and Pocahontas , aware that he was morose , concluded that he was homesick for his ownp108people . She was afraid that his state of mind would retard his recovery and tried to think of something that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth he had given her on his first visit to the land of the Chickahominy , and one day the idea of making herself a dress like that worn by the women of Jamestown crossed her mind . If she could duplicatesuch a garment , she told herself , he would be pleased and would certainly recover his health more rapidly . She often recognized his rejection of her in his expression or his tone of voice , but she was certain he loved her and , after spending a great deal of time pondering the subject , she became convinced that if she made herself the English gown he would not only demonstrate his affection for her more openly but would be able to visualize her place in their joint life more clearly . Ru-Sa had often told her that men lacked imagination , and for once Ru-Sa was right ; Smith 's attitude made it plain that he felt uncomfortable at the prospect of spending the rest of his days with a woman who looked like a Chickahominy squaw , but when she appeared before him in the attire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry him would quickly regain the weight he had lost . He usually slept for an hour or two after each of his meals , and she took advantage of this time by quietly leaving the house and going to the nearby hut of Opachisco , whose senior wife was very clever with a bone needle and knife and made most of the family 's ceremonial robes . They worked together for two weeks , and at last the gown was ready . One afternoon , after Smith had finished a stew of goat meat and had dropped off , Pocahontas hurried out to put on the dress and surprise him when he awoke . She was so excited that her hands trembled as she donned the dress , and the admiration of Opachisco 's wife gave her increasedconfidence ; her plan , she reflected as she struggled into the unfamiliargarments , was certain to succeed . The sleeves of her close-fitting bodice , or doublet , of the natural cream wool were padded with soft , dried moss and had strips of the bright blue satin set in under long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wore broad bracelets of dyed and plaited porcupine quills sewn onto bands of deerskin at her wrists . Her long blue satin skirt was held out stiffly by an improvised farthingale , or stiffened petticoat , made of woven reeds . Her ruff was unlike any she had seen in Jamestown and was made of multicoloredfeathers . It had been impossible for her to duplicate the shoes worn by the pale-skinned Englishwomen , and after several futile attempts to re-create them , she and Opachisco 's wife had given up their efforts . Neither Poca-P109hontas 's best moccasins nor her newest sandals looked appropriate with the dress , so she compromised by wearing no shoes at all , and when she was dressed she walked barefooted back to her own house . As the people of the town were not permitted to approach the crest of Powhatan 's hill , only a few of her relatives and the guards assigned to watch John Smith saw her , but she was so occupied with her own thoughts that she did not realize that the women were looking at her enviously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hut she heard Smith stirring inside and knew he was awake and , pausing at the entrance , she peered into the room . He was pacing up and down restlessly , as he did so often these days , and her heart began to pound furiously . Pocahontas did not speak , and Smith , although he obviously knew she had returned , said nothing either and greeted her with an absent nod . She was so anxious to attract his attention that she wanted to shout , but instead she stood just inside the door flap and waited for him to notice her . She was so still that eventually he realized something out of the ordinary was taking place , and he glanced idly at her without pausing or breaking the rhythm of his stride . Then suddenly he halted abruptly and gaped at her . Pocahontas proudly submitted herself to his inspection and stood erect , with her arms at her sides after the manner of the women she had seen in Jamestown . She had imagined this scene so often that she could have closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unexpected , acute sense of self-consciousness not made her uncomfortable . In spite of her embarrassment , however , she was sure in her own mind that he would approve , that his sense of inner disturbance would vanish , and that he would understand precisely why she had gone to such pains to please him . To her astonishment and dismay he began to chuckle , and when she dared to raise her eyes she saw he was looking at her feet and laughing . She wanted to draw her toes under the protective cover of the long skirt , but pride forced her to remain still . It had never once crossed her mind that he might ridicule her , and she did not know how to cope with his amusement . The fear that she had failed flooded over her , and she wished that the evil gods who lived beneath the earth would swallow her , but they ignored her silent entreaties and left her to stand miserably , watching Smith 's broad grin . " No shoes ? " he asked . Unable to reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter at all , he would surely realize she knew nothing of bootmaking.  |p110Smith  looked her up and down slowly , and gradually the expression in his eyes changed . The smile faded from his lips , and he was amazed to find that she was as desirable in her outlandish imitation of an English gown as she was in her native Chickahominy dress . It was plain to him that she had gone to a great deal of trouble to make herself attractive to him , and after a brief , fierce struggle with himself , he decided to accept the inevitable . For the present , at least , escape from the Indian town was impossible , and he told himself he was being stupid not to seize whatever compensations were offered to him . Pocahontas , sensitive to every change in his moods , felt his amusementvanish , and a single glance at his face was enough for her to know that he wanted her . Her grief evaporated and she eagerly jumped to the conclusion that she had been mistaken : he had laughed because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her or mocking her . His blatantly obvious craving for her convinced her that what she wanted to believe was true , and she felt such a great surge of love for him that he responded at once and moved toward her . She had told herself repeatedly during the weeks of his convalescence that she would not give herself to him again until she became his wife , and although she was starved for his love , she put a hand against his chest and held him off . According to the standards of her own nation , she was right , and she knew , from all she had read in the Bible , that the English and other foreign tribes were even more strict in their attitude on the subject than were her own people . She could not blame Smith , to be sure ; he wanted her so much that he was impetuously discarding rules , but she had sworn not to break the law again . Smith had reappearedin her life after she had prayed to his God , she had promised Him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since she had made her vow , she would prove she could be strong . Smith was annoyed when Pocahontas gently pushed him away , but she continued to look radiant . " John Smith has been sick for many days , " she said . " Ris disappeared from the night sky and has come back again , yet it has taken all this time for John Smith to become strong . Each day I have seen him grow in health and now I know he is well . When a man wants a woman he is no longer sick . " Emotion overcame her , and she unconsciously reverted to her own tongue . " Pocahontas will tell her father what has happened , and the Chief of Chiefs will order the wedding to take place at once . " Once again , Smith thought , a snare had been set for him , and he had stepped into it with his eyes open.  |p111Drums  carried the glad tidings through the wilderness from village to village , and within a few days representatives of every nation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding of his only daughter to the foreigner from across the sea . Many chiefs came in person , attended by their wives , their elders , and their principal war lords , and the few rulers who were either too ill or too busy to make the journey sent their sons in their stead . Gifts from tribes as far distant as the Mohawk in the north and the Cherokee in the south were sent to Smith and his squaw , and Opachisco , who kept careful count to make certain that no nation slighted Powhatan'smajesty and power , told the bride-to-be that the belts of wampum and the foodstuffs she and Smith were receiving would make them wealthy . There were bullocks and cows from the northern tribes , huge baskets of dried fish from those who lived near the seacoast , and some of the lesser chiefs who lived in the interior brought whole carcasses of buffalo and bear with them . The Chesapeake created a minor crisis when they sent the bridegroom a young and pretty concubine , but Powhatan disposedof the problem quickly and firmly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl into his own household . Opachisco , jealous of his father , thereafter made certain that all present-bearing messengersreported first to him when they arrived . Housing facilities were strained , as each of the visiting dignitaries required a number of homes for himself and his entourage , and failure to provide a chief with the accommodations to which his rank entitled him would have caused serious repercussions . Dalan , who was in chargep112of these arrangements , was taxed beyond his experience and was forced to appeal to his father for help . Powhatan promptly ordered some new huts built near the sacred clearing , where the ceremony would be held , and the dilemma was solved . The Chickahominy warriors engaged in daily games and trials of strength with the visiting braves , and each night groups gathered around scores of fires to vie with each other in telling tales of their prowess at hunting and their skill in war . The squaws worked incessantly , cooking special dishes for the wedding feast and preparing meals in the meantimefor their families and the hordes of guests . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the artistically inclinedcomposed songs , created dances , and made the masks that a select group would be required to wear at the ceremony . The maidens spent long hours sewing , as it was customary for every unmarried girl to appearat a wedding only in something she herself had made . Powhatan took advantage of the visit of so many of his subsidiary chieftains by holding a series of individual conferences with them , impressingthem with his might and strengthening his hold over them . The powerful Seneca , who were as strong in the north as the Chief of Chiefs was in his own territory , sent the son and the brother of the ruling sachem to represent them , and Powhatan , recognizing them as equals , concluded a treaty with them in which each promised to respect the boundaries and the rights of the other . Ru-Sa , enjoying her day of greatest glory , was in charge of the arrangements for the feast by virtue of her position as the bride 's custodian , and she made life miserable for the cooks and mask makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced the unfortunates who were under her supervision to repeat their efforts whenever their work failed to meet her standards . Ru-Sa was determined to provide the weddingguests with a feast so bountiful that songs would be sung about it for years to come , and under her direction huge pots of meats simmered continually , special parties of hunters scoured the countryside for wild dogs to be made into stew , and fish , caught by the hundreds in the rivers and lakes , were smoked slowly over hickory logs . The first hint of autumn was in the air , and this was the season when every tribe laid aside stores for the months ahead , but Ru-Sa dipped into the supplies without thought for the future . Several of the elders became alarmed , but she would listen to no one , and finally Powhatan himself had to restrain her prodigal enthusiasm . Pocahontas took no part in the festivities preceding the wedding , andp113none of the visitors were permitted to see her . According to the inviolable traditions of her ancestors , a bride was required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wedding , and as Powhatan was considered the deputy of the gods , great care was taken to insure that his daughter observed custom . A tent of skins was erected for her in the center of the sacred clearing , and the squaws of eight of the most prominentelders were assigned to watch over her . They prepared her meals , they slept with her in the tent , and each day they performed private , mystic rites over her to prepare her for her future life . In times past a bride not only made the clothes she would wear at her wedding but first treated the raw skins as well ; however , the daughter of a mighty chief needed to dress in robes suitable to her rank , so Pocahontaswas given specially selected leather that had already been cured . But she made her own dyes , sewed the clothes herself , and glazed the white feathers that would stud her headband by painting them with the boiled gum of the little tree known as the prickly ash . This extraordinarily delicate task was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform , as they wore less ornate headdresses when they were married , but Pocahontas worked so diligently and cheerfully that the old squaws who attended her were impressed by both her skill and her disposition . They predicted that her marriage would be a happy one , and their views coincided with the opinions of three elderly warriors who had been appointed to read the omens for the future in the stars . Usually a bridegroom was surrounded by his relatives and friends duringthe two weeks preceding the wedding , but no invitations were extended to the colonists at Jamestown , and when Smith was moved from Pocahontas 's house to a lodge farther down the hill , the braves who lived there with him were under strict orders from Powhatan to keep him under observation at all times . Under no circumstances was he allowed to leave the town , and when several of the visiting chiefs politely asked him to accompany them on hunting trips , Powhatan himself hastily explained to the guests that the bridegroom could not accept as he was recuperating from an illness . Smith did participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held each day inside the ring of hills , and although he was woefullyinept in hitting a target with a tomahawk or knife , his prowess with a bow and arrow surprised the Naturals . At his request a contest was held in the firing of muskets , and Powhatan , after pondering the matter , decided that it would be safe enough to let Smith use a firestick , as there were too many warriors present for him to intimidate themP114and escape . Some of the Chickahominy had been practicing with the muskets they had received early in the summer , but they quickly discoveredthey were not in a class with Smith , and the competition was abandoned . Instead , Smith gave several exhibitions in target shooting , and the visitors from other tribes were awed by his skill . This suited Powhatan , who reasoned that his satellites and allies alike would be loath to wage war against a nation armed with fifty such powerful weapons . Somewhat to the surprise of the Chief of Chiefs , who kept an eye that was considerably more than paternal on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seemed to have accepted his lot . He joked readily with the warriors who guarded him , he ate heartily at the nightly pre-nuptial feasts , and his curiosity was as insatiable as it had been in the past . He sought out the visitors , particularly those who came from distant tribes , and he questioned them eagerly regarding the country in which they lived , their customs , and their language . They , of course , were flattered by his attention and they told Powhatan he was fortunate ; not many young chiefs were as wise as the pale-skinned foreigner . Two nights prior to the wedding all the guests had gathered , and after eating a rich stew of rabbit , boiled dog , and goat , the visitors and their hosts gathered around a fire . According to tradition , this was the night set aside to pay honor to the warrior who was going to be married , and the leaders of every tribe rose , one after another , to entertain Smith by regaling him with accounts of their exploits and their valor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he stood at last , he decided to tell them about some of his adventures in Islam . They could not picture the civilization he described and they were completely ignorant of the location of the countries of northern Africa and the Near East , but such minor details were unimportant . What mattered was that his tales were exciting , and he told his stories with deceptively simple artistry . The savages were a perfect audience and they responded to every word he uttered with such complete and absorbedattention that he soon found he was enjoying himself . Carried away by the fervor of the Indians , he began to embroider his accounts , and when he discovered they accepted everything he told them , he threw off all restraint . Romanticizing and fabricating , he mixed fact and fiction wildly , but the more preposterous his recital became , the more avidly they listened to him . Encouraged by their reaction , he made a mental note to include several of the stories in his future chronicles of his life in America . He would exercise greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tales to paper , but he would certainly tell the same stories , for he was pleased to find that he frequently struck something basic in human nature , so English readers would be sure to devour this same blend of truth and fancy . When he sat down the Naturals cheered him , and he relished their applause . He had been right , he thought , to give in gracefully to the unavoidable . Neither Powhatan nor any other Chickahominy , not even Pocahontas herself , had realized that the ceremony in which he was to participate was not really binding on him . The ceremony that would make Pocahontas his wife was a pagan ritual , and no English court would consider the marriage legal . He would be obliged to act the role of Pocahontas'shusband only for the brief time they would be together , and when he left her , which he would do at the first possible moment , he would be relieved of all responsibility for her and to her . The realization that any pledges he might be called upon to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him when he was forced to face the fact that he could not escape , and he was annoyed with himself for not having seen the matter clearly when he had first been brought here as a prisoner . Had he been more alert , and consequentlymore amenable , he could have saved himself the crippling pain that had been inflicted on him when he ran the Race of the Damned . He had not suffered in vain , however ; he knew better now and was conducting himself accordingly . He would say and do whatever was requiredof him at the wedding , and when he deserted Pocahontas , his conscience would be clear . The natives could think of him as her husbandall they pleased , but under English law and in his own eyes he would still be a bachelor . His one concern was the attitude of the girl herself , and he was afraid she might stumble on the truth . She spent at least an hour each day reading the Bible he had so foolishly given her , and conceivably it might dawn on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianceremony were performed . If she should be sufficiently intelligent to make such a request of him  --  and he no longer underestimated her shrewdness  --  he would have to use all of his powers of persuasion to convince her that it was unnecessary to be married a second time . Smith 's spirits remained high , and when the day of the wedding arrivedhe knew that he was using the right tactics , for Powhatan , impressed by his willingness to co-operate , returned his steel helmet and corselet to him , together with his sword . His boots were shabby , and his shirt , which Pocahontas had carefully mended for him with strands ofp116wool from her precious bolt of cloth , was threadbare , but he had no other . He had not acquired the knack of shaving with a sharp Indian knife in cold water and he cut his face several times while scraping off his beard , but he was buoyant as he dressed . He was hungry , but when Opachisco , who came to escort him to the sacred clearing , told him he was forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no complaint . Soon he would be his own master again , and in the meantime petty disturbances could not upset him . A huge throng had gathered in the clearing to witness the ceremony , and people stared at Pocahontas 's tent , hoping in vain to detect some sign of movement inside . Two of the old squaws blocked the entrance , however , and successfully hid the bride , who would make her appearance at the appropriate moment in the ceremony . The visiting chiefs were gathered at the base of the flat-topped rock at one end of the field , and all had daubed themselves liberally with paint . Perched on the side of the rock were the representatives of the sachem of the Seneca , who had been granted this special honor as a sign of their host 's esteem . All of Pocahontas 's brothers except Opachisco stood in a circle around her tent , knives in their right hands , symbolizing the belief that a bride was inviolate and that anyone who wanted to carry her off would first be forced to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a squaw at the end of the ceremony . The women of Powhatan'sfamily , who usually stayed in the background , enjoyed unique privileges at weddings , and they sat on the ground between the tent and the rock so they could see everything that happened . Opachisco 's two small sons , wearing unaccustomed loincloths , sat with their mothers and were forcibly restrained when they tried to dart off and play with their friends at the edge of the crowd . Weddings meant nothing to them , but as members of the Chief of Chiefs ' family they were not free to do as they pleased . This was particularly true of the older of the boys , who was five ; he would someday become the ruler of the nation and of the Confederation , provided he survived the harsh tests that would begin when he reached the age of seven summers . Sixteen masked drummers , each of them representing one of the major gods of the Chickahominy , struck up a rhythmic beat when Opachisco and John Smith appeared , walking side by side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the rock on which he had almostlost his life . Smith , looking at the smiling faces of the savages , was gratified at the friendliness they expressed . Most of them obviously respectedhim , and those braves who had tried to beat him into insensi/bility when he had run the gantlet showed warm regard for him . Only a few of the younger unmarried warriors , who had hoped to win Pocahontasthemselves , displayed any hostility to him , and he ignored their stony glares . He enjoyed the good will of the majority , which was important , for he would he free to come and go as he pleased when they began to take his continued presence in their community for granted . The throb of the drums became louder , and Powhatan , followed by the elders of his council , walked solemnly onto the field and mounted the rock . His robe , which he wore only at festivals of religious significance , was unique , and the people fell silent as they gazed at it . When it was draped over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even the guests who worshiped their own gods rather than those of the Chickahominy looked at him in awe . The outer side of the skin was painted with yellow circles signifying Ek and silver crescents symbolizingRis . Jagged red splotches around the neck meant that he was the representative of Ti-Ba , the god of fire , and the bright blue panels at the front of the robe indicated that he was the deputy of Gan , the water god . And most impressive of all , a jagged orange line down the center of his back was the emblem of Rito-fer , the god of lightning , who , in the opinion of some medicine men , had been the original founder of the tribe and was Powhatan 's ancestor . Opachisco , acting as the family 's spokesman , approached the rock and asked for permission to begin . Powhatan nodded benignly , and the elders , each of whom carried two dry sticks , laid them in a pile of kindling . A flaming torch was carried into the clearing by the youngest of the Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the child faltered , almost burning herself , the drums beat still more loudly to concealher blunder . Opachisco took the torch from her and plunged it into the pile of wood ; in a moment the flames leaped high in the air , and Smith was invited to step forward . He was dismayed when Opachisco , gesturing broadly , indicated that he was to walk into the fire . There was a chance that he would be burned severely , and at the very least his boots , the only pair he had brought into the wilderness , would be badly scorched . He was relieved when Opachisco whispered to him that he need not actually set foot in the flames , so he paused and merely made a pretense of moving into the fire . A group of squaws began to chant to the accompaniment of the drums , and he judged by the words of their song that by this act the bridegroom was presumed to have cleansed himself of all evil . Three elders then approached him and requested him to remove hisp118helmet . Scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smeared his forehead and cheeks with streaks of green paint , the symbol of fertility , and the rhythm of the drums became faster , more insistent . Two warriors dragged a captive wild boar into the clearing , and Opachisco , again whispering instructions , told the bridegroom to slit the animal 's throat with his own knife . Smith , disgusted by the barbarous ceremony , quickly drew his sword and put the animal out of its misery . But the worst was yet to come , and Opachisco , catching some of the beast 's blood in a gourd , handed the cup to Smith . The Englishman lowered his head as he lifted the cup to his lips , so no one could see that he was not actually drinking , and he conquered his feeling of revulsion only by exerting so much self-control that he failed to hear the chant and thereforedid not learn the meaning of this portion of the ceremony . When be wrote his authoritative account of Indian weddings , he thought , he would need to fill in the gap with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squaws who had been keeping watch over Pocahontas filed out of the tent in the center of the clearing ; walking quickly and silently to Smith , they surrounded him and led him to the far side of the field , where , he gathered , he was now to play the part of a spectator for a time . All of the Chickahominy , men and women alike , joined wholeheartedly in a new chant , and Ru-Sa , enjoying the moment of the greatest grandeur she had ever known , stood in the entrance and then moved slowly into the clearing . Clusters of small inedible orange berries , which the Jamestown settlers called ornate , after the Spanish fashion , studded her headband , and although she would no longer serve as custodian to Powhatan 's daughter , she would be entitled to wear similarwild berries in her hair for the rest of her days in recognition of her services . The drums fell silent , abruptly and simultaneously , and in the hush that followed Pocahontas stepped into the open . She halted and , looking neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long moment . According to tradition , this was the one hour in her life when the attention of everyone was centered on her ; after she became a squaw , she would be expected to retire into the background and remain there unobtrusively . The Chickahominy looked at her in admiration and smiled approvingly ; now , as always , she fitted the role she had been called on to play . Many of the visiting chiefs , seeing her for the first time , gaped at her openly and murmured to each other that the lavish songs of praise that had been sung in her honor these past few nights had failed to do justice top119her . Even John Smith stared at her and for an instant he forgot that the whole marriage ceremony was a purposeless farce . She looked fresh and young , altogether desirable , but there was strength in her eyes and the way she held her head , dignity in her bearing . Everyone who saw her was aware of her fragile , feminine loveliness , but the more discerning knew there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She certainly realized she was attractive , but she took her charm for granted , neither flaunting it nor behaving with false modesty , and the dominion she exercised over the assemblage came from an inner sense of grace , a conviction that the unprecedentedstep she was taking in becoming the squaw of a **31;317;TOOLONG right . Her certainty conveyed itself to every personpresent , and the people rejoiced with her . Only Smith felt uneasy . Pocahontas was wearing moccasins of pale kidskin and a simple , kneelengthtunic similar to that of the other women , but at the neck in front a silver crescent was painted on the leather . A symbol of the new moon , it meant that she was embarking on a venture for which all of her previouslife had been a preparation . The white feathers were sewn to a buckskin headband that curved down over her head , covered her ears , and fell over the front of her tunic . A yellow-lined robe of white rabbit fur hung from her shoulders , and the early autumn breeze ruffled the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt in her , beckoned to her , and Pocahontas walked toward him , her step sedate and her eyes grave . She had imagined that she would hate this moment , for the white headdress on which she had labored so long and hard gave testimony to a lie , but now that she was actually participating in the ceremony , nothing mattered to her except that she and John Smith were being joined in marriage at last . She halted and , crossing her hands over her breasts , bowed three times , first to Powhatan , then to her brother , and finally to Smith . She was so pleased to see that Smith 's face had filled out in the two weeks since they had parted that she could not maintain the air of solemnity that was expected of her . She smiled , and the people , who would have been horrified if another girl had violated custom so flagrantly , laughed and nodded . Several of the guests glanced at Powhatan to see if he was angry , but he , too , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes she could do no wrong . Pocahontas removed her cloak and handed it to Opachisco , who moved off , leaving her alone . The drums began to tap again , very rapidly butp120softly , and thirty dancers pranced out into the clearing . Some carried spears , others brandished knives , and one tall warrior held aloft a large round stone painted yellow . All wore short , multifeathered aprons or skirts over their loincloths , and the upper portions of their bodies had been smeared with a glistening oil . Their faces were hidden behind large masks , two or three times the size of real faces , which were made of cornhusks stiffened and held together with a thick fish paste and then carefully painted . No two were the same , but there were many similarities ; the eyes of each were exaggerated , and regardless of whether the images were laughing or scowling , expressing fear or serenity , all were grotesque . The drums suggested abandon now , and the dancers formed in a tight circle around the motionless Pocahontas , whirling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the spectators , intoxicated by the beat of the drums , began to sway too . Occasionally one or another of the dancers left the ring , approached Pocahontas , and waved his arms energetically as he leaped and pirouetted close to her . Some seemed to threaten her , others demonstrated passion , and two or three , whose acting ability was limited , merely leaped around in a frenzy . The dancers occasionally twirled and spun so near to Pocahontas that she could feel the heat of their bodies , but none of them actually touched her , which was a remarkable tribute to their skill . They were presumably tempting her , warning her , and frightening her , and the crowd watched her closely to see if she responded to any of the dancers ' movements . A bride who either shrank from one of the masked figures or involuntarily joined in the dance was believed to be doomed to spend her days in misery . But Pocahontas remained immobile even when one of the prancingwarriors seemed about to crash into her ; the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums , marveled at her ability to stand as still as the carved poles they planted upright in the fields to curry the favor of the harvest gods . They agreed that no bride had ever shown such superb self-control and they felt certain that every sign pointed to a long and successful marriage . The dancers did not stop until they were exhausted , and even when they were gasping for breath they did not halt , and the drums urged them to expend even greater effort . Finally they limped from the clearing , and although the drummers fell silent , the echo of a throbbing rhythm seemed to reverberate from the hills . The squaws who surrounded Smith moved forward with him , and Pocahontas , turning slowly , walked into the tent . She reappeared in a moment , carrying a small clay bowlp121which she held before her in both her hands . The squaws stepped aside , and the bride and groom stood face to face for the first time . " Eat that which she who will now become the squaw of the mighty warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stilted voice . " Then tell her if he finds it good . " Dropping to her knees in the prescribed manner , she extended the bowl to him . To her consternation , Smith picked a large chunk of meat from the dish , and she realized he did not know he was expected to take only a token bite of the food . A variety of bitter herbs had been cooked with the meat , and a pinch of earth from each of the seven hills of the town had been thrown into the pot , together with a scoop of mud from the river . The dish was inedible , and Pocahontas , who was not allowed to speak any words other than those required in the ceremony , tried desperately to warn Smith with her eyes . He thought her expression was strained , but he did not understand it and popped the piece of meat into his mouth . Never had he tasted anything so peppery and sour , and when he made an effort to chew the meat , sand gritted against his teeth . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he did his act would be misinterpretedby the savages and would cause numerous complications . So he closed his eyes for a moment , shuddered , and swallowed ; Pocahontas was looking up at him in sympathy and concern , and when he glared at her he remembered that he had to respond to her formal entreaty . " It is good , " he said hoarsely . She continued to kneel and held the bowl closer ; now it was her turn to taste the dish , symbolically accepting the food he chose to leave . Accordingto the traditions of the ceremony , a squaw helped herself to an amount equal to that her bridegroom had consumed , so Pocahontas bravely selected a large square of meat and placed it in her mouth . Tears came to her eyes , and for a moment the crowd thought she was going to choke . A murmur of alarm swept through the assemblage , for this was the first omen that was other than propitious , and the people were fearfuluntil she caught her breath . Then she stood again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and the crowd sighed in relief . The inside of her mouth was burning , and she knew Smith felt the same ; glancing up at him , she could not resist smiling impishly , and to her delight he grinned at her in return . She forgot her discomfort and , touching him lightly on the arm to indicatethe next step in the proceedings , she walked at his side to the base of the rock.  |p122Powhatan  now took a direct part in the ceremony , and moving with deliberate majesty down the slope , he stood before the couple . To Smith 's astonishment he began to sing in a deep , croaking voice and apparently he spoke in the archaic tongue of his ancestors , for the Englishmanwas unable to comprehend more than an odd word here and there in his long , seemingly rambling recital . After a time he lowered his voice , and his final words were a soft mumble that no one could hear . Then he drew a new knife with a carved bone handle from beneath his gaudy robe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith did the same . The Chief of Chiefs took hold of his daughter 's index finger , and with a touch that was surprisingly gentle , he inflicted a tiny cut in the tip . Then he grasped Smith 's hand and jabbed the knife into his finger far more vigorously than was necessary to draw blood . The bride reached up and placed her finger against Smith 's lips , so he did the same to her in return . He realized that this was a climactic moment , for her eyes were starry , reminding him of the expressions he had seen in the faces of many women when they had looked at him . Then the crowd cheered , and one phase of the ceremony was at an end . Pocahontas nodded almost imperceptibly in the direction of the tent , and Smith started toward it ; she fell in behind him , her arms folded and her head lowered modestly . He hesitated at the entrance , but she whisperedsomething to him , so he walked inside , and she followed him as the crowd started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were alone in the semidark , isolated from the savages outside . The girl sighed , removed her white headdress , and threw it venomously into a corner . " Now I will never again wear the band of a maiden , " she said , as much to herself as to him . " I have lived a lie for the last time . " He stared at her and then gazed around the tent . A fresh bed of young , soft boughs stood in the center , but all other signs of habitation had been removed , and the ground had been swept until all traces of dust had disappeared . Gradually it dawned on him that he and Pocahontas were now expected to consummate the marriage , and he took a single step toward her . " Are you now my wife ? " he asked . " I am . " Her tone was proud , but her voice trembled slightly . Smith smiled and tried to draw her to him , but she held him off and he frowned . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pocahontas made no reply . " Tell me why you threw off your headband , " he persisted . She drew a deep breath , lifted her head , and held herself erect . " Ip123ca n't pretend to you , " she said in English . " You 've guessed correctly . " Satisfied , he placed his hands around her waist . " This is the first part of the ceremony that makes sense . " " No ! " Pocahontas broke away from him and retreated to a far corner of the tent . Puzzled and angry , he followed her . " Why not ? " " I am the wife of a Christian , " she said with unaffected candor . " If I had married a chief of my own people , I would have followed his customs . But I have read much of husbands and wives in the Bible , and you surely feel , as I do , that it is wrong for us to be together in this way . I intend to live like a Christian , so I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped short and lost his desire for her . Her resolve to behave like a Christian reminded him of the possibility that she might request another wedding ceremony in the Jamestown church , so he sat down on the bed and nodded . This was certainly not the time to insist that she honor his conjugal rights . " I agree , " he said mildly . Pocahontas felt ashamed of herself ; he was not an unthinking , unfeelingbrute like most of the men she had ever known , and she had done him a grave injustice by arbitrarily assuming that he was insensitive . She should have known that he would feel precisely as she did , and she realized that one of the reasons she loved him was because he possessed the uncanny ability to discern her innermost thoughts , which were almost invariably identical with his own . She sat down beside him , slipped her hand into his , and feeling a sense of complete fulfillment , she waited with him , satisfied and at peace , until the raucous , ribald chants of her people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they emerged into the open again , the wedding guests were ravenous , and the men marched in a triumphal procession to the feast that had been prepared for them . Pocahontas dutifully retired to her own house to await her husband , and the other women scattered to their huts . The meal that the Chickahominy warriors and their guests ate was superb , the oratory that followed was less dull and boring than usual , and the dances that ended the evening 's entertainment were lively . The braves had rarely enjoyed a merrier evening or pleasanter companionship , and when they finally went off to their own homes they were of one mind : this had been the most delightful wedding feast they had ever attended . Smith smelled of venison and smoked fish and tobacco , and when he walked into Pocahontas 's little house the room seemed to become filled with the odors . But she did not mind , and when she greeted him in thep124dark , there was no need for words between them . Her husband had come to her at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she needed . They moved silently into each other 's arms , and for the first time they slept together . The next two weeks passed quickly , and Smith spent one of the most carefree periods he had ever known . He made love to Pocahontas whenever he wished , he slept long hours , and , unburdened by responsibilities of any sort , he allowed her to wait on him , cook for him , and amuse him . But gradually the novelty of their relationship waned , and little by little he felt a return of his restless desire to achieve what lesser men could not accomplish . His place was in Jamestown , and there was no longer any necessity for him to remain in the land of the Chickahominy . The braves who had guarded him so assiduously had been dismissed on his wedding day , and he assumed he was free to come and go as he pleased now , but he took no chances and first went to Powhatan to discuss the future . Having learned something of Indian ways , it did not cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was settled . The Chief of Chiefs proved to be surprisingly amenable and readily agreed that Smith 's duty required him to return to his own tribe immediately . Actually , Powhatan was relieved to be rid of him and made no secret of his feelings . Smith apprehensively broached his plan to leave Pocahontas behind and launched into a long , involved explanation of his motives , but the bride 's father cut him off . It was enough , he said , that Smith intended to send for her later ; what was more , a man was privilegedto treat his wife as he saw fit . Powhatan was secretly relieved , for he had been quietly grieving at the prospect of losing Pocahontas to the Jamestown settlers , and he was happy to approve any scheme that would keep her near him for a longer time . He put no obstacles in his son-in-law 's way and offered to provide an escort for the journey to the seacoast , but Smith had spent too many weeks being watched by alert Chickahominy braves and refused . Powhataninsisted on showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birchbark canoe . It would be stocked with provisions for the trip , he said , and would be ready early the following morning . Pocahontas was surprised when her husband arose at dawn the next day , but she hurried out to prepare a breakfast of broiled fish , pulse , and corn boiled in goat 's milk for him . When she returned to the hut she felt a twinge of uneasiness when she saw that he had packed his few belongingsinto a blanket . She was speechless , and when he glanced at her and through her , her misgivings increased , for his expression wasP125that of a stranger who did not care if he never set eyes on her again . " I did n't know you were going hunting , " she said calmly , concealing her worry . Smith 's tone when he replied was so casual and offhand that her fears became more intense . " I 'm returning to Jamestown today , " he declared . Pocahontas felt as though she were stifling . " I 'll get ready immediately . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel of his pistol , which Powhatan had thoughtfully returned to him . Her legs shook , so she sat and pretended to adjust her new headband studded with the tiny fresh green leaves that only married women were entitled to wear . " Oh ? Is n't this a rather sudden decision ? " " Not really . I 've discussed it with your father , " he said with subtle emphasis , " and we 're in complete accord . Surely you can understand that my place is with the colonists . Do n't forget that I 'm president of the Council and that I have a responsibility to the settlers . " " Of course . " She told herself this was not a moment to stand on ceremonyand behave like the stiff-backed daughter of a great chief , so she swallowed her pride . " What about me ? " She tried to sound selfpossessed , but in spite of her best efforts her voice trembled . He laughed without conviction and , planting himself firmly in front of her , took hold of her hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he smiled at her , shaking his head . " I thought you knew me better than that . Do you suppose for one instant that I 'm going to forget you ? " " Well , I --  No . " " All right , then . You 'll have to show a little faith in me , that 's all there is to it . " He gazed at her whimsically , and she looked so forlorn that for a moment he actually felt a measure of compassion for her . " You do trust me , do n't you ? " " I married you , John Smith , " Pocahontas said simply , and wanted to cry because she felt so safe and secure when he held her in his arms . " If you 'll stop to consider my situation , you 'll realize I 'm faced with a very delicate problem . " Pocahontas 's mind was spinning , and she was unable to think clearly . " What problem ? " " Suppose I had been an ordinary man . A carpenter or a stonemason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry me ? Certainlynot . The daughter of Powhatan could only marry a chief . " He released her and shrugged , his attitude indicating that he was **26;350;TOOLONG patience . " As president of the Council , I have a position to maintain too . My people expect me to marry an Englishp126duchess , I 'm sure . " He glanced at her obliquely , and when she seemed to accept his statement without question , he decided to embellish it for good measure . " Or , at the very least , a man of my rank is supposed to take a French princess or a Spanish infanta as his wife . Not that you 're inferior to the greatest ladies in Europe , of course . If I did n't think highly of you , I would n't have married you , would I ? " " No , I suppose not , " Pocahontas said dubiously . She felt that something in his argument failed to ring true but could n't put her finger on the error . " The English are new to America , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to educate them and teach them many things about you , just as I 've taught you much about my country and our customs there . I 've got to tell them about you bit by bit , so that when they learn you and I are married , they 'll rejoice with us . You 'll remain here until everything is arranged . Then I 'll send for you . " The question was settled in his mind , and after kissing her absently , he sat down and began to eat his breakfast rapidly . Pocahontas , watching him , had no appetite and she could not rid herself of the unreasonablebut terrible dread that he was leaving her for all time.  |p127The  sentries in the palisades tower overlooking the James River blinked in amazement , thought of sounding an alarm , and finally compromised by summoning both the captain and sergeant of the guard . Never in Jamestown 's brief history had sober , sane Englishmen seen anyonelike the man who was drifting down the river in a low-slung birchbark canoe with a distinctive Chickahominy curved prow . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an Indian , but he wore a steel corselet , wool breeches , and leather boots ; he carried a sword , and a steel helmet was perched on the back of his head . In it he wore a cluster of feathers , however , and the paddle he occasionally dipped into the water was carved with a variety of native figures . He was singing , too , and what confused the sentries was that he chanted a repetitive , monotonous tune in the language of the Naturals . When he drew closer , the men in the tower saw that he carried a pistol in his belt , and they trained their muskets on him , as it was safer to take no chances . Then he lifted his head , waved genially , and shouted the password that several of the sentries remembered had been used sometimeduring the summer months . Their suspicions increased , and the atmosphere in the tower became tense until the sergeant laughed exuberantly . " It 's Captain Smith ! " he cried . The gates were thrown open , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen , while others ran into the town with the good news . When he guided his craft to the shore , eager hands pulled the canoe onto dry land , and Smith was lifted out bodily . Everyone present insisted on shaking his hand , and so many voices were raised simulta/neously that no one could hear a word he said . But that was unimportant ; what mattered was that he was alive and had come home , and the receptionhe received was even more enthusiastic than he had anticipated . He protested halfheartedly when two of the men hoisted him onto their shoulders , but he graciously consented to permit his escort to parade with him into the town . Two or three dozen colonists ran toward him from every direction as his bearers marched through the gates , and he replied heartily to their ecstatic greetings . The parade quickly became a triumphal procession , but Smith , even though enjoying the tribute to his popularity , could not help observing the changes that had taken place in the community . The first thing that struck him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking disrepair , a condition that he would not have permitted to exist and that he would need to rectify immediately . Many of the poles in the palisades had been cut from young saplings of green wood which had become warped , and the spaces between them were wide enough for an Indian warrior to wriggle through . At the moment , therefore , the protectionthat the wall afforded Jamestown was negligible . There were numerous strange faces in the crowds that appeared , and unlike the people whom Smith knew , these outsiders did not join in the procession but gaped at him silently . He realized at once that a new company of settlers had arrived and he studied the recruits with interest . They were pale , he thought , their faces were pinched , and if he was any judge they were unhappy . The reasons for their discontent became apparent to him shortly , when the paraders turned down a road that had been built since he had left in August . The lane itself was in a disgracefulcondition , he saw , and the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep holes and ruts made walking dangerous , the underbrush had not been cleared away from the sides of the path , and several tree stumps , which should have been uprooted , continued to stand and impeded both carts and pedestrians . The road , unimportant in itself , was a symbol of Jamestown 's degeneration , and Smith became increasingly angry as he looked around . The huts that had been built to provide shelter for the new members of the colony could not be dignified by calling them homes , and he thought that not even the Chickahominy savages forced their slaves to live in such miserable dwellings . The huts were made of mud , here and there haphazardly strengthened by twigs and branches ; they were without windows , no doors blocked their crude yawning entrance frames , and they had patently been constructed by men who had not bothered top129take the comfort or convenience of the inhabitants into consideration , for most of them were so low that no adult man could stand erect inside them . Worst of all , these pitiful little buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season the water stood only a few feet from half a dozen of the houses . Before Smith had departed on his unavoidably prolonged trip of explorationhe had given orders to have the bog filled in and had specificallyinstructed the Council to permit no construction in the area until the land was dry . Someone had deliberately chosen to disobey his orders , and he silently cursed the stupidity of his colleagues . He would need to take immediate steps to build new homes for the recently arrived settlersand to tear down the huts . If people were still living in them when the spring rains came , half the community would fall ill , and there was even a possibility that an epidemic of the Black Death or some other dreadful affliction might strike the people . Two or three of the larger warehouses were off to the left , and Smith made a mental note to inspect them today at his first opportunity . He dreaded the prospect , as it seemed likely to him that the supplies he had accumulated in his trades with the natives had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town were any criterion , that would be the situation . And he had no idea where he could secure any considerable quantities of corn and meat in the near future ; only the Chickahominy owned enough foodstuffs to take care of Jamestown'sneeds , and it would be impossible for him to deal with Powhatan in the months to come . He could afford to take no chances that Pocahontas might attach herself to him again , and he had decided that the best way to avoid her would be to maintain a safe distance between himself and all members of her tribe . It was sufficiently unpleasant to contemplate the possibility that she might simply appear at the gates of the colony someday , claiming to be his wife . However , he was prepared to face that eventuality if and when it arose , and in the meantime he had no intention of borrowing trouble . Matters of real significance were on his mind , and he dismissed his vague concern that Pocahontas might someday make an attempt to embarrass him . The marchers seemed to be parading aimlessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked his bearers to take him to the house he had occupied before he had gone off to the land of the Potomac . They shouted to him that it was now the home of a gentleman who had arrived with the new settlers , so he requested them to carryp130him instead to the headquarters of the colonial government , which had been under construction when he left . The two-story structure , painted white with real glass in its windows , stood on the south side of the parade ground , and two sentries , stationed in front of the main entrance , paced up and down with more vigor than guards usually showed , for it was a chilly morning . As the procession crossed the parade ground a number of men hurried out of the building , hastily donning their cloaks , and Smith recognized his Council associates , who looked older and frailer than he had remembered them . The last to appear was Captain Gabriel Archer , who gave orders to one of the sentries and then stood apart until a platoon of militiamen appeared from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels he approached the celebrants , and Smith was startled to see that he was wearing the broad , watered-silk red sash that was the badge of the presidency . Archer was glowering , and Smith 's sense of well-being began to fade . The gentlemen of the Council remained huddled near the door , but Archer , followed by the militiamen , moved out onto the parade ground , and the cheering settlers gradually fell silent . Smith 's bearers , still carryinghim on their shoulders , edged forward with him until he and his old enemy were only a few feet apart , and it suddenly occurred to Smith that in the pleasure of returning to Jamestown he had all but forgotten Archer 's existence . " You 're back . " It was remarkable how Archer could insinuate sly and vicious meanings into the simplest words . " I am , " Smith replied calmly . He wanted to shake hands with his other colleagues , but he was surprised to see that all of them , even MatthewScrivener , were staring at him glumly . Never , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be greeted with such apathy by his equals . " What have you to say for yourself ? I warn you that every word you speak is being recorded . " Archer held himself arrogantly , his left hand on the hilt of his sword . Smith tapped his bearers on the shoulders , and when they released him , he jumped to the ground . Sauntering forward , he halted directly in front of Archer and then half turned so the whole crowd could hear him . " I do n't know what sort of records you 've been keeping , my good man , " he said clearly and loudly , " but you may write in letters of fire that no one has ever been happier than I am to come home . " He grinned and , as he expected , the settlers nodded and smiled approvingly.  | " We certainly did n't expect to see you again . " There was something so ugly in Archer 's tone that Smith bristled . " It was one of my fondest hopes that you 'd gone back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence here can ruin my happiness . My friends , " he continued , stepping away from his old adversary and including the councilmen and the people in a sweeping gesture , " I ca n't begin to tell you how glad I am to see you . " " Here , now , " Archer said , catching hold of his arm , " you 'll make no speeches . " The man 's effrontery was colossal , but Smith wanted no fight to mar his homecoming . Many in the crowd were newcomers who did n't know him , and they would be less than favorably impressed with him if he allowed himself to become embroiled in an argument . So he smiled jovially , and when he spoke he actually managed to sound convincing . " Apparently you have substituted for me during my absence , Captain Archer , so I suppose I must extend my thanks to you , both for myself and for the people . " He paused , and his voice became a shade harder . " As I 'm here now , I intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll thank you to return my sash of office to me . " Archer 's hollow laugh was condescending . " You were impeached and deposed many weeks ago . I now have the honor to have assumed the presidency . " Something in the stillness of the spectators made Smith uneasy , but he could not believe he had really been impeached . He glanced at the members of the Council , and his sense of bewilderment increased . Those who once had been friendly to him were gazing down at the ground , unable to meet his eyes , and others , like Christopher Newport , made no effort to conceal their bitter hostility to him . " May I be permitted to know on what grounds I have been impeached ? " he asked , keeping his temper for the sake of the people , who were his real source of power . " Your impeachment , my dear Smith , is the very least of your worries . " Archer smiled loftily , shrugged , and snapped his fingers at the sergeant in command of the militiamen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Grand Council of Jamestown in the London Company 's Colony of Virginia , I order you to arrest John Smith , who is sometimes pleased to use the title of Captain . " Before the startled Smith could speak , the pikemen moved forward , and two of them caught hold of his arms . His right hand darted to the hilt of his sword but dropped again when he realized that armed re/sistance would merely complicate his situation . He turned in appeal to the settlers but discovered that the rest of the platoon had formed in a semicircle behind him , effectively cutting him off from the people . The cause of his arrest , whatever it might be , was necessarily absurd , and the men and women of Jamestown certainly knew he was innocent of all wrongdoing . He could see that the colonists sympathized with him , but they remained silent , and gradually he realized they were not the same people they had been when he had left in August . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives for themselves , and although they had always been properly respectful to their superiors , the common dangers and hardships that all shared alike in the New World had broken down the formal barriers that usually separated the gentry and common men . But now the settlers were obviously cowed , and none of them dared approach the pikemen , who themselves seemed to be none too happy with the task that had been assigned to them . Several men and women in the crowd , artisans whom Smith had befriended and housewives whom he had helped , muttered to each other and to their neighbors angrily , but when Archer walked to one end of the row of militiamen and stood gazing out at them , his hands on his hips , they stopped speaking , hung their heads , and shuffled their feet . The colony was surely doomed , Smith thought ; no venture could succeed when the people were ruled by fear . Jamestown was the cornerstone of his future fame , and he was outragedby all that had been mishandled in the few months he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been destroyed by stupid men to whom high office meant the exercise of power for its own sake rather than an opportunity to create constructively . For a moment his anger blinded him to the urgency of his immediate , personal problem , but the presence of the pikemen on either side of him reminded him that he could do nothing for the colony and thus make his place in history secure until he disposed of the ridiculous matter of his arrest . Twisting around in the grasp of the militiamen , he faced Captain Archer proudly . " I demand to know the charge against me , " he said in a hard , cold voice . Archer 's eyelids drooped , but he could not conceal his elation ; this was a moment he had been anticipating with relish for a long time . " You have been judged responsible for the death of Master Curtis Watkins , " he said . Smith , remembering the luckless youth who had been murdered byp133the Chickahominy in the Potomac hunting preserve , was too stunned to reply , and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was dreaming , but the solemn faces of the councilmen , the somber , fearful glances that the settlers exchanged , convinced him that Archer was serious . " That 's nonsense , " he said at last . The new president of the Council stood on sure ground and smiled contemptuously . " Really ? It 's too bad you were n't here to defend yourselfat your trial . Naturally your guilt made you afraid to return here for it . " " My trial ? " Smith asked incredulously . " You were tried during the period of your desertion , naturally . " Archer spoke as though his mock serenity would dissolve were he a less patient and judicious man . " And by a unanimous vote of the judges , your peers , you were found guilty . " He nodded faintly in the direction of Newport , Edward Wingfield , and John Kendall , and his attitude made it plain that he , too , had acted as a judge . Smith 's temper became frayed . " Then I demand a new trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men who accompanied me into the wilderness be heard as witnesses . " Archer sighed . " They have already testified against you , my dear Smith . " " I do n't believe it . " " Believe what you please , it wo n't alter the truth . Oh , they tried to defend you at first . " Archer 's eyes became narrow , and through some sort of optical illusion his lips looked thin and pale . " You had done your best to confuse them , but a few weeks on a diet of stale bread and a lusty beating or two did wonders for them and straightened them out . " Smith clenched his fists and would have thrown himself at Archer had the pikemen not restrained him . His faithful companions , weakenedby their whipping at the hands of the Chickahominy , had been tortured until they had given the evidence that Archer wanted , and everyone present knew it . The cynical gentlemen of the Council , in spite of their fine clothes and lofty airs , their ability to discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sir Francis Bacon , were savages as primitive as the Naturals . No , they were even more contemptible , for their education and exposure to the most advancedcivilization ever created by man should have made them somewhatsuperior to animals . But it would be useless to reprimand them , and Smith merely glanced at them scornfully.  | " Your crude travesty on justice does not amuse me , Archer , " he said harshly . " I 'm sure it does n't . But you 'll be even less amused to learn that you 've been sentenced to death . Gentlemen are permitted to die by the ax , but common criminals are hung , and as you 're a rogue with no background other than that which you 've woven out of your own imagination , you 'll hang . " Turning back to the spectators , Captain Archer raised his voice and spoke more sternly . " Anyone who disturbs the peace by creating a public nuisance or demonstrating in favor of a convicted rogue will be punished severely . " Somewhere in the distance a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated clearly across the silent parade ground . Men stared sullenly at the new president , matching his contempt with open surly hatred . Independent , free Englishmen were being deprived of their precious liberties , and rebellion was in the air . Archer , afraid that a few inflammatory words from Smith would start a riot , obviously realized he would be courting disaster if he allowed his enemy to speak again . There would be time to gloat later , after the crowd had disbanded and its champion had been rendered harmless . " Remove the prisoner , " he told the sergeant in charge of the militia . The pikemen formed a cordon around Smith and quickly marched him off to the prison that he himself had built . To the disappointment of the people he allowed himself to be led away quietly , but he knew , as they did not , that if he incited a revolt , Archer and the other members of the Council would have a legitimate grievance against him and send a report to the London Company that might permanently damage his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt confident that eventually Archer would be made to appear ridiculous for having lodged such a flimsy complaint against him . Similarly , he was not afraid that the death sentence would be carried out , as he knew enough of the law to realize that a trial conducted during his absence was illegal . He would therefore prepare an appeal to the Lord Chief Justice in London , and Archer , whose lack of inner security made him afraid of his superiors in England , would not dare to execute a rival whose ghost could rise up in the courts and cause him to lose his own head . For the present , then , Smith counseled himself to be patient and not lose either his sense of perspective or his temper . The colony was disintegratingin the hands of men who had already amply illustrated their abysmal ignorance of the art of governing , and when conditions became intolerable , the settlers would demand the release and restorationp135to office of the one leader who could save Jamestown from self-destruction . In the meantime , Smith thought , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he prepared his appeal and made certain that the next ship 's captain who came here from England receivedit , he would devote his full time and energy to the writing of his history of Virginia . In many ways , he reflected , his situation was similar to that of Sir Walter Raleigh , who was sympathetically regarded as something of a martyr by most people and who would be remembered long after the King who had unjustly imprisoned him was forgotten , principally because the surest way to achieve immortality was to perform brave deeds and then record them for posterity in book form . Smith had not read even a small part of Sir Walter 's manuscript but was willing to wager that a man as wise in the ways of the world as Raleigh would not neglect to describe his own exploits in detail . It was pleasant to reflect that he and his distinguished colleague were being subjected to similar , preposterous treatment and therefore would be coupled in the minds of future generations , but in one respect their circumstances were vastly different . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London suite that had once been occupied by Mary , Queen of Scots , but the hovel to which Smith was being conductedwas a miserable habitation whose previous tenants had been the ancestors of the rats who now lived there . The prison was a one-story stone building , its ugly , squat appearance relieved only by a thatched roof . There were two cells in the jail , the larger of them a square , bleak room that was used to house thieves , robbers , adulterers , and wife beaters , misguided but harmless men who had committed minor infractions of the law but were not considered real criminals . The smaller , with bars of precious iron set in the stone frame of its single tiny window , was reserved for debtors , blasphemers , and others who had perpetrated serious offenses against society . As Smith rightly guessed , he was taken to the less desirable cell , but he accepted his lot so cheerfully that the militiamenfelt impelled to apologize profusely to him before locking the door behind him . He felt a trifle sorry for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he did , that each day he spent here the popular sentiment in his favor would mount higher and that when he was finally returned to power his control over the destiny of the colony would be all the more absolute.  |p136One  of Powhatan 's wives sat in a far corner of his private sleeping lodge , chopping nuts , which she would later mix with dried plums to make the confection he enjoyed more than any other food . A glowing fire burning in a pit in the center of the room made the hut comfortable , and a thin plume of smoke drifted lazily through a hole in the roof . The Chief of Chiefs ' second wife crouched near the entrance , where the light was stronger , patiently rubbing grease into one of her master 's new winter robes of buffalo skin to make it pliable . As always , it was very quiet in the lodge , and when Powhatan arrived home the women neither looked up from their work nor addressed him ; he would recognize their presence if and when it pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deigned to become aware of them , they would remain silent , after the fashion of docile , obedient squaws . All women possess the ability to express themselves without words , however , and the moment Powhatan raised the flap and walked in he realized they were disturbed . There had been no quarrel between them , he knew , as neither had been crying , and no fresh fingernail marks marred their faces . He had warned them he would whip both of them if they fought and , knowing he was a man of his word , they had taken his threat seriously , which pleased him . Nevertheless , he could see at a glance that their backs were rigid , their features stiff , and their manner strained as they worked mechanically , not really thinking about their tasks . The cause of their disapproval sat cross-legged before the fire , warmingherself , and Powhatan , who was tired after a long day in council with his elders , felt his weariness disappear . It was no wonder that his wives were upset , for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter a warrior 's home without an express invitation , and the Chief of Chiefs always insisted that traditions be observed to the letter in his own dwelling . Even Opachisco never came here unless he had been summoned , and when he wanted to see his father he went instead to the large hut , a stone 's throw away , in which Powhatan conducted his business . But Pocahontas had always ignored practices which she found inconvenient , yet she never seemed to take advantage of her unique position , for she unquestioningly accepted her father 's special favor as her right . Powhatan knew he should have dealt with her more severely when she was younger and should have insisted that Ru-Sa rule her more strictly , but it was too late now to change her lifelong habits . If he reprimanded her for coming here unbidden , she would be hurt , and then he wouldp137blame himself ; besides , he felt precisely as he had when she was a little girl . He was so pleased to see her that nothing else mattered . She bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown of her head , her hair held in place neatly with a band of green leaves , and he addressed her hurriedly so she could raise her face . " Powhatan greets his daughter , " he said , and when she looked up he was dismayed to see that her smile was forced and that there were deep circles under her eyes . " I will speak alone with my daughter , " he told his wives . The older women immediately stopped working , wrapped themselves in bearskin robes , and walked out into the cold , where they would remainuntil he gave them permission to return . They had been afraid he would indulge the girl again but had been unable to resist hoping that just this once he would put her in her place , and as they left one of them could not resist the temptation to express her opinion of his disgustingly indulgent attitude by sniffing audibly . Powhatan stared after them for a moment , trying to decide which of them had dared to criticize him , but he could settle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was far more important to learn why Pocahontas had come to see him . The front of her robe was open , and he saw that her neck and shouldersabove the top of her tunic looked painfully thin . Picking up a clay bowl of the nut and dried plum confection , he sat down beside her and offered her a sweetmeat . Again she smiled but shook her head . " You have eaten today ? " he asked . " I have eaten , " Pocahontas replied dutifully . " Then you have eaten too little . " " It is winter , " she said . Powhatan was always confused when he tried to understand feminine logic , but his long years of marriage to five wives had taught him patience . " It is winter , " he agreed . " There is snow upon the ground . " " Even the thickest pine trees in the forest are thin . " Her manner indicated that she had offered him an irrefutable argument and that in her opinion the subject was closed . Had she been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most subtle and cunning of his sons . Knowing her , he realized there was only one way to deal with her and he dropped all pretense . " The daughter of Powhatanis unhappy , " he declared bluntly . Pocahontas had never lied to him . " I am unhappy , " she said calmly . There was a silence , and he picked up one of the sweetmeats , ate itreflectively , and waited for her to continue . In his negotiations with thep138rulers of other nations he could sit , unmoving and infinitely patient , for long periods and thus force others to speak their minds without revealing his own thoughts . But he always suffered sharp pains in his middle when his daughter used his own tactics in her dealings with him , and he began to tap his fingertips on the edge of the bowl . She sensed his restlessness , took a deep breath , and shifted her positionslightly so she faced him . She had come here seeking his help and she told herself that her reluctance to speak was stupid , yet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that she was being disloyal to her husband . " More than a full moon 's time has passed since John Smith returned to his own people , " she said at last . Powhatan stared hard at her . " You are going to bear him a son ? " " No , " she replied wistfully . " If that had happened , then it might be that he would welcome me . More than half a moon ago I sent a message to John Smith . It was carried by a warrior of the Chesapeake tribe who was returning from the land of the Chickahominy to his own land . I wrote in John Smith 's tongue and I asked him to give me the right to join him . My place is at his side . " She straightened , and for the first time there was strength and determination in her voice . " I am his wife . " " But he forbids you to come to him ? " Powhatan demanded , his mind already sorting and weighing a variety of solutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride , and although she might have dissembled with others , she could not hide her raw emotions from her father . " Today another brave of the Chesapeake came here and brought word to me of what happened . The warrior who took my message to Jamestown waited for a day and a night , but John Smith has sent no message to me . He does not accept me and he does not reject me . He pretends I do not exist , just as a hunter ignores the snow and the rain when he is on the trail . " The bowl struck the ground with such force that bits of clay and chunks of the confection scattered in every direction . " Smith has shamed the daughter of Powhatan . He has also shamed the Chief of Chiefs and the Chickahominy nation . It is good that you have told me of this act of dishonor . " He folded his arms , stared into the fire , and after a moment 's silence he pronounced judgment in a low , hard voice . " John Smith will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , unable to speak . She had come to her father hoping he would find some way to reunite her with her husband , but he had completely misunderstood her desire . She wanted Smith , not revenge ; what was more , she had learned in the Biblep139that vengeance belonged to the God of the English , not to mere men . Powhatan softened and looked at the girl indulgently . " Squaws are weak , and warriors are strong , " he reminded her . " That is why men go to war and women stay at home . You have been the squaw of Smith , and so you are sad for him . But your heart will be light again when you hold his scalp in your hand . Powhatan , " he assured her , " will not let his daughter suffer . " " If John Smith dies , " she said slowly , " then I want to die too . " It was evident that she meant every word , and her father , who otherwisewould have insisted that his sentence be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the wampum and other wedding gifts you received where no one can find them , " he said , " otherwise the chiefs who gave them to you will want them back . I will go myself into the forests to hide your riches and will take with me only your brothers , whom we can trust . After your wealth has been buried , I will hold a ceremony and will end your marriage to Smith . When it is all done , " he added cheerfully , " we will give a special feast . " Pocahontas did n't know whether to laugh or cry . " I am the squaw of John Smith , " she said . " I want to be his squaw as long as I live ! " " I see . " Powhatan nodded and reflected that she might be right . All women were stubborn , of course , but Pocahontas 's insistence that Smith accept her as his wife could prove to be the best solution to an unpleasant problem . It was a husband 's right to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had availed himself of the privilege twice , he was in no position to criticize his son-in-law . It would be difficult to reconcile the murder of Smith with his own conscience , too , even though the Englishmanhad grossly insulted him by scorning his daughter . It would therefore be very convenient if Smith could be forced to take Pocahontas under his roof until she grew tired of him ; such an arrangement would save Powhatan considerable personal embarrassment and make it unnecessaryfor him to spend many moons propitiating the gods , which he would be required to do if he had the fair-skinned foreigner killed . Unfortunately , Smith was headstrong and canny and consequently would be impervious to ordinary persuasions . Pocahontas herself would be an unreliable ally in carrying out any scheme that might be developed , too , Powhatan decided as he looked at her strained , anxious face . Women in love , as he knew from personal experience , were undependable and flighty and frequently acted like their own worst enemies . Hence he would need to handle her with care . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodge of her husband , "  |p140he  said . " If he drives her away , then she knows he has grown tired of her , But John Smith might not beat his squaw or send her from him with curses . He might take her into his house . No one can read the heart of another , so no one can say what Smith might do . So the daughter of Powhatan might show wisdom if she goes to the town of her husband and stands at his door . " Pocahontas had often contemplated making such a journey , but each time the idea had occurred to her she had drawn back from it . " I could not , " she said . Her father gazed at her sternly . " You have too much pride . You forget you are only a woman . " She tossed her head angrily . " Because I am a woman I have only as much pride as my husband feels when he looks at me . When a woman gives herself to a man , he takes more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pride , and he may do with it as he pleases . If there is love for her in his heart , a new pride is born in her , a pride greater than any she has ever before known . But if he turns her away from his lodge , her pride becomes as nothing , like the pools of water that disappear in the heat of summer . I am not too proud to go to John Smith . I would go to him and throw myself at his feet , I would beg him to take me into his lodge , if I thought he would listen to me . But he has shown he would not . I would not care what others said about me . But I would feel great shame inside myself because John Smith found me unworthy and turned me away from his house . Then I would surely want to die . " It became increasingly clear to Powhatan that he would be required to take action on her behalf . " Pocahontas has spoken in a manner worthy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothingly . The problem had to be handled realistically , and the less she knew about his plans the less she would be able to interfere . " Go now , " he declared abruptly , " and return to your own house . But first go to Opachisco and tell him the father of all the Chickahominy will speak with him . " Pocahontas knew from his tone that he intended to offer her no explanation , but it was enough that he was going to help her and that he intended to take his eldest son into his confidence . She had to curb an impulse to kiss him , as no woman , not even the Chief of Chiefs ' daughter , had the right to embrace him unless he first indicated that he was willing to discard his dignity and permit such a familiarity . Happiness , relief , and gratitude were mirrored in her eyes as she jumped to her feet and bowed before him . The sense of depression and futility that had gripped her ever since John Smith had waved farewell to her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she ran lightly out into the late afternoon cold . Her father 's wives stood near the entrance , huddling in their bearskin robes and stamping their feet to keep warm , and she felt sorry for them . She would have asked them to visit her house and wait there until Powhatanfinished his conference , but she knew they hated her and would refuse . Yet she felt she had to make some gesture to them , as they were suffering from the cold on her account , so she bowed to them and was pleased to see their astonishment . She had paid them the highest of compliments , as it was unusual for one of royal blood to make a gesture of homage to women who were merely the squaws of a chief , and she understood their amazement . But she could not dwell on the matter , and after smiling fleetingly at them she hurried to the lodge of her brother and told him breathlessly that Powhatan had summoned him . Opachisco knew his sister was involved in some way , but he asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carving , he snatched his heaviest wolf skin robe from a wall peg and hurried to the top of the hill . He was vaguely aware of the presence of his stepmothers outside the house , but he did not bother to acknowledge their respectful greetings as he entered the lodge . His father was staring into the fire , absently picking up sweetmeat crumbs that were scattered on the floor and eating them , and Opachisco sat down beside him , folded his arms , and awaited Powhatan 's pleasure . The older man , wasting no time on greetings , began to speak ; he describedPocahontas 's situation , and Opachisco , listening intently , grew angry . He had always been fond of his sister . He had formed a poor opinion of Smith from the first , and he hoped he would be given a personaldirective to avenge the family honor . The winter was dull , so he would enjoy plunging a knife into Smith and bringing home a foreigner'sscalp lock as a souvenir . But he knew better than to interrupt and he remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . " Smith , King of James , " Powhatan said at last , " has a strong heart . But even the strongest of warriors can be ruled by fear . Remember that , my son , when I go to join my ancestors and you sit in my place . " " I hear the words of my father and I will remember them , " Opachisco replied automatically , and swallowed his disappointment . Obviously Smith would be allowed to live . " On the day that Smith ran the Race of the Damned , he showed he had no fear for himself . He is a true warrior , and this is good . But he isp142the chief of his people . He is responsible for them . So he must have fears for their safety . " Powhatan scratched himself absently and smiled . " An attack will be made on his town . Many of the fair-skinned men and their squaws will be killed . Smith has learned to read the sign talk of our people , so one warrior , who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not join in the fighting but will give to Smith a belt of wampum on which the emblem of Pocahontas will appear in beads . I will instruct Pocahontas herself to make the belt and to put her emblem on it . " His son found a sizable chunk of the nut and plum confection near his left foot and ate it . " I understand , " he said . " Then Smith will know that if he does not take Pocahontas into his lodge his town will be raided a second time and will be destroyed , and all of his people will die . Opachisco has heard the words of his father and finds them good . " Suddenly he straightened . " I ask for the right to lead the warriors who will raid the town of Smith , King of James . " Powhatan chuckled and shook his head , " Sometimes I am tired and wish to join my ancestors in the land of the gods . But I must remain here until my son learns he will not become a mighty chief until his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us if the Chickahominy raided the town of Smith . Ek might think we were seekingvengeance . The raid will be made by our cousins , the Rappahannock , who are true braves and will do as they are bidden . Besides , " he added , " many warriors will die in the fight . The Rappahannock have grown strong in the past few years , so strong they might someday challengeour rule over them . It will be good for the Chickahominy if some of the finest of Rappahannock warriors are killed . " Opachisco felt unbounded admiration for his father 's wisdom , but he saw one fault with the over-all plan . " In battle , " he said , " it is not always possible to know what will happen before it happens . We will tell the Rappahannock to spare the life of Smith , King of James . But if a warrior with the heat of war in his blood places his knife in the heart of Smith , what then ? " " Then , " Powhatan replied with a satisfied smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The all-seeing , who rule us from above , will know it was the Rappahannockwho killed Smith and will not punish the Chickahominy . And , " he said , " we will know that the all-wise gods have decided to solve the problem of Powhatan 's daughter by making her a widow . So either way she will be happy . "  |p143The  Susan Constant and her new sister ship , the Royal Hope , were anchored near the blockhouse , and each day Smith went to the window of his tiny cell to peer at the two vessels . Both of the captainshad been given copies of his appeal to the Lord Chief Justice , and thanks to his strategy , the Council had dropped its threat to have him executed . The ships were his guarantee that one day he would be set free again and restored to his right place in society , but it was hard to be patient and equally difficult to curb his disappointment over his continuingimprisonment . When the barks had first arrived , his hopes had risen , for the captains had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point of calling on him , they had told him that several members of the Council were weakening in their resolve to hold him prisoner . But Gabriel Archer had remained obdurate , apparently feeling that if he reversed his previous decision he would be admitting he had been mistaken . Therefore , Smith continued to languish in prison , and it was unpleasant to realize that many months would pass before the Royal Hope , which was scheduled to sail back to England in two weeks , would return to the New World with the writ from higher authority that would force Archer to release him . In the meantime , although it was true that he had almost completed the first volume of the book he intended to call A General History of Virginia , it disturbed him to see the colony decomposingand crumbling . His many visitors , whom Archer no longer dared forbid him to see , all told him the same dismal story . The newest recruits , more than one hundred and fifty in number , who had arrived on the ships , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group had been accorded . No preparations of any kind had been made to receive the newcomers , no homes had been built for them , and the older settlers were forced to share their houses with the homeless , which suited no one and created resentment on all sides . Sensible and farseeing administratorswould have realized that the present boundaries of Jamestown were inadequate and would have helped themselves to a larger slice of America 's virtually unlimited territory . But the palisades still stood where Smith had erected them when the population had been only a little more than half of what it was at present . The walls themselves were in disgraceful shape , Smith was told , and even men with no military experience could see that the colony was almost defenseless . Equally upsetting was the militia 's lack of morale , for Archer maintained no regular schedule of drills , capriciously punishedanyone who happened to displease him , and promoted his inexperiencedfavorites over the heads of the veterans whom Smith had placed in positions of authority . Many of the newcomers , who had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militia that they flatly refused to join it . Worst of all was the food situation , Smith realized from the scraps of information he pieced together . Archer had not bothered to ration the grain and meat that his predecessor had acquired from the Chickahominy , with the result that a serious famine had threatened but had been temporarily averted by the arrival of the ships from England . However , Archer had learned nothing and was repeating his error ; the suppliesthat had been carried in the holds of the vessels were limited but were being consumed at such a carelessly prodigal rate that the storehouseswould be empty long before the first harvest of the year could be reaped . Smith was powerless to intervene , for the members of the Council kept their distance from him , and whenever he made suggestions to some of the honest settlers who came to see him , the ideas were subsequently rejected by Archer , who needed only to suspect that advice came from Smith to do the opposite . Even the ships ' captains , who were in a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to exert no influence on the new president , and when they warned him they would report his lack of efficiency to their superiors , he defied them . Thereafter he made himself inaccessible for days , and it was rumored that he was preparing long letters to each of the Company 's officers , justifying his conduct.  |p145Every  evening , after Smith completed his day 's labors on his book , he spent several hours working by candlelight , meticulously keeping a recordof the data brought to him by his loyal friends . Someday , after he was set free , the full story of the mismanagement of the colony would be valuable information to place before the directors of the Company and would certainly result in the outright dismissal of Gabriel Archer . The work was tedious , but Smith did not object , as he was looking toward the future . There was one immediate benefit too : by staying up later than was his custom each night , he slept later every morning and thus helped to pass his endless days . Ordinarily he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one morning he was awakened by the unaccustomed sound of musket fire shortly after dawn . He sat bolt upright in his cot , and when he heard the town 's cannon boom , he dressed hastily and began to pace up and down the narrow confines of his cell . He looked out of his window repeatedly , but as it faced the blockhouse and the water he could see only the two ships and had no idea what might be taking place in the town itself . After a little while he made out a number of shadowy figures on the deck of the Susan Constant and finally distinguished them as seamen , armed with muskets , cutlasses , and knives ; some were manning the merchantman 's two demiculverins , while the others grouped themselves around the base of the bark 's main topsail . As nearly as he could judge , they were waiting for an attack of some sort , and after a quarter of an hour he guessed that the fight , whatever it might be , was going unfavorably , for all six of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoisted sail , too , and both vessels appeared to be poised for flight . The guards who usually were on duty at the prison had disappeared , and Smith alternately shouted and rattled the door of his cell , but no one bothered to come near him . The intensity of musket fire increased ; then , during a momentary lull , he heard a long , sharp war whoop and realized that Jamestown was being attacked by natives . He was only mildly surprised , and while he was still digesting the news he heard footsteps in the little corridor outside . Then his door burst open . A sergeant of militia , followed by a score of other settlers , some in uniform , some in drab shirts and breeches , crowded and jostled each other in an attempt to reach Smith 's side . All were shouting , all were waving weapons of various kinds , and in the confusion he could hear nothing they said . Jumping onto his cot , he gestured for silence , and the men responded instantly to his authority ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Captain Smith , " he said , " we been attacked by surprise . There 's Naturals all over the town . Inside the walls , everywhere . " " What tribe are they ? " The sergeant looked blank , but someone in the rear of the crowd called out , " Billy Jeffreys killed one , and his war paint was black and green . " " Rappahannock , " Smith said , and felt relieved . Had the attackers been Chickahominy , as he had feared , Powhatan would have sent an expeditionof sufficient size to wipe out the colony . " Captain Archer , " the sergeant declared , finding his voice again , " he do n't know what he 's doing out there . He 's directing cannon fire into the forest like he was a general on a French battlefield . Meantime them Indianskeep sneaking into town through openings in the walls and do terrible damage before we can flush them out . You got to help us , Captain . You 're the only one who can . " No second invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a musket into his hands , and he pushed his way out into the corridor . The men followed him as he stalked out into the open , bareheadedand clad only in his doublet and breeches ; but he needed neither armor nor a uniform to identify him as a military leader , and when he paused to survey the situation , the settlers sensed his authority and felt for the first time that a complete disaster might be averted . The defense , Smith saw , was confused and disorganized . Gabriel Archer was directing the fire of two cannon from positions behind the west wall and was wasting precious man power and effort while he sent iron ball after iron ball crashing harmlessly into the trees of the wildernessbeyond the gates . However , the day was not yet lost , for a few colonists with some concept of fundamentals stubbornly clung to positionson the crude observation platforms located at intervals on the top of the palisades . Ignoring the showers of arrows that rained on them , these courageous men maintained a steady musket fire , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the raiders at bay . Archer , however , was apparently unaware of their value and sent no reinforcements to help them or take the place of those who were killed or wounded . Meanwhile Rappahannock warriors were squeezing through gaps in the walls , sneaking into the town , and either knifing or tomahawking the terrorized settlers . Groups of militiamen and other colonists ran through the streets , hunting for the braves who were at large in the community , but they were operating without a cohesive plan , and their efforts wereP147impeded by sword-waving members of the Council , who seemed to be everywhere , issuing contradictory commands . Two fires were burning on the far side of the town and both seemed to be spreading , but it was impossible to determine whether or not any concerted effort was being made to put them out . So much needed to be done that Smith scarcely knew where to begin , but there was no time to lose , and he turned to the group behind him , which had grown larger as news of his release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who carried muskets to the platforms on the palisades , and they obeyed him instantly , dashing off in small groups . Next he sent several boys in their early teens , who were too young to take part in the actual fighting , to rally the settlers and to send every able-bodied man to him . Those who remained were dispatched to bring the fires under control , and Smith ordered them to enlist the aid of the women , whose help would be needed to bring buckets of water from the river . Then , as othersdrifted to the informal post he established on the crest of a small knoll , from which he could see much of what was taking place , he sent the colonists singly and in pairs to take up stations around the town 's perimeter to prevent still more Naturals from entering the community . One of the fires was quickly extinguished , but the other continued to burn fiercely , so Smith instructed the sergeants who had previously served under him and had now been drawn to him again , to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were put to work fightingthe blaze so the grown men would be free to take part in the battle . Gradually some semblance of order was restored , and even though an unknown number of savages still lurked inside the palisades , ready to spring at the unwary , Smith could not concern himself with this relativelyminor danger until the impetus of the enemy attack was checked . Occasionally , as he gave orders , made sure they were intelligently obeyed , and listened to the reports of his sergeants , he was vaguely aware of the presence of one or another member of the Council in the immediatevicinity , but he ignored them , and they were either afraid of him or too abashed to come near him . He concentrated on the most urgent tasks for the better part of a half hour , and only when some semblance of discipline had been established and the colonists appeared to be holding their own did he turn his attention to Gabriel Archer , who was still devoting himself to directing the cannon fire and seemed neither to know nor care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With two sergeants and a pike-bearing corporal atp148his heels , Smith finally descended the little hill from which he had been supervising the defense , and , his mouth set in a thin line , he approached the cannon . " Cease fire ! " he shouted , and the gunners , making no secret of their pleasure at seeing him , obeyed instantly . " Join the rest of the militia at the palisades , " he told them , " and do n't let any savages through . Men from crew number one go to the west wall . Those from crew number two go to the south wall . Our line there is n't as heavy as it should be . " Abandoning their guns , the men scattered , and Archer , his face powder-blackened , stared at his enemy . " You 've been illegally released from prison , " he said , and turned to the sergeants . " Take him back to his cell at once ! I 'll deal later with whoever is responsible for this outrage . Smith , you 've destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes , I hold you responsible for whatever failure we may now suffer . " " There will be no more cannon fire , " Smith replied evenly , and looked away for a moment to observe whether the militiamen on the nearest towers were still functioning efficiently or whether they needed fresh reinforcements . Archer brandished his sword at the sergeants . " Do you dare disobey the order of the president of the Council ? I 'll have you hung for mutiny unless you take this criminal back to the prison ! " They did not move , and Smith had no time to waste on a futile argumentwith a pompous dunce . " You 're no longer in command , Archer , " he said crisply . " I 've taken charge of the town 's defenses . " This was the last straw , and the enraged Archer raised his sword and slashed wildly at his foe . But Smith side-stepped calmly , and in the same motion knocked the blade from the other 's grasp with the butt of his musket . It was absurd to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony , and Smith was determined to end the farce at once . Moving forward on the balls of his feet , he smashed his right fist into Archer 's face , then followed the blow with an equally brutal left . Frustration and righteous anger gave him added strength , and Archer , moaning and covering his battered face with his hands , sank to his knees . Smith , his features expressionless , turned to the pikeman . " Take him off to the prison and lock him up in my old cell until the battle is over , " he said . " He 'll be out of harm 's way there and wo n't be able to do any more damage . If you can find a couple of people who are n't too busy , get them to help you . But under no circumstances let him go free , orp149there 's no telling what might happen to Jamestown before the day ends . " Beckoning to the sergeants , he hurried off to the palisades and promptly forgot Gabriel Archer . One of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he felt better when his fingers closed over the hilt . For some reason he could not explain he felt a surge of renewed confidence , and his lurking doubts that he might not be able to drive off the invaders vanished . He inspected the perimeter , encouraging the men who peered out between the logs , occasionally taking a musket and firing it himself , and his buoyant optimism gave new courage to the defenders , even those surly and frightened newcomers who had given up all hope of salvation . He devoted special attention to those near the holes in the walls and showed them how to redistribute themselves on either side of the gaps so they would not be seen by the savages outside yet would be able to move forward quickly to kill any native braves who might try to climb through the openings . When he was satisfied that the palisades were secure , he raced to the area where the fire was still burning but was delighted to see that the women and adolescents had brought it under control . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning , but considerable quantities of water had been poured on the cabins closest to the flames , and there seemed to be little danger that the fire would continue to spread . Smith lavishly praised everyone in sight and then walked rapidly to the nearest observation platform to gauge the Naturals ' strength . The arrows of the Rappahannock were thickest here , but Smith was impervious to personal danger , and instead of crouching close to the wooden flooring , as the militiamen did , he stood , coolly looked out over the top of a little three-foot-high parapet , and surveyed the surrounding territory . When he had been president of the Council he had insisted that all trees and foliage within two hundred and fifty yards of the walls be cut down , but during the intervening months no one had bothered to maintain such simple precautions , and only those portions of the land that were being used to raise crops were still clear . Elsewhere the underbrushhad sprung up again , and here and there he could catch glimpses of the dark bodies of Rappahannock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Luckily the sun had come out and filtered through the bare branches of the trees in the forest , so he was able to make out shadowy outlines in the forest too . But there was no way to judge how many braves the Naturals had sent against Jamestown , and Smith reflected that it would be suicide to send a counterattacking force out through the gates , Thep150idea of confining himself to a defensive battle was repugnant to him , but he had no alternative , he knew , and would have to rely on the marksmanshipof the settlers to discourage and disperse the Indians . The colonists were paying a stiff price for their recent negligence ; however , Smith noted , the arrows of the savages wounded many but killed only a few , and a surprisingly large number of those who were struck managed to pull out the shafts , bind up their wounds , and , ignoringtheir pain and discomfort , continue to do battle . The Naturals ' losses were far heavier , Smith was happy to see , for the accurate musket fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No army , regardless of whether it was composed of trained soldiers or primitive tribesmen , could remain in the field indefinitely when its ranks were being systematicallydecimated , Smith knew , so he felt certain that the settlers ' ultimate victory was now assured . Sooner or later the Rappahannock chiefs who were responsible for the assault would realize they could absorbno more punishment and would withdraw , provided the defenders did not relax . Smith did not believe in taking risks that could be avoided , and as he was persuaded that troops always fought best when they understood the principles of the battle tactics involved , he made a quick tour of the perimeter again , visiting each observation platform in turn . He explained his conclusions , he encouraged the men to be vigilant and maintain a steady fire , and he assured them that if they did not falter the savages would be forced to admit defeat and would withdraw . He arranged to send gunpowder and ammunition to the platforms at regular intervals and he instructed the sergeants to call on every settler who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , firmly convinced that the defeat of the Indians was inevitable , Smith turned his attention to the comparatively minor but nevertheless hazardous problem of exterminating the warriors who were hiding insidethe walls . First he rounded up every able-bodied man who was not already occupied , and as so few colonists were available for the task , he pressed the members of the Council into service and requested help from the captains of the Susan Constant and Royal Hope , whose barks were no longer in danger of being captured and sunk . Dividing Jamestown into four sectors , he assigned a group to scour each ; every building was to be searched , and he warned the men that the savages were desperate and cunning warriors who would use imaginationin finding unusual hiding places . It was far easier to illustrate his thesis than to explain it , and so , accompanied by six colonists andp151three sailors whom he chose at random , he started down the nearest street while the others watched . He and his companions searched three houses in vain , but when they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors uncovered a painted brave who was waiting in ambush for potential victims under a pile of cornhusks and trash in a small yard . Before the warrior could either fight back or escape , the sailor put a pistol shot through his head , and the onlookers cheered . Smith , understandably nervous over the damage that might be done to the colony 's meager supplies , led the way into a warehouse in which sacks of flour and barrels of salt fish were stacked . It was dark inside the barnlike structure , and he and his men fanned out before proceeding cautiously into the building . They had gone no more than a few feet , poking into every crevice , when a tall warrior suddenly materialized out of the shadows , waving something in his hand . " Smith , King of James , " he cried in his own tongue , " hear my voice ! " But Smith had no intention of being tricked and , lunging forward , skewered the savage on his sword . As the Rappahannock brave fell , he flung something at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft strip of leather strike his face . It looked like a wampum belt , although he could not see it clearly , but he had more important matters on his mind and jammed it absently into his pocket . The hunt continued , and the curious incident completely slipped his mind . The searching parties now knew what was expected of them and departedfor their respective sectors , while Smith returned to the walls . During the next hour nine more warriors were found inside the town and all of them were killed , although two of the settlers lost their lives in the process too . Many of the women and smaller children , who had gone to the barks at Smith 's orders earlier in the battle , sent word to him that they wanted to return to their homes now that Jamestown was once more safe , but he refused to grant their request , as he was afraid the attackers might resort to throwing lighted firebrands over the walls when they realized that their frontal assault had failed . But his fears proved to be groundless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stopped . Smith , staring out over the parapetof an observation tower , finally realized that the Rappahannock had conceded victory to the colonists and had withdrawn . There was a chance , of course , that the retreat was not genuine and that the war party was lurking in the wilderness nearby , waiting to return as soon as the settlers relaxed . But Smith refused to be fooled and , taking with him a number of the original colonists who had become familiar with the for-P152ests , he spent the next hour painstakingly following the tracks of the savages . Only when he was thoroughly satisfied that they were indeed gone did he return to the town and announce that the victory was absolute . And even then he gave Jamestown no opportunity to rest on its laurels . Burial parties were organized , young men were put to work repairing the holes in the palisades that had almost proved fatal , and guards were posted at the warehouses to prevent looting . Smith had eaten nothing all day , but rather than pause for a meal he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roamed the town restlessly , overseeing the repairs . Everyone in Jamestown wanted to shake his hand and thank him for saving the colony ; he accepted the gratitude and congratulations of Council members and ordinary settlers alike , and as usual he was graciously modest . The church had been converted into a temporary hospital , and he spent more than an hour cheering the wounded . Then he visited the families of each of the dead and promised them the names of the heroes who had died defending the town would be chiseled on a stone tablet he intended to erect in their memory . Men marveled at his boundless energy when he reappeared at the parade ground , rounded up another group of volunteers , and gave directions to clear the ground where the gutted houses had stood , to extend the west palisades and begin preparingthe ground beyond the present boundary for the new houses he intended to construct at once for all who were homeless . The colonists were tired , physically and emotionally , but his enthusiasminfused them with renewed energy , and everyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his pockets for parched corn as he walked , made a special point of speaking to each of the new arrivals whom he had not met previously , and they responded instantly to his kindness and the strength they sensed in him . At one time or another each of the Council members came to him and offered him an apology ; neither they nor he specifically raised the issue that he was still under a technical death sentence , but it was tacitly agreed that the charge against him would be quietly dropped . By late afternoon only one urgent issue had not yet been settled , and Smith started toward the prison for a final reckoning with Gabriel Archer . He was still hungry , and as he dug in the pocket of his breeches for any stray kernels of corn he might have missed , his fingers touched the wampum belt that the Indian warrior whom he had killed had thrown at him . Taking the beaded strip of leather from his pocket , hep153glanced at it idly ; then he stopped short and stared at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but recognizable figure of an Indian woman , and his heart pounded when he saw she was wearing an ornate , multifeathered white headdress . Several people who were laboring to clear up wreckage nearby saw his strained , pale face and thought he was ill , but when they hurried to him he silently waved them away and continued to gaze at the wampum . He knew now beyond all doubt that Pocahontas had inspired the attack and that the Rappahannock had carried it out under her father 's instructions . Until this moment the raid had been meaningless to him , and he had been at a complete loss to understand why a tribe that was presumablyfriendly to the English would have launched such a vicious surprise assault . But the figure on the belt explained everything to him , and his amazement gave way to a hard , cold anger . Powhatan had tricked him once and had forced him to undergo a series of humiliations , culminating in the native wedding ceremony that had made Pocahontas his " wife , " but no one , least of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second time . He realized that the attack had been a clear warning and that there would be worse to come if he failed to send for Pocahontas , but he told himself that the attempt to frighten him merely strengthened his resolve to have no more to do with her . The wench and her father had erred in their judgment of him , and he reflected grimly that no power on earth was great enough to persuade , cajole , or force him to bring Pocahontas to Jamestown . He would be on his guard now , and the next time an Indian attack was launched against the colony he would be ready for it . Powhatan would be cautious , of course , after the defeat his Rappahannock had sustained , but when he eventually gathered his full strength and tried again , he would be repulsedwith even greater losses . Pocahontas needed to be taught a lesson , and perhaps , when her father was utterly crushed , she would learn that it was unwise to try to intimidate John Smith . Self-righteous anger flared up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into his pocket he damned Pocahontas with all his heart . Never in all his experience had he encountered a woman so insensitiveto a man 's desires and wishes , and he was sorry he had ever set eyes on her , sorrier still that he had encouraged her to use what little mind she possessed . But he would show her he could match her callousness , and when Powhatan again tried to intervene on her behalf , hep154would give the Naturals a demonstration of brutal warfare they would never forget . What irritated him most was Pocahontas 's blind , unreasoning insistencethat she had a place in his life . Naturally her horizons were too limited for her to understand that a permanent relationship between them would hamper his future , and she could not know that King James would never elevate a man who was married to a stupid American savage to the nobility . What she certainly could realize , but obviously would not , was that there was no legitimate reason for him to remain tied to her . By any civilized standards he owed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebted to him for having taught her to speak and read English , and the very least she could do for him in return would be to disappear gracefully and permanently from his life . The next time he indulged in an affair , he promised himself , he would select a married woman and would avoid complications . Dusk was beginning to fall as he roused himself and went on to the prison , and the men who had been working to clear up the debris of battle were now drifting toward their homes . When they saw Smith halt outside the prison , they knew that something out of the ordinary was going to take place , and a few moments later , when two militiamen escortedGabriel Archer into the open , word spread and a large crowd gathered . Smith 's resentment and anger at his rival was as great as his rage at Pocahontas , but he knew he would need to exercise a measure of cautionbefore the people of the colony . If he allowed his true feelings to show , he would lose sympathy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought before him , " I 'll relieve you of your sash of office . It rightfully belongs to me , and I 'll take it from you . " The last time they had stood in almost this same spot their positions had been reversed , and Archer was well aware of the delicacy of his position . He was unpopular with the settlers , who idolized his enemy , and they would give Smith their wholehearted support . Nevertheless , he was not lacking in courage . " I challenge your right to remove me from office , " he shouted . " Only the Council elects and deposes its president . " Smith laughed and managed to sound genuinely amused . " A majority of the Council is here right now , " he said . " Ask them if they intend to sustain you . Or better still , ask the people which of us they prefer . " The crowd shouted in favor of its hero , and those members of the Council who entertained private doubts as to the legality of Smith 's seizure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They knew ,  |p155too  , that Archer 's inefficiency and bungling had caused a near catastropheand that only Smith 's energetic intervention had saved the colony from destruction . So they said nothing . " The sash , if you please . " Smith held out his hand . Archer glared at him but did not move , and one of the veterans of the battle dashed forward out of the crowd , jerked the ribbon from his body , and handed it to Smith . Smiling faintly , Smith draped it across his chest , and again the throng cheered . He had recovered the symbol of office so easily and quickly that he was a little surprised at how simple the move had been . He had anticipated far more difficulty , but now that he was again the president of the Council , he decided to be rid of his nettlesomefoe permanently . " Gabriel Archer , " he said slowly in a voice that carried to every corner of the parade ground , " you were derelict in your duty to the King , to the owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamestown . Your failure to provide adequate defenses for the colony has cost us the lives of more than twenty brave men and three innocent women . You are therefore unworthy to be a member of this colony . If I treated you as you deserve , I 'd send you out into the wilderness to starve or be killed by the savages . But , just as King James is a merciful ruler , so I , as his chief officerin the New World , am merciful . I therefore sentence you to be returned to England . Is Captain Matteson of the Royal Hope present ? " " Right here , Captain Smith ! " shouted a man in the crowd . " Captain , I request you to give Archer passage to Plymouth when you sail in a fortnight 's time . Until then be good enough to lock him in irons aboard your bark so he can cause no more harm here . " " Aye , aye , sir , " the master of the Royal Hope replied . Archer , goaded beyond endurance , broke away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recapture him , but they were clumsy , and in the brief scuffle that followed he cleverly caught hold of the pistol one of them carried in his belt . Darting away from the guards , he cursed under his breath and after a brief , frantic effort managed to cock the weapon . Meantime Smith did not remain inactive and , realizing his sword would be ineffective against firearms , he reached out and took a whip from one of the nearest spectators , a man who had been driving a cart pulled by two Indian work horses acquired some months previously from the Chesapeake . By the time Archer turned and aimed the pistol at his enemy , Smith was ready for him , and the whip cracked . The long rawhide thong wrapped itself around the pistol , and when Smith jerked the handle thep156gun was wrenched from Archer 's hand and sailed over the heads of the crowd , landing somewhere on the far side of the parade ground . Archer lurched forward , his bare hands extended , his fingers curling , but Smith halted him abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again and again the long strip of leather sang through the air , and Archer 's desire to commit murder cooled as the lash cut into his flesh . Smith coldly subjected him to the ultimate degradation by methodically whipping him until he could stand no more pain and tried to flee . But the rawhide ribbon curled around his right ankle , halting him , and when he stumbled and fell to the ground , five or six militiamen pounced on him . The crowd would have applauded , but Smith , his face grave , silencedthem with a wave of his free hand . Tossing the whip to its owner , he glanced for a moment at the prostrate figure of his adversary , and those who stood near him swore afterward that pity and compassion were plainly written on his face . Then , adjusting the sash of the presidency and carrying himself as though the burden of the office were unbearably heavy , he walked off slowly into the twilight . In the next few weeks the colonists worked day and night , rectifying costly mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained and no one felt abused , for Captain Smith asked nothing of any settler that he was unwilling to do himself , and even the few who disliked him had to admit he set an inspiring example . When the Royal Hope sailed for England with the discredited Gabriel Archer on board , the settlers were far too busy to pay any attention to his departure , and the feud that had caused so much turmoil in the short history of Jamestown came to an ignominious and apathetic end . Under Smith 's direction the revitalized colonists built enough homes to house themselves , and at least one hundred more families were expected to arrive during the next year . Food supplies were carefully rationed , and one hundred acres of the wilderness were cleared in preparation for spring planting . Jamestown would never again be reduced to near starvation if Smith had his way , and he was planning to make the colony self-sufficient , so that trades with the natives would be unnecessary . New walls were built , and the president inspected them often to assure himself that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than satisfactory in battle , so Smith had new fortifications erected ; enclosed towers , each of them a miniature , self/contained blockhouse , studded the palisades at regular intervals , and guards were stationed in them twenty-four hours a day . From time to time the sentries reported the presence of Indian scouts in the forest , and had they been left to their own devices the settlers would have fired at anything they saw moving behind the screen of trees . But Smith had given strict instructions that Natural spies were not to be molested , and his orders were obeyed willingly , for the militiamen were forced to agree with his logic . Warriors who saw Jamestown 's bristling state of preparedness , he said , could only report to their chiefs that the colony was invulnerable . Muskets showed in the chinks between logs , a vast area outside the walls had been cleared of all trees and underbrush , and cannon poked their long barrels above the palisades on every side , so even stupid savages who had no real understanding of modern scientificwarfare would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smith secretly hoped that Powhatan would launch a new assault , as he was anxious to put the Chickahominy in their place for all time , but Pocahontas 's father apparently recognized the superior power of the settlersand kept his distance . Obviously he was biding his time , waiting for the town to relax its vigilance , but Smith knew better than to be lulled into a sense of false security and held himself and his men ready for action at all times . Ten days before the Susan Constant was scheduled to leave for England , a fleet of four vessels sailed up the James River , and a new group of recruits arrived , together with more foodstuffs , arms , and ammunition than had ever before been sent to the New World by the directors of the London Company . A knight , Sir Thomas Dale , was in charge of the party , and he carried written orders naming Smith as governor . The shareholders , disturbed by the squabbles that had stunted Jamestown 's development , had decided to place full authority in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elated over his promotion , Smith conducted Sir Thomas , who was to act as his deputy , on a tour of the town . They were accompanied by several gentlemen who had just arrived , and one of them was smoking a pipe . This thoughtless act , which was meaningless in itself , accomplishedwhat neither Powhatan nor Gabriel Archer had been able to achieve . The party inspected homes , stockades , warehouses , and the church , and as they were examining an arsenal in which muskets and ammunition were stored , a spark from the glowing pipe landed on a bag of gunpowderand set it on fire . The powder flared up , and Smith , who hadp158been engaged in earnest conversation with Sir Thomas , turned just in time to see flames reaching out in every direction . He realized that within a few seconds the fire would spread and that only a miracle would save the precious war materiel . Not believing in miracles other than those he performed himself , he unhesitatingly threw himself onto the flames and extinguished the fire by rolling back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments after it had begun , but its consequenceswere far-reaching , for Smith suffered severe burns . His pain was intense , but he bore it stoically , knowing he had once again performed an act of heroism that would add to the luster of his name . However , the community 's surgeon , who applied bear grease and sassafras poultices to the burns , declared that Smith would be unable to resume his duties as governor for at least six months . He strongly advised his patient to return to England , and Smith , who was confined to his bed and hence had nothing better to occupy his mind , thought of little else for several days . Finally , after carefully weighing all of the factors involved , he decided to follow the surgeon 's suggestion . The colony was now firmly established , thanks to his efforts , and if he remained here he would be required to spend most of his time and effort on administrative duties in the next few years . Methodical , conscientious men like Sir Thomas were far better suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Smith wanted to conquer fresh fields . Thanks to Powhatan 's enmity , he did not dare go out on any new trips of exploration anywhere in Virginia , as he was sure he would be captured and returned to Pocahontas if he ventured far from the palisades of Jamestown . Hence it would be wise to return to England now , while his glory was fresh and he could capitalizeon it . Then , at some later date , he would sail on a new expedition to some other part of America . The New World , he was convinced , was far larger than even explorers like Sir Walter Raleigh realized , and there was unlimited opportunity for him to win new honors for himself in regions where Pocahontas 's influence could not reach out and touch him . And so he made up his mind to leave on the Susan Constant , the same ship that had carried him here . He thought only of the future now , of the sensation he would create in London , and of the book that would make him famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaving , but he was in high spirits in spite of his burns , and he insisted on packing his belong/ings himself . He entrusted his maps and manuscripts to no one , and when his other possessions were carried aboard the bark , he kept his papers apart and permitted no one else to touch them . Somewhere inside the bundle was the wampum belt that Pocahontas had sent him , and it amused him to think that he might someday incorporate some carefully edited portions of their story in the second volume of his General Historyof Virginia . It would be a shame not to use material that would certainly interest romantically inclined readers , and although the experience itself had been insignificant , Englishmen , who loved the unusual and bizarre , would be fascinated by his account of the little savage who had tried without success to transform herself into what she could never become , a Christian , a civilized person , and a lady.  |p160Every  room in the Whitehall Palace was drafty , gloomy , and damp , and the King 's private conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thick rugs were spread on the floors , in imitation of the Spaniards , whom His Majesty professed to hate , but the roaring fire in the hearth at the north end of the room failed to dissipate the chill , and the heat escaped through wide cracks between the stones in the walls near the high ceiling . As usual , the only person present who was reasonably comfortable was King James , whose chair at the head of the Privy Council table was placed conveniently close to the hearth , but as usual he made the only complaint . " We feel sure that even in the wildest parts of America you suffered no inconveniences worse than the discomforts that make our life here so unpleasant , Captain Smith , " he said in his high , shrill voice marked by a thick Scottish burr . His Lord Chamberlain , the Earl of Suffolk , exchanged a covert glance with the Duke of Buckingham , who sat opposite him . When the King was in a petulant mood he frequently wasted hours whining about imagined hardships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply but , seeingthe others at the table stiffen , he weighed the matter carefully . He had waited many weeks for this appointment and he intended to miss no opportunity to impress either King James or the other great gentlemen who could , if they wished , make him wealthy and powerful . This was obviously a day when good luck and boldness would pay heavy dividends , provided he was willing to take chances , and he decided that false modesty would avail him nothing . Fortune had first smiled on him **28;378;TOOLONG undcpcndability of juries , the chance involved , is one of the absorbing features of the law . That 's what makes the practice of law , like prostitution , one of the last of the unpredictable professions ? both employ the seductive arts , both try to display their wares to the best advantage , and both must pretend enthusiastically to woo total strangers . And that 's why most successful trial lawyers are helplessshowmen ; that 's why they are about nine-tenths ham actor and one-tenth lawyer . But as things now stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The judge would be virtually forced to instructthe jury to convict you . Do n't you see ? A jury would find it tough to let you go ; they 'd have to really work at it . Legally your situation presents a classic one of premeditated murder . " Quietly : " You do n't want to take my case , then ? " " Not quite so fast . I 'm not ready to make that decision . Look , in a murder case the jury has only a few narrow choices . Among them , it might let you go . It might also up and convict you . A judge trying you without a jury would surely have to , as I have said . Now do you want to go into court with the dice loaded ? With all the law and instructions stacked against you ? " I paused to deliver my clincher . " Well , whether you 're willing to do so , I 'm not . I will either find a sound and plausible legal defense in your case or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then there 's one other possible ' or else . ' " " Or else what ? " A chastening hint , a light play on the client 's fear that the lawyer of his choice might walk out on hint is also sound strategy during the Lecture . It tends to keep the subject both alert and appropriately humble . " Or else , Lieutenant , you can find yourself another lawyer , " I said , waiting for him to squirm . " Like who ? " the Lieutenant inquired coolly and without squirming . " Who do you recommend ? " Things were n't proceeding according to plan . But I could n't back down or display weakness now . If this cool bastard wanted someone like roaring old Crocker he could damn well have him . " Why , we have a splendid old ham-acting lawyer in this county , " I replied . " IIe 's all ha  --  eal boneless country-cured ham . He 's also the Peninsula 's expert on unwritten law . " I could have added , but charitably did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never known him to crack a law book . " I might even intercede for you with him , " I said . " You mean Amos Crocker ? " he said calmly . I lifted my eyebrows in surprise . " Maybe , " I parried . " How come you know about Crocker ? " " We tried to get him , " Mister Cool replied . " Could n't because he 'd broken his leg . " " Leg ? " I said . " Old Crocker broke his leg ? I did n't know . " I felt a sudden wave of pity for the windy fulminating old fraud . Beside Parnell McCarthy he was about the last of the old-time colorful gallus-snapping practitioners left in the county . The rest of us were getting to be a fine , colorless , soft-shoe breed , something like a cross between a claims adjuster and an ulcerated public accountant . " When did all this happen ? " " The very night I shot Quill , " the Lieutenant said . " Fell climbing out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is in the hospital with his leg in traction . Wo n't be up and around for several months . " The Lieutenant looked around the room and sniffed slightly . " That 's a trifle too long to wait around in this place . If I 've got to go to prison I want to get on with it . " " Hm , " I said thoughtfully . I felt curiously chastened and deflated . Here was a client , I saw , who possessed a pretty good lecture style of his own . I found myself fretfully hoping that I was at least the second choice . The thought gnawed at me . " I hope I was the second choice ? " I said . " You were , " the Lieutenant replied quietly . " By the way , what 's this cop out ' mean ? " The Lieutenant had not only delivered a swift little lecture of his own ; he 'd also adroitly got me back on my own . " Lieutenant , I 'm charmed , " I said , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop out means pretty much the same thing : to plead guilty , toss in the sponge , grab at a straw , confess to the cops , o  --  s the old English judges so quaintly put i  --  brow oneself upon the country . " It was rather a big mouthful and the Lieutenant thoughtfully chewed on it . " Hm . . . . You mean you simply do n't want to take a chance on the unwritten law ' ? " I stared up at the ceiling , pursing my lips . " You can put it that way if you want . Yes , that 's fair enough . I 'm a lawyer , not a juggler or a hypnotist nor even a magician or boy orator . When I undertake to defend a man before a jury I want to have a fighting legal chance to acquit him . That includes having a decent chance to move for a new trial or successfully appeal . Maybe you were morally entitled to plug Barney Quill . I 'll even concede it . But in court I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless possess my fair share of ham , like most lawyers , but I do not want to go into court and depend simply upon the charity or stupidity or state of the liver of twelve jurors . " I paused . With old Crocker now safely out of the picture I could perhaps afford to bear down even harder . " What 's more , I do n't intend to , " I said . " Have I made myself clear ? " " Fin afraid you have , Counselor . " " And , since you still seem to hug the ' unwritten law , ' there 's one more thing . There 's the important matter of saving face . We complacentpalefaces of the West like to think that this business of saving face is a sin , a sort of half-juvenile and half-inscrutable mystique confined solely to the Orient . " I paused . " That 's a lot of ? a lot of unmitigated ? " " Horseshit , " Lieutenant Manion said , as solemn as an owl . " Precisely , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lieutenant . And thanks . But getting back to face . . . . All of us , everywhere , all of the time , spend our waking hours saving face . This case itself is riddled with face . After all , one of the mute unspoken reasons you are being prosecuted is to save face , community face . The biggest reason I hesitate to take your case , as things now stand , is my fear of losing it . That is merely a negative form of advance face-saving . Face , face , face . Everybody has to save face , and , whether they have to or not , everyone tries to ; it 's one of the basic compulsions of men . " I paused . " Are you following me ? " " Yes . It 's most interesting , " he answered gravely . I glanced at him keenly . It was rather hard at times , I saw , to tell when this character was being sarcastic . " ' Thanks , " I said . " That brings me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get this now . The jury in your case might simply he dying to let you go on your own story , or because they have fallen for your wife , or have learned to hate Barney Quill 's guts , or all of these things and more . But if the judg  --  ho 's got nice big legal face to save , to  --  ust under the law virtually tell the jurors to convict you , as I think he must now surely do , then the only way they can possibly let you go is by flying in the face of the judge 's instruction  --  hat is , by losing , not saving face . Do n't you sec ? You and I would be in there asking twelve citizens , twelve total strangers , to publicly lose their precious face to save yours . It 's asking a lot and I hope you do n't have to risk it . " Lieutenant Manion produced the Ming holder and studied itcarefully , as though for the first time . " What do you recommend then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know yet . So far I 've been trying to impress you with the importance , the naked necessity , of our finding a valid legal defense , if one exists , in addition to the ' unwrittenlaw ' you so dearly want to cling to . Put it this way : what Barney Quill might have done to your wife before you killed him may present a favorable condition , an equitable climate , to a possible jury acquittal . But alone it simply is n't enough . " I paused . " Not enough for Paul Biegler , anyway . " " You mean you want to find a way to give the jurors some decentlyplausible legal peg to hang their verdict on so that they might let me g  --  nd still save face ? " My man was responding beautifully to the lecture . " Precisely , " I said , adding hastily : " Whether you have such a defense of course remains to be seen . But I hope , Lieutenant , I have shown you how vital it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have , Counselor , " he said slowly . " I rather think now you really have . " He paused . " Tell me , tell me more about this justification or excuse business . Excuse me , " he added , smiling faintly , " I mean legal justification or excuse . " " First I got to go phone my office , " I said , arising . " That 'll also give me a chance for some solitary skull practice . It 's been quite a while since I 've had to brush up on my murder . " chapter 6I was back with my man and ready to go . The signs were good : for the first time he was smoking without the Ming holder . " We will now explore the absorbing subject of legal justification or excuse , " I said . " You may fire when ready , Gridley , " the Lieutenant said . I looked hopefully at the man . Was it barely possible that he possessed a rudimentary sense of humor ? " Well , take self-defense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of justifiable homicide . On the basis of what I 've so far heard and read about your case I do not think we need pause too long over that . Do you ? " " Perhaps not , " Lieutenant Manion conceded . " We 'll pass it for now. , , " Let 's , " I said dryly . " Then there 's the defense of habitation , defenseof property , and the defense of relatives or friends . Now there are more ramifications to these defenses than a dog has fleas , but we wo n't explore them now . I 've already told you at length why I do n't think you can invoke the possible defense of your wife . When you shot Quill her need for defense had passed . It 's as simple as that . " " Go on , " Lieutenant Manion said , frowning . " Then there 's the defense of a homicide committed to prevent a felon  --  ay you 're being robbed ? ; to prevent the escape of the felo  --  uppose he 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felo  --  ou 've caught up with him and he 's either trying to get away or has actually escaped . " At this point I paused and blinked thoughtfully . An idea no bigger than a pea rattled faintly at the back door of my mind . Let 's sec . . . . Would n't it be true that if Barney Quill actually raped Laura Manion he would be a felon at large at the time he was shot ? The pea kept faintly rattling . But so what , so what ? " Hm . . . . " I said . It would bear pondering . The Lieutenant 's eyes gleamed and bored into mine . " Wh  --  hat do you see ? " he said . It was becoming increasingly clear that this soldier was no dummy . " Nothing , " I lied glibly . " Not a thing . " The student was gettingahead of the lecturer and that would never do . And wherever myidea might drop into the ultimate defense picture , I sensed that nowwas not the time to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I concluded . " Yes , " Lieutenant Manion said . " You were just thinking . " Hesmiled faintly . " Go on , then ; what are some of the other legal justificationsor excuses ? " " Then there 's the tricky and dubious defense of intoxication . Personally I 've never seen it succeed . But since you were not drunk when you shot Quill we shall mercifully not dwell on that . Or were you ? " " I was cold sober . Please go on . " " Then finally there 's the defense of insanity . " I paused and spoke abruptly , airily : " Well , that just about winds it up . " I arose as though making ready to leave . " Tell me more . " " There is no more . " I slowly paced up and down the room . " I mean about this insanity . " " Oh , insanity , " I said , elaborately surprised . It was like luring a trained seal with a herring . " Well , insanity , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not legally justify the killing , like self-defense , say , but rather excuses it . " The lecturer was hitting his stride . He was also on the home stretch . " Our law requires that a punishable killin  --  n fact , any crim  --  ust be committed by a sapient human being , one capable , as the law insists , of distinguishingbetween right and wrong . If a man is insane , legally insane , the act of homicide may still be murder but the law excuses the perpetrator . " Lieutenant Manion was sitting erect now , very still and erect . " I se  --  nd thi  --  his perpetrator , what happens to him if he should ? should be excused ? " " Under Michigan la  --  ike that of many other state  --  f he is acquitted of murder on the grounds of insanity it is provided that he must be sent to a hospital for the criminally insane until he is pronounced sane . " I drummed my fingers on the Sheriff 's desk and glanced at my watch , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was baying along the scent now . " How long does it take to get him out of there ? " " Out of where ? " I asked innocently . " Out of this insane hospital ! " " Oh , you mean where a man claims he was insane at the time of the offense but is sane at the time of the trial and his possible acquittal ? " " Exactly . " " I do n't know , " I said , stroking my chin . " Months , maybe ayear . It really takes a hit of doing . Being D.A . so long I 've never really had to study that phase of it . I got them in there ; it was somebody else 's problem to spring them . And I did n't dream this defensemight conic up in your case . " My naivete was somewhat excessive ; it had been obvious to me from merely reading the newspaper the night before that insanity was the best , if not the only , legal defense the man had . And here 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him this was thc last . Only a cretin could have missed it , and I was rapidly learning that Lieutenant Manion was no cretin. " ' fell Inc more , " Lieutenant Manion said quietly. " 1 may add that the law that requires persons acquitted on the grounds of insanity to be sent away is designed to discourage phony pleas of insanity in criminal cases . " " Yes ? " " So the man who successfully invokes the defense of insanity is taking a calculated risk , like the time you took the chance that the old German lieutenant was alone behind his ruined chimney . " I paused and knocked out my pipe . The Lecture was about over . The rest was up to the student . The Lieutenant looked out the window . He studied his Ming holder . I sat very still . Then he looked at me . " Maybe , " he said , " maybe I was insane . " Very casually : " Maybe you were insane when ? " I said . " When you shot the German lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shot Barney Quill . " I neightfully : " IIn1 . . . . Why do you say that ? " " Well , I ca n't really say , " he went on slowly . "  --  guess I blacked out . I ca n't remember a thing after I saw him standing behind the bar that night until I got back to my trailer . " " You wea  --  ou mean you do n't remember shooting him ? " I shook my head in wonderment . " Yes , that 's what I mean . " " You do n't even remember driving home ? " " No . " " You do n't even remember threatening Barney 's bartender when he followed you outside after the shootin  --  s the newspaper says you did ? " I paused and held my breath . " You do n't remember tellinghim , Do you want some , too , Buster ? ' ? " The smoldering dark eyes flickered ever so little . " No , not a thing . " 46 " Mv , my , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it all . " Maybe you 've got something there . " The Lecture was over ; I had told my man the law ; and now he had told me things that might possibly invoke the defense of insanity . It had all been done with mirrors . Or rather with padded hammers . There remained only the loose ends to gather in . I 'd try to make it short . I turned and looked out the sooty window . " Let me think a minute , " I said . Then I turned and studied the impaled cockroach . All right , I though  --  aybe my man was insane when he shot Barney Quill . Maybe he was nuttier than a fruit cake and maybe he had blacked out and did n't remember a thing . So far so good . But there was one flaw , one small thorn iii this insanity business , and one that had to be faced , and fast . And was n't it far better to face it now , before I got committed in the case , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned back to my man . " Look , Lieutenant . Hold your hat . I 'm about to pitch you a fast ball . . . . Maybe you were insane . Maybe you did n't remember a thing . But you and the newspaper agree on one thing . Both of you tell me that right after you returned to the trailer park , after shooting Barney Quill , you woke up the deputized caretaker and told him : ' I just shot Barney Quill . ' Now is that correct ? " Again I held my breath . I rather think he saw what was coming , but he replied steadily enough . " That is right , " he answered because he had to , there was no other answer , no escape ; he was already committed on that one far past the point of no return . Slowly , easily : " All right , then , Lieutenant . Now tell me , how come you could tell the caretaker you had just shot Barney Quill if you had really blacked out and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " he began . Then he stopped cold and closed his eyes . He was stalled . It was the first time I 'd seen him really grope . The silencecontinued . Was I , I wondered , developing into one of those incurable ex-D.A. ' s , the unreconstructed kind who can always find more reasons for convicting their clients than acquitting them ? " Come , come , Lieutenant , " I said . " Think ! " Impatiently , the lower lip still projected : " I am thinking ! I 'm trying to remember , damn it . " I was thankful a jury was n't watching him during the process . It47also occurred to me that he must have been a charming child . " Come , now , man , " I pressed , " what could possibly have led you to tell the caretaker you 'd just shot Barney if it is true that you did n't remember it ? " IIe spoke rapidly , jerkily . " All right . . . . It 's coming back ... . Barney Quill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . In fact his was the only face I saw in the whole damned place . . . . My gun . . . . I knew when I entered the barroom the clip of my Luger was loaded . When I got back to my trailer I saw it was empty . There 's a thing that pops up . . . . " He threw out his hands . " Do n't you sec ? I figured I must have shot him , that 's all . So I went and told the caretaker I had . " He paused and looked up at me like a child who 'd just recited his Christmas poem . Had he done all right ? 1 t was the only plausible explanation he could have made . " I see , " I said thoughtfully . " So that 's the way it is ? " But , old fire horse that 1 was , I yearned to be D.A . and be faced with such an answer . It would have been a pleasure to rip and dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . So far , I felt , this was the biggest flaw , the highest hurdle , to a successful plea of insanity . It , too , would take some pondering . I glanced at my watch and arose . After all I had n't fished for two whole days . " That 's enough for today , " I said . " Class is dismissed . I 'll see you again tomorrow . " " Are you taking my case ? " " I do n't know yet . Among other things , Lieutenant , there 's still the little matter of my fee . " " I was afraid of that . " I was at the sheriff 's door . " Well , I 'll see you tomorrow , " I said . " Just one more question , " the Lieutenant said . " I am your slav  --  ut only for one minute , " I said . " Shoot . " " I low arc we doin ' ? " " No more now , Lieutenant , " I said , smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll venture this : I think maybe we 're finding a way to save somebody some face . You see , saving face is one of the most important and least spoken of defenses ' known to criminal law . " " What I said to the caretaker wo n't spoil things , will it ? " " I do n't know . We ca n't have everything , chum . I 'll add only this : if the jury really wants to find you insane , wants to let you go , all hell wo n't stop ' em . Now so long . I 've got work to do . " I turned to leave . " Good night , Mr. Biegler , " the Lieutenant said . " Hope you have good fishing . " 48I wheeled around . " How in hell did you know that ? " Smiling : " Saw your rod case and gear in your ca  --  rom my cell window . I do n't think you would have left them bake all day in the sun unless you were going fishing directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy like a fox . " Thanks , " I said , smiling sheepishly . The Lecture was over . My smart lieutenant had passed with flying colors . I also suspected that at times my nimble fox might have been several jumps ahead of me. 49chapter 7 That night I slept poorly . A lawyer caught in the toils of a murder case is like a man newly fallen in love : his involvement is total . All he can think about , talk about , brood about , dream about , is his case , his lovely lousy goddam case . Whether fishing , shaving , even lying up with a dame , it is always there , the pulsing eternal insistent thump thump of his case . Alas , it is true : the lover in love and the lawyer in murder share equally one of the most exquisite , baffling , delightful , frustrating , exhilarating , fatiguing , intriguing experiences known to man . And it looked like I was rapidly falling in " love . " " Good morning , Mr. Clerk , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still registered here ? Or has he checked out ? " I had been using the same old gambit on Sulo for ten years and it never failed to convulse him . It did n't fail now . For Sulo was of the old school ; old jokes to him were like old cheese : their very mustiness seemed to make him relish them all the more . In fact I had him in stitches ; we two were bad enough to be on TV ; Sulo was the perfect straight man . " Dat 's a good one , Polly , " Sulo gasped , when he had partly re- covered . Still convulsed , be reached for his big brass key . " Ho , ho , ho . . . .  --  go get your soldier man . Ile , he . . . . You can use Sheriff 's office you like . He be out road patrol . " It was reassuring to learn that the relentless bloodhound of a Sher- iff was already abroad stamping out crime . It also gave me a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute , Sulo , " I said . " We have n't had a little visit for a long time . " I felt like an insurance solicitor coddling a hot prospect . " ' fell mc , how 's your lumbago ? " " Sure , sure , sure , " Sulo said , gratefully sitting clown under the portrait of the man coveted by the F.B.I . " Say , Sulo , " I said , before he could launch on the saga of his lumbago , " I do n't suppose you were on duty the night they brought Lieutenant Manion in ? You 're still always on days , are n't you ? " " Sure , you bet , Polly , always on days . Too old now dis night business . " " I-Im .... Lieutenant Manion wants to hire me for his lawyer Sulo . But I do n't know , I do n't know . " I pondered the problem with my old friend . " Say , what kind of a woman is his wife ? " Sulo brightened visibly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He shook 50 his head appreciatively . " Good looker , to  --  ven with dose blacl eyes . " Sulo winked and brought both arms out and down across hichest in an abrupt half-moon . " Good bumps , too . Boy , oh boy , like dat what-you-call , Maryland Monroe .... " " Why , Sulo , you old goat , " I reproved him . " And do n't be carries away . Remember what happened to Barney Quill . " I 'd lost Sulo , he was off again , drunk with laughter , and while : waited for him to collect himself I reflected what a nice thoughtfu democratic guy I was to be passing the time of day with my olc former fellow officer . And busy as I was , too . The thought gave mt a warm glow . It also occurred to me what a shabby trick it was fo : me to be sitting there trying to pump this affably innocent oh jailer . How crafty and double-crossing could a man get ? And all tcsave the skin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plain virtues , probably was n't fit to shine Sulo 's shoes . But was I doing any of it for Lieutenant Manion ? Was n't it really all for Po113Biegler ? In any case the very least I could do was to be frank witl : my old friend . Sulo had recovered and was feeling the small of his back , a sure prelude to a blow-by-blow account of his lumbago . " Look , Sulo , " lsaid , heading him off , " I 've got to ask you a question , one simple question . If you do n't know the answer I wish you 'd tell me . If youdo know and do n't want to tell me , that 's all right , too . Is that fail enough ? " " Shoot , Polly , " Sulo said soberly . " Do you know whether Barney Quill raped Laura Manion ? " Sulo surveyed me steadily with his faded blue eyes . He glancedaway and back again . " You ask me , Polly ? " he said , shrugging evasively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vy do n't you ask dat lady ? She was dere . " We sat silently . Sulo now clearly knew I was pumping him , but at least I had leveled with him . I unwrapped a cigar and chewed the end but did not light it . I had to level still more . " Do n't tell me if you do n't want to , Sulo , " I said . " I would n't want to hurt or involve you for the world . But I 've got to decide whether I 'm taking this cas  --  ' ve got to know today , this morning , in a few minutes . And if I take it I want to win it , it 's damned important to me as well as to the Lieutenant . And if I can really know that Barney raped thiswoman I think maybe I can win it . " I paused . " That 's the straight done Suln " Sulo glanced furtively around the room . " I tink maybe he did rape her , " he said quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " rap , " which , upon reflection , still did not make me quibble . " Ilow do you know ? " " Dat lie ' tcctor test say she tell da trut ' , " Sulo said . " Arc you sure , I mean about the lie-detector results , Sulo ? " I pressed . " I 've got to be sure . " " State police he tell Sheriff ; Sheriff he tell me , " Sulo said simply . " Dat 's true , Polly . I vould not tell you lie about it . " " Thanks , Sulo , " I said , briefly taking his hand . " That 's all I want to know . I feel better already , much better . I guess you can fetch down the Lieutenant now . " " Sure , sure , sure , " Sulo said , opening and clanking shut his iron door and locking himself in . He paused on the other side and regarded me thoughtfully through the bars . He smiled faintly . " T'ank you , Polly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's to be much better , much much better . " He turned and shuffled away upstairs , chuckling to himself . Good old Sulo , good old lumbago . Just as a lawyer need n't love his client to adequately represent him , so he does n't necessarily have to believe in his moral or legal innocence . But sometimes it helps , and it was helping now , and I felt greatly relieved to have had my little chat with Sulo . So the liedetectortest showed she was telling the truth , had it ? Was the prosecution going to sit on the results ? If they were , how was I goingto get them before the jury ? Especially since the results of these tests were in any'case inadmissible in court ? Well , I 'd have to face that headache later on ... . Sulo had told me more than lie realized , much more . This was , in fact , the first big break in the case . For now I not only had confirmationthat the lady had been " rapped , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story was substantially true . I knew from experience that during the polygraph test the thorough state police would have covered every detail of the case with her : the events beforethe rape , the rape itself , and the scene later at the trailer park gate where Barney had allegedly beaten her up . And that last part would absolve my man from any lingering suspicion that he had himself beaten her up in a fit of jealous rage . It further tended to buttress the truth of Lieutenant Manion 's story of his movements after his wife had reached the trailer . Now I not only knew these things were true but I knew that the prosecution also knew them . While all this still did not afford Lieutenant Manion an open-and-52shut legal defense , I now knew what the People knew and , perhaps equally important , I further knew that they did n't know I knew . It was all a little complicated and I was n't sure yet where it led . PerhapsI could lure the prosecution into trying to hide the results ... . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good morning , Mister Biegler , " the familiar mocking voice said . " Oh , it 's you , Lieutenant . Good morning . " " You seem buried in thought this morning . " I sniffed the air like a beagle . " Merely incipient coma induced bypartial asphyxia . " I arose and held my hand toward the sheriff 's door . " Shall we retire to the lilac room and carry on ? I 'll rally shortly . " " You first , Counselor , you first , " the Lieutenant replied gravely . " Ah , thank you , Lieutenant . " I had done it again to Sulo , and we left him strangling and wounded in his chair under the wanted felon . " He , he , he . . . " I was touched . Good old Sulo ; lumbago and all , he still appreciated his old D.A. " Lieutenant Manion , " I said , facing him , " I 've decided to take your ease . " " Good , good . How much is your fee ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fair enough . I rather thought it might be more . " " Maybe I 'd better raise it , then . I always want my clients to feel satisfied . " " I 'm real satisfie  --  hree thousand is most fair and reasonable . " " Good . When can you pay it ? " " It 'll have to be later . Right now I 'm broke . " " What ! " " I 'm broke . At this moment I could n't pay you three dollars . " " Can you raise it ? " " No . " " How about your trailer ? " " Both it and my car are mortgaged to the hilt . " " How about your relatives ? Everybody has a rich uncle . " " I do n't have any uncles , rich or poor . Both my parents are dead . My only close relative is a married sister in Dubuque . She and herhusband owe me money . They have four kids and a mortgage . " " You seem to spring from well-mortgaged stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did you call me down here if you knew you couldn'tpay me ? Did you think perhaps I ran a veterans ' legal aid bureau ? " 53 " I needed a lawyer and I wanted the best . " " You mean the second best , do n't you ? Or have you forgotten about that eminent authority on unwritten law , old Crocker ? " The Lieutenant shrugged and regarded me steadily . " Well , " he said slowly , " if you wo n't represent me I suppose I 'll have to try someone else . " I stared at him . Was it possible that this man sensed that by now I would almost have paid him to stay in the case ? " You let me waste a whole goddam day on this case when you knew all along you could n't pay me , " I said , trying hard to work up a pout . " You did n't ask me , " he said . ' I'hc moan had me there . He could n't be expected to know that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he wanted to enter a case . At the same time , though , I could well have probed him a little about his general financial condition when I first met him the morning before . And probably should have . Why did n't I face it ? Was n't it the solemn truth that I had suspected all along he did n't have any money , as Maida had warned me , and had deliberately put off asking him until it was too late , until I was hopelessly enmeshed ? As for Maida , how would I ever square all this with her and our depleted check book ? The thought made me smile . " Look , Manion , " I said . " Ilow much can you pay me and when ? " " I can pay you a hundred and fifty dollars on account next week . It 's pay clay then . " " Yon realize , of course , that if I accept that  --  hat I 've enlisted for the duration ? " Coolly : " Yes . That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of engaging frankness about this cool pirate . " When could you pay me the balance ? " " I do n't know . If I 'm acquitted I 'll give you a promissory note and I can pay you so much a month . " " Famous last words , " I said . " And suppose you 're convicted ? " ' Then I guess both of us lose . But is n't that just another of those calculated risk  --  ike pleading insanity ? " The needling bastard . . . . I had to put in one more try , for Maida 's sake . " Supposing I said I wo n't take your case till you pay me half my fee ? " Shrugging : " I 'd just have to regretfully get someone else , I 'm afraid . " " You 'd risk that ? " I said . " You 'd actually risk it ? " Smiling slightly : " I 've got my legal defense now , have n't I ? I was insane , was n't I ? How can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reverse . I stared admiringly at the man , at this shrewd , gambling , dead-beat son-of-a-bitch . He had me helplessly coming his way and I was morally certain that he now knew I just had to take on this case . The moment of decision was at hand ; I would either go fishing or else go to work . I took a deep breath and held it , pain and all . " Lieutenant Manion , " I said , extending my hand , " you 've got yourself a lawyer . And I seem to have a client . Now let 's get down to work . We 've plenty of it . " He took my hand . " It 's a pleasure , Counselor . Where do we start ? You 'll have to tell me , you know . Remember , I 've been ill and I 'm just recovering my wits . " " Your wits will do nicely . First let 's go out and see Sulo . I want to discuss with him the possibility of our doing our talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is getting Inc down . Even for three grand on the line I do n't think I can stand it much longer . " I held the door open for my client . We found Sulo nodding in his chair and I stood debating whether to awaken him. chapter 8The outer jail door opened and in stalked a character straight out of High Noon . His big mail-order felt hat was pushed back on his perspiring forehead ; his exquisitely tailored and stitched gabardine shirt , with its cascades of pearl buttons at the shaped pockets and cuffs , was negligently open at the tanned throat , from which depcndcdtwo cords held by a dollar-sized round silver clasp engraved not with Justice , not with Liberty , but with a bucking bronco . The richly tailored trousers were tucked carelessly into the tops of dusty hand-stitched laceless boots and all he lacked , I saw , was a Bull Durham tag dangling over his heart . " Fourscore and seven years ago , " I found myself perversely thinking , " there came forth upon this continent an ancient dust storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and hurled aloft and held magically suspended all these years . Lo ! today , may God help us , it has been dumped upon the far shores of Lake Superior . Yippee yi yi ! " It was a solemn moment and I restrained an impulse to kneel . Sheriff Max Battisfore was back at last from highway patrol . His keen gray eyes restlessly searched the room . They found mine and lit with gladness ; you could sec the very glow of gladness in them . " Well , hello , Paul , " the Sheriff said . IIe grasped my hand in both of his and looked me straight in the eye . " If it is n't my favorite ex ) . A. In person not a movie . Bow 's the old boy ? Long time no see . Is old Snlo there treating you and the Lieutenant O.K. ? " He slapped my shoulder and kept pumping nay hand . The Sheriff had conic a long way , I saw ; he had developed a boisterous and irresistiblegift for camaraderie ; he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We might belong to opposite political parties , his attitude seemed to say , but real friendship was something bigger , finer , than mere party . " How are you , anyway , you old buckaroo ? " he ran on , playfully digging me in the ribs . " I 'm fine , thanks , Max , " I said , smiling and retreating out of range . " Just fine . How are you ? " " Oh , fine , fine . Any phone calls , Sulo ? Oh , on my pad . . . . Yes , Polly , I feel just like a horse 's father . If I felt any better Sulo there 'd have to lock me up in one of my own cells . " He paused as Sulo obediently snorted . Musty cheese , musty jokes .... " Tell me , man , how the hell are you , anyway ? " 56 " I 'm fine , Max , " I repeated soberly , and , since Max 's concern over my health had been doubly relieved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute I 'd like to have a chat with you ? " " Sure , sure , Polly . Right this way . " He led the way into his office and bent over a memorandum pad on his desk . He called out to Sulo . " Phone the Missus , Sulo , and tell her I got that Community Chest kickoff dinner tonight , after that the Amvets , then bowling . .. . Shut the door , Polly , and sit down . Make yourself at home . Long time no see . Tell me , how the hel  --   --  o n't you have a ciga-rette ? " I gestured with the stub of a cigar . " No thanks , Max , I 'm still faithfully on these Italian reefers , still smoking the poor man 's mar-ijuana . " The Sheriff wagged his head . " Still the same old joker , too , Polly . Lord , it 's good to see you , man . IIow do you feel , I mean , how are you really feeling ? " " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " what were the results of Laura Manion 's lie-detector test ? " I held my lighter poised at my cold cigar . The flame burnt my finger . " Oh , that , " the Sheriff replied , without a pause . " As a foxy old D.A . like you well know  --  emember those good old days , Polly ? ? the state police made that test . They made the test , they 've got the results . " He fleetingly laid a confiding hand on my knee . " You remember how jealous they always were of their prerogatives . " He nodded sagely . " Well , Polly , they still are . Jealous as all hell . So would n't it be better all around for you to go ask them ? " Ile again looked at his desk pad . " Call operator Eleven , Detroit , " he murmured absently . He looked up . " Boy , Polly , it 's been good to sec you . Tell me , man , how the hell are you ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grudgingly admitted , standing up . " It 's their baby , I 'd better go ask them . " I paused , pondering the problem aloud . " But what 's the use of asking them ? They probably would n't tell m  --  nd anyway the results would n't be admissiblein court . " I too could confide . " I think maybe I 'll skip it , " I said resolutely . " Yes , I think I may just skip the whole thing . Only complicate matters . To hell with the lie-detector test . " I pumped the Sheriff 's free hand . He had grabbed up the phone with the other . " Thanks , Max , " I said . " Sorry to have troubled you . " " Any time at all , Polly . Long time no see . Boy , it 's been good to see you , you old buckaroo . . . . Hello , Operator , this is Sheriff57Battisfore . Give me operator Eleven at Detroit . That 's right , honey , just about an hour ago . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on for-ever .... " Max stood silhouetted against his wall of framed photographs . For the first time it occurred to me that there were no pictures showing him out pursuing felons or making an arrest , in fact none showing the man in the simple act of being sheriff . . . . I nevertheless found it an impressive scene , as though one had long read about and seen some fabulous personage in the newsreels and on TV and then suddenlybeen privileged to confront him , relaxed and friendly , in the intimate glow of his own home . One had never realized what a remarkablepersonality he was . ' There 's just one more thing , Max , " I said . " I was just going to ask Solo about it , but perhaps I 'd better ask the head man himself . I 'm in Manion 's case now and he and I are going to have a lot to talk about . " I paused diffidently . " There 'll be lots to do , too , and the trial 's just three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sheriff said . " And he 's retained one of the best lawyers in the business , Polly . The very best , for my money . " " Thanks , Max , " I said . I was finding trouble coming to the point . " Well , the county still wo n't furnish you a jail conference room and I hate for us to be cluttering up your office and being underfootall the time . I realize you have your work to do . " " Yes ? " the Sheriff said helpfully . " Well , I was wondering how about the Lieutenant and me occasionallysitting outside in my car , when your office is in use , I mean ? That way we could talk without interruption and in private and at the same time not be in your hair . " That way , too , I thought wist fully , we could occasionally breathe without pain . " Ilm. .. . " the Sheriff said . IIe pursed his lips and closed his eyes and nodded his head . " I-im . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's always his cell , Polly , " he said thoughtfully . I remained resolutelysilent . " I Im , " the Sheriff repeated , squinting again , and it was fun trying to follow his shrewd weighing of the angles , assaying of the factors , yes , counting of the very votes . What was he thinking ? Might it not be something like this ? ? Murder was a nonbailable offense , was n't it , and Manion certainly had no goddam business outside except in custody , had he ? There could be criticism , bad criticism , too , and if the damned fool skipped , made a break , it might be political suicide . But Biegler there was an old hand , an old fox , was n't he ? ? and , hm , a fairly big wheel in his party , tooand he 'd certainly warn his Lieutenant his goose would be cooked but good if he tried any funny stuff and took a powder . . . . And Polly would n't forget this favor , would he ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't he , and poor old Barney Quill was n't , and of course all that had nothing to do with the case , but .... " Hm , " the Sheriff mused , nodding his head . " Maybe I 'd better skip it , Max , " I said . " Maybe people 'd say that because you 're such an active veteran yourself you were playing favorites with war veterans . Maybe even the veterans would get down on you for taking a chance on a fellow veteran , a man who 'd dare lay a finger on a man that had maybe raped and beat up his wife . " I had delivered what I hoped was my clincher ; I paused and awaited the jury 's verdict . " It 's O.K. , Polly , " the Sheriff said quietly , almost casually . " Take him outside any time you want . He 'll be in your custody . " " No cuffs or leg irons ? " I said . " No cuffs or leg irons , " the Sheriff replied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let hi  --  either of you can afford to . " It was a shrewd analysis . " Thanks , Max , " I said . There was something big about the man ; the job of being ? and remainin  --  heriff had n't quite stamped that out . And I felt elated , elated not only to occasionally escape the jail , delightful a prospect as that was , and further elated because the Sheriff 's action tacitly confirmed the resultsof the lie-detector test , but most of all elated because this most representative citizen , this shrewd walking ( or rather patrolling ) litmus of community sentiment had virtually told me that to his mind at least the prevailing feeling was running toward my man . I was even surer of it now than if Elmo Roper had conducted a county-wide poll . And after all the jury was nothing more than a group of representative citizens , was n't it ? If Max himself felt this way about my man then why should n't they ? Yes , this was the second big break in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget this , Max , " I said , opening the door . " It 's nothing at all , Polly , " the Sheriff said . IIe craned his neck . " Hey , ther  --  ome on in , Sulo , " he shouted out beyond me . " Yes sir , Polly . Any time at all . Lord , it 's good to see you looking so fit . You 're as tanned as  --  s a hound 's tooth . " " Fishing pallor , " I said . " You 've lost some weight , too , have n't you , Polly ? You 're as lean as  --  s a ? " " Cigar-store Indian , " I said . " Any weight I 've shed , Max , " I continued , ruefully exploring the receding area over my temples , " is solely from losing hair . Time , like crime , marches on . " " You kill mc , Polly , " the Sheriff said , chuckling , shifting the receiverto his other ear and clicking the phone. 6ochapter 9It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rank August smell of Mrs. Battisfore 's flower garden , listening to the distant bumblebee hum of traffic and the drone and clatter of the trusty prisoners ( the Sheriff 's regular clients , the county 's convalescing drunkand-disorderlyset ) mowing the big sloping courthouse law  --  dly watching the sea gulls dipping and wheeling and soaring so far out over the glittering big lake . We smoked and watched silently and I reflected with lazy unoriginality that the main trouble with the world was the people in it . Someone had said it more floridly if not better : " Where every prospect pleases , and only man is vile . " " We 'll need a psychiatrist , " I said . " Why ? " " To prove your insanity . Insanity , Lieutenant , is a medical questionand for us , the defense , to create a legal issue on that score we must present expert testimony that you were insane . Once that is done , however , the issue is created and then the burden of disproving your insanity falls squarely on the People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I see , " my man said . " Then I guess we get a psychiatrist . But if it 's a medical question would n't a local doctor do equally as well ? " " No , my friend , a local doctor would n't do at all . Those boys alreadyhave their hands full delivering the population and trying to keep up with the latest miracle drugs without moving into the tangled realm of the mind . What 's more , most of them do n't know any more about it than you or I. " " You 're too modest , Counselor . Have you forgotten it was you who injected insanity into this case ? " " No , " I answered carefully . " I merely told you what the possiblelegal defenses wer  --  t was you who told me facts from which onemight conclude you may have been insane . " I saw I 'd have to chinkthat crack in my lecture and keep it chinked . " In any case , even if we were able to find any doctor hereabouts foolhardy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do to blast itwould be to throw a real psychiatrist at him and cut hi  --  longwith your insanity defens  --  o ribbons . You see , psychiatrists aresimply a different breed of cats . For example , when plain doctorsand lawyers and soldiers and similar riffraff go to a burlesque showthey go to watch the girls ' legs and tittles . But not a psychiatrist . When one of those birds stoops to attend a burlesque he goes to61watch the audience . Hell , man , you ca n't pit a mere doctor against a monster like that . " " But how would the People get to know ? " " How would they know what ? " " llow would they know whether we were going to call a doctor or a psychiatris  --  r even that we are going to claim insanity at all ? So how could they possibly be prepared to refute it ? " This client of mine was no dummy and I was glad he was n't lob- bing shells at me . " Because the law says that we must serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our intention to plead insanity , and at the same time give the names of our witnesses , ex- pert or otherwise . We ca n't keep it a secret . Surprise pleas of in- sanity are no fair , ' the law sensibly says . We 've got to tip our hand in advance . " " It 's a pretty unscientific thing , " my man said thoughtfully . " This insanity business is pretty damned unscientific . " " Why do you say that ? " " Well , we ca n't prove insanity without a medical expert , you tell me . Yet you and I have already decided I was insane , we know that we 're going to plead insanit  --  ou tell me it 's the only legal defense I 've got . And even I can see that now . In other words you a mere lawyer and I a dumb soldier have between us decided that I was medically and legally insane . Having decided that , we must now go out and shop around for a medical expert to confirm our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor wo n't do . " The Lieutenant shook his head . " It all sounds damned unscientific to Inc . " It irked me unaccountably to hear this Mister Cool so blithely undertake to criticize my profession . It was all right if a member of the family did , but for a perfect stranger . . . " Lieutenant , " I said , " the easiest thing in the world is for a layman to poke fun at the law . Lawyers and the law are sitting ducks for ridicule and always have been . The average layman may in all his lifetime collide with but one small branch of the law , which he understands but im- perfectly . Ile usually knows whether he won or lost . He may also remember that Dickens , grumbling through Mr. Bumble , once called the law an ass . So for him all the law is henceforth an ass , and , over- night , he becomes its severest critic . " " But I still do n't get it , " the Lieutenant said . " On this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass . " " Granted , " I said . " But the point I wish to make is that from this6people may not safely proceed to damn all law . You of all men should be grateful that the massive structure known as the law really exists . It so happens that it represents your only hope . " " How do you mean ? " the Lieutenant said , bristling . " I 'll try to tell you , " I said . " Mr. Bumble was only partly right . He was only part right because , for all its lurching and shambling imbecilities , the la  --  nd only the la  --  s what keeps our society from bursting apart at the seams , from becoming a snarling jungle . While the law is not perfect , God knows , no other system has yet been found for governing men except violence . The law is society 's safety valve , its most painless way to achieve social catharsis ; any other way lies anarchy . More precisely , Lieutenant , in your case the law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and seeking out and shooting up every Manion on sight . It is also what would keep the heavily mortgaged Manions of Dubuque from in turn coming a-gunning for the Quills , iii other words what keeps the fix you 're now in from fanning out into a sort of Upper Peninsula version of Hatfield-McCoy . " I paused , warming to my unfamiliar role as a defender of law . " The law is the busy fireman that puts out society 's brush fires ; that gives people a nonphysical method to discharge hostile feelings and settle violent differences ; that substitutes orderly ritual for the rule of tooth and claw . The very slowness of the law , its massive impersonality , its insistence upon proceeding according to settled and ancient rule  --  ll this tends to cool and bank the fires of passion and violence and replace them with order and reason . ' Fiat is a tremendous accomplishment in itself , however a particular case may turn out . As someone has well said , The difference between an alley-fight and a debate is law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our fine Magna Chartas and constitutions and bills of right and all the rest would be nothing but a lot of archaic and high-flown rhetoric if we could not and did not at all times have the law to buttress them , to interpret them , to breathe meaning and force and life into them . Lofty abstractions about individual liberty and justice do not enforce themselves . These things must be reforged in men 's hearts every day . And they are reforged by the law , for every jury trial in the land is a small daily miracle of democracy in action . " The Lieutenant stared at me with an amused half-smile as I soared away . " Why , just look , ma  --  ust look at Russia , " I went on . " There the law has been replaced by a stoic joyless gang of lumpy charac-63ters in round hats and floppy pants and double-breasted overcoats , men who peremptorily crack down on their Lieutenant Manions and everyone , all in the name of the juggernaut state . They are the law . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shook my head . " In fact , Heaven help us , just look almost anywhere these days . The midnight knock on the door , the whisking before a firing squad , the guttural barked comman  --  hen silence , nothing but anonymous dead silence . . . . No one even dare ask what became of you , much less defend you ; such proletarian curiosity is apt to prove abruptly fatal . " The Lieutenant was smiling now . " I did n't know you cared , " he said . " I only hope you 're half as eloquent during my trial . " I had n't quite known myself how much I cared , and I could n't help smiling . " Having said all that , Lieutenant , it remains to be added that you 're absolutely right on insanity . The present outlook and ritual of the law on legal insanity is almost as primitive and nonsensical as when we manacled and tortured our insane . I agree with you . " The Lieutenant frowned and looked concerned . " I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And supposing our chosen psychiatrist , when we find him , says I 'm not nuts ? " " In that event we keep shopping around , as you say , till we can live-trap one who does . " I shook my head . " So a-shopping we must go . I love that word . I ca n't wait to tell it to Parnell . " The Lieutenant eyed me sharply . " Who is Parnell ? " " Oh , just an old lawyer friend . My legal whetstone , I call him . " " I sec . Where do w  --   --  o shopping to find this psychiatrist ? " I thoughtfully lit a cigar . " That may be a real problem , " I said . " Either nobody in the Peninsula is insane or else all of us are nuts . In any case psychiatrists seem to shun the place . The only psychiatristsI know about are connected with public institutions of some kind : the veterans ' hospital at Iron Mountain , the prison over at Marquette , the insane asylum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of place . Most are salaried staff men and I 'm afraid we ca n't expect to get any of them . The People are much more likely to pop up with one of those . " " What do we do , then ? " " We go shopping , my friend . " The Lieutenant shrugged . " Well , I suppose if we must we must . Where do we start ? " " Not where , Lieutenan  --  he burning question is what with ? I rather suspect that psychiatrists are no more philanthropic than us lawyers . In fact less so than one foolish lawyer I happen to know . They 'll expect to be well pai  --  nd on the line . " " You 're making it rather difficult . How can I pay a psychiatrist ? You know I 'm broke . Hell , man , I ca n't even pay you . " I spoke not unkindly . " You might try helping me , that 's all . And stop feeling so goddam sorry for yourself . " I paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychiatrist . I was half hoping you might have suggested it . " " Where 's that ? " the Lieutenant said evenly . " From the United States Army , " I replied . " I do n't know whether the Army would . " " I do n't know either , but you might tell me where and who to write . It might also be well to pause here for a little review to impressyou with how serious this thing is . One , your only legal defenseis insanity . Two , to prove it you must have a psychiatrist . Three , you ca n't afford a psychiatrist . Four , then we 've got to go out and live-trap one some other way . 1 ) o you have the picture ? " " I 'll give you the name and address of my C.O. before you leave , " the Lieutenant replied . " Do n't let me forget . " " You better do it now . I 'm phoning or writing him tonight . For this , my friend , happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10As my client sat writing out the address , a woman drove up to the side of the courthouse in a black sedan . She got out and a small frisking short-haired terrier followed her , the dog carrying in its mouth a lighted flashlight , of all things . The woman wore dark glasses and as she advanced across the lawn toward us I thought for a moment it was a certain Hollywood tigress : she had the same buoyant step , the same free-swinging stride and same generous blonseful ; she had even the same mass of piled-up russet hair , the high color , the full cherry-red lips . But , no , it was n't my lovely celluloid dream queen . Before she reached my car I knew this was the woman over whom my client had killed Barney Quill . " Hello , Manny , " she said in a low musical voice . " How come you 're out here in the sun ? Did that nice Sheriff finally decide to let you go ? " " IIi , Laura , " my client said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you get the trailer moved ? " By this time we were both out of the car . " This is Paul Biegler , Laura . He 's taking my case . He 's arranged for us to talk out here . " " How do you do , Mr. Biegler , " Laura Manion said , extending her hand . She smiled ruefully . " I do hope you can help Manny out of this terrible mess I 've got him in . " " I 'll try , Mrs. Manion . If all of us do our part I think there 's a fair chance . " I sounded , I thought , a little like a professionally pessimistic football coach on the eve of the big game . There was a small thud of silence . Lieutenant Manion knelt and petted the little clog . The animal was in an ecstasy of yipping joy over seeing him . " Rover has n't seen Manny sinc  --  ince that awful night , " Laura Manion explained . " And you ? " I asked quietly . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sunday afternoon . Why do you ask ? " " I just wondered , that 's all . Just making talk . " I paused . " By the way , when can you and I talk ? " " Why , any time you wish , " she said , tilting her head . " I came here today to sec you . Now , if you like . " " The sooner the better , " I said . " Do you think all of us should talk together ? " There was a perceptible pause . She pursed her moist red lips . " Why , just as you and Manny think best , " she said. 66The Lieutenant was still kneeling , petting the dog . " What do you think , Lieutenant ? " I said . Lieutenant Manion looked up at me sideways . " Suppose you call the shot , Mr. Biegler ? Whatever you think is best . " I glanced at his wife and it seemed to me that she shook her head . " I think we two had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Do you think you can stand going back to the loving care of Sulo ? I 'd prefer to talk out here in the car . " There was another little jolt of silence , almost like that of relief . " There 's one other thing , " I said . " It seems quite likely that all of us are goingto see quite a lot of each other from now on . I 'm no particular slave to the modern cult of informality , but may I suggest that we call each other by our first names ? " " O.K. , Paul , " the Lieutenant said , rising and saluting . " I 'll leave you and Laura to talk . " He turned to his wife . " 1 ' 11 sec you later , Hon. " He started for the jail . " Come on , Rover , " he called and the little dog ran joyfully after him . Frederic and Lama Manion , I observed , had not touched each other during this encounter . I held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I closed it and then walked around and sat in the driver 's side . " Will you please remove your glasses , Mrs. Manion ? " I said . " The name is Laura , " she said . " Remember ? If you can stand what you 're going to see , I guess I can . " She removed her glasses . " Good Lord ! " I said . In my ten years as D.A . I had never seen a pair of more grievously blackened eyes , and professionally I had been exposed to plenty . " Did Barney Quill really do that ? " I caught my breath . Her eyes were large and a sort of luminous aquarium green . Looking into them was like peering into the depths of the sea . I had never seen anything quite like them before and I was beginning , however dimly , to understand a little what it was that might have driven Barney Quill off his rocker . The woman was breathtakingly attractive , disturbingly so , in a sort of vibrant electric way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there was something steamily tropical about her ; she was , there was no other word for it , shockingly desirable . All this was something of a trick , too , for a woman with two of the loveliest shiners I ever saw . I remembered something Parnell McCarthy had once said . " Some women radiate sex , " he had said . " All the others merely trade in it . " She raised her long eyelashes and regarded me solemnly , nodding her head . " Yes , " she whispered . " Barney Quill did this to me. " 67 " You 'd better put on those dark glasses , " I said wryly , feeling a little giddy . I fumbled for a cigar . " Do you mind if I smoke ? " " Not at all , " she answered in her low voice . " That 's if you 'll give me a light . " We smoked in silence for a while . " I guess the first thing I 'd better find out , " I began , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o stay , that is , and help ? " The dark glasses abruptly swept around and bored into my eyes ; I could almost see the round staring of those greenish depths . " Why how can you ask such a thing , Mr. Biegler ? " she said evenly . " Whatevermade you think I would n't stay ? " " tool : , Mrs. Manion , " I said , " I ask it because as your husband 's lawyer I have to know . You 're a key witness in this case , and if you do n't plan to sta  --  tay and help ou  --  would say your husband 's chances for beating this rap are pretty slim . I figure they 're only about fifty-fifty as it is . And you still have n't answered my question . " 1 was sorry that I had asked her to cover her eyes . I felt that about now they might be revealing to watch . " The question is , are you with him or against him ? " Laura Manion crushed her newly lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she found a fresh one and turned toward me for a light . She inhaled the smoke deeply and held it and when she exhaledit seemed to escape her like a sob . " Steady , " I said quietly . " One can never tell how a case like this will turn out . " I pausal , cautiously feeling my way , following my nebulous but growing hunch that all was not well between this woman and her husband . " One can never bank on the result of a jury trial . A key witness might go away , and a man still get off . Or a key witness might stay , and the man still go to prison . One never knows about these things . " She had listened tensely . " What did Manny tell you ? " she said . " I do n't mean about the case , but about us , about our lives together , about any plans we may have had for the future ? " Ah , so they 'd planned to separate , I thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint , not a clue , " I said truthfully . " That I swear . " " l low could you know the  --  ow can you sense ? " She broke off and again rubbed out her cigarette and turned and faced me . " Tell me , " she said , speaking swiftly , " how could you doubt but what I 'd stay and help ? Did it seem s  --  o obvious to you that there was any question that I might n't ? Tell me , please tell me . " " Why , Mrs. Manion , " I said blandly , " I 've never doubted for a68moment but that you 'd stay . It 's just routine for us lawyers to try to make sure of our witnesses . I guess perhaps I was a little clumsy and blunt about it . I 've been away from this business for a little while . " " Was it because there was no sign of affection when we met just no  --  as that it ? " Shc removed her glasses and her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said . " Yes , " she said slowly , closing her wet eyes . " Yes , I 'm staying . That 's the least I can do for poor Manny . " " Then I noticed it , yes . You knew I did and I wanted you to know I did . And if you 're staying I do n't think it will be good if too many other people notice it . This is a small watchful community , doubly alerted by this murder , and , as in all such places , nasty harmful little rumors , often baseless , have a habit of traveling with the speed of light . " I opened the car door on my side . " Excuse me , Mrs. Manion , I 've got to go speak to the jailer . I 'll he back in a moment . We 've still lots and lots to talk about . " She leaned swiftly toward me with one hand on the seat . " Not a word to Manny , " she said . " Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're talking about , Laura , " I said , smiling . " But whatever it is , nary a word . " 69chapter 11As I was leaving the jail I ran smack into the prosecutor , Mitch Lodwick , just leaving the sheriff 's office . We greeted each other and shook hands . The young prosecutor was a manly picture in tan : light tan summer suit , a pleated tan shirt and silk polka-dot tie , rich two-toned tan sport oxfords , a smart-looking waffle-colored soft straw hat with a folded tan ribbon . Then there was his tanned smiling face which made his flashing white teeth seem almost indecently incongruous . IIc looked as though he belonged more on the front porch of a country club than prowling Max Battisfore 's jail . " Well , Polly , " Mitch said , " Max just tells me you 're in the Manion case . So I guess we 're going ' round and ' round again . This one looks like a real little daisy . " " It has everything but Technicolor , Mitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a little dog . Hollywood could n't have done better . " Mitch smiled . " Alleged rape , do n't you mean , Polly ? " " I would n't know for sure , Mitch . I just got into the case and have barely met the lady . " Mitch grinned evilly . " Barely , Polly ? I hear tell in some quarters that the last man who barely met up with her died from lead poisoning . " He lowered his voice . " I was hoping I 'd run into you . " " Well , here I am , Mitch . What 's up ? " Was this , I thought , to be the word on the lie-detector test ? " It 's about a continuance , " Mitch said . " What do you say to our agreeing to continue the case from the September teen over until the December term ? We 've both got this damned Congressional electioncoming u  --  emember ? ? and I ca n't imagine your wanting to forsake your beloved trout for anv mere murder case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite likely will not be able to sit in September . I assume you 'd prefer , as I do , to have him try the case rather than gamble on some unknown grab-bag judge assignedfrom downstate . What do you say ? " I stood there thinking . I found the offer attractive on all counts , especially the desirability of having my wise old judge with whom I had worked so long , Judge Maitland . The judge in this case , I saw , was going to have to be a real lawyer , not some amiable political mountebank with a black gown and a law degree . And there were still other good reasons , too , that Mitch had n't mentioned because he was n't aware of them . If the case was continued over to the December term , would n't I also have a much better chance to insistupon , and get , a substantial payment on my fee ? The Lord knew that that was plenty important . Then there was the thorny question of lining up a competent psychiatrist and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether all this could be done ? if indeed it could be done at al  --  n time for the September term of court . There was really only one big objection to a continuance : my client himself . " What do you say , Polly ? " Mitch said . " Do we continue the case ? I did n't think there 'd be any question . " I shook my head . " No , Mitch , I 'm afraid we ca n't agree to any continuance . I 'd like to , I really would , for all the reasons you say and several more . But murder , as you know , is an unbailable offense , and I ca n't very well ask my man to sit in Max 's jail here for an additional three months simply to suit our convenience . And there 's no assurance that Judge Maitland will be able to sit even in December . In fact I for one am getting a little afraid he may never sit again . Thanks , anyway , Mitch . I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , " Mitch said , nodding thoughtfully . " Then how about copping your lieutenant out next month on second degreeand getting the whole damned thing washed up and over with ? " I shook my head . " No , Mitch , he could still get up to life for that . Too rough , too risky . He would n't stand for that and I would n't let him . But I have a suggestion . Flow about your lowering the charge to manslaughter so that I can get my man out on bail ? That way you and I will get our cherished continuance , you can go out charming the voters , and I go out alarming the trou  --  nd everybody lives happily ever after . Then before the December term we could seriously explore the possibility of his copping out to manslaughter , providing , of course , that you and Judge Maitland are sufficiently imbued with the spirit of Yuletide charity . " " No , Polly . This deal is murder or it 's nothing . You know that . Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitch snapped his fingers . " From life down to a fifteen-year max , just like that ? Ilow could I ever square that ? " " A nicely returned ball , Mitch , " I said , smiling . " But if I were D.A . and satisfied that Barney Quill had raped the Manion woman I really think I 'd seriously consider making a lower charge . " I paused . " Especially if I had a nice big fat lie-detector test , say , to back me u  --  hat 's if it did back me up . " I paused thoughtfully . " But I guess maybe I would n't lower the charge if I still thought the rape were alleged , ' as you just called it . " 70My reference to the lie-detector test had not been according to plan . But Mitch , who certainly knew the results , had just seen the Sheriff , and Max bad doubtless related our recent conversation on the subject . I waited for him to speak . Mitch blinked thoughtfully and cleared his throat . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened the outside jail door . " Well , Polly , I guess it looks like we go to work soon . You do n't go for the continuance and I ca n't go for lowering to manslaughter . " Smiling . " But what are you going to use for a defense ? 01c1 box tops ? Half the town of Thunder Bay saw your lieutenant plug Barney . " " Do n't fret , Mitch , I 'll come up with something . And as a last resort there 's always that reliable home remedy : Old Doctor Crocker 's Special Cure-all for Accused Felons . " " What 's that ? " I furrowed my brow into a Patrick Henry frown , clapped one hand across my breast and pointed scornfully at an imaginary jury . " Ladees an ' gen'emen ! " I thundered . " You cai n't guess this man into state 's prison ! Why , folks , I would n't send a yaller dawg to a dawg pound based on this here now evidence ! " " Perfect , " Mitch said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's red wig . Well , so long , Polly . " " So long , Mitch . " The jail door breathed shut on its pneumatic hinge and that , I saw , was that . Laura Manion was pacing up and down beside my car when I emerged from the jail . When she saw me she stamped out her cigarette and got quickly into the car . I had no sooner joined her than she began to talk , rapidly , breathlessly . " You 've seen Manny . .. . You 've told him , I know you have .. . and you told me you would n't . . . . Oh , why did you do it when you promised you would n't ? " She was perilously close to breaking down . " I should neve  --  ? I ? " " Mrs. Manion ! " I spoke sharply . " Please get hold of yourself . I have n't laid eyes on the man . Here , light a cigarette and calm yourself . " I twirled my lighter and held it , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Am I forgiven ? " I said . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " But you left so abruptl  --  nd stayed so long . Whatever kept you so long ? " " Did you see thatt handsome man in tan just leave the jail ? " She nodded . " Yes . Who is he ? " " He 's the old devil D.A. , Mitchell Lodwick . I 've just been talking to him . " I briefly recounted my conversation with Mitch . " So that 's what old Squealer Biegler 's been up to , " I concluded . " Am I reinstatedin your confidence ? " " I 'm sorry , Paul , " she repeated , laying her hand impulsively on my arm . " I 'm so terribly upset an  --  nd ? " " Afraid ? " I suggested . " Is that the word ? Are you afraid of your husband , Laura ? Is that the cause of the tension ? " I paused and went on . " I think I have a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't very well do my best if I 'm working in the dark . " Again she took off her glasses and looked at me , long and searchingly . I felt as though I were gliding to the bottom of the sea in William Beebe 's bathysphere . I fumbled to find a cigar and tore my eyes from hers to light it . " Yes , " she said , in a low voice . " I 'll trust you , Paul . And I 've simply got to talk to someone or I 'll explode .  --  ? " She paused and smiled . " I do n't know where to begin . " I flicked my cigar at the ash tray . " Suppose you begin with my question , " I suggested . " Are you afraid of your husband ? " When she spoke it was as though to herself . " Afraid ? Afraid ? " She turned toward me . " No , Paul , it is n't fear , precisely , i  --  t 's somethingat once more subtle and more degrading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean over a woman I cared for ? " She quickly nodded her head . " Yes , that 's what I mean . Of someoneyou really loved ? " " Mercifully no , " I replied thoughtfully . " Not ever seriously , that is , beyond occasional pangs . And that was long ago . . . . I consider jealousy the most corrosive and destructive of all emotions and I long ago made up my mind that I refused to be jealous of anyone or anything . Life is simply too goddam short . But my views on jealousy wo n't help your husband beat this murder rap and yours might . " I paused and went on . " Is jealousy at the bottom of the tension betweenManny and you ? " This was an important and possibly serious development and I had to know . She sat thoughtfully silent . " Yes , " she said slowly , " jealousy more nearly covers it than any single word . " She closed her eyes for a moment and then continued . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manny has always been jealous of me , even before we were married . I should have known how it would be . But then I found it only flatteringand protective . " She paused . " Afterwards , after we were married , I discovered ho  --  ow terrible it could be . " " We 're playing truth , now , Laura , so I wo n't beat around the bush . Did he ever have any possible reason to be jealous ? " Her answer seemed too swift , too certain , for dissembling . " No , no ! Never once . And God knows it was not for lack of opportunity . " She smiled , and her smile had about it a certain little-girl quality of wistfulness and pathos . " This thing ? " she gestured vaguely ? " whateverit is I hav  --  as always been . . . difficult . " She shook her head . " I do n't mean to have you think I do n't like gaiety and fun and flattery , " she went on . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manny apparently thinks I do . He 's jealous of any man I meet in the most casual way . In fact he 's probably jealous of you at this very monicnt . " I gave an involuntary start and for a prickly instant I could visualizea lager trained on my back . Then it occurred to me that there was always the possibility that she was gilding the lily , that , being emotionally upset and understandably distraught by her recent experience she was somehow trying to expiate her sense of guilt . I remembered suddenly that my client had the day before spotted my fishing gear in my car . My car was parked in the same place . There was one way to find out a few things , a fast and simple way . " Excuse me , " I said abruptly , and I quickly got out of my car and elaborately yawned and stretched , at the same time wheeling and glancing casually up at the jail windows . Despite the dust and soot there was no mistake : I had caught a retreating glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disappearing Army khaki . Now any poor maim had a right , I conceded , to stand and stare out of his cell window ; in fact 1 knew that some of them simply had to , like animals in a cage . But here the quick retreat had done it , had told the story ; the jealous Lieutenant stood convicted ; I now saw that this woman was probably telling me the truth . " Arc you all right ? " she inquired anxiously as I regained my place beside her . " Leg cramps , " I said wryly . " Please go on with your story . " " Well , there is n't much more to tell . I thought when Manny got assigned up here that things would be better . This was n't his regular outfit , you know . " " Were they ? " I said . " Were things any better ? " She shook her head . " No , they were worse , if possible . It justmeant a whole new strange crew of men for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really a grand person , but he 's strangling my feeling for him . How can you continue to love a man who constantlymakes you feel like  --  common street-walker ? " " Go on , " I said . I did not propose to digress any further on jealousy or the male 's reactions to it . " Just two weeks ago we attended an Army cocktail party at the hotel . Some silly half-drunk young second lieutenant I 'd never seen before kept following me around and calling me Cleopatra . He was just a boy , I suppose I could have been his mother . Finally he playfully grabbed and kissed niy hand , like an overzealous puppy . It was just one of those things all Army people experience and understand . But Manny knocked him down . That 's the last time I was ou  --  ociall  --  ntil that awful night . Why , I think he was even half jealous of Barney Quill . " I pricked up my ears . " How do you mean ? " " We 'd gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only decent place to drink in town . Barney was one of those loquacious blarney-tongued operators who 'd flatter a witch on a broomstick providedonly she was wearing a skirt . He paused at our table once or twic  --  e did the same at most of the others , to  --  nd ran out his poor little stock of complimentary banter , the same dreary sort of thing I 've heard in a hundred bars and Army posts , with or without Manny . But this time Manny went into one of his more elaborate sulks . So we quit going to Barney 's bar . " " Was there any inciden  --  ny scene ? " I asked , holding my breath . " No , thank goodness . Manny made me hurry my drink and we left . " She shook her head . " It was so utterly childish . It 's all so childis  --  nd now so tragic . And I feel so guilty . " I spoke casually . " Have you mentioned any of these things we 've just been discussing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Heavens no . I told them all about th  --  he incidents of that night , of course . I had nothing to hide . " " You are sure of this . Think back now . " " I am positive . " " Did you tell them about the sexual attack by Barney ? And all the rest , both before and after the attack ? " " In great detail . " " Did you tell all this during your lie-detector test ? " " Why , yes , of course , " she said impatiently . " Who first suggested that you take this test ? " " I did . I 'd read about them somewhere . " She incuriously studied her nails . " Do you know the results of the test ? " " No , 1 have n't given it a thought . But if the machine 's any good there could only be one result . I told them the simple truth . Heaven knows that was bad enough . " I had not meant to tell either the Lieutenant or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew the results of the lie test ; this , not only to protect Sulo but for certain reasons of my own . I now saw I would have to change my plans . " Well , you passed the test , " I said . " It showed you were telling the truth . " " Oh , " she said , with mild interest . " Did that handsome young prosecutor just tell you ? " " You see well with your dark glasses , madam , " I said . " No , the handsome prosecutor did n't tell me . I ca n't tell you how I know , but I know . There are certain trade symptoms I have learned to recognize . " One of them occurred to me as I spoke . Mitch surely knew the results of the test , and if it had been bad for our side he would certainly have told me so to aid his cause when he was making his pitch for a guilty plea to second degree murder . He had no reason then to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sid  --  nd several good selling reasons not to . Why had n't I thought of it be-fore ? " Does Manny know ? " she said . " Not yet , but I 've decided to tell him . " For it was now plain to me that 1 'd have to reassure this troubled man , and fast , or we perImpsmight not need to employ a psychiatrist or anyone to tell us he was insane ; he actually would be . " There 's one more thing , " I said . " 1 ) ou't tell a soul you know the result of this lie-detector thing . if people ask yo  --  nyon  --  imply tell them you do n't know . This may be vital . Do you promise ? " " Just as you say , Paul . And you wo n't tell Manny these things I 've just told you . " I shuddered inwardly at the thought . " Heavens no , my good woman . And do n't you . " " No , of course not , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do hope I have made you see certain things more clearly . " " I 'm beginning to see a number of things , " I said. 76She again quickly placed her hand on my arm . " Please do n't think I have said any of this to criticize Manny . Or to be disloyal . He wa  --  e i  --  o tender and good in so many ways . He 'd go through hell and high water for me . " " He might even kill for you ? " I said . She buried her face in her hands and I regretted having spoken . I was afraid she was going to cry . " Steady , Laura , " I said . " The man probably ca n't help himself . I sometimes think that jealousy is a diseas  --  sort of disease of the personality or of the emotions . I do n't know . . . . You want to help him . As his lawyer I want to help him . " I paused . " Now I must go . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must work on this case . I suggest you go put on a little scene of loving reunion with Manny for the benefit of Sulo and the Sheriff . But mostly , I guess , for Manny . I 'm getting a little worried about that man . " " Thank you , Paul , " she said . She extended her hand and I took it . " You 've been very understanding . I feel much better already . " She kept her hand in mine . " We have secrets , now , Laura , so 1 ' 11 tell you another one . I would n't have mentioned it except for what you 've told me this afternoon . " I looked down at her hand . " Your husband 's jail window overlooks my car . " She colored and withdrew her hand quickly . I got out of the car and walked around to open her door . I forced myselfnot to look up at the jail window . " Good night , Paul , " Laura Manion said , smiling . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good Army wife . " 77chapter 12That night I worked late in my office . I looked some law and wrote out a letter for Maida to sign for me and send the Lieutenant 's commanding officer , reviewing the case and its problems and puttingin an urgent request for an Army psychiatrist . Then I left a note for Maida to tell Parnell McCarthy I wanted to see him at my office late the next night . " After fishing , " I added defiantly . Then I fell into my unmade bed . " I Ii , Sulo , " I said . " Greetings from the early bird . I want to see the Lieutenant for a minute . How about my skipping up to his cell and saving a lot of commotion ? " " Sure , sure , skip away , Polly , " Sulo amiably agreed , taking down his big brass key and admitting me to the inner sanctum , the jail proper . " Three flights up , den turn right , den walk to en  --  is cell door 's unlocke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new address . " Sulo chuckled over his little joke . I managed a wan little smile as I started up the steep iron-shod stairs . " If Mrs. Manion shows up tell her to wait in my car . " As I trudged up the clanking echoing stairs winding through a maze of pipes of all kinds , water pipes , sewer pipes , steam pipes and miscellaneous brackets and girders , all clone in battleship gray , I reflected that men could apparently get used to almost anything . Thousands of men , all over the world , lived in places like this and Worse . I thought of the hundreds of uncomplaining iron miners only a few miles away who daily plunged clown into the chill and damp of ill-lit holes in the ground where for hours on end they groped their way about as through some vast insecure cheese . I thought , too , of the tiiuc I had once inadvertently wandered into the sawyers ' room of a flooring mill , while campaigning , and had suddenly been so clutched and frozen by the demented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whirling saw  --  ach presided over by a calmly oblivious workma  --  hat it was only with physical effort I had turned and fled the place in terror . Even my usually dogged zeal for votes for Biegler had failed to hold me . From a distant cell I heard an unseen player strumming softly and expertly on a guitar , accompanying a quavering falsetto voice , a voice plaintively beseeching his sweetheart to meet him on that opposite shore . I stopped and held my breath , suddenly caught andwrenched , helplessly plucked at the heartstrings , unaccountably moved by this wry mingling of sadness and comedy . I resisted an impulse to go seek out this anonymous artist , to take his hand , to beholdat last a person who did n't treat this haunting evocative instrumentas a species of drum . But there was murder to be unraveled and I must not get sidetracked . I shrugged and moved on , reflecting that I must have been a guitar-playing gardener at some Spanish hacienda during a previous incarnation . Pablo O'Biegler , no doubt . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quavering voice pursuedme . " When we meet on that opposite shore . . .. " " Hello , Polly ! " someone called from one of the nearer cells , and I recognized the wreckage of one of Chippewa 's more persistently dedicated drunkards . This gaunt alcoholic specter was gaily waving at me , as though it was I who was caught iii jail and he instead a mere passing visitor . I waved back , not very gaily , and as I toiled my way up the last flight of stairs I heard him explaining in an extravagantlyloud voice to his cell neighbor just who I was and what a hell of a hard-boiled prosecutor I had been . " But good , though . Boy ! Why , that Polly there even once sent me to prison on t'ird-offense drunk and disorderly . .. . " It was nice , I thought , to have such a grateful and satisfied customer . " Good morning , Lieutenant , " I said . My client was sitting on his unmade cot reading a newspaper , clad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his dark hair rumpledand uncombed and his face unshaven . Except for the smudge of mustache he reminded me of a photograph 1 'd once seen of Lawrence of Arabia . " Oh , good morning , good morning , " he said , quickly rising and pointing to the lone stool next to the gaping seatless toilet . " Please sit down .  --  did n't expect you quite so early or 1 'd have been ready . " He gestured at his cell . " Forgive the appearance of this-this ? " " Sty , " I said helpfully , sitting down . I had forgotten how oppressivelysqualid the cells really were . Nor had I realized that the man had carefully groomed and dressed himself for his daily sessions with me . " Here , " I said , handing him a thick book , " this may help take your mind off your surroundings . " It was Thomas Wolfe 's Look Homeward , Angel . " I hope you have n't already read it . " " Oh , thanks . Thank you very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N  --  o I have n't read it , " he said . He leaned over his cot and carefully shoved the book under his pillow , patting the78 U 79pillow to hide it . " Have n't ever heard of it , in fact . " He laughed briefly . " I 'm just a typical army type , I guess , interested only in three things : in wine , women , and war , or as I once heard a soldier say in Pusan , in beer , broads , and battle . Is it any good ? " " Good ? " I said . " Good ? " I repeated . " It was written by a ravaged whale of a ma  --  ritten with his own threshing flukes dipped in his own raging blood .. . . But I did n't climb way up here to talk of Wolfe . " I lowered my voice . " I came to tell you that your wife passed her lie-detector test . She was telling the truth . " The Lieutenant sat staring at me in tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dark eyes fluttered . Then : " Ilow do you know this ? " he said , his voice suddenly gone husky with emotion . His eyes , too , had grown narrow and slitted with craft . My hunch , I felt , had not been wrong : he had suspected her all along . " I ca n't tell you , Lieutenant , " I replied steadily . " But I know it is true . " I paused . " There is now not the slightest doubt in my mind that your wife 's story is true in every important particula  --  ncluding the rape . " The lieutenant had closed his eyes and sat , tight-lipped , shaking his head quickly from side to side . " The poor bastard , " I thought . " The poor tormented bastard . " The canker of doubt had still been gnawing at him whether it had really been rape , whether she might n't have encouraged or even solicited Barney Quill . " There 's one more thing , " I said , rising to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we know . That makes a nice cryptic sentence , does n't it ? I mean the result of this test . " I turned to go. " 1 understand , " the Lieutenant said . " You 're leaving so soon ? Oh , I suppose you prefer to wait for me below . " Ile smiled and glanced about his cell . " I would n't much blame you . I wo n't be long . " He arose and walked to the cell door . " I wo n't be seeing you until some time this afternoon , Lieutenant , " I said . " Oh , by the way , I wrote the Army last night about furnishingus a psychiatrist . I held out the tin cup and piled it on . Right now I 'm going to talk with your wife . I expect we 'll have a rather heavy session this morning . " I paused . " I would prefer that you were n't there . " The Lieutenant stood frozen in his tracks . " But you talked with her yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or over two hours . Wh  --  ? " IIe had paused , fallen silent , and stood nervously chewing his lower lip . " Yes , Lieutenant ? " I said , turning and facing him . " Have you said all you wanted to say ? Are you done ? " The man 's face was a brick-like crimson . "  --  was just thinking , " he said . I stood watching the man , wavering between scorn and pity . " Lieutenant , " I said softly , " I do n't think I 'd like to know what you 're thinking . I do n't think I 'd really like it . You 've already revealed quite enough . " I paused . " And if I may say so , it seems to me that you are in enough trouble already without dreaming up any more . Now come off of it , Lieutenant . - Please . We 've got to fight a real dange  --  his damned murder case . " I held out my hand . He still stood there frozen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower lip caught in his teeth . There was a perceptible pause and then lie took my hand . " Yes , sir ! " he said , and the phrase escaped him like a pent jet of steam . I turned and quickly left . As I clattered down the ringing jail stairs I whipped out my handkerchief and patted my forehead . The guitar had fallen silent . It seemed that I still had a client . I discovered that I was running and I slowed to a walk . Reaching the bottom I rattled the big main door like a man fleeing from nightmare . " For Christ 's sake let inc out of here , Sulo ! " I shouted . " I need air .  --  ' m suffocating . " " Do n't get your bowels in a uproar , " Sulo said , hurrying to release me fro  --  rom precisely what I did not know .. . . I stood outside the jail door , breathing deeply . Cod , it was good to be alive an  --  nd free from witnessing an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura Manion and her little dog were awaiting me . " Did you tell Manny ? " she asked eagerly before I fairly got seated . " How did he take it ? " " Did I tell him what ? " I said sharply , knowing what she meant and feeling an unaccountable prick of irritation . What kind of a pair of emotional juveniles was I getting mixed up with ? " Why , the results of the lie-detector test , of course . I could scarcely wait to ask you . " " Oh , that , " I said almost gaily , fighting back the dark mood I seemed to be in . " Yes , I told him , " I said airily . " Everything was fine , fine . I also told him to keep mum . " I paused , feeling not unlike a sort of badgered and teetering diplomatic referee , like someonetrying to promote sweetness and light , say , between the So-818oviets and the U.S.A. " Everything 's under control , " I went on . " He 's getting himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him after lunch . In the meantime I 'd like to hear your story . I want it from A to Z. Would you care to light up ? " " Do you want me to tell it just as I told it to the state police ? " " I want it just as you told it to the state police , plus , " I said . " Plus what ? " I smiled . " Plus , my dear , what you did n't tell the state police . Come now , Laura , you 're a smart woman and you 're doubtless several light years ahead of me . I want all the stor  --  lus all of the angles , good or bad . Do n't you see , if you do n't tell your lawyer what he may have to face and fight ? " " Where shall I begin ? " she said , smiling . " Suppose , " I said , " suppose you begin at A. " 82chapter 13 " I had ironed most of the afternoon , " Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Manny had got home from the firing point a little later than usual , about six o'cloc  --  mean the night of the shooting .

" I think he 'd stopped off at Barney 's bar with some other officers and had a round or two of drink  --  e was sleepy and hungry . " " Was he drunk ? " I said . " Oh , no , just so-s  --  ust relaxed , merely a pleasant glow . " " I see , " I said . " Did you tell the police about that ? ? I mean about his sleepiness , about the pleasant glow ? " " I did n't tell them and they did n't ask inc . " " Very well , " I said . " Go on . I 'll try not to interrupt unless I have to . " Laura Manion went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dinner ; then he had eaten ; then he had taken another nap . Later he had awakened and asked for a highball , but there was no whisky in the trailer ; then he had wanted sonic beer , but there was no beer . Laura Manion had suggested that they go visit Barney'sbar but Manny had grunted and turned his face to the wall . " And what were you doing all this time ? " I said . " Being frightfully bored , " she replied . " I had n't been out of that damned trailer in over a week , except to shop . It was beginning to feel like a cell . " " Cleopatra , " I thought . " Imprisoned Cleopatra chained to the ironingboard of a mortgaged trailer . " There was something faintly incongruous in the picture . " Go on , " I said . Manny had again fallen asleep . A full moon had swum up out of Lake Superior , sifting through the pines surrounding the trailer . It was a gorgeous summer night and for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally awakened Manny and told him she planned going to the bar at the hotel to get some beer . Would he like to go along ? Manny had yawned and thought no , but said he might join her later . Then he had fallen asleep again . This time he had begun to snore . He had sounded , she thought , " like a missing outboard motor . " Laura had listened to his snoring as long as she could and then she had called her little dog Rover and taken her flashlight and walked83up to Barney 's hotel bar , taking the path through the woods . That was her regular route to town , much shorter than going by the road . She thought it had been shortly before nine o'clock , she could n't exactly remember , anyway it was getting dusk . She must have got there in about ten minutes . Barney 's hotel bar was almost deserted , there were only a few customers , and those mostly locals . No , there were no Army people . There might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist park where the Manions stayed was quite full ; it was that time of the year . ' Tourists to the right of us ; tourists to the left of us .... " The only others in the bar were the bartender , whose name was Paquette , she thought , and a blonde waitress called Fern something or other , she was n't quite sure of her last name , perhaps Malmquist or Youngquist , something like that . We certainly had some rather odd names up in this neck of the woods , did n't we ? " Yes , " I admitted . " Up here Smith is an odder name , however . And where was Barney Quill ? Was n't he there when you arrived ? " " No , he did n't appear until later . I ordered a highbal  --  y regular drink , a bourbon and tall wate  --  nd then I went over and played the pinball machine . " " Pinball ! " I said , recoiling in horror . Somehow or other I could n't quite visualize this beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked her incredulously . She smiled , defiant in her waywardness . " I love to play pinball , " she said . " I guess I 'm funny that way . " " You share your neurosis with millions , " I said , shaking my head sadly . " Why there are even some people who love to square-dance ? square-dance to hill-billy music sung through the left nostril . I have beheld it with these tired old eyes . " " An Army wife has to find some way to pass her tim  --  nd still stay an Army wife , " she said . " Anyway , I love it . " " Co on , " I said wearily . She had gone on playing pinball ; there was no escape from it ; more lights had lit , more bells had rung , still more colors and numbershad flashed and cascaded , the machine was wracked with more tremors and seizure  --  nd she had gone on playing pinball . Then Barney Quill had appeared quietly at her side and challenged her to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had played and she had won the first game . Yes , Fern had served them their drinks over at the machine . " This Barne  --  hat shape was he in ? " I said . " How did he act ? Did he seem to be drunk ? Did h  --  id he make any kind of a play for you ? " " He appeared sober to me . And I must say he acted like a gentleman . In the place , that is . There was no suggestion of any play " ? she paused and smiled ? " and from long experience I think I 've grown fairly sensitive to all the signs . " " Yes , I suppose . Did the police ask you about this , too ? " " Yes . And I gave them the same answer , because it was true . He was friendly and courteous , no less and no more . " " Go on , " I said . " When did you finally wrench yourself away from the hypnosis of pinball ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had had some of their drinks at the bar . During the evening she had had three or four highballs ; she was quite sure it was not more than four . No , she was not intoxicated , just feeling relaxed and enjoying herself , perhaps about like Manny had felt when he had conic home for supper . Then she had noticed it was nearing eleven so she ordered her six-pack of beer and made ready to leave . It was then that Barney suggested that he drive her back to the trailer . Yes , he was still courteousbut she had thanked him and declined , saying that with her flashlight and dog Rover she would make it all right walking . Barney had then warned her that there were a lot of strange charactersfloating about the town at that time of the year and that he felt it was his duty to see the Lieutenant 's wife safely home . And then he had mentioned the bears . " Bears ! " I said . First there was pinball , now there were bears . Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " It seems that nearly every evening the black bears move in to scavenge the village and trailer-park garbage dumps . I remembered that Manny had mentioned seeing a bear one night while driving along the main road . Then I recalled that one of our soldiers had wounded one only the week before . " " What did you do ? " " Well , by that time I was of half a mind to ride with him but I knew that Manny did n't like Barne  --  r any man that was nice to me , for that matte  --  o I again declined and thanked him for the pleasant evening . I then went back to the rest room , back beyond the pinball machine , to tidy up so that when I was ready to leave I could slip out the side door of the bar without further notice . " " I understand , " I said . Laura Manion had lighted her flashlight when she emerged from84 85the rest room and given it to Rove  --  e carried it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nd she and Rover had slipped out of the side door as she had planned . " What happened then ? " I said . Someone standing in the shadows had said " Psst ! " and come forward . It was Barney . He had the motor of his car running and he again asked her to let him drive her home ; once more he expressed his concern over the anonymous characters and the bears . " What did you do ? " I said . " Well , it seemed frightfully dark outside after the brightly lit barroom . And , foolishly as it turned out , I was growing more afraid of possible strange bears than of any strange men . It also struck me as ungracious and rather insulting for me to continue to refuse him . I t seemed much easier to let him drive me hom  --  t was so close . So I consented and Rover and I got in his car , Rover sitting between us with his flashlight . " " Go on , " I said . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to the trailer park . It 's only a short way beyond the footpath I had taken earlier while coming to the hotel . When he turned in toward the tourist park I remember feeling a little silly for having refused a ride so lon  --  or there he was , driving me straight home , just as he had promised . " " Proceed , " I said . " There is a little stretch of heavily wooded road just before you get to the boundary of the tourist park , the main entrance . When we got there I saw a gate closed squarely across the road . I had never seen it before . " " What happened then ? " " As I started to open the car door and thank him for driving me home he laid his hand on my hand or ar  --  ot forcibly , just lightly ? and told me that he had forgotten that the caretaker locked the gate at night ; that he knew of another little road into the park that had no gate and would not be closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( lusty going through the fence and walking the sandy road , he 'd gladly take me the other way . With that he backed the ear swiftly out to the main road and shot it into forward gear and drove away down the roa  --  n a direction still farther away from the hotel bar . " " Up to that time had you felt any particular sense of alarm ? " " No , none whatever . " " All right . Then what happened ? " " He drove rapidly down the road and then turned abruptly off the main road onto a strange narrow two-rut road to the right and away from the tourist park . That was the first time I had any feeling that things were not right . I said , ' Barney , where are you going ? ' Instead of answering me he grabbed my arm , tightly this time , and kept driving furiously . I do n't know how far we drove . Suddenly he stopped the bouncing car and turned out the lights . By that time I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out , but he dragged me back in . He was terribly strong . Then Rover the dog started to whine and Barney opened his door and threw him out . All the while he had n't spoken a word . I could n't see a thing , but I could hear Rover whimpering outside . " " Go on , " I said . " Then Barney got close up against me , very close , and said in a hoarse wild voice I could scarcely recognize that he was going to rape me . " " He used that word ? " " That 's the very word he used . Then lie said I 'd better come acros  --  hat was also his expressio  --  r I 'd never get out of the car alive . All the while he was pawing away at me , trying to get at me , and I was trying to fight him off . " " Up to this time had you screamed ? " " No . I guess I sensed it was no use ; it seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marooned in the middle of a jungle . And I was growing terribly afraid now that he might kill me , as he had threatened . " " Go on . " " All the while he kept clawing at me and beating me on the knees with his fists , a regular tattoo . I had my knees clamped together . I felt myself growing weaker . Finally I said : ' If you do this to me my husband will kill you . ' " " You told him that ? " I said , wincing my eyes shut . " Yes , I was getting desperate and I thought by saying that I might scare him off and bring him to his senses . And furthermore I meant it . " This opened up certain glum vistas ; vistas , I saw , that should mightily please an alert prosecutor . But now was no time to get into that . " What happened then ? " I said . " My saying that only seemed to make him worse , if anything . He laughed , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cackling soundand said Manny would n't have the guts to kill him ; that he , Barney , was one of the best pistol shots in Michigan , in the Midwest , anywhere ; that he was a whiz at Judo and I do n't remember what all , and that lie could take on a dozen Army guys like Manny with one arm tied behind his back . He ranted on like a madman . It seemed he was just about the best there was at anything . " " INC I said . " Interesting , very , very interesting . Go on . " " I again said that if he did that to me Manny would kill hi  --  e were struggling all the time , remembe  --  nd with that he suddenly crouched away from me and hit me with his fist . Hard . He swore at nu . ' Take that , you goddam Army slut ! ' is one of the things I remember he said . I almost lost consciousness . I felt something ripping as he tore off my panties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept clawing and beating away at my knees like a maniac . I was practically out . I could hear the dog whimpering and crying outside , scratching at the door . " I was watching her closely during this recital . She did not sigh or weep or hesitate ; rather she told her story as though she were tryingfaithfully to recount some bad dream . " And then what ? " I said . " Well , finally I knew he wa  --  ell , he had succeeded , he was gettinghis way . " " You 're sure of that ? " " A woman does not mistake these things , Paul . I still ache from the man ; I did not want him ; I was .... Surely you understand all this .... " " Go on , " I said , nodding . " Iie was like a raging beast . I did not fight any more . In the first place I could n't any longer ; anyway it seemed better to have this awful nightmare over with . I lost all track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't at me , that Rover was back beside me , that the car was moving once again . I must have partly fainted . All I wanted then was to get away from this madman . It seemed as though he wanted to rend something ; to tear it apart . " " Did either of you speak ? More than you have recounted , I mean ? " " No , no other words were spoken . Barney was breathing deeply , almost like a dying man , a hideous guttural noise between a sob and a moan . It was the eeriest sound I have ever heard and was in a wa  --  his may sound terribly odd to yo  --  ne of the worst partsof my experience . It was as though he was about to cry , to break down .... " She shook her head . " I still hear it at night . " " Go on , " I said . " Finally we were out on the main road . Then I saw we were again nearing the locked gate . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time that Barney grabbed for me . I could n't get out . He wanted to take off my sweater . . . . Then he wanted me to totally undress . We 'd try it that way , he said . He was like a madman , all the time plucking away trying to rip off my sweater . By this time the car had to stop or it would have hit the gate . I somehow again opened the car door and Rover leapt out . His flashlightwas still burning . Barney still had hold of me . He 's going to kill me , ' I thought . I suddenly gathered myself and somehow wrenched away from him and ran . I could see Rover with his light running furiously back and forth between an opening in the fence . I ran towards him , towards the light . " " Did you get through the fence ? " " I do n't really know . Barney was suddenly upon me . He tripped me and kicked me and then fell on me . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my face and body , repeatedly . I swear he was trying to kill me . I felt myself fainting , I was nearly out . That was when I screamed . I screamed two or three times with all my might . Suddenly I discovered that I was alone , running , following Rover and his light , running towards our trailer . I tripped and fell and got up agai  --  do n't know how many time  --  ut always I kept running toward the light . " " You saw no more of Barney ? " She closed her eyes and shook her head . " No . I never laid eyes on him agai  --  live or dead . " " Go on , " I said . " As I got to the door of our trailer Manny was just coming out . He seemed only half awake . He told me later he 'd dreamed I was screaming and woke up . I fell into his arms . " I looked at my watch . " Do you want a rest ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " If she did n't , I did . " No , no , " she said , and then she smiled . " But perhaps you do . " " I think I 'll take a five , " I said . " In the meantime you can collect your thoughts . " 88 89chapter 14 " If you do this to me Manny will kill you , " Laura Manion had said . And she had been right ; she had known her Manny and Barney had n't . Barney had " done that " and Manny had had the guts , all right ; lie had marched out and killed Barney . The reaction had been as starkly primitive and elementa  --  es , and as inevitabl  --  s holdingone 's hand over an open fire : perforce the hand would be burned . If Manny had been insane that night then Barney himself must have been stark raving mad . In fact the certainty that something had would happen to him if he raped Laura Manion cast the biggest doubt on her story . What in hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did but half of what she claimed ? Had the man been trying deliberately to destroy himself ? Who was this guy Barney Quill ? What was his trouble ? I saw I still had lots and lots of work to do ; that there were still many baffling questions in this weird case . " Manny will kill you , " she had said . The fateful phrase buzzed like a gnat in my ears . And as the defense lawyer I did n't pretend to like it . But my hands were tied ; there was nothing I could do about it ; the fatal words had been uttered . I shook my head . Lawyers were something like actors , I reflected : their range was limited by the play ; they had to take the script as they found it ; they dared not change the words or tinker with the dialogue . When they did they became either ham actors , on the one hand , or else shysters . What Laura Manion had said was natural enough , Heaven knows , but I was sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have let her say what she had said . For one thing , in one breath did n't it take a lot of wind out of the sails of our insanity plea ? Did n't this revealing warning she had given Barney tend rather to stamp the act as a deliberate killing done in a fit of murderous retribution and revenge , just as she had predicted ? And had she told the police what she had told Barney ? Perhaps even more important , had she told Manny what she had told Barney ? Had she in effect suggested to her husband that he go out and dispatch the doomed and waiting Barney ? Well , I would find out very soon . " Laura , " I said , beside her in the car once again , " did you tell the police about warning Barney that Manny would kill him i  --  fhe molested ' you , as our family newspapers love to call rape ? " " Yes , yes , of course . I told the police everything that happened , 90everything I could recall that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , of course . " I proceeded calmly . There was no use in my uselessly scaring her . " And did you also tell Manny what you 'd told Barney ? " I held my breath as I awaited her answer . " Yes , he was the first one I told , " she replied . My heart sank . This could be a serious development in the case , not only marring the effectiveness before a jury of our claim of insanitybut possibly the even more important question of whether a reputable psychiatrist would now ever find insanity at all , in view of it . Well , I had better get all the bad news at once . " And did you also tell the police that you had already told Manny ? " I asked . " Yes , " she replied , and my spirits sank even lower . " I told Manny about it on the way driving in to the jail . ' I'hc officers undoubtedly heard me and anyway I told them again later . " My spirits soared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugged her . " You mean , " I said , " that the first time you told Manny was after the shooting ? ? not before ? " My mounting concern and sudden relief had been totally lost on Laura . " Why , yes . I never thought of telling him before , " she replied easily . " I guess I was afraid , too , that Manny would do just what he did do . I knew the man . . . . Anyway , things happened so fast . . . . " " What were you wearing that night ? " I said , veering abruptly away from this troublesome subject . " Were you dressed as you are now ? " Looking again , I was somehow hopeful she was n't . But then , had n't she already mentioned wearing a sweater ? " Well , " she said thoughtfully , " I had on a sweater , one very much like this " ? I winced inwardly ? " and a skirt and a slip and panties . " " Any girdle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I never wear the things . " " These . . . panties that Barney tore of  --  ho has them now ? The police ? " " I 've never seen them since . We gave the ripped skirt to the police . The next day the police drove me and Rover in to the spo  --  hey apparently determined it by some fresh tire burns nearby on the grass where Barney had evidently turned around , and also by the way poor Rover whined and carried on at that place " ( she reached over and affectionately patted the dog as she spoke ) , " but they never found my panties though they scoured the woods all around91the place . All they found were my glasse  --  till intact , thank good-ness . " " Glasses ? " I said . " You mean to tell me you were wearing glasses through all this ? " " No , not wearing but carrying them in their case . I 'd been holdingthem in my hand and in the struggle with Barney when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have dropped them . " " Why are n't you wearing them now ? " I said . " Well , right now I 'm afraid I still need my dark glasses . " She laughed her rich chuckling laugh . " Anyway I only use them for reading or anything close up . I had used them to play pinball that night . " She again laughed . " I 'm surely glad they found the  --  ca n't even read a headline without my glasses . " " Glasses ! " I mused . Another small score for our side . It was going to be hard at best , I saw , to tone down this concupiscent-looking creature , but I would have to make the try . However she might despisewearing a girdle she was damned well going to have to wear one at the trial . I 'd have to remember to tell her . " I seem to recall that you or your husband mentioned something about moving your trailer , " I said . " What was all that about ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thunder Bay down to a small private trailer lot in Iron Bay , " she said . " First of all , I wanted to get away from tha  --  hat place " ? she paused ? " and also get away from the tourists and curiosity seekers . Ever since that night they have surrounded the place , almost day and night , it seemed , as though I were some kind of two-headed monster . I was in a state of siege . Every time I dared go out the door , there they were , owlishly staring at me or boldly asking that Rover and I pose for their cameras . Some were even bold enough to want to discuss the details of the case with me . I 've never seen such an exhibition of morbid prying curiosity . " She shook her head. ' ' the price of fame , madam , " I said . " But you have n't seen anythingyet . Just wait till the trial . You will discover that morbid curiosity is not confined solely to tourists . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yo  --  ou think the trial will be crowded ? " she inquired anxiously . " Solidly , " I said . " The case has everything . Rape , murder . Even a little dog . " But I saw the look of " courtroom fright " overtaking her again so I swiftly changed the subject . " Did you tell the police substantially the same story you have told me , up to now ? " She nodded . " Yes , practically the same . " She shrugged and laughed . " I had to . That 's the way it was . " " Well , " I said . " You have told it very well , well and effectively . It has the ring of truth . I only hope you can do as well in court . " " Thank you , Paul , " she said . " I 'll certainly try . " " There 's one more thin  --  n important thing . " " What 's that ? " she said . " You understand of course that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get to question you when I am clone ? " " Yes , I supposed that he would . They always do in the movies , do n't they ? Wagging their fingers and all ? " " Well , he may try to shake your story , or confuse you , or try to bring out things that we might not ourselves particularly like to bring out . I can not now predict what they might be . But do you follow me ? " She nodded . " What I want to impress upon you , " I continued , " is to at all times tell the truth . I think that so far you have been , but Mitch ? I mean the prosecuto  --  ay try to draw things from you , possibly new things , that in your natural confusion or desire to help you may feel are better to hide or soft-peda  --  r even to lie about . " I paused . " Do n't do it . When in doubt tell the truth . It 's the best little confounder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . Now I 'll try to keep Mitch from roaming too far afield , but the latitude allowed in cross-examination can be deadly and Mitch may nevertheless try to give you a bad time . " Laura shook her head . " Why should he try to do that to me ? And he looks so open and fran  --  o nice and kindly , too . " " He may try it to shake or cast doubt on your story of the rape . The brutal fact of this rape is his big problem in this case and he will know it . Do n't you see , Laura , if he can keep pecking away at you and lower your guard and get you to tell some silly little untruthon some minor point , and then later in rebuttal or in some other way demonstrate that little lie of yours to the jur  --  f he can do that , then maybe he can cast a doubt on our big trut  --  he bitter and otherwise unescapable truth of the rape . Do n't you see ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I see , Paul . But why should he try to shake my story on the rape ? He already knows that I told the trut  --  e has his own liedetectortest to tell him that . " I laughed , a little cynically , I 'm afraid . " Dear woman , " I said , " a92 93lawyer in court trying to win a big case is like a newspaper man sitting on top of a big scoo  --  e 's not to be trusted . Never . At such times a lawyer would betray his own grandmother . So help me , I 've clone it myself . In fact I used to be quite a little bearcat at the business . " Slic shook her head . " How utterly sordid , " she said . "  --  thought the law was above that . . . . How can a lawyer possibly try to twist and pervert what he already knows to be the truth ? " " We lawyers quickly develop a protective scar tissue to take care of that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is our lofty conviction , hugged so dearly to our hearts , that our cause is basically just and right and that those on the other side are just a pack of lying and guilty knaves . " I shook my head . " It 's merely the same old dilemma of man in a new guise : that supposed noble ends can ever justify shabby means . Mitch will tell himsel  --  nd with considerable force ? that even if Barney did rape you , it gave Manny no legal justificationto kill him . So the man must be guilty . From there it 's only a small jump , a mere breeze , to convincing himself that the ultimatetruth or falsity of the rape does n't really matter . Do n't you see ? " " I 'm afraid I do , " Laura Manion said , nevertheless shaking her head dubiously . I was growing afraid that I had told her too much too early and had maybe built up in her what lawyers call " court fright , " the legal version of mike fright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television . But it had to be done ; it would be no easier if I sprung it on her just before the trial ; and this way she could perhaps at least have time to ponder and learn to live with her burden . " Do n't let the prospect get you down , Laura , " I said . " All you have to do is open those big eyes of yours wide and tell the truth . I can see that comes naturally to you anyway , and here we must make sure that nobody tells any small untruths so that we can protect our big truth . I hope I can cuff the prosecution all over the lot with that . So let 's not weaken our rape story to gain any small temporary triumphs . " It was refreshing , I reflected , that legal strategy and the truth could occasionally walk gaily hand in hand . " Thank you , Paul , " she said , touching my arm briefly . " I 'll open my eyes real wide and just let the truth flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really want to win this case , do n't you ? " " Did n't you know , madam , " I said , laughing , " that I too am con-94vinced of the justice and right of our cause ? The prosecution is nothing but a pack of lying scoundrels . You see , it 's an occupational disease of us lawyers . " I glanced at my watch . It was nearing the lunch hour . And I could sec Mister Cool padding restlessly up and down his cell , peering anxiously out of his sooty window , drilling my back with his smoldering ( lark eyes . " Speaking of your big wide eyes , " I continued , " I want you to go find a photographer today and have your black eyes photographed in all their glory . And all your bruises , too . ' They 've faded out some even since yesterday . To make sure have him take at least two shots of each pose . When this thing 's all over , I 'll give you a set to place among your souvenirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him first . I do n't want him playing up your bruise  --  hey scarcely need tha  --  ut I also do n't want him to go artistic on us and play them down . As a class these picture men have a weakness that way ; they seem to want to make everyone come out looking like week-old albino rabbits . I 'm a Mathew Brady man myself . And do n't you go and try to look glamorous . " I got out of the car . " Then conic back over here when you 're done . I want to hear the rest of your story . " " It shall be clone , Paul , " Laura Manion said , laughing . " And I promise to look like a perfect witch . " " That , madam , " I said gallantly , " will take a bit of doing . " 95chapter 15If clients and witnesses sometimes suffer from courtroom jitters , lawyers themselves occasionally come down with what might more clumsily be called " preparation-of-the-case " jitters . That noon while I ate lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminarytwinges in myself . The symptoms are subtle and rather hard to pill clown ; I seemed suddenly gripped by a feeling of unreality about the case and its possible outcome , a wry sensation of inadequacyand doubt , a notion that I was somehow missing the boat ; an anxious feeling that I had got so close to this damned case that I could n't see the forest for the trees . I also discovered that I was holding an uneaten sandwich poised in mid-air . I abruptly took a big bite into it and one or two of my fellow diners glanced quickly in my direction , as one does when a creep is abroad . " Wrong order , " I muttered in a sandwich-muffled voice . " Place goin ' plumb to hell . " Tentative trial strategies which seemed inspired from on high were now crowding in and colliding head on with still other but inconsistent strategies which had seemed no less brilliant at birth . It was high time , I reflected , that I get to hell away from the turbulent Manions and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case itself . From there on it was only a breeze for me to decide to go fishing . I sighed and pushed my unfinishedsandwich away and went upstairs and phoned the county jail . " Is this you , Sulo ? " I asked , as though there was anyone else in the whole wide world who could say " Iron ' Liffs County Yail speaking " with half the Old World charm of Sulo . " This is Polly Biegler , " I went on . " Look , Sulo , please tell the Manions that I 've been unavoidablydetained and wo n't be able to see them this afternoon . " " You been wat ? " Sulo shouted , and it came back to me that he had always shouted over the phone ; he was one of those resolute diehards who would never quite believe that such gadgets were here to stay . " Look , Sulo , tell my Army man I wo n't be there today . Yes .. . I mean no . . . I wo n't be there . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't be there ! I 'm sick , I 'm going fishing , I 'm drunk ! I wo n't be there ! " " Sewer , sewer , sewer , Folly , " Sulo said mildly . " Vy do n't you tell me dat in da first ' lace ? You vo n't be over here today . " " Good-by , Sulo , " I said . " I love you madly . " " Vat you say ? " Sulo shouted . " I wo n't be there ! " I shouted back , closing my eyes and resting the receiver gently on its cradle . Yes , it was about time to go fishing . But it was still too early and far too bright for good fishing so I ordered a bottle of beer and picked up an outdoor magazine and idly thumbed the pages . The mosquito-infested crisp-bacon world of outdoor sportsmen , I saw , was this season fast going to hell in an outboard motor . Tucked away between the jungle of ads I found an article on a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as one sometimes macaberly reads the obituaries of complete strangers . The incongruity of my reading about bass or bass fishing , which I loathed , reminded me of the time my friend Raymond and I had once , on a fishing tip , visited the shack of old Dan McGinnis , the king of Oxbow Lake . Danny lived by himself ? " batched " in the U.P . idio  --  n one of the wildest and remotest areas of the county . One had to walk the last several miles to get there ; not even the best jeep could quite negotiate that bush country . We had found old Danny sitting by his window , patched elbows propped on his checkered oilcloth-covered kitchen table , poring over a tattered old pulp magazine . His lips were moving silently as though he were recitinga litany . So absorbed was he in his reading that he barely looked up when we stomped in and dumped our packsacks and fishing gear on his floor . " What are you reading , Danny ? " Raymond had politely asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up . " Why , I 'm readin ' a story about a kind of a hermit fella what lives ' way up in the north wood  --  ll by hisself . He 's slowly goin ' crazy , it says here . Livin ' all alone all year ' round . Can you imagine the likes of a pore crazy bastard doin ' that ? Unnatural , I calls it . Yep , yep , yep . Damned int'restin ' , though ! " And there I now sat , in the heart of some of the finest trout fishing in the country , reading an article designed to teach poor trapped city guys and Indiana farmers how they might catch more wormy bass , a fish that I personally regarded as scarcely a cut above a chain-store lobster . I slammed shut the magazine and stalked out of the place and down the street to Doc Trembath 's office . The Doctor 's office was crowded as usual , and as usual mostly with glowering and stoically pregnant women , who were his specialty ; but Doe 's receptionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own pregnancy was more advanced , and in a few minutes I was seated beside the doctor himself , an enormousbig hulking field marshal of a man with the gentle long-sufferingmien of an overworked angel . " I 'm defending the Manion murder case , " I said , shaking his big paw , " and believe it or not I need some advice on the mechanics of sex . I low the mighty are fallen . Please try to give it to me straight ? not iu the pig Latin you doctors ordinarily use . " " Fire away , " Doctor Trembath said , sighing wearily and lighting a cigarette . " You 've doubtless read about the case in the papers , including the fact that Manion 's wife claims that Barney Quill had raped her , " I said . " Yes , " the Doctor said . He was a quiet sort of man , and he rarely wasted words . The women adored him ; a sheer case of the attraction of opposites . " Well , the lady in the case , Laura Manion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now living with her second husband . Could a doctor tell by examining her whether she had been raped ? " The Doctor slowly shook his head no . " Or that she had recently had intercourse ? " " Only if a smear showed spermatozoa . " " The Manions tell me that old Doc Dompierre tilted her up over at the jail the other night , at their request , and took a smear with a swab stick . He has since reported it was negative for male sperm . " " Did he first dilate th  --  aginal opening ? " Doc asked , mindful of my warning against medical Latin . " The Manions say no . But is the way he did it kosher ? " " That is not the way I would have done it , " the Doctor said . " But is it one medically accepted way ? " I persisted . " No , " he said . " I would say it is definitely not . " " If it appeared that the lady was excessively tender and sore ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcibly had ? " The Doctor looked up at the ceiling and blinked thoughtfully . " I would rather put it this way , " he said , speaking carefully . " The symptoms you speak of are purely subjective , so a physician could not himself testify as to her pain and soreness . There would thus be no direct physical evidence of a rape or indeed of any act of intercoursethat he could testify to . But if the woman 's claim as to such soreness were true and also her claim that it was the result of an unwelcome act of intercours  --  f her story was believed , in otherword  --  careful physician could testify that this was some evidence that the intercourse had been against her will . " He paused and smiled faintly . " I suppose I do n't have to tell you that a normal woman has to be receptive to the ac  --  he has to be ready . I further understand that among you lawyers the woman 's unwillingness is an important element of legal rape . " " Right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so testify if you were asked in cour  --  hat her sensitivity could have been the result of intercourse against her will ? " He thought for a moment . " I would want to examine her first , " he said . The good Doctor had led with his chin . " Good , " I said . " When can you look her over ? " The Doctor grunted and gestured wearily at the roomful of waitingfemales . " Another one more or less wo n't make much difference , I guess . " He sighed . " Sometimes I wish I had taken up stcamfitting ? some trade where I could just throw down my wrench and walk away when the whistle blew . " " Perhaps , Doctor , " I said , " perhaps your world view is growing a trifle too confined . " He smiled wanly . " When do you want to scud her in ? " " How about this afternoon ? " " I suppose . Yes , send her along . " " Will you also check her for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please make notes of v our findings ? " " Yes , yes . Send her along . " " Thank you , Doctor . Now just one more question : Is there any way that an autopsy on Barney Quill could have shown that he had had intercourse shortly before his death and reached a climax ? " " There is . " " How ? " " By possible stains on his body or clothing , and better yet by examination of the seminal vesicles , which would naturally be deplete  --  hatis , if he had recently reached a sexual climax . Here , I 'll show you . " He reached over and selected a thick medical book and flipped the pages and showed me and explained a picture of the complicated things that happen to the human male as he embarks on love 's last embrace . " Ah , nature , it 's wonderful , " I said , when he was done . " But I think that henceforth I 'll stick exclusively to fishing . " " May I ask if an autopsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I assume so , " I said . " That 's the only sure way the People can prove the cause of deat  --  hich is part of what we lawyers call the corpus ( Midi , you know , if you 'll excuse my foreign accent . " " Was an examination made of the body and clothing for the things we 've just discussed ? " " That 's exactly what I do n't know , Doc . That 's one of the reasons I came to see you . " I had come to the hard part , and I paused . " Would you have any objection , Doctor , to testifying for the defenseon these thing  --  f it should become necessary ? " I said . " In fairness I should add that it probably will become necessary . " ' 1'hc Doctor sat pondering and puffing his cigarette . Here was a grievously busy man , one of the busiest and best in the county . Yet could I much blame him if he shied away from getting mixed up in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trembath , prominent Iron Bay physician and surgeon , today testified for the defense ! " the newspapers would proclaim . And he would naturally anticipate all that . " Doc , " I said softly , rising , " this Lieutenant of mine ? ' way up here among stranger  --  e 's a pretty goddam lonely man . And he 's stony broke , too . I 'll try to find someone else i  --  f you 'd rather not help . " The Doctor crushed out his cigarette and arose and extended his hand . Tall as I am he towered over me . " If the going gets too rough , " he said , " you can count on me . " " Thank you , Doctor , " I said . " I hope no one 's popped out there while we 've been talking . " The stoically pregnant women seemed to glower harder than ever as I , the interloping male , one of the hateful carefree breed responsiblefor their plight , stole through their swollen ranks and clattered down the stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical secrets I now knew about their husbands and lovers . And anyway I had got my doctor , the one I had wanted , one whose opinions were not for sale to the highest bidder . Outside I found that the sun had clouded over . I glanced up at the weather tower . A gentle wind was blowing out of the west . " And when the wind is from the west , that 's when fishing is the best . " My nostrils began to dilate . I walked back up to the club and called the jail again and asked Sulo to please get the Lieutenant on the phone . The Lieutenant , it appeared , was still sitting there waiting for me . Sulo would put him on . " You lawyer man vants you ! " he shouted . " I wo n't be over this afternoon , Lieutenant , " I said . " Yes , Sulo just told me a while ago . I 'm waiting for Laura . Is everything all right ? " " Just getting a little punchy , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be alone to roll some spitballs for Mr. Lodwick . " The Lieutenant laughed , and I briefly told him of the arrangementsI had made for an examination of his wife later that afternoon by Doctor Trembath . " Please sec that she gets there , " I added . " But she already has a doctor , " the Lieutenant countered in that aggrieved voice I was getting to know so well . " Yes , I know , " I said . " Then is n't he enough ? Do we need two ? " I mentally counted to ten . " I do n't want to seem picky , Lieutenant , but I happen to consider your particular doctor professionally on a par with Amos Crocker . In fact lie must have recommended him . " I paused . " Listen , Lieutenant , I 'm getting a little weary of having to threaten to pull out of this goddam case every time I want your consent to any recommendation I make . But I should warn yo  --  f you insist upon having that doctor I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for old Crocker 's leg to mend . They 'd make such a charming pair ; they both improvise so well . Do I make myself clear ? " " You do . " " Now are you sending your wife over to the new doctor ? " There was a long pause , and I could picture the quick angry flush , the sipping of the tiny mustache , the biting of the lower lip . " I 've been counting ten , Lieutenant , and I 'm almost there . " " Yes , damn it ! I 'll send her . " " Ah , that 's better . Now I can away to my fishing with a carefree heart . " " I hope you fall in . " " What 's that ! " " I said , damn it , I hope you have good luck . " " That 's the old fight , Lieutenant . I heard you the first time . Now you 're talking my language . " " Will you be down tomorrow ? " I had n't thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer came out of a clear sky . " No , Lieutenant , I wo n't be down tomorrow . I 've just decided it 's time for me to visit the scene of this business . Tomorrow I 'm going to Thunder Bay . " " When will I see you , then ? " ioo ioi " Probably the next day . But do n't pin me down . I 'll see you when I see you . Right now I 'm going fishing . " So I went fishing and my heart was carefree and gay . At dusk I snapped my leader on two trout of voting age and finally , just at dark , latched on to grandpa and the fight was on . " Come , come , sweet lover darlin ' , " I coaxed and wheedled . " Come to daddy , come to daddy . " Twenty minutes later I went into the familiar daisy hoop and slipped the net under him . " Ah . . . . " It was my biggest brook trout of the season . It looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavering light of my flashlight . But best of all , for twenty whole minutes I had managed to forget all about the Manioncase. chapter 16When I got home from fishing I found old Parnell McCarthy dozing on the bench that the chiropractor across the hall had thoughtfully provided for the lance and halt who sought his services . Parnell sat with his chubby hands locked across the front of his colorful Tattersall vest . I had picked the vest up for him , much to Maida 's dismay , on one of my Canadian fishing trips ; it was among his proudest possessions , perhaps something like a barber and his Cadillac ; and it occurred to me that I 'd never once seen him button his coat across this flaming garment since I 'd presented it to him the year before . I secretly longed to wear such a vest myself , but , craven soul , somehow lacked the nerve . Parnell rocked gently as he slumbered . " Whistler 's delinquent little brother , " I thought wryly . The old man 's series of chins rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips sounded faintly like a far-off motorboat . Well , not so far off , I thought judiciously ; rather more like the blubbery trumpeting sounds that my father Oliver 's horses used to snake with their lips after I had watered them down for the night when I was a kid . I had n't heard that sound in years . Parnell sighed and trumpeted away . I stood looking down at my old friend . I leaned forward and smelled his breath . " Ah , apparently sober , " I concluded with relief . I sniffed again to make sure . Just then Parnell opened one eye and caught me at it . " Ought to be ashamed of yourself , boy , " he rumbled , " sniffin ' an ' spyin ' on an old gentleman just after taking his evenin ' catnap ? not catnip ! " He lurched heavily to his feet . " Where in hell was you at ? I nearly gave you up . Ah , fishin ' , I see by your outlandish and evil-smelling costume . What fetid malarial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get yourself up to look and smell like a beachcomber to catch a mere fish ? You see , I can sniff , too , my fine laddie buck .... C'm on , let 's get going , boy . There 's work to be clone . Come no  --  ell me the whole story , from B to bunghole . I 'm fairly dyin ' to hear it . " I unlocked my office and brought in my fresh laundry which was resting against the door . I waved Parnell to a comfortable chair , put my fish on ice , got into my pajamas and an old bathrobe , lit a fire which thoughtful Maida had laid in the Franklin stove and turned out the lights . Then I sat and told Parnell the whole story , the good and the bad , my plans and hopes , all my fears and anxieties. 102 103He sat quietly through the whole recital , for the most part silent and unblinking , at times looking variously , in the flickering firelight , like a statue of Judgment , an aging satyr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late W. C. Fields , a bust of Socrate  --  nd even that lovely old ad for Lash 's Bitters . But mostly , thank goodness , he looked like good old shrewd old kindly old Parnell McCarthy . Parnell interrupted me rarely and then only briefly , in such a way that 1 knew that his alert mind was racing , racing faster than the numbers and lights on a runaway pinball machine . It felt good just to have him there , and already some of the confusion and uncertainty that had oppressed me earlier in the day seemed magically to disappearin the simple act of telling . Down across the deserted square the cracked bell of the clock in the city hall tower sounded one . I loved its wavering clangor . The bell had been cracked since November 11 , 1918 , and any city father that suggested replacing it courted swift political oblivion . The sound was more of a jarring thud than a knell ; a prolonged metallic shudder , as though some giant armed with a sledge had struck a broken rail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , Parnell , " I said , " what does the prosecuting attorney say ? Does the defense have a Chinaman 's chance ? Do n't spare my feelings . Give me both barrels , my friend . " " I 'm thinkin ' , " he said , closing his eyes and tugging at the grizzled slack of his throat . This was our little game . During most of my time as prosecutor Parnellhad acted as a sort of volunteer attorney for the defense . We had " tried " all my big tough cases in advance , sitting by the Franklin stove or across the top of Grandma Biegler 's old dining-room table . Thus had Parnell hammered and teste  --  nd frequently revised ? the theory and strategy of my cases on the stout anvil of his mind . He was , as I had told Mister Cool , my legal whetstone . This sagacious old man was in fact probably the biggest single reason I had run up , as D.A. , the record of convictions of which he seemed so much prouder than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed vaguely , as I sensed now , that to him I was a sort of what-might-have-been . " Do I have a chance ? " I repeated . " Of course you 've got a chance , " he began gruffly . He cleared his throat . " Do n't talk that way , boy . Do n't sell yourself short . It 's poor psychology and , worse yet , in your case false modesty , too . It does n't become you , boy . Let us please dispense with the chat of the bull . You 're good and you damn well know it . " He shook his head . " Quite a case , boy , quite a case indeed , " he said musingly. "  --  only wish I were in it . " He sighed . " It 's been many a year since I 've wished that about any case . " This was the opening I had been waiting for . " You 're going to be in it , Parnell , " I said quietly . " Right up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . What do you say ? " It grew silent . Parnell sat very still and I thought for a moment he had dozed off again . I leaned closer and saw that his eyes were open , wide open . In the dying fire glow I thought they glistened suspiciously , but I may have been mistaken . " You mean that , boy ? " he said , barely above a whisper . " You really want inc in your big murdercase ? " " You heard me , Parn . I want you , I need you , and I mean it . I 'm not being magnanimous , either . I simply and selfishly need your goddam help . You know what winning this case means to me , I do n't have to tell you . " "  --  ' ll do it , Paul , " he said , " but on one condition . " " What 's that , Parn ? " " That Parnell McCarthy stays behind the scenes , strictly in the background . You understand ? Not even your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . There must be no leak . " " Why , Parn ? " I said . " Tell me why ? " This was an interesting development . Parnell snorted . " The sight of this bloated whisky-drinkin ' rednosedold man settin ' at a counsel table would be enough to queer any case , " he went on . " Lord knows you got hurdles enough to get over without addin ' me . And if anything went wron  --  he ever unpredictablejury you know , bo  --  would n't want that on my conscienceor on yours .  --  t 's better that I do my sittin ' beside you in spirit . I 'll be close by in any case . " He paused . " And there 's one other reason , boy . " " Tell me , Parn ? " " When you win this case I want it to be solely your victory . You 're already on the right track , boy , you know that , and you do n't really need me . You won lots of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to help in my own fumblin ' way , of course , but it 's enough for an old party like me to see you make the grade . Do you understand what I 'm sayin ? " Ile paused and , almost angrily , cleared his throat . "  --  ? Oh , hell , give me one of those awful Eyetalian cigars . I 'll smoke it out of self-defens  --  hat abominable stinker of104 105yours is makin ' me eyes smart . Lord help me , it smells like a Belli uda onion . Is it really an onion now , boy ? " " I understand , Pam , " I said , passing him a cigar . " I 'll accept your terms on one condition . " " Ah , what 's that , now ? You 'd think we was after discussin ' the terms of a goddam ninety-nine-year chain-store lease . Whatever is your fine condition now ? " " That we share whatever fee I get straight across the board , " I said . " I told you what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ever getting it . " Parnell blinked his eyes . " What you aimin ' to do , Paul ? Make an old man bawl ? Is that what you 're after tryin ' to do ? " " I mean it , Parn , just like I meant asking you into the case , " I said gruffly . " We share the fee or no partnership in the case . it to help you and humor your generous whim . Having said that it may be ungracious and commercial-soundin ' of me to acid that if you do n't get paid before the trial you probably never will after , win or lose . " He laughed briefly . " I have to say that now so you wo n't think it 's money I 'm after , which God knows I ai n't and never been . But you are n't either , Paul , you 're a lawyer , too , not a misdirected shopkeeper who 'd mistakenly gone to law school . I 'm pleased and mighty proud that you would undertaketo defend this lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I broke in , " you know goddam well that the plight of Lieutenant Manion has got little or nothing to do with my taking this case . Do n't give me that blarney . Please , Parn , pleas  --  o n't try to build me up into a bleeding liberal . Now please lay off . " " The role fits you more than you think , boy , more than you think , " Parnell went on . " Now you listen to me . You did n't consent to continueyour man 's case when that young Mitch fellow gave you the golden chance , did you ? No you did n't . Now you could have sold that continuance to your client and you know damn well you could , still kecpin ' your hand in the case for all your other reasons , and still givin ' yourself more time to pry some money out of him . And more time for your fishin ' . All this you could have done . I say I 'm proud of you , damn it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another three or four months . Now let 's hear no more bulldozin ' about it . Poke up that fire and fetch me a bottle of beer . " He grimaced . " I 'd just as lief drink mare 's water but there 's work to be don  --  nd let 's get down to business . " I drew myself up proudly . " I 'll have you understand , Mr. McCarthy , that I pay over five bucks a case for my beer . Every bottle is tested by virgins in rubber gloves . No finger touch . I 've even seen Heinie the brewmaster on ' I'V . Charming articulate fellow who talks through a permanent mist of sauerkraut , like my great-uncle Otto . Mine goot friendts , dis I , dcsc hop  --  a pest vat money can puy , ya ! ' Authentic , see , very Old World , and all done purely for love , like mother 's bread . Perhaps you 'd prefer some nice tepid tap water instead . " " Get on wid you , " Parnell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then archly cocking his head . " And who , pray tel  --  ho tests them there virgins ? " io6 107chapter 17Parnell took a sip of his beer . He swallowed , looked thoughtful , and then made a wry face , like a small boy distastefully eating his spinach . " The original diagnosis was correct , " he said . " Better you sue your goot friendt Heinie , ya ! " " Very well , Mr. Prosecutor , " I said . " Quit slandering my hospitality . Let 's have your reasons why my man should be convicted . It 's getting late . " Ile stared at me vacantly for a moment and then leaned forward , speaking earnestly . " If I were prosecutor , boy , " he began , " I would hammer relentlessly at this one big question : If the defendant Maniondid not take a gun and go to Barney Quill 's bar solely to kill him , why in hell else did he go there ? Members of the jury , ' I would say , here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on his person , unerringly seeks out the man who had just raped his wif  --  nd pumps him full of lead . ' Why , why , wh  --  f it was not solely to kill the man , which is promptly what he did ? ' " Parnell paused , his gray eyes glowing and alight . " Does defense counsel concedeany merit in this argument ? How , my resourceful friend , do you propose to get around that ? " " Go on , Parn , " I said . " There 's more , much more . Hit me with all of it and then I 'll try to fight back . " " Yes , there 's more to it , " Parnell continued thoughtfully . " In connection with this same line of argument , and also to dispute your claim of insanity , I would keep harping on the fact that , immediately after the shooting , the defendant apparently threatened to shoot the bartender , who followed him from the place , and then returned to his trailer and gave himself up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I just shot Barney Quill . ' In other words : Take me in , Mister Policeman , my mission is accomplished ; I went there to get Barney and by God I got him . ' Are these the actions of a crazy man , of a man who did n't know what he was doing ? Why , even his wife , who knew his jealous nature , predictedhe would kill Barne  --  nd I 'm damned if that 's what he did n't . " " Objection , Parn , " I said . " No fair on that jealousy business . That'sinside information I hope the prosecution does n't and wo n't have . But otherwise you 've been hitting me where it really hurts . " " Objection overruled , " Parnell continued coolly . " This youngLodwick fellow is inexperienced and all , and perhaps no great heavyweightas a prosecutor , at least yet , but he 'll simply smell jealousy from her statement that your man would kill Barney if . . . . And if he does n't smell it the jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like that statement of hers , Parn , " I said . " You know it 's got me worried . But I would argue back that here was a woman in a desperate pligh  --  bout to be rape  --  ho seized at a straw , a last desperate deterrent stratagem , the threat of physical retaliation and punishment if Barney should rape her . What else could the poor woman do or say ? And after all , how in hell could she know what her husband might do ? Just how many other men can the People show he had killed for raping her ? And think of how much worse it would be if before the shooting she 'd told Manion what she 'd told Barney . " " Good boy , Polly , " Parnell said , nodding . " Yes , a fairly good answer , young man . Did you just think of it ? " " I guess I 've been brooding about it all the time I was fishing today . " I shook my head gloomily . " But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've barely scratched the surface . For one thing , I 've an enormouslot of law to look . I simply have n't had time to get at it . Anyway , I 'd like to get all the facts first . All we want are the facts , ma'am . " " We 've got a lot of work to do , " Parnell said reprovingly . " We 've got a lot of law to look . Remember , I 'm in this case now , too , young man . " " I sit corrected , " I said , smiling . " But right now you 're the prosecutor . Proceed with your indictment , Mr. D.A . " After that Parnell and I kicked the case around , planned strategies , rejected them , substituted others , pondered how we might get in evidence of the rape , how the prosecution might block it , how we might try to bring out at least the fact of Laura 's lie-detector test . . . Parnellfinally hauled out his silver watch . " Lord help us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wake . This is enough for tonight , lad . Now get along with you to bed . We 've both got to keep our wits about us in this here case ; it just reeks with lovely points of law . By the way , Judge Maitland will be sitting , I do hope . " I shook my head . " No , Pam , I 'm afraid not . He 's still over at Mayo 's and his condition is n't good . " " Who then ? " " I have n't the foggiest notion . And if Mitch knows he is n't saying . I hope it is n't one of those dreary downstate political hack  --  e 're go-io8 109ing to need a real lawyer on this one . By the way , I 'm driving up to Thunder Bay tomorrow to have a look around . Want to come along ? " " Bless you , of course I do . I been standin ' here waitin ' for you to ask mc . And Maida , too ? " " Maida ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's just a dame that types letters and reads Mickey Spillane . " " Maida , " Pam replied firmly . " There 's detective work to be done . If there 's some nice ripe skulduggery up there in Thunder Bay , a smart woman will nose it out . Maida is smart and she goes along . That 's an order from senior counsel , young man . " " Yes , sir , Mr. McCarthy , " I said meekly . " Please , sir , when do we leave ? " " Sharp at eight from your office . " " But Maida does n't get here till nine . And I have n't the heart to phone her at this ungodly hour . My God , it 's after two . " As Parnell walked to the door there seemed to be a sprightliness in his bearing I had n't seen in years . " Set your clock and call her at seven , boy . Old Thomas Edison thrived for years on four hours rest . Does a young man like you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's work to be done and we must up and away . We 're leavin ' here at eight . " " Yes , sir , " I said . " Anything more , sir ? And many thanks , Parn . Yo  --  ou 've already given me lots of food for ulcers . " Parnell hooked his thumb through the armhole of his tattersall vest and grinned his irresistible melting Irish grin . " Good night , Polly , and God bless you . Tonight you 've made me feel more like a real lawyer than I have in years and years . " IIe paused . " Now  --  must hurry away before I really break down and bawl . Good night , goddamit . " " Good night , Pam , " I called softly after his plodding retreating figure . I went to the phonograph and put on a recording of Debussy 's haunting " The Blessed Damozel . " Then I sat in the darkness staring into the fire . Little unseen bellows seemed occasionally to fitfully fan the dying embers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated the eternal fascination and mystery of fire . ... I sighed ; I was tired , tired bodily and mentally . " So now , Bicglcr , " I mused , " you 're about to become a private eye . " It was a new role for me and I wondered if I would do half as well as Parnell had in his new role as prosecutor . The phonograph took over , the women 's voices now murmurouslyjoining the orchestra , swelling , fading , soaring into ecstasies of movingand melancholy sound . I sat there covered with gooseflesh until the last strains had died away . The fire was out . I shivered and tottered my way to my bedroom , set the alarm clock , yawned prodigiouslyand flung my pajama bottoms in a corne  --  nd fell on the bed , asleep instantly . I dreamt- a dream , an interminable dream about a monster brook trout that seemed bent upon pulling me into the water . For a while it was touch and go . All that finally saved me from a watery grave was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye open ; it was broad daylight ; Detective Biegler must be up and at the keyhole. chapter 18So sinless and devoted to the pastoral virtues is the Upper Peninsula that trained private investigators are virtually nonexistent . As everywhere , of course , there are the usual proportion of yearning adolescentsand occasional eccentrics who have won a tin star and a fingerprintoutfit from one of the mail-order diploma mills , the kind that turn out detectives in twelve easy lessons . But these groping souls would do us no good ; they generally wound up with a black eye or in reporting on dead beats for credit bureaus at two dollars a head . More often they wound up with the black eye anyway , after which they tended to enroll in courses on advanced refrigeration .

After sleeping through a generation or more of genteel Rip Van Winkle poverty it had been rediscovered and miraculously resuscitated by the advent of those curious seasonal wanderers , that modern American gypsy known as the Summer Tourist . As the care and feeding of tourists had more and more absorbed the attentions of the townsfolk , more and more had I avoided the place ; as a class tourists had a tendency unduly to grieve me ; and it came as something of a shock to recall that I had not been near the picturesque old town in a dozen-odd years . Barney Quill , a comparative newcomer , was nothing more to me than a name ; I seemed to have read about him once or twice in the newspapers ; he had shot a bear or caught a big fish or some such thing . . . As Maida and Parnell and I drove along the lake shore , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw that I had forgotten how beautiful the drive to Thunder Bay was ; the towering sighinggroves of fragrant Norway pines , the broad expanses of clean white sand , the sea gulls , always the endlessly wheeling sea gulls ; an occasional bald eagle seeming bent on soaring straight up to Heaven ; the intermittent craggy and pine-clad granite or sandstone hills , sometimesrising gauntly to the dignity of small mountains , then again sudden stretches of sand or more majestic Norway pine  --  nd always , 112of course , the vast glittering heaving lake , the world 's largest inland sea , as treacherous and deceitful as a spurned woman , either caressingor raging at the shore , more often turbulent than not , but today on its best company manners , presenting the falsely placid aspect of a mill pond . " I 've been thinkin ' , " Parnell McCarthy began . " Please , Parn , " I begged . " Please , not about the damned case , not now . " I gestured toward the lake . " All this incredible beauty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been thinkin ' , " Parnell solemnly went on , " that it 's been well over a quarter-century since I 've troubled to come along this way . That last time my Nora and I were in a buckboard drawn by a team of bay mares . . . . I 've been thinking of what fools indeed we mortals be , letting all this beauty languish unseen while we , like suicidal lemmings , hurry on our way to our obscure graves , chasing dollars , chasing women , chasing trout , chasing the dubious pleasures of the bottle . " He sighed and took a deep breath . " ' Elie waste , the hideous waste of livin  --  t 's enough to make one weep . Boy , I must indeed mend me ways . " " Stop , Parn , stop , " Maida said , giggling like a schoolgirl . " You sound more and more like Cyrano . If you keep on like this I swear I 'll fall in love . " I glanced at Maida . " When did you exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I may say so , I think we 'd better flee this lovely lake shore before all of us start cracking up . " The car toiled up a steep granite bluff , the roadway hacked out between towering walls of solid rock , and then began the long descent . There , spread out before us , was the village of Thunder Bay , as neat and ordered as though viewed from an airplane , clustered tightly among the tall pines along the edge of the glittering and now peaceful bay that had given the town its name . " And now to the wars , " I said , clamping a fresh cigar in my teeth and stepping on the gas . I speculated a little on what it was that drew the tourists to this remoteplace . It lacked the reek of ancient lore possessed by St. Ignace , with its great new bridge and " authentic " Indian chieftains in full regalia solemnly selling the lamblike tourists equally authentic hundred-year-old tomahawks made the winter before in Gaylord ; it did not have the endlessly photogenic locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endlessly did , that its locks annually handledmore tonnage than any in the world ; its shoreline was not113adorned with the tinted and dramatic Pictured Rocks of Munising ; it lacked Marquette 's imposing iron ore loading docks , each dwarfingin height and length even the Queen Mary . No , the town did not possess any of these alluring tourist properties ; it had no golf courses or crumbling fortresses ; it had no tall roaring waterfalls from the top of which a monotonous procession of legendary Indian maidens had leapt for love and love alone ; it lacked any medicinal springs to throw orange peels and coke bottles into or any copper or iron mines or towering ski jumps or Indian burial inrnmds or places to dig for agates or ancient arrowheads ; nor had it any displays of two-headed calves or trained bears or wolves or even any mangy coyotes . Nor , final ignominy , had any of its hamburger stands or lunch counters , so far as I knew , been blessed by Duncan Hines . Perhaps , I reflected , perhaps it possessed the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew the mosquitoes awa  --  nd great natural beauty , a beauty as yet unmarredby man . And , as I presently saw , it certainly had the tourists ; the place was teeming with them ; and I slowed down abruptly to avoid collecting a representative specimen on my fender , a prospectivetrophy more revolting for me to contemplate than the head of abull moose . " Look where you 're driving , Mac ! " my near specimen shouted . " Excuse me , " I apologized contritely , " I should have taken thesidewalk . " We drove slowly up the main street of the town , past the tourist park on our right , nestled in among a tall grove of pines on the lake shore , past the usual cluster of gas stations , a grocery store , the post office , then two churches and , as though to achieve proportion and balance , an abrupt rash of neon-lit taverns , the inevitable souvenir shop , a beauty parlor , and all the rest . Near the end of the long street , on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attractivethree-story frame structure . A screened-in veranda ran along tho entire front and half the side nearest the lake . This was the Thunder Bay Inn , in the barroom of which the proprietor Barney Quill had met his death such a short time before . The last time I had seen the Inn it had been boarded up and now , freshly painted , it was a mecca for school marms and summer tourists . A short distance past the Inn I stopped the car and turned off the key . " Well , Parn , " I said , " what 's the strategy ? " " Polly , " Parnell said , " I suggest you drop me off at one of the smaller tavern  --  o fear , I 'm not going to drin  --  nd then dropMaida at the beauty shop for a manicure or something . Both strike me as being likely spots to begin our search . Then you his yourself directly to the Inn . The word will fan out soon enough that you 're in town and they 'll be expecting you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done with it . Then I suggest we all meet back at the hotelaround noon and have lunch and possibly compare notes . What do you think ? " I nodded . " Sounds fine to me , Parn . " " But I do n't need a manicure , " Maida pouted . " Anyway , I do my own nails . " Parnell bowed gallantly . " I will grant that any attention from thesesordid entrepreneurs of beauty to your comely person , dear lady , would be carrying coals to Newcastle , " he said , " hut I 'm equally surethat your great wit , matched only by your ravishing beauty , will suggestto you a plausible reason for visiting their malodorous precincts . " " I 've warned you , Parnell , " Maida laughed . " If you keep running on this way you 're going to have an infatuated female on your hands . " " Ah , my dear , I shall impatiently await and welcome that eventuality , " Parnell replied , again gravely bowing with leis air of impishnessand antique courtliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes dancing . " But please , Madam , please , I beg of yo  --  o not ever suggest matrimony , " he continued gravely . " Men have contrived fewer devices more deadly to romance than marriage itself . " Tle fluttered his fingers lightly through the air . " Gay wings , " he murmured , blowing Maida a kiss . " Ah lass , let us stoutly resolve ever to remain gay and unfettered . " " Ah , Parnell , Parnell . . . . " Maida murmured , wistfully shaking her head . " Ah , Cyrano , Cyrano , " I muttered , stirring restlessly . Parnell must have been quite a boy in his day , I reflected , quite a boy . . " Rubbish ! " I said petulantly , wheeling the car around in an abrupt U-turn . Enough of this romantic buffoonery. 115114chapter 19With some trepidation I deposited Parnell at the first tavern we came to and then Maida at the beauty parlor , wishing them good luck . Then I drove back to the hotel , parked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door Lieutenant Manion had conic and left by when he had shot Barne  --  nd lit up a cigar , took a deep breath , and pushed against the door . It did not yield . I rattled and wrenched at the knob ; the door was locked . A small typewritten sign on the glass informed me that the place would not be open for business until noon . I peered through the window ; the place was dim and there was no sign of activity . I shrugged and walked around front to the main entrance of the hotel ; perhaps I could at least get a peek at the bar . Since the hotel stood on a steep sandy hill , the front accordingly rose considerably higher above the street level than in the rear , where the building in fact ran a few feet into the hill . I mounted the steps to the screenedinporch . I had been wrong ; Mr. Duncan Hines had been there before me , as his discreetly beckoning little tin sign now reassured me . ThunderBay had at last made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan approved . I could visualize this ubiquitouslittle ma  --  is bib full of gravy stains , his pockets full of pills , his soul full of hop  --  nawing his way across a continent , leaving diplomas of approval in his wake like a sort of gastronomic Kilroy . I sighed and moved into the hotel . " Peptic ulcers can now be gaily faced , " I thought . " Duncan has et here . " The lobby was deserted except for a knot of numbed and **30;408;TOOLONG gathered about a flaming large stone fireplace . It was only 72 degrees outside . . . . I glanced quickly around and found a sign on a door saying " Cocktail Lounge . " I tried the door and found it unlocked and went quickly down the stairs . " Biegler , " I thought , " your career as a detective has officially begun . " The stale beery morning smell of an unaired barroom smote my nostrils . I paused at the bottom to become accustomed to the dim light . I seemed to be alone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a small roped-off dance space in the center . I spotted Laura Manion 's pinball machine in the corner , to my left , standing between an upright piano and a garishly colored jukebox . Adjoining this and nearer me were the wash rooms . I advanced slowly into the room . To my right about thirty feet from the street door I had just tried to enter , was the bar itself . I gave a start . Standing motionless behind the bar , holding a towel and glassin his hands and intently regarding me , was a small dark man , a wiry , foxy-looking little man in a white apron . " Hello , " I said , advancing . " I 'm Paul Biegler from Chippewa , Lieutenant Manion 's lawyer . " " Yes , I know , " he replied , averting his eyes , busily polishing hisglass . " What can I do for you , Mr. Biegler ? I 'm Paquette the bar-tender . " " Well , " I said , smiling , " after you 've served me a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present during the shoot-ing . " The soft drink and a glass were placed before me with deft dispatch ; the money rung up ; and then lie was back polishing anotherglass . " I was present , " he said evenly . " Just like it said in the news-papers . " " Maybe we could talk a little about what happened , " I said . " Maybe , " he said , inspecting his glass in the light . " And then again , maybe we could not . " This sort of sparring could go on for days , I saw , an enterprise for which I lacked both the time and taste ; I preferred seeing my little foxes in the woods . I swiftly decided to level with my cozy friend . Either he would talk or he would n't ; the sooner I found it out the better . Even his failure to talk might prove something or other . " Look , Mr. Paquette , " I said , " whether you choose to clam up or talk is a matter of considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in cour  --  here you 'll bloody well have to talk and plenty . But maybe all of us would save a lot of time and turmoil ifyou 'd help me to find out what I came here to find out and which I promise you I will find out . " The polishing had stopped . " Like what ? " he said . I shrugged . " Oh , for a starter , like where Barney and Mann  --  mean Lieutenant Manio  --  ere standing when the shots were fired . " " I did n't see any shots fired . " This had not been clear from the newspaper reports . " Where were you ? " I said . " I was standing out on the floor talking with some customers at a table . We 'd had an unusually busy night and Mr. Quill had relievedme so that I could have a rest . He was always thoughtful that way . The crowd was thinning out . " 116 117 " The ever-thoughtful Mister Quill , " I thought , and then a little bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was standingout on the floor . I-Iere was a poor fatigued bartender , who had been relieved by his thoughtful boss so that he could rest , standing out on the floor talking to his customers . I went baying along the scent . " Who were these customers ? " I asked casually . " Fellow called Pedersen and his wife and a friend from Iron Bay . l lica 'd been out for a drive . " I made a mental note to remember the name . " Where was the Pedersen table located ? " I went on . " Out on the floor . " " Naturally , " I said . " But where on the floor ? Over by the pinball machine ? The stairs ? The piano ? " I paused , pointing , suddenly sure it was by none of these . " Or was their table over by the outside door there ? " " Yes , " he murmured . Anyone standing by the window near the door , I guessed , could have commanded an unobstructed view of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron , say , like Lieutenant Manion . But better I lay off that now , I decided ; no use clamming up this sly character at the outset . Well , maybe I should explore it just a bit , to worry him , to let him guess a little what I really suspected . " How come , Mr. Paquette ? " I continued easily . " How come you did n't sit down when you chatted with the Pedersens ? Are n't there usually four chairs at a table ? " He shot me a quick look , but he answered readily enough . " They had a package on the other chair , " he said . From the quick little gleam of triumph in his eyes I guessed he was telling the truth . But his triumph was short-lived ; I could not let him off the hook so easily . " Could n't this poor tired bartender have sat and held their packagein his lap ? Do n't tell me it was an anvil . Or could n't he have drawn up another chair ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't tell me there were n't any spare chair  --  he crowd was thinning out , re-member ? " This time I had really tagged him . He scowled and compressed his lips and glanced apprehensively in the direction of the stairway . " Or perhaps , " I went on , " you 're like the postman who climbs mountains on his vacatio  --  ou simply love to stand on your own two feet . " Like most people , Mr. Paquette could stand almost anything butridicule . " What you driving at ? " he demanded angrily . " Sitting or standin  --  hat goddani difference does it make ? " " Little Standing Bull , " I thought . But I was n't ready to spell out my thoughts , at least not quite yet , and anyway I was sure now that he knew that I knew . Perhaps it would give him a little more respect for the truth . " Do n't race your motor , " I said . " In any case Barney Quill was alone behind the bar when Lieutenant Manion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . " " Sitting or standing ? " " Standing . He always stood when he was at the bar . " I pondered my next question . " flow long had he been relieving you , standing there alone behind the bar ? " " Oh , for upwards of an hour I 'd say . " Little Standing Bull had kept the weary vigil by the door for nearly a whole hour ! " And when had he relieved yon ? " " Around midnight , I should say . " " And what time was the shooting ? " " At twelve forty-six exactly . " " How would you know that ? " " At the first shot I wheeled around and looked at the clock . " Had he been surprised , I wondered , to sec the wrong man down ? The clock was on the wall behind the bar . " Then von must have seen some of the other shots fired , did n't you , Mr. Paquette ? " IIe lit a cigarette and I thought his hand trembled ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bar rail , leaning over and pointing at something down behind the bar . " I had long ago learned that this nice air of meticulous fairness in a witness was often a sure sign that he was hostile or lying . " Come now , that something was of course Barney Quill , was n't it ? " " Well , yes . It turned out to be . " " And where at the bar was the Lieutenant standing ? " He pointed . " Near the middle , there , right between those two service rails . It was the only place open ; the bar itself was crowded , all with men . Barney had just bought another round of drinks . He was generous that way . The Lieutenant turned and left almost as soon as I 'd turned around . I ran out the door after hi  --  he door you just tried to enter . " " Oh , so you saw me out there . What happened then ? " " When I got outside he wheeled around and faced me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buster ? ' " 119I winced over that one , but continued bravely . " What did you do ? " " I said , No , sir ' and hurried back inside . " This was even worse for our side than the newspaper had reported it ; this grim fighting talk from my Lieutenant was more than a little inconsistent with our proposed picture of a man whose wits had departedhim from shock and excessive grief . But the show must go on . . .. " And Buster is n't your name , of course ? " I went on . " No , Alphonse is my first name . People generally call me Al or Phonse . " Yes , people continue to be as original as all hell , I thought . " Was Barney still alive ? " " No ; he 'd apparently died instantly . Five out of the six shots got to him . The man did n't have a chance . " " You mean a chance to fire a shot himself ? " Quickly : " I mean a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man speak ? " " I personally heard nothing but later I heard that Barney had said Good evening , Lieutenant . ' " " What about Manio  --  ad anyone heard him speak ? " " No . Apparently he did not utter a word although several persons later claimed they had spoken to him , including one of our waitresses . " " What 's her name ? " " Fern Rund.quist . " This was fairly good news ; see , my poor addled client could n't see or hear anything . The defense was up , down , then in a neutral corner .... " Did you go look at Barney ? " I said . " Yes . " " Did you examine his body ? " " Yes , but not closely until after I 'd cleared the bar and locked the place . " " What time was that ? " " About one o'clock . Nobody had to be urged to leave ; most of them fled the joint right after the shooting . " " So that finally you were left all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . Somebody had to wait for the police . " " Who called them ? " " I did . " " When ? " He hesitated for an instant . " It will all be a matter of record , you know , " I said . " They 'll tell me if you don't. " 120 " I was just thinking , " he said . " About one-fifteen , I should say . " " My , my . How conic you waited so long to notify the police , Mr. Paquette ? " " Oh , the excitement and al  --  ? I guess I just forgot . " " Hm , your boss is shot to death at twelve forty-si  --  n all the excitementyou do n't forget to note tha  --  nd then you remember a half hour later that maybe the police should be notified . It simply had n't occurred to you before , is that it ? " " Right , " he snapped . I sipped my drink and lit a fresh cigar . Alphonse Paquette had resumedpolishing a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had alreadypolished at length . This man , I concluded , probably knew much more than he had told anyone , or perhaps ever intended to tell anyone , but certain probabilities had already emerged despite his reluctance . I was now convinced that liarncv ( ) hill had been waiting for the Lieutenant ; that he had deliberately relieved his bartendernot only to get him out of the way of the anticipated show down but also to in turn warn Barney and further so that lie , Barney could get behind the bar himself . It had been his fortress . Theo by buying drinks he had further surrounded himself with an unwitting protective human cordo  --  ll but at the waitresses ' service station , which customers were everywhere supposed not to occupy . That this one open spot had proved to be Barney 's Achilles ' heel was a nice ironic touch . I was now equally sure that he must have been armed ? else why should he have waited around at all ? I decided to play my hunch . " When did the police arrive ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and winding roads , you know . " " Yes , I know . " I paused . " So you were alone with the body for over an hour ? " " Why , yes , that 's correct . Somebody had to take the rap and wait . " He was still preoccupied with the same glass , polishing it intently , and I was growing afraid he would wear it out . " You just told me that , " I said and again I paused . " Would you mind greatly putting down that glass , Mr. Paquette ? You 've been working on it for the last half-hour . Anyway , I like to look at the peopleI 'm talking with , it 's an old-fashioned notion I have . " He had put down the glass and stood facing me with an air of defiant and unfeigned hostility . " I 'm looking , Mister , " he said . " Fire away . " deleted linesraped and beat up Laura Manion . " It was time to level . " Look , chum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the bar so you would n't get hurt ? And on his orders were n't you standing by that window for nearly an hour so you could spot the Lieutenant comingand warn Barney ? " " Who said Barney raped her ? " he demanded . " You doubt it ? " I said . " I was n't there . " " I know you were n't there , comrade . But I just asked you if you doubled that he 'd raped her . " He had a cute little habit of turning my question to other channels . Defiantly : " Yes , I doubt it . If he laid her at all , which I also doubt , it was with her willing consent . Anybody can see she 's a floozie . " There was going to be great fun with this winning character in court , I saw . " I see , " I said . " You could n't tell me just now whether lie raped her , because you were n't there , but now , still not having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . Is that it ? " I paused , pondering whether to risk drying up this man by further antagonizing him or to push on , doggedly getting as much as I could by a softer approach . I decided to take the risk and speak a few homely truths . " Mr. Paquette , " I said , " you do n't like my asking you all these embarrassing questions , I suppose , and I really ca n't blame you . Nobodylikes the hot seat . In fact you obviously bitterly resent my askingthem . But that 's the penalty for having a ringside seat at a murder , and it so happens that a man 's freedom and whole future rides on this case . And you happen to have some of the answers . Now I intend to get those answers , my friend , but you are not coming clean with me , not even halfway clean . And if I can see that you are n't , I promise you I 'll make a jury see it . What you 've had from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be nothing to the going over I 'll give you in court unless you come off this cozy routine . I 'll make a damn fool or liar out of you or both .  --  ' ll burn your ass to a crisp . " He flushed with hot anger and took a quick step back . " Is that a threat ? " For a moment I thought he might try to hit me . The momentpassed . " No , not a threat , " I said , " but a promise . I 'd rather call it a little preview of what lies in store for you if you do n't try telling the truth . And fast . The truth is so easy , Mr. Paquette ; nothing to make up , no evasions , no traps , no entanglements , no inconsistent statements12Lto try to explain away . Just the simple truth . I recommend you try it sometime . Why not now ? " " You think everything I 've told you is a pack of lies ? " he demanded . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not telling the whole truth . Do you think I 'm a goddam dummy , man ? I 've been bulldozed by experts . While you 're good and will doubtless improve , you still do n't quite pitch in that league . " " What do you mean ? " he said . " You 're leveling with me only on the things you know I already know or that others will testify to anyway , or things you know I can check you up on . And you 're evasive , evasive as hell . A little while ago I asked you if it was n't true that instead of relieving you Barney sent you away from the bar so you 'd be out of range when the fireworks started and also to warn him . You did n't attempt to answer me . Did you think I 'd forget that question or that it 'd just go away ? " Alphonse Paquette blinked his eyes thoughtfully . I had apparently given him food for thought ; he seemed to be weighing something , considering the pros and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what his angle was . I was convinced now that he was holding back , but why was he ? Why this loyalty , this desire to shield something or someone ? Had the thoughtful and relieving Mister Barney meant so much to him ? And , if so , what was there in it for him ? Who 'd put the " silencer " on him and why ? " You still have n't answered me , " I said . He sighed and shook his head . " He did n't send me away , " he said almost doggedly . " He relieved me , just like I told you . I was n't watching for Lieutenant Manion or anyone . " I sensed that I 'd almost had him . " Very well , my friend . You want it that way ; you 've chosen your course . But do n't forget I warned you . And I do n't mind telling you you 're lying by the clock . Even a child can see that . " " It 's the truth , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The anger and defiance were gone no  --  one or hidden ? ; all he wanted was for me to go away . I decided to gratify his desire up to a point ; I would leave temporarilyto go visit the wash room . " Excuse me , " I said . " I 'm going to the can and I 'll expect to see you here when I come back . " 125chapter 20I was mildly surprised to find him there upon my return and I wasted no time in boring in . " How long did you work for Barney ? " I began . " Cheer up . See , that 's another question you can afford to answer truthfully . I can check it and it surely ca n't hurt anything any-way . " Tonelessly : " Eighteen months . " " I lad you known him before that ? " " No . I just blew in . He needed a bartender and I got the job . " " Who are you working for now ? " After a pause , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely somebody is in charge of this joint . Who is he ? Or are you the new boss man ? " " It 's a woman . " I felt a small inward jolt of recognition . Of course , a woma  --  here simply had to be a dame . Why had n't I thought of that before ? Well , a man could n't think of everythin  --  nd during trout season women were the farthest thing from my mind . Well , almost the farthest . . . . " This woman , " I said , " who is she ? " " Mary Pilant . You 'll find her upstairs . She 's running things up there . Sh  --  he was Barney 's hostess . " He had hesitated ever so little over the word " hostess . " It opened up new vistas . " Is sh  --  s she going to own the place now ? " " I would n't know , " he said . " I 'm just a dumb bartender , you know . I just work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not so dumb , " I said . " But we 'll pass that ; I can find that out easily enough elsewhere . " " You can ? " he said , looking surprised . " IIow ? " " By checking the files in probate court or the records in the register of deeds office down in Iron Bay . Or else by wiring the Liquor ControlCommission in Lansing regarding any pending application for the transfer of your liquor license . And there are other ways . We live in an age of papers and records , you know ; one ca n't even properly die these clays without some notary or other clamping his official seal on the corpse . But it seems a shame , does n't it , to put me to all that needless bother ? " I paused . " Come , Alphonse , does she own the joint ? Do n't mar our budding new friendship by making me suspect you 're holding out on me . " " Barney left a will , " he said resignedly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact I know he did . It 's still got to go through probate court and all , but I guess she 'll eventually get everything . " He spread out his thin supple hands as though to embrace the place . " Everything . " " Was this Mary person present during the shooting ? " " No . " " Hm . . . . Where was she ? " He dropped his eyes . " I really would n't know , " he replied , and I made a mental note to check on that one . I had a sudden hunch . " This will , Alphonse , " I said , " were you one of the witnesses to it ? " he looked startled . " How do you know that ? " I laughed . " I have lived , Alphonse , I have lived . And when did Barney make out this will that you witnessed , Alphonse ? Or would you prefer me to check up on that myself ? " " About three weeks befor  --  efore he was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and divorced . Long ago . Down in Wisconsin . " " Any parents ? " " Both dead . " " Any children ? " He smiled fleetingly , and I put the smile away in cold storage . So Barney had been that way . . . . " I think there was a daughter , " he said . " Did he leave any other relatives and did any of them show up for the funeral ? " " He was buried down in Wisconsin . " " Very well , but my question had two horns , " I said . " How about the relatives ? " He glanced nervously in the direction of the stairway . " Besides the divorced wife and daughter there may have been a married sister . I do n't know nothing about that . " He stirred uneasily ; oddly enough , this new subject seemed to bother him more than the shooting itself . I paused and lit another Italian cigar , pondering this swift change in the picture . The plot , like homemade French pea soup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left any will his daughter would get everything ; that was plainly the law ; she would be his sole heir . If he left no wife , and willed everything to a stranger , then the stranger would get everything and the daughter nothing ; that was equally the law . But if a relative or guardian or someone contested126 127and could somehow successfully block the wil  --  ecause of coercion , undue influence , fraud , drunkenness , mental incapacity and the like ? then the will would fall and the daughter take all . And the stakes were certainly high enoug  --  prosperous and well kept summer hotel located on the main tourist beat . In any will contest , too , the witnesses to the will would hold importan  --  nd valuable trumps . A light was beginning to dawn . " Wino was the other witness to the will ? " I said . " ' Hie night clerk upstairs . " It was almost too neat ; this left Mary Pilant and her loyal employeessolely in the driver 's seat . I decided to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause  --  f all this reticence . Could it be from fear of someone upsetting the will ? " How about Barney 's drinking ? " I said . he threw out his hands . " He drank some . Most people in this businessalmost have to . " " Yes , I suppose . Like the well-known fact that proprietors of candystoreshang around all day eating candy , " I said . " But on the day of the shootin  --  ow about his drinking then ? " " He drank about the same as usual . In fact he drank about the same amount every day . " " Look , friend , one could truthfully say that about a quart-a-dayman , or even a hopeless drunk . The question is : how much was he drinking ? " " If you mean he was drunk , he was n't . He 'd had his regular quota . " Patiently : " And how much was that ? " " Oh , a few shots more or less . " " I-cell , man , do n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura Manion alone . What in hell was he doing behind the bar for an hour buying house drinks and al  --  wiggling soda pop ? But we 'll pass that for now and take up this interesting Mary person ? what was she to Barney ? " Ile smiled a tight knowing little smile . " Why do n't you go ask her ? She 's very friendly . I 've already told you she was his hostess . " He glanced quickly at the clock over the bar . " Excuse me , I 've got to go unlock the street door . " He sighed . " It 's about time for the tourist gang to show up . " It was 11:30 and the sign on the door had said 12:00 . Did my nervous friend want to let the tourist herd in simply so that he might be interrupted ? I decided to let it pass . Instead of unlocking the outside door Alphonse Paquette had quickly scampered up the stairs to the hotel , doubtless to warn the heiress apparent , Mary Pilant , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alone in the big empty barroom , whereupon all the malty frustrated yearnings and boozy instincts implanted in me by generations of sturdy distillers and brewers and saloonkeepers by the name of Biegler swept suddenly over me ; I found myself glidingbehind the bar as though drawn by a magnet . " Hm . . . . " Isaid , and paused . On the floor in the middle of the bar was a large dark blotch . That would be the spot where Barney had fallen . I carefully studied the bar at this point . Then I knelt and surveyed the situation from that position . " Hm . . . . " About six inches below the surface of the bar itself , near the bar service station and out of sight of anyone standing in front , I found a narrow wooden shelf about four feet long . I whistled softly and leaned closer . It was made of wood inferior ta that of the bar itself and had been added later , crudely added , I saw , . as though the job had been done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it held a forlorn collection of assorted salt and peppershakers and mustard jars . But it could also , I plainly saw , have held a small arsenal of firearms , yes , even a sawed-off shotgun or short rifle in a pinch . It could even have held a brace of pistols . I turned my back on the bar , facing the bar mirror and bottle shelf . The mirror seemed intact . I craned over the rows of bottles , on my tiptoes . There was a neat small splintered hole near the base of the mirror , about the heigh  --  e  --  f a man 's heart . If this had been caused by one of my man 's shots , then at least one of the bottles . should have been broken . As I walked out from behind the bar I felt like Sherlock Holmes and longed for a curved bulldog pipe and one of those fore-and-aft-peaked deer-stalker 's caps . Yes , damn it , and ' a checkered tattersall vest . Someone was rattling at the locked street door . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there , sagging with thirst , eyes glazed and tongue parched and dangling . I longed to slip a pair of frilled elastic garters over my shirt sleeves and let him in and then scamper back behind the bar , palms down and elbows out . " What 's yores , pardner ? " I would say as he advanced . I shook my head . " Down , Grandpa , down , " I thought ; this was no time to be playing at saloonkeeper . It struck me that the bartender and his new boss must be having . quite a huddle . And the need must have been pressing for them to , leave me alone with all this wealth of booze . I felt touched and hon-128 129ored by this subtle testimonial to my honesty and sobriety . The thirsting door-rattler had given up and gone away , but I took solace in the knowledge that he had but a short way to go to find another oasis . I walked over towards the door and stood by the table and windowwhere the bartender had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstructed my view and I stooped to what I judged to he the height of the shorter Paquette . Ah , the view was now fine ? I could sec outside and , turning slightly , also see the bar , a perfect place for a warning lookout . I glanced around . On the wall adjoining the door on the other side , closer to the bar , was a large bulletin board which appeared to be covered with various anouncements , scores , newspaper clippings , snapshots and the like . I quickly moved over that way and put on my glasses . I found myself shortly thinking of Max Battisfore , the Sheriff . For this bulletin board , I discovered , was a shrine apparently dedicated by Barney Quill to Barney Quill about Barney Quill ; it was devoted almost solely to celebrating his exploits as a fisherman , hunter , expertmarksman and , to a lesser extent , as a bowler , downhill skier , and racer of outboard motor-boats . And there had been many exploits ; there were dozens and scores of snapshots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attesting his prowess in all of these things and more : Barney Quill had won the turkey shoot the previous fall , he 'd won a skeet shoot , he 'd placed first in another pistol shoot ; he 'd skied the Iron Bay course in 1:53 . Over here Barney had shot the biggest buck at over two hundred yards ; Barney had caught the largest brook trout last season , and on a mere 5-X leader , too ( I read this particular item with an envious pang ) ; Barney and his outboard had won " I-le was really quite a guy , was n't he ? " a voice behind me said . Startled , I wheeled around . Alphonse Paquette , the bartender , had returned . " What nice soft shoes you wear , Grandma , " I said . IIe smiled faintly . " Have to wear ' em for my bunions . Standing all hours at that goddam bar , you know . " " And standing and enjoying the view from this goddam window when you 're not , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with Mary Pilant ? " I said , smiling . " Most satisfactory and to the point . She told me to keep my trap shut . No more questions and no more answers . Those were the lady 's order  --  nd she 's the boss . " Well , Mary Pilant might have been just a trifle late , I thought . I wondered what kind of witch she would be . Probably a pearl-laden dame with gold teeth and a baritone voice who shaved twice a week ; the kind who , after five minutes , started calling total strangers " darling " and " honey " and who wore long loopy earrings from which small boys could depend while performing gymnastics . The picture was not good ; maybe I could shove her off on Parnell . " Vv ell , " I said , " since you ca n't or wo n't talk I guess I might as well up and leave . It 's time for lunch , anyway . When a journeyman lawyer ca n't talk he 's in a bad way ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . " " So I 've noticed . " Something on the bulletin board had caught my eye . Caught and perplexed me . " But I have just one more question , an easy harmless little one , " I said . " And it demands no more cerebration than those certified questions on TV where people constantly win life annuities and round trips to Jamaica for guessing President Lincoln 's first name . Just one little question . " " Will you promise to lay off and go , then ? I 've got my work to do . " " On my honor as an Eagle Scout , " I said . " But I wo n't promise I wo n't be back . " He shook his head and sighed . " Shoot your damned question . You lawyers are boring in all the time . " " That 's the prettiest compliment I 've had since I retired from public life , " I said . " Thank you , Al . " I pointed at a large glossy unframedphotograph on the bulletin board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man , who had wavy hair which was graying at the temple  --  nd who was clearly Barney , I judged from the other picture  --  as smiling down at the woman , a stunning-lookingbrunette who was gravely regarding the camera . They were a striking , handsome-looking couple and I would have guessed they were married or in love except for one thin  --  he considerable disparityin their years ; I guessed that the man , in a pinch , was old enough to be her father . Could it be possible that this fragile and well-bred-appearing young woman was the scheming Mary Pilant ? " Is that Barney and Mary ? " I said . " That 's Barney and Mary , " he said . " I 've a good-looking boss , do n't you think ? " " Very , " I said , trying to hide my confusion over this sudden new development . The pea soup was getting thicker . " Now I go , " I said , 130 131 " like I promised , " and like a good Eagle Scout I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step and looked around . " One friendly tip , " 1 said , " not a question . " " What 's that ? " he said , with an elaborate show of patience . " Do n't remove the gun shelf from behind the bar . It 's too late ? I 've already seen it and it 'll only look worse if you take it out now . You should 've clone that before the police cam  --  t the same time you got rid of the pistols . " " Next murder I 'll remember to rehearse it , " he said . " You would n't want to play the part of the- dead body , would you ? It would be a real pleasure to have you . " " Only over your dead body , Buster , " I said , turning and trudging slowly up the stairs . Here was really quite an amiable character . Certainlynot dumb either ; perhaps only a little nervous . I wondered how much his cut would be if everything turned out all right . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Pilant any harm . Live and let live was my motto . No , no harm at al  --  ust so long as they did not foul up the defense of my murder case . But when they moved into that area there would really be war , charm or no charm . And it was beginning to look like war . I had told Mitch that this case had everything but Technicolor . It had been the prize understatement of the year . For Technicolor had now been added and its name was Mary Pilant . I quickened my step on the stair. chapter 21Hotels that aspire to look cozy and homelike generally succeed about as dismally as chain-bakeries fool anyone by calling their lumps of pumped-up dough Grandma Higgins ' homemade bread ; but insofar as any hotel can perhaps be made to look homelike , someone had almost succeeded with the Thunder Bay Inn . The place was actually attractive . Even with all the milling tourists there was an atmosphere of uncontrivcd hominess and cheer about it , especially about the lobby , that defied analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superb heads of three white-tailed deer over it ( Barney would undoubtedly have shot those ) , or the colorful and yet restful drapes at the large picture windowsoverlooking the blue expanse of lake , or the attractively paneled walls of unfinished red cedar that glowed and shone like burnished copper , or the carefully selected prints and photograph  --  nd even a few interesting water color  --  ll of which depicted scenes indigenousto the Peninsula rather than the usual tourist art showing fairy dream castles in Vales . Whatever the reason the room possessed undeniablecharm . Would the enigmatic Mary Pilant have had a hand in all this , I wondered . The lobby was crowded with people , including Maida , who was sitting by the fireplace oblivious to the clatter and turmoil around her , her nose buried in one of her inevitable mystery thrillers . Mysterythriller indeed , I thought . Here she was , working on a case that had more real mystery about it than a dozen contrived thrillers , a case as bristling with mystery as a porcupine with quill  --  nd she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old hermit Danny McGinnis incredulously glued to his story about his fellow hermit . True , in our case there was little mystery about what had actually taken plac  --  hat was becoming all too brutally apparent . But these facts , however melodramatic , skimmed but the surface , were in themselvesmerely the tip of the iceberg at sea ; it was the " inner facts , " the heart of the case itself , that teemed with the stuff of real mystery , the deepening tangle of dark impulses and mixed motives of real men and women . I glanced about . There was a milling group of vacantly staring people wandering aimlessly up and down , most of whom appeared to be carrying boxes of cleansing tissue . But where was all the Army132 133brass ? What had happened to the Army ? I went over to the lobby desk . The bespectacled clerk appeared to be playing a losing game of solitaire with a pack of registration cards . His rapt concentration plainly brooked no interruption . " Ah , cheating ! " I thought , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indecent interval he sighed and reshuffled the deck and looked up . " Yes ? " he inquired , with that fine mixture of condescension , boredom and inner pain that seems to be the trademark of hotel clerks the world over . " What happened to the Army ? " I said . " I do n't see any glittering brass . Has there been a new war ? " ' The Army has retreated , " he answered solemnly . " They cleared out yesterday , bag and baggage , thank goodness . " IIe rolled his eyes up , obviously a sorely put-upon man . " Nobody knows the troublesI 've had , " he seemed to be saying . " Was the retreat according to plan or because of the shooting of ? of Dangerous Dan McGrew ? " I said . " I thought the Army was supposedto stay here on maneuvers or something through September . " " The Army has not officially informed me of its reasons for departure , " he replied with enviable sarcasm . " All I know is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I asked casually , " were you on duty the night Barney was shot ? " He glanced sharply at me . " What 's that to you ? " he said coolly . " I 'm Lieutenant Manion 's lawyer , " I said . " Paul Biegler from Chippewa . " " Oh , " he said , shrugging . " I thought you might be another of those prying tourists . " " Smile when you say that , pardner , " I said , wincing . " But were you on duty ? " " Yes , I was ' on nights ' last week . " " Ali , a break at last , " I thought as I pressed rapidly on . " Do you remember when Barney came in ? How he was dressed ? His general appearance ? " Ile nodded his head . " I certainly do , " he said emphatically . " Barneycame running in the front entrance at just about ? " At this juncture a large soft blimp of a woman bustled herself squarely between us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , madam , we will serve lunch until one-thirty , " he explained patiently . " No , madam , we do not pack lunches for the road . No , madam , the check-out hour is four not five . Yes , madam , downstairs isthe place where the poor defenseless man ' was shot . " The clerk turned wearily back to mc . " You see how it is ? " he murmured . " They 're driving me simply insane . " " You were just saying . . . . " I began . At that moment a waitress hurried up to the desk , all but running , and spoke earnestly to the clerk . " Miss Pilant wants to see you in the dining roo  --  immediately ! " she said . " Yes , yes , of course , " he said , innocently trotting away to have his gag applied . So Mary Pilant wanted to play it that way , did she ? I turned ruefully , bitterly , upon the still-waiting lady tourist . " Excuse me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfying it would be to hoist her a nice slow kick in the blubber . I stalked away . So the Army had taken a powder , had it ? ? gone away , retreated before the superior fire power of Lieutenant Manion ? We were certainlygetting all the breaks . I had arrived a day late and now could n't find out what if anything the Army knew . And now even Mary Pilantwas getting in my hair . And how was this sudden flight of the Army going to affect our chances for getting one of their damned psychiatrists ? As I stood there morosely Parnell came charging into the lobby , wheezing and puffing like an old wood-burning loconiotivc , his broad face perspiring and red as a beet . I felt alarmed for him until I saw the look of wild triumph in his eye ; the old boy must have come up with something , all right ; he looked as proud and pleased as an old dog with a new bone . He brushed blindly past me and joined Maida at the fireplace , flopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite so overcome , I noted , that he forgot to display the tattersall vest for the bedazzled tourists . As I threaded my way glumly through the milling crowd to join Parnell and Maida I found my way blocked by the same lady tourist who had just interrupted the clerk and me . She was intently studying a large road map affixed to the wall , leaning over and thoughtfully scratching her fanny . The target was magnificent and I stood itchily weighing the possibilities for making a successful drop kick . . . . She was hoydenishly clad in Bermuda shorts large enough to sail the Kon-Tiki . She wore a bandana top and a girlish head scarf and on the incredibly tiny feet of her lumpy piano legs she wore some sort of gay open-toed sandals . She was , I saw , of the common or sun-worshipervariety of tourist , looking as though she had been but recently dipped , and held , in a boiling lobster pot . As Mencken once said , 134 135she was the sort of female that made a man want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , " I thought , studying this prize specimen of homo tourosis . " Flow ( 10 you like my new hair-do , Boss ? " Maida chirped amiably as I joined them. " line , " I conceded , " if looking like a curly blonde Zulu is an effectivedisguise for the undercover work you 're doing . But the jackpot quest ion is : are the results worth all the sacrifice ? Who are you trying to look like , Mata Hari on a drunk ? " She appealed to Parnell . " See , Parn , see , " she pouted . " Now you can sec why I 'm so starved for a kind word . " I stole a look at the still-scratching lady tourist . " On second thought , Maida , " I said , " you look positively ravishing . Pardon my outburs  --  ' ve just been through a harrowing experience . Let 's go eat and I 'll tell you . " As we entered the dining room a young woman came forward to meet us . I caught my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovelier in person than her photograph , small and poised , with wide intelligent dark eyes . " Three ? " she inquired politely . " Please , " I said . " And please , to  --  ar away from the tourists . " " Perhaps you would prefer to dine on the veranda , " she suggested . " We keep a few overflow tables set up out there . And there you will not only escape the tourists " ? she paused and smiled slightly ? " but be alone to talk . " " Thank you , " I said , smiling back . " That 's very thoughtful of you . By all means take us to the veranda . " As she led the way through the multitude of noisily feeding tourists I watched her with the kind of avid and rueful admiration that baldingmiddle-aged males bestow upon hopelessly unattainable young loveliness . I noted the poise and slender grace of her walk , the trim modeling of her legs and ankles , the small ears and small well-shaped head with the tendrils of dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of pent and brooding intelligence of her face . Yes , poise and grace and intelligence was the verdict for Mary Pilant . And how , I wondered , how had a character like Barney Quill ever . . . ? Why , he was even older than I. I sighed and recalled Justice Holmes 's classic comment to Justice Brandeis . The two had been out for a Washington stroll . A pert little stenographer had overtakenand gone tripping past them , her bouncing little hams andpartridge breasts all contributing their part . " Ah , Louis , Louis , " the great Holmes had sighed , shaking his leonine head regretfully . " Ah , to be seventy again . . . . " Right now I would have gladly settled for forty . " Here we are , " Mary Pilant said , pausing at a tastefully laid table which commanded a breathless view of the lake . " Thank you , young lady , " I said . " What a lovely outlook . I see I must come here more often . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling . " We have many points of interest in our little town . " " So I 've observed , " I said . " I 've already been investigating some of them , as you may have heard . But I 'm sure there are many more ? that is if my view should not be too much obstructed . " She held my eyes for an instant as I watched licr faintly mocking smile . It was like a game of chess . " 1 ' 11 send you a waitress in a minute , " she said , turning away . " Who 's that ? " Maida said as soon as she had left . " Who is that adorable creature ? And what kind of verbal sparring were you two up to ? It sounded like Esperanto to me . " " That 's Mary Pilant , " I said . " She used to be Barney Quill 's hostess . I 'll get to the sparring part later . " Parnell had grown rather quiet . " Lovely , lovely , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maida 's eyes had widened with wonder and envy . " So that 's the woman in the case , " she murmured . "  --  guess I had half expected a two-headed female monster , some sort of scheming witch . " " I know what you mean , " I said . " Tell me , " I went on , " tell me what you learned about her ? There 's something here that does n't add up . Maida had learned plenty . She had to wait over half an hour for her turn at the beauty parlor . The place was crowded with beautystarvedfemales , both tourists and locals , besides the half-dozen-odd employees . " The place was like a steambath . " And all of them were buzzing about the shooting of Barney Quill ; it was just about all they had talked about . " What was the burden of their chatter , Maida ? " I said . " We can cover the details later . " " Well , " Maida began , " according to some stories this Mary person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there seems to be considerable doubt on that score . " 136 137Parnell spoke up . " When any group of females clacking in a beauty parlor in any degree ever spares one of their sisters , " he observed dryly , " they have created , I should say , a tremendous doubt on that score . " I glanced quickly at Parnell . Had he fallen for Mary ? If so , that would make two of us . . . . " Who is she , Maida , where is she from ? " I went on . " It seems that she came to Thunder Bay several summers ago with a group of vacationing schoolteachers , " Maida continued . " She must be a livin ' doll , because Barney fell for her like a ton of brick  --  o the word goe  --  nd made her boss lady of the place and of all the college-girl waitresse  --  t twice her schoolteacher pay . When her own gang of schoolteachers went back to their brats she remained behind as Barney 's hostess , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame him , " Parnell said thoughtfully . He sighed heavily and again his gaze wandered out over the glittering lake . " Sh  --  he reminds me of someone I once knew , " he said slowly , " ? over a million years ago . . " I again glanced quickly at Parnell . Was he referring to his own lost Nora ? If so perhaps I could now understand and view his checkeredcareer in a new light . " But if Barney cared so much for Mary Pilant , " I said , " how come he did this terrible thing to Laura Manion ? What 's the story on that ? " " Well , " Maida said , " there 're half a dozen stories on that : one , that Barney was half-crazed with drink , again that Laura Manion had led him on that night and even before , then again that this rape routine was just an old trick of Barney 's with summer tourists . Then there 's the school of scandal in reverse that claims he did n't even rape or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a ravening wolf . " Maida paused . " On this wolf business I even suspect that the girl who worked on me knew personally whereof she spoke . I seemed to detect a note of wistfulness . " " Will the Voice of Experience please proceed ? " I said . " The most persistent story I heard was that Barney had simply blown his stack over the thought of losing Mary Pilan  --  hat she somehow , in some way , triggered the whole explosion . " Maida paused and lowered her voice . " Here comes the waitress ! " she hissed , as artfully as Mata Hari herself . I waited impatiently for the waitress to take our order and depart . " What do you mea  --  bout Barney losing her , about her triggering any explosion ? " " The story is that Mary Pilant had recently taken up with some young Army officer with Lieutenant Manion 's outfi  --  second-Ionic called Loftus , Sonny Loftus they called hi  --  nd that Barney had tried to break it off . One version is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also give her this hote  --  ut that she had refused to stop seeing the young officer and was even about to leave or had threatened to do so . It 's all gossip , of course , but I guess in these real small towns you ca n't even yawn iii decent privacy . And here I thought Chippewa was had enough . " She paused and smiled slyly . " And I do manage to yawn there occasionally . . . . " Go on , " I said . " Leave us not pause now to hear the diverting story of your secret love life . Remember , the trial is next month . " " You make a point , Boss , " Maida amiably agreed . " All the stories seem to agree that Barney had lately started to drink heavil  --  t seems the man could always carry a tremendous loa  --  ight up until the night Laura Manion had wandered into the bar to play pinball . " " But wh  --  hy did he do this ? " I said , more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  r win hac  --  he lovely Mary by doingsuch a spectacularly evil thing ? " " That 's the burning mystery , " Maida said . " ' That 's what 's got everybody baffled . " She shook her head . " It beats Inc , Boss . " " Perhaps Barney was really the one that needed a psychiatrist , " I said , half to myself . Parnell spoke slowly , " In a way it seem  --  t almost seems as though the Manions wandered onto the stage of a Greek drama in which they had no part , indeed a drama upon which the curtain had already nearly fallen . " Shrewd old Parnell , I thought . " Well said , Pam , " i agreed , as he beamed with pleasure . " It looks more and more like the Manions may have been mere innocently casual pawns in some bigger , more mysterious game . It 's up to us to try to find out about the game . It may hold the solution . " Yet I wondered what all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Assuming we learned all , so what ? And why was Mary Pilant so apparently bent on shielding Barney ? Or was it to shield Barney ? Was it rather to make sure that the will was not upset , that she would ultimately get all the swag for herself ? I shook my head dubiously . Such avid and calculated avarice somehow did n't seem138
