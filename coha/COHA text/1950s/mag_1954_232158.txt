In the Yankee dugout , Charles Dillon Stengel , visiting " Perfessor " from The Bronx , shuffled , scratched and sprawled elegantly , then announced in learned accents that any fool could see who was holding those Cleveland Indians up in first place . Old Casey scowled across the green infield of Cleveland 's Municipal Stadium : " That young feller , " he gestured grandly , " that feller 's a ball player . He 'll give you the works every time . Gets all the hits , gives you the hard tag in the field . That feller 's a real competitor , you bet your sweet curse life . " <P> Out of the Doldrums . Anyone familiar with Casey 's floating pronouns knew his man : First Baseman Al Rosen , 29 , a scramble-nosed pro whose seasoned ability was the main reason why the Cleveland Indians were at the top of the American League . For a couple of disconcerting days last week , Rosen and the Indians faltered before the class and drive of the rejuvenated Yankees ; they lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in first place , and Cleveland 's long-suffering fans still clung boisterously to the notion that this was the Indians ' year . <P> For three straight years the club started the race like champions . For three straight years they folded in the stretch . This year they did not even start well . Ten games into April , they had won only four . The man who prodded them out of the doldrums was Al Rosen . The American League Most Valuable Player of last year , Al Rosen , third baseman , made a quick switch to first , played like a practiced veteran , and opened a spot in the lineup for a flashy , hard-hitting rookie named Rudy Regalado . The Indians started after the lead . Now that Regalado is slumping at bat , Manager Al Lopez has another capable first baseman , ex-Oriole Vic Wertz , so he can safely bench Regalado and send Rosen back to third . <P> The Hard Way . Rosen 's old-pro versatility has not come easy . As a prewar bush-leaguer he seemed so hopeless in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Listen , kid , you 'd better go home and get yourself a lunch pail . Forget about baseball . You either have it or you do n't . You do n't . " Al ignored the advice . <P> He was used to doing things the hard way . As a Florida schoolboy he was an all-around athlete , but he had to sandwich his sports in between part-time jobs . He played baseball on American Legion teams at 11 , was a semi-pro at 14 ( mainly because of his ability with a bat ) , and still found time to help support his family . For a while he was a slat-painter in a venetian-blind factory . <P> Not until 1950 , with three years in the Navy and five years in the minor leagues behind him , did Al catch on as a Cleveland regular . Even then , it was his powerful bat that made him . In the field , Rosen admits , " I 've got to work and keep thinking . When I do n't , I 'm bush league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
