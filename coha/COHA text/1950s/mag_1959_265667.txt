Treasury Secretary Robert Anderson won his first victory last week in his campaign to remove the 4% interest-rate ceiling on long-term Government bonds . The House Ways &; Means Committee approved a bill to permit the President to ignore the ceiling when necessary to sell bonds . The committee tacked on an amendment expressing the " sense of Congress " that the Federal Reserve Board should expand the nation 's credit supply by pegging the price of Government bonds . Cried Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin Jr. : " This is an attack on the independence of the Federal Reserve Board . This is a directive for printing-press money . " <P> Behind Martin 's alarm lay an attempt by easy-money advocates in Congress to use the Government 's bond crisis ( TIME , June 15 ) to put pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to go back to the wartime policy of supporting the market for Government bonds . The Fed now buys short-term Treasury bills only . The Fed believes that if it bought bonds now , without wartime controls on spending , it would pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the boom by tightening credit . <P> Easy-money Democrats , led by Congressman Lee Metcalf of Montana , insisted on an amendment recognizing the Federal Reserve 's " primary mission " of administering sound money , but demanded that the Fed " bring about needed future monetary expansion " by buying Government securities of varying maturities instead of , as it has been doing , lowering reserve requirements . <P> The Treasury announced that it could ive with the bill , but the Fed 's Martin urged the Treasury not to let Congress make a start at dictating the independent Fed 's monetary policy . Martin pointed out that it would be very bad for the Government 's credit if the financial community , here and abroad , got the idea that the U.S. had officially embarked on a soft-money policy . At week 's end the Treasury was swinging around to Martin 's stand , felt that taking the Metcalf amendment was worse than having no bill at all .                   @ @
