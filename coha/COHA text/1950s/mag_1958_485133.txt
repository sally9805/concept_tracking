It is like a scene from The Godfather . Every weekend , a seemingly endless procession of slowly moving cars parades down Sherbrooke Street in Montreal 's East End , turns right along Pie IX Boulevard , and left again along Boyce . The people in the cars are looking at the soaring ribs and girders of the unfinished Olympic Stadium , and all around the stadium the ground  --  now churned into a sea of mud from the trucks and the cranes moving tons of concrete and steel  --  that everyone ' prays will turn into the Olympic Park in time for the 21st Summer Olympic Games next July . The citizens of Montreal are worried . According to the most recent estimates , the final bill for the games is likely to be in excess of a billion dollars , and opposition members in City Hall have charged that if the indirect costs  --  delayed public housing , sewage facilities and Metro extensions  --  are included , the true costs are closer to a Stupendous $2 billion ! All this for a sports meet that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of what happened in Montreal , how a scheme to stage a " modest " Olympics grew into a nightmare of Desmond Smith , a frequent contributor to The Nation , is the author of Smith 's Moscow and Smith 's Montreal , the latter scheduled for publication in the spring ( both Knopf ) . costly overruns , has important implications not only for the fmancing of future Olympics but also as providing a look at a potentially dangerous trend in municipal government : the use of so-called " self-financing " schemes in order to avoid direct citizen approval of major projects . In May 1970 , there were three contenders for the honor of staging the 1976 Olympic Games : Los Angeles , Moscow and Montreal . Few Montrealers gave Jean Drapeau , the feisty Mayor ' of Montreal , much chance , - Sam Yorty , then Mayor of Los Angeles , had put on a California-style public relations campaign to win the bid . He offered not only financial guarantees but also pointed out that 1976 was America 's Bicentennial year and reminded the International Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the , Olympics once before , in 1932 , generally remembered as one of the greatest of all , Olympiads . Mayor Vladimir Promyslov of Moscow told the IOC that the capital of the USSR had all the facilities needed for the 1976 games already in place  --  and , of course , it would be no problem at all to guarantee satisfactory financing . Drapeau , a speech maker in the tradition ' of William Jennings Bryan , appealed to the IOC to return to the modest ideals of the games ' founder , Baron Pierre Coubertin . He pointed out that guarantees were actually harmful , and " not in the spirit of the Baron 's Olympicism . " If Montreal got the Olympics , he told the committee , politics would be kept out of the games ( a crack at the two superpoWers ) . Canada 's largest city would , instead , stage a " modest " games , ' concentrating on their " spiritual " aspects . The Mayor wound up his appeal by declaring : " In extending its invitation , Montreal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first ballot it was Moscow 28 , Montreal 25 , L.A. 17 . Then Montreal won when the city with the fewest votes was eliminated , Montreal beating Moscow 41 to 28 . Without offering a dime in financial guarantees , with no stadium and few other athletic facilities , Mayor Drapeau had won the games for Montreal ; for the first time in their history , they were to be held on Canadian soil . The Mayor returned home to a hero 's welcome and , in a memorable ' speech , promised Montrealers that the 1976 games would not cost them " one cent " in additional taxes . They would , he promised ; be entirely " self-financing . " We do n't have to worry about the Olympic village because it can be covered with federal urban renewal funds , " Drapeati explained . : ' We do n't need to worry about infrastructure because that was built for Expo in 1967 , and the stadium wo n't count because the city is committed to build one for baseball anyway . " Our television rights estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be enough to cover our operating expenses . " At the time , nobody questioned the Mayor 's arithmetic . Now , according to protocol , each country that accepts the Olympic Games has an Olympic committee . The Olympic Charter describes national Olympic committees as nonprofit organizations responsible for the development and ' protection of both the Olympic movement and amateur sport . Following the selection of Montreal , the Canadian Olympic Association ( COA ) became responsible for organizing and staging the games . But something curious happened . The COA delegated the assignment to a special " organizing ' committee " known as " COJO , " Comite Organisateur des Jeux Olympiques , which promptly moved into the old Palais de Justice building next door to City Hall . If anyone had imagined that the Mayor would turn over the Olympics to a bunch of amateur sports officials , they just did not know the Mayor of Montreal . Whoever controlled the organizing committee controlled the games , and Drapeau  --  without accepting any official position at COJO ? controlled it absolutely . Drapeau , at 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five terms , is no longer the autocrat he was before the 1975 municipal elections , when a coalition of citizen groups broke his 99 per cent control of the City Council and put eighteen members of the Montreal Citizens Movement ( MCM ) into City Hall . But even if the council no longer automatically rubber-stamps every mayoral decision , Drapeau still runs a machine that is the most successful in Canadian urban politics , and that still has power not only in provincial but in federal affairs . His achievements are many . Among them are : the cleaning up in the mid-1950s of one of the most corrosively corrupt cities in North America ; the gigantic urban renewal programs of the early 1960s , which revitalized the core of Montreal ; Expo ' 67 , possibly the most imaginative world 's fair ever held , which brought uncounted millions of tourist revenues to the city  --  revenues that persist to this day , since Drapeau never really closed Expo , which reopens every summer as " Man and His World . " Uncorruptible , given to working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympics as the crowning achievement of two decades of public service . From the start , the federal and , provincial governments told Montreal that they would not subsidize the games . Drapeau , in turn , renewed his pledge to Montrealers that he was not seeking Olympic financing from them . In retrospect , many people now realize that this pledge gave the Mayor complete freedom of action , no questions asked . One of his first actions was to ignore Quebec architects and give the major share of the Olympic design work ( including the stadium ) to a little-known but flamboyant French architect named Roger Taillibert . Meanwhile , in March 1971 , COJO revenue chief Gerry Snyder , an old political ally of the Mayor , gave the first hint of what the Olympic complex would be like . The , press was informed that whatever Munich was doing ( Munich 's 1972 Olympic plans called for expenditures of more than $600 million ) Montreal would not follow suit . The games were to be a modest affair  --  an- Olympic village for 14,000 people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a $6-million pool and a $2-million velodrome for the cycling events . - Financial details were kept deliberately vague . As Jean Drapeau told William Johnson of Sports Illustrated at the time : " I do not like to be specific if it can be avoided . I have dealt only in large round numbers . I say $250 million for the construction of all the permanent installations , ' and I do not break it down . " With the architect in Paris-3,000 miles away from the curious press  --  busily working away on designs known only to a few chosen insiders , Jean Drapeau quickly got down to funding the project . To raise the estimated $310 million needed to fmance the games , Drapeau went to Ottawa where he got some important concessions from the Liberal government of Prime Minister Trudeau . Among these , the government authorized an Olympic coin and stamp program , promised to supply security for the games , provided $25 million toward the broadcasting costs and , most important of all , authorized a nationwide Olympic lottery . Back in Montreal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for the first time ever , the Olympics were to be merchandised just like any other sports event . Although no one can use the official Olympic symbol in advertising , COJO designed a special Montreal games symbol  --  the five intertwined rings surmounted by three half-rings that make up the letter M for Montreal . Among the hundreds of corporate " sponsors " entitled to use this symbol in their advertising and promotion campaigns are General Motors , Xerox , Canon ( the " official " camera of the Olympics ) , Coca-Cola , the " official " drink of the athletes , Tetley Tea ( official supplier of tea produets ) , RCA , and the list runs on . A recent handout from COJO 's press office proudly announced that the William Wrigley Jr . Co . Ltd. had been appointed official supplier of chewing gum to the 1976 games , and that for the first time at any Olympics athletes would eat from disposable plates and cutlery provided by the Lily Cup Corporation . COJO had less luck selling the rights to televise the games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record for North American TV rights , but the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) , negotiating on behalf of the rest of the world 's broadcasters , refused to match that sum . Their position was simple : the Olympics were not a commercial event , and they were not going to pay commercial rates . In the end , after a year of acrimony , COJO reluctantly accepted an EBU offer of $10 million , " take it or leave it . " While the fund-raising program was having its ups and downs ( the lottery was going well , but the coin program was in trouble , largely because of the recession in the United States ) , Mayor Drapeau , secretive as ever , went to Vienna to meet the International Olympic Committee and finally unveil his plans for the Olympic Games . Drapeau 's big surprise was his Olympic stadium , an enormous doughnut-shaped structure , surmounted by an 18-story tower capped by a revolving restaurant . Ever since Houston opened its $31-million Astrodome a decade ago , a kind of " dome envy " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammoth sports emporia are rising . They are the newest form of North American urban macho . Of them all , Montreal 's Olympic stadium  --  big enough to accommodate London 's St. Paul 's Cathedral under its massive 10-acre retractable roof  --  was ' to be by far the grandest . But was a Superdome necessary for the Olympics ( the 18 stories of training facilities and the revolving restaurant would not be open in time for the games ) , or was ' Montreal 's wily Mayor simply using the games  --  and a federally approved lottery  --  to build the kind of spectacular sports facility that would normally require financing out of municipal bonds ? Critics charged Drapeau with enriching Montreal at the expense of the rest of Canada ? and , on a nationwide open-line radio show , a listener in Vancouver called Jean Drapeau " the greatest con artist Canada had ever produced . " The Mayor , a man seldom lost for words , on this occasion said nothing . Meanwhile in Montreal there was bad news at the Olympic site , where a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation in thirty years , had sent prices skyrocketing . By July , Doug Gilbert , the city 's most knowledgeable sports columnist , was writing in The Gazette : " Help ! Jean Drapeau , the man who brought us Expo and the Expo 's ' Man and His World ' and The Lottery System , has lost control of the financing formula for next year 's 1976 Olympics . " Drapeau went to Quebec City , the provincial capital , to try to explain to Parliament what had gone wrong . The velodrome ( original estimate $2 million ) was coming in at $60 million ; underground parking lots were now tabbed at $42.1 million ; a simple overpass ( built to provide security for the athletes ) was listed at $12.7 million , and the Olympic stadium's. price tag had soared to a stratospheric $277.6 million estimate , a figure that was to be boosted in November to $375 million , with an ultimate cost ( including interest charges ) of a mind-blowing $600 million ! ? the world 's most expensive sports structure . In all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that figure is now considered conservative . Finally , last month the province assumed responsibility for the games and the tangled skein of finances , and Mayor Jean Drapeau was edged out of the spotlight . The government 's takeover , does nothing at all for Montreal taxpayers ; it means only that the Olympic installations will be guaranteed , but leaving Montrealers with a multimillion-dollar debt for its construction . By now , it is obvious that Drapeau 's " self-financing " is doomed to failure and a $400 million to $500 million deficit is expected . The Olympic lottery , the single biggest source of revenue , must be phased out when the games close ( although there are plans to continue it as a provincial lottery after August 1976 ) , and in Montreal 's financial district the bankers are waiting . The city desperately needs to float a new municipal bond for such public works as a new sewage system . Its supply of short term notes is just about exhausted  --  almost $400 million has been diverted to " bridging " loans to Olympic contractors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the major bond-rating agency  --  is looking at Montreal 's finances and the rumor is that the city , currently classified a single A ( compared to Toronto 's triple A ranking ) may be further downgraded . These are not good days for Mayor Drapeau , and they are even worse for the taxpayers . The Olympics  --  still six months away  --  will not be postponed . Everyone from the Premier of the province , Mr. Bourassa , to the beleaguered Mayor , is committed to see the games through . Meanwhile , in Montreal 's grimy East End , the Olympic Stadium is a kind of universal power plant , sucking in money and spewing out concrete . As the giant mechanism pumps away , few city services  --  or few Montrealers  --  can escape its effect . Everything from park , maintenance to teachers ' salaries has been affected by the price of the Olympics , and still the frightening drain on the city budget continues . The subject of what went wrong with Montreal 's Olympic planning will no doubt be discussed as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question in my mind , " said a banker with close ties to the Drapeau administration , " as to whether the Mayor had the right to risk the city 's credit on the Olympic installations without full disclosure at the outset . " There are , however , larger questions of executive respon ; sibility for the well-being of the city . The speed with which things occur in a city like Montreal have already rendered useless the archaic city charter . Created a century ago , Montreal 's charter is dedicated to the idea that the weaker a City Council the less harm it can do , and that has meant that the Chief Executive can say and do pretty much whathe wants . - Montreal  --  like many North American cities  --  grants an awesome amount of real power to the office of Mayor . As it happened , Drapeau 's " self-financing " scheme had all the substance of a South Sea bubble , but such was ( and is ) the mayoral power that prudent inhibitions against risk are weakened while initiative is sustained . The near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to keep management techniques in the Mayor 's office developing at the same pace as the projects they must control ; at the same time ; Montreal 's Olympic " experience " confirms that you ca n't run a modern city with a century-old set of guidelines . Finally , it is a depressing fact , but a true one , that Munich  --  four years after its $600-million experience  --  is still saddled with a quite enormous debt . Can any non-Communist city afford to stage Olympic games ? Unless a new formula is designed , the Olympics seem doomed to becoming an ever more " commercial " venture , if they are to be staged in the West . Already the athletes are getting restless . As Billy Jean King recently told the President 's Commission on Olympic Sports , " Amateur athletes have become ' the pawn of manipulators and big business . " According to Mrs. King , Olympic athletes should get 40 per cent of the gate receipts , " because without the athletes there is no money , no entertainment package to sell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems reasonably clear that their future will be determined by what happens in Montreal . In the meantime , Montrealers have a more immediate headache  --  how to foot the bill for the biggest and most expensive sports extravaganza in history . ?
