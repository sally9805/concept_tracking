THE FIRESIDE BOOK OF FLYING STORIES ( 464 pp. ) - Edited by Paul Jensen-Simon &; Schuster ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> One day in 1844 , a desperately hard-up writer named Edgar Allan Poe submitted a sensational story to the New York Sun . A coal-gas balloon " employing the principle of the Archimedean screw , " he said , had crossed the Atlantic Ocean in three days . The gullible Sun splashed this fantasy over its front page ; two days later it ruefully apologized . <P> The Poe hoax-in retrospect , guilty only of being 75 years premature*-leads off this easygoing anthology of flying life and lore . Editor Jensen , a World War II fighter pilot , has rummaged high &; low for a collection which should leave flying buffs cooing happily and give even the uninitiated an occasional kick . <P> Tom Swift &; Friends . The best thing about the book is its lack of pretentiousness : Jensen has avoided high-flown speculations about the metaphysics and poetry of flight , has sensibly followed a straight chronological pattern . His opening section mixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Dos Passes dithyramble ( from The Big Money ) on the Wright brothers , a pleasantly batty story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on an " air jungle " high over Britain , and a tale about Tom Swift taking " his girl up , which opens with the classic line : " Oh , Tom , is it really safe ? " <P> The second and best part , " The Gentlemen Killers , " focuses on World War I. " For a short time , " writes Jensen , " a rather warped form of chivalry existed which made it poor form to fire on an opponent whose guns or engine were not functioning properly . " The German ace , Ernst Udet , remembers how his French peer , Georges Guynemer , refused to fire when Udet 's guns jammed . And Floyd Gibbons vibrates excitedly over the death of the greatest German ace of World War I , Baron Manfred von Richthofen . <P> Combat &; Psychology . After the war came an era of reckless barnstorming and adventuring . Editor Jensen has unaccountably omitted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death Drag . But he has snagged some other good things : Anne Lindbergh reminisces about a weird Alaskan flight ; Antoine de Saint-Exupery describes a Patagonian cyclone ; and James Thurber , in his wonderful story , The Greatest Man in the World , draws a satiric profile of Pal Smurch , the cocky little urchin who flew nonstop around the world-the adulation went to his head so badly that he had to be pushed out the window . <P> Somewhat surprisingly , the stories about World War II flying make dull reading , perhaps because aerial combat had become so formalized that one account seems pretty much like another . But Editor Jensen has dug up two first-rate items for his closing sections . Someone Like You is a poignant sketch of battle fear by Roald Dahl , a onetime R.A.F. pilot . And in The Three Secrets of Flight , Wolfgang Langewiesche , a onetime test-pilot , offers a superbly lucid discussion of the psychological adjustments men must make to survive in the air . <P> <P> * The first airship crossing of the Atlantic came in 1919 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas ) took 4 days to fly from the Firth of Forth to Mineola , Long Island .
