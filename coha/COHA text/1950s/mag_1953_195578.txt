When the University of Houston started out as a four-year institution in 1934 , it had 909 students and one big shack on the San Jacinto High School campus . It also had one unusual asset : Vice President Walter W. Kemmerer . A Ph.D . from Columbia , Kemmerer was a blunt go-getter who thought he knew exactly what sort of university Houston should have . <P> As the driving force behind its philosophy ( " We will teach anybody anything he wants " ) , he offered everything from a six-hour course in cafeteria sanitation to an eight-year course leading to a Ph.D . He made friends with Oilman Hugh Roy Cullen , channeled some of Cullen 's millions into a vast new campus . He put up buildings for the colleges of law , pharmacy , nursing and optometry , saw the university 's enrollment rise to 13,000 . <P> In 1950 , when President E. E. Oberholtzer retired , everyone at Houston seemed agreed on his successor . Kemmerer was made acting president and later president . His formal inauguration was all set for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board of regents summoned him . He was too blunt , too fast , said the regents . They wanted his resignation . <P> Kemmerer had no alternative ( " When they do n't want me , " he had often said , " I 'll resign " ) . But when the announcement came out last week , his old campus seemed to adjust quickly to the news . For many months , a large segment at Houston had been advocating a new philosophy : the university is a big place now , and it needs a big name to head it . The case , said one Houstonian , is really quite simple : " Kemmerer has built the school into something bigger than himself . "
