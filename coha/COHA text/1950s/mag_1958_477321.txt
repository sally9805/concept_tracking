WHEN John Tee-Van ? General Director of that wonderful collection of birds , mammals , and reptiles known the world over as New York 's Bronx Zoo ? drives his 1955 green Ford through the service gate of the New York Zoological Park a little before nine every morning , he enters a world of 251 rolling acres of woodland inhabited by 2,631 living creatures whose welfare and happiness are his peculiar responsibility . The Zoo does n't open to the public until ten , and when the Director makes his daily inspection tour along the footpaths , which are barely wide enough to accommodate his car , a cool freshness prevails , broken only by the varied morning calls of birds and beasts . An occasional small truck scoots past , bringing food to the animal keepers , or supplies to the cafeterias . The paths are neat and clean ; shutters are fastened tight on kiosks where souvenirs , books , and animal food will soon be dispensed ; the track where the camels , ponies , donkeys , and llamas will shortly furnish rides for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the food pavilions are stacked upside clown on tables ; and keepers are hosing the animal cages . Dr. Tee-Van likes every hour of the day , but at this particular time he displays a lyrical and light-hearted attitude toward his charges which is apt to be submerged later under a pile of detail work . " What a marvelous creature ! " he exclaimed recently to a visitor making the morning rounds with him , when he drove up to the Great Apes House and got out of the car in front of the outdoor yard where Oka , the gorilla , was sunning herself . " Hello , Oka , how 's the baby ? " he called , laughing as he pounded his chest in response to a similar greeting from Oka . Climbing back in his car , lie drove slowly past the Antelope House . The okapi , a cousin of the giraffe that looks more like a zebra and is rarely seen in zoos , was taking its morning constitutional in its outdoor enclosure . " We have two beautiful okapis , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mother beside a tree nearby : " First yak born here since 1942 . We call that a ' medium great event ' and we 're pleased . A great event is the acquisition of platypuses , the rarest creatures in captivity . " He stopped the car to look at the greater 47 kudu , a buff-colored African antelope with sweeping horns , standing motionless like a magnificent statue , its great head held high . " That kudu is a wonder , " he said , " but he 's been acting strange . Something disturbed him night before last , and he kicked down a pipe and chain . We got him on an exchange credit from the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago . Zoos exchange surplus animals as much as possible . This kndu would cost us about S1,500 , but we had a credit at the Brookfield Zoo and they had an extra kudu . " He peered at a nearby anoa , a pygmy buffalo , about the size of a St. Bernard dog , lying down in its enclosure . " 1 wonder what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he mused . " It does n't look right to me . " In another enclosure some friendly yellow dogs had run up to the fence , wagging their tails . " Dingo pups , " he said . " Australian wild dogs , and they are wild ! People often ask for the pups , to domesticate them , and we say no , of course . If these dogs are in the mood , they can rip a man apart . " Tee-Van pointed out that new animal food machines ? where a nickel in a slot produces a small cellophane bag full of grain nuggets ? had just been installed . " We put up the original machines in 1941 to keep people from feeding indigestibles to the animals . Worked out even better than we had thought . A mother told me that her three-year-old son fed more animal food to himself than to the animals , and 1 was able to assure her that it contained twenty-two ingredients , including wholesome vitamins and minerals , ? is the same food we feed our calves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANCIS TEE-VAN T H E car passed the African Plains , a four-acre enclosure inhabited by some forty animals whose only restraint is moats surrounding the area and separating them from each other . " The lions look good this morning , " he observed , " and so does the zebra . A bad zebra can be a very bad animal . " He stopped to light his pipe and gazed with obvious ' Pleasure at the bucolic scene of lions peacefully reclining in the grass near a grazing zebra , while a herd of aoudads , wild sheep with large curved horns and long manes , bounded past . " A wonderful place here , " he said . " Look at this mass of flowering trees . Beautiful ! " Dr. Tee-Van turned the car around , drove to the Reptile House , went in , and walked over The man who runs it started tending ostriches when he was a fourteen-year-old . . . he has pursued his dear beasts through jungles , desert islands , and ocean deeps .. ? and he now coddles all 2,631 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the alligators , displayed in a pool in a woodland setting that includes yellow and blue macaws on high perches set in rocky " banks . " " We 've lost two birds to those fellows , " he said , pointing to the crocodiles , slumbering with only the tops of their lethal jaws showing above water . " The last macaw came down from its perch and was gone like that . " He snapped his fingers . He pointed to a circular shallow pool filled with turtles of all sizes and surrounded by a low brass rail : " One problem is the number of small boys who pocket small turtles . We lose several every week . Some of the boys are turtle fanciers too and take only the best . " As he was leaving , he said , " I have just one more stop , the Elephant House . The boys are cleaning the walls with a steam jenny , and I want to see how the place looks . " The vaulted terra-cotta ceiling of the Elephant House had been scrubbed clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured through the high windows . Tee-Van walked over to two Indian elephants . " Notice the larger elephant 's feet , " he said . " That small chain from her right forefoot to her right hind foot is to prevent her from climbing up on the stone wall of her enclosure outside . Since the safety factor comes first in everything we do , when those stone fences were built we talked to absolutely everybody who knew anything about elephants , and we were told that a six-and-a-half foot fence would he high enough . Imagine how we felt when we saw this old girl place her forelegs over the wall , bringing her body around sideways , and put a hind leg over ! " Back in the car he passed the meadow-like flamingo enclosure . " That vegetation needs trimming , " he remarked . " One good thing we have here is plenty of grass , because we have plenty of space . When space is too limited , as it is in many zoos , the animals wear the grass down . " He drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start , parked his car in the circle by the main entrance , and 48 THE WONDERFUL zoo climbed a flight of steps to a grassy rectangular mall edged with tall elms and formal buildings . Called Baird Court , this is the inner core of the Zoo , with a sea-lion pool in its center . On the porch of the Administration Building , an imposing brick edifice , he stopped . " Right here one morning I saw a sparrow hawk swooping through the trees , " he told his visitor . " Jokingly , I put out my hand and said , ' Come on down , fellow , come down . ' To my astonishment , that bird did land right on my outstretched hand . One of the boys said I was St. Francis Tee-Van . I took it over to the Bird House , and it 's still there ! " He shook the ashes from his pipe and walked in , down a broad , carpeted hall , past a large comfortable living-room set aside for members of the Zoological Society , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large oil paintings of animals on the wails . Through the open windows the melodious bird-like sound of the female gibbon calling her mate could be heard , alternating with the heavier bark of the sea lions , an occasional tiger roar , and the raucous laugh of the kookaburra in the Bird House . A couch in one corner was piled with blueprints , topped by two world 's retord walrus tusks , and a long , low bookcase held various mementos ; a statue of a colt , a framed rendering of the name John Tee-Van in Chinese , and a blue dish from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute . which conferred an honorary Doctor of Science degree on the Director in 1955 , for his scholarly achievements as a zoologist . Dr. Tee-Van sat down at his desk , and immediately called the Zoo veterinarian , Dr , Charles Ganda . " Chick ? I wish you 'd look at the left hind leg of the anoa , " he said . " It seemed to me he was holding it strangely . " He put down the phone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebooks that contain the daily story of the Zoo and Aquarium . Both are operated by the New York Zoological Society , which is an independent organization , for the City of New York . The new Aquarium at Coney Island has its own Director , Christopher Coates , but Dr. Tee-Van 's position as General Director requires him to keep a watchful and responsible eye on the Aquarium as well as the Zoological Park . HOW IT ALL BEGAN T HE origins of the Bronx Zoo lie in the Boone and Crockett Club , founded in December 1887 by Theodore Roosevelt and other wealthy big-game enthusiasts . To qualify for membership , a man had to have killed " with the rifle . in fair chase , at least one adult male individual of each of three of the various species of American large game . " The Club 's purpose was to promote " manly sport with the rifle , " travel and exploradon in unknown lands , conservation of wild life , and scientific study of wild animals . The Club still meets , but emphasis now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park has always been an honorary member ( no shooting required ) . The idea for a zoological park in New York began among Boone and Crockett members late in 1894 , and on January 16 , 1895 , Theodore Roosevelt , the Club 's first president , appointed a committee of three formidable New YorkersElihu Root and Madison Grant , both lawyers , and C. Grant LaFarge , an architect ? to push the charter fur a zoological society through the New York State Legislature . The society was not only to manage the contemplated zoo , but to further zoological research and game conservation as well . The three men set out with their usual forcefulness , and only three months later , they had their Act of Incorporation written in the laws of New York State . Exhaustive studies were made both here and a broad to decide where and what kind of a zoological garden there should be . Two years later , on March 24 , 1897 , catne the Society 's Magna Carta ? a document entitled " Grant of South Bronx Park to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Society 261 acres of New York City . ( Over the years , ten acres have been lost to highways . ) It was agreed that the Society and city would each put up money for buildings , and the Society would manage the property . Today , with a $1.5 million budget , approximately $800,000 is contributed annually by the city For salaries of employees hired by the Society , and for care of the Park and animals . The partners still share in the construction of new buildings . The Zoological Park was opened to the public on November 8 , 1899 . More than a thousand animals were exhibited , and one hundred thousand visitors arrived during the first seven weeks . Today , the yearly attendance at the Zoo is between two and two-and-a-half million . Several principles established in the early days of the Zoo have had a lot to do with its present pre-eminence . The first was to operate in an ; Ituriosp here of money , and plenty of it . In the words of Henry Fairfield Osborn , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off when it was found necessary to contribute to the initial expenses of the Society and were replaced , one by one , by generous men whose civic pride and spirit were more than nominal . " Mr. Osborn 's son , Fairfield , the current president of the Society , has not forgotten his father 's ideas . His boards and committees include such names as Rockefeller , Frick , Schiff , Phipps , Vanderbilt , Baker , Gimbel , and Goelet . The second principle was to fill top administrative posts with the best men in the country , with emphasis on scientific achievements , and to give them " a large measure of encouragement and authority . " The first director was William T. Hornaclay , " explorer , naturalist , author , collector , and the first Director of the Zoological Park in Washington . " Instead of making animal keepers the heads of departments , he selected scientists to act as " curators " ? a system that has worked to the greater glory of the Zoo . Among the Bronx Zoo 's curators have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; William Beebe ? who at eighty belies his title of Director Emeritus of the Department of Tropical Research ( which he founded ) by running his research station at Trinidad and recently completing his fifty-ninth expedition ? and Lee S. Crandall , General Curator Emeritus , an expert on the care of animals and birds in zoos . " Not to be in the Zoological Society is not to be in society , " read a leading society journal in 1902 , The hard core of the Zoo 's financial support is still from the Social Register , but anyone with fifteen dollars can become an annual member ( $25,000 makes you a Benefactor , and there are ten of those ) . The yearly membership of the Society is 3,450 , and the relationship has an informal family quality about it . Along with asubscription to Animal Kingdom , a bi-monthly magazine , there are special Zoo or Aquarium parties for members , with performing animals , a five-piece band , refreshments , and special fish for children to feed the seals . Members also have free use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as animal rides , the Children 's Zoo , the Farm-in-the-Zoo ( an entire operating farm complete with cow-milking at 2:30 and 4:00 P.M. daily ) , and the Aquarium . A mother of three youngsters , who refers to the Bronx Zoo as her summer club , recently estimated , after three trips with her offspring that she had saved the price of membership in animal rides alone . ZOOLOGY WITHOUT TEARS N OT H I N G would surprise the thousands of people who throng through the Bronx Zoo on a sunny day , stopping to look at the parasol aunts or the new aardvark , more than to discover that a campaign is under way to teach them some zoological facts . " People come here to get recreation , " Dr. Tee-Van explains , " but I like to think they arc getting education when they read our labels . The exhibit must always he so interesting that people will want to read about it . We have a basic label ; the common name of the animal , then the scientific name , where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , and some detail that would interest the public . Since we abhor handwritten labels , ours are printed here , in our own shop . Labeling is one of the most important things we do here . " A lot more , in fact , goes on in the Zoo than the care of animals . Although the primary job of every Zoo employee is to maintain the animal collections and the grounds , the animals ' daily care is in the hands of the head keepers and their assistants . Several of the dozen members of the staff are engaged in research when administrative duties permit , often in collaboration with scientists in universities and museums . Over the past fifty years , considerable study has been done in the relationships between animals and their environments , classification of organisms , physiology , anatomy , pathology , genetics , parasitology , and , of course , animal behavior . Dr. Beebe 's Tropical Department is all research . Less widely known are pathologist Dr. Ross Nigrelli and geneticist Dr. Myron Gordon . Both have received outside grants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach zoology at New York University . Probably the least-known function of the Zoo is the exchange system worked out by its veterinarians with medical research people all over the country , who want parts of wild animals for comparative purposes . Last year tumors in dead animals were sent to the Brookhaven National Laboratory , monkey cadavers went to the Harvard Medical School 's Anatomy Department , any kind of hair was sent to the New York State Police Laboratory , adrenal glands went to New York University , and blood to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and Rutgers University 's Serological Museum . Cornell University received paratyphoid cultures and wolverine parts ; Columbia University , brains ; the Mayo Clinic , TB cultures ; Boston , eyes ; the University of California , hearts and blood vessels ; and the U. S. Department of Health 's Communicable Disease Center , fungi and ringworms . The Bronx Zoo has gradually built up one of the finest zoological libraries in the country ? a rarity for a zoological garden . It contains 7,000 volumes , many scattered through the curators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faraway spots as the Congo , Sarawak , Finland , and Indonesia . Research workers , students , reporters , and editors constantly call the Zoo for information . A special type of inquiry comes in around noontime from callers in bars who have placed bets . ( The most frequent bar-bet question : " How long does it take an elephant to have a baby ? " Answer : twenty to twenty-two months . ) No one takes more pride in the Bronx Zoo than that inspired nature-lover , Fairfield Osborn , the Society 's president . He calls the Zoo half a dozen times a day from the Society 's mid-Manhattan office , visits it every other Wednesday , and is interested in every detail of the operation : An irrepressible planner , he also devotes a good measure of his extraordinary energy and imagination to conservation . Besides sponsoring a biological research station at Jackson Hole , Wyoming , now in its eleventh year , he intendsto transform a portion of the wilderness still remaining in the Zoological Park 's Bronx land grant into a living conservation exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalist to scout territory in Alaska suitable for a permanent wild-life protection range . Once asked to explain the success of the Zoo and Society to an admirer , he answered , " By making everything everybody 's business and caring passionately . " In Dr. Tee-Van he has a person who thrives on that formula . He has a completely natural aptitude for complex administration , " Osborn has been heard to remark . THE DIRECTOR 'S DAY S OM E one person has to know everything that happens here , and I 'm that person , " Tee-Van explains . It is a sizable assignment but he is blessed with an easy-going disposition , gets along with people , and has the energy and ability to do two or three things at one time . Six feet tall and sixty-one years old , he has a long face , aquiline features , curly hair turning gray , and a warm and ready smile . " John would be a wonderful guy to go on a field trip with , " a colleague has said , " you could relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago on a Zoological Society expedition in the West Indies he once won a word game in which the trick was to see who could make up the longest sentence using only two letter words . His sentence : " If it is to be , it is up to me to do it . " One of the notebooks Dr. Tee-Van reads daily contains the report of the Zoo 's animal depart . ments : arrivals by birth , purchase , or gilt , and disposals by death , exchange , or sale . The Zoo keeps a card file of the complete life history of each animal . In a typical week , the Zoo received three gray squirrels from an upstate New York woman , five different varieties of deer were born , six spiny mice were sent to Swarthmore College , three birds were received as gifts , eight birds and an American gopher tortoise died , a coachwhip snake arrived from Florida , and two newts and two chuckwallas came from a dealer in Topeka , Kansas . Bequeathing pets to the Zoo is frowned upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had been accepted there would be little room for much else . But if native wild animals are brought in , the staff does its best to care for them , or sets them free . Grace Davall , the Assistant Curator of Mammals , is particularly soft-hearted about baby animals and keeps a supply of doll nursing bottles in her desk drawer for emergency feedings . Another notebook contains the weekly list of repairs to he made on the grounds : " Fluorescent fixture to be installed in Ostrich House " ; " Repairs to cement in moat , Great Apes , Orangoutang " ; " Check hydraulic door in rhino stall " ; " Llama watering trough leaks " ; " Replace new plank on Rainbow Bridge at African Plains . " Usually before he has finished reading this Dr. Tee-Van calls in Charlie Driscoll , the Superintendent of Construction and Maintenance , for a chat . Then he may go over the Zoo 's financial statements : souvenirs , tractor trains , the Children 's Zoo , the animal food machines , commissaries , and publications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss because of its elaborate layout . Dr. Tee-Van , like everyone else at the Zoo , is particularly interested in new Zoological Society members . The Membership Secretary , Gordon Cuyler , who is also his administrative assistant , gives him a list of new members ' names , addresses , who suggested membership , and transfers from annual to contributing ( 525 ) or life ( $300 ) membership . Next may come the consideration of a $100 loan without interest to an employee from the $3,000 Loan Fund . This may be followed by the report on rat extermination . Rats are a chronic ailment of all zoos because of the animals ' food , and certain employees at the Bronx Zoo have the right to shoot any rats on sight after hours , except near special buildings . Rat squad members get twenty-five cents a rat and dispose of some 180 a month . Almost every day Dr. Tee-Van talks with Herb Knobloch , Assistant Curator of Education , about his complex calendar of activities . These include guided tours for school classes through the Zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zoo ; an outgoing lecture service with live animals for demonstration in the city schools ; the operation of the Question House , a small building where a trained zoologist is stationed to answer questions ( including such brain ticklers as " Do snakes laugh ? " and " How much would all the animals here put together weigh ? " ) ; andthe collection and use of animal films , photographs , slides , and publications in co-operation with the Curator of Publications , William Bridges . Knobloch 's visit is usually followed or interrupted by other staff members , all of whom drop in on the Director with some problem or other during the day . In between , Dr. ' Fee-Van may puzzle over plans for the remodeled bear dens , or talk to Christopher Coates at the Aquarium , or to the Zoo hospital about a sick animal . Unless he has a special lunch with an important visitor in the Members ' Room , he eats his cream cheese and jelly sandwich , apple pie , and coffee on the Flamingo Terrace , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far cry from one previous director , who ate every day in solitary splendor across the room from the staff . lie may spend the afternoon preparing for the regular Wednesday Operating Committee meeting , or for the monthly Executive Committee meeting . Or he may look over the next issue of Zoologien. , a scientific journal of research papers published quarterly by the Society . Or he may talk with Bridges about a new publication he has in mind . Zoo , officials often come in from other cities or countries who want to start a zoological society of their own , or improve their zoo . The plans for the Bronx Zoo 's Great Apes House and Reptile House have been sent all over North America , Europe , and Africa ; and the Frankfurt Zoo has built a larger version of the Penguin House . No two of Tee-Van 's working days are the same . Some of his predecessors saw their staff only by special appointment , but Dr. Tee-Van 's office door is always open . A great many people , including strangers , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BATHYSPHERE 0 N E of the first things most people ask about Dr. Tee-Van is whether he is Chinese or Dutch . He is neither . To the best of his knowledge , two or three brothers named de Vannes came from Brittany to Ireland three hundred years ago , and his own father , Patrick Tee-Van , left Ireland and came to the United States around 1870 . He was a construction man for the Bronx Zoological Park and worked on the buildings even before the Zoo was opened . John was born in Brooklyn on July 6 , 1897 . His mother died when he was four , and the boy was sent to stay for a few weeks with one of her former schoolmates in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn . The few weeks lasted ten years . Oddly enough , in view of his subsequent career , Dr. ' Tee-Van 's only clear recollection of his mother was when he was frightened by a St. Bernard dog at the age of four . " I was playing in the back yard , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . It scared the daylights out of me and I called my mother , who came and picked me up . " In 1911 , when he was fourteen , Tee-Van left his foster home and went to live with his father in the Bronx . He quit school , got his working papers , presented himself at the Bronx Zoo , and asked Director Hornaday for a job . Hornaday sent him around to Lee Crandall , then Curator of Birds , Crandall hired him and put him in the Large Bird House at thirty dollars a month , and he was shortly made assistant keeper of the ostriches . " We would n't take anyone that age now , " Dr. ' bee-Van mused recently . " A lad must be at least eighteen to work in the animal departments , and a keeper now gets from $3,500 to $4,580 a year . I went to high school at night , and started to study architectural draftsmanship . I spent three years at it , and 1 remember winning a couple of prizes . For another four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and math . " Lee Crandall remembers Tee-Van as a " long skinny kid , very studious , hard-working , and methodical . It 's indicative of his character , " headds , " that he was the first keeper who ever kept a card record of the birds in his care . " ( The card file of fishes started by Tee-Van when he shifted to Dr. Beebe 's department became the basis of a definitive encyclopedia of Fishes of the Western North Atlantic he has edited for the Sears Foundation of Yale University . ) The turning point in Tee-Van 's life came when he met Dr. William Beebe who had come to the Zoo when it opened as the first Curator of Birds . A brilliantly inventive and restless scientist , who disliked the routine of a Curator 's job , Beebe soon began to spend part of each year on expeditions . Beebe became interested in John Tee-Van when he saw some drawings that the nineteenyear-old had done of an aviary to be built on the Cleveland , Ohio , estate of a wealthy big-game hunter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor penguin in his trophy room and introduced the first pair of love birds into the United States , had asked Crandall to design the aviary . Crandall did so , and asked Tee-Van , who had begun making zoological drawings , to make sketches of the design . The aviary was never built , but Beebe , returning from an expedition to British Guiana and needing some drawings for a book he was preparing , saw the sketches and sought out the artist . " I did the drawings for his book , Tropical Wild Life in British Guiana . " Dr. Tee-Van recollects , " and when Will Beebe went back to British Guiana in 1917 to salvage materials he had left there , I went with him . I was twenty , it was my first touch of the tropics , and my first job was to move all his material across a river to headquarters in His Majesty 's Penal Settlement . We were at Kartabo , in British Guiana , for from six to eleven months for five years . I first worked on butterflies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably because no one else was working on fishes . " Like his chief , old Dr. Hornaday , Beebe was a strict taskmaster , and Tee-Van got a first-class training from him . Beebe on his part was struck by the young man 's scientific ability , mechanical ability , and liking for people . " I ca n't drive a nail , and when any kind of machine breaks , I sit down and howl for help , " Dr. Beebe remarked recently . " But John 's eyes glisten and he just tackles it like a doctor , and makes it well again . " In 1922 Tee-Van met his future wife , Helen Damrosch , a well-known illustrator of zoological and children 's hooks , in New York , just before she was to join the Tropical Research Department in British Guiana as a zoological artist . The next summer they were married at Seal Harbor , Maine . Mrs. Tee-Van has vivid memories of life in British Guiana ; " We had one building with a big veranda , and we ate and worked on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bamboo trees and we worked whenever there was something to be clone , until all hours . In the evenings sometimes we would sit on the floor while Will read aloud , usually poetry , and we played a lot of word games . " Mrs. Tee-Van went with her husband on many of Beebe 's expeditions , including one to Haiti , when they lived for six months on a four-masted schooner , sleeping on the deck in tents . Tee-Van accompanied Beebe on twenty-three expeditions in all , including one to Panama and the Galapagos Islands on board Vincent Astor 's yacht Noma in 1923 , which had been chartered for them by Harrison Williams , a wealthy Zoological Society trustee . This was the first time diving helmets were used ? Beebe 's famous Bathysphere did n't materialize until seven years later ? and Tee-Van designed an underwater camera , or rather a small box into which a camera was fitted , so that a diver could use it under water . Two years later , Harrison Williams chartered a big steamer , the Arcturus , and Beebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time did oceanographic work . This expedition sailed through the Sargasso Sea and the Caribbean via the Panama Canal to the Galapagos Islands . IV/1ile managing these expeditions , which required keeping intricate accounting books for Williams , Tee-Van did a large amount of basic research . His most spectacular achievement was a series of photographs of a transparent deep-sea eel egg , one of the earliest known photographic records of the actual embryonic development of an egg . Ten thousand frames of continuous motion picture were made of the egg , which Tee-Van held in focus for four days and nights . He rigged up a device beside his bed with the egg propped up in the end of a medicine dropper , and kept himself half-awake with a red light that went off once a minute , Tee-Van has received no honor that pleased him more ? aside from his honorary degree ? than the invitation from Dr. Beebe , when the department was at Nonsuch Island , Bermuda , in 1934 , to accompany him on his thirty-fifth dive in the Bathysphere . ( This original Bathysphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zoo . ) Until then , Tee-Van had always supervised deck activities for the Bathysphere 's underwater operaLions . " We had been working with the Bathysphere for so long , watching and thinking of every bolt and wire and gasket , " he wrote later , " that I was delighted to think that at last I would see it working from below . . . . We were a detached part of the world , sealed tight inside our metal ball , with no possible chance of opening the door ... we became , like the Bathysphere itself , two huge eyes looking out upon a world that had existed with little change for countless centuries . ... " JOURNEY WITH PANDAS D URING the twenty-five years Tee-Van was with Beebe , he spent from two to nine months every year in the Tropical Research Department 's laboratory at the Bronx Zoo . A low rectangular building hidden behind the Eagle Aviary , the laboratory can be reached by going past a row of garbage cans and through a narrow passage behind the Flamingo Terrace . The members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at desks and tables presided over by Beebe himself , a tall , thin , Spartan figure , who sits at an ancient rolltop desk surrounded by books , microscopes , and thousands of bottles filled with frogs , snakes , shellfish , and other fauna , pickled in formaldehyde . Many of these bottles are moved to permanent collections in museums when the staff has finished studying them , but there are dozens of cabinets and cases filled with butterflies , moths , beetles , shells , fish , and birds ' eggs ; all carefully marked and each there for a certain purpose . Every now and then , Dr. Tee-Van comes back and pats his old desk , a large pigeonhole affair , with a piano stool instead of a chair , catty-corner to Dr. Beebe ; and Tee-Van frequently drags a book out of the laboratory in the middle of lunch to prove a point in the spirrted discussions that occur during the daily staff lunch-hour . Tee-Van 's shift to Zoo administration was gradual , for Beebe was reluctant to let him go . In 1939 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Society , at the New York World 's Fair . The exhibit was a smashing success , and in June 1940 , when Osborn became the Society 's president , he went to Beebe and said , " Will , I want fohnl " He got . him , and the following year sent him on a 34,851-mile trip via New Zealand , Australia , the Dutch East Indies , Singapore , Rangoon , and the Burma Road to China , where he picked up a pair of black and white giant pandas , a gift from Madame Chiang Kai-shek to the Bronx Zoo , in gratitude for American relief work in China . Tee-Van left New York on September 24 , 1941 , and arrived in Chengtu , West China , on October 30 , having traveled by plane , boat , train , car , and , inevitably , ricksha . " Two pandas are worse than a primary school , " he wrote in his daily journal a week alter they had been handed over to him . He was in constant attendance ott his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hQ delivered them to the Bronx Zoo . His entire existence on the trip from China to the United States was wrapped up in obtaining the right kind of bamboo shoots , keeping them fresh , and ensuring sufficient new supplies to provide the constant munching essential to giant panda contentment ( each panda consumed about twenty pounds a clay ) ; getting the animals shipped down mountains , across land , rivers , and oceans , through temperatures that ranged from freezing to equatorial ; and guarding them from such constant dangers as crowds , photographers . and the painting routine of a ship where a drop of paint taken internally would be certain death . Overfeeding or underfeeding were additional worries , and finally , on December 8 , when the three of them were on the SS President Coolidge in a convoy , came the news of Pearl Harbor and the declaration of war . " No life preservers provided for the pandas , " Tee-Van wrote on Christmas Eve , " but most passengers seem to feel that something could he done for them if the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain 's heart could be approached . " One of his worst experiences was crossing the New Jersey flats in a baggage car on the final lap of the journey , ten minutes before their train was due in New York . He had let the pandas out of their cages to exercise an hour before , and the wilder one refused to return to its quarters . He wrote in his last journal entry : " Before was successful in placing him behind the barred doors of his cage my hands were ... lacerated and I finished up dirty , disheveled , and tremblingly exhausted . " Shortly after his return from China in 1942 , Tee-Van was made Executive Secretary of the Zoological Park . In 1932 he was named Director of the Park and Aquarium , and in 1956 received the special new title of General Director . The Tee-Vans , who have no children , live in a pleasant apartment in Manhattan with a collection of Chinese snuff bottles and a black Scotty dog named Kilpurdy . The only time Tee-Van ever brought a live animal home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the apartment and said , " Guess what I have in my overcoat pocket ? " As Mrs. Tee-Van tells the story , " Just to be silly , 1 said , ' Oh , I suppose a baby hoa constrictor , ' and that 's just what it was ! " Neither Tee-Van nor his associates at the Zoo are troubled by the idea of keeping wild animals in captivity .

But such major structural changes are expensive . Meanwhile , they content themselves with the assurance that since mostof their animals , especially the larger ones , come to them as babies or alter they are adjusted to captivity , zoo life is what these animals know and understand . In fact , the administration will confide that it believes the animals in the Bronx Zoo lead a pampered existence , with no housing , heating , food , or health problems that ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal in the Zoo , we have an obligation to give it the proper attention , " Dr. Tee-Van said recently to a visitor in his office at five o'clock in the afternoon , as he was preparing to leave for the day . " It takes only a few basic animals almost any place to make up a pretty good zoo ? monkeys , elephants , lions , zebras , and giraffes . But when you expand and bring in as many animal species as we do , especially the rare ones , then you have a great zoo . " He picked up his brief case and walked out , stopping for a moment on the steps of the Administration Building . " What we have here is a living museum . " He paused to listen to the musical call of the gibbon . " What lovely creatures we have , " he said . " Are n't they marvelous : "
