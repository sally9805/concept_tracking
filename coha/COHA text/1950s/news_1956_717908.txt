The priests sang according to the ancient ritual , but while they chanted waiters from a Katmandu hotel strolled around the courtyard offering soft drinks . A scarlet-coated band played Nepalese and Indian music , and a group of yellow-hatted pipers competed unconcernedly . Every now and then piper would stroll over to a bandsman for a chat or a musician would jump down from a stone stand for a drink of water at a courtyard tap .
