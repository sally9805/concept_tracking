txt President Eisenhower called to ? day for " moderation " on the issue of school segregation , " but with La1 determination to make progress . " The President indicated at his news conference a gentle but unmistakably affirmative approach to the problem of compliance with the Supreme Court decision . He said that decision , which declared segregation in the public schools was unconstitutional , should be applied in the South gradually , with understanding , without coercion  --  but it must be applied . " We must be patient without being complacent , " he said . The President said a bipartisan civil rights commission , which he had asked Congress to create , should study the record of compliance with the decisien . This was a significant expansion in the proposed commission 's purpose . The President previously had said that the group would investigate charges that Negroes had been denied the right to vote and had been subjected to economic pressures . President Set for Questions President Eisenhower , in good spirits and in firm voice , made these comments on other major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to be on any political ticket " with Vice President Richard M.

ITSpeed is essential on a new farm bill if it is to take effect before the planting season . The President clearly was prepared for questions on the racial issue . His words represented an answer to recent demands , largely from the Democrats , that he exert his leaderslep tee calm racial troubles in the South . What he said expressed in more detail and with more force the philosphy he often had indicated before  --  sympathy for the South 's problems , but no retreat from the principle of the Supreme Court decision . When the segregation matter was brought up , by the third questioner of the conference , the President seemed almost eager to give his views . His voice rose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length . The question referred to the manifesto filed by 100 Senators and Representatives from the South this week calling the Supreme Court decision " unwarContinue " on , Page 16 , Column 5 EISENHOWER ASKS FOR ' MODERATION ' // ranted " and . pledging resistance by " all lawful means . " The President was asked to comment , especially as to what he thought the Executive responsibility was and should be . " The first thing about the manifesto , " the President said , " is this : That they say they are going to use every legal means . " No one in any responsible position anywhere has talked nullification * * * , There would be a place where we get to a very bad spot for the simple reason I am sworn to defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States and , of course , I can never abandon or refuse to carry out my duty .

" General Eisenhower apparently referred only to nullification talk in Congress . Turning away from the manifesto itself , the President asserted in effect that if extreme views such as nullification or immediate coercion of the South could be put aside the racial problem could be solved . " Let us remember that the Supreme Court itself talked about emotionalism in this question , " he said , " and it was for that reason that it said : ' Progress must be gradual . ' * * * " If ever there was a time when we must be patient without being complacent , when we must be understanding of other people 's deep emotions as well as our own , this is it . Extremists on neither side are going to help this situation , and we can only believe that the good sense , the common sense , of Americans will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the North to note two other factors . First , he said , there has been some progress toward racial integration in the public schools of the South . He said more than 250,000 Negro children now were attending integrated schools in border states and in the South outside of " a certain area in which the difficulties are greatest . " Second , the President said , it should be remembered that the South had not been acting " in defiance of law " over the last three generations but had followed the now-discarded Supreme Court ruling of 1894 that " separate but equal " schools were constitutional . ' Not Talking About Coercion ' " I do n't know anything about the length of time it will take , " he concluded . " We are not talking here about coercing , using force * * * . We are simply going to uphold the Constitution of the United States , see that the progress made as ordered by ( the Supreme Court ) be carried out * * * . " I have never yet given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great problem like this , will approach it intelligently and with patience and with understanding and we will get somewhere . " The President brought up his bipartisan commission proposal when he was asked his opinion of suggestions by Adlai E. Stevenson and other Democrats that he call white and Negro , leaders of the South together to discuss ways of easing racial tension . The idea of calling in a group , and letting everyone air his views would be one thing to do , President Eisenhower said , but it was not what he wanted . He said he preferred a commission authorized by Congress " because then they can subpoena witnesses and bring people in and compel them to testify . " The President then added his unexpected reference to the Supreme Court school case . " This decision was made , as I recall , in 1954 , " he said , " and we are getting along now to where ' some real investigative body ought to be watching it and looking at it all the time . I would like to have that body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , and as quickly as possible . " The commission idea was first mentioned in the President 's State of the Union Message in January . He said then that such a group should be formed to investigate charges that in some areas " Negro citizens are being deprived of their right to vote and are likewise being subjected to unwarranted economic pressures . " Reaction to the proposal in January was unfavorable on both sides . Southerners in Congress called it interference , and groups favoring civjj rights legislation said it was meaningless . Congress has taken lip action on the idea , but it is understood to be a part of a new civil rights message that the Justice Department may send to Congress next week . There was no immediate response today from the pro-civil rights group to the President 's greatly broadened commission idea . But Senator Richard L. Neuberger , Democrat of Oregon , Said the President himself could set up any such commission " whenever he wants to " without Congressional approval . He said President Eisenhower and his predecessors had established many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other points today in the area of racial segregation : ClHe said that if Southern Senators attempted to block confirmation of judges who opposed their segregation views , he would publicly urge confirmation but could do nothing more . 9He rejected a proposal that he promise to withhold any Federal school aid voted by Congress from districts not in compliance with the Supreme Court decision . Some members of Congress have suggested such a pledge from the President as a way to kill a pending anti-segregation amendment to the school aid bill . The amendment , introduced by Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr. , Manhattan . Dem .. Democrat , is blocking action on the school measure . Late today Americans for Democratic Action issued a statement highly critical of the President 's record on the race relations issue . The group said that " inaction " by him " has allowed civil disorder in parts of the South to approach a level * * unknown in America since the Civil War . " The A. D.
