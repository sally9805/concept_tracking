Since he was publicly censured last December , the junior Senator from Wisconsin has been a virtual stranger on Capitol Hill . He hardly ever turns up at committee meetings , and his appearances in the Senate chamber are rare indeed . Last week the vibrant voice of Joe McCarthy was heard once more , in a blistering attack on President Eisenhower and the forthcoming Big Four meeting . <P> " The Administration , " cried Joe , " is fashioning the free world 's worst defeat since the end of World War II . " The President and his advisers were now determined that the U.S. would " play the role of straight man to the Soviet Union . " Such " creeping madness " has created " a mental atmosphere every bit as lethal to the free world 's cause as an atomic fallout . " <P> Senate Minority Leader William Knowland , in the past a staunch supporter of McCarthy and a frequent foe of Eisenhower 's foreign policy , was visibly agitated by the speech . When McCarthy sat down . Bill Knowland stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass , " he announced , " and . . . appear to give the impression that I subscribe to McCarthy 's point of view . . . We are not bankrupt in our negotiating power . . . The President will do everything possible to protect the vital interests of the country and of the free world at the Geneva Conference . " Then he urged united support of the President and of the Geneva meeting . <P> When Knowland had finished , McCarthy was disgruntled but unchastened . " I think , Bill , " he said sadly , " you will regret some of the things you said here today . " <P> What the McCarthy exchange amounted to was another important step in the decline and political isolation of Joe McCarthy .
