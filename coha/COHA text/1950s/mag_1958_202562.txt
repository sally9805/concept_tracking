Girding itself in nuclear armor , the U.S. has devised such costly weapons as supersonic aircraft , attack and defense missiles , continent-wide radar-warning screens and atomic submarines . But it lags in a weapon that the Rockefeller Report last January warned would become " an increasingly important deterrent , " i.e. , fallout shelters in which the U.S. populace could wait out nuclear attacks . Last week the Administration took a halting step toward improving that deterrent . Appearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee , Defense and Civilian Mobilization Director Leo Hoegh outlined his program for public education on radiation , asked a modest $13,150,000 to get a prototype shelter program going . <P> Of the funds sought , $1,850,000 would be used to survey existing buildings , tunnels , subways , mines and cyclone cellars . Reason : Nevada and Eniwetok Atoll tests have shown that radiation can be cut to one-five-thousandth of its outside intensity by 3 ft. of soil , 2 ft. of concrete or 2 inches of steel .

He would also pick an underground garage , school or hospital under construction in each state , put up the extra cost of adding shelter facilities , then urge local governments and industry to emulate the example .
