Many a state in the Union wanted to land the big new plant . It would cost $25 million to $35 million , employ 1,500 , be the first in the U.S. to produce a Dacron-like fiber called Teron . This week the site was announced by its joint builders-Britain 's Imperial Chemical Industries and the Celanese Corp . of America . Their choice was Shelby , N.C. One major reason for choosing North Carolina , said Celanese , was the " wholehearted cooperation " of Governor Luther Hartwell Hodges . <P> Energetic , engaging Luther Hodges , 60 , ranks as the South 's No. i salesman . He is constantly traveling ( 63,000 miles last year ) and speechifying ( 150 last year ) to extol North Carolina 's attractions for industry . Among them , as listed by Celanese : " An adequate supply of skilled and semiskilled personnel , attractive residential areas , an excellent public school system , a good network of state and county highways . " The state also has a right-to-work law and the lowest rate of unionization in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are organized ) . Since Hodges became Governor in 1954 , industrial investments in North Carolina have almost doubled , this year will top $225 million ; , <P> Business in Politics . Ex-Businessman Luther Hodges is a businessman 's Governor who likes to say : " I 'm one of the few Governors who did n't have any training in politics-except for my general understanding of public relations . " <P> The eighth of nine children of a poor tenant tobacco farmer , Hodges started working as a twelve-year-old hand in Marshall Field &; Co. ' s Fieldcrest mill at Spray , N.C. , worked his way through the University of North Carolina ( ' 19 ) , then went back to the Spray mill . He rose rapidly , became vice president of Marshall Field in 1943 , and in 1950 he retired , at 52 , to devote the rest of his life to public service . He served a year as industrial chief of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration in Germany . In 1952 , unwanted and unsupported by the state 's Democratic organization , Hodges ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glad-handed so many voters that he won handily . Two years later Hodges moved up to Governor when Governor William Umstead died , and in 1956 he was easily reelected . <P> Problems in Manufacturing . Few businessmen would want the kind of headaches that Hodges inherited as Governor . Though rich in scenery and resources , North Carolina is basically a maze of stamp-sized , undermechanized , undercapitalized farms . Its top crop is tobacco ( more than half the U.S. output ) , which exhausts the soil , brings small profits to the farmer . North Carolina 's manufacturing is largely in textiles , a low-wage , boom-or-bust industry . Among the states , North Carolina stood No. i in the number of farm residents ( 1.4 million ) , No. 48 in the average weekly earnings of manufacturing workers ( $47.88 ) . It was clear to Hodges what North Carolina needed . " We had to get our farmers to diversify , to go into other businesses . But where were they to get the capital ? "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
