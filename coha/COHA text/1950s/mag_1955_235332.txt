FRANCE 'S famed Eugene Delacroix ( 1798-1863 ) once told an art student : " If you are not skillful enough to sketch a man jumping out of a window in the time it takes him to fall from the fourth story to the ground , you will never be able to produce great works . " Delacroix 's aim , as his friend French Poet Charles Baudelaire put it more precisely , was " to execute quickly enough and with sufficient sureness so as not to allow any element in the intensity of an act or idea to be lost . " To this end Delacroix worked continually to perfect his drawing , at his death left behind him no less than 11,000 pastels , watercolors and sketches . A selection of these , on view this week at Harvard 's Fogg Art Museum ( see opposite ) , shows how much this wealth of preparation contributed to the magic of the paintings that have made his name . <P> Paradoxically , while he sketched rapidly , Delacroix spent eight months in preliminary studies for a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he approached painting itself as a great performer approaches music ; he believed that only endless practice prepares the artist for the grand performance when he must soar above pedestrian problems of technique . He was in continual revolt against the neoclassic manner that Ingres had inherited from Napoleon 's court painter . David . To find a counterbalance , Delacroix went back to Rubens ' tumultuous , baroque style . A cold , diffident man in private life , he drew his inspiration from music , or from the grand gestures of English Actor Edmund Kean 's playing of Shakespearean tragedies or the literary works ( Goethe , Sir Walter Scott , Byron and Tas-so ) , noting in his journal , " Remember eternally certain passages from Byron to inflame your imagination . " <P> Though in his day Delacroix won even Goethe 's praise for his Faust drawings , much of his theatrical subject matter-triumphant crusaders , fierce sultans and pashas , sultry harem girls-today seems mawkish . Probably only his scenes drawn on the barricades during the 1830 revolution still hold men 's imagination . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . He attacked his craft with an iron will , raising color to a central , expressive role and making discoveries in form and line that still delight the eye .
