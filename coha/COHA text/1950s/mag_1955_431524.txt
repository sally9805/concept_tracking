Their nation is made up of 79 million persons speaking some two-score languages and clustered on 3,000 islands sprawled across the Equator . Superimposed on the United States , Indonesia would reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific .

This courtesy and this leisureliness are all the more notable when one tries to square them with an uncomfortable fact : Indonesia 's monetary standard of living still hovers in the neighborhood of $50 per capita per year . Perhaps one answer is that in Indonesia 's gentle climate such a little goes such a long way . With neither cold nor constant gales to battle , a palm-thatched hut provides reasonable shelter . A sarong and a couple of shirts form a wardrobe . The price of rice is pegged at a tolerable sum , and any small plot will produce bananas , cassava , coconuts , breadfruit , and the like .

City Battles Mosquito Menace Our trip began in Djakarta , which many westerners still know as Batavia ( page 358 ) . When Dutch adventurers plunged ashore here in 1619 and founded a trading post , the town touched the Java Sea . Now , with the silting of the rivers , more than a mile of mud flats and fish ponds separate its old red-tiled roofs from the ocean ; the new city , chief entry port to Indonesia for air-borne visitors , has spread some 10 miles inland to higher , and somewhat healthier , ground . As late as 1793 , the editor of Lord Macartney 's Journal of the Embassy to China wrote : " Half the Europeans of all classes who go and settle in Batavia are thought to die before the year is out . Hence , Batavia is like a battlefield or besieged town .

If Djakarta remains a battleground , it is chiefly between its 30,000 pedicabs , called bet jaks , and their chosen quarry , the pedestrian . Propelled by sheer leg-power , adorned with plumes , humming as the wind strikes the rubber bands stretched beneath their seats . and feverishly sounding their bells , the betjak hordes bear down upon street crossers like the chariots of the Assyrians . Everything Comes to the Front Door For all that , and despite its monstrous growth to a metropolis of more than 2% million , Djakarta retains a distinctly rural air . With few high buildings and innumerable avenues of tree-shaded bungalows , it seems a coagulation of crowded kampongs , or villages . Even down in the sultry business district the swallows fly in and out of the staid banking houses , over the bent heads of the clerks . Barefoot boys shuffle from desk to desk at a plantation pace , bearing trays of tea . There are shops in Djakarta , plenty of them , but one does n't have to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Sitting under a tree outside my room at the Hotel Transaera , an itinerant cobbler resoled my shoes for a few rupiahs . The mushrooming of the city has , naturally left it grievously short of housing , as the traveler with no definite hotel reservations will realize as he spends the night on a billiard table or in some broom closet .

Originally built , too , around an old trading port , it has spilled over its barriers and spread upriver along the Mas in a maze of redroofed houses .

I remember , too , a conversation later with a local resident as we sat beside Kupang 's pair of cracked concrete tennis courts . " Do you like the hunting . sir ? " he asked politely . " Well , no , not much . Do you ? " " Oh , yes ! " " What do you hunt ? " " Cows . " " Cows ! You mean you shoot them ? " But of course I shoot them . " It turned out that he meant wild waterbuffalo cows . The next day , as we drove some 60 miles into the interior toward Bokong , I passed other men after the same game .

But the Timorese are clearly a hardy bunch . We saw men toting poles hung with raw meat , others driving herds of domesticated carabaos to market , still others plowing in gangs of 10 , each man armed with a stick to turn over the soil . Up in the hills behind us lived even more primitive types , who wear no clothes at all . sleep under trees , and subsist on a few ears of corn , grubs . and roots . The government now is encouraging some of these isolated mountaineers to come down and live in more compact settlements where they can learn a diversified but simple agriculture . The west monsoon was exploding jets of spray over the sea wall when our plane took off from Kupang for Makassar , and the few sailing praus offshore heeled over on their  | utriggers , scudding for the harbor .

Bandits Raid Makassar Road In Celebes , which the Republic has renamed Sulawesi , we became uneasily aware for the first time of Indonesia 's security problem . The road to the right of the Makassar airport was unsafe after some six miles ; bandits and rebels fighting for " home rule " raided it all too frequently . We took the road to the left , naturally , but even on it we ran into three military check points before we reached the city . " What do you think they want from us ? " asked Joe when we drew up at the first barrier . " Probably just want to find out if we 're pro-Makassar or antimacassar ! " A week or two later dissidents in this area burned more than 6,000 houses in three days of terrorism . And the next month a Garuda planeload of passengers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had taken , were kidnaped . In Makassar we drove by the reassuring bulk of old Fort Rotterdam , a fine star-shaped structure with arrowhead bastions and , peeping over its sloping stone walls , a cluster of three-story , steep-gabled Dutch houses . Along the harbor front flanking the rattan market ? Indonesia 's largest ? we found schooners drawn up , gunwale to gunwale , fit reminders of the maritime skill of the Celebes people . Before the first Dutch or Portuguese caravels bobbed into these waters , Makassar 's great praus were sailing along the Cathay coast to Formosa and west to Madagascar , navigating by the stars with astounding precision . Blunt-bowed , flush-decked , with a high poop and two long blades lashed to either side of the stern as rudders , the prau is a remarkably able boat .

Coffee , copra. desiccated coconut , and a marked ability at trading earn them a good living . A new $43,000,000 harbor at Bitung with a deepsea entrance from both north and south , then about half finished , should give their economy a further shot in the arm . With no direct air route to carry us on from Celebes , we slanted back southwest to Surabaja again and then north over to Bandjarmasin , on the south coast of Borneo ( see supplement map ) .

Busy Boulevard of Water Traffic Life in Borneo , indeed , is largely river life . Men live on the river , travel on it , bathe in it , die on its banks ( page 384 ) .

Tiny lamps flickered from the stalls and shops on either bank , and fires glowed on the little praus themselves ? floating miniature restaurants they were , with a woman in the stern alternately paddling and tending her skillet . In the velvet hush of evening the whole town strolled , softly gossiping , laughing , and drinking in the smells of roasting goat meat . fiery sate sauce , clove-scented cigarettes , millet cakes , and bananas frying in iron bowls of coconut oil .

Western Technology on Borneo Oil Fields Martapura means ' Gate to the Diamonds " ? found in many of the island 's stream beds and panned like gold . But Borneo 's 290,000 square miles contain , as well , a good deal of rubber , coal , pepper , and ? most important of all ? petroleum . In the Indonesian part the oil fields occur around Balikpapan , Sangasanga , and on the island of Tarakan , and are operated by the Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij better known as BPM , a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell .

Jai " Monkeys Whoop over Jungle Camp In Sumatra , across the Java Sea from Borneo , we saw an American firm tackling the problem of building something out of nothing . Caltex began explorations on a large scale near Pakanbaru in 1935 ; it found oil four years later , but had to let the Japanese actually bring in the first producing well during the island 's occupation . The first teams came back to Pakanbaru in 1949 and found ? but let the wife of the operations manager tell how she saw it when she joined her husband a few months later .

One is roads . In this tropical country , a few score miles from the Equator , Caltex 's trucks use snow-tread tires and chains ! " You see , we have n't any gravel , any solid subsoil to build our roads on , " the manager of administration and services at Rumbai Camp told me . " We just pound the earth down and impregnate it with oil . When it rains a little , the surface is slick as a hog 's back . When it rains hard , we have to rebuild ' em ? on the average , about every six weeks ! " Another problem is animals ? elephants , pythons , tigers .

They counted noses . One short . Rushing back into a tent on the edge of their bivouac , they found the missing member being crushed on his cot in the coils of a 25-foot python .

Perhaps the oddest aspect of the story was its conclusion ; the man on the cot went calmly back to sleep that same night ! Pakanbaru , though , has some tales of its own .

A crone chewing a plug of serih , a mixture of nuts , leaves , and lime , opened a sort of loophole under the eaves , and I could discern an open hearth with a cat dozing in the ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some snapshots tacked to the wall . I looked at them closely , and the woman pointed at herself and said proudly , " Anakanak . Children . Mine . " Possibly , I thought , things are changing a little more than first meets the eye . For the pictures showed a girl and boy in Western dress seated in a snappy , chrome-resplendent , late-model convertible ! From Medan we flew to Padang on Sumatra 's west coast , with the pilot obligingly dropping down over Lake Toba to give us another view of Prapat , the resort in which we had passed a pleasant day and night . Scenically , Toba can stand up to Lake Maggiore or any of Europe 's noted watering places . Its great 1,700-foot-deep lake covers more than 685 square miles and has an island in it of almost 250 square miles . Red-roofed cottages and resthouses are set down along the shore amid a profusion of poinsettias . crepe myrtle , and bougainvillea ( page 386 ) . Fishermen skim about in slender praus. angling for the big golden carp which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . Middle Class Emerging in Padang Padang , capital of the Minangkabaus , gave us an immediate impression of vigor and high morale . This Islamic people has equipped Indonesia with some of its sturdiest and most progressive leaders ? men like the late Hadji Agus Salim ( The Grand Old Man of Indonesia ) , Vice President Mohammed Hatta ( page 358 ) , and Soetan Sjahrir . Their region is one of the few in which a native middle class seems to be emerging , confident of its capacity to compete with the ubiquitous Chinese . With none of the usual torpor which envelops Indonesia 's smaller airports , Minangkabau merchants assailed us as soon as we got off the plane with offers of old krises spears , snakeskins , and tiger pelts complete with toothy , grinning skulls . On the streets we missed for the first time the bell-clanging . Chinese-owned betjak ; instead , bendis jogged along , pulled by tiny pomponed horses considerably outweighed by their passengers .

Some 3.000 feet high , this town is situated among some of the handsomest valleys of the archipelago ? and some of the wettest . We had a rare break in seeing the sun several times in our three days there ; rare , for Mount Singgalano a few miles away has hung up an indicative record : it gets 320 days of rain a year , with a mean relative humidity of 93 percent ! Despite this damp reception , Bukittingi has other things to offer a visitor . Among them are its richly carved , saddle-backed houses with overlapping roofs ; its great communal balai , or council chambers , to which the villagers are summoned by thumps on a 20-foot  | drum made of a tree trunk ; and its pools . I lost count , but I am reasonably sure that the Minangkabaus have more swimming pools per capita than even the Californians ; the route down to Padang is lined on both sides with rectangular concrete tanks used impartially for breeding fish and for bathing . Cradle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of Java that we know much about was a chap called Pithecanthropus , a rather simple-minded prehistoric cousin of ours related to the Neanderthal family on one side and some apes on the other . He left a few bones , discovered by a Dutch scientist in 1891-92 , but no journal , diary , or other observations . I have been to this area more recently and can at least relate how it struck me . It would be too much to say that it has n't changed since Pithecanthropus checked in , some 500,000 years ago ; but certainly it possesses , more than any other section of Indonesia I saw , an air of serene antiquity . Here are the gray monuments of an ages-old civilization : the Buddhist temples of Borobudur and Mendut , the magnificent Hindu shrines of Prambanan ( page 353 ) . Here , too . as Indonesians rarely tire of pointing out to foreigners , is the cradle of Javanese culture ? the center of the shadow-puppet plays , the wayang dances ( page 352 ) , the gong , drum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a city of some 295,000 people , is known today as much for its modern , democratic sultan as for its archaic glories . Hamangku Buwono IX , a vigorous man in his early 40 's , is still guarded by men with wooden spears and approached by his courtiers almost on their elbows . He keeps some 300 dancers and female relatives in quarters to which he alone has access , and has his tea and cigarettes brought to him under a vast yellow umbrella . Yet this same man defied the Japanese occupation forces , worked for Indonesian independence , sends his children to public school , drives his own car ( with a perfectly ordinary license number ) , changes his own tires , and spends a great share of his time on measures for economic reconstruction .  | Few men in Indonesia have as high a public reputation . In neighboring Surakarta , also known as Solo , I visited the kraton or palace of a sultan whose tenure of office seemed a good deal less assured . Paku Buwono XII ( Nail of the Universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to whether he shall retain his kingly role or discard it for some less lucrative profession . " Sultans , " as one citizen remarked to me somberly , are very expensive . " Mirrors hang everywhere in Paku Buwono 's palace , to remind one to look into his soul and purify it . I looked , and found in myself a keen appreciation of what Paku Buwono might be giving up . For one thing , there 's the drowsy peace in his courtyards . His reception rooms have no doors , not even walls : blue-tiled and spacious , they open out onto shady quadrangles of neatly swept sand . The tinkle of gamelan music drifted across to me from one quarter , the murmur of girls rehearsing the wayang from another . In the library scholars sitting on mats Bandung Conference Shows the Flags of 29 Asian and African Nations In an unprecedented assemblage , delegates of countries from Liberia to Japan met April 18 , 1955 , in Java 's most modern city .

In the museum an attendant carefully dusted the sultan 's two dozen golden arrows , his fully caparisoned wooden horses , his collection of masks ; outside , beneath a slender tree , a sentry dozed beside a musket taller than he . I looked in , later , on a puppet-maker 's shop across a brook on the outskirts of Surakarta . The proprietor 's eyes looked a bit bloodshot : he not only manipulates his puppets against their lamp-lit screen but supplies the running narrative for their adventures . drawn from Indo-Javanese legend . The night before , it turned out , he had been reciting from 11 p.m. till 6 in the morning ! Batik Makers Wax and Dip Another distinctive Surakarta industry is batik making . In a labyrinthine " factory " of stone-floored rooms heavy with the smell of hot wax and wood fires , about 100 men and women were making the dyed and printed kain worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chemical dyes now imported from Germany , Japan , and the United States , the process can have changed little for centuries .

Each piece of batik may have to be rewaxed and dipped 12 to 15 times and takes at least 10 days to finish ( page 369 ) . walked through the shop with a sense of having slipped back into the Middle Ages . Groups of four and five women squatted around each little stove , using the same pot of wax . Men selected stamps from long racks , bent over their cloth , and sang snatches of wayang . Other workers fed the boilers with logs and plunged their steaming bundles into the hot vats . Everyone seemed bathed in brown dye : the very air seemed brown . I had saved Bali for the last .

Honesty compels me to record that if , by some mistake in schedules , I should ever arrive in heaven , it will seem , after Bali , a distinct disappointment. * Naturally , those who do not particularly care for a landscape as poetic and softly modeled as Tahiti 's or a people for whom art and religion , inextricably entwined , contain the whole terror and beauty of life , will be quite unmoved by Bali . They would be quite unmoved by heaven , too . Stone Demons Guard Author 's Cottage My cottage was on the beach below Sanur , southeast of Denpasar . It was roofed with alang-alang grass , walled with palm mats , and floored with bamboo strips through which the sea breeze blew gently at night . Above me nodded coconut palms ; around me grew a mildly controlled riot of tropical flowers which we called a garden . Here and there along the coral paths stood small stone gods and friendly demons with scarlet hibiscus tucked behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laughter of fishermen going past by lantern light on their way to the reefs . A little later there would be the splash of early bathers , and then I would see the girl who each morning padded silently about with a tray of little offerings , refreshing the flowers and leaving gifts before our household shrines . Presently the light , swift notes of the bamboo ting klik would tell me that one of the boys had abandoned the making of breakfast for a moment to try to recapture a tune he had heard the night before . By day I would sometimes watch Bali 's painters and sculptors at work . At Ubud , in a bare studio beside a rocky , fern-draped gorge , men like Dewa Njoman Leper and Ida Bagus Made would sit for hours on the floor before their easels , quiet , contemplative , and yet amused , creating their vivid , crowded canvases of village life . Bali 's sculpture , you might say , owes its vitality to its mortality : the soft paras stone of which the temple gods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must renew its heritage ? not merely stand back and admire the old masters . This is responsible , too , for some strange anomalies . On many a seemingly timeless wall one can find carvings of airplanes and motorcycles . Often on these expeditions I would en- counter a procession . It might be a village taking its deities down to the sea for ritual purification or it might be a great festival of the rice goddess , such as we saw once at Ubud . Down the mountain wove in single file a chain of more than 600 men and women and children , a rivulet of color . Little boys came first , carrying tall , thin banners of white and red , shaped like goose quills . Their sisters followed , on their heads sheaves of rice decked out with flowers . The women next , with larger offerings , and then the men wielding two-handed swords and spears , guarding the arklike shrines of the gods themselves , and last the benevolent , comic figures of the tiger and the bull , monsters of papier mache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound along a steep path and then across a swaying 40-foot-high bamboo bridge . Beyond lay an exquisite temple set at the confluence of two rivers , upon an island of emerald turf and lofty trees . There may be lovelier places to worship . I just do n't happen to have seen them . Music and Dance Typify Bali Evenings , we would often dine under an arbor by the sea , and , if we were celebrating . listen to a barong group beating out its strong , masculine music on gongs and drums . Later we might walk or ride in the moonlight to some village which would be holding a ketjak or a djoged dance . It was at such a small kampong ? Saba -- -that I first saw Ida Bagus Oka perform . We had been the guests of Anak Agunz Gde Raka , younger son of a local prince . at a " rice-table " in his compound . It was his group which was to dance , and after we had finished our coffee we could watch him help to make up his dancers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light a gasoline lantern hanging from a pillar . Anak Agung would take a girl 's grave little face in one of his big hands and with the other darken the eyebrow line . using a palm twig dipped in diluted charcoal . We had picked up Ida Bagus Oka , a slight unimpressive youth in slacks and a blue shirt . in his own village and brought him with us to Saba . Now we saw him gradually transform himself before our eyes into a splendid ( Continued on page 391 ) * See " Bali and Points East , " by Maynard Owen Williams , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , March . 1939. p 391 eature of gold and green and scarlet damask . But the true metamorphosis took place Iv as he began to dance . The youth was ne ; the mature , utterly controlled artist ood in his place before the temple . " An rtist to his finger tips " ? we use the phrase only as a metaphor . Here it meant just that : Oka 's fingers were alive , quivering , electric with tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked once what her dance had meant , she replied : " If I could have said it , do you suppose I should have danced it ? " I can not tell you what Ida Bagus Oka 's dance " meant . " You would have to see it yourself to understand it ? and to believe it . I can only tell you he seemed that night a vivid , incandescent moth who fluttered very close indeed to the heart of absolute beauty . So , too , with Bali itself . Its gay cockfights , its raucous cremations ( pages 370-371 ) , its fantastic trance dancing , its tranquil life of paddy and kampong and temple ? these can not be satisfactorily exported in words or even pictures . They must be experienced . How long they will be there to experience before Bali succumbs to the subtle erosion of tourism is anybody 's guess . The time that remains is precious . Wartime Effects Still Oppressive When that global gadabout Marco Polo first glimpsed Indonesia , he wrote of Java , with his usual enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be past telling . " Yet , 663 years later , Indonesia struggles along on a woefully meager per-capita income . Five years of independence have not seen the standard of living rise much beyond prewar levels . Why ? In the words of former Finance Minister Dr. Sumitro Djojohadikusumo , " Too many do n't realize that years of Japanese occupation , internal strife , two military actions , disruption of productive output , disintegration of authority , social dislocations , and all that these things entail , can not fail to make their effects felt for years and years to come . " The statistics bear him out . Under Japanese occupation , for instance , with Dutch managers and overseers in prison , output of rubber fell to about 20 percent , coffee almost to 30 percent , tea down to 5 percent . Again , think of a field very closely related to the nation 's ability to work : its health . In east Java alone 50 percent shiver through at least one malaria attack a year . Nearly 2% million suffer from tuberculosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of medical force has Indonesia to cope with this situation ? About one doctor for every 57,000 people ! This same shortage of trained personnel runs right through the economy ? lawyers , engineers , agronomists , teachers , plumbers , electricians . You name it , and they have n't it . The plans for Indonesia 's reconstruction and progress are mostly down on paper now , and they are good plans . The problem is , who is going to carry them out , and when ? All Indonesia Goes to School Perhaps the most important fact about Indonesia , however , is that it wants so desperately to learn . For every tale of inefficiency and muddling I picked up in my rounds ? and you can hear as many as you have patience to absorb ? I can recall people I met around Indonesia who were doing their level best , against great odds , to help themselves and their country to grow and mature . I think of my friend Haroun el-Raschid , former Chief Justice of Sumatra , now serving as head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers . His monthly salary would not suffice to purchase one automobile tire . I think of a high-school boy I met in Surakarta , who studies in the morning and then teaches in the afternoon . It is through the efforts of such people that Indonesia has cut its illiteracy from about 93 to 45 percent and hopes ( optimistically , perhaps ) to eliminate it by 1961 . It has raised the number of primary schools from 18,000 in 1940 to 32,000 today , its high schools from 144 to 2,700 , its student body from 2 million to more than 8 million . Textbooks , laboratory equipment , teachers are still pitiably short , and classes may be held in nipa-thatched huts . But the achievement remains impressive ( page 383 ) . On the medical front , I recall a Kalimantan doctor whose practice covers a jungle territory with some 300,000 people in it ; to reach the northern sector he has to go upriver by outboard motor for six hours . With untrained nurses , no anesthetist , no X-ray , an old Australian army cot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see by , no sheets on the beds and a charcoal hearth for a kitchen , this man carries on with growing effectiveness .  | Bonneted Backseat Driver Takes a Dim View of Things on a Sumatra Plantation Rice powder protects this child 's face against the sun . Her parents , chatting with the wife of a company official , work for one of Indonesia 's " Big Four " tobacco firms . Sumatran leaf is favored for cigar wrappers . By prewar standards especially , the lot of a foreigner in nationalistic Indonesia is not enviable , and many have left . I like to remember one Dutch friend of mine , however , who is staying on . In the prime of life , his eyesight has begun to fail . Yet he works all day for a government agency ? and then gives his evenings to teaching the Indonesians who will eventually replace him . Time All-important to Indonesia In some parts of Indonesia , if you ask a man in the paddies how far it is to a certain town , he will calculate it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook . He may well have seen a watch , but time in the Western sense is still a bit unreal to him . Among a great many Indonesians , however , an awareness of what time means to their young Republic is becoming increasingly sharp . They know that independence by itself is no simple panacea . They know that , while their economy rests on the solid foundation of a fertile soil , its business superstructure is still rickety , and that its shoring up must begin now , before it is too late . An industrialist in Medan said to me : " We are making progress . Our export and import trade is in balance at last . But to conquer our chief problems will take us 25 years , maybe a hundred . What I ask myself is , will the world give us even five That was the question uppermost in my mind as I left Indonesia .
