Red China , hard up for dollars , got some very simply-by postal money order . <P> Pickup . In April 1950 , Honolulu post-office officials began to notice that money orders made out by Filipinos in Hawaii and Guam were not being cashed in the Philippines , as they were supposed to be ; instead , they were coming back with " chops " ( post officialese for seals ) , showing that they were being handled by Hong Kong banks . U.S. post-office officials got suspicious , sent Inspector R. Frank Ogden , 53 , to Hong Kong to investigate . <P> A Hong Kong money changer , who owed the police a little reward for past favors , talked . From Hong Kong the trail led to Manila , and grew hotter ; once a jeep full of Tommy-gun-toting men ran Ogden to the curb and almost did him in . Finally , in the dusty villages outside Manila , he and Filipino intelligence agents discovered the grassroots base of the racket . <P> Agents for Red Chinese syndicates would hang around country post offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money orders from relatives in Hawaii , Guam or the U.S. The agents offered an irresistible bargain : they were ready to buy up the money orders , paying three pesos per dollar ( the official exchange rate is only two , but the Reds did not mind spending pesos freely in order to get far scarcer dollars ) . Endorsed over to middlemen for the Chinese , the orders were then smuggled to Hong Kong by plane and deposited in U.S. banks . <P> Many of the money orders were small , and the amounts were often changed by clever forgers , e.g. , $1.37 to $1,379.44 . The Reds raked in $4,000,000 a month . Together with other gimmicks-completely forged postal orders , veterans ' checks bought up for pesos-the Reds made an estimated $32 million in less than a year , using the money to buy war materials . <P> Crackdown . When Ogden reported his findings , police and customs men moved fast . At Hong Kong , customs officers saw a Chinese sneak aboard a plane in the airport hangar and emerge carrying twelve fat envelopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airfields , $171,000 more was confiscated . In Manila , an informer led Ogden to a man who offered to sell him 500 counterfeit money-order blanks at 25 pesos ( $12.50 ) each , and obligingly showed him the printing plant where they were being turned out . Police nabbed the forgers . <P> Ogden 's eight months of plodding through Oriental back alleys was over . The Chinese Reds had to look for a new way to make a fast buck .
