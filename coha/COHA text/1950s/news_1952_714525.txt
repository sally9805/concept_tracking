A Stock Market Appraisal Thus far the month of March is living up to traditional market expectations . All three averages show pretty good gains from the end of February . Brokers also report a stimulated investment demand , particularly in heavy industry stocks . The Street is quite elated over the avid demand for new equities In fact , by and large ' all types of new corporate financing have reflected investors ' demand for securities , all provided prices have been " right . " Investment brokers say there is no reason to expect this sort of demand will die down in the foreseeable future , though it is believed that there will be a Vit more of such financing before election . There is a lot of bearishness about both in business and in some groups in the Street but this has been the case for some months and so far as the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far disturbed by the let-down in some departments of industry . Street economists say ; that , for some little time past , increased defense production has probably been more than offset by the downtrend in consumer goods industries . However , some of the Street statisticians expect the latter to improve somewhat as spring comes in . Further , a lot of over-extended inventory situations have been partly adjusted , say observers . Caution in trade is the watchword and even the gradual relaxation of controls is not expected to bring about increased inventories . In fact , both in business and the stock market there is a strong tendency to wait and see what is going to happen as we approach election day .

Meanwhile , there are the usual large amounts of investment buying orders on hand well under the market to act as a cushion . It is not felt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runaway market , either way , in the next few months . although this prediction is not meant to hold true for individual stocks . With traders more active , special situations may provide some dynamic moves in coming months , as recently have been seen in the oils and some other issues , say market pundits . Concentrated buying and selling , in thin markets , is capable of producing movements which might readily run into excesses . Heavy industry shares which have been backward appear to be coming to the fore on the up side , although some of the leaders show " heavy going . " With controls gradually easing , some of these companies , it is felt in the Street , will be able to do better for themselves and perhaps this is what the market is beginning to stir about , particularly in steels and motors . ? ? ? **26;818;TOOLONG common stock has been strong in recent markets , selling at new highs . This strength is based , according to Street talk , on its oil potential and recognition of the fact its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate subsidiary , has rather widespread oil interests , including mineral rights to 3,700 acres in part of the Williston Basin . Nearest holdings to producing wells are seven miles from the discovery well and one other producing well of Amerada Petroleum . The most promising rights , according to Harry McClelland. president of Capital Co .. are around Bismarck , N , D , which were acquired from Occidental Life Insurance , another Transamerica subsidiary . " We have held these rights for 10 years . " Mr. McClelland says , " and the only difference now is that there is proven oil in some parts of the Williston Basin . We do n ' -t intend to do any wildcatting ourselves , and the fact that Amerada has two nearby wells is not expected to have any immediate effect on our holdings . " Capital Co.
