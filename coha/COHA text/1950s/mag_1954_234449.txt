Since everyone in Massachusetts knew that blue-blooded Senator Leverett Saltonstall and Governor Christian Herter would be endorsed for reelection , Republicans meticulously printed a timetable ( " 10 a.m. come to order , 10:50 a.m. nominate Herter . . . " ) for their pre-primary convention . Last week , as the convention met at Worcester , both Saltonstall and Herter were nominated only minutes behind schedule , and the convention fell behind the clock badly only once because of a squabble over a nomination ' for state treasurer . <P> Such Republican precision contrasted sharply with the hectic Democratic convention at Worcester the week before . It took the Democrats twelve hours and five ballots to nominate State Representative Robert F. Murphy for governor . For Senator they took only one ballot to endorse State Treasurer Foster Furcolo , who carried two distinctions : 1 ) a onetime favorite of Americans for Democratic Action , he had repudiated A.D.A. ; and 2 ) although his mother came from Ireland , his Italian name violated the Massachusetts Democratic orthodoxy that senatorial candidates should have an Irish name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall . But Saltonstall has reason to be worried about fast-rising Foster Furcolo.
