GOODS &; SERVICES <P> At St. Paul 's Minnesota Mining &; Manufacturing Co. , they like to describe their business as " pulling rabbits out of a bottomless hat . " To 3M the bottomless hat is its research department , and last week the company pulled out a promising new rabbit . The rabbit : " Scotchply. " a tough , laminated plastic sheet , sinewed with tiny glass threads , that 3M thinks is better than steel because of its strength-weight ratio . <P> Unlike other reinforced plastics which must be built up layer after layer , Scotchply can be worked like wood or molded like metal ; it is shatterproof , rotproof , waterproof , can be sawed , drilled , cemented or polished . As production began last week , the company saw a potential market for Scotchply in everything from air frames to auto parts and delicate printed circuits . The one drawback : its current high price of $2 a lb. , which the company hopes to cut down with mass production . <P> Thousands of Rabbits . Based on 3M 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since 1902 , 3M has pioneered a line of some 25,000 separate items , from sandpaper to its famed Scotch tape , and grown into an empire of 30 plants stretching from the U.S. to Germany and Brazil . This year sales will jump to $228 million , up $8.000,000 from 1953 ; earnings are expected to hit a record $2.80 a share , and the value of its shares has increased 5.804% since 1929 . <P> The key to 3M 's success is pioneering research and a management that knows how to sell what it discovers . Board Chairman William McKnight , 67 , and President Herbert P. Buetow , 56 , both of whom worked up through 3M 's ranks , are dedicated researchers who plow back 3 of every sales dollar into the search for new products . When an idea catches on , 3M helps customers think up new uses and puts its scientists to work on a whole family of related products . In 1934 , 3M brought out a new electrical insulating tape with plastic backing that was such a hit the company soon expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putty , wire-splicing devices and a painted-on wire coating for the electrical industry . Total business , where none was before : $2,000,000 annually . <P> From Rocks to Scotch . 3M 's many handed business was born with a single discovery during World War 1 : a new kind of sandpaper that flexed without cracking or shedding the abrasive . It was followed by a waterproof " Wetordry " sandpaper that was an instant success in the auto industry ; for the first time carmakers could wet surfaces to be sanded or polished , thus eliminating heat and dust . In 1930 , 3M brought out Scotch tape , and started a new industry . The tape replaced pins , string and glue , was put to work mending , sealing packages , insulating wires , masking paint jobs . Today 3M gets 35% of its total sales from Scotch tape , including Scotchlite , a reflecting sheeting coated with tiny glass balls and used for advertising signs or red warning strips on car bumpers . Among the thousands of other products are lithographic plates for the printing industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concrete , synthetic rubber , furniture polish , and a line of fluorochemicals to make ordinary paper both water and oilproof.
