Behind the grey faade of the House of Unity in East Berlin 's Karl Liebknecht Platz sits the Politburo of 14 men who rule East Germany on orders from the Kremlin . From their conference room last week came pronouncements which launched a new and cunning Soviet maneuver in the cold war . <P> To lyrics written in Moscow and a melody plagiarized from the song of the Lorelei , East German Premier Otto Grotewohl announced a big turnabout in Communist tactics in East Germany .

" Some of the decisions : <P> To make peace with Bishop Otto Dibelius and the Evangelical Church , to which most of East Germany 's 18 million people belong . In a formal pact , the Communists agreed to end persecution of church leaders and youth groups , to void or review jail terms handed out to about 20 pastors . Among other things , the Communists promised to recognize the church 's right of free assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , and work out plans to restore religious lessons to Soviet zone classrooms . <P> To halt the unpopular farm collectivization program at its present level ( about 10% of East German farmland ) . <P> <P> To lower the high crop quotas , which led many farmers to flee to the West . <P> To assure the 1,800,000 East Germans who had fled West that they may come home without fear , get back their confiscated property and full civil rights . <P> To encourage " private industry , " virtually wiped out in eight years of Russian bolshevization .

On the face of it , the new program represented retreat , an admission of failure of Russia 's eight-year attempt to bolshevize East Germany . The Communists , confessed Premier Grotewohl , had made a " series of mistakes " which were now being rectified .

The turnabout was , in part at least , dictated by the unbearable hardships , the hunger , the shortages and bureaucratic chaos which Soviet postwar rule had imposed on East Germany .                  @ @ @
