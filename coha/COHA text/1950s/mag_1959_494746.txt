The Arithmetic of Slum Clearance by Oscar .71 . ? Steiner Back in 1933 a Catholic priest , now Monsignor R. B. Navin , president of St. John College in Cleveland , showed us how to do the arithmetic of slum clearance . His study , entitled " Analysis of a Slum Area , " covered a near-downtown Cleveland tract of 333 acres already badly eroded by decay and obsolescence . It disclosed that the tract yielded $225,000 in real property taxes , while expenditures for municipal housekeeping and for public and private health and welfare purposes amounted to $2 million - a net deficit of $1,750,000 . Over every four-year period the taxpayers of Cleveland were paying out an amount equal to the appraised value of the tract without acquiring title to it . The same sort of economic analysis has now been conducted on slums elsewhere . James W. Follin , while serving as Federal Urban Renewal Commissioner , observed in a speech before the University of Michigan School of Public Health : " An Eastern city , in one year , received $io8 more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but its slums cost $88 more per person than they yielded . In one Southern city , slum areas contributed only 5.5 percent of the city 's property taxes , but required 53 percent of the city 's health , police , fire and other service facilities . " According to another expert estimate , it costs local government in the average city about $6o per person to service its entire citizenry each year . In slum areas the per capita costs are $140 a year . Cities like Baltimore , Cleveland , Boston , Buffalo and St. Louis are each pouring $7,000,000 to $8,000,000 a year into slum drains . On a national basis , with over 20 million living in slums , our bill easily exceeds $2 billion . annually . These are the direct , tangible costs . Who can put a price on the human losses ? Surely , there would be sweet gains to the spirit and to the security of our society , as well as our pocketbooks , if the slums could be erased . But here we are concerned with defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's make certain we understand the arithmetic lesson Msgr . Navin first taught . To approach it from a somewhat different angle , let 's create a hypothetical city and see what happens to its finances when one of its residential sections succumbs to decay . Take , for example , a city that has land and buildings valued for tax purposes at $300 million with an over-all tax levy of $3333 per thousand dollar valuation . This means a realty tax income of $10 million in round numbers . To keep the illustration simple let 's assume that two-thirds of the municipal revenue comes from real estate taxes . The remaining income is derived from public utilities , personal property and miscellaneous sources . To have a balanced budget , the city 's expenses must be kept within that $15 million income . We have : This then is the situation when all areas are physically sound and financially self sustaining . Now let 's say that blight strikes Tract " B " , transforming it into a slum . Slum blight hits two ways : it radically reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along with this , the cost of servicing Tract " B " climbs sharply . Tract " B " now requires $1,500,000 instead of $1,000 , - 000 to service it annually . This is a realistic estimate considering the Tract 's soaring crime rate , the increased fire hazards , the higher incidence of disease , delinquency , poverty and other demands on the city 's social services . In line with this analysis we can expect Tract " B " to produce reduced tax revenues amounting to only 10 percent of its service costs , or less than $150,000 . Our theoretical city now has tax incomes as follows : Recall that before the slum blight struck , it required $15,000,000 to operate our city . It now requires $500 , 000 more to service the slum area . This means an overall municipal outlay of $15,500,000 . In tabulation our city now faces a deficit . Our city is now operating at an annual deficit of $1,350,000 . To balance its budget its taxes must be increased 9.5 percent , or its bond indebtedness raised . Virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deterioration of property values , particularly in the slum area . Using our $33.33 per thousand tax figure , Tract " B " is now producing $150,000 in tax revenue against $1,000,000 formerly produced . This tax loss transferred into property values involves a decline from $30,000,000 to $4,500,000  --  a property value loss to the city of over $25,000,000 in Tract " B " alone . This does not take into consideration the devitalizing effect of this slum blight on the real estate values in the balance of the city . Let us go a step further . Assume that there are approximately 5,000 dwelling units in Tract " B " ( this is based on an average tax value now reduced to slightly under $1,000 per unit ) . Now let us place the cost of buying up an average slum unit , and clearing it at $8,000 . ( This is too high . It should be nearer $6,000 , but we want to be conservative in our figures . ) The 5,000 slum units , therefore , involve an outlay of $40,000,000. $40,000,000 ! Every realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tug at his wallet and asks : " How much is this going to cost me ? " But the $40,000 , - 000 is not a permanent outlay . It is an investment because the cleared land , when improved with decent housing , will have regained its tax valuation of $30,000 , - 000 . It will have appreciated in value $25,000,000 against a clearance cost of $40,000,000 . But see what it means to the city as a whole : 1 . A slum area has been cleared away at a cost of $40,000,000 , compensated by tax valuation improved by more than $25,000,000. 2 . The city as the owner of the land will be reimbursed through its resale . 3 . The city will have eliminated an $1,350,000 annual deficit directly traceable to the slum blight . Without making any allowance for the resale value of the cleared land or the increased tax valuation , this saving is equal to more than 3.25 percent on its investment in clearing out the slum area . ( Note that I say investment and not expense , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being an expense , is a sound recoverable investment . By reversing the rising tax trend and eliminating our slums we may do much to slow up the flight of industry and richer citizens to the suburbs ; a trend that may spell financial trouble if not reversed . In New Haven , Conn. , where this trend has been reversed in one area , Mayor Lee was quoted as saying , " New Haven 's Oak Street development ? 44 acres in the heart of town ? was a slum costing New Haven $200 , - 000 annually for fire , police , health and other services , while bringing about $105,00o in property taxes . " H. Ralph Taylor , urban renewal director , estimates that when an urban redevelopment project is completed , tax revenues will have tripled and cost of service cut in half . Here is the before-and-after New Haven dollar tab-ulation : Washington , D. C. , reports that its large slum clearance program known as the southwest renewal area is expected to boost the section 's tax yield from $451,000 to $3,430,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increased tax yield , over-all , of $7,000,000 annually , an amount sufficient to amortize the district 's whole renewal cost in ten years . Some people may say that we should expect higher municipal taxes and bonded indebtedness because the cost of living is steadily rising ? in other words , because of inflation . Actually , tax rates should remain stable and the additional costs of municipal services should be compensated for by a natural increase in property values brought about by healthy growth . Growth should yield the required larger gross tax return and would do so if operating costs did not rise out of proportion . Tax rates and tax income should not be confused . Rising tax rates and higher bonded debt mean that a larger portion of a community 's wealth is needed to maintain the community . In 1948 there were 14 cities in the United States with populations of 5 oo , 000 or more . The total population of these cities was 24.5 million , and the annual income and expenses for the 14 cities averaged slightly more than $100 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities was slightly more than 25 million persons and the per capita municipal income and expense was $150 . An increase in operating costs and revenue requirements of 5o percent in eight years ! The net long-term indebtedness of these 14 cities averaged $168 per capita in 1950 and $254 per capita in 1956 ? a jump of 5o percent in six years . The total indebtedness had jumped from $3.7 billion in 1950 to $6.5 billion six years later . Our cities , it 's obvious , are in financial trouble . Slum deficits are largely responsible and the slums are spreading . What happens when slums spread ? A larger and larger share of the community 's mounting tax burden falls on home owners in the shrinking good areas and on the factories , stores and office buildings . Home owners in the better neighborhoods do n't get the services they are paying for because the tax revenues are diverted to subsidizing the poor sections . Industry can deal with rising tax rates and declining services by moving to outlying suburban areas , thereby intensifying the problems of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it has , it is only because capital investment in the form of building and fixed equipment is relatively frozen . In many cases , higher tax rates in the aging cities discourage commercial and industrial renovation and expansion . Factories in the older sections are allowed to deteriorate or become obsolete . Retail stores , of course , pass their higher property taxes on to the consumer . The owners of homes in the sound , stable neighborhoods , if they trade at them , will be paying twice for slums ? in higher taxes on their own property and in higher prices in the stores . Arithmetic and reflection should alert us to the economic threat our slums constitute . Our money and our future are tied up in them . We all own the slums.
