txt A severe winter , with a hundred destitute men , women , and children frozen to death in Paris has crystallized public opinion into a great outcry to end t h e colonial war in IndoChina . The press and everyone I have spoken to are indignant that the French government has spent 7 billion dollars in fighting this war but has failed to build housing for the growing Paris population . The majority in parliament has long demanded " peace by negotiation " with Ho Chi Minh , leader of the Viet Minh opposing French forces . Aim at Huge Spending Criticism of Premier Laniel and his cabinet centers on one target  --  the 11/2 billion dollars a year he is spending on the war in Indo-China and the pittance he assigns for new housing . The consensus is that France will be driven to make peace in Indo-China this year , regardless of pressure by President Eisenhower to continue the war as a bulwark against the spread of communism . In the last year , with the President offering huge sums to France to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . " Why must we spend billions and lose thousands of lives in a war 10,000 miles away that we can never win while thousands of our people in France are exposed to death by freezing and privations ? " newspaper editorials ask . Pleven at War Scene " How dare the United States order us to keep fighting in Indo-China after they have ended their own war in Korea ? Are we mercenaries to shed the blood of our sons merely to obey the policy of Washington regarding communism ? " the papers inquire . Defense Minister Rene Pleven is in Indo-China , where he will confer with the head of the United States mission . Pleven will ask for more American airplanes and several United States navy carriers to help fight the war . He will hint for American troops . Never Paid Their Way For years Communists and leftists have called the struggle in Indo-China " the dirty war " on the ground that it is carried on for the sole benefit of the Banque D'Indo - Chine , the Michelin rubber plantations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the colony and have a strangle hold on imports , exports , and finance . The associated states of Laos , Cambodia , and Viet Nam , as the colony is now called , have never paid theirxay . But they have proved a fabulous asset for the " great bank , " for rich and powerful colonists , and for the horde of men who operate the opium , illicit gold , and similar rackets . The huge traffic in piastres , the Indo Chinese currency redeemed by the Banque de France in Paris at double their value , was crushed only last spring , when it was feared the Premier Lanlel United States might refuse to finance the war because of the scandal . The war could have been averted in 1946 when Ho Chi Minh , the revolutionary leader , and the French government signed an accord in Paris . But the then governor of IndoChina , Adm . Thierry D'Argenlieu and his general , Claude Valluy , suddenly ordered a heavy bombardment of Viet Minh guerrillas who approached a customs house . Replies with Massacre The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reprisal and the war was on . Since then France has sent all her leading generals to the scene , but none has been able to put down the revolution . For years the War cost France 1 million dollars a day . Now waste , inefficiency , and graft have swelled the cost to 11/2 billion dollars a year , of which the United States forks over nearly 800 millions . Another 600 millions is promised for the fiscal year 1954-55 . A great part of this huge sum goes to raising a native , Indo-Chinese army . These battalions are expected to reinforce the French units - and achieve victory . Natives vs . Natives But eye witness newspaper correspondents on the scene insist in French dailies that the native battalions are practically worthless . The war correspondents state that the Viet Nam soldiers will not fire on their Viet Minh brothers and either quit or desert with their ** France has 200,000 natives under arms and expects to have 325,000 by the end of the year . She also has 200,000 " French troops , " who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No French Recruits The national assembly has steadfastly refused to send French recruits to the far east , and no government has ever dared to force that issue . France was shocked when the Viet Nam " parliament " rejected incorporation in the " French overseas union , " as the old empire is now called . Until then , the government here had insisted that the war was only to protect the independent " associated states from being overrun by Communists . But it develops that French ideas of independence " are quite different from what the Indo-Chinese want . Under present terms , France will retain the right to represent Indo-China in foreign affairs . It perpetuates the throttling grip of the " great bank " and other vested interests on the economy . The French military hierarchy in Paris is sharply split on the war . Younger officers , seeking promotion , are all for it . Older officers believe that France should concentrate her military strength in Europe , as a balance to Germany . They also foresee serious trouble in Morocco which is a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
