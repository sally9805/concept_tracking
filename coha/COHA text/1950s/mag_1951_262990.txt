Atomic Housecleaning Reporting for work at General Electric 's plutonium plant in Hanford , Wash. , a night watchman began the routine of checking in . He stopped before an Alpha radiation counter about the size and shape of a soft-drink machine , casually stuck his hands in , and listened for the amplified clicks by which the sensitive instrument registers its count . The chatter he heard from the machine shocked the startled patrolman right out of his routine , sent him rushing to the Health Instruments Division . There , doctors quickly confirmed the machine 's verdict . His hands were emitting more radiation than a radium watch dial . <P> Under questioning , the contaminated patrolman tried to remember where he could have picked up his dose of radiation . Finally he recalled that on his rounds the night before , he had come across a broken wrench . Unaware that it had been used on equipment for processing plutonium , he had taken the wrench home , figuring that it might come in handy around the house . <P> A crew of technicians raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to test the suspected wrench and the patrolman 's home . Both proved to be radioactive . At once , the intricate machinery of the Atomic Age whirred into action . <P> With Soap &; Water . With a portable Alpha counter the technicians began retracing the patrolman 's path from the plant all the way to Richland . The path was none too well marked . He had slipped the hot wrench into his metal lunchbox , and the box had acted as a shield-which frustrated the counter and had protected the patrolman 's fellow passengers on the long bus ride home . But the patrolman , his home , his car , and a few areas around the plant ( where he had carried the wrench in his hand ) were hot enough to make the detectors sound off . <P> Clad in white cotton coveralls , and wearing masks to filter out contaminated dust , the decontamination crew went to work . The patrolman moved into a company dormitory , and for the next six days his house got the kind of spring cleaning that many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything ( including the unhappy patrolman ) was swabbed down with soap &; water . Later , all the cleaning gear was carefully collected , carted off and tossed on to a restricted disposal dump . <P> Frying Pans &; Slip Covers . Alpha particles had been sucked into the hot air heating system , so the whole house was suspect . But the bulky portable counter , which can only operate close to the source of radiation , could n't fit into every corner . Taking no chances , the decontamination crew followed a simple rule : if it ca n't be checked , chuck it out . The whole furnace was ripped out and destroyed . Any articles that could easily be replaced were also discarded . Frying pans , slip covers , clothes , all went to the dump , to be replaced at Government expense . <P> This week the patrolman , still smarting from a reprimand , was back on the job . Tests showed him out of immediate danger , * and his name was withheld by his cautious employers . But suspicious Richlanders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , were already asking for a personal swabbing down and an atomic housecleaning of their own . <P> <P> * Alpha activity is not harmful externally , causes trouble only when it enters the bloodstream through the mouth or cuts in the skin . Hanford has yet to suffer its first fatality from radiation .
