AN AMERICAN IN INDIA ( 277 pp. ) - Sounders Redding - Bobbs - Merrill ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Saunders Redding , 48 , is a good-looking Negro professor of English at Hampton Institute ( Va. ) , one of the nation 's best Negro colleges . One spring day in 1952 , the phone rang in his office and a voice said : " This is the State Department . Would you be available for a temporary foreign assignment ? " Professor Redding was available ; the assignment was India . That summer he traveled 25,000 miles through India , lecturing on America to tens of thousands of curious and often hostile students and professors . <P> On the plane going over , Redding vowed to tell the unvarnished truth about America . Returning , he has told the startling truth about India in a clean , calm book . Author Redding 's dismaying conclusion is that Indian democracy , never firm , is in deadly danger of Communist subversion . Some may think Redding exaggerates , but a world that scoffed at similar warnings from China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Urge to Defend . As a Negro ( " dozens of Indians told me that I was ' one of them ' because I looked like a Madrasi . . . " ) , Professor Redding could penetrate layers of Indian life that are closed to white men . It was his job to speak up for America , and he did so ; but India 's universities made him suffer for it . Because of his color , he was urged to heap abuse on all white men , and particularly on white Americans . When he spoke , instead , of improving race relations in the U.S. , his hot-eyed young listeners denounced him as a hireling of " American imperialism . " The American found this ironic , for India 's rectitudinous liberals were as intolerantly racist in their attitude toward white men as Daniel Malan is in his dealings with the blacks . <P> On campus after campus , Redding found that hatred of America is an unwritten part of the curriculum . Hecklers bombarded him : " America carries on germ warfare . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans Go Home . " As evidence of American " sex madness , " students in Bombay produced fake pictures of coeds being stripped by American college boys -a farfetched reference to the spring fever " panty raids " of 1952 . In Poona the students had been shown newsreel films of U.S. infantrymen threatening a parade of workers , but , as Redding quickly pointed out , it was 20 years out of date . The workers were the bonus marchers who descended on Washington in 1932.
