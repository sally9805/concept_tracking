txt If it now is touch and go for a free-trade area of all Western Europe ? as it . seems to be ? then it is also touch and go for the unity of Europe . There is increasing support here for this serious appreciation of the situation . And that fact itself makes the successful establishment of a free-trade area more likely than it otherwise seems . Otherwise there is an air of crisis . One essential nation , France , is without a government . The most crucial stage of the preliminary negotiations should have begun . It can not yet be reached . But the point at issue , at its simplest , now is seen to be whether there will be one Western Europe or two . One by one the nations involved are having to face this issue . None will deliberately opt for division . Therefore the feelings grows that a way to include all Western Europe in a free-trade area must be found , and that because it must be found it will be found Extension Proposed The common market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Luxemboourg , West per , already a fact . Britain has has proposed in addition a free-Germany , and Italy ? is , on pa-trade area that would include the common market area but overlap it , bringing in possibly 12 oother countries from Iceland to Turkey . This plan is as controversial as if . would be complicated . It has met considerable opposition . But the significant thing is that the peak of this opposition seems at last to have passed . The major opponent has been France . France only gingerly , with many reservations , entered the six-nation European Economic Community . Until recently , at any rate , French industrialists have been solidly against going further still and multiplying the competition they might have to face . Now , it is claimed , there are signs  --  small signs  --  that even French opinion is beginning to change , Certainly the Italian Confederation of Industry , hitherto as strongly opposed to the free-trade area plan as the French , shows signs of coming round to favor it . For the first time , on April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic journal , Il Bonn Support Accented West German support for the idea , although not the details , was confirmed at the recent talks between Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer . The Netherlands is a strong supporter . Employers in Austria , Scandinavia , and Switzerland recently joined those of Britain in presenting a modified free-trade-area plan of their own . The point that is getting home is that when the six-nation EEC starts , on Jan. 1 , 1959 , then on that day discrimination starts again in Europe . Unless , that is , all the nations of Western Europe are joined that day also in a wider free-trade area . There are 17 Western European nations . On Jan. 1 , 1959 , without a free-trade area , 12 would find themselves on the outside of newly raised barriers of tariffs and quotas , The proportions of tariffs involved may be small-10 per cent of the existing percentage of all tariffs  --  but the fact of the discrimination involved would be tremendous . It would reverse the course of postwar European economic history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No Discrimination ? For instance , the European Payments Union , which has made trade liberalization possible , essentially based on that principle . The EPU is due for renewal in June . Can it possibly be renewed ? Can Switzerland , for example , be expected to give wholesale credits to countries newly engaged in discriminating against Switzerland ? Or anyone else ? Can the six really afford to discriminate against Britain , when Britain is the largest European buyer by far of both their agricultural and industrial products ? Such considerations , as well as the need to start again a Europe-wide economic expansion , lead to the conclusion that . difficult as it is likely to be , and delayed as it now is almost certain to he an agreement on a free-trade area is imperative . In some form , it must happen . That is why there is more optimism here than the news might seem to merit . There is agreement that given the political will to a wider unity , no economic difficulties exist that are insuperable .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
