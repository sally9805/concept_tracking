Into the nation 's twelve main livestock centers last week trampled a horde of hogs that was 40% greater than in the same week last year . As a result , prices in Chicago flopped to $14.35 per 100 lbs. , their lowest level since 1945 . It meant trouble not only for farmers , but also for the Republican Party . Corn-belt voters loudly demanded that Agriculture Secretary Benson come to the rescue with a Government buying program . <P> Minnesota 's Republican Senator Edward J. Thye , among other public officials , backed them up . He asked for a quick , short Government pork-buying program while the fall hog run is at its height . Said a Benson aide : " The Department of Agriculture is watching the hog market closely , and has already developed machinery for making purchases , should they be deemed necessary . Buying could get under way on short notice . " The purchases would amount to something like 170 million lbs. , only 1% of the year 's total expected output . But it is big enough to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's statisticians figure that if the Department buys 6% of a commodity during a given marketing period , it will raise prices about 10% ) . <P> Ezra Benson hesitated to give the order . Pork 's troubles go too deep to be cured easily by price props . U.S. consumers are losing their taste for pork because 1 ) they are cutting down on fatty foods , and 2 ) they followed the advice of the Agriculture Department to eat more beef ( which was a propaganda maneuver to raise beef prices ) back in 1953 . From the 1933-35 period to 1954 , U.S. per-capita beef consumption jumped by some 24 lbs. , to an estimated 79 ; pork consumption edged up by less than 6 lbs. , to 67 . <P> Benson also had the tricky corn-hog ratio to consider . This ratio determines , in effect , whether a farmer can make more money by selling his corn or by feeding it to his hogs ( it takes about 9 bu. of shelled corn to put 100 lbs . on a hog ) . When the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is more profitable to turn the corn into pork ; that was the case through most of 1954 , with the result that the 1954 fall pig crop was 16% bigger than in 1953 , and the 1955 spring pig crop was 9% bigger than in 1954 . To swell the hog population still further , free corn prices on the market have been considerably lower than the Government support price . A farmer eligible for corn support could thus sell his own crop to the Government at $1.58 a bu. , buy corn on the market that was ineligible for support at around $1.20 to feed his pigs . <P> Because of the prospect for more big pig crops , it looked as if Secretary Benson might be pressured by Congressmen into buying up pork . The program would be applied mainly at the processing level-a limited purchasing agreement aimed at cured shoulders , hams and bacon which the Agriculture Department could quickly dispose of through school lunch programs , hospitals and other charitable organizations .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
