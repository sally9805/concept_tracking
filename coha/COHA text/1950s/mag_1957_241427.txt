There was no training table in the dingy dressing room , and so the aging ( 30 ) , beaten fighter had to lie across three wooden folding chairs . He had a bloodstained towel around his head , and he pressed an ice bag against a puffing eye . Except for a short-lived moment four years ago when some thought he had the stuff to go somewhere , Heavyweight Bob Baker , a huge , long-muscled young man from Pittsburgh , had been nothing but a ham-and-egg fighter . Last week , whipped by flashy Eddie Machen , 25 , Baker realized that after 59 pro bouts , his pantry was empty . <P> " I know when I 'm through . " said Baker . " It 's when your will is gone . I got in that ring tonight and I thought , ' Well , here 's another one , and if you win it , well , maybe you get another couple of fights , and if you do n't , maybe you 're through . ' Five or six years ago this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of feints and jab me on the nose or mouth . <P> " I had the good paydays . I went down to Texas to fight that kid . Roy Harris , that 's his name . It was the first mixed bout in Texas . I knew I was going to lose . I was fighting a white boy , and no colored man is going to beat a white boy in Texas . I hit him and he went down , and I thought , ' Why , this boy ca n't fight at all . ' <P> " But I can hear that crowd , and they 're counting on this boy . And I said , ' Kid , please get up . ' I knew that if he did n't get up they were n't going to let me out of that town alive . I love my wife and I love my kid , and most of all I love me . And I told the kid to get up , and I 'm thankful that he did . And after that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " I might fight again . A ham-and-egger for a good purse . But I 'm not going to fight any more good boys . I 'm not a fighter any more . That kid tonight , I do n't know . But I do n't think he was trying to knock me out . And I 'm glad . It 'd be an awful thing for a fighter to end up with someone standing over him counting ten . "
