At dawn one day last week , in the Lima Maternity Hospital , Hilda Trujillo gave birth to a daughter weighing a trifle over six pounds . The mother took no anesthetic , and the five-hour labor was entirely normal ; so was the child , except that it was perhaps a month premature . Not normal : the mother 's age . She was herself a child of nine years , seven months , 28 days . Only a few months ago she wore white cardboard wings and played an angel in the third-grade play at school . <P> Hilda 's mother , a servant , noted something odd about the girl in July , told her mistress , who took Hilda to the doctor . Astonished , he reported that Hilda was five months pregnant . Tearfully , the mother cried : " Let God 's will be done . " Hilda 's father , however , rushed to the police , and they arrested a 22-year-old orphaned cousin who lived with the Trujillos in their one-room shack , charged him with rape . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obstetrician Rolando Colareta , underwent examination by a team of 16 obstetricians , gland specialists , radiologists , psychiatrists and general practitioners . They reported her to be normal , only a little older-looking than other girls of her age . <P> Explained Colareta : " The rape of minors is nothing so unusual here or anywhere else . But of course rape does not mean pregnancy in children so young except in rare cases . " In 30 years as an obstetrician he had seen four such cases in girls under eleven ; Hilda Trujillo was only the second youngest . Eighteen years before he assisted in the case of the youngest : Lina Medina , pregnant at the age of five years , eight months ; mother , by Caesarean section , of a normal boy at the age of six years , five months ( TIME , May 29 , 1939 ) . <P> Last week Hilda 's case rekindled interest in Lina . Now 24 , short , stocky and reclusive , she works as a secretary in the Lima clinic of Dr. Gerardo Lozada , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , is now putting her son through high school , reports : " Lina 's boy is normal and intelligent . He wants to take up electronics . "
