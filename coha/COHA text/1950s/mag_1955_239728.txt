THE DAY LINCOLN WAS SHOT ( 304 pp. ) - Jim Bishop-Harper ( $3.75 ) . <P> The triumph and tragedy of Abraham Lincoln remains one of the great stories of U.S. history , and the poets , professors and politicians never tire of telling it in all its phases . Now an oldtime rewrite man has moved in , read 7,000,000 words of evidence about Lincoln 's murder , and recast the familiar facts with startling , tabloid immediacy . In the course of his relentless , clock's-tick chronicle of the crucial hours , Jim Bishop , once of the New York News and Mirror and now editor of the Catholic Digest , sticks to police-blotter facts-and makes the state of the nation 's security on April 14 , 1865 look appalling . <P> Hundreds of Terrorists ? At 10:15 p.m. , as the Lincolns sat watching Our American Cousin at Ford 's Theatre , John Wilkes Booth made his way unnoticed into the presidential box , fired a bullet into the back of the President 's head , and escaped across the stage to his horse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John F. Parker , of the Washington police force , was drinking at a bar next door ; he had deserted his post at the door to the presidential box , through which the assassin passed . Who was Parker ? A questionable type with black marks on his police-force record ( all kept from Lincoln ) . There was an uproar from the theater and a terrible cry that the President had been shot , but Parker was not heard from until 6 the next morning , when he turned in a streetwalker to show that he had not been idle . Never punished , Parker served three more years on the force before he was fired for sleeping on duty . <P> <P> While Booth galloped over the Navy Yard bridge into southern Maryland , official Washington collapsed in " inert panic . " Instead of directing pursuit of the assassin , the capital 's police chief , who was in the audience and saw him , rushed off to tell his detectives to gather witnesses . Four soldiers bore the mortally wounded President to a tailor 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stabbed Secretary of State Seward , bedridden by a recent accident . Washington 's army commandant , General Christopher C. Augur , sent patrols out helter-skelter and waited for orders from his chief , Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton . With another Cabinet member , Stanton hurried from the bedside of Seward to the tailor 's house and set up a frantic headquarters there . While the President lay bleeding in a hall bedroom and Mrs. Lincoln screamed and wept in the front parlor , Stanton " convened a special court of inquiry . . . issued orders , wrote messages . . . summoned high personages . . . and took the reins of government . " <P> Sure that " hundreds of terrorists were in Washington City , " he ordered all firemen on the alert against possible mass arson . Without bothering about legal authority , he ordered the arrest of " every human being " employed at Ford 's Theatre . <P> He ordered out 8,000 soldiers and dispatched patrols in every direction except the one which Booth took ( Stanton erroneously assumed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still enforced ) . The telegraph went dead . Army units searched and arrested blindly.
