" It 's kinda funny when Ah say ' Perish on mah sword , ' " mused a Colt-toting Texas lad , and it may be even funnier than he supposed . This week he and 27 other Texas students are due in London with what is likely to be the oddest U.S. export to Britain this year-an " adult western " version of Shakespeare 's Midsummer Night 's Dream , produced by Howard Payne College ( enrollment : 1,100 ) , a Baptist school in Brownwood , west of Waco . <P> Just as unlikely is the Dream 's creator : a trim , urbane Englishman named Alex Reeve , 58 , who turned up at Howard Payne more than two years ago as speech professor , after 14 years as a director at the Royal Theater and Opera House in Northampton , England .

To pay their way , the players kicked in their savings , worked at all sorts of odd jobs , raised $10,000 on their own . Friends , teachers , fellow students boosted the ante to $17,000 . Result : the Howard Payne Dream will be sole U.S. representative at Bristol 's prestigious International Festival of University Theater , and for nine weeks will get top billing at professional theaters in Coventry , Northampton , Cambridge , and Dundee , Scotland . If this is the way to meet up with ole Shakespeare , the students say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
