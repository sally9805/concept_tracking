txt A Congressional tax expert warned yesterday that thel Federal Government faced the prospect of a budget deficit this year even without the expanded defense program Presi-1 dent Eisenhower has proposed . Representative Wilbur D. Mills , Democrat of Arkansas , said that the newest Congressional estimates indicated total tax receipts for the fiscal year 1958 , which began July 1 , would be $1,300,000,000 less than the Budget Bureau estimated two months ago . Instead of a $1,500,000,000 surplus that the bureau had predicted , Mr. Mills said that there might well be no surplus at all and that definite prospect of a deficit existed . He warned that inflation coupled with defense requirements to meet Soviet scientific advances precluded hope of tax cuts " for quite some time to come . " Deficit Spending Foreseen Another speaker from Washington , Robert B. Anderson , Secretary of the Treasury , indicated here last night that the Soviet satellite achievements might force the Federal Government into deficit spending . Addressing a dinner of the Advertising Council at the Billpore Hotel , he declared , however , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced budget . Mr. Anderson made it clear that he would not attempt to prevent deficit spending at the expense of defense . He indicated that the Administration might ask Congress in 1958 to raise the $275,000,000,000 debt limit . Representative Mills is a ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee , which initiates tax legislation . He spoke at the conference of // the Tax Foundation , Inc. , a private research organization , at the Plaza Hotel . " If Federal expenditures increase at a faster rate than the expansion of the nation 's economic capacity , we will face higher tax rates , tighter money , or inflation , or some combination of the three , " he said . While Mr. Mills declined to predict the ultimate eventuality , it was learned that some Can- ' gressio:aal fiscal authorities:1347 , lieve further inflation is inevi= , table and might result in as much as a further 25 per cent increase in prices . Mr. Mills said the new fiscal forecast represented informal estimates of receipts made by the staff of the Joint Committee on Internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its midyear review released last Oct. 1 estimated total receipts of $73 , - 500,000,000 , total expenditures of $72,000,000,000 and a surplus of $1,500,000,000 . The committee staff 's new estimate was for receipts totaling $72,200,000,000 . Mr. Mills declared that while " substantial savings " could be made and some of the fiscal problem eased by cuts in nondefense spending , he did not think they would be " adequate to offset rising defense costs . " If real savings are to be made , he said , President Eisenhower " must be willing to share responsibility " for revising " the substance of spending programs ' ? and show how and where revisions can be made instead of merely inviting Congress , as he did at the last ses- ' sion , to feel free to cut spending . Mr. Mills said that the ultimate determinant of tax reduction was the rate of expansion of the nation 's productive capacity and that tax , revision ' could speed it . He said that revision , of tax laws to close loopholes and eliminate inequities would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would conduct , starting Jan. 7 in Washington . Roswell Magill , president of . the Tax Foundation , told the morning session of the two-day ' conference that the present tax system " is barely adequate to our needs today . " He called for simplification of the law and a reduction of " existing steep rates of income taxes . " He said that experience has proved that the high rates " do not produce much revenue " and that the lower ones did . Gordon Grand Jr. , vice . president of Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation , cited recent surveys showing that rates on the highest income tax brackets since World War II " produced very little more revenue than the low rates of the Nineteen Twenties . " Senator John L. McClellan , Democrat of Arkansas , will speak at the Foundation 's annual dinner tonight and receive its annual award for distinguished public service . About 190 persons attended yesterday 's session . BUDGET GOALS ASSESSED Treasury Chief Says Defense Needs May Lead to Deficit Secretary of the Treasury Robert B. Anderson indicated last night that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit spending . Mr. Anderson said , however , that the Government " must do everything we can " to maintain the balanced budget . But he made it clear that he would riot attempt to keep the Government from deficit spending at the expense of defense . In a speech at the annual dinner of the Advertising Council at the Biltmore Hotel , Mr. Anderson said that the Administration must be guided by " sensible flexibility " and " disciplined reason " rather than " absolute rigidity " in setting budget goals . The dinner was a testimonial to Sidney J , Weinberg , senior partner of the investment banking concern of Goldman , Sachs &; Co. and former ' assistant chief of the War Production Board . Mr. Weinberg received the council 's annual award fort public service . Mr. Anderson commented on the fiscal problem posed by the expanded defense program proposed by President Eisenhower .

" Maintaining a balanced budget in this country is Of great importance to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So also is keeping our expenditures within reasonable and prudent limits .

" We must try to fathom  --  the future needs of our country ; , we must try to anticipate the course of our economy and try to be practical and objective in the multitude of judgments that all of us have to make . " Mi . Anderson conceded that some segments of the nation 's economy were " going through a period of readjustment : " ? But he said that the nation had made similar readjustments before " without serious impact on our economy , " and he voiced confidence that this country has " the basic ingredients for a healthy and growing economy .

" Cannon Sees Reallocations WASHINGTON , Dec. 2 ( P ) Representative Clarence Cannon , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , said today much of the additional funds needed for Air Force , research and guided missile programs might be , obtained through reallocations . He said he doubted that a lot more money would be needed for the over-all defense program , but that what might be needed was a reallocation of funds within the total program . The next war , if one comes , may be won or lost in the air in a few hours with long range bombers and missiles , he . said .
