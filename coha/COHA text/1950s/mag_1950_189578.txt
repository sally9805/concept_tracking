Clement Attlee 's Labor government last week faced its hardest important parliamentary test and every M.P . who could walk was in the House of Commons . Latecomers stood toe to heel in the back of the chamber . On Labor 's front bench , little Clem Attlee , more inconspicuous than ever , was squeezed in between Deputy Prime Minister Herbert Morrison and Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Stafford Cripps . <P> The Laborites were plainly worried . The nine Liberals had decided to vote with the Tories against the government 's proposal for a ninepence a gallon increase in the gasoline tax . Illness had reduced the slim Labor majority to the vanishing point . <P> When the bewigged House clerk intoned : " First resolution : hydrocarbon oils ( rate of customs duty and rebate ) , " the Tories , who did not recognize this as a reference to the gasoline tax , were caught napping . The Speaker put the resolution to a voice vote , and the Laborites responded with a loud " aye . " The Tories remained silent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker . A roar of triumphant laughter burst from the Laborite benches . But the Laborites laughed too soon . Winston Churchill sat up sharply and whispered to Tory Whip Patrick Buchan-Hepburn . When the Speaker repeated the question Churchill and Buchan-Hepburn raised a loud Tory " no , " and the Speaker called for a division of the House . The result : Aye , 304 ; No , 299 . From the Labor benches came an audible sigh of relief . <P> Meanwhile , in a by-election in the constituency of West Dumbartonshire , Laborite Torn Steele had defeated Tory Robert Allan by a majority of only 293 to boost the government 's overall parliamentary majority to seven . The Socialists got what temporary comfort they could from this , but the Tories did not leave them in peace for long . This week the government squeezed through by 279 to 278 in a division on the Transport Ministry appropriation.
