that he sat alone . When he had finished his coffee and paid his bill , he donned his light paletot ( for the air had turned quite chilly ) and set out for a walk , hoping that something would happen to relieve his tedium , even that his purposeless footsteps might lead him into an adventure . Instinctively he turned eastward , for he loved the City when the turmoilof the day was over and the streets had been left to darkness and solitude . It surprised him to find that the streets were not deserted at all . On second thoughts , however , the reason for this was quite clear . London was hungry and discontented . The depression which had been predicted at the end of the war had come belatedly , and because of that with greater violence . Factories and businesses had been closing down and a large part of the male population had no work . People were starving , the poorhouses were filled to overflowing with the indigent , the prisons were crowded with petty thieves who would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry , they do not sit around at home , if they have homes ; they congregate instead in the streets and loudly voice their disaffection , and sometimes they make things uncomfortable for any well-dressed and wellfedpeople who venture among them . This was what was now happening , Julian perceived , when his strolling feet brought him within sight of an establishment which was well lighted in spite of the hour . A party of young men of obviously high social rank ( they all had beaver hats and they wore handsome blue coats over white waistcoats ) seemed to be acting as a mounted escort for two ladies . They were riding slowly and laughing in loud voices , having dined well . The sound of their horses ' hoofs on the cobbled street , combined with their high-pitched levity , had brought out crowds of the unemployed to jeer at them as they passed . Julian was both startled and alarmed to discover that the first of the two ladies , who rode in the van between two highly exhila rated young bucks , was none other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the illuminated house and Isabelle 's two immediate escorts sprang from their saddles to help her alight . She yielded herself to their upturned arms with some hesitation , for in their desire to do something different they had come from a formal dinner party and she was dressed in white satin with figured gauze draped over it . The necklace she was wearing was much too valuable to be flaunted openly in dark streets , and the same could be said for the pearl-decorated lace wrap she had thrown over her white shoulders . " You will all stay here except Lady Betsy , " announced Isabelle , when her delicately shod feet were safe on the pavement . " I wo n't have any of you hearing what Madame Martine may tell me . It would be all over London by morning if you did . Come along , Betsy , we 'll keep our appointp301ment with Madame . These gallant gentlemen will wait for us here . The fresh air will do them all much good , I 'm sure . " " We 'll count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one of the escorts in a languishing voice . Julian , standing on the opposite side of the road , was alarmed to find that the party of horsemen was now surrounded by men of anything but pacific intent . The onlookers had not yet resorted to any form of interferenceor violence but it was clear enough they would not long accept passively this open demonstration of the wealth and luxury which existed above them . " What is that house across the street ? " Julian asked a man standing beside him who did not seem to belong to the rapidly growing mob . " Oh , that 's where this fortuneteller lives . The one who 's set all society agog , " replied the man . " Her name is Madame Something-or-other and she 's supposed to be absolutely clairvoyant . She tells people all about their pasts and sends them into spasms of amazement and delight with what she predicts of their futures . Her fees are damnably high , I understand . " He then asked a question in turn . " Was it Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady and beautiful enough to be  --  the one you mention , " answeredJulian . " Does it occur to you , sir , that we are likely to witness a riot of sorts in a few minutes ? " " It has occurred to me , " said the other . " And being a law-abiding citizen and the head of a family , I propose to take myself off at once and so avoid having any part in it . " Julian had recognized the young blood with the languishing voice as a fellow student at Clutterhaugh . He crossed the road and laid a hand on the blue-coated shoulder of his onetime friend . " Delane , " he said , " I 've a word of advice for you . Collect your full party at once and get away from here . There will be trouble if you delay about it . " " Oh , it 's you , Grace , " said the other , recognizing him in the light from the windows of the fortuneteller 's establishment . " Odd that you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were you following us by any chance ? " " No , " said Julian shortly . " It 's pure coincidence that I 'm here . I was out for a stroll and I saw you idiots come galloping down on some absurd prank or other . Who ever heard of riding in evening dress ! The only reason I intrude myself on you is that I do n't like the looks of this crowd . They are hungry and they are angry . If I were you , I would get the ladies out at once and escort them home while there 's time . " " I 'm sure , Grace , you have Lady Gardiner 's best interests at heart . " Delanegave a quick glance at the hostile faces staring at them out of thep302darkness and became convinced that quick action was needed . " By gad , you 're right . I do n't like the looks of this at all . Edgar , " addressing the second rider who had been in the van , " I 'm going in and drag her ladyship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task it would be , if I had to use force ! Eh , Grace ? We must get away from here , Edgar . We may be too late as it is . " Julian did not leave . If there was to be trouble , he must play a part in the safeguarding of Isabelle . He saw Isabelle emerge from the front entrance of the house , with Lady Betsy on one side and the partly inebriated Delane on the other . She was protesting at the interruption . " This is absurd , " Julian heard her say . " If you are afraid , Frankie Delane , go on back to the Veseys ' and take your friends with you . Betsy and I are not afraid . " " I am , " said Lady Betsy , taking one apprehensive look at the crowd . The onlookers booed and jeered as the ladies were helped into the saddle . One of them stepped out from the rest and raised his voice above the din . " Do you know who this beauchus creature is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one here in white with diamonts around her neck ? She 's the daughter of Samuel Carboy , the worst bloodsucker of the lot . She 's married to a man what has millions . She 's got four houses and hundreds of servants . That dress she 's got on would keep our wives and childer in food for months . " The mention of the name Carboy brought prolonged groans and hisses from the mob but it also brought a second member to the fore . He stepped out and held up a hand . " Wait a minute , all of you ! " he shouted . " I got something I want to say . You 're all wrong about Carboy . He may be a bloodsucker like the rest . Anybody what feeds and waxes fat off the labors of the poor is a bloodsucker , and that much I give you . But I want to call to your attention that not one of the Carboy factories has closed down . He has n't chucked out a single worker . He has n't been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of them . He 's been working up trade in the U-nited States and now he 's selling the goods he makes to them . " The speaker looked about him belligerently , as though daring the others to disagree . " The time will come  --  and , oh , may it come soon , my friends and brothers  --  when there wo n't be any Carboys to skim off the cream . But until that time comes , I want to tell you this : I 'd rather have one Carboy today than all the rest of them sewed up together  --  all the Smiths and the Jenkinses , and the Warrings and the Betgers . If they followed the example of Samuel Carboy , there would n't be none of us out of work today . And make no mistake about that . "  |p303The  crowd seemed to have become more interested in the discussion than in the well-dressed interlopers . It was the right moment to leave . Julian caught Delane 's eye and motioned to him frantically . The latter nodded and wheeled his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a hasty scatteration and a lane opened for the horses . " Out of the way , gutter-lappers ! " shouted Delane , his courage coming back . But his confidence seemed likely to prove premature . One of the crowd , carried away by the sight of Isabelle 's jewelry , dashed out unexpectedly and sprang on the neck of her horse , reaching with one hand for the necklace . The horse rose on its hind legs in fright , and the would-be thief would have been thrown off without more ado , but Isabelle was leaving nothing to chance . Julian , plunging through the ring of watchers , saw her double up her arm and drive her elbow into the midriff of her assailant . He gave up his hold immediately and , gasping for breath , dropped to the muddy cobbled road . A second mobster had better luck . He had followed his fellow 's exampleand had sprung at the neck of Lady Betsy 's horse . When he was dislodged he kept in his grasp the rich cloth pelerine she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm , he plunged into the crowd and was lost sight of at once . When the sound of galloping hoofs was no longer heard , Julian resumed his walk , swinging his cane reflectively as he went . The streets grew darker and more silent . After a half hour of purposeless pacing he realized that he had no idea where he was . " I 'll ask for directions at the first light I see , " he said to himself . It was a long time before he saw the desired light but this did not matter at all . His mind was so busy that he did not care how far afield he might wander . What the second speaker from the mob had said had made a deep impression on him . " It was true , " he thought . " Samuel Carboy always knows the right thing to do . He never seems to make mistakes . I knew he had n't closed down anv of his factories but it had never occurred to me that this was important . 1 can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If all the heads of business were like him , the country would n't be in the state it is . " He was finding it hard to make these admissions . Nevertheless , he went a step fur-1 her . " I wish Father would stop digging at him in the House . People are beginning to laugh about it and say it 's spite . Nothing came of all the pother in the House about the Tontine . In fact it turned out to be a feather i n their caps . "  |p304Then  he came to a full stop . All this time he had been turning over in his mind the things he had heard . Not once had he given a thought to Isabelle , although this was the first glimpse he had had of her since the wedding . Although the encounter had left him with plenty of room for speculation about his lost love , although he had seen her prove her presence of mind when attacked , he had allowed her to go completely out of his mind . Had her beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the poorer classes of London were thinking ? He remained still for several more moments , standing at a street corner and making no move to cross . " Can it be , " he asked himself , " that I am getting over it ? Am I actually cured ? Is it possible that I 'm like everyone else after all ? I was certain I would carry Isabelle 's image in my heart as long as I lived and never be able to forget her or put anyone in her place . Is it even possible that I may fall in love again sometime ? " He became aware that a light showed in an upper window of a building on the opposite corner . He crossed the street. 3There was a sign over the door and the light from the window above enabled Julian to make out the lettering . It read : A. BRINKERJamaica MerchantHe gasped with surprise . " Can it be the Ambrose Brinker I know ? " he asked himself . It must be , he decided . It would be straining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the same name in one thinly populated island . He gave a thump with the door knocker and almost immediately a figure appeared at the window above , cutting off most of the light . " Who is it ? " " Are you Ambrose Brinker from Kingston ? " " Yes . " There was a moment 's silence and then the voice became eager . " I do n't think I can be mistaken . Is it you , Grace ? " " It is . What a stroke of luck that I should choose this street blindly ! Come down and let me in , man ! " It seemed a matter of seconds only until the door opened . Brinker , holding a candle over his head and looking in the dim light somewhat thinner and more gaunt about the eyes , stared out at the visitor.  | " My dear fellow , my very dear fellow ! What a splendid surprise . Come in , come in . " The downstairs rooms were all devoted to business and there was the same cool odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to a little counting office at the rear and ensconced his caller in a chair of considerable depth and corresponding comfort . " I have n't Dunder with me but I can do almost as well myself . What is it to be ? One of our special punches ? " " By all means . I 've never encountered anything to equal them . " Brinker talked while he got out the ingredients and proceeded to mix them . It was with a deep sigh that he handed a glass to Julian . " Poor Forster ! I had your letter and it almost finished me . You will tell me all about it . But not now  --  not now ! We must n't mar our reunion with such sad memories . Particularly as there are depressing things I must tell you . " The animation which had shown in his eyes when he greeted his visitor at the door had vanished . he sat without moving for several moments . In the rather dim light of the candles Julian could see that his cheeks were thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a highly nervous state , his face twitching , his long frame never still in the chair . " My father is dead , " said Brinker finally . " I sold the plantations at once  --  for reasons which I 'll tell you later  --  and came here to London . He had n't been in good health for quite a time but his end was very sudden . He toppled off his horse in the cane fields and was dead when the overseer reached him . " Julian expressed his regrets over this unfortunate occurrence . Then , thinking to take his host 's mind into more pleasant fields , he asked Brinker how he liked life in London . Brinker gave his head a shake . " I was n't born for this sort of thing , " he said . " I 'm used to the soft air of Jamaica . All this rain and wind and rawness , not to mention the fogs , will be the death of me . I swear to you , Grace , that the poorest slave in the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see on the streets of London . And f augh ! The smells ! Of course the life here is strangely stimulating . This business , which I 've just started , is going very well . I may find it in time more profitable than the plantations . But all in all it required an extraordinary reason to make me sell my island holdings . " He remained silent for a time and Julian did not speak , realizing that he must wait on his companion 's moods . " Did you know , " asked Brinker finally , " that Constance Ballard is dead ? "  |p306Julian  cried out in sharp disbelief : " No ! You ca n't mean it ! Brinker , it ca n't be , it ca n't be ! She was so beautiful and gentle and fine . " " She 's gone , poor child , " said the other somberly . " She never recovered from the blow . She began to languish from the day your letter arrived and in a month she was like a shadow . It was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The visitor had forgotten his glass , which rested untouched on the table . He regarded his host with unhappy eyes . " They did n't send me word , " he said . " Do you suppose that down in their hearts they resented me ? That they could n't forgive me for returning safely ? I assure you , Brinker , the bullet which killed poor Cymric could have picked me off just as easily . We were not five feet apart when he went down . " " No , no , banish the thought . They have nothing but the deepest affection for you . I think , perhaps , they put off the writing , dreading the task , and let it go so long that they never did write . I 'm sure that was it . " " She must have loved Cymric very much . " Brinker nodded slowly . " It was consumption which took her in the end . She seemed to get more beautiful all the time . I saw her a week before it happened and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started to weaken and waver and she was sure he was alive and all her talk was of when he would return . She had her couch carried out on a porch where she could see the water ; and there she lay , hour after hour , day after day , never taking her eyes from the horizon . She used to say , He will come tomorrow . I 've seen the ship and it is sailing very fast because the captain knows he must bring my dear Cymric to me quickly . ' At night she slept in the same place and they always built a bonfire close at hand , so that he would have no difficulty if he arrived in the dark . " Brinker 's voice fell to a lower pitch . " Mrs. Ballard is taking it very hard . Near the end the poor child knew she was going and she talked about it freely with her mother . She took messages with her for all the little Ballards who had gone before . " " The small sister is well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brinker looked up with a revived air of interest , even of good-humored slyness . " The small sister ? Yes , the small sister is well . But , of course , no longer small . The years which have elapsed since you saw her have been good to Winifred . I hope you will see her sometime . " " Yes , I hope so , " said Julian in a casual tone . " I seem to remember her as a bright child . I liked her . I liked them all . " They talked then about Julian himself and what he had been doing since his return from the Americas . He spoke of his disappointment and of Ise/belle 's marriage . When he mentioned who she now was , Brinker 's eyes opened wide . " Lady Gardiner ! " he exclaimed . " So she is your Isabelle . I 've been reading and hearing about her . What a swath she 's cutting at court  --  and elsewhere . " " Ambrose , " said Julian gravely , " I 've mourned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what a self-pitying , gloomy fellow I 've been . Why , I 've been a complete misanthrope ! But something happened tonight . I saw her , and suddenly I realized that she was n't very important after all . I did n't come away thinking of her . My mind was filled with other matters . " " My dear Julian ! " cried Brinker . " I 'm delighted to hear this . I 've been so engrossed in getting my business started that I 've made no effort to track you down . But I 've thought of you a very great deal . I wondered how things were turning out . " Julian reached for his glass and took a long pull at its contents . " Capital ! " he said with relish . " The first drink I 've enjoyed since Isabelle told me she was going to marry her damned Tibby instead of me . I assure you , Ambrose , that food has been ashes in my mouth and that drink has tasted like hem-lock . " " This really calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His spirits had been rising as quickly as Julian 's but at this point he stopped . The look of gloom came back to take full possession of his face . " Julian , " he said , " I must tell you the rest of my sad story . She is here  --  in London . But she refuses to see me . She does n't answer my letters . " " She ? Do you mean , by any chance , Mademoiselle Philline ? " Brinker nodded . " Yes , my beautiful will-o ' - the- wisp is here . When we got her safely off the island , she went to the United States and lived for a time in Boston . I arranged for Boston newspapers to be sent me regularly , hoping I could keep myself in touch that way . It was through the papers that I learned she had attached herself to people who sought to abolish slavery in that country . She began to address meetings and the people of Boston were astonished at the fiery speeches made by this young and beautiful woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I had a letter from her . It was short and to the point . She was leaving the United States . She had been advised to leave in order to avoid trouble . So she came here , after sending me a very brief note . I followed as soon as I could get my business affairs straightened out . " " What is she doing here ? " Ambrose motioned in the direction from which his visitor had come . " Did you pass a house on your walk which is being run by a palmist ? It 's Always lighted up nights . They do an active business in the evenings . " " I passed the place . It 's run by a Frenchwoman , I believe . "  | " Madame Martine . She must be very clever because everyone in London is running to see her . I 've heard that even the Duke of Wellington has paid her a call . " Ambrose paused and gave his friend a nod which suggested his inability to understand what he now intended to tell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What a coincidence that I should find out about both of you in one night ! Why do you suppose she has gone in for telling fortunes ? " " I discovered who she was by putting together little bits of information I heard . When I called at the house she sent out a note saying that she was afraid I would disapprove of what she was doing and that it would be better if we did n't meet . All the people about the place had some share of colored blood . Because of that , I came to the conclusion that she was raisingmoney for the cause . " " Have you been back since ? " Ambrose Brinker gave his head a despondent shake . " A dozen times . The answer is always the same . She can not see me . I write her letters and she does n't reply . Perhaps the people she 's with have decided it 's unwise to let us meet and do n't let her know when I call . Or it may be that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Whichever it is , I encountera cold and hostile silence when I go to the house . " There was an interruption at this point . A colored woman of mature years and some massive remains of good looks came into the room . She paused and shook an accusing forefinger at Brinker . " M's'r Am ' ! " she said . " Yu fo'git what I tole yu . Win'ow up . " " But it 's close tonight , " protested her master . " How often yu hear me say , Night come in win'ow , corpse go out door ' ? " " It 's so warm , Frass , that we must have fresh air . " Sassafrassa , to give her the full name her parents had coined , walked scornfully to the window and closed it down tight . " Night air got bref o ' ghosts on it . It got ills and trubbles fum graveya'ds on it . Night air , h'it no good , M's'r Am ' . " " Well , " said her master , winking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do without fresh air , Frass , you will at least get us some food . " " No ! No food . Too much food no good fo ' young stummicks . No mm ' eating tonight , M's'r Am ' . " " I 'm not hungry , I assure you , " said Julian to his host . " I had a late dinner and a hearty one . " " Then let 's do this . We 'll celebrate our reunion with a really fine supper some evening soon . " He added in a low tone , " I inherited this old termagant from my father . But she is a wonderful cook  --  when she 's in the mood . Illp309guarantee , Julian , that she 'll be in the mood when you come and you 'll have a supper which will quite transport you . " The cook was watching him with suspicion in every line of her countenance . Her hands were on her hips . " Wha ' dat yu say , M's'r Am ' ? " " I 'm inviting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sassafrassa put her foot down , quite literally . " No ! No sup ' Tues 'd . Weds 'd , yes . " " Wednesday ? " asked Brinker , smiling at Julian . " Wednesday will be fine . I 'll be glad to have supper with you . But now , Ambrose , I must be getting back to Spring Gardens . " Ambrose got to his feet . " I 'll walk along with you , " he said . " I 'll go just far enough to catch a glimpse of the lights from her windows before turning back . You would laugh at me if you knew how often I do that . " Julian dressed himself with particular care on the evening when he was to have supper with Ambrose Brinker . He avoided the excesses of the macaronis , however  --  the young bloods who disregarded the dictates of Beau Brummell and adorned themselves in all the colors of the rainbow  --  and wore a dark blue coat with very large silver buttons , a waistcoat of subdued fawn , and trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sides just above the ankle . He donned a tall beaver hat and , as his toilet had taken longer than he intended , took possession of a hackney cab . Brinker was a little taken back by his elegance . " By gad , Julian , you put me right in the shade ! " he complained . He was wearing a dark coat , it was true , but his stock was blue and his waistcoat a ripe lemon yellow ; and , moreover , he wore breeches which were rather baggy at the knees and his stockings were not of silk . The host led the way to a small room overlooking the street in which he kept his books and a few fine pieces of furniture which he had brought with him from the island . Julian 's eyes took special note of a bookholder which was pyramidical in shape and which swung , rather creakily , on a roundp310upright support . He noticed that the top shelf , where the space was quite cramped , had false book backs of leather . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking cautiously first in the direction of the door . " She always kept my father on a pretty tight bradoon . She had been handsome in her day , so I was told , and he  --  well , he gave in to all her whims . Besides , she was the only cook he ever had who could make the tough meats of the island palatable . When I got my hands on things it was too late to do anything about Frass . She was the boss around the place , . To keep the peace , I gave in to her . " She met her match once , " he went on , with a smile of pleased recollection . " That was when Mademoiselle was with us . Frass took one look at her and came right down off her high horse . She put off her airs and it was ' Yes , Missy , ' the whole time . . . . Ah , Julian , how I long to see her again ! " " I can believe what you say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've been enjoying the most wonderful odors ever since I arrived . " " That 's the hot bread . Yes , my good friend , it will be a fine supper . She 'll have surprises for you . There 's a white fish with a wine sauce , and cold mutton , and such hot bread , and such a pudding made of corn flour with plums and nazeberry jam , and all sprinkled over with white sugar and served with an orange sauce ! Wait until you taste that ! " " Are we to sit down alone ? " Brinker shook his head and motioned toward the window , which was admitting the sound of carriage wheels and the shrill comments of curious neighbors . " Here they are now . Come and look out , Julian . Does that make you think of Jamaica ? " What Julian saw from the window was a glorified kittereen , with a fringed top instead of an umbrella and a colored man in a blue uniform driving with a fine flourish of the reins . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his roving eye stirred immediate recollections . " Ambrose ! " he cried . " I believe that 's Noel . " " I believe it is , " affirmed Ambrose , smiling . Then he added , " We must go down and welcome the ladies . " Julian was so delighted and puzzled at this unexpected encounter with the jovial servant who had done so much for his comfort in Jamaica that the allowed his host to welcome the two ladies who stepped down from the back seat of the kittereen while he spoke to Noel . " You rascal ! " he said . " How does it happen that you 're here in London ? Whatever the reason , I 'm glad to see you . " " Yes , I'se N'le , m's'r . You goin ' see plenty me , I guesses. "  |p311Julian  turned and waited to be introduced to the ladies . One was a gentlewomanin slightly reduced circumstances with a pinched nose and an air of authority , which stamped her in his mind as a teacher in a private school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion was young and fashionably dressed . " Miss Alberta Hoxie , " said Brinker , " this is Mr. Julian Grace . " The reduced gentlewoman inclined her head with the brevity and suspicionwhich constant chaperoning imposes on those of her kind . Julian bowed and said , " I am honored , ma'am . " " And this is someone you already know , " went on Brinker . " I do n't believeMiss Bordley would have allowed us the pleasure of Miss Hoxie 's company and that of her charge if I had not been able to tell her that you had been a guest of Miss Ballard 's parents in Jamaica . " Julian turned quickly to the girl who stood beside the teacher . She was slim and dark , with the cool beauty which comes from straight and simply dressed black hair and a skin as white as magnolia blossom . She was wearing a tiny leghorn hat and a long olive-green pelisse which allowed no further glimpses of her save of her small hands in Parma-violet gloves under puckeredsleeves and the tip of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mama would have given me messages for you , Mr. Grace , if they had known I would see you in London , " said the girl , in a slightly throaty voice . Julian was recovering his wits with difficulty . " You are Miss Winifred , of course , " he said . " Who else could you be ? And yet  --  and yet --  " " Small girls do grow up , Mr. Grace , " said Winifred with the most vagrantof smiles , and a coolness and poise which did credit to the training she had received at the fashionable establishment of Miss Gertrude Jane Bordley . " Yes , of course , " declared Julian , more at his ease . " I seem to remember an occasion when I had to convince you that this was what would happen to you . And at the same time I made a prophecy which I now realize was absurdly limited in its scope , and , in fact , most embarrassingly inadequate in every way . " The girl looked at him from under raised eyelashes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me what it was . " The arrival of such an unusual vehicle was creating something approaching a sensation in the neighborhood . People had come out from the houses and were lounging on doorsteps , not making any effort to lower the voices in which they expressed their opinions . Boys were hammering at the spokes of the wheels with sticks and were shouting at Noel : " Hi , black fella ! Ye think ye 're pretty botty , do n't ye ? "  |p312Ambrose  Brinker escorted the ladies inside and Julian followed , after waving to Noel . The latter had brought out a whip of red leather and was preparing to depart . Brinker led the way up the dark stairs , with the ladies following and Julian bringing up the rear . The latter was feeling a sense of disappointment . When he had stayed at the Ballard plantation and Winifred had been a small girl , they had been the best of friends ; but now she treated him with polite aloofness . How lovely she had become ! What a miracle , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminous and yet so intelligent . How slender and graceful she was ! When they reached the sitting room on the floor above , he had already come to a momentous conclusion . " It was all worked out by the fates , " he thought . " It was ordained that I should empty my mind of Isabelle so there would be room for this lovely lady that little Winifred Ballard has grown into . " Despite the high expectations which had been raised in his mind about the supper , Julian barely knew what he was eating . He went through the meal in a dazed condition ; but all the time he was acutely conscious of Winifred , who sat opposite him at the table . He was only faintly aware that the fish was delicate and the sauce superb but he knew every detail of her dress . There was in him the merest appreciation of the glory of the pudding but he was sure that her eyes , which had seemed black in the street , had become like the midnight blue of sapphires under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the topics of conversation which were introduced but it was evident at the time that he was bearing some share in the talk . At any rate the rest looked at him at intervals , and smiled or shook their heads before chiming in with thoughts of their own . It was an automatic function he was performing . He found that she was called Freddie at school . Apparently she had refused to respond to Winnie , holding that it sounded soft and sentimental . It seemed to Julian that the new name suited her . He turned it over in his mind and reached the conclusion that he liked it . He learned also that the kittereen had been made in London on specifications that her father sent before he allowed his daughter to come over to complete her education . It had been in Timothy Ballard 's mind that she would find the life at school too confining . It was maintained in the neighborhood of the school and thep313other girls fought for invitations to accompany her in it . Noel had been acquired through some curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her driver , Mr. Ballard having no faith in the ability of London coachmen . Julian thought : " There 's something curious about this . When I have a chance I must ask about it . " His feelings were achieving a sentimental maturity with dizzying speed . Never in all his years of devotion to the bewitching Isabelle had he been carried along on the crest of a positive flood tide of emotion as he was now . Little Freddie --  But Freddie was not small . She was , as he realized on more careful consideration , rather tall for a girl of her age and it was only her slenderness which made it possible to consider her small . The memory of Isabelle had left him just in time to admit someone else ; and this girl from the golden isle had moved in and settled right down , and he knew that he would never allow as much as an inch to anyone else . When coffee was being served in small stone mugs with cane handles , Julian recovered sufficiently to indulge in normal thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had been trapped a few days before by Mrs. Pardon . " Mr. Grace , it 's a pity you take such little interest in the "  --  Mrs. Pardon had paused and smiled at him archly  --  " shall we say , in the fair sex ? I 've heard of a great chance for you . Oh , a very great chance indeed . " " How much a year does she have ? " he had asked . " Mister Grace ! I 'm not talking about a girl . You must find the right one for yourself . I meant that I know of something very interesting , if you had the girl . It 's this , Mr. Grace . Santa Cruz is going to be vacated . " " Do you mean that neat little house at the end of the block which has no name on it ? " " Yes , Mr. Grace . It 's really a dear little house . The gardens are nice , and the fireplaces all draw , and the dining room has the nicest cupboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She raised an admonishing finger . " You must take advantage of it . Find the girl , Mr. Grace , and I 'm sure Santa Cruz will be yours . You see , it 's named after a victory which is kind of looked down on because it was won in Cromwell 's time  --  and nothing good must ever be said about that dreadful person . No one wants to have the house on that account . Do you feel very hard about Cromwell , Mr. Grace ? " " No . I do n't . " " Then you ought to get married and take Santa Cruz . It was a little the same way when Mr. Pardon proposed to me . It was over twenty years ago and he was sitting at the same desk where he sits today , although at that time he had only worn out four or five --  Well , we 'll not go into that . He came to me and said , My dear , if you 'll say " Yes , " I rather think I can getp314Sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paintings on the walls but I was sure Mr. Pardon would be moving up and up and up and that someday we might be able to ask for , and get , one of the very best . It never occurred to me I would have to get along on so'very little . And so I said , Yes , ' and here we 've been ever since , looking at the beheading of that terrible Eustace at every meal and me spending all my evenings patching the seats of trousers . " " I 'm not sure I like the moral to be drawn from this , Mrs. Pardon . If I find a girl who 's willing to have me and they let me have Santa Cruz , will I sit at one desk for the rest of my life ? And will my poor wife have to mend the seats of innumerable pairs of trousers ? " He began to think of this conversation as he sat opposite Winifred Ballard at the well supper table  --  and to associate her in his mind with Santa Cruz at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see her , wearing a jolly pinafore , in the dining room with the nicest cupboards , or kneeling in the garden with a pruner in one hand and rose scissors in the other . It would be wonderful to share such a trim house , even if it was associated with Oliver Cromwell . He was half disposed , in any case , to admire Old Noll , although this wrongheadedness was confined to the thinkingwhich went on at the very back of his head . At ten o'clock they heard carriage wheels approaching and then the voice of Noel saying : " Whoa dah , Pitt ! Whoa dab , Walpull ! " Miss Hoxie promptly began to draw on her pattens ( they were strictly unnecessary because it was as dry as a bone outside ) . This much accomplished , she began to make motions to her pupil which meant , " Find your bonnet at once , my child . " Both young men accompanied the ladies to the street . Julian had no expectation of a relenting from the strictly correct attitude that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriage at once and he would be left with no more rewarding memory than a vision of the fringe of the kittereen swinging back and forth above the back of a neat leghorn hat . But things turned out rather better . Miss Hoxie got in first and then Freddie turned and held out a gloved hand to him . What was more she smiled , a warm and almost intimate smile . " It 's been so nice to see you again , " she said in a voice very little above a whisper . " I 've thought so much about the days when you and Cymric were with us . " " Come , child ! " called the teacher impatiently . " I must see you again , " declared Julian in a discreetly low tone . " Oh yes . You must . " The fringe swayed above the leghorn hat as they drove away but therep315was a difference from what he had expected . The girl had turned her head to smile back at him . Ambrose Brinker had observed everything and he grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddie ! " he said to himself . " Well played indeed ! " " And now , " declared Julian , when the sound of the carriage wheels had died away in the distance , " you will kindly explain how you managed to arrange this wonderful surprise for me . " " Oh , I 've seen the child several times since she came over , " answered Ambrose in a casual tone . " I thought you might like to meet her again . She has grown up , has n't she ? " Words failed Julian . He was incapable of expressing his reactions to what had happened to Miss Winifred Ballard in the process of growing up . Miss Bordley 's School for Young Ladies was a large and severe house in the neighborhood of Berkeley Square , with an oval brass sign swinging above the door and the most discreet of curtains on all the windows . Julian knew it very well . He had , in fact , paid an unauthorized call there when Isabelle was in attendance and had been sent about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he was calling under the proper auspices . A note had been dispatched to Miss Bordley and a reply had been received , authorizing him to call on Thursday at four o'clock . And here he was now , standing rather diffidently on the doorstep , attired in his long blue coat and shoes of the glossiest black leather , and his beaver hat . His mind was in a confused whirl . He was admitted by a neatly dressed maid whose manners , on the most favorable basis , could not be termed better than surface . At any rate she winked at Julian as she stood aside to let him enter . Miss Bordley herself swept into the hall in a positive susurrus of trailing silk to extend a greeting . For , after all , was he not a kinsman of the Duke of Outland ? " I 'm happy to see you , Mr. Grace , " she said in a voice which suggested she was holding in her mouth a collection of pearls , for of course it could not be anything of less value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him and that she was curious enough not to let this chance slip . " Will you pardon me , Mr. Grace , if I take it on myself to congratulate you without putting my reason into words ? You are indeed a lucky young man . She was pretty , I admit , but never have I tried harder to instill into one of myp316pupils the outward semblance of good breeding . Lady Gardiner indeed ! Why she even --  " It was in her mind apparently to tell about Isabelle kicking her on the shins ; but after a moment 's consideration she decided against this disclosure . " Well , I had my troubles with her just as your father had with hers . Dear , dear , I am being most indiscreet and that is exactly what I ca n't afford to be . But that Isabelle Carboy ! ... And now , who is it you are to see on this very fine afternoon ? Oh yes , the Ballard child . Now this is quite different , Mr. Grace , quite different indeed . Winifred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more education than most of them have when they leave . Oh dear , what am I saying ? They all have education when they leave , though how I manage to get it into the heads of some of them is a mystery . In fact I sometimes say it is a miracle . But Winifred Ballard had as much education when she came as any girl will ever need and I could n't help wondering why she came to me at all . Unless she was weary of life so far away from civilization . " " Life in Jamaica is very pleasant , Miss Bordley , " said Julian . " Oh yes . You have been there . Quite . " It was apparent a suspicion was growing in her mind . " Well , I 'm sure you are more anxious to talk to Winifredthan to me . I 'll take you to the east drawing room where , no doubt , she is waiting for you . " Among the more outspoken pupils , and the least susceptible to the efforts of Miss Bordley to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was spoken of as the Mating Lair , because it was here that they always received their callers . When Julian entered the room in the wake of Miss Bordley , they found it filled with small tables , some of which were already occupied by young ladies with very young gentlemen in attendance , many of the latter in military uniforms . He could see that these weekly meetings were chaperoned with an iron rigidity . Not only was Miss Hoxie sitting in the center of the room , where she could see every one of the seventeen tables , and making no more than a polite pretense of reading a book , but there were maids in starched aprons and caps ready to carry around plates with sandwiches and cakes and cups of tea . Julian suspected also that Miss Bordley herself would never be far away and could be depended upon to appear in a trice in her swishing silk skirts if anything out of the ordinary happened . " Ah , Miss Ballard ! " Miss Bordley was shortsighted and she looked about her with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact she was never known to be helpless under any circumstances . " Here I am , Miss Bordley . " Julian felt his heart begin to thump when a slim figure detached itself from a group of girls in the rear , all of whom quite apparently were waitingp317for their respective swains to appear . Winifred walked toward them without any of the confusion so often displayed on such occasions . She was a picture of perfect poise , in fact , as she dropped a curtsy to Miss Bordley and then bowed to him . She spoke in a low and controlled voice . " It 's so nice of you to come , Mr. Grace . " " Now let me see . " Miss Bordley was staring about the room with a pretense of seeing everything . " Do you care where you sit , my child ? " " Oh yes , please , Miss Bordley . Could we have the corner table ? " " Well , now really , Winifred . " The head of the school , quite clearly , was surprised at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's generally reserved for those who have been here longest . However , as you seem to want it very much , and as I am going to be candid enough to say that I do n't disapprove of Mr. Grace as a caller , perhaps you may have it . " The girl 's eyes opened wide with pleasure . " Oh , thank you so much , Miss Bordley , " she said . As she led the way across the room to the almost secluded nook where they would have their tea , she whispered to him , " Oh , what luck ! " The corner table undoubtedly had great advantages for those who occupiedit . From there it was possible to see everyone else in the room while remaining secluded to quite a degree . It also had a disadvantage which was not likely to bother them much . The servants did not reach it as often as some of the other tables while carrying around the sandwiches and cakes . " All the girls will be green with envy , " she said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the envy would be due in a small measure only to their possession of the prized table . She was certain that her caller was one of the tallest and straightest , and most decidedly the handsomest , of all the young gentlemen who had ever come to the Bordley School for Young Ladies on a Thursday afternoon . " Do you like it here ? " he asked . " No , " she whispered back . " The girls do n't come here to learn . They come to be able to say they were at Miss Bordley 's and to make friends . It 's all rather stupid . " She stopped abruptly and her eyes lost their animation . " Do you  --  do you know about my poor Constance ? " He nodded his head . " Yes . Ambrose Brinker told me . " " I have n't recovered from it yet , " said the girl . " I know I never shall . I loved her so much ! " " You 'll get over it in time , Freddie . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry . The name slipped out . I do n't want you to think of me as presuming --  " " I 'm afraid we must stay on a formal basis when others are around for a while longer . But  --  we are old friends , are n't we ? Please call me Freddiep318when we 're alone . I 'll love it . And perhaps I 'll get my courage up to call you Julian . " The conversation came to a stop . It was not that the tea was monopolizing their attention ; neither had taken a single sip of the rather weak beverage supplied them nor partaken of a crumb of cake . Julian was studying her with such complete absorption that talk had become impossible . " Do you think , Julian , that you 've looked at me long enough ? " she asked finally . " Everyone in the room is watching us now . And I 'm sure they 're beginning to wonder . " " Not nearly long enough , " he answered , collecting his wits with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the chance to look at you all through life , it still would n't be long enough . " Her cheeks had always seemed white and cool but now he saw for the first time a hint of color in them . " Do you realize what you 've said ? " He was asking himself why certain rules were considered right and proper and always had to be observed at the most important moment in a man 's life . Why should he wait to ask her father for permission to pay his attentions to her when what seemed to him the right moment to tell her of his love had arrived ? " I know I should n't have said what I did . I 'm breaking all the rules . I should speak to your father first . Or write to him , and get his consent . But an exchange of letters with Jamaica is a matter of many weeks and I ca n't wait that long . I 'm sure I would go mad with the suspense . I must tell you that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I saw you step down from the kittereen . I knew then that my fate was sealed . " There had been many proposals made in the east drawing room of Miss Bordley 's School for Young Ladies but it may be accepted as certain that none of the young ladies to whom the question had been popped ( a truly frightful word which seemingly can not be avoided ) had possessed as much beauty and common sense as the girl listening to Julian Grace 's declaration . Her superiority was displayed in her manner of receiving this highest of all compliments . She did not cast her eyes down , she did not blush or simper , she did not utter any of the " Oh , fies " or the " Really , sir 's " which were supposed to denote a proper degree of maidenly modesty . Instead she sat very still and watched him with a direct and earnest glance . " You will have to write to Father , " she said after a long moment of eloquent silence . " And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall write too . You see , I know Father . He needs to be managed rather ! " " Does that mean --  Am I being too hasty and  --  er  --  optimistic in believing that you want him to say yes ? "  | " Julian , " said Freddie , and now she did not look up but kept her eyes on the teacup in front of her , " do you want me to say exactly what is in my mind ? " " Yes . Of course . " His tone suggested that he had suddenly become a prey to almost unbearable anxiety . " Then there is a great deal I must tell you . You see , Julian , we all liked you very much , Papa and Mama and Constance and I. We get the London newspapers , as you must remember  --  very old and out of date when they reach us . But they help us to keep in touch with the world . About a year ago  --  after dear Constance left us  --  we saw the announcement of the marriageof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember that she shook her head and sighed . I was n't sorry . I was glad . I never wanted you to marry her . " There was a moment 's pause while she summoned up the courage to go more deeply into the matter of her own reactions . " I liked you from the first day you came . Do you remember what I said ? I looked at you both very carefully and then I said , ' I think this one , ' meaning you , is a more beautiful young man than the other one . ' Do you remember now ? " " Yes . " Julian was smiling broadly and happily . " I remember also that your mother was rather disturbed at your frankness . " " Well , when Mama had finished reading the long report of the wedding , she gave her head a shake and said , Some lucky girl will get him on the rebound after this . ' I was terrified then , because  --  because I did n't want anyone to get you on the rebound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian , you must n't look at me like that . They are all staring at us now . " " My sweet child , " said Julian tremulously , " I ca n't help looking at you like this . Because I think  --  because I am almost certain you 've given me your answer . " She nodded her head slowly . " Yes . That is my answer . But you must now be perfectly frank with me . Do you love me because I am the lucky one to be here to catch you ? Could it have happened if Isabelle had n't married someone else ? " There was so much of a delirious sense of ownership in the gaze he turned on her that the girl at the next table said to her guest , a young man in the uniform of the Guards with a sandy mustache and no chin worth mentioning : " I know that I 'm going to marry someday but I wonder if anyone will look at me the way he 's looking at the sly young puss from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anything like that , Osbald ? " " It 's now over a year , my darling , " Julian was saying , " since Isabelle 's marriage . A rebound comes much sooner than that . It just happened that Ip320found she had gone right out of my head . I saw her a short time ago and it was almost like seeing a stranger . Even then I did n't say to myself , Now I must find someone else to love . ' I just went back to my normal state of mind . I had no inclination for romance whatever . What wonderful luck it was that you needed a final touch of education and so came here where I could see you and love you a thousand times more than I ever loved Isabelle . " " Oh , Julian , I wanted you to say that ! I 'm so happy ! " She paused before going on . " You are going to find I always try to be honest about everything . Julian , I must be honest now , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to London to get an education . I came to get you . " She began to laugh with a lack of restraint which had a touch of hysteria in it . " There , I have told the truth and I have no shame in doing it . If you do n't believe I could be as designing as that , how do you suppose it came about that I brought Noel with me ? " " I 've wondered . " " Papa was so concerned over me when I insisted on coming to Miss Bordley 's that he thought of all manner of things to insure my comfort and health . He thought I needed a personal servant as well as a maid and it was then I mentioned how well you had thought of Noel . So instead of selectingone of our own slaves , as he had intended , he went to Kingston and bought Noel . I hoped then that  --  that Noel could be your servant and keep you comfortable all your life . " Julian was as completely happy as a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has heard her acknowledge that she loves him but who can not take her at once in his arms for the customary fervent kiss . He looked about him and saw that eyes , avid with curiosity , were still fixed on them from all parts of the room . An embrace was quite out of the question . " There are times , " said Freddie , " when Father thinks he has to be very businesslike . I 'm sure this will be one of them . He 'll want to know all about you . Not about your character . He knows already how fine you are . But about your  --  your prospects . " She was looking quite worried . " Dear Julian , are you very poor ? " " I 'm terribly poor , my darling . " " I think I 'm going to be terribly rich . " " Will this make a great difference in your father 's attitude ? " " Not in the end , " declared the girl . " But he may be very disturbed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be careful and tactful about it , I 'm afraid . " She sighed . " Hoxie has just caught my eye and nodded . That means our time is up . " She looked at the table with a trace of dismay when she sawp321that everything had been left untouched , a mound of sandwiches , several raisin buns , a large wedge of spice cake and a gooseberry tartlet . " You may come to see me again . In a fortnight . " " A fortnight ! " Julian 's tone implied that this was close to eternity . " And after that you may n't come for another month . I never realized before how frightfully strict the rules are . Oh , Julian , what are we going to do ? " It was several days later that Julian accompanied his friend Ambrose Brinker on a call at the fortunetelling establishment . A man with a colored skin stood at the door and in a melodious voice demanded to know their business . " I desire to consult Madame Martine , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many visits the latter had made and a doubtful look came into his eves . " I doan ' know , " he said . " We 's moving . " Ambrose took things in hand on hearing this alarming piece of news . " Moving ! " he said . " Are you taking another place in the city ? " The doorman shook his head . " No , suh . We 's leaving country . " Then he dropped his hand from the handle of the door which he had been holding zealously . " I 's not goan ' so it doan ' mattah . You go in and ask man at desk. , He 's de boss heah . An ' lose no time ' bout it . Dey 's leaving soon . " There was every evidence inside to bear out what the guard had said . Domestics with skins varying from a light cream color to a positive black were hurrying from room to room , their arms filled with linen and clothing . Loud voices could be heard everywhere and a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goods were being crated for removal . A young man with a highly intelligent face , which was white of skin but which might easily arouse doubts , sat at a desk in the reception room . Julian said to him , " I have no appointment but I 'm extremely anxious to see Madame Martine before she gets away . "  |p322The  secretary did not reply at once . His heavy brown eyes were fixed on Ambrose with hostile intentness . " Now see here , this wo n't do , " he said finally . " You do n't ever give up , do you ? Confound it , sir , I 'll tell you for the last time that Madame Martine is not able to see you . And , as we are leaving today , there will be no purpose in coming back . " " Mr. Grace is an acquaintance of Madame Martine 's , " said Ambrose , keeping his temper with difficulty . " He 's very anxious to see her . " The secretary smiled sleekly . " It 's no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should have been convinced by this time that there 's no use at all in coming here . Bringing acquaintances with you will not serve your purpose . I 'm very busy so I 'll say good day  --  and good-by . " " Not so fast , if you please . I insist that you send Mr. Grace 's name in . It 's certain that Madame Martine will want to see him . " Ambrose added in a menacing tone : " You 're quite the gentleman and you 've been educated . But I 'm not deceived about you . In fact I 've taken pains to find out a great deal about you . " He turned to Julian . " His name is Reuban Dupuis and he comes from Barbados . I know a very great deal about him . " The man at the desk scowled . " For the last time I tell you that under no circumstances will she see you . Oblige us by leaving . " Forcing their way in to see Mademoiselle was out of the question so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a feminine voice explode into laughter behind them . Both men wheeled quickly and saw that a maidservant had entered the reception room with a file of papers under one arm and that she was holding her other hand over her mouth . They saw also that the secretary had followed them with noiseless steps and that the maid had laughed because he was aping Ambrose Brinker . No two men could have been more unlike physically but the colored man had successfullyachieved the Jamaican 's gait and the way he carried his head as well as the brooding expression of his eyes . Julian took a quick step backward and caught the man by the collar of his coat . " You are very clever , " he said . " Does your employer know of this gift of yours and the way you use it to make light of her visitors ? It 's time she knew , I think . " " I have no employer , " snarled Dupuis . " I 'll have you know that I do what I like . It 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're lying , you cheat and scoundrel ! " Julian 's anger was thoroughly aroused by this time . " I 'll shake your bones loose if you do n't notify Madame Martine at once that we are here . " A door behind the secretary 's desk opened quietly and a feminine voice asked , " What is going on , Reuban ? " Both men recognized the voice . It wasp323that of Mademoiselle Philline . She stood in the doorway , a slender figure in a dress of golden brown . Her face flushed when she recognized them . " Mr. Grace ! And you , Ambrose . This is indeed a surprise . " Julian crossed the room and shook hands with her , noting that she looked very little different . There was , perhaps , a trace of fatigue in her eyes but they were as large and lustrous as ever . The years , which take away so much of the beauty and charm of women , had been kind to her . " It is a great pleasure to renew our all too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while as though we were to be denied that privilege . " Mademoiselle Philline turned to Ambrose Brinker with an air of contrition . " It may seem to you , my best of friends , " she said , " that I am completelylacking in gratitude . But believe , please , that it is not so . I am fully aware of what I owe you  --  and I am oh , so grateful , dear M'sieur Ambrose . There have been  --  reasons . I can not go into them now . " The face of the Jamaican brightened at this demonstration of her feeling for him . " I have no complaints , my dear child , " he said . " If you will never Forget , when you are in need of a friend , that I exist . That I exist for little else then to help you . " He hesitated and then continued : " Somehow I have been sure that of late you have needed assistance . But you have n't called on me . " While these remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the desk . His face carried an open avowal of the deep resentmenthe was feeling . When Mademoiselle Philline turned toward him and spoke in French , very rapidly and with a softly slurring accent , he frowned and gestured violently to express his dissent . When she was through , he began a bitter harangue , the purpose of which obviously was to bring her back to an acceptance of discipline . He motioned to the visitors to indicate that she must send them away without further words . " No , no ! " she exclaimed . " It will not do . You are wrong , Reuban , and I refuse to do what you want . " She turned then to the two callers . " Will you be kind enough to come with me ? We must have a talk and it will be more comfortable in here . " Reuban Dupuis did not look up as they passed him on their way to the inner room but Julian observed that his fingers had taken hold of a long paper cutter and that his knuckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house had been a residence of some distinction at one time and the room into which they stepped had been used in its palmy days as a salon . The ceiling was high and the stone of the chimney had been elaborately carved by the hand of an artist . The hangings at the window and the French rug on the floor had once contributed to the grandeur of the householdp324but now they were showing the effects of long usage . The curtains were drawn so that the room depended for its illumination on candles in wall sconces ; an effect most useful for the purpose to which the apartment was now devoted . Mademoiselle Philline seated herself behind a table with a handsome new velvet covering . It was completely bare of the usual trappings of the fortunetelling trade . The two men seated themselves in front of her . " I wish to explain , " she said in a low tone of voice , " that I have not been engaged in a money-making scheme . It is true that our venture here has been extremely profitable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I am doing . I have given my clients an honest picture of what they may expectof life . You see , God has placed on the palms of our hands a sure outwardindication of what we have inside us . In our hearts and our minds . To that extent , at least , the palm is a key to the future . " " People have been talking about you all over town , " said Julian with a smile . " I got the impression rather that you are a combination of the Maid of Kent , Mother Shipton and Cassandra . " " Make no mistake , messieurs , " she said earnestly . " We could have continuedhere most profitably . But the proceeds go to spreading the word of the need for freeing slaves all over the world . None of us has profited from the money which poured in . " " Do you feel free to tell us why you are moving ? " asked Ambrose , who had been watching with all his devotion in his eyes . " And where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his direction and gave him for the first time the exclusive attention of her eyes . " It is a matter of going where we can do the most good , " she explained . " Did you read not so long ago of the colored servants who deserted a ship as soon as it touched port and ran with bare feet to the first piece of open ground they could find ? The law that any slave whose feet touch the soil of the British Isles becomes free is not a new one ; but that incident was a reminder that England is already in favor of abolition . We realized suddenly that we are not needed here . Your Mr. Wilberforce and those who worked with him have already guided the opinion of the country . " " Then where are you going ? " asked Ambrose . " It will take many years to free the slaves in the British dominions , " she said . " In the meantime there are brave and devoted people leaving their homes here and going out to help the colored people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see now that it is our duty to help them . " She paused as though reluctant to give him a more specific answer . " Well , you might as well know all about it . I am going back to Jamaica . "  |p325Ambrose  leaned his arms on the table to bring himself closer to her . It was evident that her reply had both startled and dismayed him . " My dear child ! " he exclaimed . " Your feet have touched the soil of England . You are free here . But if you go to Jamaica , wo n't you be in danger of immediate recognition and being sent back to the man who owned you ? " She nodded slowly . " Yes . There is that danger . But I must go . " At this point they heard voices from an adjoining room , many voices , raised in cheerful tones and accompanied by much laughter . The outburst was so sudden that the two visitors looked at her in surprise . " Please , if you will go to that door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suggestion was directed to Ambrose . He got up at once and opened the door into the other room for a few seconds , letting the animated sounds from the company there reach their ears in increased volume . Then he closed the door and returned to his chair . " What did you see ? " " That was once the dining room , I judge , " he answered . " All of your people are at the table and enjoying what seems to me a quite ample lunch . I saw a beefsteak-and-kidney pie , and a dish of boiled potatoes , steaming hot , and a plate of cold beef . When I said they were all there , I should have mentioned that the belligerent young man , whose name I happen to know is Reuban Dupuis , was not with them . I 'm afraid our visit has spoiled his appetite . " Mademoiselle proceeded quietly with an explanation . " We are all equal . I have no privileges that are n't shared by the maids and the porters . We have our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much theirs as mine . But , of course , none of us keep any part of it , except a very small allowance each week . My little Freezia , who sweeps and tidies this room for me and who 's as black as the Queen of Sheba , gets exactly as much as I do . " " And who handles the funds ? " asked Ambrose , although he was sure that he knew the answer . " Reuban Dupuis . This was his plan . He got us together and he found the money to get us started . He considers himself the head  --  and has a right to  --  although he gets the same share as any of us . " " Are you sure of that ? " She responded with an earnest shake of her golden-brown head . " I am sure of it , M'sieur Ambrose . He is a fanatic in his loyalty to the cause . " " I have no right to ask this but  --  is he in love with you ? " " I  --  I rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ambrose , whose face was clouded with uneasiness , " I know you well enough to be sure there is no use attempting top326dissuade you from this course . You are gentle and sweet , and you get more lovely all the time , but at heart you 're as much of a fanatic as he is . But what is this move going to mean ? Do you realize fully the dangers you 'll face ? Are you prepared to take the risk of being sent back to the man who owned you ? " She returned his look with equal intentness . " I am ready to take any risk to be of service to these poor , persecuted people . " He reached out a hand abruptly . " Let me see your purse , " he demanded . There was a moment of hesitation on her part . Then she produced from under her belt a small purse of threadbare velvet . This she placed on the table in front of him . He did not open it but , after a moment 's study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he pressed it with the tips of his fingers . " No bank notes , " he said . " Only silver . And little of that . Two shillings , perhaps . " " About two shillings . " " Is that all you have ? " She nodded . " I need little . I have no expenses . " " You always dressed with great taste and discrimination . That dress you are wearing is neat but it 's not new . Is it a fair sample of your present wardrobe ? " She flushed . " I am proud to tell you that it is my wardrobe , M'sieur Inquisitor . " " But it was your cleverness or intuition which brought all this flood of gold into the place . Are you sure this fellow outside is disposing of the funds honestly ? " " I have already told you that he is honest and devoted to the cause . " It was clear to both visitors that they could say or do nothing to change her mind . She was devoted to the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , Ambrose Brinker opened the purse . " You must allow us one small privilege , " he said . He nodded to Julian and they began to empty their pockets of the bank notes they had with them . Ambrose folded the notes carefully , placed them in the purse , closed it and then placed it in her hand . At first she made a movement as though to refuse the gift . Then she hesitated , thinking intently with her eyes lowered to the table . Finally she took up the purse and replaced it under her belt . She favored them with a smile which was rather shamefaced . " I will accept your kind gift , " she said . " And I want to thank you both from the bottom of my heart . I know it is right for all of us who belong to share and share alike but  --  well , sometimes I ca n't help regretting that Ip327have so little in my purse . " She smiled then , the first real smile she had given them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , warm feeling about having money in your pocket . " " Keep it for your own use , " admonished Ambrose with sudden sharpness of tone . On the way out he stopped at the desk where Reuban Dupuis was still sitting . He laid one hand on its surface and looked down at this man of whom he entertained such serious doubts . Dupuis looked up at him and for a moment nothing was said . " M'sieur Dupuis , " said Ambrose , " I do n't like you and I do n't trust you . If anything should happen to Ma'amselle Philline , I shall know about it . I have influence in the island which can be used to apply any punishment which may be deserved . Keep that always in your mind . " The man 's eyes were filled with an implacable hatred . " You were once a slaveowner , " he said . " Someday , some place , you 'll be punished for that , M'sieur Brinker . " They walked slowly away together , making no response to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside guard . " Well , " said Ambrose finally , " I must now proceed to sell this tidy little business I 've built up for myself . " " No ! " cried Julian , seizing him by the arm and giving him a protesting shake . " You can go only so far with this quixotic attitude . She 's beautiful and she 's brave but she 's cutting herself away from you , my friend . Get over it as I did when Isabelle gave me my conge . " " Do you think I would ever have any peace of mind if I did ? " demanded the Jamaican . " I ca n't stay here and let her go back to the island to face danger and perhaps the loss of her freedom . No , Julian , my mind is made up . I 'll sell out and return to Jamaica . I must be there to look out for her . To be on hand if she needs help at any time . It 's my fate to do this . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  |p328Samuel  Carboy was often at home these days . Things continued to go well with him in the world of business . The financial depression was worse than ever in the country but the Carboy interests were showing small traces of it . They paid little in the way of profits , it was true , and they had cut wages , but they continued to operate and to make their way . This , however , had nothing to do with the greater frequency of his periods of rest at Beaulaw Hall . The truth of the matter was that he had so much money now that he had turned inevitably to surrounding himself with beauty . Knowing nothing at all of such things , of the value of precious stones , of what constituted the best in painting and sculpture , of tapestries or Georgian silver , he was still able instinctively to select the real from the spurious . " I do n't know anything about rubies , " he once boasted . " But put a handful of them down in front of me and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , I 'll grade them without a single mistake . " " Buy when things are bad , " was another remark he had often made . " When merchants need money , that 's the time to pick up the things you want . " As a result he was actively in the market for paintings and bits of marble sculpture , and rugs and old furniture . Beaulaw Hall was beginning to reflect the soundness of his judgment . He was particularly interested in the fine furniture of the previous century and was never so happy as when he had picked up , often at absurdly low prices , a beautiful desk , a breakfront , a drum table or even a mahogany wine cooler . He was standing in front of his latest acquisition , a William and Mary escritoire , and practically drooling ( to quote Mrs. Carboy , who did not sympathize with his new hobby and really preferred furniture with a high varnish finish and with lots of knobs and hand carving ) over its splendid square lines and its spare display of inlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lady Gardiner has arrived , sir . " Within a very few minutes Mrs. Carboy flounced into the room , followed by her daughter . " Mr. Carboy , " she exclaimed , " this child of yours has left her husband ! "  | " Nonsense , Mama , " said Isabelle . She was looking very cool and composedand more beautiful than ever . " You get so upset over trifles . I 'm not breaking up my home . I 'm just disciplining Tibby . He 's so unreasonable . And when he gets angry at me he does n't rage and get it all over with in one fine , jolly scene . Instead he just sulks . I ca n't bear sulkers . " " You little idiot ! " said Mrs. Carboy . " I 'm sure you 've been flirting . " " Of course I 've been flirting . My sweet Mama , why should n't I ? Everybodyflirts . Every man I meet whispers things in my ear . Tibby is too oldfashionedfor words . " " If you were n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would send you up to your room this instant . " " You do n't need to , dear Mama . That is exactly where I 'm going . I 'm going to get into riding clothes and go out for a little toot around the country . " It was late in the afternoon when Isabelle returned . Her father found her in the library where she was sitting in a deep chair with one slim booted leg crossed over the other . She had taken off her hat and her head was a mass of crinkling golden brown . Mrs. Carboy was sitting opposite and looking intensely critical . " Hello , Papa , " said Isabelle . " Who do you suppose I rode home with ? Young Chip . He overtook me near Willikin Creek , coming thundering up on his hunter and shouting and waving his crop . He was delighted to see me . " " Your husband does n't like Young Chip , " declared Mrs. Carboy . " He dislikesall the men you ride with and golf with and sit with in conservatories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chip . You know that , do n't you ? " " Of course . He did n't mind Chip running around at my heels as long as he was a boy . But now Chip is growing up . My , my , how he 's growing up ! " Her father had found this conversation very disturbing . To change the subject he asked how Young Chip had reported on the state of affairs at Outland Park . " They 're in the dumps , " answered Isabelle . " As you know , they badgered poor Blettor into marrying that pottery widow and it turns out she 's a regular nagger . Young Chip , who is positively amusing at times , calls her the Vinegar Virgin . That 's kind of good , is n't it ? And it seems she has n't as much money as they thought . Not nearly enough certainly to put things right at Outland . Poor Old Sheppy never stirs out of the house now , he 's so feeble , and he shudders whenever he hears his daughter-in-law 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . I must make him a visit tomorrow . I 'm about the only one who can make him laugh any more . "  | " You 'll do nothing of the sort ! " declared Mrs. Carboy . " You want to go so you can see the grandson again . Besides , your husband will arrive on the evening coach . " " I suppose he will , and it will be such a bother . " " I hear the grandson 's going to be married soon , " said Carboy . " To the daughter of that banker in Birmingham . Avery Trask . I hear she 's a plain little thing . " " Poor Chip ! " Isabelle sighed sympathetically . " He knows he 's in for it . It wo n't last long , that marriage . He kills off horses as fast as the Vinegar Virgin will buy them for him and he 'll probably have the same way with wives . He was arguing with me most furiously today , as he always does . He wants me to divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so casually thrown out , drove Mrs. Carboy into enraged protest . She sat up straight in her chair and shook a finger at her daughter . " Isabelle ! We 'll have no divorces in this family . How would you like to have hostlers giving evidence in court and impudent maids telling what they 've seen through keyholes ? " " Mama , how can you be so vulgar ? One would think I had been having affairs with butlers and xunning around the country with bagmen . How can you conceive such things ? It must be your father cropping out in you . Really ! " " Listen to me , young woman . All I have to do is repeat that remark to Grandfather Hanlon and he 'll cut you right out of his will . " Isabelle gave her heasl an indifferent toss . " He 's leaving almost everything to Allie anyway . Why should I care ? " Mrs. Carboy got to her feet . " I wo n't stay and be treated this way , young lady . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " But as she reached the door Fleck appeared , carrying a silver plate heaped with mail . " Groody just came , ma'am , " he said . " He gets later all the time . And drunker , ma'am , if you 'll allow me to say so . " Mrs. Carboy took the letters , thumbed them through and then emitted a shriek of delight . " Here it is ! I 've been waiting for it so long . A letter from America , from my dear Allie . Oh , what a lovely surprise ! " She took her precious letter to a window embrasure and sat down to read it . " What a beautiful hand he writes ! " she enthused . " It shows how clever he really is . You need n't try to tell me anything different , Mr. Carboy . Mv Allie will surprise us all someday . " Carboy was talking to his daughter . " Isabelle , did you read about the death of that old woman up in Westmoreland ? She was the last survivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F ? I do n't know what you 're talking about , Papa . " " Class F in the Waterloo Tontine . You remember surely . It was confined to people of sixty and over and so it has n't taken long to get finished . This old Mrs. Grabling did quite well during the two years when she had all the income to herself . Over six thousand pounds a year . " " Oh , that Tontine . I have n't given it a thought in years . It seems unimportantwhen I think of all the plans I have for myself . " " Isabelle ! Are you serious ? " Her father , it was clear , was very much taken aback . " I ca n't believe that you , of all people , would say such a thing . Isabelle , I will be dead before the payments from the Tontine become large and so I 'm very much concerned about you . I will probably leave enough to make you the richest woman in the world but "  --  he paused , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong  --  " but how can I tell what will happen when I 'm not here to keep things in hand ? You may marry again and your husband may play ducks and drakes with the money . Husbands have a habit of squandering the fortunes they 've done nothing to earn . And money can shrivel , you know . It can fly right out the window . Times change . Even the wisest of people make mistakes . I want to see you protected from all such possibilities . The Tontine will do it . " " Papa , I expect to marry again  --  in course of time . But no husband will ever have a chance to play ducks and drakes with my money . " Carboy looked very much relieved . " I 'm glad to hear you say that . I was afraid you had changed . " " But you must allow , Papa , that the Tontine is a small matter --  " " No , no ! that 's where you are wrong . The Tontine is firmly established  --  Sir Theobald and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll in , year after year . You 'll be amazed how fast the amounts will grow that are paid out to each member . Do you know that seventy-six have died in your class since the last report ? If you survive into the final stages  --  and I 'm confident you will , my pet  --  the time may come when you 'll look forward to the money from it , and you 'll watch the health of the other survivors , and sometimes you may even say a prayer or two , Oh , kind God , let me be the one to go on living ! ' " " My dear , big , successful Papa , do n't you know that I appreciate money as much as you do ? But there 's something more important than money . Social standing . Do you remember when I said I would n't be content with a husband of lower rank than a duke ? I meant it ; and I 'm going to marry a duke in the end . If no better one comes along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all in the future but you must realize , Papa , thatp332when I 'm a duchess it wo n't do for me to be concerned in anything as commonas a tontine . Either I would have to sign away my share or turn the income over to charity as a gesture . " " It 's a gesture you 'll never make , child , " said Carboy grimly . " I do n't believe in handing over money to committees of impoverished nincompoops and climbing women . There 's more malfeasance in charity than there is in government . People have to be helped  --  within reason  --  but I do n't like so many lily-white hands dipping into the pot first . " " Come , come , Papa . You 're taking me too seriously . I 'm never going to be silly enough to give money away  --  unless there are strings to it . " " Good . But just the same I want to repeat what I said . Something keeps telling me that the Tontine will turn out in the end to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll remember , Papa . And I 'll ease your mind on one point . I 'll always keep my husbands under my thumb . They wo n't have any say about my money . " Carboy frowned somberly . " Just the same I wish  --  I wish I could always . be here to look after things . " Mrs. Carboy had been sitting very still in the window embrasure . The letter had fallen into her lap . If her husband and daughter had not been so concerned with other matters they would have noticed that her lips were trembling and her face was white . Suddenly she got to her feet and gave the bellpull a nervous shake . When the butler appeared she said in a shrill voice , " Close all the windows , Fleck . " " Close the windows , ma'am ? " Fleck seemed surprised at such an order , as well he might , it being an uncomfortably warm evening . " Every one . Close them down tight . Draw the curtains , Fleck . And then close the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long room quickly became almost unbearable . When he had left , Mrs. Carboy stood beside her chair for a moment , as motionless as a figure in bronze . Then she threw her arms above her head and began to emit moans and stifled cries , gradually allowing her voice to rise in volume . Carboy looked in frowning alarm at his daughter . " Good gad , Isabelle , what 's wrong with your mother ? Has she gone mad ? Hurry , child , send for a doctor ! " The outcries from the distraught woman continued , becoming louder . She had taken to running blindly about the room , bumping into chairs and tables and stumbling over stools . Her husband caught her by both wrists and tried to force her down into a chair , looking back over his shoulder as he did so in an appeal for help in this unprecedented situation.  | " Isabelle , you must do something ! " he cried . " Do n't stand there staring at me . Get Fleck . Get her maid . Send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better now , Papa , " said Isabelle coolly . " You know how it is . She lets herself go when she has bad news . I think the letter from Allie must have some very bad news . Yes , I 've seen her do this before . " Carboy unceremoniously seated his wife in the chair and stood over her , prepared to resist any effort on her part to begin again . " Come now , " he said in a tone which he strove to make sympathetic . " Tell us what it is . We must n't have any more of this kind of thing , you know . What will the servants think ? " " What has Allie done , Mama ? " demanded the daughter . " He 's married ! " Mrs. Carboy got the dreadful words out with considerabledifficulty . " I thought he was at death 's door , the way you carried on , my dear , " said Carboy . His first reaction to the news had been one of relief that it was no worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise . His cheeks became red . " Married ? Good gad , who to ? It could n't be the Bonaparte woman . Is it  --  is it one of those Indian princesses ? " Mrs. Carboy was gradually getting herself under control , now that the extent of the calamity had been revealed . " Oh , how dreadful that I 've got to say it . My Allie has married an actress . A little chit who --  Isabelle , bring me that letter . Here it is . He says she 's pretty and gay , and has red hair , and the  --  the most beautiful legs in the world . What a dreadful thing for him to write to his own mother ! " " She sounds perfectly charming , " commented Isabelle . " But not as a sister-in-law . Or a daughter-in-law either , dear Mama . I always thought something like this would happen , only I 'd have laid my bets it would be a barmaid . Or a coachman 's daughter like the Groody creature . " " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing ? " demanded the father of the erring Allie . " Speak up , woman . He must have made some explanation in that beautiful writing you were raving about . " " You 'll be sorry you wanted to know , Mr. Carboy ! " declared his wife grimly . " He was starving . Because his unfeeling father would n't send him any money and because he was too proud to ask for help . He was going to throw himself into the ocean and end it all but he was offered a chance to act with a company of theatrical players . So he took it in desperation , and he proved to be such a good actor that they made him the  --  the leading man . Do n't look so astonished , Mr. Carboy . They have theaters in America , just the same as here . This girl was in the company and he fell in love with her , even though the leading lady was in love with him --  "  |p334Carboy  's face had turned a curious mottled gray . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've done everything a father could for the boy . " " You were always hard and cruel to him , you cut him off , you starved him ! " cried his wife . " This is all your fault and you need n't try to escape the blame . " " From coachman 's daughter , to princess , to leading lady , to breeches girl , " said Isabelle . " Allie has broad tastes , has n't he ? " " Unfeeling child ! " cried Mrs. Carboy . " I believe you 're glad . I believe you 're thinking that now your father will be cruel and monstrous enough to cut the poor boy off and that you 'll come in for all the money . I know you , my girl . " Isabelle went to the bell and gave it an impatient tug . " Open the windows , Fleck , " she said when the butler appeared . " Mrs. Carboy has recovered from her indisposition . " The butler withdrew and for several moments the three members of the family stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabelle who broke it . " Dinner tonight wo n't be a very festive occasion . Especially if Tibby arrives and is still in the sulks . I 'm going to have mine in my room . And I want a good solid one . I need it after this demonstration of the idiotic strain which runs in our family . " " I wo n't be able to swallow a mouthful , " declared Mrs. Carboy in a weak voice . " I 'm going straight to bed . " Sir Theobald Gardiner did not come and so the head of the household sat at dinner by himself . He consumed dish after dish without pause and without relish . Then he began to drink . His thoughts , which had been **25;8876;TOOLONG while he dined , took a new turn . He became angry . " An actor ! " he said aloud , at a moment when all of the servants were out of the room . " My son , the son of Samuel Carboy who is turning the business of the Empire upside down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strutting fools who caper and rant and make fools of themselves for a living ! He does n't get it from the Carboy side . We 've been solid and sensible and hard-working for generations . It must come from the other side . They 've got plenty of bad blood of one kind or another . Old Whip married his housemaid . " He sat and glowered as his thoughts turned to the occupation his son had chosen ; having no alternative , it was true . Finally , with the deepest scorn , he began to recite lines from plays which came into his mind . " To be or not to be . ' Gad , what tosh ! The carriage awaits , m'lord . ' Faugh ! At last I have ye in my power , proud gel ! ' And that 's the way my son is making his living ! " The brown line in the whisky decanter diminished and sank , and finallyp335disappeared . When another had taken its place , the magnate 's mood changed . He became sentimental , even a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife says ? " he asked himself . " Did I drive the poor boy to this ? Gad , I 've a notion to take the first boat to New York and get everything straightened out . I could buy that redheaded baggage off and send her about her business . Then I would bring Alfred back and in no time at all the whole thing would be forgotten . I could take him in hand and make something of him . " A tear of self-pity appeared in the corner of one eye . " But what in thunder could I make of a son like that ? " In the morning he realized that he could not spare the time to go to America . A hundred matters of the utmost importance pressed upon him . Instead , therefore , he wrote a crisp and peremptory letter , enclosing a substantialmoney order , demanding that his son return at once to discuss his future . Alone , he added . The baggage must be left behind . A bagman came riding into Little Shallow in a red-wheeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that his horse kept up a lively gait and he himself whistled with a fine abandon . He gave every evidence , in fact , of being well content with life . " Here I come , here I come , here I come ! " he sang in a thin tenor voice as he opened the door of the Groody shop and walked in . Nell issued out from the dining room beyond , looking very cool and neat and businesslike in a dress of Henrietta cloth . There were changes in her appearance and all of them for the better . She looked composed and sure of herself , although her dark hair had been given a titus cut so that it clustered on her forehead in crisp curls and made her look as young as on that never-to-be-forgotten day when she met Alfred Carboy at the ruined church . " Good afternoon , Mr. Crashly , " she said . " Good afternoon , partner , " said Mr. Crashly , eying her in a way which could only be called covetous . " You look extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been given to a certain suggestion I made  --  that you and I make it an out-and-outer ? A partnership for life , no less . " " I have n't changed my mind about that . " Nell was looking out the windowat the smart equipage with red wheels . " And I never will , Mr. Crashly . And now about other matters . Business is good , I trust ? " " Business is good . Business , in fact , could n't be better . The profits arep336growing all the time . Grimes buys the goods at low prices and I go out and sell ' em at high prices . When you invested your two hundred pounds with us , dear lady  --  and I concede we could n't have got started if you had n't and so you 're entitled to your third  --  you picked two good horses to put your brass on . " " I was sure of that , " declared Nell . " I knew Mr. Grimes was a solid businessman and that you , Mr. Crashly , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've two other investments in mind for you , " declared the born salesman , with a wink . " First , a husband . Me . Ah , partner , what a good combination that would be ! I know you are n't in a mood to invest in me yet but you 'll come around to it in time . You ca n't remain blind to all my perfections forever . You 're stubborn but you got a good head on you . I 'm counting on that . " He winked again . " This other one is a real investment . A man I 've heard of down Reading way . He 's got a bit of equipment he invented himself . It 's a signal for starting and stopping trains . They tell me it 's mighty clever and that none of these railroads will be able to get along without it . But he 's as short of cash as a farm hand after a village fair . Someone 's got to finance him or he wo n't be able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nell had discarded her casual manner and was watching him with a serious air . " You 've suggested several things to me , Mr. Crashly , at various times but I 've never given any of them a second thought . Perhaps this is different . You see , in anything as new as a railway the people who finance the first construction are almost certain to lose everything they put in . I read all about it in a book . But those who hold patents on devices which have to be used , and paid for right from the start , they 're the ones who make great fortunes . If this man has something really good , we might all make some money out of it . What 's his name , Mr. Crashly ? " " Got it right here . " The former bagman produced a piece of paper from a pocket . " That 's his name and address . You got gold in your hand , partner . And , blow me tight , I was the one to put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket of her apron . " And now that we 're speaking of profits , Mr. Crashly , I have this thought to put before you . I 'm sure you and Mr. Grimes can go on making money . But are we going to be as successful at keeping it ? You seem to travel in high style . That cart , now . " Oh , that ! It pays to cut a good figure , my dear and very observant little partner . It brings in the business . I like you to come down on me like this , just the same . Makes me want to tweak that pretty little ear which hears so much and kiss those eyes which see so much . Ah , to have you coming downp337on me all the rest of my life ! " He fumbled in the same pocket and produced , first of all , a letter he did not want seen . At any rate he stuffed it back again hastily and gave Nell a rather furtive look to see if she had noticed . What he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dearest lady , are the figures ; and I rather think that you wo n't want to come down on us about them . Do you wish to go over them now ? " " I do indeed , " declared Nell . Mr. Crashly was gone , after satisfying the shrewd young proprietress of the Little Shallow shop that her investment would continue to yield her good returns . The sun had sunk deeply enough in the west to make it difficult for Mrs. Groody 's eyes , which were not as good as they had once been , to continue with her knitting . Nell was sitting at her desk , her hands folded in her lap , her thoughts far away . Daniel Groody drove the mail cart into the yard and came into the shop on legs which were far from steady . He created such a loud jingling of the bell on the door that it might have been expected that some great merchant had come to offer a thousand pounds for the business ; an offer , however , which Nell would never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's glad I am to see you resting for once . I like to see my little girl just sitting there and enjoying the nice sunset and not worriting over books and papers . " Nell brought her mind back from wherever it had gone ; the United States of America , one might have assumed . She studied her father with a somber eye . " I see you 've visited all the taverns , Father , " she said . " And after the talks we 've had ! " All trace of exuberance left Daniel Groody 's manner and he looked very unhappy and penitent at once . He stood in front of her desk and fumbled with his cap . " Yes , childie , " he said . " It 's all of them I 've been to this day . But not for , ny own pleasure , I 'll want you to know . " He continued to stare down at her . " It 's bad news I have for you . I do n't like the telling of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each of them and get my courage up a little . " Nell looked up at him slowly . Bad news ! It must have to do with Allie Carboy , she thought at once . Was he ill ? Was he  --  was he dead ? She felt so sick at heart as these possibilities took possession of her mind that she could not force her lips to ask a question . " It 's about this young Carboy , " said her father . He swallowed before going on . " It comes to this , Nelly . He 's married . He 's gone and got himself another wife , the ill-begotten cur to treat my little girl so ! "  | " Married ! " Somehow this seemed worse in the first few shocked moments than any of the dire surmises which she had conjured up . She had always been sure that Allie loved her . He was weak and thoughtless but she had never thought it possible he would love anyone else . She looked up at her father with so much grief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . " Married , Father ? When , when ? " " I do n't know as to that , childie . It 's a long time letters take to reach us here from America . Weeks and weeks . The news has spread fast , my little Nelly . It was told me many places . " There was a long pause and then she asked in a subdued voice , " Who did he marry , Father ? " " An actress . A dancer , as light in the head as in the heels , no doubt . " An actress ! Nell felt a slight amelioration of her grief . She was sure she could not have borne it if the girl her Allie had married had been one of the eligible kind , the daughter of a rich man , who rode to hounds and had an income of her own ; the possessor , in other words , of all the advantages she herself had lacked . That he had shown enough courage to marry an actress brought her an instant pang ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have brought him finally to her ) and at the same time a curious kind of pleasure . What would the Carboys , father , mother and sister , think of this ? They would suffer also . For a brief moment she was almost glad of what had happened . A very brief moment , however . The first reaction was followed by a realization of the irrevocability of what had happened . Allie was married . She would never see him again , never see him smile , never hear his voice . All the hopes she had secretly cherished were shattered . She knew now , if she had not before , that she could never love anyone else . All that life had to offer her was the dull routine of living , from hour to hour , from day to day . " I 'm going to my room , " she said in a voice devoid of all expression . " Please , Father , see that I 'm not disturbed . " Nell 's parents discussed her at breakfast , hovering over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's no sleep she had last night , the poor child , " said her father . " Twice I waked up and both times I heard her moving about her room . " Mrs. Groody gave her head an emphatic shake . " She 's going to suffer for it . I warned her . I told her a hundred times to put him out of her mind . 1 said it from the very start . " " Words never rule the hearts of the young , " said Daniel Groody . " Don'tp339you see , woman , that the poor child could n't help herself ? She loved him . Holy Mother Mary help her now , for she still loves him ! " Mrs. Groody changed the subject abruptly . " You were drunk last night , " she charged . The ex-coachman did not deny the accusation or try to dodge the issue . " That I was . I had n't the courage to face her and tell her the bad news . So I dropped in at this place and I dropped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I get out of it . " " You 'll not be able to keep on the mail route , " warned his wife . " There 's plenty of talk about it already , Daniel Groody . People are complaining . You 're always late and you 're always a little tozie , and they do n't like it . " His temper began to show signs of rising . " You do n't know what you 're saying , woman ! " he declared . " I know what people are saying  --  and that 's what counts . They 're saying they want someone who 'll be on time and wo n't smell like a grogshop . They 're tired of you , Daniel Groody , and that 's the truth . " Groody 's face showed the hurt of a boy who has stumbled on the fact that others do not like him . He began to defend himself , although it was clear there was little conviction in what he said . " But they 're glad to see me . It 's Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they laugh with me . At the Beau and the Britches , it 's always , Here comes Dan Groody and he 'll have a story for us . ' " " It 's not your cronies I 'm talking about . It 's the people in the big houses who want the mail on time , and the merchants and the doctors and all the bigwigs . They 're going to complain about it to the member . And if they do that 's the last of you , Daniel Groody , because the member will go to the post office about it . " For a long time he made ho comment but continued to sit very still , a stricken look on his face . Finally he gave his head a single nod and began to speak in the hopeless tone of a prisoner pleading guilty . " I would n't hurt her for all the world . You know that , wife . And I want her to make money out of this farming of the mails . It 's happy I 've been , driving my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll drop out at once . I will indeed . " They could hear Nell 's footsteps on the stair and so nothing more was said . They were pretending to eat bacon when she came into the room , and they looked up to say no more than " Good morning . " Daniel Groody could see out of the corner of his eye that she was pale . Mrs. Groody got to her feet to bring another plate . " No breakfast , Mother , " said Nell . " I 'm not hungry but you must n't be worried . I 'm going to survive . " She sat down at the table , facing them . " I'mp340going to dread talking to people  --  for a time . So I 'm going to let Nanty "  --  the little northern girl who helped in the store and waited on customers in the tea stalls  --  " take charge for a few days . There are some errands which will take my mind off things , I hope . Father , do you think you could turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childie . There 's Early Crackaday , who has a good hand on the reins and knows the country from the Vale to the Thames . But is it just for today we might get him ? Or , perhaps , for all days ? " Nell looked at him intently and for a moment she forgot her own woes in the contemplation of his . " Father , we 'll have to talk about that soon . I have some ideas . But all I want to do today is to have you drive me to Reading . There 's a man near there I must see at once . " 3It was in the early fall of that year and the Vale had never looked more festive . The trees were a mass of yellow and red and the oak-beamed houses on the one street of the village had dahlias which seemed to reach to the slanting gables . Even the stubble in the fields suggested a bountiful harvest , so plentiful , in fact , that the men who had tilled the soil felt free to take an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy their beauty . Luke Finan , the philosophical landlord of the George and Charlotte , added to his reputation for queerness by remarking that the Horse itself was a bit fat abat the ribs and demned if I do n't think the beast has slowed daown to a jog trot . " One evening Early Crackaday returned with the red cart and old Barney , bringing with him as usual the letters he had accumulated on his rounds and which would be sorted and placed on the coaches the next day . He ; was fairly bursting with news , which made it very hard for Daniel Groody . The latter had insisted on giving up the route and had recommended Crackaday for his place . Once the change had been made , however , he had soured on his successor . He turned his back on him whenever they met and refused to say a word . It was Mrs. Groody who came out to receive the letters . " There 's trouble at Beaulaw Hall , " said Crackaday . " Terrible trouble , I 'm thinking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I do n't know . " The voice of Daniel Groody reached them from where he was standing behind the half-open door of the shop . " He does n't know what it is ! Is he deaf and blind ? "  | " I ast questions but it was no answers I got , " protested the new mailman . " Woman , he must have more to tell us . Get it out of him . Pump him ! " " Come out and pump him yourself like a man instead of skulking there , " replied Mrs. Groody , who had no patience with her spouse 's idiosyncrasies . " I 'll tell you everything I know , Mrs. Groody , " said Crackaday humbly . He stood in awe of his predecessor , expecting that Groody would demand the job back at any minute . " It started when the darter and hoosband arrived this morning on the Lunnon coach . " " Make him speak up , wife ! I ca n't half hear . " " They come on the Lunnon coach , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Leddy Ga'd'ner . The car'ge from the Hall was waiting and off they went wi'out a word to anyone . " " How did they look ? " asked Mrs. Groody . " I don ' know . I didn ' see it but I hear ' bout it . Leddy Ga'd'ner had only two bags . Does that mean aught ? Gen'lly she has six . " " It means a lot , Mr. Crackaday , " answered Mrs. Groody . " If she had only two bags , it means she was fair upset about something . How many maids did she bring ? " " One . " " Only one ! Then she 's so distracted she does n't know what she 's doing , that 's clear . " Daniel Groody spoke up from behind the door . " It 's Mrs. Carboy . It 's sick she is and no mistake . " He added in a tone of deep regret , " It 's a whole pund I 'd give to have been at the Hall this day ! " " All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Git on with ye now . ' Not a word would he give me . " " I 'd have got it out of him , " commented Groody . Partly in self-defense , the new driver of the mail came forward now with another piece of information . " He was seen driving down the Oxford road . This ev'ning . ' Bout five-thirty . " " Who was seen ? Are you lame in the brain , man ! " " Sam'l Carboy was seen . Driving in that car'ge with four horses , all smokinghot and covered with lather . They came at the gallop and Humpster was a-shouting at them and a-cracking his whip . And Jenny Taskery saw him looking out the window . She says he was white as a marr'ge sheet and he looked like Old Horny hisself . " " Perhaps it 's Mr. Carboy that 's ill , " suggested Mrs. Groody . " Perhaps he has taken sick on his trip . " Daniel Groody brushed this aside . " It 's Mrs. Carboy , I tell you . She'sp342been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though it 's said she has a fresh bottle of the stuff sent up each morning reg'lar . " " Did you talk to Jennie Taskery , Mr. Crackaday ? " asked Mrs. Groody . " No , ma'am . I got the news ' bout her at the Lonely Camel . " At this piece of information , Daniel Groody relinquished the role of bystanderand , as he would have expressed it himself , got into the conversation with both feet . " So , you were at the Lonely Camel ! " he said . " Let me tell you something , my man , for your own good . Though why I bother about you , I do n't know . There 'll be no drinking on this route , Mister Early Crackaday . Just fall into that habit and it 's a new mail driver we 'll be looking for . " Crackaday drew himself up with an attempt at dignity . " I had a letter for Sim Eavewright . And where else would I find him , Dan'l Groody , but in his own inn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nell had been listening from the window of her bedroom above , having caught the word " Carboy . " At this point , however , she ceased to be interested in what they were saying . It was clear to her that Crackaday had told everything he knew and , in any case , she was convinced they were wrong in their surmises about Mrs. Carboy . She was certain herself that it was not the health of that estimable lady which had brought Sir Theobald and Lady Gardiner by coach from London in such haste and had caused Samuel Carboy to come galloping down from the north at as mad a pace as the great Napoleon had ever demanded , shuttling back and forth over the roads of Europe . " It 's about Allie ! " said Nell to herself . She went to a chair and dropped inertly into it . " I know it is ! It ca n't be anything else . What can it be now ? Oh , what has he done ! " She remained huddled in the chair for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was causing so much commotion . " Oh , Allie , Allie ! " she sobbed . " What have you done ? Are you ill ? Have you been hurt ? Have you , " hopefully , " run away from that terrible actress wife ? " But it was not his actress wife that Alfred Carboy had run away from . Sometimes , it must be said , he had given consideration to that idea : when Emmy had seemed unnecessarily scatterbrained or had flirted too openly with men in the audience or other members of the company . It was for a different reason entirely ; but he had gone away . The news reached the shop at Little Shallow late in the evening and it was brought by Dr. Moggridge . He had been summoned to Beaulaw Hall to administer sedatives to Mrs. Carboy and he was now to be disappointed in his main reason for driving three miles out of his way on the return trip.  |p343Nell  Groody was not there to greet him when he entered the shop , her place being taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor gruffly . He was a huge man and had always made his rounds on horseback until he overheard someone remark , " Dr. Moggridge kills as many horses as he does patients . " Now he used a small gig which creaked and groaned under his weight . " Good evening , Doctor . What are you needing , sir ? " " A spool of cotton . " When Mrs. Groody went to rummage for it ( she never had any idea where the stock was kept ) , he cleared his throat . " Sad news at Beaulaw Hall , ma'am . " Mrs. Groody suspended her search and straightened up . " Indeed , Doctor ? We have n't heard . " " They 've lost their son . " The medical man 's voice was absurdly highpitchedto issue from such a large frame . " The word reached them yesterdayfrom America . Lady Gardiner was at a country house in Kent and Mr. Carboy was in the Midlands . There was a great to-do about getting them back . Mrs. Carboy is prostrated . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I am greatly worried about her . " Mrs. Groody had been staring at him with her mouth wide open in astonishment . It was with difficulty that she found her tongue . " What happened to the poor young man ? " she asked . " Well , it was a strange thing , ma'am . He was actually engaged with a company of touring players when it happened . You knew he was an actor ? " Mrs. Groody nodded . " It seems the company decided to go on a tour of some of the places in the far West . I do n't know any of the heathenish names , although one curious word seems to stick in my mind . Buffalo . Could that be the name of a place , do you suppose ? Most highly unlikely , in my opinion . Well , they did their traveling in vehicles called covered wagons . Again I profess my ignorance . I have no conception of what a covered wagon is . Young Mr. Carboy was not accustomed to the severe cold they encountered while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he got taken down with pneumony . Do you know what that is ? An inflammation of the lungs . It 's a serious business at any time , and it happened that they did not reach a town until he was pretty far gone with it . So he died . A very sad ending , ma'am , very sad indeed . He would have been a rich and prominent man someday . I always thought him a most attractive young gentleman . " Mrs. Groody continued to stare at him and made no comment . " Your daughter is well ? " asked the doctor , after waiting several moments for some verbal reaction . " Well enough , Doctor . She 's upstairs at her books . I 'm thinking , Doctor ,  |p344she  may not be quite as well when she hears this news you 've brought . " " I 'm afraid not , ma'am . You will give her my regards ? A very bright young woman , your daughter . I have grown to have quite an admiration for her . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He left them without waiting for the spool of cotton , so it may be assumed that it had been no more than an excuse for visiting the store with the news of Allie Carboy 's death . When the doctor had stepped into his gig and departed , Nell 's parents sat down together and stared into each other 's eyes . Mrs. Groody was in tears . " Dan , I ca n't do it . I ca n't tell the child . It 's going to break her heart this time . I 've been watching her for the past weeks and it 's clear to me she 's not well . She does n't eat enough to keep a bird alive . " In the face of this emergency , Daniel Groody seemed to achieve dignity and stature . He drew himself up with a suggestion of pride . " And who but her own father should tell the child ? " he asked . " There must be no delay , so it 's upstairs I 'll go at once . " He rose to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be hard , wife . She knows ! I could tell from the look in her eyes when we told her of the commotion among the Carboys . She knew he was dead then . But I 'll do my best to speak gently to her and not hurt her feelings . " It was a Sunday morning and Julian had been invited to share the Pardons ' noon dinner . He knew that he would meet the leg of mutton at least four times during the ensuing week in various guises and so he was glad of the chance to see and taste it in its first glory . Mr. Pardon was giving the carving knife a final scrape on the stone sharpener when the familiar sound of Noel 's whistle was heard in the street . For several weeks Noel had been dividing his time . His mistress still had first call on his services but each morning at eight sharp Julian would issue out from the house and find the kittereen waiting for him , Noel on the box with a broad smile of greeting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed by all members of the staff . He had ceased to be Grace to his fellow workers and had become any one of many nicknames , including the Nabob , the Sultan , Croesus and Mr. Brads Himself . Noel had much to learn but his good nature was so unshakable and his loyalty so complete that those he served had no desire to change him . One of the things he never got through his head was that England was not a land of wide-open doors and free-and-easy ways . He considered it quite proper to join in conversations and his head was as often turned to address his passengers as it was to the traffic through which he drove . He was full of curiosity and had no reluctance in asking questions . He enjoyed giving advice . " M's'r Ju ' , " he would say , " you doan ' wan ' wear dat ole blue coat to wo'k three days in row . " The habit which caused the most concern was his unwillingness to get down from the box and knock on doors to announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give forth whistled summonsin four bars which to Julian sounded like the words , " Hurry , Come , Boss Man . " It was this message which reached Julian 's ears as Mr. Pardon prepared to carve the roast . He looked apologetically at his hostess . " I 'm afraid , " he said , " that something has happened to demand my presence . " Mrs. Pardon , who had never seen Winifred but approved of her unreservedlybecause she was an heiress , gave him a smiling release . " If it 's the pretty young lady , Mr. Grace , you must not delay , " she said . " Hurry , you must not keep her waiting . " Noel was standing beside the horse and he bowed almost to the waist when Julian appeared . " I'se to tak ' yu , m's'r , " he said , climbing back briskly to the box . " Us late now . Git in quick , m's'r . " " Is it Miss Winifred ? " " Yes , Mist ' Ju ' . Hit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him ? I do n't understand , Noel . Who is with Miss Winifred ? " " The Brizzer , sub . The Great Say-so . Miss Win'fed 's fathah , sub . Mist ' Ball ' . " " Mr. Ballard ! Here ? Are you sure ? " " Yes , Mist ' Ju ' . I'se suah . " It was a beautiful day with a sun high in a cloudless sky but Julian now felt as though the whole world had turned cold and clouded over . This sudden visit of Timothy Ballard 's was ominous . It meant he had not been content to write his rejection of Julian as a suitor but had caught the first boat and had come over to deliver it in person . " This can mean only onep346thing , " thought Julian . " He 'll say no to me in no uncertain terms . Then he 'll whisk my sweet Winifred away to Jamaica . And I 'll never see her again . " " Noel , " he said to the driver , " do you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A grin spread over Noel 's face . " Yes , Mist ' Ju ' . Ah knows dat . " " Do you know I want to marry her ? " " In cou'se , suh . Ev'body knows dat . Ev'body knows you goan ' mah'y Miss Win'fed . " " Who do you mean by everybody ? " " Why , suh , people I lives wid at . Footsman at school . Man as keeps awster booth at cohner . Ev'body , suh . " " I always found you a good judge of things , Noel , and that 's why I 'm asking you these questions . How do you think Mr. Ballard is feeling ? Does he seem angry ? " " No , Mist ' Ju ' . I hears ' im talk to Miss Win'fed . They 's laff plen'y , Mist ' Ju ' . " Julian declined to accept this optimistic view . " He wo n't laugh when I get there . That 's when the trouble will start . " " No , suh . He no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' trub ' . He keep Miss Win'fed out sight . He no let big roostah see nice lil lady hug . " The host of the Royal Kent Arms called to a passing waiter , " Here you are , Jonas , show this gent to seventeen . " Julian knocked on the panel of room seventeen with a trepidation which Noel 's words had done nothing to allay . A deep voice , which he recognized as that of Timothy Ballard , answered from within : " Come in ! Do n't stand there knocking ! " Timothy Ballard was sitting in a creaky armchair and it seemed on first glance that he was frowning in a most formidable way . Julian had no chance to form a definite conclusion on that point , however , for Winifred rose from a chair at the other side of the room and came over to greet him . It might even be said that she ran , for certainly she used up little time in reaching him . She threw her arms around his neck . " Oh , darling ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's happy about it . " She gave her arms a tug to bring his ear closer to her mouth . " Do you hear what I 'm saying , my tall , wonderful husband-to-be ? Do n't you feel likep347shouting ? Are you glad ? Are you still in love with me ? Papa 's going to let me marry you . And I love you , I love you , I love you ! " Her father had risen from his chair and gone to one of the windows so that his back was turned to them . " I 'll be glad to shake your hand , Mr. Grace , " he said , " when my daughter has stopped monopolizing you . But of course there 's no hurry about it . None at all . " " I 'm happy to see you , sir , " said Julian . " But I do n't mind saying , sir , that I came in fear and trembling . I thought you were going to  --  to cast me into outer darkness . " " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can wait . We have so very , very many things to tell each other . " In course of time the three of them sat down together around a table which a waiter was preparing for a midday meal . The latter had already whisked the chenille cover off and replaced it with a linen tablecloth . NeitherJulian nor Winifred had any idea how long it had been . Mr. Ballard had known to a second . It had been eleven minutes and forty seconds , and he had remained patiently all that time at the window , watching two men in the street below quarrel over a dog . " I heard my daughter say to you , my boy , that I do n't object , " said TimothyBallard , studying a bottle of wine which the waiter had deposited on the table . " That is not exactly accurate . As soon as the letters arrived I sat down and wrote one in which I poured out all the first objections and reservations they had roused in me . But when her mother and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't object to the marriage as much as I thought at first . So , instead of writing a letter , I caught the first boat for England  --  and here I am . " " When did you arrive , sir ? " Timothy Ballard seemed happy to answer this question . In fact he quite perceptibly puffed out his chest as he said it was five days since he had reached the city . " You see , my boy , " he explained , " I 'm a believer in thoroughness . There were many things I had to do , and many questions I had to ask , before I could talk to you . For instance , I went into Berkshire and saw your father and mother . We had several long talks . I liked them very much and I am perhaps fatuous enough to believe that they liked me . Your father and I agreed on many points and he is not more than an inch or so taller than I am . I felt very comfortable with him and I can understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House . They took me over to see the Duke of Outland , who spoke of you most glowingly . For some reason he seemed inclined to refer to you as jasper . " " He had a younger brother named Jasper who went out and took up land in Canada . "  | " His mistake was due , I 'm sure , to his advancing years and not to any lack of knowledge of your name . Need I tell you , my boy , that your parentsare well disposed to the match ? Although , of course , they have n't seen Winifred yet . I showed them a miniature of her which a colored artist in Kingston had painted  --  a really remarkable fellow . They were quite carried away by it . " " When they see Winifred , sir , " declared Julian , " they will capitulate instantly , if they have n't already done so . " " I took the liberty of ordering the roast beef for all of us , " said Mr. Ballard as the waiter began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef on the island that I 've been devoting myself to it ever since I arrived . Ah , I see they have a steamed suet pudding instead of the Yorkshire . A sound combination . " He returned to the recital of the affairs which had kept him busy since his arrival . " I went also to the Admiralty and there I saw both Sir Reginald Fettery and Sir Mainwaring Grant . Each of them gave a warm report of you . " You will both be surprised , I think , to know that I 've paid a visit to the little house they call Santa Cruz . It 's not exactly what I would like for you but it 's more or less an official matter , I judge . It may even be that you get it rent-free . " " No , sir . They do n't go that far . " " Well , it may do for a while , " said Ballard with a rather pompous air . " Not for very long , " contributed Winifred . " I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of children . The house has n't room for more than one . " Having reached this stage in his story , Timothy Ballard seemed almost ready to burst with satisfaction over the accomplishment he proceeded to explain . " I thought of that , " he declared . " The little house will do for a year but probably not a day longer . I 've already found the ideal home for you . " Winifred looked up quickly and rather anxiously . " Where , Papa , where ? " " I do n't mean a residence in the city . The important thing is to have a place in the county . I saw the perfect house when I went out to see your parents , my boy . It 's not more than six miles from where they live . On the Thames but on an elevation which keeps it dry . The gardens run down to the water where there 's a pier and a boathouse . It 's Georgian , red brick , two stories high only , with charming wings , a parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome library and the books go with it  --  and a dining room and nice little studies , one for each of you . There 's a garden , enclosed in a brick wall , stables and a fine stand of trees . Oak and elm , mostly . " Both the young people were breathing excitedly.  | " It sounds much too large for us , " said Julian in a reluctant state of doubt . " I think it sounds fascinating , " declared Winifred . " When can we look at it , Papa ? " " Any time at all , dear children , " answered her father . " I bought it at once . " They began then to talk about the immediate future . The planter explainedthat he could remain until after they were married because Mrs. Ballard had gone to Barbados to visit relatives . Her health had been a little peaked , he said , and she had not felt equal to accompanying him , much as she had longed to come . Still , a short visit would do her good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new superintendent was handling everything in a most workmanlike way . Winifred looked up quickly . " Who is it , Papa ? " " Clingman Rade . You remember when I had him in charge of the sugar mill ? He ran it better than I could myself . So a short time ago I switched him to the rice paddies and he did just as well there . You see , my child , he has colored blood in him and so he understands the men working under him . " There was a long silence . It was clear that Winifred was worried . " Papa , I do n't agree with what you 've done . I never liked Clingman Rade . " Her father laughed easily . " Why not , my small one ? As I say , he 's capable and he knows his place --  " " I 'm not sure he does . There was always a look in his eye I did n't like . Papa , I dreaded the sight of his feet . They were so large and broad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted them down  --  anywhere , in a doorway , in a room , in a position of trust  --  nothing would ever move them . You know , Papa , he did put those feet of his in other men 's doorways . " " I 've talked to him about that . No more philandering , I said . He had to leave the wives alone and not have his men hating him and waiting for a chance to cut his throat with a hatchet . He promised . I have every confidence in him now . " His daughter was still far from content but she said nothing more . The meal progressed to a steamed pudding which caused the planter to roll his eyes toward the ceiling . Then came a final course , consisting of a sharp cheese with apples . It was not until all their appetites had been satisfied that Timothy Ballard settled back in his chair and began to talk . " The whole face of life is changing , my dear young people . Perhaps I 'm better able to see it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my last visit I found London full of redcoats and I heard fifes and drums every/where . It was all war then . The press gangs still roamed the streets and picked up men for the navy . Would you believe it that a pair got hold of me one night ? " He looked a little sheepish at making this confession . " I 'd gone out for a stroll alone after attending a dinner of bankers . The dinner had been a good one and I was hardly able to defend myself when a pair of them swooped on me with their swords out . They dragged me to the inn where the bosun in command was having a jovial evening . I fairly blasted him and he took one look at me and said to them , Lumme , ye 've thrown your net over a queer fish this time . ' He realized the magnitude of their mistake when I told him who I was . I was apologized to handsomely and asked to overlook it . And one of my captors went along to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why , Papa , I 've never heard you tell about that . " " My child , I 'm not particularly proud of it and I do n't enjoy telling about anything as cruel as this . They call the country a democracy and yet they send out ruffianly sailors to seize young fellows with honest employment and perhaps wives and children , and put them into the navy . They put them into hell holes and beat them unmercifully for any mistakes . They feed them on wormy bread and nauseous salt pork . " There are no press gangs at the moment , " he went on , " although another war would bring them out . But the point I started to make is how vastly England has changed . I have n't seen a redcoat since I reached London . I do n't hear a word about war or the Battle of Waterloo or Nelson . It 's all trade and commerce now . Everything I hear has to do with building railroadsand launching steamships and raising new factories . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's hard to tell . At the moment there 's more interest in this Samuel Carboy than in the old Iron Duke . That worries me . " This morning I took a turn in St. James 's Park and I saw a tall young fellow with black curls sticking out from under the tallest silk hat ever worn on a human head . He had a monocle and a collar which hid his ears . His coat was fawn and hung almost to his knees . His trousers were so baggy he could have stuck both legs into one and the cloth was a glaring bottle blue . What 's more , he was wearing spurs though I think he 's probably never been on a horse in his life . That sort of thing worries me too . " Winifred had been listening although her eyes had never left Julian 's face . " But , Papa , " she asked , " life has n't changed in the important things , has it ? People still fall in love and get married . And they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on in the outside world . . . . " Timothy Ballard smiled broadly . " I 'm going downstairs to attend to some matters of business . From the look on our young friend 's face , I can see he 's ready to answer your question . "  |p351Three  years had passed . Another fall had rolled around but it was not as bright and bountiful as the autumn when the news of Allie Carboy 's death had reached the Vale . It was a dark autumn , rainy and dank and decidedly unpleasant . The kind of winds which belonged by rights to winter were howling through Little Shallow and whistling about the stone walk at Beaulaw Hall where the ghost of someone 's wife or mistress or daughter ( no one was quite clear about this ) was supposed to issue forth at night . If the shade of the unfortunate lady was doing penance for some sin by flittingabout the courtyard , she was paying a high price for her wrongdoing in life . One Sunday Samuel Carboy had a group of business associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch and there was a curious collection of vehicles along the drive , including a stanhope which had a seat at least seven feet in the air . They had been given a fine meal and were emerging from the dining room with red faces and a general air of repletion when Fleck sidled up to his master 's shoulder and said in his ear , " A lady to see you , sir . " The great industrial leader had partaken of one drink of whisky too many . He looked at Fleck with a rather glassy eye . " A lady ? How in thunderation did she get here ? " " She got off the Lunnon coach at Wantage and had herself driven over , sir . She has a boy with her . " " I ca n't imagine who it is . What name did she give , Fleck ? " The butler hesitated . " She says , sir , that her name is Mrs. Alfred Carboy . " The head of the house might be a step over the line from sobriety but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to grasp the full significance of this announcement . " Ah ! So that 's it ! Well , it was to be expected . " He paused and frowned thoughtfully . Then his eyes came back to Fleck with a fierce intentness . " What did you say , Fleck ? A boy ? Good gad , I did n't expect that . " Another pause . " Fleck , take the lady and the boy to my study . I 'll be there directly . " When Carboy reached the study , after settling his guests elsewhere andp352seeing them well supplied with everything they might need in the line of drinks , he found the woman who called herself his son 's widow sitting near the window and looking out into the drizzle . A boy of perhaps three stood beside her . He was dressed in a velvet suit and was wearing a blue bow tie and trim leather shoes laced up over his ankles and tied with tasseled laces ; a very nice-looking little boy indeed , with light hair and blue eyes . All Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was small , with red hair , which had once been more red and more vibrant , and a pert face . He was surprised to note that she was quietly dressed in dark blue and was wearing a hat that could be described almost as prim . Her skirts , which were so full that they spread out as wide as a peacock 's tail , did not permit as much as the point of a shoe to show . " The butler tells me , " said Carboy , " that you gave him the name of Mrs. Alfred Carboy . That means you are the widow of my son . Or that you say you are his widow . " Emmy had been dreading this interview with her father-in-law . Allie 's references to his father had left the impression of a household tyrant who demanded his own way in everything , a family ogre , in fact . She looked up at Samuel Carboy , who had drawn in his lips and was watching her with hostile eyes , and decided that the picture had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were married , Mr.  --  Mr. Carboy , " she said . " He wrote to his mother about me . " " Yes . I saw the letter . " " He wrote twice . I wanted him to do it oftener but he would promise me and then not do it . " She hesitated . " No one ever wrote to me . " " Certainly not . You may be sure we did n't approve of what he had done . We were informed later of his  --  of his death . " Carboy was almost as ill at ease as she was . He kept moistening his lips and his eyes seldom met hers . " You have brought your proofs , of course ? " " Proofs , Mr. Carboy ? What proofs do I need ? Everyone in the company will tell you that we were married , and so will the minister who performed the ceremony , and his wife and daughter . We gave a little supper after  --  just sandwiches and beer and a beautiful cake  --  and we invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a very nice piece about it in the paper the next day . Do I need any other proofs , Mr.  --  Mr. Carboy ? " " I was not a member of the company , " declared the magnate . " The ministeris thousands of miles away , no doubt . I did not go to the supper . I did not partake of the sandwiches or the beer or the cake . I did not read the piece in the paper . You may be Alfred 's widow or you may not . How can I be sure unless you can show me your marriage certificate ? "  |p353Emmy  was very much disturbed . She placed an arm around the small boy 's shoulder and drew him closer to her . " I had a marriage certificate , Mr. Carboy . And a birth certificate for little Sammy --  " " Who ? " demanded Carboy . " Who did you say ? " " My little son . I named him after you , Mr. Carboy , because my Alfie always said he wanted the child named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promised him before he died and I lived up to it , though I do n't like the name , and never did . " Carboy was studying the boy without any indication of a more friendly feeling toward him . The child looked at him once , a level glance from his large blue eyes , and then lowered his head . The scrutiny of this old man was making him very uneasy , it was clear . " You brought no papers with you , then ? " " No , sir . No , Mr. Carboy . " Emmy suddenly drew herself up indignantly . " And supposing I did n't ? Does that make any difference ? It 's no crime to forget where you put papers , especially when you 're on the road and moving every day , or nearly every day . I do n't suppose you 've ever been with a road company , Mr. Carboy , but I want to tell you that after weeks of packingsand unpackings you just throw things into your bag and buckle it tight . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way ? " " There are some papers one never loses , my girl , " declared Carboy . He was saying to himself that her neglect to bring the usual documents was suspicious in the extreme . She might be as careless as she made out but what she had said sounded like a cock-and-bull story . At the same time , he had to confess to himself that she was not as bad personally as might have been expected . She was quiet in both manner and dress . Her voice was not good , of course , but what could you expect of an American ? " You want me to believe that this is Alfred 's son and to accept him as such ? " " He is Alfie 's son ! " cried the mother . " Are you trying to put a slur on my character ? " " No , no ! " said Carboy hastily . " How old is the boy ? " " He was born two months after his father died . And he 's been such a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a home , Mr. Carboy . I 've been on the road from the time he was a month old . He has to sit in a hotel room all day long and I take him to the theater at night and put him in the wings . He never complains or makes a noise , the little pet . I was very extravagant to get him a velvet suit and cap but I wanted him to make a good impression . " " You have no proofs of his parentage and so I 'm telling you candidly I have my doubts about all this . The boy does n't look at all like my son Alfred.  |p354I  've been watching him and I have n't detected a single point of resem-blance . " Emmy 's face had become flushed with resentment . She got to her feet and faced this man she knew to be her father-in-law but who seemed determined to repudiate her and her son . " He may not look like his father now but I hope he will later because my Alfie was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good look at him , you 'll see that he resembles you , more 's the pity ! " Despite a rather startled moment of close scrutiny , Carboy failed to detectany resemblance in the now very much embarrassed boy . Young Samuelwas refusing to look up and was limiting himself to the study of a very small segment of carpet . With an air of sudden impatience , Carboy reached over and pulled the bell cord . " Fleck , " he said when the butler appeared , " will you ask Mrs. Carboy to come down ? " In the few minutes which elapsed Samuel Carboy gave some serious thought to the situation . It was quite possible , he conceded , that the girl would turn out to be his son 's widow . She seemed to fit the description they had received and it was clear she belonged on the stage . On the other hand he had been finding it continuously necessary to raise his defenses against the demands made on him . He was already being called publicly the richest man in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mutton bone . They pestered him on the streets , they climbed on the steps of his carriage and thrust their faces in at him with every kind of demand . Veterans in rags claimed to have fought at Waterloo and armless sailors swore to have seen Nelson fall at Trafalgar . He received scores of letters a day , begging , whining , demanding , threatening . How could he be sure this was anything more than a phase of the daily pattern ? " Tell me this , " he said abruptly . " Why did you wait so long ? My son has been dead for three years . " Emmy had been thinking also and was on the point of an outburst of tears over the kind of reception she was receiving . She had been so sure that her little son , looking so fine in his expensive velvets , would win the hearts of the grandparents at once . There was a new vehemence in her reply , becauseof this , while she dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " It takes more money to cross the ocean than I can make in a year . It was only because Igot this chance to appear at a London theater that I could afford to come . " " You 're playing in London now ? " " Yes . At the Criterion . " " Oh . You 're that one . I saw the billing . They call you  --  let me think , thep355Scintillating Salome and the Lissome Lilliom . " His frown grew dark and heavy . " They tell me , young woman , that your act is disgraceful . You appearin almost nothing and display your body to the gaze of the idle and vulgar . " " That 's not true ! " cried Emmy . Her red hair seemed to bristle , her eyes flashed angrily . " It 's true I wear tights but that 's nothing new . Breeches girls have appeared on the stage in tights for centuries . " " I do n't consider that an excuse . " Fleck returned at this point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her maid refused to have her disturbed . She has not been at all well today , sir . " " She must n't be disturbed . But let me know when she wakens , Fleck . " Carboy began then to pace up and down the room , frowning uncertainly . It was clear that he was finding it hard to decide on the proper course to pursue . " This is the most disorganized human being I 've ever encountered , " he said to himself . " I ca n't believe Alfred would have fallen so low . " Finally he came to a stop in front of the boy . " Well , young man , " he said , " and what 's your name ? " The boy had sensed that this ugly man was angry with his mother and he did not raise his eyes . " Sa  --  Sa  --  Samuel , sir . " " How old are you ? " " I 'm nearly three , sir . " " You 're a small boy for three . When I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you swing an ax around your head ? " " I  --  I do n't think so , sir . " " Where do you live ? " " On the road , sir . We are always on the road . " " Do you think your mother is a good actress ? " " Oh yes , sir . My mother is lovely . " " Do you remember your father ? " " No , sir . My father is dead . " " What was his name ? " " Alfred , sir . " " Where were you born ? " " I do n't know , sir . " The boy had continued to keep his head averted . Carboy put a hand under his chin and turned his face up so that he could study it . " You 're a good enough looking young fellow , " he commented . Turningtoward Emmy , he asked , " How does it happen he has such good manners ? " " He must have been born with them , " declared Emmy , giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got them from me . " Her temper flaredp356up . " I have no manners . I 'm just a cheap little actress , and an American to make it worse . But let me tell you this , Mr. Samuel Carboy , my manners are as good as yours . You 're a horrible , cruel man ! You 're just as mean as my poor Alfie said you were . " Samuel Carboy became angry in turn . " Now you listen to me , young woman . Do n't you suppose I would be happy to know that my son , the only one I had , left a son to take his place ? Nothing would make me happier . I would be quick to claim him , to receive him into the family and to figure that in time he would follow in my footsteps . There 's nothing I would like better than to believe this young codger is my grandson . " He turned and scowled at her . " But how can you expect me to believe your story ? You come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never had a line from you in all that time , not even an announcement of his birth . You do n't come direct to us . You go into a London theater and make a spectacle of yourself . Finally you come down here , bringing a boy with you . You have n't a scrap of paper to prove who you are or to back up your story . You 're most conveniently vague about everything . And the boy does n't look to me to have as much as a drop of Carboy blood in his veins . " It comes down to this , " he continued . " I ca n't accept you at face value . Suppose I did and it turned out later you were an impostor , and the real widow came along ! That would be a pretty fix , would n't it ? Well , here 's what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to start an investigation over there at once . I suppose it should have been done before but somehow I 've overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and we 'll get at the facts in no time at all . We should have all the facts in a few weeks . " " Do n't you intend to do something at once for your grandson ? " " I intend to do nothing for him until I know he is my grandson . I have a decided aversion to being taken in . " Emmy 's reddish-brown eyes were growing redder as her resentment mounted . " Then you expect me to support him in the meantime by continuingmy  --  my disgraceful performance on the stage ? " This was a poser . Carboy gave the point careful consideration before answering . " I think I see a way to make a test out of this . If your son is my Alfred 's boy , we could n't have you appearing on the stage . You know what the truth is ; and so , if you keep on playing , it will be an indication to me that you do n't expect the report from America to be in your favor . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and live on the small allowance I 'll make you temporarily  --  and it will be a bare subsistence , because I wo n't allow myself to be imposed on  --  I 'll feel reasonably certain you 've been telling the truth . " " And if I accept this allowance , where are we to live ? "  | " Wherever you like , except that you 're to keep out of sight . I make that a positive condition . " " And what will happen when your lawyers find that I am Emmy Sweet , that my little boy is your grandson , that everything I 've told you is true ? " " Your son will be acknowledged at once as my grandson and as my ultimate heir . " " And what about me ? " Carboy made an impatient gesture . " How can I tell at this point ? It would depend on so many things . Oh , you would be looked after , of course . That goes without saying . " " I would have to give up the stage ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to go on any longer . " " You might even prefer me to return to the United States and leave my son in your care . " " Perhaps . It would depend , I think , on whether Mrs. Carboy liked you or not . " " I do n't believe , Mr. Carboy , that you like me . " " No . I 'm always frank . I do n't like you . " " In fact you would be ashamed to have me around as a daughter-in-law . " " If the occasion ever arises for me to feel that way , " declared Carboy , " you will have yourself to blame . What you are doing  --  all this prancing and kickingand flaunting of yourself  --  will be hard to live down . In fact I 'm sure you will always be remembered as the  --  the Scintillating Salome . " " That 's all I need to know . " Emmy got to her feet and took her son 's hand in hers . " Come on , sonny . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Will they have four horses ? " " I expect so . You take after your father , do n't you ? He always liked horses . " " I 'll hear from you of course , " said Carboy indifferently . " No . You 'll never hear from me again . As soon as the run is over I 'm returning to the United States . " Carboy indulged in a broad grin . " The test seems to have worked , " he said . There were foreign faces in the group Carboy was entertaining and at this point the possessor of a visage which suggested middle Europe appeared in the door . Behind him was a short and very stout man with a fringe of red hair clinging in tight curls around the bald dome of his head , none other than Baron Menzies , a prominent figure in the industrial world . " Carboy , " said Menzies , giving a twirl to the beaver hat he held in his hand , " Princep and I want a word with you . In private , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " began the foreigner . Carboy winked at him and inclined his head in Fmmv 's direction . " I have company , Prin . But the lady is going at once . " Emmy crossed the floor , leading her small son by the hand . The man with the red curls and the bald head recognized her and gave a pleased nod.  | " I 've seen you , young woman . In a play in London . You 're a dancer . And a very good one . " Emmy strove to answer in a properly dignified tone . " I 'm glad you liked our play . " " Oh , it was you I liked rather than the play . How you kicked ! I did n't recognize you at first because of the  --  he , he !  --  the long skirt you 're wearing . " Emmy 's temper began td assert itself . " Sir , " she said , " will you do me a favor ? " The stout man nodded his head emphatically . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you a favor . Anything  --  within reason , of course . " " Please hold your hat up as high as you can . " The financier giggled and lifted his hat in the air . Emmy took her skirts in both hands and raised them above her knees , thereby proving that everything in the way of praise which had been lavished on the share of her anatomy thus revealed had been in the nature of understatement . The man named Princep whistled loudly and the stout Englishman 's eyes rolled in their sockets . Carboy was hunting for some papers on his desk and did not notice . Raising herself on one toe , the dancer from the United States flashed upward with her other leg and sent the hat flying right to the ceiling . " Brava ! " cried the foreigner . " Now I call that kicking , " commented the Englishman , " though I 'm sorry it had to be my hat . It 's a new one . " " There , Mr. Carboy , " said Emmy , " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't I ? Not that I care , Mr. Carboy . What I 've done expresses my feeling about you and your family and your friends , and the whole English public for that matter . " Emmy led her son from the room . " The toe of my boot to the lot of you , " she said . News has a way of circulating quickly in the country districts and it was not long before word reached the Groody shop of what had happened . It was an exaggerated version which was poured into their ears by a domestic from Beaulaw Hall who had kept up an acquaintance with Mrs. Groody . " Mr. Carboy ordered her out of the house , saying as it was plain she was telling nothing but a pack of lies . The hussy said she would n't go . She said he would hear from the prisidint of the U-nited States about the wayp360he was treating her and there might be trouble atween the two countries . And she kicked the hat off the head of one of his guests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the head . I did n't set eyes on the creature but I got a glimpse of the boy in the hall and I must say he seemed a very nice and quiet little kincher . " The reference to the boy was all that Nell believed . When the visitor had gone , she sought out her father , who was enjoying a pipe in a rocking chair back of the house . " Get yourself ready , " she said . " We 're going to London , you and I. There 's just time to catch the afternoon coach . " Neither of them had been in the great city before and they were very much excited by their first glimpse of it . They arrived late at night , however , and so they missed seeing London in its picturesque daytime mien . The streets were dark and seemed like a succession of yawning holes into which it would be dangerous to venture . The massiveness of the place caused them to wonder if they would ever be able to find their way out again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundredfold more mystifying than the minotaur 's lair . The incessant noises of the day were not in evidencebut the dark city could not be called silent . It rumbled and growled and muttered about them , and each deserted mews seemed alive . Fortunatelythe stars were out and they caught sudden glimpses which caused Nell to grasp her father 's arm in ecstatic interest ; the dome of St. Paul 's , the bridges arching out over the river , the gloomy turrets of palaces , the foursquaremenace of the White Tower . The latter caused Daniel Groody to say , " It 's a smell of blood I 'm getting , and plenty of it Irish . " The theater was dark but a uniformed runner happened along and advised them to try an inn in the neighborhood , the Cibber Arms . Here they were given rooms and told that all members of the Criterion company were stayingthere . " Is there a Miss Sweet ? " asked Nell . " The dancer ? She 's here , with her son . They say , " in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurl . It might be , the way the nerbility hangs around the opery houses these days . She 's in sixty-two . " It happened that the Boots had not visited the east corridor and there were shoes of all sizes , shapes and conditions outside the doors . At sixty-two there was a pair with tasseled draws which had been made for a boy of three or thereabouts . " The little faller puts ' em out every night , " said the waiter who was escorting them to their rooms . " And he 's allus up and peeking out the door when Boots brings ' em back in the morning . Boots says the boy 's smirk is as good as the tuppence he does n't get from ' em . "  |p361Nell  stopped and looked down at the tiny shoes . Then she dropped on one knee and touched them with trembling fingers . " The nice little boy , " she said to herself . " I love him already . I 'm certain he 's Allie 's son . How sad that Allie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags had been deposited in their rooms and the waiter had been tipped ( Nell attended to this , as her father believed only in incoming tips ) , Nell followed him out into the corridor . " Where would I find Boots ? " she asked , offering him an additional sixpennypiece . The man pocketed the coin . " I hears his step now , miss . He 'll be in ap362veecious mood , ' cause the house is full and he 'll have more'n enough to do ; and from my sizing up o ' the guests , it 's little he 'll get in the way o ' tips . " Nell confronted the Boots some distance down the corridor where he was marking numbers on the soles of shoes with chalk . " Mr. Boots , have you the boy 's shoes from number sixty-two ? " The man squinted at her and said in a grumpy tone : " In course , miss . I gets ' em every night . They 're not easy , cause I ca n't get a hand inside ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shillings ? " Boots stared at Nell . He was not accustomed , apparently , to dealing in such astronomical figures . " ' Ow many o ' the guests is to be choked in their blooming beds wi ' pillers , miss ? " he asked . " I want you to bring that little boy 's shoes up to my room , seventy-two . Bring brush and polish with you . I want to do the shoes myself . " " For a shilling more , I 'll let you polish all of these , even including your own , miss . If it 's polishing you 've got your mind set on . " Nell was so deft and careful that she finished the tiny shoes without getting a single stain on her fingers . Perhaps she regretted this and would have been glad to have polish smudges to wash from her hands . There was a tear in the corner of each eye as she handed the shoes out the door to the waiting Boots . " I 'm sure he 's a very nice boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young'un . A nevvy , perhaps . " Nell shook her head . " No . I 've never seen him . Is he a nice-looking little boy ? " " Nice enough , miss , as young varmints goes . He 's a towheaded boy . " " Of course , " commented Nell in a breathless tone . " No in course ' bout it , miss . The mother 's as redheaded as a parrot . " " But his father was fair . Very fair , Mr. Boots . And very tall . " " Ah ! " said Boots with a knowing nod of his head . " Well , it 's the easiest two bob I 've ever made . I hopes you visits us offen , miss , and that you allus wants to take the job off'n my hands . And I 'll have nought to say to the young varmint 's mother about this . " " Please do n't , Mr. Boots . " Nell saw Emmy Sweet the next afternoon . It was a matinee day and the little dancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and beautifully lithe in the very shortest of skirts and the very tightest of stockings . " You wanted to see me ? " she asked , looking Nell over with a surprised air . It was a warm afternoon and the grease paint glistened on her cheeks and forehead.  | " Yes , " said Nell , whose eyes had been in danger of popping right out of their sockets at all the strange things she had been seeing . A tall man walking on stilts had been the last to enchain her attention . " My name is Nell Groody . I knew your husband although I do n't suppose he ever spoke of me . " " Oh , you 're her . " Emmy 's interest was aroused at once . " Of course he spoke of you . He made no bones about it at all . He told me how much he 'd been in love with you . I 'm sure he always liked you better than any of the rest of them . " " The rest of them ! " Nell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Groody . Allie bowled them over . Not his fault , perhaps , though he was never one to run away from them . There was the princess , of course . And there was the Divine Cordelia , the painted old cradle snatcher ! I watched her mooning over him . And there was Miss Violet Nash , who swooned away in the front row of the pit , and the veterinary 's daughter , who sent him notes every day . " She became aware that she was making her visitor unhappy with this recital of Allie Carboy 's triumphs . She adopted a new tack . " Oh , Allie could n't help it . He was born to be adored by women . Switch me , if I did n't nearly go into a swoon myself the first time I set eyes on him . But I 'll say this in all honesty , Nell Groody . I think he liked you better than all the rest of them . Even including me , perhaps . " Nell 's heart began to thump exultantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember it always , and draw upon it when she was low in mind . Allie had loved her . He had always kept her in his mind . He had preferred her even to the woman he had married . " I want to have a talk with you , " said Nell when she found it possible to speak . " Could you have tea with my father and me after the matinee ? We 're staying at the same inn . Number seventy and seventy-two . I 'll go back now and see about having a very good tea , if you 'll oblige me by coming . " " Why , yes . It 's very kind of you . " " And bring your son , please . " " Of course . But he 's a great eater . A regular little stuffer , that one . When he gets the chance , that is . " " And , " added Nell breathlessly , " thanks for what you told me ! Thank you a thousand times ! You were very kind and generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success from every standpoint . As soon as Nell saw the boy entering the room with slow steps and clinging to his mother 's hand , she knew that he was Allie 's son . It was a resemblance which required an eye for small likenesses , the variations of the line of the mouth , a flash of expression in the eyes , the tilt of the nose when glimpsed at a certain angle , the unmistakable fact that there was a touch of Samuel Carboy in the shape of his head ; this all added up to a feeling of certainty about him . " Well , Sammy , " she said , shaking his hand , " I 'm glad to see you . I think that velvet suit is a very nice one . " The boy looked down as he answered , " Yes , ma'am . It 's nice . A boy in Buffalo was in a box with a  --  a --  " " A governess , " prompted his mother . " Yes . And he wore one like it . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmy , " that he would like one . I had to visit half a dozen shops in New York to get it . And , whew , was it expensive ! " The tea turned out to be a most substantial meal , planned around a large capon which had been roasted brown and crisp . The boy did not take his eyes off it from the moment it was placed on the table and Nell said to herselfshe would never forget the look of pleasure he showed when a whole drumstick was put on his plate . " May I eat it all ? " he asked his mother . " If you 've got the room for it . " It was soon apparent that he had the room for it . He made quick dispatch of the drumstick and then turned his attention to the prawns . It was clear he had never tasted them before , because he emitted an exclamation of startled delight at the first taste . " Just one more , " said his mother hastily . When he had taken the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the table . " I do n't want you doubling up with pain in the wings while I 'm smiling away at the audience and trying to make them like me . Which is hard enough to begin with , because English people do n't seem to follow my way of speaking . " " How long are you staying in London ? " asked Nell . " The show closes in two weeks . I 'll have my passage back paid  --  that was in the contract . Then , I guess , I 'll have to go on the road again . "  | " Do you plan to take your son with you when you go out on the road ? " " What else can I do ? " Nell had been watching the boy with a longing to take him into her heart which amazed her by its overwhelming force . " It 's not a good thing for a boy his age , " she said . " Is there no family which might take him for a while ? " Emmy gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . And from what I remember of them , I would n't trust a chipmunk into their keeping . No , Nell "  --  they had reached the use of first names already  --  " I 'll just have to take him along and make things as comfortable for him as I can . " While they talked Nell never took her eyes from the boy . She was now observing with delight the avidity he was displaying in his attack on a bun , a very fancy bun with icing on top and raisins and nuts all the way through . " He wo n't be as handsome as Allie when he grows up , " she was thinking , but perhaps it 's just as well . It does n't do for men to be too handsome . " Suddenly she found herself putting into words the thought which had been in her mind from the first moment she had seen the small shoes in the hall of the hotel . " Leave him with me for a while . Until you get sufficiently established and wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with one of the good New York companies soon , I expect . " Emmy seemed doubtful of the chance of becoming established in New York . " They take to me more on the road , " she said . " The reviewer in Utica wrote a poem in praise of  --  well , what I dance with . It was quite a cute poem . I get good notices all the way out to Louisville and as far south as Richmond . But I do n't seem to do well in New York . To be perfectly honest , I did n't do very well here . " She looked at her son , who was finishing his meal with a glass of milk . " Young man , what would you think of staying for a while with the pretty lady ? " Daniel Groody had been following the talk with an eager interest in his sharp dark eyes . He decided now to take a hand in it . " It 's been in my mind , child , " he said , addressing Nell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little shop should be used for business only . Now there 's the Old Rectory . I hear the Reverend is going to live in Carnwood and the old place will be looking for tenants . My head is n't one for figures and it 's mixed up I get when there 's talk of money . But you have a way , child , of forking out whatever we need in that line . If we took the Rectory , it 's a fine stable it has . We could keep old Barney there . And if the boy should come to visit us , I know where a pony could be got for a trifle . " " A pony ? " There was an ecstatic note in the boy 's voice . " Yes , sir , a pony . An Irish pony , bedad . A black little fellow with just ap366smidgin of white on his nose . And such a tail ! You 've never seen the like of that tail . " The boy was listening to the Irishman with fascinated absorption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , " said Daniel Groody , " we 'd have the looking after of him , you and me . We 'd feed him and put the currycomb on him and take him out for runs around the yard . And you could sit on his back and get the feel of riding in your hands and knees . In another year I think it 's old enough you 'd be and strong enough to start riding him . " The boy had been giving thought to the drumstick and the prawns and the rich bun , and now he was thinking with a wild surge of interest of the pony . He turned to his mother . " If you think I might , Mother . If you would n't mind , I 'd like to stay for a while with the nice lady and the nice man  --  and the pony . " With an approving eye , Daniel Groody watched the boy as he attended to his black pony . " Git the little fella good and dry , " he said . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look after Turk well . Turk 's a fine pony . He 's the best pony in the world , is n't he ? " " Well , now , in the whole world , you say ? Well , now , that 's going it a bit . But Turk 's a good pony , right enough . " " I 'll be glad when I 'm big enough to ride real horses . But I 'll always like Turk as much as I do now . Is he to be allowed oats tonight ? " " It 's meself will attend to the feeding of him . " Groody broke off and looked apprehensively in the direction of the main road curving down through Little Shallow . " It 's him ! Your grandfather . Look at the way that Humpster is driving ! It must be the devil 's coattails they 're trying to catch . " The boy walked to the door of the stables and looked up the road . " My grandfather always drives fast , " he said . There was a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , do you think ? " " If he is , it 'll be to get you , " declared Groody . He looked down at thep367intent face of the boy . " Is it thinking ye are that ye 'd like to go and live with him ? " " No ! " cried Sammy . " I 'd rather stay here . With Turk and you and Aunt Helen and Mrs. Groody . I like it here . " " Then I 'll tell you what it is , young fella . You 'd better get up and hide in the haymow . If he comes for ye and he asks me where ye are , I 'll say ye 've gone away . I 'll say ye 've gone on a long churney all by yerself . To France or Egypt or Prushia . " " Tell him , " said the boy , with his foot on the first step of the ladder leading up to the fragrant blackness of the haymow , " that I went to America like my father did . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Rectory . Samuel Carboy stepped down , followed by Jonathan Bade , the latter with a wellstuffedbarrister 's bag over his shoulder . The titan looked up at the welllightedrooms of the square old house and then took in the activity at the stables . " Horses eating their heads off , " he muttered . " Candles burning away at a ruinous rate . How does she manage it , Jonathan ? " " She 's a clever woman , . Samuel . She doubles her money every time she forks over for something . I tell you , Samuel , she 's got the Midas touch too . " Nell received them in the room she used as an office . She had been working at her books and correspondence for hours but she looked as neat and fresh as though she had been doing nothing more taxing than lifting a teacup . Carboy looked at her and noted , perhaps for the first time , the deep blue of her eyes and the striking effect of the single white lock in her black hair . " The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nell knew the errand on which they had come and her heart threatened to stop . She said , with trembling lips , " You 've heard from America ? " Carboy nodded . " That Sweet woman was telling the truth . It 's galling to admit it because I 've always prided myself on knowing the spurious article from the real . I thought she was lying . " He turned to the lawyer . " Explain things , Jonathan . " Jonathan Bade seated himself at the table and began to draw documents from his bag . " Our correspondents in New York have sent us the facts , Miss Groody , " he said . " It 's taken them a long time but they 've finally got through with it . Here we are  --  the affidavits from members of the theatrical company about the marriage , the birth certificate of the boy , the death certificate of Alfred Carboy . Everything is in order . " Nell looked up quickly . " Everything ? " she asked . " Well , practically everything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bade . But we 'll speak of that later . "  |p368Carboy  looked at her suspiciously . " It 's good enough for me . I 'm satisfied with the evidence . " " There 's plenty at any rate , " declared the lawyer , " to prove that the boy is the son of the late Alfred Carboy and the grandson of my client . " " Of course , " said Nell . " I knew that from the first . And little Sammy gets to look more like his father every day . " She turned to Samuel Carboy with sudden vehemence . " And now you 've come to claim him ! You want to take him away from me . " Carboy nodded . " Naturally . Now that I know he is my Alfred 's boy , l mean to see to his raising myself . That 's natural , is n't it ? " " Quite natural . I would n't expect you to feel any other way . But  --  but there are others to be considered too . " Carboy answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose . You 've got attached to the boy . " " I 'm so attached to him , " she cried , " that I 'll want to die when he has to leave me . As I know he will . But I meant his mother . She plans to send for him as soon as she 's in a position to look after him . " " That silly creature ! She 'll never be able to take . him . It 's more than likely you 'll never hear from her again . " " I 've had several letters from her . I like her and I 'm sure she means well . One came a fortnight ago . She 's still playing on the road  --  that means they go from town to town  --  and so there 's no chance that she 'll want him back soon . " She hesitated , as though doubtful of the advisability of giving further information . " I think she 's likely to marry again . To a member of the company . She acknowledged she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carboy gave his head a contemptuous toss . " Mark my words , that flutterheadwill have one husband after another . I would n't permit my grandson to be placed in her charge again . " " Indeed ? " Nell spoke in a rather incisive tone . " May I ask what you could do to prevent it ? " " How would I prevent it ? By due process of law , young woman . The law is very clear in giving children into the care of the father . I stand in this matter in lieu of my son . " Jonathan had been listening with some anxiety . At this point he deemed it wise to intervene . " There are points of law involved , Miss Groody . In a case of this kind it would not be hard for the grandfather , who is in a position to give the boy the best care and who moreover offers prospects for the future of the most substantial kind , to be awarded the custody . If he took the case to the Court of Chancery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the legal aspects and I do n't agree with you . As the father of the boy is dead , the mother has the guardianship in nurture . She has transferred that guardianship to me . " Samuel Carboy took a few steps which brought him closer to where she was sitting , and looked down at her ; " glared " would perhaps be a more accurate word , for the Colossus was becoming decidedly impatient . " You say she transferred the guardianship to you ? " " Yes , Mr. Carboy . That 's what I said . I stand in that relationship to your grandson until such time as she sends for him . " " Do you think that an English court of law would accept an arrangement between two foolish women in the face of my undoubted rights in the matter , and my capacity , and great desire , to do things for the boy ? The two of you reached a verbal agreement , no doubt . " - " No , Mr. Carboy . The two foolish women knew better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was towering over her as he spoke and his face had taken on a belligerent expression . " Just this . Your daughter-in-law went before a magistrate in London and swore out a paper , declaring her desires in the matter . The paper was duly witnessed and attested . " Carboy turned and looked questioningly at his lawyer . Jonathan gave his head a quick shake to indicate that his employer should now leave matters in his hands . " You have the paper , Miss Groody ? " " One copy . The other is in the mother 's hands . " " Was it her idea to have the document drawn up and signed ? " Nell gave her head a shake . " No , Mr. Bade . " Carboy could not restrain himself , in spite of the warning looks that Jonathan continued to send in his direction . " This is all due to your meddling , young woman ! " he exclaimed . " You were determined to get the boy into your hands . You brought him here to live with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your defiance of me in the face of the whole Vale . I knew what you were trying to do . You saw a chance to strike at us  --  at the parents of the man you wanted to marry . I 've known that right along . " Nell kept her composure in the face of this heated charge . " I took the boy , Mr. Carboy , " she said , " because otherwise his mother would have taken him back to America . You refused to do anything for them . Do you realize what kind of a life he would have lived there ? " She rose to her feet and faced him . Her color was high and her eyes were filled with defiance . " His mother would have taken him on the road with her . Traveling from town to town in drafty covered wagons . Living in cheap little inns . Spendingp370every evening in the wings of a theater . Never knowing the comforts of a home and having no chance to get an education . When you washed your hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to that kind of life . " Carboy realized that he had put himself in the wrong . He took another tack at once . " Overlook what I said . I 'm in an upset state of mind . And you must realize that I can do everything for him . He will live in the greatest luxury with us . I 'll engage a tutor at once for him . When he 's old enough he 'll go to one of the best public schools . Dammit , young woman , " becomingbelligerent again , " do n't you see that you ca n't stand in the boy 's way ? I intend to make him my heir . He 'll be a rich man , one of the richest in the world . You must be ready to give in for his sake . " " I 've had him with me now for nearly a year , " said Nell in a repressed tone . She was holding her head down to conceal the intensity of her feelings . " I love him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of standing in his way . I know only too well that he must go to you in time . I  --  I love him enough to step aside tonight and let you take him away . But I have n't the right to do that without his mother 's consent . That was a part of the agreement we signed ; because , you see , she thought you treated her badly . She was furious over the way you spoke to her . She said you 'd never get him . She still feels that way about it . And I must have her consent in writing . " " Humph ! That wo n't be hard to get . " The Colossus laughed easily . " I 'll buy her consent . I want the boy . He 's my grandson and he must be with us where he belongs . Now that I know he 's Allie 's son , nothing is going to stand in my way . I 'll have my New York lawyers see her at once and offer her enough to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Her letter reached me from Cincinnati . " " Never heard of the place . Where is it ? " Nell was thinking hard . " Little Sammy belongs with his own people . I must accept that fact sooner or later . But , oh , if I could only have him a little longer . I ca n't let him go yet . " " Well , young woman , where is this place you mentioned ? " " I think it 's many weeks ' travel from New York . It 's on a great river in the West . You have to go on horseback . " Carboy turned to Jonathan . " Could you persuade our New York man to ride that far ? " " From what I 've heard of Spurlock , I doubt it . He 's not young , you know , and he 's well provided with tallow around the waist . He likes his own bed and his fireside . A letter might get there as quickly as he would . " " I want quick action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months waiting for this silly creature 's signature . "  | " It 's hard to reach traveling companies by mail , " declared the lawyer . " They never stay long in any one place and they change their plans all the time . Letters seldom catch up with them . " " Then we 'll begin action at once to have this delegation of guardianship set aside , " said Carboy emphatically . Nell 's mood of reluctant compliance left her at this point . " I do n't think that would be wise , Mr. Carboy . A study of the documents might reveal something you would rather not have known . " " And what do you mean by that ? " Jonathan Bade raised a hand and shook it emphatically at his employer . Carboy said in a grumbling tone , " All right , you do the talking then . " " Miss Groody , " said the lawyer , " you have made a statement which will bear examination . Are you prepared to tell us what you did mean ? " Nell hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she declared , " when I say that I 'm thinking only of little Sammy and what is best for him . His mother said something which raised my suspicions . I questioned her about it and what she told me was quite  --  quite disturbing . " Jonathan knew what was coming . " We believe you , Miss Groody , " he said , " when you tell us that you have the boy 's best interests at heart . But we think we are entitled to know what you 're talking about . I am certain it has to do with the minister who married them . " Nell nodded her head , unhappy at this need to raise doubts . " His mother told me , after I had questioned her closely , that she did n't get a marriage certificate from the minister . She did n't seem to attach any importance to it . But I could n't help wondering if  --  if he had the right to give one . You see , he belonged to some religious sect . Emmy  --  the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world was coming to an end soon and that when it did they would be the only ones allowed to rise from the grave . I 'm sure from what she told me that the man considered himself a minister in the sight of God and therefore free to perform marriages . The sect seems to have ignored the law in everything . " She looked first at Carboy and then at the lawyer , sensing the feelings she had aroused in both . " You need n't be afraid ! I wo n't do anything to let it be known . The boy must n't be hurt . I feel as badly about it as you do . But you 'll have to be careful what action you take while this doubt remains . " Carboy laid a hand on Jonathan 's shoulder and led him to a corner of the room . " She 's right , " he whispered . " I wondered why there was n't a certificate . What 's your opinion ? " " In the first place , Samuel , I think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . Her sole concern is for the boy . But it will be better not to go into court until we 've explored the matter further . For one thing you ca n't demand custody of the boy if the marriage was not a legal one . Certainly you could n't get him until he 's fourteen . " " But , damme , look at her ! " exclaimed Carboy . " She 's downright handsomeand she 'll be getting married one of these days . It stands to reason that anyone as attractive as that wo n't remain single all her life . Suppose she marries some fellow who does n't share her scruples ? Suppose she tells him all about it ? That would put us in a pretty fix . The whole story would come out . Should n't we press for a settlement before anything of the kind can happen ? " " Samuel , " said the lawyer earnestly , " we ca n't go into court . This affidavit she was smart enough to get has settled that . We have no case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , " there 's only one thing to be done . You must go to America and look into it yourself . I ca n't wait for this fellow Spurlock to hoist his backsides out of his chair and get to work . I want action . Find the mother and pay her whatever she asks . Ah  --  within reason , that is . Find the minister , if you have to travel to the pole , and get that point cleared up . " Jonathan Bade nodded in assent . " It 's the only way , I 'm afraid . I 'll drop everything and go . " Carboy looked cautiously in the direction of Nell . " And in the meantime what happens here ? What do we do about her and the boy ? " " Nothing . We must wait until I 've had a chance to clear things up . " Nell had been watching them with the merest hint of a smile on her lips . " Now that you 've decided not to drag things into court  --  as I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grandson , Mr. Carboy ? " The financier nodded in assent . He tried to be casual about it but it was evident that he was eager to see the boy . " I caught a glimpse of him a week or so ago . The little rascal was riding a pony ; and doing an oncommon good job of it , back straight , head up , just like his father . It made me feel badly , even though I was n't sure at the time he was my grandson . It made me realize that I  --  well , that I had been hard on the boy  --  on Allie , I mean . " Nell looked at him with quickened interest . " If you feel that way , Mr. Carboy , it will be much easier for me to give little Sammy to you when the time comes that I must . " She walked to a side door and called : " Sam ! Where are you ? There 's someone here to see you . " It was Daniel Groody who came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shuffled his feet uneasily as he looked at Samuel Carboy . " I 'm glad to see you , Groody , " said the latter . " We parted in anger but that 's all forgotten and in the past now . "  | " That fella ye 've got in my place , " said Groody . " I 'd enjiy a word or two with that fellow . He 's hard on the horses . " " Father , where is Sammy ? His grandfather wants to see him . " " He 's gone away . " " Papa Groody ! He has not gone away . What foolishness is this ? " " He 's gone on a churney . To Rooshia . " " I know you , Daniel Groody ! " exclaimed his daughter . " You 've hidden him somewhere . " " He 's gone on a churney , I 'm telling you . " " He 's gone no further on this journey than the haymow . And it 's not necessary . Mr. Carboy is n't thinking of taking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irishman 's face . " Indeed , and in that case , it 's not to Rooshia the boy 's gone . It 's to the haymow , just like you suspectioned , childie . I 'll tell the boy it 's safe to come down . " " Are you teaching my grandson to regard me as an ogre ? " demanded Carboy when Groody had left . " Have you made him afraid of me ? " " No , Mr. Carboy . I 've tried instead to make him properly proud of what you are and what you 've done . If there 's any feeling it 's with the boy himselfand my father . Sammy is happy here , Mr. Carboy . Ile does n't want to be taken away . " When the boy came in , followed by Daniel Groody , who seemed determined to make sure that nothing happened , Carboy walked over to Nell . " What a difference this year has made ! " he said in a low tone . " He 's my boy all over again . There can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I meant what I said just now about my treatment of Allie . I was unfair to him . I was sharp and harsh ; and I suppose you can say that I was responsible for the way he died . Well , I 'm going to do right by his son . That much you can be sure of . I 'm going to make up to him for all the things I did n't do for Allie . " " Sammy , " said Nell , her voice showing a tendency to choke up , " you know this is your grandfather , do n't you ? Are you going to speak to him ? " " How do you do , sir . " " I 'm quite well , my boy . " Carboy paused , not knowing what to say . He finally adopted the obvious course . " Would you like to have some money if I should be lucky enough to find some right here in my pocket ? " " Oh yes , sir . " " Supposing now that I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ? " " I think , sir , I would spend some of it on new gear for Turk . He 's kind of shabby , sir . And the rest I would put away . "  | " Now then , let 's get this straight . How much of it would you spend on gear and how much would you put away ? " " I think , sir , " said the boy after some thought , " that one pound would be enough for the gear . I would put all the rest away . " " And how much would that be ? " " Oh , Mr. Carboy , " said Nell , " that is n't fair . He has n't got to division yet . " " I think , sir , it would be four pounds left . " " There , you see ! " cried Carboy triumphantly . " He knows . This grandson of mine can figure by instinct . And he intends to spend one pound only and put four pounds away . I can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get along fine ! "  |p377TEN  YEARS have passed . In those ten years many things happened in England . George IV died , mourned by very few , and a brother took his place on the throne as William IV , to reign a few years only and then pass on to the valhalla reserved for sea kings . The responsibility was then assumed by a girl of eighteen named Victoria , a rather plump and rather pretty young lady ; and the people of the country began to hope at once that the era of regal disreputability had come to an end with the passing of the last of the sons of poor old George III . There had been political upheavals . An overwhelming demand for reformhad resulted in sweeping electoral changes . This was a good thing for the country but a very bad thing for George Ninian Grace , because rotten boroughs had been done away with and , of course , Little Grimditch had been high on the list . Regretting that he no longer had a seat in the House , Grace took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains to bring in the name of Samuel Carboy at every opportunity , in far from complimentary terms . The country was in a state of change apart from politics . Railways were being built ( with Carboy taking no more than a wary financial interest in them ) and the lighting of city streets by gas had ceased to be a novelty . Buildings were being torn down to make room for Trafalgar Square and all London was very much concerned about a shortage in cemeteries . A law had been passed that no apprentices under sixteen years of age could be employedas chimney sweeps , the whole nation having become aroused to the iniquity of that method of keeping home fires burning ; but as chimneyswere seldom large enough to admit boys of sixteen , and they had to be cleaned , there was a great deal of winking at this particular law . Old Sheppy had died , for the time comes when even dukes must leave their grandeur behind them . Young Chip , therefore , had moved a step nearer the stage when he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had married but did not seem to be taking matrimony seriously . Mrs. Carboy had died , lacking both strength and will to continue living after the loss of her beloved son . Mrs. Groody also had passed away , notp378because of her rheumatism nor for any reason the doctor could put a tongue to , unless it was her heart ; a very quiet death in a rocking chair . Out on the western rim of the world , on the island of Jamaica to be exact , still another lady , Mrs. Timothy Ballard , had flitted to a higher sphere , to join her muchlovedConstance and the six infant Ballards in their identical white bonnets and strings of blue ribbon . To the list of those who had joined the majority must be added the names of the brothers Beck . Samuel Carboy had attended the funeral of Heaven Beck , who had been the last to go , and had caused amazement by offering a pound to anyone who would give a home to one of what might be termed the bereaved pets . His foresight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stipulation that one half would be paid at once and the balance at the end of a year ; a precaution which insured them a home . When asked his reason for this unusual exhibition of generosity , Carboy had been at a loss to explain himself . Did he love pets ? he was asked . No , on the contrary , he was disposed to dislike them , particularly dogs . Had he been in the debt of the brothers Beck ? No , they had been in his debt . Finally he had satisfied himself on the score of his reason , although he did not put it into words . Beck had been associated in his mind with the greatest moment of his life and this had been a bond between them . Samuel Carboy now owned so many factories that it was difficult to find sufficient labor , although almshouses and parish schools were looked over to find children old enough ( eight years was satisfactory ) to begin **26;8903;TOOLONG . He controlled as many ships as the Admiralty , and he had plantations in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheds in the south seas . He was powerful and rich but sometimes he found it hard to shake out the barbs planted in his hide by his old partner . Twice the question of a knighthood had been discussed by the Cabinet but each time the opposition had been too great . Mrs. Carboy had died before Jonathan Bade returned from his investigationsin the United States and so she never knew that Emmy Sweet had agreed to have her son transferred to the care of his paternal grandfather . Emmy had become thoroughly tired of the portrayer of villain roles , and faced the necessity of involving herself in heavy expense for a divorce . She was not as slender as she had been and the symmetry of her legs was commented on less frequently . But she was still romantically inclined and she had her eye on the new juvenile who appeared on the bills as Chauncv Dawlish but whose real name was George Mash . Accordingly she accepted the money that the English lawyer dangled before her eyes , and betook herself and her legs and her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan had discovered , moreover , that there was some shadowy possi bility that the minister who had married Alfred Carboy and Emmy Sweetp379had been within his rights . It was agreed among all the parties concerned that this flimsy bit of justification should be accepted and never again referred to for the same reason that sleeping dogs are allowed to lie . Nell Groody relinquished her beloved Sammy to his grandfather . The boy agreed to go when she said that he could take Turk with him . The pony lived out his last years in ease and plenty at Beaulaw Hall , for young Sam soon took to riding horses . He would canter down the main street of Little Shallow , with a groom at his side , and stop at the Old Rectory for a visit with the diminished Groody family . One very sad day he rode by to tell his aunt Helen , as he continued to call her , that he was leaving the next day for Eton . But while life had been churning and changing in England , the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , except for what has been related , somewhat uneventful . This is not surprising . After all the excitement he had shared with his three musketeer companions , D'Artagnan stood for twenty years , in the anteroom of the French king and nothing happened to him . Life has a way of packing much into short spaces of time and then pausing to rest and catch its breath . The ten years had been so humdrum , in fact , that at this point , when it becomes the duty of the narrator to pick up the threads again , it is necessary to begin by telling of two games of whist . Many readers will accept this as proof that life was indeed dull and monotonous . Two hansom cabs stopped in front of Brooks 's Club in St. James 's Street at exactly the same moment . It was well past the dinner hour and there was not a star in the sky . The first of the two passengers to alight peered dubiously into the gloom and finally said : " Ah , it 's you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We are punctual men , Father-in-law , " answered Gardiner . Closer inspectionthan the darkness made possible would have shown that he was thin and that his face had new lines and creases . " Have to be , " declared Samuel Carboy . " Seconds are precious gold to me and I assume that other men 's time is equally valuable . ' Tai n't , of course . " He looked sharply at the baronet . " You 're a bit run down , ai n't you ? Are your years catching up with you ? " The unwillingness of all men of advancing years , who have young and beautiful wives , to acknowledge the inroads of time brought the baronetp380quickly to his own defense . " Not at all ! " he said . " I 'm in excellent trim . I 've been three times this season at the Green Man with the golfers . Did n't you know that my wonderful Isabelle and I were partners the last time and came in far ahead of the field ? I feel younger every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into the club . He asked : " Will there be any ceremony to go through ? I mean , will I have to face a committee or something of that kind ? " Gardiner shook his head . " You 'll have to stop and pay down your membershipguineas . That 's all . We made a rather neat thing of getting you through . A single blackball does the trick , you know , and there were three members of the committee who swore to block you ; all of them living off their own land and so not open to pressure . " " I 'm not so sure of that , " said Carboy grimly . " There 's always a bank you can use to get at them . " " Well , there they were , these stubborn three , and all of them itching to drop the blackball . We saw to it that each of them received a late invitation to a rather special tea this afternoon . They went . I suppose each of them thought the other two would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to have seen their faces when they met at the tea and realized they 'd been done . " Carboy was not pleased that there had been so much difficulty in getting him elected . He frowned heavily as he followed his companion up the steps of the famous club . " Someday , " he was thinking , " those three stiffneckedTories will feel the weight of my dislike . I 'll not rest until I 've paid them back a hundred times over . " Carboy had heard of the splendors of the great salon in the club but he could not suppress a grunt of surprise when he stood under its immense arched ceiling and saw that on the floor stood , seemingly , all the great men of England . Having been sternly tutored by his son-in-law , Carboy had reluctantly encased his gristly legs in black breeches and the sleekest of silk stockings . He was glad that he had yielded , for there was n't a pair of trousers in the place . " They would n't admit the Duke of Wellington one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the mistake of not wearing breeches . " Two men , who were progressing arm in arm through the crowd , came to a sudden stop when they saw the great industrialist . One of them looked down his nose at Carboy and scowled in a most superior way . " What are you doing here , sir ? " he demanded to know . " I am a member of the club , sir , " answered Carboy . " If you are , sir , there has been some highly reprehensible juggling of thep381rules . If men in trade are to be members , then I for one shall be quick to tender my resignation , sir . " " I had no idea , sir , that my election would prove so beneficial to the club . " The objector , who was a certain Lord Creatley , had a round head covered with stiff black hair like a scrub brush . He spoke to his companion . " Mark my words , Gussie , my boy , " he said . " We 'll have haberdashers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snide drapers . I swear , Gussie , we 'll soon be making bets against our own valets if this sort of thing keeps up . " His companion laughed . " Gad , Artie , you 're in rare form tonight . You are indeed , old boy . That about betting against our valets , now , that was capital . I 'm going to repeat it , if you do n't mind . " " Son-in-law , " said Carboy , leading Gardiner to one side , " am I to assume that I 'll always have to take this kind of treatment ? Is there something shameful about being in trade ? The prosperity of England is based on her foreign trade . For generations the family of Carboy has been in the eastern trade . It 's an honorable business . My family has been an honorable one . I 'm an honorable man . I do n't deserve this kind of thing . " " Do n't give the matter a thought , " protested Gardiner . " Creatley is a mean little fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's time , " declared Carboy , " that this kind of snobbishness was stamped out . I 'll have a chance someday perhaps to do the stamping myself . What should I do in the meantime ? Should I get hold of this fellow and throw him bodily out of the place ? " " No , no ! " cried Gardiner . " That would be a very great mistake . No violence , if you please . My advice to you , Father-in-law , is to forget the whole matter . " Carboy 's debut became much more pleasant after this opening episode but he noticed a certain reserve nevertheless about all of the members he met . He knew most of them and had often had dealings with them ; but here they were on their own ground and not on his , and they showed it in many ways . Even those who were almost obsequious in business were a little standoffish here . The difference was hard to define but it was noticeablein the tone of their voices , in the ease they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was sensible enough to make no effort to break down the barrier ; but he filed a few mental notes away for future use . " I wo n't forget , " he repeated to himself several times . Only when he encountered a member of Parliament , one Richardp382Brinsley Wolfenden who was reputed to be close to cabinet stature , did he find everything normal again . The parliamentarian wanted his opinion and so discarded any sense of social superiority he might otherwise have felt . Buttonholing the financial giant ( who loomed so large in the world of trade even if he dragged his feet slightly in the halls of privilege ) , the member drew Carboy to one side of the room . " My dear Mr. Carboy , " he said . " I am sure you follow the course of international affairs as closely as if you sat in the House yourself . What do you think of the Frenchman ? " " I think ill of all Frenchmen , " answered Carboy . " Which one do you refer to in particular ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you know he has come to this country ? " " I heard something about it . He 's in London , I hear . And being taken up socially . " " Exactly . And now , sir , will you condescend to give me your opinion of the man ? " Carboy indulged in a snort . " He has the ambition of the great Napoleon but lacks his genius . And yet this obstinate young man makes a wonderful tool for us . He 's a born troublemaker and he 'll go on stirring up dissension until he gets the throne of France . Then , sir , he 'll be most uncommonly useful to us . He 'll ruin France and in doing so he 'll cause a great deal of trouble for all Europe , particularly Germany . I despise the little creature , of course , waddling about in shoes too big for him and his head swallowed up in a three-cornered hat . But we ought to pay him a fat pension not to give up his ambitious ideas . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 's going to start the NapoleonicWars again ? " " Mr. Wolfenden , " said Carboy , " do you realize that England , which was a maritime and agricultural nation , is now becoming an industrial nation as well ? Have you seen the smokestacks rising in the Midlands ? Do you know how much we 're exporting to all parts of the world ? The French and the Germans are better fitted for this sort of thing than we are but we 're starting to leave them far behind . I do n't believe they know yet what is happening to them . " " I see your point , Mr. Carboy . " " That is where this dull little drum-thumper comes in . He 's going to steal the throne of France and keep the Continent in a turmoil while we coolly pocket the trade of the world . " The member had been listening to every word with the greatest concentration . " The government must decide whether he 's to be allowed toTp383live in England . Ever since the Strasbourg incident  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the French government has made it clear they would rather we would n't harbor him . They have n't taken a stand yet but it may come to that . Now , what are we to do about it ? Your opinion , I judge , is that we should allow him to stay . " " Not only that , sir , " declared Carboy , " but we should butter him up with praise and stuff him full of belief in his own greatness . They tell me he 's susceptible and so the best way is to see that he meets all our most charming ladies  --  and instruct them to make him believe he 's greater than his uncle . " The member said to himself , " There 's no one in England better suited for that than your own daughter , Mr. Samuel Carboy . " At this point Sir Theobald Gardiner joined them to ask whether the new member desired to try his luck at the faro table . This game of chance was still the most popular one at Brooks 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's knights , was devoted to it , whereas all other games had small tables along the walls or in corners . Carboy shook his head . " I do n't care for gambling . But I would enjoy a game of whist , if it could be arranged . " Gardiner looked along the nearest wall and his eye lighted on a table where three men were sitting , engaging in what , most clearly , was a desultoryattempt at conversation . " I think perhaps they 're waiting for a fourth player over there . But I strongly advise against cutting in . " The member looked in the same direction and indulged in a low whistle . " Decidedly not . Those three are the best players in the club . They play for very high stakes . " Carboy did not know any of the trio but he seemed quite unimpressed by the reputations they enjoyed . " I 'm willing , if they 're in need of another , and will take me . " " Samuel ! " exclaimed Gardiner . " Those birds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you alive . It will be like throwing a child into a pool of crocodiles . I assure you , they 'll take more out of your pockets than you 'll enjoy losing . " " I play whist , " said the member . " Perhaps I could find two others and give you a game . " Carboy thanked him but insisted that they must not go to so much trouble . " Just lead me over and introduce me to those three vultures , " he said . " I 'll take my chance with them , if you do n't mind . " Two hours later the baronet returned to the table where his father-in-law had been doing battle with the three most expert whist players , and the toughest , in all London . The game was breaking up and to his amazement he saw that the trio were passing large mounds of bank notes across thep384table to Samuel Carboy . He heard the latter say , " Thank you , gentlemen , " as he pocketed the notes . " It was a most pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one of the three . " Not for us . Are you Midas come back to earth , with his touch unimpaired ? " Gardiner looked at Carboy in astonishment as they made their way to the cloakroom . " Did you actually win all that money from them ? " he asked . " Son-in-law , " said the financier easily , " I take it you will agree that Isabelleis a very fine whist player ? " " A wonderful player . But then she 's wonderful at everything . " Carboy grinned . " Will it surprise you if I say that I taught her the game ? " Sir Theobald Gardiner sat at his desk frowning over a pile of mail . It was still very early  --  ten-forty , to be exact  --  and he was wearing a handsome dressing gown of scarlet , befrogged and becuffed in silver . Isabelle came to the door , crop in hand , riding hat on head . She seemed in a decidedly impatient mood . " Mudge said you asked for me . " The baronet laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , as though striving to analyze her mood before proceeding with what he had to say . " Yes , dear child . I knew that if you once got away I might not see you until dinnertime . Who is to be your riding partner ? " " Gertrude Umpstead . With grooms , of course . " He seemed relieved . " I do n't like the woman . She 's a flirt , a liar and an arrant gossip . But it 's better to be with her than the men you generally honor with your company in the park . " " You do n't care to ride yourself , you know , " she reminded him . " I believe it 's a relief to you that I do n't . You seem to prefer the company of other men . " Isabelle 's eyes hardened . " What has brought on the sulks this time , my very dear husband ? " she asked . He did not retreat at once as was his usual habit . Instead he leaned back in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbearing , " he said . " Your flirtations are the talk of London but so far I have  --  I have done nothing . It may be that I 've kept my eyes closed to unpleasant truths . I do n't want to believe anything bad about you , my very dear wife . " He sighed deeply . " But I wish you to understand that from now on I am going to protect my good name . I do n't intend to have all London laughing at me. "  |p385Isabelle  began to tap the side of one boot with her riding crop . Her eyes had turned a red-brown . " And what do you propose to do ? " " I shall insist in future on knowing your plans for each day . I am going to refuse to let you see certain people . To begin with , I shall give you a list of those you must not see again . " " How interesting ! How very interesting ! What makes you think I 'll consent to have my husband become my jailer ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabelle , it 's the only way ! " he exclaimed . " You must see that we 're riding head on for trouble . I ca n't keep my eyes closed any longer . You must come to your senses , my dear , before it 's too late . Do you want to be barred from court ? Do you want people calling you an immoral woman ? " Isabelle seated herself so that she faced him . " There 's something I must tell you , " she said . " You do n't seem to know how hard it is to be the young wife of an old man . We have n't a single taste in common . I love to dance . You do n't . I like to stay out late . You want to go to bed early . You do n't ride , you do n't play cards , you do n't do any of the things I like . " He nodded sadly . " I realize it fully , dear Isabelle . That is why I have been so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened letter and seemed on the point of quoting from it . Changing his mind , he dropped it back on top of the pile . " I want to help you , my dear . The situation we 've drifted into may harm you more than me . " He sighed again . " I introduced you to Prince Louis Napoleon because your father thought he should be taken up  --  for reasons that you understand as well as I do . But I did not mean you to become one of the prince 's confidantes . You see him much too often . " Isabelle said to herself , " It 's a good thing he does n't know how often I 've seen my little Boney . " " Unfortunately , " he went on , " we must attend his reception this evening . It 's even more unfortunate that I have another engagement which ca n't be broken . I shall escort you there , pay my respects to the prince , and leave . I 'll return to take you home early . At eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best behavior while I 'm gone . " After a moment he added in a voice of considered decision : " I have no intention of letting you get involved any further with that lot . The prince is as promiscuous in his habits as his famous uncle . The men around him are cheap and dangerous opportunists . " Isabelle got to her feet . " There 's no time now to discuss this further , dear lord and master , but I shall have a great deal to say to you later . As for this evening , it shall be as you say . I 'll be ready to return with you at eleven o'clock like any plump little country wife . I wo n't be happy about it . And you wo n't be happy over what I shall say to you later . "  |p386He  picked up a slip of paper from the desk . " Here is the list I mentioned . " Isabelle did not turn her head as she left the room . " I am not interested in your list , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footmen up behind and an eagle painted on the side panels in a bright blue , turned out of St. James 's Park . In it rode a stoutish man , with a good brow and a goatee , and a lady of quite remarkable beauty . " My little Isabelle , " said the man , accenting the words accurately , although it was quite clear that he was not English , " it was a most pleasant coincidence that we met in the park . And it was very kind of you to be persuaded to have the groom take your horse on , so I would have the privilege of driving you home . " " Yes , a pleasant coincidence indeed , " answered Lady Gardiner in a low tone , " if we overlook the note I had from your most exalted Excellency , and the note I sent to Gertrude Umpstead to say that I could not ride with her . " She indulged in a light laugh . " And if I am not very much mistaken , my great and supreme Emperor-to-be  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word I 'm saying  --  I am not to be taken home . You will get out at Carlton Gardens and have them drive me on from there . " " That is indeed my intention , my little Isabelle . " He was verging on the middle years and , inasmuch as he had taken into his own hands the baton of leadership of the Bonaparte family , he was often compared to his illustrious uncle , Napoleon . Actually the resemblance was not very marked ; he lacked the look of concentrated power , the light in the eye . It might more accurately have been said that he looked , as far as his features were concerned , like a certain brilliant young man in the Conservativeparty whose name was D'Israeli or , even more , a still younger man whose name was Dickens and who was bringing out in monthly installmentsa novel called Nicholas Nickleby . " Was it only the pleasure of my company you sought in sending me the note , my most charming and exalted and all-powerful et cetera ? " Isabelle was speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shared . His eyes twinkled in response . A satisfactory basis of relationship had been established between them since the pretender to the French throne had come to England to live and had acquired the handsome house in Carlton Gardens which belonged to Lord Ripon . " Or , " she continued , " did you have something to tell me ? Have you , by any chance , reached a decision ? " " A decision , sweet Isabelle ? My child , I make scores of decisions every day . "  | " Do n't bandy words with me , 0 King who will , I trust , live forever . There is only one , as you well know . " Prince Louis Napoleon stroked his glossy goatee . " The decision ? Perhaps 1 have made it . But it will not happen for  --  for a very long time . " Isabelle was disappointed . " I 've heard you say the time is ripe . Why then delay ? " She drew her handsome brows together in a frown . " I can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You need n't look at me with that stern Napoleonic eye , 0 Prince . I have made up my mind . I want excitementand I want to play a part in historic events before I settle down into middle age  --  when it will be too late . " " Should I feel flattered that you are ready to stake so much in my behalf ? Your life even ? " " Every other man I know would be bitterly opposed to having me take such a risk . " " A wife could accompany me , of course , " said the prince . " A mistress , perhaps . But a spectator , no matter how beautiful ? No , my clear Isabelle . " " I would n't be a spectator . I would wear , perhaps , an officer 's uniform like that lovely little creature who was with Napoleon in Egypt . " " I think you mean La Bellilotte . " " Yes , that was the one . The emperor had such a power to compel the devotion of lovely women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Napoleon preened himself . " In some degree , I think . But , dear Lady Gardiner , I must draw the line at certain manifestations of this devotion . There will be no wearing of uniforms like La Bellilotte when I put out to sea . " " I must have a uniform of some kind . Ah , I have it ! A vivandiere . " " No , not a vivandiere . It will be rough work , and no place for a lady . " The smile vanished from his face . " I may change my mind about making the attempt . An invasion is a great risk under the most favorable circumstances . Can we be sure the army is anxious for a change ? Are the people of France tired of the stupid usurper who now occupies the throne ? All this must be considered , for the fortunes of the Bonapartes will be risked on a single cast of the dice . " He went on after a moment 's thought : " I know , dear Isabelle , that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pretty ears with so much dull political talk . " Isabelle answered with an eager rush of words . " Excellency ! My devotion knows no limits . I could not be guilty of the crime of repeating a word spoken in my hearing ! " The smile with which he received this declaration of allegiance had a slight touch of self-consciousness about it . " I am well aware , dear Isabelle , how completely you are to be trusted . There is no one I rely on more . " Hep388reached over discreetly and gave her hand an approving pat . " How lovely you are this morning ! You seem to grow in beauty every moment . You will be with us this evening ? " " Yes , Excellency . " " And your husband also , I trust ? " The carriage had turned into Carlton Gardens and the horses came to a stop . The footmen sprang down to assist the alighting of the French prince . " My husband , " said Isabelle , " will fetch me here at nine and call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her before lowering his head to kiss her hand . " An excellent arrangement , dear Isabelle . I shall make the most of those two precious hours . " But the head of the Bonaparte family was to see little of Isabelle that evening . When she arrived , escorted by her husband , he was standing in a brilliant group , made up for the most part of the loveliest women in London . " I am happy to see you , Lady Gardiner , " he said , kissing her hand . " And Sir Theobald also . Though I am told , sir , that you do not intend to stay . That you are generous enough to permit us the honor of your wife 's company is the very finest compensation for your own absence . " " Your Highness does not seem to need much in the way of compensation , " said Isabelle , looking rather critically at the group about him . Her husband had already bowed and departed . In a low voice she added : " You look positively radiant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are happy to have so much beauty about you . But where is the prettiest of them all , the one who is never spoken of by any other name than Miss Howard ? She is high in your favor , I am told . " " She is not here , " answered Louis Napoleon in a tone which hinted that he was a little vexed . " She is never asked for large receptions , as you know very well . Because of this , I do not hesitate to ask a favor of you . That you will play in a game of whist this evening . Am I asking too much ? " Isabelle 's first reaction was one of annoyance . She had dressed with particularcare , selecting one of her favorite gowns . It was of black velvet and displayed her shoulders to the fullest advantage . In several respects it was a departure from the mode of the moment , and so courage as well as pulchritudewas required to make an appearance in it . The sleeves were not so extended that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inp389graceful folds close to the wrists . On the other hand the skirt was longer and so much more wide and voluminous that she had found it necessary to practice walking with the shortest steps to avoid setting it to swaying like the inrolling waves of the sea . This was not a costume to be tucked under a whist table , to go unnoticed for the whole evening . " I see that it does not much appeal to you , my little Isabelle . " She responded by asking who would make up the table . " Lord Henricot and Colonel Teeple . To make the fourth , I have already bespoken Claude de Launy , who is , I think , known to you . " Three men ! That , she conceded mentally at once , would be some compensation . She had a slight acquaintance with the first two named and was sure they would be prepared to play for a substantial stake . Her interest was now aroused , for she loved the excitement of high play and performed at her best under such circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was often at the receptions of the prince and was reputed to be an excellent cardplayer . He had the wide white brow of a poet and the physique of an athlete . Isabelle knew him very slightly and had always felt she would enjoy a closer acquaintance . " You said , 0 great Prince , that we would make the most of our two hours , " said Isabelle . She gave him , nevertheless , one of her most brilliant smiles . " Ah , well , I understand . You must be gracious to so many . Because I feel a little sorry for you , I shall let myself be banished into exile . Send me to your island of detention , your salt mine , your whist table . I shall strive to make the best of it . " The prince smiled . " My sweet Isabelle ! It would he easy for me to fall in love with you . " " It is very easy , " she declared , " for Your Highness to fall in love . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table with her lighted up when she joined them . Lord Henricot said , " What luck , I say , what great luck ! " Colonel Teeple bowed from his great height and remarked , " It is a privilege indeed but will we be able to keep our minds on the game ? " Claude de Launy kissed her hand and murmured fervently , " At last ! At last ! " Isabelle said to herself as she gave the young Frenchman an intent look , " He 's the handsomest creature I 've ever set eyes on . " He was more than that , it developed as the game went on . He was gay and had the pleasantest manners and his smile was nothing short of devastating . At first she wondered if it would be possible for her to play her best game but after the first hand the habit of concentration resumed its hold . She played as well as ever , which was very well indeed . It was enough to make Lord Henricot drop his gallant way of addressing her , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self and partner compels me to take this trick " and to become even a little abrupt . Colonel Teeple gnawed the ends of his sandy mustache and glared down at the table where the cards were making him the sufferer of many mischances , The young Frenchman played brilliantly but in bad luck . At the end of two hours , the time she had stipulated for the game to end , the three men drew out their reluctant wallets and built up high piles of bank notes which they then pushed across the table toward her . Lord Henricotwas not happy about it and , from the look in the hot brown eyes of Colonel Teeple , it was a good thing he was not presiding at a court-martial . The two older men then rose , bowed and took their departure , leaving the impression that as far as they were concerned chivalry had its limits and that being beaten at cards by a beautiful woman was not an experienceto call out their most gracious sides . Isabelle leaned her black velvet sleeves on the table and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed distrait and unhappy . " Monsieur Claude de Launy , " she said , " I am of the impression that you lost more this evening than you can afford . " The young man flushed . He did not answer at once and it was apparent that he did not know what to say . " It is true , Lady Gardiner , " he answered finally . He gestured at the pile of notes and gold coins he had passed across the table to her . " My pockets now are empty . " " But you play a great deal , m'sieur . " " Yes , Lady Gardiner . I am , as you will perhaps be lenient enough to concede , a good player . Of course , I am no match for you but I am good enough to win in almost any company . I might as well confess to you that I make my living by playing whist . " " I 'm beginning to realize , " said Isabelle , keeping her eyes fixed on his , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw you . I 'm sorry to know that you 're in financial straits --  " " I 've been this way before , madame . It 's not a new experience . When you live by your wits you become accustomed to both ups and downs . " " But it was my impression that you belonged to the French nobility and could afford to follow Prince Louis Napoleon into exile as a matter of duty . " " I am of a good family , " answered Claude de Launy . " But my father was an ardent Bonapartist and at the restoration all his property was confiscated . You could n't believe the hardships my brothers and I suffered in the process of living and growing up . We all had to make our own way in the world . I chose the easiest  --  but the most uncertain . " p 391 " I 'm discovering that I 'm quite fond of you . " They sat in silence then for several minutes , looking into each others ' eyes . " I ca n't believe it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Gardiner . I have worshiped you so long from a distance . Such a distance ! " Isabelle 's fingers were busily collecting the notes and the gold and silver pieces into one pile . She then made a quick gesture and shoved the money to his side . " You must not be angry with me . As I said before , I like you ; and that gives me privileges . I can help you . You must accept this money  --  your own , and the losses of our late and rather unpleasant opponents . " " Lady Gardiner ! " cried the young Frenchman . " Your eyes tell me that you like me , " said Isabelle . " I have already confessedthat I like you . Surely , then , there 's no reason for me to stand aside and see you suffer inconvenience . " She paused . " It 's truly remarkable bow the Ripon House has been transformed . It has always been gracious but now our good prince has turned it into a bit of France  --  Napoleonic France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . They are mementosof Napoleon , I think . " " Yes , my lady . I shall be proud to act as your guide . And happy , also , and excited . Ah , my lady , how very excited ! " Isabelle had risen to her feet . " It will even be a way of avoiding all these people until my husband arrives . " " A bitter reminder that you have a husband . For the moment I had forgotten him . " So Claude de Launy , his dark eyes glowing and his manner proof that he was emotionally unhinged , guided her about the great drawing room . " The emperor , my lady , " he said , stopping in front of a portrait . " But not , I think , one of the happiest . It is a little dull , do n't you think ? " His voice fell to a whisper . " My lady is not very much interested . " " No , m'sieur , not very . But let us go on . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a portrait of the empress . " " Josephine ? " " Yes , my lady . The lovely Creole . She was lovely . At least she seems so when I look at the painting and not  --  not at you , dear lady . " " You are very sweet . " " This , " rather hurriedly , " is the prince 's mother , Queen Hortense of Holland , the daughter of Josephine . They say she was most charming . Tied , unhappily , to the stupidest of the Bonaparte brothers . " " She looks rather tragic . " . " So much for the portraits . Here in this nest of fortunate velvet is a very great reminder of the glorious days . It is Napoleon 's coronation ring . "  |p392On  the wall beside one of the huge fireplaces was a long scarf of cashmere . The young Frenchman paused in front of it . " The emperor wore this at the Battle of the Pyramids , " he said in a tone of awe . Isabelle did not look . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband has just come in . I shall have to go . But , m'sieur , we must see each other again . " " Yes , oh yes ! " declared Claude de Launy . " If my lady will tell me how  --  and when and where --  " " You ca n't come to me . " Isabelle was whispering . Her cheeks had flushed . " My husband is jealous , being so much older than I am . Our London house is  --  well , Tibby says it 's like a coaching office . People coming and going all the time . My dear M'sieur Claude , I shall have to go to you . " " My lady ! " The Frenchman 's eyes had become more luminous than the three-candle sconce under which they stood . " Will you deign to come ? Ah , gracious and lovely lady , my rooms are neat but they are small and in a very poor neighborhood . I am not sure I can allow you to come . " " All the better , " declared Isabelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being seen and recognized . You must be prepared to greet someoneplainly dressed . " The new duke occupied Outland Park with his waspish wife and so it had been necessary for Young Chip to find other quarters for himself and his rather plain spouse . Scorning the Dower House , which was in an advancedstate of disrepair and suffering from chronic drain trouble , he had persuaded his wealthy father-in-law to buy them a house on the floor of the Vale within sight of the White Horse . There is no land more fertile and green and pleasant than is to be found in the Vale ; but their new habitation , which was called Strothe House , seemed singularly out of harmony with the gentle meadows from which it rose . It was a tall and quite ugly pile of gray stone , set in a clump of high trees over which a single window in the one gable seemed to squint at passers-by like an inquisitive woman . At the back there was good stabling ,  |p393which  unquestionably had been a factor in its selection . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which trout could sometimes be taken . It was to this rather ungainly residence that Sir Theobald Gardiner drove one night some four months later , accompanied by a close friend , Colonel Frisbie of the East Anglian Fusiliers . It was now late in the fall and a heavy rain was falling . The lash of the storm against the sides of the carriage caused the baronet to sigh heavily . As they came in sight of the house he said to his companion , " If this is to be my last night , it might have been arranged for the stars to be out . I would like another look at the moon . " " Come , Tib , " said the soldier , " why be so down in the mouth ? The Frenchy is probably an abominably bad shot . By the way , you have n't told me anything about yourself . Are you good with the shiny little fellows ? " " I 've fired a pistol only once in my life , " confessed Gardiner . " And that was by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damme , Tib , I do n't understand this at all . Why are you fighting with pistols if you know nothing about them ? " " What else was there to do ? I 'm the challenger . " " Of course . But there are ways , you know . We could have dodged the need to use pistols . " " It 's better as it is . " Gardiner drew another deep sigh . " My lack of skill with a sword would have made me ludicrous . " The colonel did not address his companion again as they crunched up the drive but grumbled bitterly to himself about wives who got into affairs with foreigners and made it necessary for their husbands to fight them . Young Chip was playing alone in the billiard room when they arrived , slamming the balls around and grumbling at his lack of an opponent , and even tossing the mace on the floor when he was through with it . He came out to greet them with a cue in his hand . " Hallo , what 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grayness and fatigue of the man who was married to the woman he himself coveted . " You look a bit slaggy , I must say . " " Can you put us up for the night ? " asked the baronet in a weary tone of voice . " We 'll be off at dawn . " " At dawn ? " Young Chip looked first at one and then at the other as understanding grew in him . " Look here , what are you two up to ? Is it a duel ? " Gardiner nodded . " Yes . I 'm meeting a Frenchman named Claude de Launy . The authorities got wind of it in London and I was informed we would be arrested on sight if we tried to break the law . Knowing we wouldp394be watched , it was decided we would have to get as far away as possible . In fact , that we would have to select one of the least likely places in all Eng-land . " " On the White Horse slope , " said Colonel Frisbie . Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had heard veiled rumors of Isabelle 's infatuation for some " damned French sponger " but he had refused to believe it . Now he realized it was true and he was as furious as Isabelle 's husband had been when convincing evidence had been brought him . The future Duke of Outland was so angry , in fact , that he wished he could change places with Gardiner and take on the punishmentof the Frenchman himself . " Tib , " he said , " you ca n't shoot straight . You could n't hit a haystack at ten paces . " " No , " agreed the baronet . " I 'm helpless with all weapons . " The future duke began to swear in loud and furious tones . " This mangy fellow , who deserves to be filled with good English lead , will get off scot free . Tib , there must be some other way of doing this . Do you suppose he would agree to let me take your place ? I could put a bullet right through the miserable cadger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , most decidedly not . Sir Theobald could not be guilty of such a confession of inability to face up to his own responsibilities . " Young Chip squared around to face the officer . " I suppose you 're acting as second ? " Frisbie nodded . " I 'm serving in that capacity . " The future duke struck the floor so savagely with his cue that it broke in two . " Our hands are tied ! " he exclaimed . " I can do nothing . I must stand by and see this beggarly cardsharp , this leech , get off without a scratch on his white skin ! Do this much , Tib : let me drive you over in the morning . If the chance arises  --  oh , it might , he could be guilty of some beastly breaking of the code  --  I 'll take a hand myself and horsewhip him within an inch of his life . " Sir Theobald had ensconced himself on a settle beside the fire . " It 's good of you , Chip , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid there 's only one thing you can do . You can get some supper for poor Frisbie , who has n't had a bite since noon . " Their host tugged at a bell cord . " There 's some cold roast beef and probablysomething in the way of a custard . My wife is sickly and has to be fed on that kind of pap . " He turned back to the principal in the case . " There must be something we can do , Tib . " " I 'm afraid not . I have some letters to write . If you could have me shownp395to a room , I would be glad to get at them . One of them is going to be difficult . I wo n't want any supper . " " Brandy ? " asked Young Chip . The baronet shook his head . " I may need a drop before we start in the morning . But not now . I 'm a duffer with weapons but there 's nothing very wrong with my courage . " When Young Chip came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carrying a candle in each hand , he found that his two guests were ahead of him . It was clear that Sir Theobald Gardiner had not been to bed , for his coat was rumpled ( perhaps for the first time in his life ) and his cravat was loose , and his eyes were sunk in hollows of sleeplessness . He was , however , in an easier mood and greeted his host with a warm smile . Colonel Frisbie had nothing to say and it was evident that he was in the grip of hunger . " They 'll be down immediately to attend to us , " said the future duke . He looked at the principal in the impending encounter . " How are you feeling ? " " Quite well , " answered the baronet . " I think I 'm reconciled to anything which may happen . And the letters are written , which is a load off my mind . I believe I 've attended to everything . " He produced a bundle of lettersaddressed in a handsome script and handed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one on the top is not to be entrusted to the mails and must be delivered personally , if you will be so good , Chip . You understand that they are to be delivered only if I  --  if I suffer certain consequences . " " You 've done nothing about seeing a lawyer , " declared Colonel Frisbie . Gardiner gave his head a shake . " I 'm not changing my will . The bitterness I felt at first has gone . I 'm not blaming Isabelle very much . I 'm an old man and not a satisfactory husband for one so young and beautiful . And there is this to be remembered : she gave her life into my keeping and she belonged to me through the last stages of girlhood and the first sweet years of her maturity . She was a lovely and captivating wife , even if she was capricious at times and with a will of her own . I was very happy and proud , and I still feel that I am in her debt . " He paused before adding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged her to cultivate the prince for political reasons . It was in part my fault . No , Frisbie , I have no thought of making changes in my will , of cutting her out of it . And I am glad that you and Chip are here to learn my reasons . "  |p396The  rain had stopped when they set out . It had fallen so heavily during the night that the woods were wet and the trees dripped as they passed . They crossed the Ock and found that usually placid little stream roaring under the narrow bridge in unexpected plenitude . The sky was still heavy and it seemed clear that there would be no sun to witness the scene in which they were to play parts . The future duke handled the reins with a skilled hand , giving vent to his feelings occasionally by cracking the whip in the air as though he were applying it to the shoulders of a certain Frenchman . Dr. Sweetland met them at Uffington with an instrument case in his hand . " Good morning , my lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The White Horse has seen many great and strange things but I wonder if it 's eye has rested before on anything quite like this . You , sir , I suspect , are Sir Theobald Gardiner . I 've seen you here and about . But you and I , " turning to Frisbie , are strangers , sir . " Gardiner introduced them . The doctor nodded . " You are acting as the second , then . This , I judge , is not as new for you as it is for Sir Theobald . " " No , " answered the officer shortly . It always took a long time after wakeningfor him to regain any degree of amiability . " I 've served in both capacities , as principal and second . Many times . It 's all very familiar . " They were climbing now and the pace of the horses had slackened . It was evident that every foot of the ground was familiar to the surgeon . When they took a sudden turn northward he sat up at once . " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That was the arrangement made , " answered Frisbie . " The Frenchman 's second has been over the ground and it was his suggestion . " " It will save us some leg work . At my age I am happy to go it easy . " The doctor swung around and spoke to Gardiner . " Your first venture , Sir Theobald ? I mean on the field of honor ? " The baronet nodded his head . " My first , sir . And I am persuaded to think it will be my last . " " Of course . You are a man of peace . This is a grim and terrible business and you will be glad to be over with it . " They were beginning now to encounter some signs of life . Birds were singing their matins in the dripping treetops and barnyard activities reached their ears faintly . From the direction of the hills they heard an early shepherdcalling " Teg , Teg , Teggy ! " They reached Woolston but did not take the narrow road which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its limbs on the crest of the hill . Instead they turned over to a still narrower road . A stout woman with her hair bound up in the kind of snood called a cockernony stared at them from behind a gate.  |p397She  had a milking pail in one red hand . " 00-ay ! " she said . " Sirs , it 's early it be to be going up there . " The doctor said in a low tone : " Too bad it had to be Mrs. Cramp . She 's the worst gossip in the whole Vale . " He looked ahead of them to where a high stand of trees cut off their view of the western half of the hill . " I take it we 're going to that bit of flat land this side of the Manger ? " Frisbie nodded . " The Frenchman 's second suggested it . He 's some kind of a scientist or other and is interested in the Horse . " Another carriage was laboring up the steep Woolston approach , the horses floundering in the mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners ! Why do we let them come in ? " They came to a level piece of land which had been under cultivation but had been so thoroughly harvested that a stubble goose would have starved on the remains . Frisbie looked the location over with a jaundiced eye . " I suppose it will have to do , " he said . " It is n't as smooth as a cricket crease exactly . But if the sun does come out  --  which seems pretty unlikely  --  there will be no advantage for either man . We 'll face them north and south . " Young Chip drove to the east end of the open space and the other carriage , as a matter of course , took the opposite end . He threw the reins to the groom who had accompanied them and sprang to the ground . Taking a few steps forward , he fixed his eyes intently on the party of three alighting from the second carriage . One of the new arrivals was a tall young man who had discarded his hat and who advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center . The future peer studied him with a hostile eye . " That 's the Frenchman ! " he said to himself . " I can tell it in every line of him . His heaviness of thigh , his damned poetic hair , his manner . I hate him on sight ! " Chip observed now that the seconds and the surgeon had moved together into the center ground and were discussing the rules . A countryman in a tattered smock had materialized from nowhere , seemingly , and was watching with a lethargic interest . Certain that his movements would not be noticed , Chip skirted the open ground and arrived at the shoulder of the young Frenchman . " Monsieur , " he said . Claude de Launy was suffering apparently from taut nerves . At any rate his shoulders twitched noticeably at the unexpectedness of the salutation . He turned and stared at his accoster . " Who are you ? " he demanded in a belligerent tone . " My name is George Louis Gorse and someday I will be a duke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure , are Monsieur Claude de Launy . " " Yes . "  | " I am a friend of Sir Theobald Gardiner 's and there is something I must say to you before you come to the point of exchanging shots . " " You have no right to be here . It is not my desire to speak further with you . " I come to give you a warning , " declared Chip grimly . " My friend is a great gentleman as well as a man of peace . If anything should happen to him , I declare my intention now to call you out myself . You will never get out of this country alive . That much I most solemnly swear . " " I regret the necessity of being here , " declared Claude de Launy . " But I am a man of honor . When he sent his seconds to me I had no alternative . " " Are you a good shot , monsieur ? " " I  --  I have some skill . " " Is it your intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at his questioner . His handsome features were pale and his lips showed a tendency to quiver . " He hates me , " he said in a low voice . " I can feel even at this distance the desire in him to bring my life to an end . To protect myself , I must aim well . " " I , standing off at one side , will be in as much danger from his marksmanshipas you will . My friend has had a pistol in his hands only once in his life . " " It is easy for you to say that ! " cried the Frenchman . " But how can I tell if there is truth in what you say ? " " I give you my word of honor , Monsieur de Launy , that you will be perfectly safe if you fire in the air . Allow me to point out also that it would be a fine and generous gesture on your part . You have given him mortal offense . You left him with no honorable course but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous . " The Frenchman 's face twitched spasmodically . " Go away ! " he cried . " You have no right here . You are breaking all the rules . I refuse to listen to another word . " Very much downcast at his lack of success , Young Chip made his way back to his carriage at the other end of the field . He watched the seconds as he did so . They had completed their discussions and were now measuring off the ground and placing the toe stones . The Comte de Lussac , a man of such strong Bonapartist convictions that he preferred exile to the immunity at home which had been tendered him , was acting for Claude de Launy . He had a deserved reputation for fairness and it was clear that he was not enjoying his role . The future peer heard him say to Dr. Sweetland , " Claude sets such value on his life that he will not accept as much as a fraction of one per cent of risk . " " That coward ! " thought Young Chip with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count with him but the safety of his own precious skin . " The principals , on receiving the word from the seconds , advanced to their stations . The Comte de Lussac , his handsome face set and grave , addressedthem in a tone which seemed to contain a note of pleading . " We have reached the moment , messieurs , when a reconciliation must be made or a compromise reached , if such is your desire . " A silence followed . The comte looked first at his man and then at Sir Theobald , who was holding his silver-mounted pistol with an awkwardness which bespoke unfamiliarity . He turned then to his fellow second . " Colonel Frisbie . " The colonel cleared his throat . " It is my duty , as second for the challenger , to ask the challenged party if he is prepared to make reparation in any other form . " Claude de Launy answered , " I see no way , m'sieur . " After a still longer silence the Comte de Lussac began to speak of the rules . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am permitted to so addressyou , you are to remain where you are . At the distance agreed upon , which is twenty yards . The toe stones are at your feet . You may rest your advanced foot on them but under no circumstances are you allowed to step closer . You have witnessed the placing of the white handkerchief at an equal distance between you . When my colleague draws it away by means of the cord attached to it , you will fire . " His voice rose . " One shot only , messieurs . After the first exchange , a consultation will be in order . " The sun came out with a suddenness which startled them all . Every line of the Horse above them became clear to the eye . A complete silence fell on the field . Frisbie looked at the baronet and then at Claude de Launy . With a brisk movement of his hand , he pulled at the cord . Sir Theobald raised his pistol and fired straight into the air . His opponent may not have rested on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , in the fullest sense of the word . But it seemed to the watchers that he was somewhat deliberate . There was the briefest interval between the two shots . Young Chip saw the baronet fall slowly forward on his face . He was at least twice as far away as the surgeon but he reached the prostrate figure on the damp turf almost as soon as the frantically hurrying Dr. Sweetland . The latter turned the inert form over and made an examination with hands which did not seem too steady . He was deliberate , however , in reaching a conclusion and it was several moments before he rose to his feet . " Gentlemen , " he said , " the bullet touched the heart . "  |p400Colonel  Frisbie drew in his lips and frowned uneasily . " Is there anything to be done ? " he asked . " Nothing , sir . Death was instantaneous . " The future Duke of Outland watched the members of the other party climb into their carriage with a haste which reflected a desire to remove themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lussac raised a hand in solemn greeting as they turned onto the road . Claude de Launy was leaning forward to speak to the driver and paid no attention to them . " He 'll get away , " said Young Chip to himself with the deepest bitterness . " By night he 'll be across the Channel and safe in Belgium . It 's certain he 'll never come back to England . " Aloud he said : " I want to call attention to the fact that the fellow wore a suit of green . He was taking no chances at all . " Dr. Sweetland looked at them , his manner solemn , his face white . " You must leave now . Both of you . Later you will be called for the inquest . What follows immediately is my unhappy responsibility . " Most young widows look well in their weeds , particularly when they have been at great pains to fashion them after the latest style . Isabelle had neglectednothing ; and she looked as prepossessing as ever , even though her brows were tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ormolu table at which she sat . Jonathan Bade , watching her intently , said to himself that nothing would ever affect her adversely . She took life , its misfortunes as well as its brighter sides , in her stride . It was a Sunday and so the lawyer was dressed in an appropriate black dress coat and a dark satin waistcoat . He had noticed that the hammercloth on the carriage at the front door ( Isabelle , apparently , was going on somewhereas soon as she was through with him ) was as black as sable . Isabelle laid the sheets down finally and gave him an approving smile . " I agree with everything you 've done , Jonathan , " she said . They had finally reached the stage of using first names . " What a grasping little beast that Cousin Dirk is ! You would almost think it was his money to begin with , that he had made it , instead of my dear papa , who more than tripled the Gardiner estates . Well , Master Dirk seems to have recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwillingly , however , " said Bade . " It was only when I hinted that the entail on Wimperley could be revived that he began to see reason , thep401dear fellow . You see , under entail the property would go to that dull clod of a Cousin Avery and that was something Dirk could not thole . The two cousins , with their thin shoulders and their spidery little legs , are like a pair of male sparrows chiffering away at each other on one branch . " The lawyer had been puzzled by the unusual silence of the room . Sir Theobald had been fond of canaries and had kept them in fine brass cages in all parts of the town house . None of them were left . Had Isabelle ordered them removed or had the butler carried them to the back quarters as a part of Sunday observance ? " As a matter of fact , Jonathan , " said Isabelle , " I 'm rather glad to be rid of Wimperley . It 's a cold big barracks and I despise all the neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiston talked to me for a whole evening on the use of manure in rose gardens ? " She folded over the sheets of the financial report and put them away in a purse bespangled with diamonds and pearls . She looked appreciatively about her . " This was what I wanted from the first . I love it . I really think it the most pleasant and convenient town house in all London , even if Mecklcnburgh Square is not quite as good an address as some others . " " Dear Cousin Dirk , " said Bade , " is not sure he can keep up Wimperley on his share of the income . He was quite dark and gloomy about it the last time I saw him . It 's only the insistence of his great fat wife , dear Cousin Dulcinea , which brought him to it . " Isabelle 's temper rose , creating a hard gleam in her eyes . " I hope they go smash ! " she said . " I hope the sheriff sells them out ! It would be pleasant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cupid border . " Observing a disapproving expression on his face , she gave her head a toss . " Now you 're angry with me . " " Of course I 'm angry with you , indulging your spite in this way . " " You do n't care for me any more . " The lawyer sighed . " I 'm afraid I care for you a very great deal . But in my own fashion , Cynara . " " You are always saying things like that , " pouted Isabelle . " You have never approved of me , have you ? " " No . I 've never approved of you . Strangely enough , I did n't disapprove of your conduct in the recent unpleasantness as much as you might expect . I happen to know the whole sad sequence of events . Your father wanted you and your husband to be kind to the exiled prince . It was your husband who introduced you to Louis Napoleon . It was in the prince 's house that you met the fellow De Launy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were caught in the web as much as the rest . I ca n't in all honesty lay the entire blame at your door . Except that you made such a rancid choice . "  | " I 'm afraid Claude behaved badly that -- that morning . " " From what I hear , he conducted himself like a rank coward . " Isabelle sighed . " I know . I 'm as severe with myself as you are . But he was so handsome . " " Now that we 're on the subject , I feel I should say that you 've been very lucky , " declared the lawyer . " The queen is too young to assert herself in such matters but , unless I 've misjudged her character , she will be very strict and stern later on . It has been your misfortune to be caught out in a  --  a little peccadillo , but I think you 'll succeed in living it down . Let me give you a piece of advice , my  --  my very dear Isabelle . " He lost control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show in his voice . " You are aiming high . You 'll never reach the heights to which you aspire if you do n't show the closest regard for what goes on in the mind of this new queen . " " You are quite right , Jonathan . I had already reached that conclusion . " The lawyer rose to leave but had not gone more than a few steps when he turned . " Isabelle , " he said , " why do n't you go to see your father ? He 's feeling the tension between you very much . " Isabelle looked both penitent and impatient . " Papa has been very angry with me . He still is . He sent me a note as soon as he heard of the duel . I thought he should have come to see me . Of course he happened to be out somewhere in the wilderness at the time and was too busy to return at once . It was a bitter letter and not very understanding . He put all the blame on me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started it himself . I felt quite hurt and I did n't answer him . I 've not been to see him since . " " I think the time has come to go . He misses you . In fact he talked about little else the last time I saw him . " " Did he ask you to speak to me ? " " He hinted that I might take it on myself . It seemed to me he was drinking too much . " Isabelle dismissed the last suggestion casually . " Drinking wo n't hurt Papa . He has the hardest head in England . Well , I suppose I must make the first move . I think he 's the only man in the world I really love . Husbands  --  well , that 's a different matter . I do n't believe it would ever be hard to get over a husband . There are so many to be had . Now that I am baring my innermost thoughts to you , Jonathan , I might as well tell you that I rather think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased . " I am very happy to hear you say that . But of course what you feel for me is a different matter also . I fall somewhere between a father and a husband  --  and much nearer the father relationship than the other , I 'm afraid . "  |p403Isabelle  was listening intently . " Perhaps , " she said . " But 1 think it 's more a case of having a quite special place of your own . " He asked with some hesitation : " Does it seem to you possible that circumstancesmight move me to a new position in your esteem ? Not quite so close to the fatherly side of things ? " She shook her head immediately . " No , Jonathan . You will always remain in your own special place . " " Then that is settled forever and a day . " He sighed deeply . Almost at once , however , his expression lightened . " Not forever . There is still the future and reincarnation . Will we come back to this earth in new guises ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a second time . If I walk again in a new era , it will be with a face I wo n't need to hide . You know , Isabelle , there will be great changes in the future . Other nations will rise to greatness . Germany , and perhaps even Russia with its uncounted millions of voiceless people . . . . If that happened  --  who knows ?  --  I might be a ruler in Muscovy and you a Slavic slave . " He indulged in a brief laugh . " This is foolish talk . Pay no attention to my absurdities , my dear Isabelle . " A church bell began to ring from somewhere close at hand . The street below was already filled with people walking arm in arm to the services . " I know , " said Jonathan , " that you have gone out very little since the tragedy . That has been wise but the time has come , I think , to face the world . You would find , at any rate , that the anonymity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butler entered the room in his Sunday black silk stockings and black plush breeches , carrying a tray on which reposed a single letter . " The gentleman who brought it , my lady , is below . He desires to see you for a few min-utes . " Isabelle sought her companion 's consent with a lift of her eyebrows and then proceeded to slit the envelope with a gold-handled knife . The lawyer was so fascinated by the grace of her movements as she did so that he failed to note the expression which took possession of her face as she read what the note contained . " Jonathan , what do you know about the Comte de Lussac ? " she asked after a moment . Bade brought himself back from a brief glimpse into a life where he would never be separated from the owner of the white hands . " The comte , of course , was Claude de Launy 's second , " he said . " He 's in his late fifties , I suspect ; a courtly and rather handsome man . They tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never met him . " " I understood he had left the country with Claude , " commented Isabelle , putting the note into her purse . " But I must have been misinformed . He isp404downstairs now . I 'll have to see him . Thanks , Jonathan , for getting all the estate tangles straightened out . I 'll sign the papers . " Isabelle found the Comte de Lussac standing before a portrait of some long-gone Gardiner in a huge wig . " Good morning , " she said , advancing toward him . " I am Lady Gardiner . Sit down , please . " The comte contented himself with a rather cold bow . " I come , milady , " he said , " to keep a promise made to M'sieur de Launy before his  --  his rather hurried departure . I bring a letter . " He produced it and held it out to her . " He gave me other instructions of which I shall speak later . " Isabelle took the letter in her hands , giving it no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprawling script . " Claude had no culture , " she thought . She held the envelope gingerly , not knowing what to do with it . Finally she laid it on the table beside which she had seated herself . " M'sieur le Comte , " she said , " I do n't think I want it . I know I wo n't be able to bring myself to read it . What , then , am I to do ? Will you think badly of me if I give it back to you ? " " No , milady , " answered the comte . " I think I can understand your reluctance to receiving it . But I would prefer not to take it . It may be a long time before I see that young man again . " He paused . " Are you certain you wish to be relieved of it ? " " Oh yes , yes ! " Isabelle shook her hands as though to rid them of the effects of contact with the letter . " I am afraid of it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then , " said the comte , " I shall tear it into small pieces for you and put them here on the hearth . Your butler can attend to burning them . I shall report what happened to it when I see him on the Continent . " Isabelle had been sure that seeing this particular caller would be a painfulduty but now she realized that she was liking him . He had the cool manners of the true aristocrat and the hint of an inner warmth which does not always go with the first . His face was long and , although his features lacked somewhat in regularity , he was rather handsome as Jonathan Bade had said . " I was told you left with him , " she said after a moment 's silence . " It was impossible for me to get away at once . I have property interests here in England and so there was much to be settled first . " He smiled rather bleakly . " Needless to state , I have been living  --  how is it you say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover . I am sailing tomorrow under an assumed name . " " I am sorry to have been the cause of so much inconvenience to you . " The comte was studying her face . " It is strange we have never met . You have been to see the prince many times . And I , as you perhaps know , am anp405ardent Bonapartist . I am devoting my life , my energies and my talents  --  such as they are  --  and my property , to the cause . I live only to see my country enjoying again the glory that the great emperor won for France . We may never meet again , milady , and so I have no excuse for venturing on a personalremark . But this I must say : I am gaining a different impression of you than I had when I came . " Isabelle said to herself , " He likes me better , " and was surprised to find that this pleased her very much . She did not want him to go away disliking her . " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and that your opinion of me then will be influenced less by what has happened . " The comte smiled . " I expect to be allowed to return . The worst mistake that anyone involved in a duel can make is to be caught . I intend not to make that mistake and so perhaps the law will come to holding a more lenientview toward me . I shall return when I can be sure that the mood of leniency has manifested itself . " " Colonel Frisbie will get off with a fine , we expect . " Isabelle 's tone carriedthe faintest hint of impatience . " He has no money at all , so I suppose it will have to be paid for him . " The comte was thinking , " Well , that much of what I was told about her is true . She 's like her father in money matters . What a pity ! " He was quite sorry to discover this flaw in her , for his admiration had been rising with each momerit spent in her company . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widows so attractive ? Especially when it has been demonstrated that they possess a certain degree of frailty ? It 's a good thing I am going to be away so long . I must succeed in forgetting this lovely little creature . " It was time for him to go . He said as he rose : " It is not necessary for me to convey any of the messages he confided to me since I know your feeling about his letter . I am particularly certain that you will have no message for me to take to him . " " No , Comte . The only message I could send "  --  she suddenly dropped all reserve  --  " would be that I hate him ! He did not need to kill my husband . Everything I have heard makes that clear . " She paused in an effort to get her emotions under better control . " I have told you how I feel but I would prefer not to have him know . I am certain , Comte , that I can depend on your tactfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand and this time he raised it to his lips . " I will return , " he said . He had already forgotten his resolution . " In the spring , perhaps . And it is my hope that I shall have the privilege of seeing you then . "  |p406It  is one of the greatest traits of the English people that they can oppose an innovation to the bitter end and then turn around , after it has been forced on them , and espouse the change , whatever it may be , with almost complete readiness . London had not opposed the railways as savagely as the people of the counties nor railed as angrily at Samuel Carboy ( who got most of the blame although he was no more than an investor in the new roads ) but all Londoners had expressed hatred for the " belching abominations " almostup to the time that regular services began . Already the Londoner who had a home in the western counties hurried cheerfully on Fridays to the terminal which the Great Western had erected at Paddington and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiltshire without a passing regret for the stagecoaches which had once served him . Julian Grace had been converted early , because he could get to his home in much quicker time . A porter would accompany him from the Admiralty to Paddington , carrying the supplies which he always took home with him . At Maidenhead , which was as far as the railway had been completed , he could take one of the connecting coach lines ( Carboy-owned and - operated , and always on time , of course ) and reach his place in no time at all , comparatively speaking . One Friday afternoon in early October he was standing on the platform with an assortment of bags and containers of all kinds . There was a neat basket filled with small parcels , the result of a list of needs which Freddie had pressed into his hands when he departed his home on Monday morning . There was a hamper with the delicacies which could be obtained only in the great city , bottles of special wine , jars of potted meats , and such exotic items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel of oysters and two bags containing his clothes . The responsibility of getting all these articles safely assembled and ready to be transferred to the train had kept him occupied so that he had paid no attention to a very gay party nearby . Someone , a great favorite obviously , was departing on this same train and friends had assembled to say good-by . He did not look in their direction until a familiar voice reached his ears . Itp407407was Isabelle 's voice . Turning quickly , he discovered that she was standing not more than a score of feet from him . She was looking , moreover , most slender and lovely , as lovely , he was sure , as when she had been sixteen . Her face was framed in fur and her arms were filled with hothouse flowers . A well-groomed man of perhaps fifty winters was standing beside her and monopolizing most of her attention . Julian recognized him as the Comte de Lussac , whom she was to marry within a few weeks , according to a recent announcement in the newspapers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to draw nearer with a somewhat imperious motion of her head . " Julian ! " she said when he had obeyed the summons , carrying a portfolio of navy papers under one arm and a newspaper in the other hand . " It 's a long time since I 've seen you . A very long time . " " Years , " said Julian rather tactlessly , and not caring . " You are married and have a family , " she went on . Her eyes took in the bags and parcels which belonged to him . " But I had no idea you were quite such a family man . " The comte had walked away and was talking with other members of theparty . Isabelle lowered her voice , " I 'm marrying again . Did you know ? " " Yes . I saw the announcement . I hope you 'll be very happy , Isabelle . " " I expect to be quite deliriously happy . " As a pause threatened to develop , he asked , " Will you continue to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it should be explained that her prospective husband 's full name was Hippolyte Raoul Rene de Beyne , Comte de Lussac  --  " is an ardent Bonapartist , as you probably know , but there 's nothing to prevent him from going back to France . He wo n't , of course , until that stupid king they have over there has been tumbled off and the Bonapartes restored . We expect it will be very soon . " Julian restrained himself from saying that it seemed highly improbable to him that she would ever get to France under those circumstances . A clangor of bells was giving warning that the train would soon be starting . The instinct of obedience was already developing among those who traveled by train and Julian was no exception . Without regret he ducked his head toward the beautiful woman he had once loved so devotedly , and turned hastily away to see that the porter got all his goods aboard . " Good-by , dear Julian , " Isabelle called after him in a voice which suggestedshe had been both surprised and hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat in the first coach ( there was a general belief that thep408rear coaches might be lost like the last skaters in a line of crack-the-whip ) and had the satisfaction of seeing that all his belongings had been carried in and deposited about him . It was not until then that he became conscious of something in the nature of a coincidence . Once , quite a number of years before , in fact within the first year that he and his wife had taken blissful possession of the house Timothy Ballard had found for them , he had caught a stagecoach on an early Friday morning and had turned over to the guard an identical assortment of baggage . There had been a basket full of the articles his passionately loved Freddie had wanted , a hamper filled as full of food as the one he was now taking and , actually , a barrel of oysters of exactly the same size . There had been nothing casual about that homeward trip , however . He had been filled with such intense anxiety that he had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the coaches started . This , of course , was before there had been such a thing as a railroad . He had been convinced they would be late in getting under way and had observed the slow movements of the driver and his aides with mounting indignation . He had consulted his watch three times in as many minutes and was no better informed as to the time than he had been before . " Look at them , the sluggards , the quatters ! " he had said to himself . " PerhapsI ought to explain to them that it 's a matter of life and death ! " They had started on time , of course , but there had been small consolation in that . Every delay on the road threw him into a frenzy of impatience . The cheerful sound of the conversations carried on at every stop almost drove him mad . It was not until they reached his stopping point that he was able to feel any sense of relief whatever ; and this was owing to the fact that he was greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " You 're in time , my boy , but it 's going to be a close-run thing . " " How is she ? " he had asked . " Bright and cheerful , " his father-in-law had answered . The latter was neither bright nor cheerful , however . Although he had been through the births of eight daughters , he had insisted on crossing the Atlantic to be on hand for this memorable occasion . He shook his head doubtfully and said to Julian : " He 's been here since nine this morning . The doctor , I mean . I ordered him from London on Wednesday and he 's been on call at the village inn ever since . Whenever I look at him I have doubts . He 's so damnably cheerful , he ca n't be the best one in London . He smiled and grinned and rubbed his hands when he arrived this morning , and I nearly sent off post haste for someone to replace him . "  |p409Julian  's thoughts turned backward and he found himself going over everythingwhich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor from London had been full of good cheer earlier , his mood had changed when Julian and his father-in-law reached Three Gables . He came down to speak to them immediately and his face looked grim as well as tired . " Not an easy case , Mr. Ballard , " he said , giving his bald dome a shake . " But it 's over , I am happy to tell you . Your daughter is resting well . " He glanced at Julian . " If you are Mr. Grace , sir , and I presume you are from the expression you wear , I wish to extend my congratulations . You are the father of a healthy boy . " They were standing in the hall and the afternoon sun was visible through a door at the rear . In his first feeling of exultation , Julian thought of rushing out through this door and shouting the wonderful news for the whole world to hear . He said to himself , " There must be champagne for dinner , the brisk , bubbling kind , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , and there must be fireworks on the hill . " Then a more sober reflectiontook possession of his mind . He pawed at the'doctor 's arm : " My wife , sir ! My wife ! Is she well ? Has she come through it safely ? " But the doctor was watching Timothy Ballard , whose emotional reaction was being more vigorously expressed . The new grandfather had taken the rusty sword which hung from a suit of armor in the hall and was waving it above his head . " A boy ! " he was shouting . " A son , a male heir in the Ballard Family at last ! Not a girl , beautiful though my daughters have always been , but a fine , strong boy . I wish my voice could be heard all the way to the island . I wish they were all listening to me in the clubs of Kingston . I wish they could drink my grandson 's health in every plantation . I wish they could sing in the slave quarters tonight , A son , Massa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " He dropped the sword on the floor with a loud clang and seized the doctor by the hand . " Sir , you must be the finest doctor in London ! I will give a written certificate to that effect to anyone who is interested . I shall proclaim you , sir , the greatest doctor in the whole world ! " He turned his face , which was almost of the redness of a beet , in his son-in-law 's direction . " Julian , 1 was promised a boy eight times . Old Dr. Cobbledick would always say to me , Sir , it must be a boy this time or I 'll refuse to believe in common justice or the law of averages ! ' But it never was.  |p410Eight  times it was a girl . I loved them all , of course , but Shakespeare himselfcould n't put into words the longing I had for just one son ! " A high and unmistakable wail reached them from the floor above . Julian clutched his father-in-law by the arm . He knew what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised in entreaty , expostulation , pain , relief , or whatever emotion it is which fills the souls of new arrivals in this vale of sorrow . He listened intently . The sound stopped . He turned pale and his hand trembled . But it began again , in greater volume if possible . " Sir , " he said , solemnly , to his father-in-law , " that sound you hear is being made by one Timothy Ballard Grace . " Mr. Ballard stared eagerly into Julian 's face . " Do you mean it , my boy ? " he asked . " Is this great honor to be mine ? " " It was settled long ago . Freddie and I talked it over many times . We agreed from the very first that if it was a boy he would be named after you . if a girl , Constance . " " Yes , yes , of course . Our poor dear Constance ! But I 'm happy , my boy , that it has turned out to be a son . When Noel drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said he knew it was going to be a boy . I demanded to know why he thought so . All he would say was , Ah doan ' know how , m's'r , but ah just does . ' " Julian had forgotten all about the new arrival , even though it happened to be his own son . Anxiety was plucking at his heartstrings again . IIe turned to the doctor . " When am I to be allowed to see my wife ? " he demanded . " You said she was resting . That frightens me . Are you sure she is all right ? " " Of course , of course . But as to when you may see her  --  well , soon , I think , soon . I must be certain that she 's feeling strong enough . " The young husband 's face turned white with fear . " Doctor , I ca n't stand this suspense . Are you holding something back ? Come , sir , I must know . I demand to know ! " The doctor seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Grace , " he stated finally , " there 's something I must tell you sooner or later . Perhaps the present would be the best time . Let 's step in here . " He led the way into a small room which Freddie used as a household office . It was a neat , white-painted apartment , lined with shelves for account books and small cabinets for papers . The desk was flat-topped and displayedno more than a pen and a container for ink and a tiny ship 's model which served as a paperweight . There was an excellent oil painting on the wall , a view of the kitchen garden , which the young wife had painted herself.  | " Now , Mr. Grace , you must n't go jumping to conclusions , " said Dr. Weatherly , over the rim of the glass of rum which Noel had placed in his hand . " Never insist on conclusions , sir ; erroneous things , conclusions , always . And never , never jump . You see , Mrs. Grace has had a rather bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't explain because , sir , it 's quite technical . Not now , at least . But there it was  --  and it 's not uncommon at all , sir . I must tell you this : a second venture of this kind would be a serious mistake . I feel I must say it straight out that your good lady would never survive bringing another child into the world . " Julian walked to the one window the little office contained . The room was wedged in between the front hall and the dining salon and it looked out on the drive , He was surprised to see Timothy Ballard running toward the road to intercept a passing vehicle . To tell the wonderful news , no doubt . " Dr. Weatherly , " he said , turning back to face the physician , " I wo n't mind about the blow to our plans  --  my wife , sir , hoped to have at least six children  --  if you can assure me that her health will be good . Will she have any permanent ill effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It will take her some time to get her strength back . But it will come back . I give you my most solemn assurances on that point . I have a slight suspicion  --  very slight , sir  --  that her lungs are a little delicate . But then , of course , most lungs are delicate . " " Does she know what  --  what you have just told me ? " The doctor nodded reluctantly . " I 'm afraid , sir , that she does . I make it a point not to tell them at first . Sometimes they go into hysterics or cry themselves into a bad state when they hear . But it seems that Mrs. Grace has a quick pair of ears . She caught a chance remark I made to the nurse and she took right hold of it , sir , and in no time at all she had it out of me . " The proportions of the catastrophe had at last come home to Julian . He took a chair and sat in deep silence for several moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the asking of questions on such a sacred matter most difficult . " How did she take it , Doctor ? " " Bravely , sir . And quietly . She has n't said much since ; but there was no weeping or repining or laying of blame . " " May I see her now ? " The doctor gave the point some thought . Then he rose to his feet and drained the glass . " I 'll go up and have a look at her first . If it seems wise , I 'll come to the head of the stairs and nod to you . If she asks you how much you know , say that I told you . She must n't be allowed to tell you herself.
