As the black B-26 turned out to sea after bombing the Indonesian port of Amboina , guns opened up from ground installations and government patrol boats in the harbor . The B-26 shuddered , and two men bailed out before it died in a splash of sea spray . One , an Indonesian rebel , was fished out of the water . The other got his parachute fouled in a palm tree on a coral reef , and , in freeing himself , fell to the ground and broke his right thigh . For the Indonesians , he was an impressive catch . His name : Allen Lawrence Pope . Nationality : U.S.A. Florida-born Allen Pope , 29 , was an ex-Air Force first lieutenant , who won the D.F.C . in the Korean war , became a crack pilot with Claire Chennault 's Formosa-based Civil Air Transport , flew transports over Dien-bienphu in the Indo-China war . <P> Pilot Pope was clearly not the only U.S. flier involved in Indonesia 's civil war . From Zamboanga , in the southern Philippines , last week came word that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the dirt airport to refuel and continue on their way to or from rebel-held Menado . The planes reportedly had Nationalist Chinese markings covered over with hasty coats of paint , their pilots were Chinese and Americans from Chennault 's swashbuckling CAT , the cargoes were rumored to be guns and munitions . But the continued string of rebel defeats and the new posture of cordial friendship between the U.S. and the Indonesian government of President Sukarno has had its effect : not a single Menado-bound plane has landed at Zamboanga since May 1 . <P> In Djakarta , in evident eagerness to keep alive the new friendship with the U.S. , Sukarno made no big show of the prize captive , but left the announcement to be made by the military commander at Amboina , Lieut . Colonel Herman Pieters . Pieters was himself briefly a member of the rebel colonels . He quoted Pilot Pope as saying that he had been hired by the rebels at $10,000 a month and had flown most of the destructive missions over East Indonesia in which foreign and native shipping was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope , a serious and not a swashbuckling type , had originally joined the rebels because he believed Indonesia was " turning Communist , " said Pieters . He had now changed his mind and " expressed regret for what he had done . " He will be tried by a military court . <P> U.S. Ambassador Howard Jones issued his regrets that an American " paid soldier of fortune " had become involved in the fighting , and the Indonesians seemed willing to let it go at that .
