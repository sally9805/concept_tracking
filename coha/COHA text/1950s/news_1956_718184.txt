txt Rebuilding a little New Hampshire chapel on the grounds of Concord Academy has been the summer project of seven individuals devoted to the school . Two years ago the quaint ok Baptist Chapel in Barnstead N.H. , went on sale for the sum of $1,500 . " The pews alone were worth that much , " said Mrs. Livingston Hall , headmistress of the school , whose primary concern at that time was new pews for the present makeshift chapel , once the loft of a barn . Even though Mrs. Hall had just that past week purchased new pews , sale of the chapel was investigated . The pews could not be bought separately and so the entire church was purchased by the headmistress with the hope that she could interest others in the need of a chapel for the school  --  a need which often had been discussed by the pupils . For the past two years the problem of how to move the chapel to Concord has been wrestled with . One architect 's plans for the chapel ran the cost of moving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned . Tent Pitched by Chapel Earlier this spring , William Eddy , an English teacher at the academy , said to Mrs. Hall , " You know , I 'd love to spend my summer working on that church . " This was all the encouragement Mrs. Hall needed . She and her husband , who is vice-dean of the Harvard Law School , previou " Sly had had the experience of tearing down and rebuilding an old house at Sandwich on Cape Cod . As soon as classes were over J and school was closed in June , Mr. Eddy and his wife set out for New Hampshire and pitched their tent on the chapel grounds . Mr. and Mrs. Hall followed July 2 , with the heavy equipment . The Halls ' camping trailer served as a " chuck wagon , " complete with table and awning . the entire crew , in addition to he Halls and Eddys , consisted if Miss Doreen Young , head of he English Department ; Conrad White , a friend of the group , and Miss Belinda Burley , a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the : hurch . Rollicking Operation " When we first started taking the chapel apart we did not know what we , would find , " Mrs. Hall said , " but Bill , whO haS masterminded this whole thing , kept insisting we had nothing to lose . " Everyone , she said , decided that if they were not successful , we would have had the fun of being together . Ripping down the plaster was a ? rollicking experience , the way the headmistress tells it . First a hole was made in a section of the wall near the top . Then a chain was dropped down behind the wall and fished out through another hole made in the wall near the floor . To the end of the chain was attached a heavy rope . All seven of them " got on the end of the rope and gave a great heave . " Down came the plaster with a crash . At the end of a day of this kind of labor the crew would take to the brook to wash up . The church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolutionary War experience of many of ifs early male members . The story goes that many of the townsmen were stationed at Schenectady , N.Y. , but because the word was difficult to pronounce , the church was named , " Snackerty Brook Church . " Fine Weather Prevailed As the tearing down of the church got under way , townspeople faced the demolition with mixed emotions . Some resented the removal of this old landmark , although , as Mrs. Hall said , " they had done nothing to keep the church from falling apart . " Most of the residents , however , expressed great pleasure that the chapel was going to be used by a school . Work on the church progressed " rapidly and more easily than we had hoped for , " the headmistress said . Excellent weather had prevailed until the day before the last section was to come down . Then it rained . The rain made removing the pegs most difficult . On July 22 the chapel was a mass of lumber at one end of the beautiful landscaped grounds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detailed sketches made to designate where the numbered pieces were to go . Roof trusses were left intact and brought by crane to Concord , together with the large stones used in the foundation . Even the door stones were salvaged , as well as the original handsome pews . Old Wives ' Tale Windows of the chapel are said to be larger than those found in the average church of that day . An old wives ' tale records that when the church was being built , there was one member who did not contribute as much as it was felt his pocketbook could afford . He was in the window business and finally agreed to supply the win dows . The church took advantage of the situation and ordered the largest windows available . On its new location at Concord Academy , the chapel is beginning to take shape under the guidance of carpenter , Fred Bishop . " At first , " Mrs. Hall said , " he did not want to work with amateurs but now he is like a father to all of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was when the crew started work on it . The alteration is justified , it was explained , because the front of the church already had been tampered with . About six feet from the front door , two more door stones were discovered . In tearing down this six-foot section a hodgepodge of small pieces of lumber was found , showing that the workmanship on the addition was not as expert as that done by the original craftsmen . Vestibule Planned A vestiouie is to oe acme ? in the Concord restoration . Among the advantages offered by this additional space will be room for two stairways to a , small gallery over the entrance . The walls will be plastered and the timbers exposed . Looking up through the large beams to the open sky , Mrs. Hall said , " We have rubbed and oiled every one of those beams ? we being the women 's auxiliary " of the crew . Present plans call for putting back all of the material brought from New Hampshire to make the building weatherproof .

Estimated cost of the completed building is under $20,000 . All of the crew echo Mr. Hall 's words when he said : " It has been a most satisfying summer . "
