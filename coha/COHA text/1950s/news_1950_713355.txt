" Erickson is enabled to cornmtmicate with operators of his gambling business from Bikers Island Penitentiary where he has been a prisoner since last June . The obvious inference of what Erickson is doing in behalf of umpellitteri may be drawn from anyone . " Albert Williams , Commissioner of Correction , last night denied Mr. Corsi 's charges , asserting that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " a bit on the harsh side . " He described the Corsi charges of favoritism as " willful , vicious and such calculated lies as to make him additionally unfit to hold even the public office he now has with the state .

" I now assert that Erickson is a pampered prisoner in Rikers Island Penitentiary and enjoys favors , immunities and privileges that can be obtained only in one of two ways : either through the use of money or through the exertion of political pressure on his behalf by the very ? top power in the city government . " Erickson 's operations- ' involve very large sums of money and deals with other powerful gamblers scattered throughout the country . Their arrangements with him are made in advance and in great part have been conducted over the long-distance ' telephone . " I charge that the privileges unlawfully granted ' to - Erickson enable him to meet in private with associates- in his gambling enterprises and to have access to a telephone in the prison at times when he could- be in communication with the gamblers scattered throughout - the country ; with whom he has conducted vast operations over many years . " In a broadcast last night , Mr. Corsi said that Frank Sampson , the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impellitteri in the Mayoralty race .
