THE GOOD SHEPHERD ( 310 pp. ) -C . S. Forester-Little , Brown ( $3.95 ) . <P> This book again proves that Cecil Scott Forester is the best living writer about the sea . It is a war novel ( first published in LIFE ) that neither whines nor rails nor waves flags , but sticks tersely to its theme . Its hero , Commander George Krause , U.S.N. , is indeed a good shepherd . His flock is a convoy of 37 merchant ships zigzagging across the Atlantic in 1942 . To herd them safely to harbor in England , Krause has only four escort vessels , one of which he personally commands . Almost as serious as his weakness in ships is his own inexperience ; this is his first taste of war , although he is an Annapolis man with 20 years of routine duty behind him . The serious-minded son of a Lutheran minister , unlucky in marriage , he is now to be tested as life has never tested him before . <P> When the submarine wolf pack strikes , Krause 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty that overcome fatigue and everything the subs can throw at him . For 48 terrible hours he fights his destroyer and directs as exciting a battle as Author Forester 's famed Horatio Hornblower ever experienced under sail . In the desperate game of hit-and-run , Krause is frequently fooled by the U-boat commanders , but as he fights , he learns . Ships are torpedoed and men are left to drown because to try to save them would mean to endanger more lives . Moral anguish , physical suffering and fatigue bring Krause to the edge of senselessness . The commander 's personal battle , fought on the borderline of human endurance , is even more impressive than the naval action . Author Forester has written a war novel whose real hero is the concept of duty .
