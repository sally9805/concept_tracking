Hillsdale , the four-year-old bay colt that is suddenly the hottest piece of horseflesh in U.S. racing , flashed across the finish line to win the $177,150 Santa Anita Maturity . In a box near the finish line , a huge bulk of a man broke down and cried for joy . At 3:30 next morning , flushed with triumph and celebration , Clarence Whitted ( " Big Smitty " ) Smith , 40 , wandered out to Hillsdale 's barn , delivered a rambling oration to his horse . <P> <P> " The horse seemed bored , but Smitty seemed happy , so what 's the difference ? " said an onlooker . Says Smitty : " You got ta have guts . That 's what makes horses and athletes great . Guts is sports and sports is my life . " <P> Big Smitty runs his own $2,500,000-a-year engineering firm in Detroit , but he is seldom there . He fishes in Bimini , skis in Norway , once slept with Hillsdale in a Santa Anita stable . His need for guts came early . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid who was forever picking fights with his grade-school classmates , later channeled his energies into football in Massillon , Ohio . His athletic promise faded tragically when , at 15 , he came in contact with a high-tension wire . The accident mangled his left hand , severely creased his skull , left him incapacitated for two years . Since then , Big Smitty has flung his vast enthusiasm into an overwhelming admiration for other athletes . <P> Helping Hand . Fighters are his particular passion . " If I had n't grabbed that wire , I 'd have probably been a third-rate pug myself , " he says cheerfully . Joe Louis and Billy Conn are among his cronies , and Carmen Basilic , onetime middleweight champion , is a hero . " Oh , that Basilio ! " he enthuses . " Did you see the way his lamp went out in that last Robinson fight ? Why , he 's all guts . That little bastard will never go hungry as long as I 'm eating . " <P> Smitty 's generosity is as big as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouts in Detroit ( 1958 loss : $60,000 ) , he finds work for a ragtag stable of fighters , gives them handouts and a chance to show what they can do . His payroll bulges with ex-pugs . One of his engineers is a former light heavyweight . A once promising middleweight serves as an office manager . A prelim fighter is carried as a janitor . <P> A Winner . The only things Smitty loves as much as boxers are horses . " Give me the big horse and the big fighter , " he cries . Smitty bought his first horse in 1947 with $700-a no-good hayburner named Roscoe Goose . In the next ten years he had more than a dozen others , none of them first-rate until , in late 1957 , he bought Hillsdale for $25,000 . No one was impressed . Two of Smitty 's friends turned down the chance to buy a share in the horse . Jockey Eddie Arcaro politely declined the chance to ride him . But here and there , Hillsdale , a handsome horse of undistinguished bloodlines , began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been beaten , has whipped such headliners as Jewel 's Reward and Round Table . In all , Smitty 's $25,000 horse has won him a tidy $265,000.
