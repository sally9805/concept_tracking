txt The New York Public Library was involved in a television controversy last night after having withdrawn its name from a program that assailed war as a means of solving man 's difficulties . Morris Hadley , president of the library , said that he had ordered removal of a screen credit for the library on the ground that the show ran counter to the library 's established policy of not taking a position in " sensitive areas . " The sh ... o.r , entitled " The Faces of War , " was presented locally from 3:30 to 4:30 P. M. over WCBS-TV and was billed as an observance of Veterans Day . The program was pro duced by the Metropolitan Educational Television Associa- tion , chartered by the New York State Board of Regents to offer educational television in the metropolitan area . The presentation featured Mark Van Doren , Pulitzer Prize winner in biography , as narrator and script collaborator . Other participants included Norman Cousins , editor of The Saturday Review ; Dr. Margaret Mead , anthropologist , and James Jones , author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the library had long adhered to a policy of not entering " sensitive areas " in the belief that this was the best method of assuring the library maximum freedom to stock books reflect ing all sides of controversial issues .. He confirmed that he had communicated on Saturday with William S. Paley , chairman of the board of the Columbia Broadcasting System , to make sure that the library was disassociated from the venture . 11The ' library had contributed to the cost of the program , reportedly $1,500 . Mr. Cousins said after the program that he was " astounded by the action of the library and delighted that the officers of C. B. S. did not yield to the library 's stern disapproval . " Security Threat Mentioned He said that he had been informed that the library had advanced the view that " the national security would be jeopardized " by presentation of the program . He said that a library should be the first institution to foster " the widest circulation of big ideas . " Dr. Mead said she had not been aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no doubt of the program 's anti-war sentiments . Dr. Alan W. Brown , president of the television association and former president of Hobart College , noted that the script had enjoyed approval of library officials while it was in preparation , but he otherwise declined to elaborate on details of the controversy . " I 'm terribly glad we were on the air , " he said . " It seems to me one of the issues Ls whether we are going to have educational TV or not . If TV is to have educational force , it must explore controversiarareas . " Merle Jones , president of the C. B. S. television division , said that Mr. Hadley and Arthur A. Houghton Jr. , a library trustee , had informed C. B. S. on Saturday of their feelings . " After they received the script , they wanted their association withdrawn , " he said . The script , on which Harding Lemay , staff associate of the American Book Publishers Council , collaborated with Mr. Van . Doren , provided for the reading of excerpts from Euripides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Walt Whitman . All the , excerpts were directed , to the general theme of the wastefulness and inhumanity of war . The panel discussion end , ed in a joint appeal for recognition that peace was a greater and more arduous adventure than war . A series of folk songs by Cynthia Gooding were also presented , Mr. Hadley said that whether the program was anti-war or pro-war had nothing to do with the library 's action . He said the advance script had included a notation that the program was " prepared for the New York Library . " " Our position is that we have books on every side of every subject , but we do n't prepare or put out anything , " he said . " The library has had wonderful freedom , and we think we have nearly every book in the world , a lot of them ' on controversial issues . " A long time ago we found that in sensitive areas it is wisest for the library not to take a position . In any sensitive area we try to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The product is yours , not ours ' . " Mr. Houghton declined to discuss his role in the television dispute . Under the original plans the Public Library was to receive joint billing with the television association and WCBS-TV as co-sponsors of the public service feature .
