THE MORNING WATCH ( 120 pp. ) - James Agee-Houghton M/ffl/n ( $2.25 ) . <P> <P> For twelve-year-old Richard , wakening in the dormitory of his Anglo-Catholic church school in the Tennessee hills , the day had begun with a soul-shaming failure . He had vowed to stay awake all night to share somehow Christ 's agony , but before midnight he had fallen asleep . Now , as Father Whitman went from cot to cot waking the boys chosen for the next Good Friday watch , it was nearly 4 a.m. , and Richard was suffused with the knowledge of his Lord 's ordeal . <P> " O God , he silently prayed , in solemn and festal exaltation : make me to know Thy suffering this day . O make me to know Thy dear Son 's suffering this day . " <P> Tincture of Pride . In The Morning Watch , Writer James Agee has come close to a small triumph ; he has pierced the protective shell of a boy 's personality and exposed the religious exaltation of the boy without once falling into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deepest thoughts and feelings are disturbed by weak flesh and childish imaginings : he is kneeling , and his knees and back hurt , disturbing the purity of his devotions ; he remembers his silly effort at self-mortification through eating worms ; he imagines himself upon the cross and hearing the school 's best athlete whisper , " Jesus that kid 's got guts . " And dismayed because every other thought seems tinctured with pride , he fervently prays : " O God forgive me ! forgive me if you can stand to ! " <P> After the watch , Richard and two others play hooky and head for a swim . The shift from the atmosphere of the chapel to the outdoor freshness of a spring morning is achieved in descriptive language of unusual beauty : " Everywhere among the retreating trees strayed sober clouds of evergreen and mild clouds of blossom and the dreaming laurels , and everywhere , as deep into the stunned woods as they could see , layer above unwavering layer , the young leaves led like open shale ; while , against their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim itself and the boyish killing of a snake afterwards are described in flashing language . But it is just here that Author Agee falters , clothing the action with symbols for which he furnishes no clear keys . As Richard and the others march back to school to face their punishment for playing hooky , Agee 's final meaning lags somewhere behind , among the Freudian trees . <P> Images of Death . Yet throughout The Morning Watch , Author Agee has achieved many things with a fine economy of language : an adolescent 's mysticism , sliced through with normal childishness ; a shy boy 's painful awareness of his own inadequacy among blustering , sometimes grossly obscene classmates ; the confused images of the Lord 's death and the death of Richard 's own father . <P> All of this is handled with great sympathy and written as few living U.S. writers can write . In his first book of fiction , Author Agee ( Let Us Now Praise Famous Men ) has written prose that arouses the emotional responses of first-rate poetry .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
