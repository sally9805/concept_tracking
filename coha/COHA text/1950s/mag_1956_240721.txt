Dear TIME-Reader : <P> <P> CANADA Deskman Art White was back in TIME 'S news bureau last week after his tenth visit to Canadian bureaus and correspondents in three years . This time White traveled 10,000 miles in four weeks , zigzagging across the country from Quebec to Vancouver , from Churchill on Hudson Bay to Whitehorse in the Yukon . His purpose : to extend TIME 'S coverage of that booming nation . <P> " Signing up new correspondents is necessary not only to keep abreast of Canada 's economic and cultural growth but to anticipate and stay ahead of that growth , " said White . " It is not enough to have correspondents in the centers of population ; more and more significant news is being made out in the bush , in mining towns , in tough , hard-to-reach areas where men are digging , farming , lumbering and gathering the riches of a rich land . " <P> Typical of such frontier news sources , he discovered , is Churchill ( pop . about 1,100 ) , a fast-growing grain port and supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill is a cold-weather proving ground for Canadian and U.S. military weapons , gear and clothing , and has been designated for next year as an observation station for the International Geophysical Year . <P> Traveling by plane , train , boat and bus , White met a wide cross section of the population and was pleased to hear how many consider TIME their principal source of world news . Said a technician on the Mid-Canada Warning Line , who gets his copy of the magazine by helicopter : " There 's a scramble when TIME comes in-and all along the line on the way in other guys have been reading it . Some of ' em cut out stories they like , and that 's the worst part . I 'll say this , though-it may arrive in tatters but it arrives . " <P> Across the country , readers repeatedly expressed surprise at the scope and accuracy of TIME 'S reports on remote regions of Canada . White 's explanation was simple enough : much of TIME 'S local news from Canada is reported by top Canadian newsmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers ; some of them , like Ralph Daly , editorial writer for the Vancouver Sun , have been reporting for us as long as twelve years . <P> To add another northern tier to this sort of first-hand regional coverage , White on his latest trip signed on new stringers to report to TIME from Churchill , The Pas , Grande Prairie , Whitehorse , Prince George and Fort William . These bring the number of part-time correspondents ( in addition to TIME 'S three full-time bureaus in Ottawa , Toronto and Montreal ) to an all-time high of 35 . <P> Cordially yours ,
