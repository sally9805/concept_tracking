All painting has eye appeal , and most of it can be lived with . <P> The art of architects and of landscape architects is more fundamental : it is meant to be lived in . One of the top artists America has produced , Frederick Law Olmsted , worked entirely with hills and hollows , trees and grass . He designed fine parks for Boston , Detroit , San Francisco and Chicago , made Manhattan 's Central Park his masterpiece . <P> Plans for Central Park were laid just a century ago . Olmsted spent most of the rest of his life making the dream come true . His aim was " to complement . . . the beauty of the town with the beauty of the fields , the meadow , the prairie , of the green pastures and still waters . " It was not easy . The region chosen for the park was an unsightly swamp laced with bald rock ridges and pimpled with squatters ' shacks . To see it whole and make it new required optimism and an unwavering mind 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Olmsted designed Central Park for scenic richness and relaxation . He used its rocks as a kind of underpainting for his composition , and green verdure as a final glaze . He divided it with lakes and streams , wove it together with curving paths and driveways , pointed up its natural loveliness with small , well-placed buildings designed by Calvert Vaux , an English architect . <P> Olmsted foresaw that the " town " would soon surround his creation , installed four cross-park driveways . A touch of inspiration led him to sink the driveways below ground-level and thus preserve the park 's visual harmony . Fighting off the people who wanted to embellish the park with opera houses , race tracks , cathedrals and fire stations was more difficult but almost as successful . Today , the one notable encroacher on the park 's priceless real estate is the Metropolitan Museum of Art . <P> Central Park is used and enjoyed each year by some 30 million people-dowagers walking their dogs , prizefighters doing their morning road work , oldsters drowsing in the sun , people of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indians , nursemaids plying the baby-carriage trade . It is a huge , beautiful-backyard for Manhattan 's harried hive-dwellers.
