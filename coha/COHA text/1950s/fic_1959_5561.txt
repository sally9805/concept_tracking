Illustration MUTINEER By ROBERT J. SHEA For every weapon there was a defense , but not against the deadliest weapon  --  man himself ! Raging , Trooper Lane hovered three thousand feet above Tammany Square . The cool cybrain surgically implanted in him was working on the problem . But Lane had no more patience . They 'd sweat , he thought , hating the chill air-currents that threw his hovering body this way and that . He glared down at the three towers bordering on the Square . He spat , and watched the little white speck fall , fall . Lock me up in barracks . All I wanted was a little time off . Did I fight in Chi for them ? Damn right I did . Just a little time off , so I should n't blow my top . Now the lid 's gone . He was going over all their heads . He 'd bowled those city cops over like paper dolls , back at the Armory . The black dog was on Lane 's back . Old Mayor himself was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Mayor the CinC of the Newyork Troopers ? The humming paragrav-paks embedded beneath his shoulder blades held him motionless above Newyork 's three administrative towers . Tammany Hall . Mayor 's Palace . Court House . Lane cursed his stupidity . He had n't found out which one was which ahead of time . They keep Troopers in the Armory and teach them how to fight . They do n't teach them about their own city , that they 'll be fighting for . There 's no time . From seven years old up , Troopers have too much to learn about fighting . The Mayor was behind one of those thousands of windows . Old cybrain , a gift from the Trooper surgeons , compliments of the city , would have to figure out which one . Blood churned in his veins , nerves shrieked with impatience . Lane waited for the electronic brain to come up with the answer . Then his head jerked up , to a distant buzz . There were cops coming . Two black paragrav-boats whirred along the translucent underside of Newyork 's anti-missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Damn fast ! The cybrain jolted an impulse through his spine . Lane somersaulted . Cybrain had taken charge of his motor nerves . Lane 's own mind was just along for the ride . * * * * * His body snapped into a stiff dive position . He began to plummet down , picking up speed . His mailed hands glittered like arrowheads out in front . They pointed to a particular window in one of the towers . A predatory excitement rippled through him as he sailed down through the air . It was like going into battle again . A little red-white-and-green flag fluttered on a staff below the window . Whose flag ? The city flag was orange and blue . He shrugged away the problem . Cybrain knew what it was doing . The little finger of his right hand vibrated in its metal sheath . A pale vibray leaped from the lensed fingertip . Breakthrough ! The glasstic pane dissolved . Lane streamed through the window . The paragrav-paks cut off . Lane dropped lightly to the floor , inside the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl screamed . Lane 's hand shot out automatically . A finger vibrated . Out of the corner of his eye , Lane saw the girl fold to the floor . There was no one else in the room . Lane , still in a crouch , chewed his lip . The Mayor ? His head swung around and he peered at the 3V set . He saw his own face . " Lashing police with his vibray , " said the announcer , " Lane broke through the cordon surrounding Manhattan Armory . Two policemen were killed , four others seriously injured . Tammany Hall has warned that this man is extremely dangerous . Citizens are cautioned to keep clear of him . Lane is an insane killer . He is armed with the latest military weapons . A built-in electronic brain controls his reflexes  --  " " At ease with that jazz , " said Lane , and a sheathed finger snapped out . There was a loud bang . The 3V screen dissolved into a puddle of glasstic . The Mayor . Lane strode to the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane 's mailed hand snapped open a pouch at his belt . He flipped a fist-sized cube to the floor . The force-bomb " exploded "  --  swelled or inflated , really , but with the speed of a blast . Lane glanced out the window . A section of the energy globe bellied out from above . It shaded the view from his window and re-entered the tower wall just below . Now the girl . He turned back to the room . " Wake up , outa-towner . " He gave the blonde girl a light dose of the vibray to slap her awake . " Who are you ? " she said , shakily . Lane grinned . " Trooper Lane , of the Newyork Special Troops , is all . " He threw her a mock salute . " You from outa-town , girlie . I ai n't seen a Newyork girl with yellow hair in years . Orange or green is the action . Whatcha doing in the Mayor 's room ? " * * * * * The girl pushed herself to her feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very out-of-town . She held herself straight and her blue-violet eyes snapped at him . " What the devil do you think you 're doing , soldier ? I am a diplomat of the Grassroots Republic of Mars . This is an embassy , if you know what that means . " " I do n't , " said Lane , unconcerned . " Well , you should have had brains enough to honor the flag outside this window . That 's the Martian flag , soldier . If you 've never heard of diplomatic immunity , you 'll suffer for your ignorance . " Her large , dark eyes narrowed . " Who sent you ? " " My cybrain sent me . " She went openmouthed . " You 're Lane . " " I 'm the guy they told you about on the 3V . Where 's the Mayor ? Ai n't this his place ? " " No . No , you 're in the wrong room . The wrong building . That 's the Mayor 's suite over there . " She pointed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite . If you want the Mayor you 'll have to go over there . " " Whaddaya know , " said Lane . " Cybrain did n't know , no more than me . " The girl noticed the dark swell of the force-globe . " What 's that out there ? " " Force-screen . Nothing gets past , except maybe a full-size blaster-beam . Keeps cops out . Keeps you in . You anybody important ? " " I told you , I 'm an ambassador . From Mars . I 'm on a diplomatic mission . " " Yeah ? Mars a big city ? " She stared at him , violet eyes wide . " The planet Mars . " " Planet ? Oh , that Mars . Sure , I 've heard of it  --  you got ta go by spaceship . What 's your name ? " " Gerri Kin . Look , Lane , holding me is no good . It 'll just get you in worse trouble . What are you trying to do ? " " I wan na see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from fighting in Chi , Gerri . We won . They got a new Mayor out there in Chi . He takes orders from Newyork . " Gerri Kin said , " That 's what the force-domes did . The perfect defense . But also the road to the return to city-states . Anarchy . " Lane said , " Yeah ? Well , we done what they wanted us to do . We did the fighting for them . So we come back home to Newyork and they lock us up in the Armory . Wo n't pay us . Wo n't let us go nowhere . They had cops guarding us . City cops . " Lane sneered . " I busted out . I wan na see the Mayor and find out why we ca n't have time off . I do n't play games , Gerri . I go right to the top . " Lane broke off . There was a hum outside the window . He whirled and stared out . The rounded black hulls of the two police paragrav-boats were nosing toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bows . A loudspeaker shouted into the room : " Come out of there , Lane , or we 'll blast you out . " " You ca n't , " Lane called . " This girl from Mars is here . " " I repeat , Lane  --  come out or we 'll blast you out . " Lane turned to the girl . " I thought you were important . " * * * * * She stood there with her hands together , calmly looking at him . " I am . But you are too , to them . Mars is millions of miles away , and you 're right across the Square from the Mayor 's suite . " " Yeah , but  --  " Lane shook his head and turned back to the window . " All right , look ! Move them boats away and I 'll let this girl out ! " " No deal , Lane . We 're coming in . " The police boats backed away slowly , then shot straight up , out of the line of vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the long , gleaming barrel of a blaster cannon caught the dim light filtering down through Newyork 's Shell . The cannon trundled into the Square on its olive-drab , box-shaped caterpillar mounting and took up a position equidistant from the bases of the three towers . Now a rumble of many voices rose from below . Lane stared down to see a large crowd gathering in Tammany Square . Sound trucks were rolling to a stop around the edges of the crowd . The people were all looking up . Lane looked across the Square . The windows of the tower opposite , the ones he could see clearly , were crowded with faces . There were white dot faces on the balcony that Gerri Kin had pointed out as the Mayor 's suite . The voice of a 3V newscaster rolled up from the Square , reechoing against the tower walls . " Lane is holding the Martian Ambassador , Gerri Kin , hostage . You can see the Martian tricolor behind his force-globe . Police are bringing up blaster cannon . Lane 's defense is a globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerial attack . " Lane grinned back at Gerri Kin . " Whole town 's down there . " Then his grin faded . Nice-looking , nice-talking girl like this probably cared a lot more about dying than he did . Why the hell did n't they give him a chance to let her out ? Maybe he could do it now . Cybrain said no . It said the second he dropped his force-screen , they 'd blast this room to hell . Poor girl from Mars , she did n't have a chance . Gerri Kin put her hand to her forehead . " Why did you have to pick my room ? Why did they send me to this crazy city ? Private soldiers . Twenty million people living under a Shell like worms in a corpse . Earth is sick and it 's going to kill me . What 's going to happen ? " Lane looked sadly at her . Only two kinds of girls ever went near a Trooper  --  the crazy ones and the ones the city paid . Why did he have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked ? Now that she was showing a little less fear and anger , she was talking straight to him . She was good , but she was n't acting as if she was too good for him . " They 'll start shooting pretty quick , " said Lane . " I 'm sorry about you . " " I wish I could write a letter to my parents , " she said . " What ? " " Did n't you understand what I said ? " " What 's a letter ? " " You do n't know where Mars is . You do n't know what a letter is . You probably ca n't even read and write ! " * * * * * Lane shrugged . He carried on the conversation disinterestedly , professionally relaxed before battle . " What 's these things I ca n't do ? They important ? " " Yes . The more I see of this city and its people , the more important I realize they are . You know how to fight , do n't you ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Listen . They been training me to fight since I was a little kid . Why should n't I be a great little fighter ? " " Specialization , " said the girl from Mars . " What ? " " Specialization . Everyone I 've met in this city is a specialist . SocioSpecs run the government . TechnoSpecs run the machinery . Troopers fight the wars . And ninety per cent of the people do n't work at all because they 're not trained to do anything . " " The Fans , " said Lane . " They got it soft . That 's them down there , come to watch the fight . " " You know why you were kept in the Armory , Lane ? I heard them talking about it , at the dinner I went to last night . " " Why ? " " Because they 're afraid of the Troopers . You men did too good a job out in Chi . You are the deadliest weapon that has ever been made . You . Single airborne infantrymen ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's the men that win the wars . " " Yes , but people had forgotten it until the SocioSpecs of Newyork came up with the Troopers . Before the Troopers , governments concentrated on the big weapons , the missiles , the bombs . And the cities , with the Shells , were safe from bombs . They learned to be self-sufficient under the Shells . They were so safe , so isolated , that national governments collapsed . But you Troopers wiped out that feeling of security , when you infiltrated Chi and conquered it . " " We scared them , huh ? " Gerri said , " You scared them so much that they were afraid to let you have a furlough in the city when you came back . Afraid you Troopers would realize that you could easily take over the city if you wanted to . You scared them so much that they 'll let me be killed . They 'll actually risk trouble with Mars just to kill you . " " I 'm sorry about you . I mean it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear-splitting explosion hurled him to the carpet , deafened and blinded him . He recovered and saw Gerri a few feet away , dazed , groping on hands and knees . Lane jumped to the window , looked quickly , sprang back . Cybrain pumped orders to his nervous system . " Blaster cannon , " he said . " But just one . Gotcha , cybrain . I can beat that . " He picked up the black box that generated his protective screen . Snapping it open with thumb-pressure , he turned a small dial . Then he waited . Again an enormous , brain-shattering concussion . Again Lane and Gerri were thrown to the floor . But this time there was a second explosion and a blinding flash from below . Lane laughed boyishly and ran to the window . " Look ! " he called to Gerri. * * * * * There was a huge gap in the crowd below . The pavement was blackened and shattered to rubble . In and around the open space sprawled dozens of tiny black figures , not moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen to throw their blaster beam right back at them . " " And they knew you might  --  and yet they let a crowd congregate ! " Gerri reeled away from the window , sick . Lane said , " I can do that a couple times more , but it burns out the force-globe . Then I 'm dead . " He heard the 3V newscaster 's amplified voice : "  --  approximately fifty killed . But Lane is through now . He has been able to outthink police with the help of his cybrain . Now police are feeding the problem to their giant analogue computer in the sub-basement of the Court House . The police analogue computer will be able to outthink Lane 's cybrain , will predict Lane 's moves in advance . Four more blaster cannon are coming down Broadway  --  " " Why do n't they clear those people out of the Square ? " Gerri cried . " What ? Oh , the Fans  --  nobody clears them out . " He paused . " I got one more chance to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed a small stud in the wrist . He said , " Trooper HQ , this is Lane . " A voice spoke in his helmet . " Lane , this is Trooper HQ . We figured you 'd call . " " Get me Colonel Klett . " Thirty seconds passed . Lane could hear the clank of caterpillar treads as the mobile blaster cannon rolled into Tammany Square . The voice of the commanding officer of the Troopers rasped into Lane 's ear : " Meat-head ! You broke out against my orders ! Now look at you ! " " I knew you did n't mean them orders , sir . " " If you get out of there alive , I 'll hang you for disobeying them ! " " Yes , sir . Sir , there 's a girl here  --  somebody important  --  from Mars . You know , the planet . Sir , she told me we could take over the city if we got loose . That right , sir ? " There was a pause . " Your girl from Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . If we had moved first , captured the city government , we might have done it . But they 're ready for us . They 'd chop us down with blaster cannon . " " Sir , I 'm asking for help . I know you 're on my side . " " I am , Lane . " The voice of Colonel Klett was lower . " I 'd never admit it if you had a chance of getting out of there alive . You 've had it , son . I 'd only lose more men trying to rescue you . When they feed the data into that analogue computer , you 're finished . " " Yes , sir . " " I 'm sorry , Lane . " " Yes , sir . Over and out . " Lane pressed the stud on his gauntlet again . He turned to Gerri . " You 're okay . I wish I could let you out . Old cybrain says I ca n't . Says if I drop the force-globe for a second , they 'll fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . " * * * * * Gerri stood with folded arms and looked at him . " Do what you have to do . As far as I can see , you 're the only person in this city that has even a little bit of right on his side . " Lane laughed . " Any of them purple-haired broads I know would be crazy scared . You 're different . " " When my grandparents landed on Mars , they found out that selfishness was a luxury . Martians ca n't afford it . " Lane frowned with the effort of thinking . " You said I had a little right on my side . That 's a good feeling . Nobody ever told me to feel that way about myself before . It 'll be better to die knowing that . " " I know , " she said . The amplified voice from below said , " The police analogue computer is now hooked directly to the controls of the blaster cannon battery . It will outguess Lane 's cybrain and check his moves ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about giving me a kiss before they get us ? Be nice if I kissed a girl like you just once in my life . " She smiled and walked forward . " You deserve it , Lane . " He kissed her and it filled him with longings for things he could n't name . Then he stepped back and shook his head . " It ai n't right you should get killed . If I take a dive out that window , they shoot at me , not in here . " " And kill you all the sooner . " " Better than getting burned up in this lousy little room . You also got right on your side . There 's too many damn Troopers and not enough good persons like you . Old cybrain says stay here , but I do n't guess I will . I 'm gon na pay you back for that kiss . " " But you 're safe in here ! " " Worry about yourself , not about me . " Lane picked up the force-bomb and handed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Then take your hand off , real fast . It 'll shut off the screen for a second . " He stepped up on to the window ledge . Automatically , the cybrain cut in his paragrav-paks . " So long , outa-towner . Now ! " He jumped . He was hurtling across the Square when the blaster cannons opened up . They were n't aimed at the window where the little red-white-and-green tricolor was flying . But they were n't aimed at Lane , either . They were shooting wild . Which way now ? Looks like I got a chance . Old cybrain says fly right for the cannons . He saw the Mayor 's balcony ahead . Go to hell , old cybrain . I 'm doing all right by myself . I come to see the Mayor , and I 'm gon na see him . Lane plunged forward . He heard the shouts of frightened men . He swooped over the balcony railing . A man was pointing a blaster pistol at him . There were five men on the balcony  --  emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand shot out , fingers vibrating . As he dropped to the balcony floor in battle-crouch , the men slumped around him . He had seen the man with the blaster pistol before . It was the Mayor of Newyork . Lane stood for a moment in the midst of the sprawled men , the shrieks of the crowd floating up to him . Then he raised his glove to his lips . He made contact with Manhattan Armory . " Colonel Klett , sir . You said if we captured the city government we might have a chance . Well , I captured the city government . What do we do with it now ? " * * * * * Lane was uncomfortable in his dress uniform . First there had been a ceremony in Tammany Square inaugurating Newyork 's new Military Protectorate , and honoring Trooper Lane . Now there was a formal dinner . Colonel Klett and Gerri Kin sat on either side of Lane . Klett said , " Call me an opportunist if you like , Miss Kin , my government will be stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lean , sharp-featured man with deep grooves in his face , and gray hair . Gerri shook her head . " Recognition for a new government takes time . I 'm going back to Mars , and I think they 'll send another ambassador next time . Nothing personal  --  I just do n't like it here . " Lane said , " I 'm going to Mars , too . " " Did she ask you to ? " demanded Klett . Lane shook his head . " She 's got too much class for me . But I like what she told me about Mars . It 's healthy , like . " Klett frowned . " If I thought there was a gram of talent involved in your capture of the Mayor , Lane , I 'd never release you from duty . But I know better . You beat that analogue computer by sheer stupidity  --  by disregarding your cybrain . " Lane said , " It was n't so stupid if it worked . " " That 's what bothers me . It calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of beating those big computers now , should anyone use them against us . " " I just did n't want her to be hurt . " " Exactly . The computer could outguess a machine , like your cybrain . But you introduced a totally unpredictable factor  --  human emotion . Which proves what I , as a military man , have always maintained  --  that the deadliest weapon in man 's arsenal is still , and will always be , the individual soldier . " " What you just said there , sir , " said Lane . " That 's why I 'm leaving Newyork . " " What do you mean ? " asked Colonel Klett . " I 'm tired of being a weapon , sir . I want to be a human being . " END * * * * * Work is the elimination of the traces of work .  --  Michelangelo
