Cattle breeders are in a fluster about dwarf calves , which are being born in ever-increasing numbers in the U.S. and Canada , and cattle experts are building up herds of dwarfs for study . Last week Professor E. W. Stringam of the University , of Manitoba was tenderly nursing a bull calf which he and assistants had delivered by Caesarean section from a dwarf cow . The calf , sired by a normal young bull , is normal in proportions . It will outweigh its mother in three months , but it probably carries the taint of hereditary dwarfism . <P> Geneticists believe that dwarfism is a classic example of Mendelian inheritance , and that it is caused by a single recessive gene . A bull may appear normal , but if it carries the gene of dwarfism and is mated to a carrier cow , one-quarter of their progeny will on the average be dwarfs , one-half will be carriers , and one-quarter will be dwarf-free . If the carrier bull is mated to a dwarf-free cow , no dwarfs will appear in the first generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Dwarfs into Sausage . Dwarfs mated to dwarfs produce all dwarfs , but although dwarfs are potentially fertile , they rarely reach breeding age . Many are born dead or die soon after birth . Those that live to maturity grow about half the size of normal beef cattle . They wheeze and stagger ; their bellies swell , and they often die of bloat . Dwarf beef is of poor quality . Most dwarfs that go to market are ground into sausage . <P> Cattle have always produced a few dwarfs , just as humans do . But stunted cattle were never common until about seven years ago , when they began to increase alarmingly in all three leading beef breeds-Shorthorn , Hereford and Aberdeen Angus . The increase has continued ever since . <P> Cattlemen prefer to say nothing about their dwarfs and get rid of them quietly . It hurts the value of a herd if too many little monsters are staggering around the range . So no one knows how many there are . Estimates of the proportion of dwarfs in beef breeds have gone as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the figures might be higher if cattlemen did not conceal their monsters . Considerably less than 12% of dwarfs can bankrupt a cattleman . <P> Bump on the Forehead . Cattle experts believe that the epidemic of dwarfism may be a result of breeding beef cattle for squat , spraddle-legged , " blocky " figures . This type wins prizes in shows and brings high prices at the stockyards , but animals selected for their blocky shape may be precisely the ones most likely to be carriers of dwarfism . The dwarfs are blocky too , and in other ways are caricatures of the beef-cattle ideal . An expensive , aristocratic bull may be the cause of a bad outbreak of dwarfism . <P> The only way to be sure that a bull is clean is to mate him to at least 15 carrier cows and see if his calves are ever dwarfs . This takes a long time , so the cattle experts are trying hard to find some other system . Dr. Paul Wallace Gregory of the University of California at Davis has invented a " profilometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bull 's forehead which shows that he may be a carrier . Sometimes X rays are used to look for the " crumpled " vertebrae that carriers sometimes have . Chief obstacle to cleaning the herds of carriers is the cattle fanciers ' love of low-slung critters likely to carry the sinister gene .
