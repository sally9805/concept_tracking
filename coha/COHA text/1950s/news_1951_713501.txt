txt Letters to The Times British Opinion in Crisis  --   - -  Jew Statesman . and Nation Defended , People 's Attitude on Peace Given CO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A controversy between Englishmen in an American newspaper over the merits of an English journal may strike most of your readers as a quaint manifestation of our national humor . Nevertheless , J. H. C. Morris ' letter in your issue of Jan. 4 deserves a rejoinder , since he seeks to discredit The New Statesman and Nation , and with t the body of British opinion , whose view of American policy ranges from anxiety to hostility . While it is true that many of The New Statesman 's readers disagree with much of its editorial opinion most of the time , we doubt whether it has ever in recent years commanded such a wide measure of support and sympathy as it does today . Its leading editorial of last Nov. 25 , headed " Lord Salisbury and the Left Wing , " praises the stand taken by the Conservative leader in the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for saying that an effort should be made to reach a settlement on the two immediate issues which threaten war " ( i. e. , German rearmament and relations with Communist China ) . Combined Opinion It then notes that a group of twenty-nine left-wing M. P. 's had tabled two resolutions , the first of which was in broad agreement with Lord ' Salisbury . Such a combination of opinion does not seem to indicate " a narrow group of so-called intellectuals . " As your correspondent showed at the time , the reaction to the news of the President 's reported announcement on the use of the atom bomb was rapid and widespread ? in France , incidentally , as well as in Britain . Both among politicians and acute students of European history the proposal to rearm Western Germany has met with consistent and trenchant opposition . We are faced , in Western Europe , with a dilemma : if we are forced into ruining our economies by an unbearable program of rearmament , we shall be creating just those conditions of misery and tension in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that The New Statesman holds by any means a narrow or ill-informed view in asserting that the only longterm way to combat communism is by raising standards ? an end to which American vision and resources have nobly and , in Western Europe , successfully contributed . Emigre comment on affairs at home must always be received with reserve , but in general we think that the British people have very little sense of enmity for the Chinese , . and practically no sympathy with Chiang Kaishek . Also there is good reason to wish that the American public could be made more sharply aware of the extent of Western European dissent from American policy in Formosa and in the refusal to recognize Mao in the United Nations  --  the latter of which leaves China virtually unrepresented in a world council acting immediately on Far Eastern affairs . Peoples ' Anxieties These opinions are not confined to an isolated intellectual Left : they spring from the anxieties of people whose long experience in the give-and-take of politics and diplomacy suggests to them that in a situation of extreme danger , precipitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to understand the other point of view may still help to preserve the basis of peace . There is , it seems to us , a growing danger that any attempt to reach a negotiated settlement , or rather a tolerable modus vivendi , may come to be denounced to the American people by means of a loose and historically illinformed use 9f the word " appeasement , " and thus be frustrated . Such an attempt need not break up the military , economic and democratic strength of the Atlantic community . For us the alternative may prove to be annihilation , which , whether alone or with the best of allies , is a discouraging prospect . J. R. POLE , GERALD E.

Eliminating Charge for Transfers To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : After having run the annoying gamut of 6-cent , 7-cent and 8-cent fares , the new 10-cent fare has at long last freed both the bus drivers and the riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling of pennies . This helpful step therefore gives rise to the question of whether the bus companies could not now afford to eliminate the charge of two ? cents for transfers and to liberalize the use of transfers between the red bus and the green bus lines . It seems strange that the city , when granting the latest increase in fares , did not insist upon the two aforementioned points . ALBERT L. WECHSLER . New York , Jan. 3 , 1951 . Plan for the Long Island Working With War Prisoners To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A short time ago I returned from a meeting of former prisoners of war which I had organized in Germany for men who had been in captivity in Britain and for . Britons Who had been in German prisoner-of-war camps . For the last three years of my service in the British Army I had been in charge of the political re-education of prisoners . It was gratifying to be able to give spiritual and moral support to thousands of men , and to help Europeanize Germans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to their homeland as true Europeans who were keen to work for New Terminal Suggested in Queens to Lower Costs of Operation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Perhaps a solution of most of the Long Island Rail Road 's troubles can be found if the one essential change can be secured : relief from the high cost of operating into the present New York terminal . For some years past the possibility of such a change by construction of a new terminal , without immense cost , has existed . By far the greater proportion of the road 's passengers use one of the subways between the road 's terminal at Penn ' Station and their daily destinations . Therefore , any point which can be reached easily by all three subway divisions  --  IRT , BMT and INDwould serve for a Long Island Rail Road terminal . Such a point happens to exist , and at a peculiarly advantageous place : at Queens Plaza , in Queens . This is advantageous because the Long Island Rail Road owns a large area directly adjacent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthermore , is occupied only by railroad yards . A single-story station , constructed over the Sunnyside yards , with passages connecting to the subways , would be a reasonably economical piece of construction . It need not be a showy marble-fronted building with ornament , nor need it even be too elaborate within . In fact , both the concourse-waitingroom section and the train shed could well be built of actual Quonset units without the least disadvantage . Removal of the Long Island terminal to this locality might well not only rid the road of the costs now charged for Penn Station facilities but might well make service more convenient for a very good portion of the commuters . Certainly the Pennsylvania Railroad 's own steadily growing volume of business might well be benefited by having the trackage now used for Long Island purposes in that station available . The plain fact is that Pennsylvania Railroad traffic alone today exceeds in volume , the total for which . Penn Station was planned back around 1905 . Thus , removal of the Long Island Rail Road from that station may indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . In fact , insufficient platforms to care for Pennsylvania Railroad incoming trains in rush hours or on heavytraffic , holiday-end periods already result in conspicuous delays . Competing forms of transportation , such as buses and airlines , have already taken advantage of this to eat into the passenger revenue of this railroad . STEPHEN G : RICH . Verona , N. J. , Jan. 6 , 1951 . Civic Courtesy To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A seemingly trifling incident may be a comment on officialdom and have a. bearing on the reform movement in civic administration . The other day my taxi driver went slightly over the stop line . The traffic officer waved him back to permit the pedestrians to cross the avenue . My driver dutifully obeyed . The policeman said " Thank you . " When the light turned red my cab leaped forward and bumped into the rear of a car across the street which had not yet started . " Take it easy , " I said . My driver apologized . He was sorry but he forgot what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 've been driving a hack for twenty-one years , and : this is the first time I ever heard a cop say ' thank you . ' " HOWARD DIETZ . New York , Jan 10 , 1951 . Defense of America Only To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Let us make America strong and still stronger . Let us raise a powerful army , and give it the best equipment ; and so defend America against any aggressor ; but let us not send our boys to fight against the Red hordes in Europe or China . In this I completely agree with Hera bert Hoover . JULIUS LOBENSTEIN . New York , Jan. 6 , 1950. international understanding . It is my opinion that former war prisoners , having experienced'the horrors of war and having spent years behind barbed wire , may be the best envoys for peace and understanding . I intend to organize an international prisoner-of-war meeting next summer . I hope to see many former prisoners from the United States , England and France join my German friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are far more than is generally assumed , HERBERT SULZBACH .
