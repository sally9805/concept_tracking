Beset by absenteeism , inadequate production and hard drinking among Poland 's low-paid workers , the Communist regime of Wladyslaw Gomulka first tried friendly persuasion . When that failed , the government last month fired 2,500 miners who had played hooky once too often . As an added penalty , it forbade the men to work again in the mines , where the pay , while not enough to live on , is nevertheless almost double the average of employees in other state industries . The regime proudly claimed last week that as a result of its action , production in the mines immediately went up and absenteeism down ( from 23% to 16% ) . But many of the workers should be able to find construction jobs in the newly encouraged private industry sector , which frequently pays better wages .
