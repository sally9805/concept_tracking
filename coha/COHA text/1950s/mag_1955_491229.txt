FOR more than a year we have been working at the direction of the United States Senate on the most comprehensive investigation ever made into juvenile delinquency in America . Never before has it been possible to make such a thorough and far-reaching inquiry into the cause and effect of youthful wrongdoing in this country . Never before has it been possible to piece together such a complete picture of what is hap  --  pening ? both good and bad ? to a distressingly large segment of our school-age population . As members of the staff of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency , we have crisscrossed the United States repeatedly since November of 1953 to study conditions thathave caused an amazing increase of 45 per cent in law infractions by youngsters in t he last live years . We have conducted investigations in cities and small towns from Boston to Los Angeles , from Denver to the District of Columbia , from New York to San Francisco and from Chicago to El Paso . We have been aided by countless slate and local officials wor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into conflict with authority last year . We have been aided by many experts in the field who predict that the total will mount , to more than 2,000,000 annually by 1960 unless drastic action is taken . We have been aided by school officials whose pupils have committed offenses ranging from win-dow breaking to rape and murder . We have been aided by businessmen who see the nation 's crime bill anoint ing by millions of dollars a year because of increasing juvenile delinquency ; by housewives who have been terrified by the growth of neighbor  --  hood gangs ; by union officials who have seen buses and trolley cars wrecked and their drivers gravely injured by teen-age hoodlums . In all , the subcom  --  mittee , composed of Chairman Robert C. Hendrick  --  son , Sen. William Langer , Sen. Estes Kefauver and Sen. Thomas C. Heimings , Jr. , has heard some .500 witnesses and recorded millions of words of testi  --  mony . It has seen at first hand what is and what is not being done about juvenile de ! inquency , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criickpot I henries in order to trod common  --  sense solutions to the problem . The subcommittee 's job of breaking through the false but widely held belief that there is one main cause for juvenile delinquency and one pet solution for the problem was not easy . Our part of the job be  --  gan in Washington one bleak September day in 1953 when the two of us  --  with a combined experience in the field of juvenile delinquency of twenty-two years ? met in a Washington office near Capitol Hill to begin planning the investigation that had been authorized by the Senate . We faced each other across a desk piled wit Ii hundreds of letters that had already come in from all parts of the country , offer  --  ing advice on how to get the real low-down on juvenile delinquency . Just glancing through a few of the letters suggested the difficulties and complexities of our problem , and pointed up some of the unreal  --  istic attitudes that have become part of our national thinking . The way to end juvenile delinquency , " one writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cents , thus making farmers more prosperous and attracting people from t he wicked cities to t he peace  --  ful countryside . " Another correspondent suggested : " End juvenile delinquency by outlawing daylight-saving time , which keeps children out late . " These examples may seem ludicrous , but you can take our word for it t hat juvenile delinquency is a subject on which people have a multitude of fixed ideas that are based on only a fragmentary under  --  standing of the problem . Plowing through the let  --  ters  --  and there were thousands more of them in the following weeks  --  we were impressed with the num  --  ber of persons who might have stepped out of 1 he fable of the blind men who vainly tried to describe an elephant after one had touched only its trunk and another had touched only its ear , and a third had clasped the animal 's treelike leg . Most people had formed their theory of juvenile delinquency out of their own personal knowledge of a single specific ease , but had failed to realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eliminate the slums , " another letter said , " and you will eliminate juvenile delinquency . " We found , in the course of our investigation over the next sixteen months , that the slums do contrib  --  ute a disproportionate number of delinquents , but the writer of the letter overlooked the fact that millions of good Americans began life in the slums and that thousands of delinquents come from good Next Week homes , good neighborhoods and good families . Testimony before the subcommittee , for instance , showed that in Oklahoma City several hundred high-school children were regularly going on jags by using barbiturates purchased illegally from a drug  --  gist . Groups of teen-agers rented apartments , put in a supply of barbiturates and then staged a " goof-ball " party . Police who broke in on one such party found scantily clad boys and girls who were " high " on goof balls . In the subsequent investigation , it was shown that none of the children involved came from " the wrong side of the railroad tracks . " Incidentally , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee , copied the antics of grownups by pleading the Fifth Amendment . The next letter was brief : " Why are you wasting the taxpayers ' money ? The majority of kids in this country are good , decent Americans and the prob  --  lem is being sensationalized by the press . " During the investigation we found instances where some newspapers made a youthful crime wave out of scattered delinquent acts . But we also en  --  countered literally hundreds of public officials who minimized the problem of juvenile delinquency to cover up their own shortcomings . Pointing their lingers at law-abiding children , they proudly called attention to the fact that more than 90 per cent of the nation 's youth do not get into serious trouble . Such dissembling in the face of the present increase in delinquency is as dangerous and culpable as the public-health official who would say : " Do n't worry about polio  --  less than one per cent of our children catch it . " " The real reason for delinquency , " said another letter , with a Kansas postmark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod and spoiling the child . " Sure . But what about the case of Florence , who lived in a small Iowa town . ( Her name has been changed , as have those of other involved young  --  sters , for this report . ) An attractive , auburn-haired girl of sixteen , she was the eldest of three daughters of a minister who was in comfortable financial cir  --  cumstances . Florence 's father always made it clear that he expected her to be a model of circumspection and if she failed to live up to her father 's ideas she was severely disciplined , even for minor infractions . She was n't permitted to attend dances even when they were sponsored by the high school . She was for  --  bidden to wear lipstick . When she tried to act like the other girls at school , the punishment was stern and she often spent many resentful hours in her room . Florence could take such treatment just so long . When we found her , she was in a state training school for girls . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ran away from home , got involved with several men and learned about beer joints and narcotic peddlers . Extremely heavy use of the rod not only failed to keep Florence on the straight and narrow path but obviously had driven her away from it . Pick up another letter : " What we need is to atop mollycoddling the hoodlums , to get the cop back on the beat and to treat ' em rough . " But in Cleveland we came across the record of bow police toughness possibly boomeranged . Some years ago police in the Ohio city caught a group of boys who had been pilfering from stores for some weeks . The arresting police , according to the boys , treated them none too gently and one slum-bred ten  --  year-old was slapped and pushed around severely be  --  fore being taken to the detention center . It was his first encounter with authority and he was both frightened and resentful . Later , he sullenly told his probation officer that one day he 'd get even with the cops . Thereafter , his hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few years he was in all of the local courts and public agencies , the training schools and the state reformatory . Not long after his release from the reformatory police surprised him in a store robbery and called on him to surrender . His reaction was automatic . " I hate cops ! " he yelled , and opened fire , fatally wounding a policeman . Other letters advised us that all that children need is love and affection . Delinquency , they main taMed , resulted from neglect and rejection . Certainly we found that rejection causes delinquency in many children , but overindulgence is just as bad . Take a look , for instance , at what happened to an Indian  --  apolis boy who seemed to have everything in his favor . Bill was n't mean or wild . On the contrary , he was a good-looking , fair-haired Norwegian boy who did well in school and had a pleasing personality . He lived with his mother in one of the better apartment houses near the downtown area . At twelve he was high spirited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school authorities , but he was no cause for real concern . Later , with several other boys , he occasionally went for a joy ride in an auto  --  mobile that had been parked with the key in the lock . When the boys were finally caught on such a ride , Bill 's mother rushed to the rescue , paid for a damaged fender and persuaded the owner of the car to forget the incident . When Bill got into trouble at school and was threatened with suspension , his mother intervened with a friend on the school hoard and the charges were dropped . When he was later caught breaking into a neighborhood store , mother hired the best lawyer in town and the rase was n't prosecuted . But when Bill was sixteen he was again caught joy riding in a stranger 's automobile , and the police decided they had had enough . Mother 's high-powered law  --  yers swarmed around , but Bill was taken into juve  --  nile court and ordered to the Indiana Boys ' School at Plainfield for an indefinite period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother agreed that it was time her son faced the realities of life , and she promised to co-operate with the school authorities in his rehabilitation . She did ? for three months ? and in that period Bill settled down to work with good prospects of success . But after three months , mother could stay away no longer . She hired more lawyers . She appealed to state officials . Finally , she visited BW . " I 'm going to get you out of here , " she assured him . " This time we are going to take it right up to the governor and you 'll be out next week . " As a result of that promise , Bill 's progress at the school ended abruptly . When three weeks had passed with no sign that he would he released . Bill ran away . A few days later he stole an automobile and drove it into Ohio , where he was arrested . The boy who started out with everything in his favor except an overindulgent mother ended up in the Indiana Reformatory at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This letter is next in the pile and it comes from the judge of a juvenile court : " Everybody knows that in my county we have established a model juvenile-court system . It is true that delinquency has increased in our county , but it is obvious that the cause must be found in the breakdown in family life . " The juvenile-court system is a big advance over the old criminal-court handling of children . But in most counties of the nation we found that . the pro  --  bation services necessary to the system were corn ? pletely lacking or spread too thin to do the job  --  as illustrated by the fact that today there are only 7000 probation officers . in the United States instead of the 40,000 who are needed . The tragedy  --  as well as the long-run cost  --  of this shortage was well dem  --  onstrated by the case of a girl named Mary who grew up in a small town in North Carolina without much parental control . Mary 's parents were divorced when she was small , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supported the girl and her mother . Mary did n't like her home , however , and developed a fondness for staying out late at night . When she was only twelve years old her mother complained to the police and finally petit ioned the juvenile court to de  --  clare the girl incorrigible . The well-trained but over  --  worked probation officer wrote several letters to both the mother and the daughter asking them to come to her office for interviews , but there was no response . Upon further investigation , the officer was told that Mary had been sent to another county to live with relatives on a farm . The case was then dropped . But a couple of years later the mother again peti  --  tioned the court to have Mary declared incorrigible . The girl was brought into court and put on proba  --  tion , with instructions to report once a week to the probation officer . Mary took the order well . She was n't communicative , but she was polite , and usually reported on the assigned day for a talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had a good excuse . ( Continued no Page 77 ) THE SHAME OF AMERICA Went ' 1 from Page 19 ) The probation officer , who did n't have time to leave her own office and did n't have any investigators to send for a checkup , was sat Wier ' I hat Mary was making good progress . The girl said she had a job and was getting along well . She looked better , she had better clothes and seemed to he more cheerful . For almost a year , the officer regarded Mary se a model probat inner  --  unt it t he girl 's mot her complained again . This time the probation officer had to tear herself away from a heavily overloaded desk and do some field work that should have been undertaken months earlier . Mary had moved away from her mother 's home and estab  --  lished herself in a rooming house , where the officer found her . " You 've violated probation and will have to come with me , Mary , " I he offi  --  cer told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to pack , but one of Mary 's possessions was a handsome photograph album . The officer opened it and discovered that it was filled with nude photographs of Mary , who promptly admitted that her " job " for months had been posing for obscene photographs . " I want to get in the movies , " she added , " and this guy told me a lot of actresses started in the movies by posing for nude pictures . I saw some of the pictures in magazines , WO , so I decided to do the same . " When the photographer was arrested , it developed that a number of juveniles had posed for him in similar fashion . But for Mary there was no repentance . For almost four years she had been in serious conflict with her parents and with the authorities , and neither had been of any help to her when she needed it most . At sixteen , she was a stubborn , uncommunicative girl with a pimply face and mousy brown hair  --  a dull shadow of the heavily rouged photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy from the authorities and she still intended to get into the movies . The judge committed her to an institu  --  tion for delinquent girls where the e tax- payers , who could n't afford to hire enough probation officers , now pay $1200 a year for Mary 's care . " Boys will be boys ... " another let  --  ter began . " Kids are doing nothing more than we did when we were young , but they go to court for it now . " Relatively innocent pranks do bring some youngsters into the courts , but juvenile offenses today also involve serious and vicious acts . We found ex  --  perts across the nation mystified and frightened by a pattern of wanton bru  --  tality by juveniles who seem to act without reason and without provoca  --  tion . This phenomenon occurs in widely scattered cities , in contradiction to all past experience of law-enforcement of  --  ficers , who usually know how to handle youths who rob or rape , but have no way of guarding against those who just beat up anybody they happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys  --  often from good family back  --  grounds  --  completely terrorized several neighborhoods by roaming the streets at night and attacking almost any youth they chanced to meet . They had no apparent motive and they had no in  --  terest in fair play . They always made sure that the odds were three or four to one in their favor and instead of using their fists they attacked with garrison belts , which have unusually heavy metal buckles that gravely injured several victims . In New York two boys killed a man they had never seen before , and with whom they had no quarrel , by knock  --  ing him down , kicking him and finally juimung on his head . Their explana  --  tion of this senseless act was that they had been drinking beer . In Chevy Chase , Maryland , a group of boys from well-to-do families secretly monufec  --  tared bombs and tossed them through windows of homes as they wandered along the streets at night . In San Fran  --  cisco six boys crashed a party at the home of a high-school girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's father so severely that he was hospital  --  ized . We discovered during our investiga  --  tion that school systems generally were almost totally unprepared to recognize or cope with the early symptoms of juvenile delinquency and that all too often overburdened teachers aggra  --  vated rather than ameliorated the trend toward waywardness . Henry , a tow  --  headed , fourteen-year-old boy , came from a hard-working family in a small Midwestern town . There were four children in the family , none of them troublemakers . But Henry had diffi  --  culty learning to read when he went to school . Nobody ever found out why Henry was slow in reading ? he was bright enough otherwise  --  because no  --  body ever tried to find out . Instead of getting at the cause of his trouble , the hard-worked teacher gave him a seat in the back of the schoolroom and more or less by-passed him as a means of get  --  ting around the immediate prohlem . Being unable to read much , Henry naturally could n't keep up with the class in any subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the teacher finally gave him a special job assisting the janitor . By then Henry had become a misfit . He withdrew from other chil  --  dren . School was a painful experience because everybody regarded him as be  --  ing dumb . He began to play hooky . He ganged up with some other truants , in  --  cluding several real troublemakers . They roamed the streets late at night and eventually were caught breaking into a neighborhood grocery store . Already known to the court as a tru  --  ant . Henry was commit ted as a delin  --  quent for an indefinite period to a state training school . There , for the first time , somebody took an interest in finding out why he could n't make nor  --  mal progress in reading . The problem was not difficult  --  in-co-ordination of the eyes ? but it was discovered too late . Henry 's bitter public-school ex  --  perience had left him with such a re  --  sistance to learning that he was well beyond help . We found that youngsters who were rejected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Western town of 20,000 there was a short , stocky boy with a shock of red  --  dish hair and an easy grin that lit up his homely face . His mother provided a decent home for him , and Billy might have grown up to be a stalwart citizen except for the fact that everybody in town knew his father had been a gam  --  bler and embezzler who was fatally shot white trying to escape from the state prison . The neighbors looked at Billy and shook their heads and clucked and predicted confidently that he would come to no good end . Billy was n't yet in his teens when he became fully aware of the town 's opin  --  ion , and by the time he was in the fifth grade he seemed to he convinced that he had to prove the town was right . He fought with other students and rebelled against the teacher 's He ran away from home three times .

It is shocking to find ? as the subcommittee riiii li nil ? t hat a similar Prot Pet iiiii racket was tie  --  ing run by teen-age delinquenta in I he schools of such cities as Philadelphia . Los Angeles and Washington , D.C. The school-ground protect ion racket proved to be extremely simple and ii might have been directly inspired by any number of stories of glingsl era that children read in the newspapers or see enacted in the movies or on television . The young racketeer sometimes had his own mob of toughs , Ind frequently he was merely bigger and more hard-boiled than his schoolmates , most of whom admired his daring . In any event , he picked out the boys who had ready pocket money and offered not to heat them up or to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  lar sums , varying from a dime to a dol  --  lar . At first glance , this seems a fairly simple problem to deal with , but in practice it has proved exceedingly diffi  --  cult to wipe out  --  even in the beat of schools . In Washington , D.C. , for example , there is a junior high school in one of the better neighborhoods with about 1300 pupils . In the autumn of 1953 one of these pupils was a fourteen-year-old boy named Eddie , who was large for his age , who was a poor student and who was known to the principal because he had been transferred from the Dis  --  trict of Columbia Industrial Home School . Eddie was the product of a broken home , He hated his father , who had beaten him , and he had been in  --  volved in petty thefts and burglary . His mother tried to help him , but he often wandered away and police once found him sleeping in an automobile parked on the street . The principal at the junior high school kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lunch with the older boys and to spend his spare time doing odd jobs in the school office . Eddie 's teachers liked and trusted him , even after he had told one of them , " I 've got a had reputation and I 'm going to live up to it . " The boy 's mother had financial prob  --  lems and could n't give him much spend  --  ing money . There were , however , plenty of boys at the school who had liheral allowances from their parents . Eddie began approaching them with sug  --  gestions that they ought to divvy up . Since he was hig and tough , these sug  --  gestions bore fruit in a number of cases and , if there was resistance , iI usually collapsed when several of Eddie 's ad  --  mirers  --  there were many of them among boys from good families ? gathered around and offered to heat the brains out of the guy who was trying to pick a quarrel with their pal , Eddie . By the end of October , Eddie , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appear regularly late at night at neighborhood beer joints or snack bars and sometimes to hang around a nearby restaurant where there was an orchestra and where , ac  --  cording to complaints to police , some juveniles had secured marijuana ciga  --  rettes . Nobody ever found out just how much Eddie was collecting each week , but it is certain that his victims  --  later said to number thirty or forty  --  were too frightened to complain to the au  --  thorities until early in November . Then un nnonymoue note Caine to the princi  --  pal saying that Eddie was forcingstu  --  dents to pay protection money to him . The principal culled Eddie in and asked him /demi the note , but the boy vigorously denied the charge . " I bet I hat ' s from a fellow I had a fight wit h , " he added . " The guy said he was going to try In gel even with me . " There was n't much the principal could do except deliver a stern lecture and try to keep a closer watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such mild measures creak up his racket . On the contrary , he began expanding open , ' ions . ( hi November seventh , he demanded money from a boy named Fred , who handed over his pocket change after being threatened . On the morning of November tenth , Eddie stopped another boy ( Harry ; and de  --  manded payment of a dollar . Harry was n't much surprised , because by that lime quite a few of the students knew about Eddie 's racket . " I have n't got a dollar , " Harry stalled . " You want your face knocked in ? " Eddie threatened . " You can get a dol  --  lar , and you better get it quick . You meet me on the corner when school is out at three o'clock , and if you do n't have that dollar you 'll be sorry . " Adults reading about such childish threats may find it difficult to see why any boy would pay up instead of going to the authorities . But when you are fourteen or fifteen years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some other boy , the situa  --  tion is much different . You have to go to school every day and you never know when a gang may rough you up . You have to travel the streets at night or take your girl to the MOVieS , .. und you never know what 's going In happen to you at . I he next dark corner . The effec  --  tiveness of Eddie 's I hreals was demon  --  strated by the silence of his victims un  --  til November tenth . That . morning Fred 's father called the principal and said that Eddie had forced his son to hand over his pocket money . A little later Harry showed up at , the princi  --  pal 's office as the first of the victims with courage enough to defy the gang . The principal called the police . Two detectives came to the school and talked to Harry . One of them gave him a dollar bill , the serial nu rn her of which had been recorded , and told him to keep his date with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desig  --  nated corner and Harry handed over the money , with the detectives watch  --  ing from a distance . Then they arrested Eddie , searched him and recovered the bill as evidence . In his pocket was a knife with a long stiletto-type blade . The arrest of Eddie should have put an end to the story , but it is significant in studying the juvenile viewpoint to note that it did not . Most of Eddie 's school friends were boys from good families . They knew about Eddie'a racketeering , but they regarded Harry , not Eddie , se the villain of the piece , The following Saturday night Harry and two other boys took their dates to a dance at the Silver Spring Armory , in nearby Maryland . The dance ended about midnight , and some forty-five minutes later the six youngsters slopped their automobile at a drive-in restau  --  rant for sandwiches before going home . Two other boys were in another car al  --  ready parked at the restaurant , and one of them promptly pointed at Harry . ? ' There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry and his friends did n't wait for their sandwiches , but drove away at once them off the road . This attempt failed , but it soon hecarne apparent that two other cars also were following Harry and his friends . The boy who was driving lived nearby . He aped into his own street and stopped at his own front door with the idea of getting the girls into the house . The pursuing cars , however , were too close . They screeched to a stop and nine boys leaped out and ran across the yard to intercept Harry . Fighting started immediately , the girls ran screaming to the house and the police were summoned . By the time the police arrived the attackers had escaped in their automo  --  biles , but they had had plenty of time to do the job . Harry was taken to the hospital with severe cuts and bruises and an injured hack . One of his com  --  panions was beaten so badly he re- ( mired surgery and suffered a fractured jaw . The third hoy had been knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was severely bruised . All of the assailants were eventually identified and taken into custody . Every one of them was from a good family background . Several of them did n't even know Eddie , but had joined in the chase when they were urged to help beat up a squealer . When the nine were later placed on probation , Eddie showed no signs of satisfaction , hut re  --  marked bitterly that he supposed he twoe " would to take the rap for all of h The cases of Eddie and others that we have outlined here suggest only a few of the many problems that must be faced in any thorough investigation of why there has been a sharp increase in juvenile delinquency in the United States . In this series of reports on our work with the Senate Subcommittee , we will show in detail how these prob  --  lems and others are being handled or mishandled by our courts , by our offi  --  cial agencies , by our police and others .
