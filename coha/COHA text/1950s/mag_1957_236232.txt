Rising during the House debate last week on the $1.6 billion military construction bill , Illinois Republican Leslie Arends wrinkled his long nose at the scent of one particular section . What he objected to was some finicky fine print giving Congress veto power over Defense Department efforts to get out of such nonmilitary ventures as operating ice-cream plants , laundries , dry-cleaning plants , etc . <P> The section could be interpreted , said Les Arends , as " a political provision whereby members of Congress can stop the Secretary of Defense from closing commercial activity in their districts . Much is said here on the floor about the size of the federal budget , and we have been seeking ways to cut the cost of Government . By terminating or curtailing Government business-type activities that rightfully belong to private enterprise , we can reduce Government costs . And yet it is proposed by this section to retard and obstruct such a program . " <P> Impressed , House members , sitting as the committee of the whole , struck out the section . Soon after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who proposed the provision in the first place rallied votes , stuck it back in again by a 230-to-183 , party-line vote . Unless the Senate amends or the President vetoes , the Defense Department will keep on making paint , roasting coffee and laundering skivvies in addition to more important duties until Congress grants permission to quit . <P> Also in Congress last week : <P> The House , reversing an earlier decision , agreed to a Senate provision keeping the soil-bank program alive for one more year ( see BUSINESS ) . Under a compromise in the $3.6 billion Agriculture Department appropriation bill $500 million is allowed for the soil bank , but payments to individual farmers ( now unlimited ) are scaled to a maximum of $3,000 . <P> The House Commerce Committee , 15-13 , approved a natural-gas bill modified from the measure vetoed last session by President Eisenhower to retain some direct federal controls on natural gas produced for interstate distribution . Though the House is expected to pass the bill this session , the Senate will probably duck it until next year . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program containing the Administration 's request for authority to barter U.S. farm surpluses to Iron Curtain nations in return for strategic materials . The bill also allows the Administration to complete the second half of a $95 million agreement that provides for loans to Poland and payment in Polish currency for U.S. farm surpluses .
