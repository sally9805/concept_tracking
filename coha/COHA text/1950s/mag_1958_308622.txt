He wrote to House Speaker Sam Rayburn outlining the first firm steps he wants to take in returning to the 48 states some functions now handled by the Federal Government - along with the revenue sources to pay for them. * <P> His offer : in return for giving up $100 million worth of federal grants-in-aid they now get for vocational-education work and water-purification plants , the states should get the chance to collect $150 million of the revenue that the U.S. now takes in from its 10% tax on local telephone calls . <P> Aware that some G.O.P. Governors are among the reluctant - specifically those whose states happen to be among the net losers in such a swap - Eisenhower sent a message to the Governors ' Conference in Miami Beach . " If a healthy functioning of all our political parts is to be maintained , " he wrote , just about every citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in Washington . <P> <P> * Since World War II , the total tax take of state and local governments has risen 3 times as fast as the federal take .
