txt ENGINEER IN WRECK DENIES EXCEEDING AUTHORIZED SPEED Testifies Train Was Down to ' 25 Miles an Hour at Time of Woodbridge Crash FOUND NO WARNING LIGHT Fitzsimmons Says He Was Alert for Signal , Could Have Stopped in 1,000 Feet The engineer of the Pennsylvania Railroad train that was wrecked Tuesday evening with the loss of eighty-three lives told investigators yesterday that he had been traveling at authorized train speed and had seen no yellow , warning light as he approached ' , the slow zone in Woodbridge , N. J. Joseph H. Fitzsimmons , the engineer , told his story from his bed in Perth Amboy General Hospital , where he is recovering from injuries . The gaunt-looking and unshaven engineer was questioned by Commissioner William J. Patterson of the Interstate Commerce Commission , John E. Boswell , president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities Commissioners , and other investigators . As the official investigations moved into their third day , the engineer 's account resolved some inconsistencies in his earlier statements about train speeds of fifty and twenty-five miles an hour at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trestle over I a new highway . Air Brakes Found in Order Questioned by Mr. Patterson , Mr. Fitzsimmons said he had received slow orders covering the Woodbridge area at Bayhead Junction last Tuesday morning . He added that before he pulled train 733 , the Broker , out of Jersey City , his air brakes had been inspected and found in good working order . Asked what his speed was prior to entering Woodbridge , he said : " I was going at the authorized speed of sixty miles an hour . I was in a little fog , but the signals were all clear . " I was going to shut off at Edgar , which is a station just west of Woodbridge , and get to the restricted speed . I threw the throttle at sixty . " Asked if he had then applied his air brakes , he explained that " throwing the throttle " produced an automatic speed reduction from sixty to fifty miles an hour . This was his speed , he said , as he reached the Woodbridge station . " Then the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1,000 feet at that reduced speed , because I had more than that to go , " he continued . " When the crash came , I ca n't say exactly the speed , but I judged I was down to twenty-five miles an hour . " Says Speed Dropped Quickly Mr. Fitzsimmons said that when irs first reduced train speed he used eight to ten pounds of air pressure to bring the train down to fifty miles an hour . He said he could feel the air brakes " bite , " , and that the train reduced speed quickly when it was about 1,200 , feet from the trestle . Asked what had happened next , he declared : " The engine seemed to slip out from beneath me . It seemed to be pulling me . " All the time , I was looking for a yellow light , a yellow light , a yellow light . That is the custom . " At this point his voice broke and he asked.for a glass of water . Regaining composure , he continued : " One light is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the slow order is effective . Those lights were not there . The railroad at that point curves to the left , and , in the new territory , rapidly curves to the right . " Adelbert S. Schroeder , assistant general counsel for the railroad , , asked him : " Is n't it a fact that on the P. R. R. it is the practice not to have yellow lights ? " " Maybe , " the engineer replied , " but on the New York &; Long Branch Railroad we always have them . " Mr. Boswell took up this point and asked : " What is your experience on yellow lights ? " " Whenever a restriction is placed on part of a run , " the engineer answered , " they have a yellow light there . I was looking for them . I did n't see them . I do n't say they should have been there , but I was looking for them . " " Are you familiar with the New York &; Long Branch practice on // yellow lights ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them , " the engine-driver replied . " How about the Pennsylvania Railroad practice ? " the I. C. C. official inquired . " They do not put up lights , " Mr. Fitzsimmons said . " They notify you by general order . " The engineer testified that he had the Pennsylvania 's instructions with him , and that railroad operating rules were generally standard so far as he knew . Mr. Boswell then produced a book of rules of the Pennsylvania Railroad dated 1948 and read the following from Page 24 : " A yellow flag or light at the right of the tracks indicates an approach to an area covered by a slow order . The end of the area is indicated by green flags or lights . " " Do you know that rule ? " Mr. Boswell asked . " Yes , that 's the light I was looking for , " the engineer replied . No Mechanical Failure Shown The third day of investigation failed to disclose any evidence of mechanical failure in the elevencar commuter train that was derailed at 5:45 P. M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Woodbridge trestle came to light . Investigators still struggled to established the exact point where the derailment occurred , and to determine whether the coal tender ( A. one of the train 's eleven passenger cars went off the rails first . Railroad witnesses produced by Mr. Schroeder in the New Yorker Hotel yesterday afternoon said that the tender apparently had left the tracks at a point one carlength east of the Woodbridge trestle . The tender held 10,000 gallons of water and 20,000 pounds of coal when the wreck occurred . William P. Bickley , Pennsylvania master Mechanic , told the joint inquiry that six trains and two locomotives had passed over the trestle safely last Tuesday afternoon . Robert K. Swords , railroad foreman at South Amboy , said the marks on tracks and ties indicated that the tender had derailed " approximately one car-length east of the bridge . " Question Conductor Today At 2 o'clock this afternoon the joint inquiry will visit Point Pleasant Hospital in New Jersey to question John Bishop , conductor of the train . Deputy State Attorney General Benjamin C. Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to join this session . Mr. Van Tine , who had disagreed with Mr. Patterson 's conduct of the inquiry last Friday , declined yesterday to furnish to the joint inquiry statements taken from railroad officials and employes . The New Jersey official said his office had joined the investigation in the belief that it could develop additional testimony by cross-examination of witnesses . On that understanding , he said , he had been willing to give the transcripts of testimony to the inquiry . Since he had been checked by Mr. Patterson , he said , he would now make the statements available to New Jersey authorities for their own inquiry . Mr. Patterson said he had no objection to Mr. Van Tine 's partici- , pation in the hearings or his crossexamination of witnesses , if the questioning was confined to testimony brought out on direct exam-1 ination . He added that Mr. Van , Tine could call his own witnesses at any time . The joint inquiry commission will resume the Manhattan end of its investigation at 10 A. M.

All railroad trestles and bridges in New Jersey will be inspected by the Board of Public Utility Commissioners as a result of Tuesday 's wreck .
