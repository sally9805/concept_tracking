Their eyes glued to the skies , the monitors at the U.S. missile-tracking stations in the South Atlantic searched the darkness one night last week . Suddenly they gaped ; far above , starbright and hell-hot , a thing-it looked like a meteor-plummeted through the stars of the heavens and then disappeared over the horizon . Hours later in Washington , U.S. spacemen announced the news : Big Joe , the funnel-shaped prototype of the vehicle that will carry the first U.S. man into space in 1961 , had been shot aloft in a test and had been recovered intact . Had a man been inside for the historic flight , he would have made his return in complete safety . <P> Chief testing point for Big Joe was its ability to keep a passenger alive . From the moment that it was hurled from its Cape Canaveral pad by an Atlas-D , the capsule 's recording system went to work . Ten microphones registered the take-off noise-120-130 decibels ( plenty loud , but not unmanageable for well-protected ears ) . Temperature readings recorded interior and exterior heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed 100 miles above the earth , malfunctioning booster engines in the Atlas kept the bird from reaching out to its planned distance ; after thundering about 1,500 miles downrange-just a few hundred miles short of the target-the capsule began its fiery . 15,000-m.p.h. re-entry into the earth 's atmosphere . <P> At that instant , Big Joe 's two radio transmitters predictably blacked out under an electrical blanket of ionized air . But a recorder inside kept taping instrument signals until the one-ton capsule recovered its voice , then began transmitting all the data that it had collected in no man 's land . Slowing down to 700 m.p.h. in the atmosphere . Big Joe popped a parachute when it reached 50,000 ft. , then another at 10,000 ft . It sizzled into the ocean at a gentle 20 m.p.h. , 20 min. after takeoff , still beeping its signals . Homing planes quickly zeroed in on Big Joe 's position , radioed the nearest destroyer , and within 8 hr. the recovery ship hove to , plucked the capsule out of the sea . <P> Remarkably , Big Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most crucial moments , never exceeded 100 , a factor not lost on the seven U.S. astronauts , one of whom will one day ride into the heavens in another Big Joe .
