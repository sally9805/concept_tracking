Tito &; Co . <P> <P> Sir : <P> From all the sparkling gems you distribute so generously week after week in your publication , the column " Dear Comrade " June 6 is the Kohinoor ! The Voice of America should broadcast it-not one time , but again and again , in all languages , so that people all over the world know what the Bulganins and the Khrushchevs and the Molotovs and all the other Kremlinitwits and Moscowards had to say about " Dear Comrade " Tito before they went to Canossa ! <P> FRANZ TRAUGOTT <P> Providence <P> Sir : <P> I was disappointed to note a tinge of snobbery in your recent article on Marshal Tito . I believe that his rise from the son of a poor peasant to the Communist President of Yugoslavia is a story in many ways paralleling the traditional American Horatio Alger legend . . . I , therefore , rue the day when we look down upon a man for being , not a Communist dictator , but " The Peasant 's Son . " <P> <P> EDWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir : <P> G.A.W. June 13-next ? G.A.P . ( guaranteed annual profit for businesses ) ? G.A.I. ( guaranteed annual income for professional persons and farmers ) ? G.A.C. ( guaranteed annual commissions for salesmen ) ? What about day laborers and migratory workers ? Why not a G.W.F.M. ( guaranteed weekly filet mignon ) for all of us ? <P> F. INISTORE GODFREY Baltimore <P> Elephants , Anyone ? <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . At the present time I 'm working for civil service up in Alaska . I 'm an ex-coast guardsman . . . only 22 years old . . . <P> My contract is up in September . . . All I want to do is get home the cheapest way possible . I live in Delano , Calif . I thought that if I could buy an elephant and ride it home , I could sell it at above or the same cost I paid for it . If you would tell me where I could buy one and the cost , I would appreciate it . . . <P> <P> JIMMIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <P> Sir : These doctors and educators et al . who so promptly damn politicians for the unfortunate difficulties in the path of the Salk vaccine distribution June 13 should be reminded of the one sure way to get rid of our politicians-establish a dictatorship.That will do the trick-if they want to pay the price . <P> <P> LAMBERT FAIRCHILD New York City <P> Opinion &; Desegregation <P> Sir : <P> I protest ! To call our nation 's highest court an " inept fraternity of politicians and professors " is mockery beyond forgiveness June 13 . Agreement or disagreement with a decision from the court is no basis for such a smear as printed by the Richmond News Leader . Those who criticize so noble a tribunal behind the cloak of a free press are not worthy of the freedom they possess . Clear-thinking Americans can not help respect the determination of the U.S. Supreme Court to keep America the " land of the free . " <P> HOWARD D. MOORE Independence , Mo . <P> <P> Criminal &; Moral Codes ( Contd . ) <P> Sir : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 issue : . . . To make criminal any sexual activity in which husband and wife engage with mutual consent and love is . . . ridiculous . What married people do in bed is no more the business of lawmakers than is the way they cook their eggs when they get up ...
