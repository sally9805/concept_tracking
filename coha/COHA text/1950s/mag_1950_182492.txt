Kidnapping , C.O.D . <P> A U.S. court-martial in Salzburg last week convicted an American corporal and a sergeant of kidnaping . Corporal Paul Abel got 20 years and Sergeant John Frankey got 15 years after they confessed that they had taken $653 from the Russians to abduct a gardener named Oswald Eder , a double spy who served both the Russians and the Allies ( TIME , Feb. 20 ) . <P> The investigation of the Eder case uncovered more guilt than Abel 's and Fran-key 's . Their battalion , the 796th Military Police , has 600 men . More than 100 knew about the kidnaping ; 20 of them had been approached by those who wanted Eder kidnaped . None reported the proposition or the kidnaping to U.S. authorities . The 796th has many black-marketeers , some , called the " three-to-two boys , " who lend money on a basis of $300 returned for every $200 advanced . Three-quarters of the MPs in the battalion are under 21 , and most of them have been subject to the corrupting influence of military occupation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
