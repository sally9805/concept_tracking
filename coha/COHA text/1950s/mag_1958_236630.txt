When the question of reform of the House of Lords came up for debate four months ago , no aspect of it shocked the peers more than the proposal to admit women to the august Upper House . " The main point is that many of us do not want women in this House ! " roared the 83-year-old Earl of Glasgow . " We do not want to sit beside them on these benches . We do not want to meet them in the library . This is a House of men , a House of Lords . We do not wish it to become a House of Lords and Ladies . " More gallantly , the Earl of Home suggested that " taking women into parliamentary embrace would seem to be only a modest extension of the normal functions and privileges of a peer . " <P> Heedless of some of the Lords ' qualms , the government pushed ahead with its plan to modernize the Upper House with legislation that shattered the traditional hereditary principle by providing lifetime peerages for both men and women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gibes and merriment , deplored any attempt at reforming the House of Lords on the ground that it should be abolished entirely . Anthony Wedgwood Benn , young ( 33 ) Laborite heir of Lord Stansgate , has long been trying to divest himself of an inheritance that will blight his political career by forcing him to leave the House of Commons . As his father listened in the gallery , he pointed out that the title descends to " heirs male of his body lawfully begotten , " complained : " I am the victim of my father 's virtue . " <P> Irrepressible Nye Bevan concluded for the opposition . Noting that one impassioned Tory defender of heredity had cited Bevan 's own respect for the " science of breeding " in raising pigs on his Buckinghamshire farm , Nye gleefully commented : " I must say that I thought that was an inelegant metaphor . I should never have thought of using it myself . I am not quite certain what the test is to be . In pig breeding , it is length and leanness . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought to have the members of another place the Commons ' phrase for the House of Lords paraded before us , so that we can examine them . . . " <P> The Tory majority was not to be deterred , and the House of Commons approved , 305-251 , the bill 's crucial second reading . By midsummer the House of Lords should have its first ladies-and its first lords-for-life-only.
