txt President Eisenhower 's request for continuation of the excess profits , tax until Dec. 31 was approved today by the Senate Finance Committee . Quick Senate passage was forecast . The committee accepted without change The House bill to extend the 82 per cent corporation levy for six months , retroactive to June 30 , . when it expired . The enactment of the measure would produce an estimated $800 , - 000,000 of revenue and hold the Federal deficit in the present fiscal year to about $5,600,000,000 . Coupled with planned expenditure reductions , according to Administration spokesmen , this would lay the ground for a balanced budget in the new fiscal year , which starts next July 1 . Senator Eugene D. Millikin , Republican of Colorado and chairman of the Finance Committee , said that he " would n't be surprised " if the Senate passed the bill by the end of this week . Small Business Aid Backed The bipartisan managers of the bill , Senators Millikin and Walter F. George , Democrat of Georgia , staved off amendments in the committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate floor . Their task was not eased by a report from one Republican Congressional leader attending today 's weekly White House conference that President Eisenhower would be willing to accept an amendment designed to ease the impact of the tax on small businesses . The President was said to have emphasized , however , that he would take such a position only if the bill 's managers believed that the one change would not open the measure to a flood of amendments . It is on the widely held theory that it would be impossible to limit amendments , once the first had been adopted , that key Senators have been working for passage of the bill without any change . The adoption of a single amendment , it is held , could lead to so many others that Congress would wind up with a bill reducing revenues rather than increasing them . Any change at all would require sending the measure back to the House of Representatives , possibly resulting in new delays in a joint conference . Senate passage without change would send the measure to the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a number of amendments , but voted on only one , Senator Millikin said . It rejected , by what he called a " comfortable " margin , a proposal by Senator John 3 . Wil- Hams , Republican of Delaware , to exempt corporations with annual earnings of less than $100,000 . The present exemption is $25,000 . In other quarters the vote was reported as 9 to 6 . ? The bill was approved by a voice vote . The Williams proposal was similar to one accepted and later abandoned by House leaders in the form of a bill by Representative Antoni N. Sadlak , Republican of Connecticut . Administration spokesmen said at the time of the House fight that it was acceptable as a compromise . Under the Sadlak bill , some corporations would have been eligible for the exemption for the entire 1953 year . This would have reduced the revenue of the proposed extension by an estimated $60,000,000 . Senator Williams proposed to limit the benefits to the last six months of the year , cutting the loss to about $32,000,000 . He said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Millikin expressed the belief , however , that the bill would be passed without change . Senator William F. Knowland of California , acting Majority Leader , announced that the measure , would be taken up tomorrow onl Thursday . It will have right-ofway over practically all other legislation , he said . With the adjournment drive now on in earnest . Mr. Knowland put Senators on notice to expect night sessions for the rest of the week . He also scheduled a Saturday meeting . Need of Revenue Stressed In its formal report on the excess profits tax extension bill , the Finance Committee said that while it believed the levy to be " inequitable , it is of the opinion that the size of the deficit makes it necessary to continue the tax for another six months . " Moreover , the report added , enI actment of the measure " will I remove the complaint that the existing law terminates the excess profits tax six months ahead of any individual income tax reduction . " The committee dispensed with public hearings and reported the bill out after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colin F. Stam , head of the Congressional staff of tax experts , gave the members the arguments for and against the proposal , Mr. Millikin said . Among the amendments considered without formally being proposed , he reported , was one to fix Oct. 1 as the expiration date of the excess profits tax and of the 1951 increase of about 11 per cent in most individual income taxes . The income tax rise ends automatically Dec. 31.
