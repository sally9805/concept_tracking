ATOMIC ENERGY Power Play For the first time , the Atomic Energy Commission opened public hearings last week on whether to approve construction of a nuclear power plant . Technically , AEC was to decide if a privately financed 100,000-kw. reactor being built at Monroe , Mich , will endanger the lives and health of more than 2,500,000 residents of nearby Detroit and Toledo . But proponents of public power , spearheaded by United Automobile Workers President Walter Reuther , wanted to turn the hearings into a decisive round in the running battle over whether nuclear-generated electricity is to be pioneered by the Government or by U.S. industry . On the ground that the plant was too risky , they wanted AEC to halt the project , move it to a remote test area . AEC then would probably take over , giving the Government a big lead in developing one of the most promising power reactors now under construction . <P> Promise &; Doubt . Target of the Reuther forces was the Power Reactor Development Co. , a combine of Detroit Edison Co. , 17 other private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate the $45.5 million Monroe plant under the leadership of Detroit Edison President Walker Lee Cisler . P.R.D.C. is building the first commercial " fast-breeder " reactor , the type most likely to produce competitively cheap atom power , since it produces more atom fuel than it consumes . Late in 1955 , the first experimental fast breeder ran out of control at the National Reactor Testing Station , melted its own fuel with more than 1,130 C. of heat , and contaminated the reactor with radioactivity for six months . <P> Opponents of P.R.D.C. 's fast breeder got one good arguing point when AEC 's Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards warned last June : " There is insufficient information available to give assurance that the reactor can be operated at Monroe without public hazard . " But AEC disagreed , gave P.R.D.C. a " provisional permit " to build last August , did not publish its advisory committee 's warning until October . The decision was immediately criticized by Senator Clinton P. Anderson , who is joint Congressional atomic energy chief and a public-power enthusiast . Then the U.A.W. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Paperworkers of America , got AEC to retreat a bit , order P.R.D.C. to prove publicly that its fast breeder was safe . <P> Fact &; Fission . P.R.D.C. did much to dispel these fears last week by submitting the testimony of five top-drawer atom scientists and reactor experts . Their verdict , summarized by Professor Hans A. Bethe of Cornell University : " By the application of theoretical physics to what we now know , a fast-breeder reactor can be constructed and operated without undue risk to the public ... its operation is safe . " Furthermore , AEC stressed that its Monroe permit is only for the construction of the plant , not its operation . Unless all the bugs are worked out of the fast breeder by the time the plant is finished in 1960 , it will not be loaded with nuclear fuel .
