When Phillip was born in the West Texas town of Kermit ( pop . 7,000 ) , doctors soon saw that nature had made a series of deadly mistakes . Milk could not reach the baby 's stomach , because his gullet came to a dead end in the upper chest . He had no anal opening ( the lower colon wound itself into another dead end ) . Furthermore , both kidneys were on the right side , and one did not work . Surgeons at nearby Odessa made a temporary opening into Phillip 's stomach so he could be fed , and another opening in the lower bowel for evacuation . But the sickly infant , in constant danger of death from pneumonia or choking in his own saliva , was still an insupportable burden to his father ( a low-paid oilfield worker ) and his mother who had four other youngsters to care for . <P> During one of Phillip 's hospital sieges in Galveston , Mrs. Steven Culpepper. an Abilene housewife with one son of her own , heard of his plight and undertook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for permanent correction of Phillip 's physical defects . For almost two years , no hospital would risk it because of court fights over Phillip 's custody . But armed at last with full adoption papers affirmed by the state Supreme Court , Mrs. Culpepper took her adopted boy to Texas Children 's Hospital in Houston . There , during the summer , surgeons removed the nonfunctioning " left " kidney from Phillip Culpepper 's right side . <P> And there , late last month , surgeons finished the job of correcting nature 's errors . They freed Phillip 's windpipe from a useless connection with his stomach , made a continuous passage from mouth , through throat and gullet , to stomach . After intravenous feeding during convalescence ( and almost three years of being fed liquids through a tube ) , Phillip Culpepper demanded an egg . Last week he got it-fried , " over easy . " Far from wealthy ( her husband is a journeyman plumber ) , Mrs. Culpepper had gambled $1,000 in legal expenses and $2,000 in medical bills to give the boy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided we 'd rather have him than anything else . " she explained , " so we just sacrificed . " The sight of a healthy-looking Phillip ( he will be three on Dec. 28 ) , eating an egg and almost ready to go home , was their payoff.
