In a mountain cave near Subiaco , Italy , a tall , white-haired Englishman with gentle eyes stood in silent prayer . The place was Sacro Speco , where , tradition says , St. Benedict spent years as an anchorite . The Englishman was Historian Arnold Joseph Toynbee , and ( aloofly in the third person ) he now describes what he felt there three years ago : " Here was the primal germ of Western Christendom ; and , as the pilgrim read . . . the names of all the lands , stretching away to the ends of the Earth , that had been evangelized by a spiritual impetus issuing from this hallowed spot , he prayed that the spirit which had once created a Western Christian Civilization out of the chaos of the Dark Age might return ... " <P> In various forms , that prayer reappears throughout all of Toynbee 's writings . In an era when most historians , of what Toynbee himself has called the **33;4872;TOOLONG school , saw religion either as a block to progress or else considered it beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spiritual end . He reached the conclusion that man 's real history is religieus history and that civilizations are really nothing but steppingstones in man 's progress to deeper spiritual insight . Yet Toynbee , an Anglican in childhood , always showed himself so ready to range various prophets , gods and philosophers alongside Christ that the question inevitably arose just what kind of Christian he was . That question is more fully answered in his new book , An Historian 's Approach to Religion ( Oxford ; $5 ) , in which he writes about the religious condition of today 's world . <P> Toynbee makes the point that historians share with Christians the sin of selfcenteredness-a result of spiritual pride . He considers it an intellectual as well as a moral error , " because no living creature has a right to act as if it were the center of the Universe . " <P> The Chasm . Measuring man 's religions with this rule , Toynbee finds the modern world riven by a gulf even deeper and wider than that between the Communist and non-Communist worlds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideologies and religions " on the one hand and the " Buddhaic group " ( Hinduism , the Mahayana and Hinayana forms of Buddhism ) on the other . For the East , like ancient Greece , sees history as cyclical , recurrent , and hence irrelevant , while Christianity , Judaism and Islam see it governed by Intellect and Will , i.e. , God . But in assigning history this divine importance , they " have reopened the door to self-centeredness by casting themselves , in rivalry with one another and ignoring the rest of Mankind , for the privileged role of being God 's ' Chosen People .
