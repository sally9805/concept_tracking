txt  | terns , showing more clearly the effects of climate . If there is such a thing as a general pattern of animal distribution , the fresh-water fishes ought to show it perhaps better than any other animals , and they do in fact show broad patterns which are well defined and very informative . There is not space in this book to discuss all the classes of vertebrates as thoroughly as I should like , and I have therefore chosen to treat the fishes in somewhat more detail than any others , because they illustrate general patterns and principles so well . The main system of classification of fishes used here , down to and including the orders , is Romer 's ( 1945 ) . Berg 's ( 1947 ) classification has been referred to also in some cases . The families were originally taken from Regan ( 1929 ) because of the importance of his geographical work on fishes , but a good many changes and additions have been made . These classifications differ in details , but the differences are not very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . Many strictly marine groups are not even mentioned here , and many fossil groups of unknown habits or unknown geographical significance are omitted , so that the classification of fishes at the end of this chapter is much abridged in places . The reader who is not familiar with fishes should consult Romer 's text ( 1945 ) to learn the main features of fish evolution and classification . For zoogeographical purposes fresh-water fishes may be grouped in several different ways . Cyclostomes and shark-like fishes are relatively unimportant in fresh water . The important fresh-water groups are all bony fishes , and of these it is useful sometimes to contrast the non-teleosts ( archaic bony fishes ) with the teleosts ( higher bony fishes ) , and at other times to contrast the single dominant fresh-water order Ostariophysi with all other orders , lumped as non-ostariophysans . These groupings are designed to match primitive against derivative forms and non-dominant against dominant ones and to reveal their different patterns of distribution . The groups are compared in Table  | 1 , and their content is given in more detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this chapter . Fishes occur in almost all fresh waters , even in the most adverse climates and on the most remote islands . All the fishes that occur in fresh water are fresh-water fishes in a sense , but their zoogeographic significance varies with their salt tolerance and behavior . This is obvious and has long been understood in a general way , and various attempts have been made to classify fresh-water fishes according to their relation to the sea ( e.g. , Boulenger 1905 , pp. 414 ? 415 ) and to account for some details of their distribution by passage of salttolerant forms through the sea ( e.g. , Regan 1912 , in his discussion of fishes and Wallace 's Line ) , but Myers ( 1938 ) made possible a real advance in understanding of fish geography by proposing an ecological classification of fresh-water fishes based simply on their ability or inability to tolerate salt water . Fishes that are strictly confined to fresh water Myers put in a primary division . Those that live chiefly in fresh water but have a little ( not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And fishes that occur in fresh water but have much salt tolerance may be put in a peripheral division ; this term is not from Myers but from Nichols ( 1928 , pp. 6 ? 7 ) . This brief preliminary statement of Myers ' arrangement does not do it justice . The three divisions are very complex groups , which cut across taxonomic lines and which must be discussed before they can be understood and defined more accurately . The primary division , of strictly fresh-water fishes , contains only bony fishes . The primitive , non-teleost groups that belong here are the African polypterids , the Chinese and North American paddlefishes , the North American bowfin , and the Australian and AfricanSouth American lungfishes . Of teleosts , there are many , of diverse origin , some or the other of them occurring on every habitable continent except perhaps Australia , where there is only one ( doubtfully ) primary-division teleost , an osteoglossid . In North America the primary-division teleosts are the mooneyes , many Ostariophysi ( see below ) , the pikes and mud minnows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centrarchid basses and sunfishes , and the true perches including the darters . A complete list of primary-division families is included in the taxonomic list of fish families at the end of this chapter .  | About seven-eighths of all the primary-division fresh-water fishes of the world belong to one order , Ostariophysi . This order is distinguished by a chain of " Weberian ossicles " connecting the air bladder with the inner ear . The chain is thought to carry vibrations to the inner ear and to increase the sensitivity of hearing , and it is thought that ability to hear well may be especially useful under fresh-water conditions ( Regan 1922 , p. 204 ) , and may account at least in part for the unique success of the Ostariophysi in fresh water . It is a curious and important fact that , although ostariophysans dominate most fresh waters , there are very few of them in the sea . Out of nearly 40 families and 5000 species of them , only 2 families , the ariid and plotosid catfishes , with not over 150 species , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the Ostariophysi belong the hordes of characins , gymnotid eels , carps , minnows , loaches , suckers , and catfishes , some or the other of which swarm in the fresh waters of every continent except Australia ( paraphrased from Myers 1938 , p. 345 ) . The secondary division , fishes usually confined to fresh water though a few enter the sea , contains only bony fishes , and not many even of them : of primitive non-teleosts , only the North and Central American gar pikes ; and of teleosts , only the cyprinodonts and cichlids . These groups all live chiefly in fresh water . However , gar pikes enter the sea along the Gulf of Mexico coast . Many cyprinodonts do not seem to be much inconvenienced by salt water . One of them , a Mollienisia , enters the sea freely and multiplies in brine pools about Manila Bay , where it was accidentally introduced ; a Rivulus has been reported from tide pools on Curacao ; and some Fundulus and Cyprinodon live permanently in sea water along coasts beyond the reach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mid-Atlantic pelagic haul . The cyprinodont genus Aplochcilus is presumed to have unusual salt tolerance because of its occurrence on islands , in the Orient , beyond the reach of most fresh-water fishes . Of cichlids , most can survive several hours or days in the sea , and one species ( a Tilapia ) , collected in brackish water in Mozambique , survived for months in sea water at the New York aquarium . It is evident that many species of the secondary division might survive short sea journeys , and their distributions show that some of them have done so . ( Much of the preceding part of this paragraph is from Myers 1934 , p. 345 . ) Besides these , parts of some other families now placed in the primary division may have to he transferred to the secondary division when their salt tolerances are better known . This may be true even  | of a few Ostariophysi , especially of certain cyprinids and catfishes which will be mentioned again . The peripheral division , of very salt-tolerant fresh-water fishes , and of fishes that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of forms of which only a few can be mentioned here . They include one family of cyclostomes and a few shark-like fishes , one family ( the north-temperate sturgeons ) of nonteleost bony fishes , and an almost endless diversity of teleosts . Even a few Ostariophysi belong here , the ariid and plotosid catfishes , which are chiefly marine but some of which enter or have become resident in fresh water , especially in isolated places . The habits of peripheral fishes are diverse . Many are migratory . Of these , some ( lampreys , sturgeons , salmon , and trout , etc. ) breed in fresh water but spend much of their lives in the sea , except that some species and genera of each of the groups named have become permanently resident in fresh water . Others ( anguillid eels , galaxiids , some gobies , etc. ) breed in the sea but spend much of their lives in fresh water , and among these , too , certain forms ( of galaxiids and gobies but not of anguillids ) have become resident in fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salt water for purposes other than breeding ; and still others , for example some sticklebacks , appear to live indifferently in both . Migratory fishes can be classified in complex ways according to their behavior ( Myers 1949 ) , and the details are important in studies of fish biology , but they are much less important in zoogeography . One of the advantages of Myers ' arrangement of fresh-water fishes in a primary and a secondary division is that the zoogeographically less important complications of their life histories are set aside and emphasis is placed simply on the extent to which the fishes can tolerate salt water and may have dispersed through it . Besides the migratory and indifferent forms there are many fishes living in fresh water which have obviously been derived locally from migratory or fully marine ancestors . Fishes of this sort occur in fresh water in all parts of the world but are most conspicuous in remote places such as Australia , where they make up the main part of the fresh-water fish fauna , and on remote islands . Examples in North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and the related whitefishes and graylings ) that now live entirely in fresh water ; the " White Bass " and " Yellow Bass " ( sea bass family ) , Freshwater Sheepshead ( marine drum family ) , and Burbot ( codfish family ) ;  | and certain cottids and atherinids . Further details will be found in the formal list of families of fresh-water fishes . Finally , a very large number of marine fishes of many different families run up rivers or enter fresh water occasionally or locally . This happens in every part of the world , and examples will be found scattered through almost any good faunal work on fresh-water fishes . A good series of examples is shown by the family Atherinidae ( see list of fish families ) . All fishes known to occur in both fresh and salt water in North and Middle America are listed by Gunter ( 1942 ) , and his list gives an idea of the diversity of behavior of these fishes . Other papers bearing on the subject are by Breder ( 1934 ) and Myers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional references . The whole subject of the relation of peripheral fishes to fresh and salt waters is much too complex to discuss further here . The important thing is that all the diverse fishes of the peripheral division either can pass through the sea or are probably derived rather recently from fishes that could do so , so that their present distributions are likely to be partly the result of dispersal through the sea . This arrangement of fresh-water fishes in three divisions according to salt tolerance is simple in theory but very complicated in fact and open to endless argument about details . The salt tolerances of many fishes are unknown , and it is and probably always will be impossible to draw sharp lines between the divisions . For the present most fishes are grouped by families , on the assumption that all the members of one family probably have about the same salt tolerance . This may often be true , but it is not always so . Many species even of primary-division families can tolerate brackish water , and a few can enter the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families of catfishes that are actually marine , various characins , carps , suckers , and fresh-water catfishes enter brackish estuaries ( Myers 1938 , p. 344 , footnote 4 ; and other sources ) ; a Japanese carp ( cyprinid ) which is widely distributed in rivers is frequently taken also in the sea ( Jordan 1905 , Vol. 1 , p. 256 ; Okada 1955 , p. 93 ) ; a small British Columbian cyprinid sometimes occurs in the sea and has reached Vancouver and Nelson Islands , which the strictly fresh-water cyprinids of the same region have not done ( Carl and Clemens 1948 , p. 77 ) ; and some species of the Oriental genus Mystus ( or Macrones ) of the fresh-water catfish family Bagridae live in the lower parts of tidal rivers and enter or live partly in salt water ( Weber and Beaufort 1911-1951 , Vol. 2 , p. 345 ; H. M. Smith 1945 ) . Still other species of primary-division families are distributed in such  | a way as to suggest that they may have crossed narrow ocean barriers to the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . As to the salt tolerances of ancient fishes , paleontologists and physiologists agree that the common ancestor of all fishes probably lived in fresh waters : the earliest fossil fish-like vertebrates are in freshwater deposits ( Romer 1945 , pp. 44-45 ) , and all fishes possess kidneys of a sort that probably originated in fresh water ( H. W. Smith 1932 ) . Sharks and rays and their allies of the class Chondrichthyes probably originated in the sea , from an ancestor which had left the freshwater environment . They have been ocean dwellers since the beginning of their known history ( Romer 1945 , p. 60 ) , and their flesh is impregnated with urea , apparently as an adaptation to life in salt water ( H. W. Smith 1932 ) . Several persons have transferred marine sharks and rays from sea water to dilute salt water or fresh water with the " inevitable " result that the animals absorbed water , swelled up , and died , apparently because they could not make physiological adjustments rapidly enough ( H. W. Smith 1932 , p. 15 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two species of Carcharias ( a primarily marine genus of sharks ) are believed to live only in fresh water , one in Lake Nicaragua , the other in the Zambezi ( Regan 1929 ) ; sawfishes habitually ascend tropical rivers from the sea ; some stingrays enter fresh water and others have become resident there ( Garman 1913 , pp. 415 ? 427 ) ; and there are some other records of selachians occurring or living in fresh water . These facts show that a very lung history of existence in one kind of water does not necessarily destroy the tolerance of fishes to other waters . The facts suggest , too , that the results of experiments made with a few species of fishes may be misleading . Laboratory experiments apparently do not always show the real tolerances in nature of even the species experimented with . The results of such experiments should not be applied too sweepingly to whole orders or families or to their ancient ancestors . The earliest bony fishes probably inhabited fresh water ( Romer 1945 , p. 75 ) . Polypterids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their origin , although at least a side line of lungfishes made a short-lived invasion of the sea in the Devonian ( Schaeffer 1952 , p. 101 ) . However , the ancestors of most existing fresh-water fishes have probably at some time passed through the sea . Teleosts may have originated in the sea ( Romer 1945 , p. 104 ) . If so , some of them returned to fresh water , and one , perhaps  | derived from a marine herring of the order Isospondyli , developed an improved hearing apparatus and evolved and diversified in the fresh waters of the great continents to form the order Ostariophysi . Certain ostariophysan catfishes then re-entered the sea . And finally some of the marine catfishes went back into fresh water in such remote places as Australia and Madagascar . If this history is correct , the endemic catfishes in Australian rivers are at the end of a line of teleost evolution which began in fresh water , went into the sea , back to fresh water , into the sea , and back to fresh water again . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freshwater fishes is a heterogeneous assemblage of unrelated orders and families . A few species of even the greatest fresh-water groups can enter the sea , and the tolerances and habits of many species , especially in the tropics , are unknown . The ancestry of most primary-division fishes is not such as to suggest that they have always lived in fresh water . On the contrary , many of them , including the Ostariophysi , were probably derived from marine fishes long ago . That the fishes of the primary division are and long have been confined to fresh water is proved less by their nature and evolutionary history than by their distribution , which will be described . This should be remembered . Certain striking features of their distribution help to prove that these fishes are confined to fresh water , and when an occasional species is found which breaks out of the usual distribution pattern , as for example the Australian osteoglossid does , an immediate possibility is that it is not really a strictly fresh-water fish . Myers ( 1949a , p. 317 ) mentions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indeed somewhat artificial , there are probably no sharp lines between them , and there is plenty of doubt about details . But the divisions are based on a real and very important fact , that fresh-water fishes vary in their ability to pass through salt water and that their distributions show it . It seems to me that these divisions , or others like them , are absolutely necessary to a real understanding of fresh-water fish geography . For practical purposes , and in the light of the preceding discussion , Myers ' divisions may be slightly redefined as follows . The primary division consists of families or other groups of fresh-water fishes that ordinarily can not or do not enter the sea ( although exceptional species of some of the groups do so ) and that have probably been confined to fresh water so long that their present distributions are the result of dispersal through fresh water , even though their remote ancestors may have lived in the sea . The secondary division consists of families  | or other groups of fishes that occur chiefly in fresh water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limited time , or are recently descended from forms that could do so , so that their present distributions may be and apparently often are partly the result of dispersal along coast lines or across narrow ocean gaps . The peripheral division consists of families or other groups that , although found in fresh water , are somehow closely connected with the sea or have been so recently derived from it that their present distributions may be and often are largely the result of dispersal through the sea . These divisions are designed for the study of distribution of freshwater fishes over the whole world . Other classifications may be more useful for local studies in some cases , for some groups of fishes that are certainly peripheral so far as the whole world is concerned may be confined to fresh water in certain places . This is true of some northern salmonids which , though derived from migratory forms , are now confined to local fresh waters and show the histories of drainage systems . Another example may be found in the Atherinidae . This family as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that it reached Australia through the sea . A number of Australian atherinid genera , however , forming the subfamily Melanotaeniinae , may now be strictly confined to fresh water and may be limited in the direction of the Solomons and Moluccas by old saltwater barriers , as if the Melonotaeniinae were primary-division fishes . This case is given as a hypothetical one , for there is some doubt about the fact of it ( see Atherinidae in list of fish families ) . The limits of distribution of fresh-water fishes are outlined in Figure 11 . Northward , a few primary-division fishes extend more or less widely above the Arctic Circle . Of non-ostariophysans , the Pike ( Esox lucius ) reaches all the main arctic river systems of Eurasia ( except western and northern Scandinavia ) , and parts of arctic Alaska , the Mackenzie delta , and the Anderson River , which is entirely above the Arctic Circle in western Canada . The Blackfish ( Dallia ) occurs in the central and western part of the " head " of Alaska north at least to the Seward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip of Asia ( the Chukotski region ) , and on St. Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea . It is the only primary-division fish specially adapted and limited to an arctic habitat . It lives in shallow water on the tundra , and is a small ( up to 8 inches ) , very fat fish , exceptionally  | able to withstand cold . Individuals kept apparently solidly frozen for weeks , then eaten by dogs and so thawed out , are sometimes vomited up alive ! That this fish , uniquely adapted to the tundra , is confined to such a small area , mostly south of the Arctic Circle , while the less specially adapted Pike and some other strictly fresh-water fishes are much more widely distributed in the arctic and go farther north , is a noteworthy fact . Two percids extend into the arctic in Eurasia , and the American Pike Perch reaches the Mackenzie delta . The Trout Perch ( Percopsidae ) crosses the Arctic Circle in western Canada . Of Ostariophysi , the Northern Sucker ( Catostomus catostomus ) extends above the Arctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyprinids extend into the arctic in Eurasia ; and at least one American cyprinid ( Couesius ) reaches the Mackenzie delta . ? Some of the fishes listed above reach true arctic environments , but others probably just follow large , north-flowing rivers , such as the Mackenzie in Canada and the Yenisei and Lena in Siberia , into the arctic but do not occur in the tundra country behind the main river banks . There are some arctic fresh-water habitats , notably stagnant ponds on the tundra , which are not inhabited by any primary-division fishes except ( within the limits of its small range ) by Dania , and there are areas of even the continental arctic where there are no primary-division fishes . There may be such areas in parts of northern Quebec and Labrador . The Pike , the Northern Sucker , and one cyprinid ( Couesius ) extend north in the Labrador Peninsula to 56 ? or 57 ? N. in the George River , but in some other parts of the peninsula no primary-division fishes are known . However , they are probably not barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get back to remote northeastern drainage systems from which they were eliminated by late Pleistocene ice . Peripheral fishes , especially salmonids and their allies , swarm in many arctic fresh waters both within and north of the limits of primary-division fishes , but even the peripheral forms decrease in variety in the farthest north . Berg ( 1950 , pp. 18 ? 19 ) says that , in Eurasia , a charr or trout ( Salvelinus , a genus of peripheral Salmonidae ) is the northernmost fresh-water fish , reaching Novaya Zemlya and the New Siberian Islands above Siberia . In America , the same genus extends still farther north , having been found in fresh water at least to 82 ? 34 ' N. on northern Ellesmere Island , near the final northern limit of land . These details of distribution of fresh-water fishes in the arctic are mostly from Berg ( various works ) and Wynne-Edwards ( 1952 ) .  | Southward , some groups of African primary-division fishes reach the tip of South Africa , but many others do not ( for details see p. 61 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably stopped more by habitat limitations than by coolness . Primary-division fishes are absent in most of Australia but not because of cold climate ; peripheral forms occur south through Tasmania and New Zealand . In South America , a catfish of the family Pygidiidae reaches 47 ? 30 ' S. , some 500 miles short of Cape Horn ( Eigenmann 1918 , p. 269 ) . It may be the most southern primary-division fish in the world , but peripheral fishes occur in fresh water probably as far south as there is any on South America and Tierra del Fuego . Within their northern and southern limits , faunas of true freshwater fishes , of the primary division , are confined to the continents , excepting Australia , and to certain continental islands . No fact in zoogeography is more striking than this , and it is this fact which proves that many groups of fishes have long been confined to fresh water . The geographical limits of continental fish faunas are shown on Figure 11 . These limits are passed by very few fishes indeed , except by such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried by man . Both North and South America are rich in fresh-water fishes , and a number of the South American groups reach the continental island of Trinidad , but not one fish of the primary division is native to the West Indies proper , although some salt-tolerant secondary-division and peripheral ones are ( Myers 1938 , pp. 356-357 ) . The northern island of Newfoundland , too , although a continental island lying close to the mainland , apparently lacks all primary-division fishes , although there are peripheral ones there ( Frost 1940 ) . True fresh-water fishes have probably been unable to reach this island since the Pleistocene . Africa has a great fauna of both ancient and modern families of fresh-water fishes , but not one fish of the primary division is native on Madagascar , although a few secondary-division forms and , of course , peripheral ones have reached the island . Europe and Asia have given one part or another of their primary division fish faunas to the continental British Isles ( Berg 1932 , and many other authors ) , Japan ( Mori 1936 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hainan ( Mori 1936 , pp. 47-51 ) , and Ceylon ( Day 1889 , Munro 1955 , and references in Hora 's papers ) , and most of the primary-division fish families of southeastern Asia extend to Sumatra , Java , and Borneo . Here , however , true fresh-water fishes stop abruptly ( Fig. 11 ) , as has long been known ( Regan 1912 ) . Some of them may stop short of the outer ends of Java ( Dammerman 1929 , pp.  | 15 ? 16 ) and North Borneo ; not much is known about this . The rich Oriental fish fauna is well represented on Java as a whole , but little of it reaches even the first of the Lesser Sunda Islands . Various ichthyologists from Regan ( 1912 ) to Beaufort ( 1951 , p. 180 ) have implied that a significant part of the Javan fish fauna reaches Bali , or at least that Bali has significantly more fresh-water fishes than Lombok . This is a mistake . The only primary-division fishes known and apparently native on Bali are two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both these genera occur also on Lombok , and Rasbora is on Sumbawa also . Fresh-water fishes do not mark Wallace 's Line at its southern end . Farther north , many Oriental primary-division fishes reach Borneo , but not one reaches Celebes , except as ( probably ) carried by man . A very few Bornean fishes reach the southern Philippines ( Herne 1928 ) . They are mostly small cyprinids , which occur through Balabac , Palawan , and the Calamian Islands to Mindoro , and through the Sulu Archipelago to and through the whole of Mindanao ( Fig. 11 ) . Several genera are involved , but especially Rasbora and Puntius ( Barbodes ) . There are endemic species localized along both the routes described , and in Lake Lanao on Mindanao there is a cyprinid fauna of at least four endemic genera and seventeen species , all apparently derived frojn one ancestor ( Herre 1933 ) . Besides the cyprinids , there is an ende inic genus and species of silurid catfish on Palawan and the Calamian Islands and an endemic species of clariid catfish on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native , primary division fishes of the Philippines . The only Oriental fishes ( excepting a genus of cichlids in Ceylon and peninsular India ) now placed in the secondary division are cyprinodonts . Of these , the genus Aplocheilus ( including Oryzias ) is notable for the islands it has reached . It is present on the Riu Kiu and Andaman Islands , where primary-division fishes are absent or very few ; it occurs on Lombok and Timor ; it has reached Celebes , where it has evolved endemic species ( Aurich 1935 ) and probably also the endemic family Adrianichthyidae ( see list of fish families ) ; and a species has been described from one locality on northern Luzon ( Herre and Ablan 1934 ) but , since cyprinodonts are unknown elsewhere in the Philippines , it may not be native there . In view of this distribution and of the known fact that many cyprinodonts are salt tolerant , there can be little doubt that Aplocheilus has dispersed partly through the sea .  | To return for a moment to the small cyprinids , two genera of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on islands beyond the limits of other primary-division fishes . Both genera cross Wallace 's Line on the Lesser Sundas , and both go most of the way up both routes of immigration of cyprinids into the Philippines . In fact one species , Puntius binotatus , which occurs in fresh water from Singapore through Sumatra , Java , and Borneo , has gone beyond the limits of most fresh-water fishes in all three directions , to Bali and Lombok , to Palawan , and to Mindanao , where it is the apparent ancestor of the endemic cyprinids of Lake Lanao . This pattern , like that of Aplocheilus but on a smaller scale , suggests that these cyprinids have more than usual salt tolerance , though not so much as Aplocheilus , and that they have been able to cross narrow ocean barriers . In the preceding discussion I have ignored certain primary-division fishes , particularly the labyrinth fishes Anabas testudineus and Ophicephalus striatus and the catfish Clarias batrachus , which are common food fishes , which live in a variety of fresh and brackish waters , which are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable periods if kept damp , and which are often carried about alive by man . These fishes occur beyond the limits of most freshwater fishes on the Lesser Sunda Islands , the Philippines , and Celebes , etc . They have probably been carried to these places by man . In Australia , far outside the limits of the great continental faunas , are two fishes of supposedly primary-division fresh-water families . The osteoglossid Scleropages leichhardti , a large fish 2 or 3 feet long , inhabits rivers of parts of tropical Queensland and southern New Guinea . Another species often placed in the same genus occurs in the eastern Orient . This genus spans the gap between Asia and Australia in a way that no other living primary-division fishes do . The osteoglossids have been thought of as ancient since Regan 's time ( 1911 ) but , known first in the early Tertiary , they are no older as fossils than the Ostariophysi or some other existing fresh-water fishes , and their relationships do not suggest great antiquity . We do not know to what extent they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters brackish water , and a supposed osteoglossid is fossil in marine strata in the English Eocene . Whether Scleropages reached Australia through river systems over an ancient land connection or partly through the sea I shall not try to say . It is surely a case which should be interpreted with caution . The Australian lungfish , Epiceratodus forsteri , is known to live only in the middle parts of two small river systems , the Mary and the  | Burnett , in subtropical southeastern Queensland . It is not directly related to the living lungfishes of Africa and South America but to fossil forms which appeared in the Triassic and occurred over most of the world in the Mesozoic . It is a relict of a family much more ancient than the osteoglossids . It is the only undoubted relict of an ancient fresh-water family outside the limits of the great continental fish faunas . But we know so little of the tolerances of fishes , especially of ancient ones , that we can not say for sure that even this one must have reached Australia entirely through fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishes , each separate group of them is still more limited . No family is cosmopolitan or even nearly so . The Osteoglossidae and Nandidae might be called tropicopolitan ( except that nandids do not reach the Australian Region ) , but their representatives are somewhat localized within the tropical regions ; and it is not quite certain that they have dispersed entirely through fresh water . The family Cyprinidae , which extends over almost the whole of tropical and temperate Eurasia , Africa , and North America , but which does not reach the Australian Region or South America , has the widest essentially continuous dis.tribution of any primary-division family . A few primary-division genera , such as Barbus ( Cyprinidae ) , Clarius ( catfishes ) , Anabas and Ophicephalus ( labyrinth fishes ) , and Mastacembelus ( spiny eels ) , extend over most of the length of Africa plus most of the width of southern Asia . Esox is almost continuously distributed across northern Eurasia and northern and eastern North America . A few other primary-division genera are common to Eurasia and North America but are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly fresh-water fish is probably the Pike ( Esox lucius ) , which occurs across the whole width of northern Eurasia and North America . Within the limits described above , many fresh-water fishes range along climatic zones more than along continuity of land . The northtemperate zone and the tropical zone of the world have great , distinct assemblages of primary- and secondary-division families . The arctic and south-temperate zones lack well-defined faunas of strictly freshwater families but have many peripheral fishes . These fishes , too , are zoned with climate . Peripheral salmonids and their allies dominate arctic fresh waters ; they occur southward through most of the north-temperate zone , but nowhere enter truly tropical waters . In  | the tropics , gobies are the commonest peripheral fishes , although they are not exclusively tropical ; and many other tropical marine families occur in fresh water to some extent . In the south-temperate zone , galaxiids and their relatives are the most conspicuously zoned peripheral fishes . The genus Galaxias , with forty or more species , all living in or at least entering fresh water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on southern Australia and Tasmania , Lord Howe Island , New Zealand , southern South America , and the southern tip of Africa ( see list of fish families for further details ) . Lampreys , too , are zoned , in the southern hemisphere as well as in the north ; in their southern zone , they enter fresh water in southern Australia , Tasmania , New Zealand , and south-temperate South America , but not in South Africa . Many marine fishes , too , are zoned with climate : the great shorefish faunas of the tropics around the world are remarkably similar in many respects , and are relatively distinct from the temperate faunas immediately north and south of them ( Myers 1940 ) . Some marine families are characteristic of both north- and south-temperate zones but are absent or poorly represented in the tropics ( see Myxinidae , Gadidae , and Cottidae in the list of fish families ? and see also Hubbs 1952 ) , and others are characteristic of either northern or far southern seas . That so many peripheral and marine fishes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single climatic zones shows that climate has a profound influence on their distribution . Zonal climate apparently has a profound influence on the distribution of true fresh-water fishes too , although its importance is not always recognized . To analyze the zonation of true fresh-water fishes , it is best to divide them into two groups suggested earlier in this chapter . In one group go all except the order Ostariophysi , in the other the Ostariophysi alone . It is mainly the non-ostariophysans that are zoned with climate ( Fig. 12 ) . Sixteen families of them are tropical : thirteen occur in Africa ; nine , in the Orient ( six shared with Africa ) ; and three , in South America ( all shared with Africa and two also with the Orient ) . The seven peculiar African families all belong to ancient or generalized orders and include some very archaic forms . The three peculiar Oriental families are higher , spiny-rayed fishes presumably more recent in origin . As compared with Africa , the Orient is notable for its lack of archaic fresh-water fishes . The South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that all of them occur also in the Old World tropics , and for their phylogenetic diversity : they include  | one group of archaic non-teleosts , one of Isospondyli , and one of spinyrayed fishes . Although these sixteen families form a zonal fauna , which is almost confined to the tropics and some parts of which go around the world , it is plain that the fauna differs profoundly on the different continents , and the differences presumably reflect differences  | in the histories of the continents as well as in the evolution and dispersal of different groups of fishes . Nine families of non-ostariophysan primary-division fishes ( not counting arctic Dalliidae ) are north-temperate . All nine are represented in eastern North America . Only five of the nine are represented in America west of the Rocky Mountains , and they are all very localized there ( for details see discussion of fresh-water fishes of North America , below ) . Only four of the nine are represented in Eurasia : the Esocidae ( Fig. 10 ) and Percidae ( Fig. 13 ) are widely distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by single , relict species in China tnd eastern Europe , respectively . The line between the tropics and the north-temperate zone is crossed by very few of the fishes under discussion . ( It must be remembered that for the moment discussion is limited to non ' - ostariophysan primary-division fishes , Fig. 12 ) . In America , none crosses it ; in fact none even enters Central America . In Africa , some tropical families follow the Nile nearly to its mouth and so enter the edge of the northtemperate zone , but they do not occur in truly temperate waters . Only in eastern Asia is there any overlapping of temperate and tropical groups . Of three temperate families in eastern Asia , none reaches the tropics and all are in fact either relict ( Polyodontidae in China ) or confined to the far north ( Esocidae in the Amur and northward , Percidae only north of the Amur ) . But of the nine tropical Oriental families , three enter the temperate zone : the Anabantidae and Mastacembelidae reach North China , and the Channidae ( Ophicephalidae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genera ; there is little endemism even of species near their northern limits ;  | and their temperate ranges are much smaller than and continuous with their great ranges in the Old World tropics . All this indicates that , in eastern Asia , temperate families have withdrawn and tropical families have pushed northward into the temperate zone . The non-ostariophysan primary-division fishes have had diverse origins . The lungfishes and polypterids may have evolved continuously in fresh water , but all the other main groups have probably come independently from the sea , although when and where they did so is unknown . Some of them have apparently had complicated dispersals in fresh water , but others may simply have persisted at and near their places of origin . Fossils show two significant things . First , they show that some families have existed in the north-temperate zone since the Eocene and during the Tertiary have tended to withdraw from Eurasia and western North America and to survive in eastern North America ; the distribution of some of the survivors ( Fig. 12 ) confirms the withdrawals . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from still greater areas . The Osteoglossidae , whatever their origin , have withdrawn from the north-temperate zone and survived in the tropics during the Tertiary . And ceratodontid lungfishes , which occurred in fresh water over most of the world in the Mesozoic , have been reduced to one species in two small Australian rivers . The fresh-water fishes of the secondary division , all of which are non-ostariophysan bony fishes , have zonal distributions too but overlap climatic boundaries to some extent . Gar pikes now occur in temperate eastern North America and part of Central America , and on Cuba . They are fossil in temperate Asia and Europe as well as in North America in the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary , and in tropical India probably in the early Tertiary . They are therefore an old , mainly north-temperate group , but they once occurred in the tropics in Asia , and they have pushed farther into the American tropics than any other northern fresh-water fishes have done . However , they have not reached South America and do not meet the main South American fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world excepting the Australian Region , but they occur also north and south of the tropics well into the temperate zones , especially in America . Cichlids are chiefly in the African and American tropics , although a few occur in neighboring warm-temperate areas , and a few are on southern India and certain islands ( see list of families for details ) .  | The distribution of the order Ostariophysi is less zonal than that of the non-ostariophysans . Characins and most catfishes are mainly tropical but are not fully zoned . Cyprinids and allied fishes have a pattern of distribution which is not primarily zonal at all , although there is a tendency toward zonation of certain genera or groups of genera of less than family rank . The main pattern of distribution of the cypriniform families is radial rather than zonal ; they lie along continuities of land outward from one main distribution center . The center is tropical Asia ? the Oriental Region . Homalopteridae are confined to that region . Cobitidae are most numerous and diverse there , but a few of them extend over almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( suckers ) , which now occur mostly in North America , do not themselves have a radial pattern of distribution , but they fit into the radial pattern of the cypriniforms as a whole . Cyprinidae are very diverse in tropical Asia ; a good many extend over the whole of temperate Eurasia ; comparatively few stocks reach Africa , but some of them extend over the whole of that continent ; and a few stocks reach North America and extend over most of that continent too . This is the existing pattern of distribution of cypriniforms . Their fossil record ( summarized by Romer 1945 , p. 583 ) is too scanty to prove much , but is consistent with the fishes having formed the existing pattern by evolution in and movements outward from the Orient , chiefly during the Tertiary ( Fig. 14 ) . Stated briefly , the difference between the distribution patterns of the non-ostariophysan primary-division fishes and of the Ostariophysi is this . The non-ostariophysans form a chiefly zonal pattern ( Fig. 12 ) : all of the families are confined , or nearly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the tropical families occur around the world , in all the principal tropical regions of fresh-water fishes ; and several north-temperate families occur entirely around the northern hemisphere or did so in the past . The Ostariophysi are much less zonal in distribution : they are much more numerous in species and somewhat more numerous in families than the non-ostariophysans , but no family follows a single climatic zone around the world . Some of the groups are partly zoned , but the pattern of distribution of the most dominant group , the cypriniforms , is primarily radial , and its radiation appears to have been from a center in tropical southeastern Asia . Over a longer period of time , the whole of the Ostariophysi may have radiated from the Old World tropics ( Fig. 14 ) . This fol- lows if the South American forms are derived from the Old World , and if , within the Old World , movement has been from the tropics into temperate areas , as it seems to have been . The zonal and radial patterns are not completely distinct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , especially the labyrinth fishes ( Anabantidae and Channidae ) , have incipiently radial distributions . And although the Ostariophysi have a primarily radial distribution , some of them are partly zoned or localized in single zones . Moreover , the zonal pattern of the non-ostariophysans includes many localizations , discontinuities , and other indications of retreat ( fossils ) . And the radial pattern of the Ostariophysi includes more continuity , and other indications of spreading . All this suggests that the radial pattern may mark an early stage in the dispersal of dominant groups of fresh-water fishes , and zonation a later stage in their history . Zonation is a kind of localization , and it may be a stage through which formerly dominant but retreating groups  | pass on their way to further localization and final extinction . This suggests a correlation between dominance and pattern of distribution which will be considered in more detail later . Of course , not all zoned groups need have the same history . Some ( perhaps salmonids ? ) may always be zoned because of their special limitations or adaptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh-water fishes over the whole world or large parts of it . The pattern of their distribution over each continent is now to be described briefly . Maps of the continents ( or of the continental faunal regions ) will be found in Chapter 7 . Fresh-water fishes of Africa . Africa possesses a diverse fresh-water fish fauna of which the composition is indicated in Figures 12 and 14 . To supplement Figure 14 , it should be said that , in Africa , cyprinids , characins , and catfishes are numerous and widely distributed , though not evenly so , but that only two localized cobitids are known there . Leading references to the distribution of fishes in Africa are Boulenger ( 1905 , 1909 ? 1916 ) ; Pellegrin ( 1912 ; 1921 ; 1933 , pp. 10 ? 19 ) ; and Nichols and Griscom ( 1917 , pp. 739-752 ) . Additional special references are given in the discussion which follows . The African fresh-water fish fauna is richest and most diverse in tropical West Africa , from the Senegal River to the Congo , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generalized groups of African fresh-water fishes ( see Fig. 12 ) are best represented in the westtropical area , and some are confined to it . Much of this fauna extends through the Chad Basin to the upper Nile , and part of it follows the Nile down to its lower reaches or even to its mouth ( Boulenger 1907 ) . Many fishes of the Niger , Lake Chad , and the Nile are identical or closely related , suggesting recent connections between these water systems . The fishes of the Congo , though of the same general groups , are more distinct and have probably been isolated for a longer time . The headwaters of the Nile and affluents of the Congo are actually connected at flood season now , but the connection is probably a recent one and comparatively few fishes seem to have dispersed through it . The Congo and the Zambezi seem to have exchanged some fishes , but not their whole faunas ; the Zambezi has a moderately rich fish fauna but lacks polypterids and some other tropical West African groups . The cast-flowing rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are relatively small and have a still more limited fish fauna , again lacking polypterids and other characteristic West African groups . This lack is partly made up by the presence of many species ( but few genera ) of Cyprinidae , which are comparatively few in West Africa , and which are thought to have reached eastern Africa from the north ( from Asia ) , as a cobitid near Lake Tana has evidently done . The great lakes of east-central Africa have highly endemic fish faunas dominated by cichlids , although a few other fishes are present ( Brooks 1950 ) . Lake Nyasa alone is credited with something like 178 species of cichlids , of which 174 are endemic , in 20 endemic genera . Southward , south of the Zambezi , which itself has a somewhat depauperate fauna ( see above ) , fresh-water fishes become progressively fewer ( details from Barnard 1943 , 1948 ) . One genus of characins , but apparently only one , reaches the Limpopo and slightly beyond . Secondary-division cyprinodonts reach south of the Zambezi but fall far short of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of East London but not the actual Cape region . Two primary-division families of catfishes , Clariidae and Bagridae , reach the Orange River or even slightly beyond , but not the final southernmost drainages . The latter , the small rivers that drain the truncated tip of Africa , are reached by only two truly freshwater fish families : Anabantidae and Cyprinidae . The Anabantidae are discontinuously distributed . The tropical forms do not go south of the Zambezi , but two endemic species ( possibly forming a separate genus , Sandelia ) are isolated on the southern tip of the continent . The Cyprinidae are more or less continuously distributed but have evolved an endemic group of species in the extreme south . That the cyprinids , which are comparatively recent in Africa , are the only strictly fresh-water fishes that range continuously to the southern tip of the continent is a fact to be noted . There are also several peripheral fishes in South African fresh waters , including a galaxiid . The latter , which is placed in an endemic subgenus , is common along most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olifants River on the west . It is a variable species with two intergrading forms , a mountain and a lake ( Vlei ) form . It apparently does not enter the sea , as some of the Australian and South American members of the family do . Northward in Africa , the great area of the Sahara Desert is inhabited by a few fresh-water fishes ( Pellegrin 1921 , 1937 ) . Of primary division groups there are a few cyprinids and two species of catfishes  | of the genus Clarias , and of secondary-division ones there are a few cyprinodonts and three genera of cichlids . All these families are widely scattered in the Sahara in oases , and some species , the same species that occur above ground , have been found in underground waters too ( see references given under Cichlidae in list of fish families ) . These fishes are probably relicts from a time not long ago when the Sahara was wetter than now . Their geographical relationships are mixed . At least some of the cyprinids and cyprinodonts seem to be northern ( Mediterranean ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical . Finally , the northwestern corner of Africa ( Pellegrin 1921 ) , including the Atlas Mountains and the coastal area north of them , has a fresh-water fish fauna very different from that of the main part of Africa . The species are few , presumably because fresh water is limited and in part seasonal . This region has , of primary-division fishes , only Cyprinidae , some with European and some with " eastern " relationships , and one European cobitid . It has also a few secondarydivision cyprinodonts , a trout in the mountain streams and a stickleback near the coast , both , of course , representing northern peripheral families , and an eel and other peripheral fishes . Catfishes , cichlids , and all other typical tropical African fresh-water fishes are absent . The pattern of distribution of African fresh-water fishes is , then , this : great richness , together with a diversity of ancient stocks equaled nowhere else in the world , from the west-tropical area to the Nile , and richest of all in the Congo ; moderate poverty in the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) origin ; local radiation especially of cichlids in the great lakes ; progressive poverty southward to the Cape ; still greater poverty in the Sahara , but a few fishes still present in isolated waters ; and , with tenuous transition , isolation in the northwestern corner of the continent of a very different , very limited fresh-water fish fauna closely related to that of Europe . This pattern is obviously determined partly by local climates , apparently partly by size of drainage systems ( the larger the rivers , the more , and the more diverse , the fishes ) , and partly by the histories of different drainage systems . Of the origin and dispersal of the older groups of African freshwater fishes , little is known . The more recent cyprinids and cobitids have apparently come from Asia . Some of the spiny-rayed groups are apparently also of Asiatic origin ( see Fig. 12 ) . Fresh-water fishes of Eurasia . The composition of the fresh-water fish fauna of Asia and Europe is indicated in Figures 12 and 14 , but  | the figures do not fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no single , good study of the distribution of fishes over this whole area , but parts of it are covered by Pellegrin 1923 ( Syria ) ; Kosswig 1952 ( Turkey ) , Hora 1934 ( Afghanistan ) ; Day 1889 ( and Hora in various papers ( India , etc . ) ; H. M. Smith 1945 ( Thailand ) ; Weber and Beaufort 1911 ? 1951 ( Sunda Islands , etc . ) ; Nichols 1943 ( China ) ; Mori 1936 ( eastern Asia and Japan ) ; Berg 1936 ( Eurasia except the tropics ) , 1932 ( Europe ) , and other papers culminating in a final edition of his Fresh-water fishes of Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( 1948-1949 , 3 volumes , in Russian , but with a table in Volume 3 , pp. 1196-1233 , giving distributions of every species by river basins , with the names of both fishes and rivers in Roman type ) ; and many other authors , of whom a few are cited in the following discussion . The main part of tropical Asia with the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borneo ) has a large fresh-water fish fauna , which is extremely rich in cyprinids and their allies and moderately rich in spiny-rayed fishes but which lacks all the archaic and almost all the isospondyl families of Africa . The fauna as a whole is relatively uniformly distributed through the eastern part of the . Oriental Region ( Indochina , etc. ) to Java and Borneo . Its distribution evidently dates from a recent land connection between the islands and the mainland . In fact the distribution of fresh-water fishes on the islands follows in some detail the old river systems of which the lower courses are now drowned by the sea ( Fig. 59 , p. 489 ) . This main Oriental fauna includes a great variety of lowland fishes and also some families and parts of families specialized for life in mountain torrents . Many , but not all , of the lowland groups extend westward more or less continuously into peninsular India ( Hora 1944 ) . The torrent fishes can not do this now for lack of a continuous series of mountain streams , but nevertheless some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hora ( 1949 ) lists fifteen such species in half a dozen families in peninsular India , widely separated from their relatives or from other populations of the same species farther east . He suggests that these fishes invaded India not much before the Pliocene ( too late for fishes of this sort to reach Ceylon ) , and that they crossed India via the Satpuras and other hills when the latter were more continuous and wetter than now . Many torrent fishes occur in northern ( not peninsular ) India , in streams on the south face of the Himalayas , but their origin ( from the east ) is easier to understand .  | On the north face of the Himalayas and elsewhere in high central Asia the fish fauna is much more limited and consists primarily of a peculiar group of cyprinids ( Schizothoracinae ) , one genus of cobitids ( Nemacheilus ) , and one genus of sisorid catfishes ( Glyptosternum ) , all able to live in mountain torrents and all apparently derived from the east . That is , they have apparently dispersed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to north across them ( Hora 1937 , and other authors ) . Some other fishes reach the central highlands of Asia from one direction or another but are not so widely distributed there . In eastern Asia , from the tropics northward through China , there is a steady change of fishes . Some of the tropical families do not reach the temperate zone at all . Hornalopterids and sisorid catfishes reach the Yangtze Kiang , in which occur also the temperate-relict paddlefish and Chinese sucker and , in the upper reaches , salmonids . These fishes do not all occur together , but they are all in the same river system . Other tropical families extend for varying distances farther north , and silurid and bagrid catfishes and the labyrinth family Channidae reach the Amur , where they occur with many temperate fishes including a pike and peripheral lampreys , sturgeons , salmonids , cottids , sticklebacks , and Lota . This brief statement is , of course , a very great simplification of a complex situation . The south-north transition of main groups of fresh-water fishes is complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interdigitation ( Nichols 1943 , p. 5 ) of the Chinese fishes with those of the interior Asiatic highlands . The pattern is still further complicated by a great diversity of Cyprinidae , there being within this family a complex transition from southern to northern genera . Under these circumstances it is not surprising that ichthyologists argue about where to draw faunal lines . Berg ( 1936 ) considered that most of China is dominated by tropical fishes and should be included in the tropical Oriental Region . Mori ( 1936 ) considered that only southernmost China should be included in the Oriental Region , the main part of it being Palearctic ( Old World north-temperate ) . He put the dividing line at the southern Nan Shan ( Nan Ling ) Mountains not far north of the Tropic of Cancer , and Nichols ( 1943 , p. 5 ) , too , finds a not very well-marked faunal line for fishes near the line between the tropical and north-temperate zones . Just how the line is drawn is unimportant compared to the main fact , that the Chinese fresh-water fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transition covering an enormous area from within the tropics to the Amur River , which is at the latitude of British Columbia .  | Northern Asia , north of the Amur and north of the central highlands , has a fish fauna consisting of some cyprinids , a few cobitids , the Pike , a couple of percids , and , especially in the far north , many salmonids and other northern peripheral fishes . One of the latter , a cottid , has radiated in Lake Baikal , to form two endemic families ( Comephoridae and Cottocomephoridae ) with nine genera and sixteen or eighteen species ( see list of fish families ) . Northern Europe shares the greater part of the widely distributed , far-northern Asiatic fish fauna . Much of it reaches England and some , but less , Ireland . Farther south in Europe are a few , but only a few , other fishes . A big catfish , Silurus glanis , which occurs east to the Aral region , ranges west to the Rhine . In southeastern Europe , especially in rivers entering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percids ( several genera and about ten species ) and an umbrid minnow , the latter confined to parts of the Danube and Dniester Rivers . The European fresh-water fish fauna is dominated by cyprinids , of which some are wide-ranging but others endemic or relict , especially in southeastern Europe , in the Balkans . Mediterranean Europe has a few secondary-division cyprinodonts . A catfish of the Asiatic genus Parasilurus is isolated in Greece . But southern Europe apparently has no primary-division fishes derived from the south , from Africa . This poor European fauna becomes poorer still in Spain and southern Italy , where the only primary-division fishes are a number of cyprinids and two cobitids ( which are cypriniforms ) ? no catfishes , no Pike , no percids . This lack is compensated for by the presence of various peripheral fishes of Mediterranean ( warm-temperate ) groups . The southwestern corner of Asia , nearest Africa , from Asia Minor to Arabia and Iran , is not very hospitable to fishes and has only a limited variety of them . Most are cyprinids , of which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genera Barbus and Garra occur even in isolated waters in southern Arabia ( Trewavas 1941 ) . There are in southwestern Asia also a few cobitids and cyprinodonts and a very few other primary- and secondary-division fishes of diverse relationships : African cichlids reach Syria and Palestine and have evolved an endemic genus and several species there ; a very few catfishes of widely distributed tropical groups are in Syria and the Euphrates-Tigris system , and a ( tropical ) mastacembelid is in the Euphrates-Tigris . The big European catfish and the Pike reach northern Asia Minor . A little farther east , in Afghanistan and probably also in southern Iran , various Indian fishes appear ; and in northern Afghanistan are a ( northern ) trout and peculiar groups of cy- prinids and catfishes from central Asia . It will be seen that dry southwestern Asia is a region of double transition of fish faunas , the transition being from African to Oriental forms in one direction , and from tropical to northern forms in another . The details of the double transition are not yet very well known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , then , this : richness , in spite of absence of archaic groups , in the main tropical part of Asia and on the recent continental islands of the Sunda shelf ; poverty and specialization in the central highlands ; transition involving many groups over a great area through eastern Asia from the tropics north to the Amur ; wide east-west distribution of special northern groups , with evolution of endemic families ( of peripheral origin ) in Lake Baikal ; poverty in Europe , increasing westward and in Spain and southern Italy , but with a few additional endemic and/or relict groups in southeastern Europe ; and poverty and two-way transition in southwestern Asia . As to movements of Eurasia fishes , cyprinids and their allies and perhaps certain other fishes seem to have evolved in and spread north and west from the Asiatic tropics , and other fishes , particularly the older north-temperate forms , seem to have withdrawn before them . This is suggested by the relationships and distribution of the cypriniforms themselves and by their obvious success in a great variety of climates and habitats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fauna in eastern Asia , where north-temperate fishes seem to have withdrawn and tropical groups including cyprinids seem to have spread northward into the temperate zone ; and by the small number of other fishes in temperate Eurasia , and by the relict distributions of some of them . The movements of fishes in temperate Asia and Europe during and after Pleistocene glaciation is a special subject not treated in detail here ; references to it are given in Chapter 10 . Fresh-water fishes of North America . The composition of the freshwater fish fauna of North America , too , is indicated in Figures 12 and 14 . This fauna consists of a larger variety of non-ostariophysans than occur in temperate Eurasia but of a smaller basic variety of Ostariophysi , although the three ostariophysan families that do occur in North America are numerous in species there . ( Two additional South American families of Ostariophysi just reach the southern edge of North America . ) Known North American fresh-water fishes were all included in the check list of Jordan et al . ( 1930 ) . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America ( one  | is much needed ) , but there are a number of good local faunal works , of which I have found Hubbs and Lagler ( 1947 ) especially useful . The main North American fresh-water fish fauna is concentrated in the east-central part of the continent ( see Fig. 12 ) , in the Mississippi River and its tributaries . The much smaller , east-flowing rivers of the Atlantic coast are all poorer in fishes than the Mississippi , and their poverty becomes acute in the northeast . In New Hampshire ( Carpenter and Siegler 1947 ) , for example , the native primary-division fishes are only two Esox , three small centrarchids , three percids , and , of Ostariophysi , fourteen small cyprinids , three catostomids , and two ameiurid catfishes ; the Pike , two black basses , three other centrarchids , the Pike Perch , etc. , are introduced . In Nova Scotia ( Livingstone 1953 ) , native , strictly fresh-water fishes are still fewer : only one percid , eight cyprinids , one catostomid , one catfish , and one ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isthmus which connects Nova Scotia to the mainland , but fewer than half of them reach the southern tip of Nova Scotia or northern Cape Breton Island , and some isolated Nova Scotian streams have no strictly freshwater fishes . The sparsity of fishes northeastward is probably partly a result of the failure of some of them , especially the larger ones , to return to the more isolated coastal rivers since the retreat of Pleistocene ice . To the southwest and west the great fish fauna of the Mississippi diminishes rapidly . Of the non-ostariophysan primary-division families , only the Centrarchidae and Percidae reach Mexico , finding their southern limits about on the line of the tropics there . All three North American families of Ostariophysi go south slightly or considerably beyond this , however , and so do secondary-division groups . Their limits are given in more detail in discussion of the fresh-water fishes of Central America ( pp. 72ff . ) . In the western United States , west of the continental divide , which follows the Rocky Mountains , there are only three known native species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each forming an endemic genus , and each confined to a different drainage system . They are Novumbra hubbsi ( Umbridae ) in the Chehalis River of Washington ; Columbia transmontana ( Percopsidae ) in the Columbia River of Oregon and Washington ; and Archoplites interruptus ( Centrarchidae ) in the Sacramento and San Joaquin river system in California . A fourth 1 species , Rafinesquiellus pottsii , representing still another family ( Percidae ) , reaches west-flowing rivers in Mexico . The Pike ( Esoc- idae ) reaches western drainage only in Alaska . The Trout Perch ( Percopsidae ) reaches at least the upper part of the west-flowing Yukon . And the Blackfish , Dallia , is , of course , confined in America to west-draining areas in Alaska . Of Ostariophysi west of the divide , there are catostomids and a number of small cyprinids but no native catfishes except two or three in western Mexico . Southward in the west there are also some secondary-division cyprinodonts . Some of the cyprinids and cyprinodonts occur in relict waters in even the most arid parts of the southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east-central North America diminishes progressively . A rather small part of it enters the arctic along the Mackenzie ; a still smaller part occurs in truly arctic habitats on the tundra ; and primary-division fishes apparently entirely fail to reach some remote tundra regions , including , perhaps , parts of the Labrador peninsula . Only three primary-division species are widely distributed in Alaska , although at least two more may enter Alaska along the Yukon . The three are the Pike , the Northern Sucker , and Dallia . All three , but no more-southern primary-division American species , occur also in Asia across Bering Strait , and this suggests a recent , cold land bridge there . Most of the arctic fresh-water fishes of North America are , of course , peripheral ones much like those of Asia and Europe , and they show transition or relationships in both directions . For example , several species of salmon are common to northwestern North America and northeastern Asia , and the Atlantic Salmon ( Salmo salar ) is common to northeastern North America and Europe . Of primary-division fishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America and Europe , but there are relationships between some eastern North American and European forms , including Umbra , some percids , and some cyprinids . Berg ( 1932 , p. 178 ) has discussed this in more detail . The main pattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes in North America is , then , this : richness and diversity in the east , especially in the largest river system , the Mississippi ; some reduction of richness along the Atlantic coast , and increasing poverty northeastward ; progressive poverty , at least of primary-division groups , southwestward and through Mexico ; limitation west of the continental divide to cyprinids , catostomids , cyprinodonts , and a very few , scattered representatives of other eastern families ( with some peripheral fishes chiefly near the coast ) ; and transition northward to an arctic fauna of a few primary-division and many peripheral fishes closely related toward  | northern Asia and ( in the case of some northeastern peripheral forms ) northern Europe . As to origins and movements , much of the existing North American fresh-water fish fauna is apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Europe , northern Asia , and North America ( Berg 1932 , p. 178 ) . Most of the non-ostariophysan primary-division families of this fauna ( Fig. 12 ) have died out in western North America ( they have declined or died out in Europe and especially in Asia , too ) and survived or even radiated , as the percids have done , in eastern North America . There are also some important non-ostariophysans ( e.g. , perhaps the centrarchids ) in eastern North America which may have originated there . Finally the three families of Ostariophysi in North America seem to be immigrants from eastern Asia . Just when they arrived is uncertain : ameiurid catfishes and catostomids may have come in the early Tertiary , cyprinids in the Miocene . The effect of the Pleistocene on North American , as on Eurasian , fishes is visible in several ways noted in Chapter 10 . Fresh-water fishes of South America . The South American freshwater fish fauna is remarkable on the one hand for its small number of ancestral stocks and on the other for richness and endemism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 12 ) , only three families are known in South America , and they total only five known species there . Of Ostariophysi ( Fig. 14 ) , South America has only characins , gymnotid eels ( which are derived from characins ) , and catfishes ( no cypriniforms ) , but they total nearly 2000 known species in South America , with many endemic genera and about 17 endemic families , plus one family ( Characidae ) which is shared with Africa . South America has also a number of secondary-division cyprinodonts and cichlids and some peripheral fishes . This fauna has long attracted the attention of ichthyologists , and the main features of its distribution have been worked out especially by Eigenmann ( 1909 , 1910 , 1927 , 1942 with Allen , etc . ) . The main fresh-water fish fauna of South America centers in the Amazon and its tributaries . This is by far the richest river system in the world in number of fishes . Known species of Amazonian fishes of all kinds now number well over 1000 and may approach 2000 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , p. 13 ) . Of catfishes alone the Amazon system is known to have more than 450 species , compared with less than 20 species from the whole of the much better known Mississippi system ( Myers ) ! Characins almost equal the catfishes in variety and far surpass them in numbers of  | individuals , and the Amazon possesses also its share of gymnotid eels , all three families of non-ostariophysan primary-division fishes that occur in South America , various secondary-division cyprinodonts and cichlids , and some peripheral fishes . Many groups of Amazonian fishes but not all , for example not the lungfish , reach the Guianas and the Orinoco ; and many but again not all , for example not the osteoglossids or nandids , reach the Paraguay-Parana system . The headwaters of these rivers come close to the Amazon system and may even be connected with it . The somewhat smaller and more isolated Magdalena near the northwestern corner of South America , though still a fine river , has a more limited fish fauna ( Miles 1947 ) , which lacks , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known fishes of the Magdalena number 149 , as follows : 58 characins , 6 gymnotid eels , 67 catfishes , 5 cyprinodonts in 2 families , 4 cichlids , and 9 peripheral fishes in 7 families . The eastern coastal rivers of Brazil , south of the Amazon and north of the Parana , are for the most part rather small . Their fish faunas are limited but are related to that of the Amazon . The narrow western watershed of tropical South America , west of the Andes , has a very uneven fish fauna . There are fair numbers of true fresh-water fishes on the Pacific watershed of Colombia and Ecuador ; the fishes on the two sides of this part of the Andes are in fact more alike than those on the two sides of the Rocky Mountains . Some of the western Colombian forms have apparently come around the northern end of the mountains from the east . Those of the western slope of Ecuador have apparently been derived from the Amazon either across the Andes or before the Andes were formed ( Eigenmann 1927 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942 ) . Below Ecuador , from Peru southward , the narrow , dry Pacific watershed west of the Andes has few fresh-water fishes . The high Andes themselves have a limited , specialized fauna of torrent fishes consisting chiefly , at highest altitudes ( sometimes up to 14,000 feet ) in the equatorial zone above the Amazon , of one genus of characins ( Lebiasina ) and two of catfishes ( Astroblepus and Pygidium ) ( Myers 1947 ? 1949 , Part 4 , p. 12 ) . This fauna follows the Andes for nearly their whole length , from their northern end south into Chile and Patagonia , with some local changes in composition : e.g. , the genus Hatcheria , related to Pygidium , is endemic to parts of Chile and northern Patagonia . At somewhat lower altitudes in the equatorial Andes other fishes appear , living in moderately swift water , and below 2000 or 3000 feet the number and variety increases rapidly  | and there is complex transition to the lowland fauna . The latter is extremely complex ecologically as well as very rich ( Myers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high Andes , the Altiplano of southern Peru , including Lake Titicaca ( over 12,000 feet ) , possesses an endemic subfamily of cyprinodonts , the Orestiinae , of four genera and about twenty species , most in Lake Titicaca itself ( Brooks 1950 , p. 162 ) . There is only one other fish , a catfish , in the Titicaca basin . Much of the tropical lowland fish fauna goes south to the mouth of the Paraguay-Parana system , following these rivers into the southtemperate zone ( Eigenmann 1909 , p. 230 ) as some African fishes do the Nile into the north-temperate . Except for this , there is a steady reduction of the fresh-water fish fauna southward , beginning even in southeastern Brazil , and below Buenos Aires the poverty of freshwater fishes becomes acute . Of primary-division fishes , only a few characins and catfishes reach Chile and Patagonia . Some of them are closely related to and obviously derived from widely distributed tropical South American forms , but one of the genera of catfishes is supposedly the most primitive living American catfish and is placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to parts of central Chile and central Argentina , and another catfish , Nematogenys , is supposedly the most primitive living pygidiid and is confined to part of Chile ( Eigenmann 1927 , p. 13 ) . The geographical history of these genera is unknown , but it is a reasonable guess that they are relicts of comparatively primitive groups which have been replaced in the tropical part of South America . The farthest south reached by any characin may be 41 ? 18 ' , by Cheirodon , which lives in quiet lowland waters ( Eigenmann 1927 , p. 14 ) . Hardy , **26;2832;TOOLONG catfishes of the family Pygidiidae go much farther south than this , the genus Hatcheria reaching at least 47 ? 30 ' S. ( Eigenmann 1918 , pp. 269 , 283 ) . Beyond them are only peripheral fishes , which occur to the southern tip of the continent : lampreys , galaxiids , and Aplochiton . These are all " antarctic " peripheral groups which occur also in New Zealand and southern Australia , and which in South America become progressively fewer northward as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1927 , p. 15 ) the antarctic fish fauna as a whole extends north only to Valdivia , one Galaxias and Aplochiton continue north to Concepcion , and only lampreys reach Valparaiso . The antarctic fishes go less far north on the Atlantic side of South America . In the warmer parts of south-temperate South America are a few peripheral fishes of other groups : a mugilid , atherinids , and serranids.  | The main pattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes in South America is , then , this : central richness ( in spite of poverty of ancestral stocks ) greatest in the Amazon , somewhat less in adjacent river systems north and south , and still less in the more isolated Magdalena ; moderate poverty in western drainages of Colombia and Ecuador ; progressive poverty southward beginning in southeastern Brazil but interrupted by the south-flowing Paraguay-Parana system ; poverty and specialization of torrent fishes in the Andes , and radiation of certain cyprinodonts mostly in Lake Titicaca ; and transition in the far south to a completely different fauna , of antarctic peripheral fishes . The origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present richness of the fauna is obviously due almost entirely to evolution on and movements within the continent . There has been much exchange of fishes among the large rivers , but the Amazon , the largest of all , still has much the largest and most diverse fish fauna ; there is here the same general correlation between size of rivers and both number and diversity of fishes which has been noted in Africa and North America . In general , fishes seem to have spread from the Amazon in all possible directions ( Eigenmann 1909 , p. 371 ) . The northern Andes seem not to have been much of a barrier ; a number of fishes have got around or across them . Southward from the Amazon the fish fauna changes mostly by subtraction ( this phrase is from Eigenmann and Allen 1942 , p. 62 ) , and the subtraction continues until , south of the La Plata region , only a few characins and catfishes are left , and then only catfishes , and finally no strictly fresh-water fishes at all . Eigenmann tried to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America into separate parts , a main Archamazonia and a southern Archiplata ( 1909 , p. 370 ) , or an Archibrazil and an Archiguyana ( Eigenmann and Allen 1942 , p. 35 ) , each with its independent fish fauna , but I can not see it . There seems to be only one main South American fauna of true fresh-water fishes , which radiates from the Amazon , and parts of which are extended or subtracted or localized or specialized in different places about as would be expected in the diverse habitats of a continent like South America . Fresh-water fishes of Central America . Although Central America is neither a continent nor a principal faunal region , it is a transition area of such importance that it deserves separate treatment . Some earlier discussions of the distribution of fishes in this area are by Regan ( 1906-1908 , pp . XII ? XXXII ) , Eigenmann ( 1909 , pp. 309-310 ) , and Myers ( 1938 , pp. 350 ? 351 ) . All Central American fishes known at that time are included in the list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water fishes of Panama , which is a critical area , are treated by Hildebrand ( 1938 ) . And papers by Buen ( 1946 ) and Miles ( 1947 ) on the fishes of Mexico and of the Rio Magdalena , though not directly concerned with the Central American fauna , are important in connection with its nature and origin . A map of Central America will be found in Chapter 7 , p. 457 . The fresh-water fish fauna of Central America is very depauperate . It completely lacks all the non-ostariophysan primary-division families ( Fig. 12 ) of both North and South America . The disappearance of these fishes actually begins on the continents far short of Central America itself . Of the nine families of them in temperate North America , only two ( Centrarchidae and Percidae ) reach Mexico . Each of these families is represented by several species in the Rio Grande system , but only one species of each goes farther south , about to the edge of the tropics , the centrarchid cast and the percid west of the continental divide . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary-division fishes of South America , none reaches even the Magdalena or the smaller rivers of northwestern South America . The Ostariophysi do better , but even they are few in Central America , and they too are reduced in numbers even on the adjacent edges of the continents . Of North American Ostariophysi , the cyprinids go south , in decreasing numbers , to the Rio Balsas in southern Mexico , within the tropics but short of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . Catostomids go south to Guatemala , also in decreasing numbers : two North American genera stop in the northern edge of Mexico ; a third ( Moxostorna ) stops in south-central Mexico ; and a fourth , Carpiodes , alone reaches Guatemala . Ameiurid catfishes disappear progressively south . ward in a similar manner , only Ictahurus reaching Guatemala . Of South American Ostariophysi , there is some loss of main groups even in the Magdalena . A good many do reach Panama , but very few go farther . In fact , few of those that enter eastern Panama from South America reach even western Panama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 genera , 32 species of characins in eastern and central Panama , but only 5 genera , 9 species of them in western Panama ; and against 7 species of loricariid catfishes , some of them common , in central Panama , only one is known in the western part of the country . Still fewer South American ostariophysans range farther into Central America , and they reach different limits . Of characins , Bramocharax appears to he endemic in Lake Nicaragua ; and of South American genera , Rochoides reaches Guatemala ; Brycon , Guatemala and Yuca- tan ; and Astyanax , tributaries of the Rio Grande in Texas . The single gymnotid eel that is known to range beyond central Panama reaches Guatemala , Of South American fresh-water catfishes , apparently only pimelodids chiefly of the genus Rhamdia go far into Central America , reaching in fact to the Rio Panuco on the east coast of Mexico . I give these details with some trepidation , for they are probably incomplete and perhaps in some cases wrong , but it is only by giving them that the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These fishes are not only few in number but very poor in endemic genera in Central America . The poverty in strictly fresh-water groups is partly made up by disproportionate abundance in salt-tolerant , secondary-division ones . Cichlids are much more numerous in Central than in South America , and the area of their abundance is almost exactly complementary to that of the primary-division fishes : the cichlids become numerous in western Panama ( Hildebrand 1938 , p. 221 ) , where the poverty of primary-division fishes first becomes acute , and , although several genera of them reach Mexico , they taper off there northward , only a single one reaching the Rio Grande and none coming into contact with the full North American fish fauna . The cichlids in Central America show considerable endemism of genera as well as species , although most or all of them seem to be derived from the South American genus Cichlasoina ( Regan , Myers ) . Cyprinodonts too are disproportionately numerous , with a high degree of endemism , in Central America ( Myers 1938 , pp. 350-351 ) . Gar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North American , go south through eastern Mexico and Central America to Lake Nicaragua . There are also a fair number of peripheral fishes in Central American fresh waters . The composition of the fresh-water fish fauna of the more isolated parts of Central America is exemplified by the fishes of the Yucatan Peninsula ( Hubbs 1936 ) , which include only one species ( with two subspecies ) of characin and one species ( with several localized subspecies ) of pimelodid catfish , and no other primary-division forms , but , in the secondary division , thirteen species of cyprinodonts and six of cichlids , and several peripheral fishes . The pattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes in Central America is , then , this : great poverty in strictly fresh-water groups ( no primary division non-ostariophysans , few Ostariophysi ) , the poverty being progressive , North American groups becoming fewer through Mexico and reaching only to Guatemala , and South American groups becoming fewer with distance from South America , although a very few of them  | extend along the whole length of Central America to Mexico , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundance in certain salt-tolerant groups , of which the area of abundance is complementary to that of the strictly fresh-water ones , and among which there is more endemism than among the strictly fresh-water forms . Considered more broadly , Central America is the meeting place of the fringes of two great fish faunas , one north-temperate and the other tropical ( Fig. 15 ) but the transition of faunas involves a much wider area than Central America alone . The North American fauna is best developed in the Mississippi , and subtractions from it occur progressively westward and southward into and through Mexico to the final limit ( of strictly fresh-water forms ) in Guatemala ; and the South American fauna is best developed in the Amazon , and subtractions from it begin even in the other main rivers of South America and become obvious in the Magdalena and acute in Panama , although a  | small fraction of the fauna goes through Central America and reaches the edge of North America . And in the absence of all except a very few strictly fresh-water fishes , there has evolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endemic fauna derived from salttolerant groups . The nature of the Central American fresh-water fish fauna is well accounted for if Central America is biologically a rather recent land which fresh-water fishes have reached with difficulty , the difficulty beginning on the edges of the continents far short of Central America itself . Under these conditions , salt-tolerant fishes would probably be the first to arrive , along coasts or across narrow gaps of salt water , and they would probably then radiate in isolation . Strictly fresh-water fishes would probably arrive later , needing more time to overcome the greater difficulties in their way , or perhaps having to wait for geological changes to reduce the difficulties . It is noteworthy that strictly fresh-water groups have reached Central America more from the south than from the north , and that some southern groups have gone much farther through Central America than any northern ones have done . It is worth ' while now to look again at Myers ' secondary-division of fresh-water fishes . It consists of groups which , although they occur mostly in fresh water , include species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in sea water . These groups are represented on many islands where strictly fresh-water fishes are absent . And these same groups are represented by disproportionately numerous , highly differentiated forms in Central America . These Lets go together . They show important things about the dispersal of the fishes and about the history of some of the lands where the fishes occur . We may , if we wish , doubt the " reality " of Myers ' divisions , but how can we doubt their usefulness in zoogeography ? It is worth while to look again also at the contrasting distributions of the non-ostariophysan primary-division fishes and the Ostariophysi . Of the non-ostariophysans , there are a number of families in North America , and some are old and some are abundant there . Of the Ostariophysi , there are only three families in the main part of North America , and at least some of them are probably rather recent there . But all of the ostariophysan families go farther south in North America than any non-ostariophysan primary-division fishes do . ( These three families of Ostariophysi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an older , non-ostariophysan fish fauna in temperate  | North America . ) This pattern is mirrored in the south : of South American primary-division fishes , only Ostariophysi reach Central America . This is one part of a general difference already noted : that over the world as a whole the non-ostariophysans are primarily zoned , apparently usually not spreading much and often retreating , while the ostariophysans are radiating and spreading . This is a very significant difference . To reveal it may justify even such a cumbrous phrase as " non-ostariophysan primary-division fishes . " Fresh-water fishes of Australia . Besides the lungfish and osteoglossid already discussed , Australia has many peripheral fresh-water fishes . They are included in McCulloch 's ( 1929 ? 1930 ) check list of Australian fishes , and their nature and distribution are briefly described by the same author ( 1927 ) . The fishes best represented in Australian fresh waters are lampreys , galaxiids etc. , catfishes ( of marine families ) , perch-like fishes ( of marine families ) , gobies , and atherinids . Some other marine groups are represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species . There are also several anguillid eels ; and one widely distributed synbranchid and one amphipnoid reach Australia . Finally there are several introduced salmonids and cyprinids , some of the latter now being pests . Some of the native fresh-water ( but peripheral ) fishes are very widely distributed over Australia . Some others , notably the lampreys and the galaxiids etc. , are zoned , confined to the cool southern part of the continent . There is also some localization of species and genera , but the details are not important here . The fresh-water fishes of New Guinea , except perhaps the osteoglossid , are all peripheral , and the New Guinean fish fauna as a whole is closely related to that of Australia . In fact , the southern rivers of New Guinea have fishes ( and other aquatic animals ) of the same species that occur in the rivers of part of the north coast of Australia ( Whitley 1943 ) , suggesting ( as on the Sunda shelf of Asia ) the existence in the Pleistocene of a great river system of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 59 , p. 489 ) . The rivers of northern New Guinea have a related but somewhat different fish fauna , including endemic genera ( Whitley 1943 ) . There is no mystery about the origin of most Australian fresh-water fishes . Except ( perhaps ) for the lungfish and osteoglossid , they have come directly from or through the sea .  | What happens where different , adjacent fresh-water fish faunas meet tells much about the factors that control fish distribution . Usually there is no sharp line of separation but an area of transition or overlapping with progressive subtractions from both faunas , in opposite directions . The extent of the transition varies with the factors concerned . Zonal climatic differences help to separate major fish faunas in several cases , but in only one case is zonal climate the only obvious main factor involved . This is in eastern Asia , where tropical Oriental and temperate Eurasian faunas meet in a great transition involving many fishes in an area nearly 2000 miles wide , from the tropics to the Amur River . Farther west in Asia , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is only a little mixing of tropical and temperate fish faunas ; and between tropical Africa and temperate Europe the zonal climatic difference is reinforced by a desert and a salt sea , and there is no meeting at all of strictly fresh-water fishes , unless perhaps within the family Cyprinidae . In America , tropical and north-temperate fish faunas are separated not only by zonal climatic differences but by a narrow land bridge which was interrupted by salt water until a very few million years ago , and by a partial barrier of dry country in southwestern North America . Nevertheless a few strictly fresh-water fishes of South and North America meet and overlap in Guatemala and Mexico . In two other cases zonal climatic barriers help to separate fish faunas which themselves are climatically alike . The tropical faunas of Africa and Asia are separated by southwestern Asia , which is warm-temperate rather than tropical , and also relatively dry . This compound barrier has been very effective , for the tropical African and Oriental fish faunas are very different as wholes . Nevertheless a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few have evidently trickled through it in the past . The temperate faunas of Asia and North America are separated by a barrier of arctic climate . They are now separated also by salt water , but that is relatively recent ; climate has apparently been the main barrier . When Asia and North America were most recently connected across Bering Strait , the bridge was apparently so cold that only arctic fishes crossed it . Longer ago , however , the bridge was evidently warmer and many fishes crossed it . Deserts are certainly barriers to fishes , but their effect is probably  | less than is usually supposed . Nowhere are two different , major fish faunas separated by deserts alone , without help of other factors . Some fishes occur in isolated waters in deserts , including the Sahara , showing that the deserts were once wetter than now and less of a barrier to fishes ; and ways are often open to fishes around or across deserts , for example the Nile across the deserts of northern Africa . However , although deserts alone may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are important in combination with other factors . Mountains too are barriers to fishes over short periods of time but are less important over long periods . There are always ways around or across them . Many fishes have got around the mountains of central Asia on the east ; that the lowland fish faunas of southern and northern Asia are so different is an effect of climate more than of the mountain barrier . Fishes have got both around and across the northern Andes . The Rocky Mountains of North America are probably the most effective existing mountain barrier to dispersal of fresh-water fishes , but cyprinids and catostomids as well as cyprinodonts are widely distributed on both sides of them ; at least three other fishes have crossed them in the United States ; and the continental divide has been crossed by at least two more fresh-water fishes in the far north , and two more in northern Mexico . That the fish faunas east and west of the Rockies are so different is obviously owing only partly to the mountain barrier , and partly to habitat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully effective against fresh-water fishes seem to be those of salt water . Moderate gaps of salt water , such as now separate the West Indies from North and South America , Madagascar from Africa , and Celebes from Borneo , may completely stop all strictly fresh-water fishes for a long time . In the very few cases in which supposedly strictly fresh-water species have got across narrow salt-water barriers , there may be doubt about the fishes ' salt tolerances . In general it seems that , excepting salt water , no barriers completely stop the dispersal of fresh-water fishes . What such barriers as zonal climate , deserts , and mountains do is to slow up rates of dispersal and limit or select the numbers and kinds of fishes that disperse . The effect is greatest when two sorts of barriers are combined , as when zonal climatic differences are reinforced by barriers of arid country , but even such combinations do not usually stop dispersal of freshwater fishes completely . A few fishes get across even the compound barriers in the course of time , and the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishes ( e.g. , Cyprinidae ) or fishes with special adaptations and perhaps some salt tolerance ( e.g. , Cyprinodontidae ) . I want now to return to the concept of dominance and its relation to patterns of distribution of fresh-water fishes . Dominant animals are conspicuously successful ones . It will be remembered that Ostariophysi are the dominant fresh-water fishes , far outnumbering all other primary-division fishes together . Cyprinids and their allies are the predominant Ostariophysi . The family Cyprinidae is by far the largest family of fresh-water fishes in numbers of genera and species , and individuals are often very numerous too . Within their area of greatest abundance , cyprinids dominate fresh-water fish faunas to an extent that no other fresh-water fishes do anywhere . Cypriniforms , chiefly the Cyprinidae themselves , rule in the whole of tropical and temperate Eurasia . In China , for example , which includes an area from within the edge of the tropics through much of the width of the north-temperate zone , Nichols ( 1943 ) finds 268 species of Cyprinidae , 83 of other cypriniforms , 65 of fresh-water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus 2 secondary-division cyprinodonts and 73 peripheral fishes ) . In Europe , Berg ( 1932 , p. 174 ) finds 94 species of Cyprinidae , 10 of other cypriniforms , only 2 of fresh-water catfishes , and 13 of non-ostariophysan primary-division fishes ( plus 4 secondarydivision cyprinodonts and 121 peripheral fishes , many of w Lich occur in fresh water only occasionally ) . The family Cyprinidae is fairly diverse in structure , and the cypriniforms as a whole are still more diverse . Structural diversity is not necessarily a criterion of dominance , but it must increase as and if a dominant group radiates . Cyprinids have also very wide tolerances or great powers of adaptation to different fresh-water environments . Cyprinidae are dominant in both the tropics and the north-temperate zone , and in this they are unique . No other family of fresh-water fishes is strikingly successful in both zones . Moreover , cyprinids have entered and crossed inhospitable places that have been barriers to almost all other freshwater fishes and have reached many relatively isolated places within the general limits of distribution of the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only primary-division fishes . This is the case in Spain and southern Italy and in the tern- perate northwestern corner of Africa , in southern Arabia , in parts of western North America ( the catostomids are cypriniforms ) , and perhaps in parts of South Africa . In some of these places cyprinids are accompanied by cyprinodonts , but the latter are secondary-division fishes and as a group are much less numerous and less successful than cyprinids . Cyprinodonts seem to owe their presence in isolated and inhospitable places to special characteristics including perhaps small size and ability to withstand not only saline but possibly alkaline water , while the presence of cyprinids in these places is only one detail of a general dominance . Finally , fossils and other evidence ( see again Figs. 12 and 14 ) suggest that , in temperate Eurasia , spread of cyprinids has been correlated with retreat and disappearance of some other fishes , and it may be guessed that direct competition has occurred and that the cyprinids have had the best of it . Cyprinidae , then , are very numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have wide tolerances ( or are very adaptable ) and are uniquely successful in both tropical and temperate climates and in a great variety of habitats , including relatively unfavorable and isolated ones , so that their distribution is nearly continuous over a great area , in a great range of climate , and across difficult places that have been barriers to most other fresh-water fishes . And cyprinids have apparently competed with and forced withdrawal of some other fishes in some places . All these characteristics go together to make a picture of a very dominant group , with what I have called a radial pattern of distribution . It is among such dominant animals that clues to places of origin and directions of dispersal are most trustworthy , and the clues show that cyprinids and cypriniforms have radiated from a main center in tropical Asia . The whole order Ostariophysi , to which the cypriniforms belong , is dominant , comprising about seven-eighths of all primary-division fresh-water fishes . Ostariophysi are overwhelmingly dominant in tropical and temperate Eurasia ; less so in Africa and North America ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1800 or 2000 known fresh-water Ostariophysi to only five species of non-ostariophysan primary-division fishes ( plus considerable numbers of secondary-division and some peripheral ones ) . The distribution of the whole dominant order Ostariophysi falls into a pattern of apparent radiation from the Old World tropics : the Ostariophysi of the northtemperate zone seem to have come from the Old World tropics , and those of South America are part of an originally very limited and  | probably derived fauna , so that the tropics of the Old World are left as the apparent center of radiation of the order ( Fig. 14 ) . Excepting the cypriniforms and the family Cyprinidae , the separate groups of Ostariophysi do not have obviously radial distributions . The characins and their allies , though numerous in the regions where they occur and very diverse in South America , are confined to Africa and America and are almost confined to the tropics there . The catfishes are worth more detailed consideration . Catfishes are numerous , diverse , and widely distributed ( Fig. 16 ) . However , they nowhere dominate fish faunas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous only in the tropics . ( Even the marine families are chiefly tropical . ) In the north-temperate zone , there are fair numbers of them ( but nothing like a tropical diversity ) only in China and eastern North America . There are few of them in southwestern Asia , only two localized species in Europe , none across northern Asia above the latitude of the Amur River and none anywhere in or very near the arctic , none native in most of western North America , and none in some smaller areas where  | cyprinids occur ( e.g. , the northwestern corner of Africa and part of Arabia ) . Catfishes are therefore not only fewer but also less evenly and less continuously distributed than cyprinids in the north-temperate zone . Besides not going so far north as cyprinids , catfishes do not go quite so far south in Africa , but they go farther south than any other true fresh-water fishes in South America , where catfishes attain their greatest dominance , and where they are almost unbelievably varied in structure and adaptation . The interrelationships of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution and dispersal can only be guessed at . If the Ostariophysi originated in the Old World tropics , catfishes probably began there , but they must have reached South America long ago . If the ancestors of the South American catfishes came through , the north , they have disappeared there , which is reasonable enough . Present distributions suggest that several later groups of catfishes have extended from tropical Asia into the north but have not done well there . The ancestors of the Ameiuridae may have moved from tropical into temperate Asia and then to North America . If so , they later died out in Asia and western North America . The Ameiuridae are supposed to be related to Old World forms , and the family is doubtfully fossil in eastern Asia ; there is still more doubtful evidence ( a painting ) of a supposed existing species in China . The Siluridae have perhaps extended more recently from the tropical Orient into northern Asia and Europe . They may now be retreating in Europe , for the two existing European species are isolated and probably relict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bagridae , which reach the Amur , and the Sisoridae , which reach central Asia , are presumably still more recent invaders , whose fate is not yet indicated . The catfishes as a whole might be said to have a pattern of distribution that is partly zonal and partly radial . They are primarily tropical , but several groups of them have made minor radiations into the northtemperate zone , from tropical Asia . Of other fresh-water fishes , the labyrinth fishes come nearest a pattern of radial distribution . They are most numerous and diverse in tropical Asia . Two of the Asiatic genera , Anabas and Ophicephalus , extend to Africa , and the same two genera extend north in eastern Asia , reaching southern Manchuria and the Amur River respectively . However , labyrinth fishes seem to be absent in western Asia and northern Africa , and this discontinuity suggests that the main ( moderate ) radiation of these fishes is over and that they are beginning to retreat .   Dominance and the radial patterns of distribution which are in some cases connected with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is very important in zoogeography that some groups of animals are more successful than others , at least at certain times and in certain parts of the world , and that the more successful groups sometimes have special patterns of distribution which override the climatic zones and most kinds of barriers . This fact is as well exemplified by fresh-water fishes , especially by the Cyprinidae , as by any animals . Dominance is relative , and it implies competition . There are various evidences that fishes do compete with each other . Introduction by man of certain fishes into certain waters sometimes causes reduction or elimination of other fishes . A similar elimination of some fishes by others evidently occurs naturally . The presence of the Pike reduces the numbers of some other fishes in some waters , and the presence of  | suckers reduces the numbers of trout . The full extent of this sort of thing in nature can only be deduced indirectly . The apparent history of fresh-water fishes in temperate Eurasia , where cyprinids have spread and some other fishes apparently retreated , suggests competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishes over the world ( Fig. 17 ) , especially the general complementarity of cypriniforms and other fishes , suggest competition on the broadest lines . It looks as if the main pattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes is partly a result of competition among great groups of fishes in great areas during long periods of time . The competition has probably been very complex in detail and has probably involved longterm adaptability as well as short-term adaptations . The qualities and adaptations that make some fresh-water fishes dominant ? more successful than others over great areas and in diverse habitats ? are not easy to ascertain . All Ostariophysi possess the Weberian apparatus ( p. 42 ) which may sharpen hearing and may account for the order being dominant in fresh water but not in the sea . At least this is a plausible explanation , whether or not it is correct . I know no such simple explanation of the dominance of cyprinids among Ostariophysi . The moderate dominance of the labyrinth fishes may or may not be due partly to their possession of a supplementary air-breathing organ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cyprinids , some catfishes , and labyrinth fishes is a separate question . I shall try to answer it later . Starting with the fact that fishes occur in almost all fresh waters over the world , the broadest pattern of their distribution is one of limitation and partial complementarity . Strictly fresh-water , primary division fishes are almost limited to the continents and recent continental islands , excepting Australia . Somewhat salt-tolerant , secondary-division fishes tend to complement the strictly fresh-water ones on islands which are not too remote and in other places , notably Central America , which have been hard for strictly fresh-water fishes to reach . And very salt-tolerant , peripheral fishes , although they occur almost everywhere , are relatively abundant in the far north and far south and on Australia and remote islands where strictly freshwater fishes and even secondary-division ones are few or absent . Within their limits , strictly fresh-water fishes form several other broad patterns . The non-ostariophysans tend to be zoned : most fam- ilies of them follow one or the other of the two main climatic zones around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peripheral fishes and some marine ones are zoned too . The Ostariophysi tend to be radial rather than zonal in distribution : the cypriniforms follow continuities of land from a main center in southeastern Asia , and the whole order Ostariophysi fits into an apparent pattern of radiation from the Old World tropics . However , the zonal and radial patterns are connected by intermediate , apparently transitional cases . Another broad pattern of fresh-water fish distribution is differentiation of faunas on different continents . The fauna of Africa is a complex mixture of archaic fishes and higher ones , but with relatively few cypriniforms . That of tropical Asia lacks all archaic fishes but is very rich in cypriniforms and fairly rich in higher , spiny-rayed groups , especially labyrinth fishes . That of temperate Eurasia is dominated by cypriniforms . That of North America is fairly diverse ; it includes two families of cypriniforms , but they do not dominate the fauna as they do in temperate Eurasia . That of South America is basically limited and entirely lacks cypriniform but is richest of all in endemic groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly freshwater fishes . These differences fall into one main pattern : there is a central area of cyprinid dominance in tropical and temperate Eurasia ; next , mixed faunas , including some cypriniforms , on the adjacent continents of Africa and North America ; and finally , highly endemic faunas , without cypriniforms , on the more isolated continents of South America and Australia . Figure 17 shows this pattern gral hically . In spite of the great differences in their composition , the freshwater fish faunas of the different continents have a common internal pattern of distribution . The main part of each fauna is concentrated in the largest rivers and largest favorable areas , and progressive subtractions from it occur in smaller rivers and smaller and less favorable , outlying areas . This pattern is strongly marked in Africa , in Eurasia as a whole , in North America , and in South America . The main fish faunas of adjacent , connected continents are usually separated from each other by unfavorable areas in which comparatively few fishes occur . However , some members of each fauna usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming transitions in which there is progressive subtraction from each fauna , in opposite directions . To put all this still more briefly , the main pattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes consists of at least five subpatterns . They are  | ( 1 ) geographical limitation of strictly fresh-water fishes , and partial complementarity with salt-tolerant ones ; ( 2 ) zonation ; ( 3 ) radiation ; ( 4 ) differentiation of continental faunas within a world-wide pattern in which complementarity of dominant groups is conspicuous ; and ( 5 ) concentration of each main fauna in a large and favorable area , with subtraction marginally , but with the fringes of adjacent faunas overlapping across most kinds of barriers . These subpatterns are related among themselves . The broadest limitation and complementarity contain or involve the other patterns . Complementarity is partly zonal and is involved in differentiation of continental faunas . Zonation and radiation are connected , and both contribute to the differentiation of continental faunas . And the concentration of main faunas in large and favorable areas , with subtraction marginally , strengthens other patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , but that is unavoidable . Animal distribution is complex . Within this main pattern are an infinite number of local patterns made by local climates , local barriers , local changes in drainages , and local evolutions and extinctions of different fishes . A few of these local patterns have been noted , but most are of necessity beyond the scope of this book . The place of relicts in the pattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes must be stated for later reference . There are no ancient relicts of cyclostomes or shark-like fishes in fresh water . Existing freshwater members of these classes appear to have come rather recently from the sea . Of bony fishes , all the non-teleosts are phylogenetic relicts . They are few . In the primary division of fresh-water fishes are only the bichirs , with two genera , thirteen species , in Africa ; paddlefishes , with one genus and species in China and another genus , one or two species in east-central North America ; the Bowfin ( Amia Galva ) in eastern North America ; lepidosirenid lungfishes , with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one species in South America ; and ceratodontid lungfishes , with one species localized in Australia . In the secondary division is only the family Lepisosteidae , with one genus , four or five species in eastern North America , Central America , and Cuba . Of these fishes , only the Australian lungfish is geographically isolated , and it is the only one that is strikingly restricted in present distribution . All the others live with great faunas of true fresh-water fishes , some in the full tropics , some in the northtemperate zone , and all are more or less widely distributed within the regions in which they occur ( see list of fish families for details ) . Of all the main regions in which faunas of true fresh-water fishes  | occur , only tropical Asia lacks relict non-teleosts . Some of the relicts , notably the lungfishes , may be protected from competition with most other fishes by special adaptations and modes of life , but others are not . Amia calva , for example , although the only relict of an order which dominated Jurassic seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north-temperate zone , exists in open and successful competition with other large , predaceous fishes in the present , rich fresh-water fish fauna of eastern North America . These facts do not agree well with the idea , current among biologists , that phylogenetic relicts usually occur in isolated or protected places . How has the pattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes been formed ? The pattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes seems to have been formed mainly by movement of the fishes themselves , by a complex process of evolution , dispersal , limitation , retreat , and extinction over the available parts of a complex world . There is plain evidence , in patterns of distribution and occurrence of fossils , that some groups of fishes have spread very extensively in geologically recent times and that others have retreated extensively . Another indication of motion is that adjacent fish faunas usually are not sharply separated but overlap at the edges in a way suggesting movement in opposite directions of some members of each fauna , so that the pattern of fish distribution is blurred like that of a moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzle . The most important recent event in the dispersal of fresh-water fishes seems to have been the rise of cypriniforms in southeastern Asia and their radiation from there , accompanied by wildrawal of various other fishes from large parts of Eurasia . An even more important , earlier event was the rise of the Ostariophysi as a whole in fresh water and their radiation probably from the Old World tropics . These two events , imposed on a pattern otherwise primarily zonal , seem to have formed the most significant features of the present pattern . I have just answered tentatively , for fresh-water fishes only , two of the four questions asked at the beginning of the preface : what is the main pattern of distribution ? ; how has the pattern been formed ? Now , for later reference and to introduce some important principles , I shall give tentative answers , still for fishes only , to the other questions : why has the pattern been formed ? ; what does it tell about ancient lands and climates ? Why has the pattern been formed ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the world , by complex inter- action of the two . This is self-evident , but the details are not all easy to understand . What is there about fishes and about the world that accounts for the five observed subpatterns of fresh-water fish distribution ? The virtual limitation of primary-division fishes to continental areas is due to the lack of salt tolerance of these fishes and to the position of old barriers of salt water . That some fresh-water fishes are limited by salt water is not surprising . It is much more surprising that so many other fishes can tolerate presence or absence of salt . That some groups of fishes can do this , and have thus been able to spread beyond the limits of the strictly fresh-water groups and to reach and evolve in fresh water on isolated lands , has produced the broad pattern of partial complementarity of strictly fresh-water and salt-tolerant forms . The zonal subpattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes has been formed because whole groups of the fishes have become adapted to single climates , tropical , temperate , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of climate itself is shown by the many peripheral and marine fishes that are zoned too . The zonation of strictly fresh-water fishes is accentuated by barriers , for the tropical and north-temperate zones of the land happen to be separated in most places by areas of arid country and in some places also by mountains or other obstacles to dispersal of fishes . Such barriers are absent only in eastern Asia . Judging by what happens there , it may be guessed that , in the absence of barriers , many fresh-water fishes would still be zoned but that there would not be sharp lines between the zonal faunas . The radial subpattern of fresh-water fish distribution has been formed because certain dominant groups of fishes have evolved in certain places , especially in tropical Asia , and have spread from there in whatever directions continuity of land has allowed , with relatively little regard for climatic zones or for most kinds of barriers , except salt water . Differentiation of continental fish faunas has been due to the very complex factors which have caused spreading or receding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different continents . The main pattern of differentiation ? of cyprinid dominance in Eurasia , mixed dominance on adjacent continents , and absence of cyprinids on more remote continents ? is due to whatever causes led to the rise of cyprinids in southeastern Asia . Finally , concentration of main fish faunas in large , favorable areas  | suggests a connection between extent of favorable area and size and nature of faunas . This is the first hint of what will prove to be a very important principle of animal distribution . In summary , it might be said that the broadest pattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes has been determined by three things : old barriers of salt water , zonation of climate , and the nature and evolution of the fishes themselves , with area playing an as yet undetermined role . What does the pattern tell about ancient lands and climates ? North of the tropics , fossils and the general distribution of living fishes show that there has been a distinct fresh-water fish fauna around the world in the north-temperate zone since early in the Tertiary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have existed at least since the early Tertiary . And it shows that Eurasia and North America were connected in the Tertiary and that the connection was warm enough to allow exchange of many temperate-zone fishes . Finer details of the distribution of fishes tell many things about changes of climate and of drainage systems in the Pleistocene . At this time Asia and North America were still or again connected , across Bering Strait , but the connection was cold . It was crossed by arctic fishes but not by more southern ones . South of the tropics , in the south-temperate zone , the distribution of fresh-water fishes tells of no great changes in the world . The primary-division fishes of South Africa and southern South America have evidently come southward from the tropics independently on the two continents . There are no primary-division fishes in southern Australia . So , no primary-division fishes show relationships between the southern extremities of the continents . The galaxiids and other peripheral fishes that do occur around the southern hemisphere have , I think , dispersed by sea , although some persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within the tropics , fresh-water fishes have a pattern of distribution so clear and significant that the fishes may well tell more about the histories of the continents than do any other living animals . Fresh-water fishes suggest no great changes in the relation of the Old World continents to each other . The fish faunas of Africa and tropical Asia are very different as wholes , but share about ten primary-division families and even a few genera . These two faunas are fairly effectively separated now and they seem to have been so for a long time , except for occasional exchange of a few fishes across southwestern Asia . A few fishes ,  | especially some cyprinids , have been exchanged by this route recently . That earlier exchanges , too , were across southwestern Asia and not across a more direct land connection is indicated by the complete absence of strictly fresh-water fishes on Madagascar . The differences between the fish faunas of Africa and Asia suggest a profound difference in the histories of the two continents . The fauna of Africa is a complex mixture of archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Asia . That of tropical Asia consists mostly of more recent fishes of groups which seem to have originated and radiated in tropical Asia . The history of Africa seems to have favored survival of old fishes ; of tropical Asia , evolution of new ones . The finer details of distribution of fresh-water fishes in these parts of the world tell many things about the histories of rivers and lakes , but this can not be gone into at length here . Flora ( several papers ) has published interesting material on the histories of the fresh-water fishes and rivers of India ; and Beaufort ( 1951 , pp. 76 ? 79 , 80ff. , maps on pp. 86 , 104 ? 109 ) has recently discussed from this point of view the histories of some of the lakes and rivers of India , the Greater Sunda Islands , and Africa . Fresh-water fishes show no great change in the relation of Australia to other continents . The Australian osteoglossid probably came from Asia , and the Australian lungfish may have come from that direction as well as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former land connection , although the lungfish suggests one . Before concluding this discussion of what fresh-water fishes tell of ancient lands and climates , I want to consider the origin of the South American fish fauna . Origin of South American fresh-water fishes ( a digression ) . South America has a fish fauna which raises greater difficulties . If we knew how fresh-water fishes reached South America , we would know much about the histories of all the continents since the Cretaceous . We do not know , but we can make some careful guesses , and they are well worth making . It is best to begin by getting firmly in mind the position of South America on the globe and its relation to other continents ( see Frontispiece ) . South America has the largest of all fresh-water fish faunas , but it is derived from few ancestors . South American primary- and secondarydivision fishes belong to only seven basic groups ( Table 2 ) . All seven basic groups are represented also in Africa , but only part of them in Asia . Asia does have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no lepidosirenids , no characins , only one genus of   cichlids , which apparently reached southern India rather recently from Africa , and only a few cyprinodonts , which are apparently not directly related to South American ones . Moreover , there seem to be no direct relationships between South American fresh-water fishes and existing , truly North American groups except in the salt-tolerant Cyprinodontes . The whole of the South American fresh-water fish fauna is primarily African in its relationships . The relationships are old . Only four primary- and two secondary-division families are now the same in Africa and South America , and no genus is the same . A further , important fact is that , although all the main groups of true fresh-water fishes in South America are represented in Africa , there are additional groups in Africa which are not represented in South America . This statement of the case is too simple , and some details of it may be questioned , but it is essentially true . The case has been stated somewhat differently and in more detail by Myers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South American to African fishes was well known to earlier authors including Eigenmann ( 1909 , especially pp. 363ff . ) . The unbalance of the South American fresh-water fish fauna goes beyond the fewness of its ancestors . The fauna is overwhelmingly dominated by Ostariophysi , which number something like 1800 or more known species in South America , a little less than half being characins and gymnotid eels , and more than half catfishes ( but the characins are said to surpass the catfishes in number of individuals ) . The three other groups of primary-division fishes iu South America  | total only five known species there . This , of course , does not include the cyprinodonts and cichlids , which are present in fair numbers but which , because of the known salt tolerance of some of them , are less important zoogeographically . A noteworthy detail is that the three families of non-ostariophysan primary-division fishes in South America differ extraordinarily among themselves . The lungfish is a primitive non-teleost , and is a large fish adapted to seasonally fluctuating water . The two osteoglossids are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large fishes which must live in large and permanent bodies of water . And the two nandids are higher , spiny-rayed teleosts , and are small and can live in small bodies of water . These differences in evolutionary level and in ecological requirements must be taken into account in considering how the fishes reached South America . The limitation and unbalance of the South American fresh-water fish fauna suggest that it is a derived one , descended from a few immigrants which somehow reached South America from Africa , or from a fauna like that which as a whole is now confined to Africa . In South America , the Ostariophysi , both catfishes and characins , have radiated in isolation , like the cichlids in African lakes , or the cichlids and cyprinodonts in Central America , or some other fresh-water fishes elsewhere , but on a much larger scale . The fewness of ancestors and extent of radiation suggest that the fishes reached South America with difficulty . How they did so is the question . The Ostariophysi are , I think , the key to the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of their numbers in South America , because ( excepting two families of catfishes ) they are as strictly confined to fresh water as any fishes , because they are dominant fishes over most of the world , and because for this reason clues to their history are likely to be relatively clear and dependable . However , it should be remembered that even Ostariophysi vary in dominance , and that some of them have retreated from some places . Fresh-water fishes ? Ostariophysi ? might conceivably have reached South America in several different ways . They might have come through the sea , if they had enough salt tolerance in ancient times , or across a direct land connection from Africa which no longer exists , or by way of existing northern continents where the fishes no longer exist . The choice among these possibilities , if one can be made , must be made chiefly by clues from existing distributions , for the fishes concerned have not left a good fossil record . Characins and fresh-water catfishes might have reached South America through the sea if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early fresh-water forms were salt tolerant . An actual origin in the sea is unlikely . Ostariophysi seem primarily adapted to fresh water and probably originated in it . Dispersal by sea of salt-tolerant members of early fresh-water groups is possible but not probable . If these fishes could cross even moderate widths of sea , they should be in Madagascar and perhaps Australia and other isolated places , but they are not , except ariid and plotosid catfishes , which are secondarily able to live in the sea . The complete absence of other Ostariophysi in remote places is significant , for these fishes are dominant and adaptable and should survive in fresh water on any reasonably large , stable , isolated land that they have ever been able to reach , A further argument against marine dispersal of these fishes is the presence in South America of other fresh-water animals , including certain mollusks and frogs , which show the same African relationships as the fishes but can hardly have dispersed by sea . That salt-tolerant cichlids and cyprinodonts may have reached South America from Africa through the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not Australia . As to a direct connection , the possibility that Africa and South America were formerly in contact and have drifted apart has long intrigued students of fish distribution . At first sight the facts seem consistent with this possibility . All the true fresh-water fishes of South America seem to have old relationships toward Africa , and fresh-water fishes are just the animals which ought to preserve old geographical relationships . But a closer look changes the picture . South American fresh-water fishes do not represent the whole African fish fauna or any simple part of it . Particularly they do not represent the old part for , although a lungfish is present in South America , the ancient polypterids are not , and most of the presumably old African groups of Isospondyli are absent in South America too ( Fig. 12 ) . South American fresh-water fishes represent a fraction of the African fish fauna which is extraordinarily mixed in its evolutionary levels and ecological requirements , as has already been pointed out . This is not what would be expected from continental drift but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with difficulty , perhaps in different ways or at different times . Moreover , theories of continental drift usually involve all the continents , not just South America and Africa , and nowhere else in the world does the distribution of strictly fresh-water fishes suggest drift . The absence of primary division fishes on Madagascar is a notable fact inconsistent with the usual drift theory . It seems to me ( but some zoogeographers dis- agree ) that the distribution of existing groups of fresh-water fishes over the world shows no evidence of drift . There is a moral here . The relationships of South American freshwater fishes are almost wholly African . Superficially this fact suggests continental drift . But better understanding of the situation changes its significance . The moral is obvious . The possibility that fresh-water fishes reached South America across a long land bridge from Africa might be dismissed with the comment that fresh-water fishes are about the last sort of animals to get across a land bridge . They are . But they do cross land bridges , and fortunately a bridge now exists which shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge connects South and North America . It is , from the beginning of the Isthmus of Panama to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec , about 1300 miles long , or about two-thirds as long as a hypothetical bridge from Africa to South America . Moreover , the existing American bridge is rather narrow , mountainous , and unstable and was broken during most of the Tertiary . The present complete connection was established late in the Pliocene , only a few million years ago . The present distribution of fresh-water fishes on this bridge has been described under " Fresh-water fishes of Central America " ( pp. 72ff . ) . The whole length of the bridge has been crossed by one genus of characins and one of fresh-water catfishes . A few other Ostariophysi have got part of the way across it . But no strictly freshwater non-ostariophysans have even begun to cross it . Of salt-tolerant fishes , however , several cyprinodonts and one genus of cichlids have crossed the whole bridge , and gar pikes have got about halfway across . The fishes that have crossed or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant Ostariophysi , extremely few considering the numbers of them in North and South America , and a few salt-tolerant fishes . The latter differ very much among themselves , except for their salt tolerance . The gar pikes are primitive non-teleosts and are very large fishes . The cyprinodonts are teleosts , not Isospondyli but still below the evolutionary level of the spiny-rayed families , and are small fishes which can live in small and sometimes seasonal waters . And the cichlids are spiny-rayed , and of moderate size and more or less ordinary requirements . These fishes have filtered across a land bridge , and they make up a fauna which as a whole ( although some of the groups are different ) is very much like the one from which the South American fauna seems to have been derived : a few dominant Ostario- physi plus a few other fishes extraordinarily mixed in their evolutionary levels and ecological requirements . Derivation from Africa across a direct land bridge narrow and difficult enough to have had a strong selective or filtering effect , permitting passage of only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by radiation of the dominant Ostariophysi , accounts very well for the South American fresh-water fish fauna ? if the lungfish , osteoglossids , and nandids as well as cyprinodonts and cichlids were slightly salt tolerant . But there is still another way in which fresh-water fishes may have reached South America , and the existence of a reasonable alternative makes it necessary to withhold judgment on the direct bridge . Perhaps the evidence of other animals will decide which explanation is correct . Strictly freshwater fishes are about the last sort of animals to get across a bridge . If they get across at all , other animals should get across faster and in greater number and should show beyond question that the bridge existed . This is obvious , and it is what did happen in Central America . The remaining possibility is that fresh-water fishes ? Ostariophysireached South . America through the north , over existing continents where the fishes no longer exist . This might have happened either if the fishes originated in the north and invaded the tropics of the Old and New Worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved through the north to South America . These two possibilities are alike in requiring little change of land , but the evolutionary implications and dispersal patterns are different , and so is the expected fossil record . If the fishes rose to dominance in the north , they should have left an extensive fossil record there , but if they merely filtered through the edges of northern lands , the record might be scanty . Matthew , in Climate and Evolution ( 1915 , pp. 297 ? 299 ; 1939 , pp. 127-130 ) , tried to apply his thesis of northern origins to fresh-water fishes , but the fishes do not fit the thesis . Matthew 's statement of the supposed evidence of fossil fishes is almost wholly a list of errors , as Myers ( 1938 , pp. 351-352 , with footnote 18 ) has shown . There is hardly a fish fossil that really supports Matthew 's ideas . Among existing fresh-water fishes , northern groups have not pushed into the tropics ; on the contrary , tropical groups seem to have pushed northward . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relationships to be expected of relicts , but a definite pattern of evolution and dispersal within the tropics . The pattern , of course , is one of survival of old fishes in Africa , evolution and radiation  | of new dominant groups in tropical Asia , and original limitation followed by independent radiation in South America . The facts just given as arguments against a northern origin of tropical fresh-water fishes are much more consistent with a filtering of them through the north . I have discussed this elsewhere ( 1948 , pp. 13-15 ) , but the subject requires rediscussion along somewhat different lines . If tropical fresh-water fishes filtered through the north under anything like existing conditions , they presumably went by way of eastern Asia , a Bering bridge , North America , and a Central American bridge to South America . It is therefore important to find whether this route has been used by fishes recently . Parts of it have . Some tropical fishes have started along the route . Labyrinth fishes , for example , have radiated ( moderately ) in tropical Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old World tropics , and two widely distributed tropical genera have pushed north in eastern Asia to southern Manchuria and the Amur region , although labyrinth fishes are otherwise absent in the north-temperate zone . These fishes have not reached North America , but they might do so if the climate were a little milder and if land were continuous across Bering Strait . Cyprinids have followed the route much farther , probably beginning in tropical Asia , spreading through temperate Eurasia and North America , and re-entering the edge of the tropics in southern Mexico ; but they can hardly be said to have filtered through the north , for they are dominant there as well as in the Old World tropics . This , however , is a special case ; cyprinids are the only fresh-water fishes conspicuously successful both in tropical and in northern climates . The catfishes and characins that reached South America long ago may have begun like the labyrinth fishes and then passed through North America as the cyprinids have done , but without becoming numerous in the north . This is consistent with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some existing groups of them extend into the north-temperate zone , but they apparently do not usually do well there ( see p. 82 ) and may not survive there long . Earlier catfishes may have extended into the north-temperate zone long enough to pass through it to South America without leaving much record of their passage . Characins are now confined to Africa and America and are nearly confined to the tropics there . They do not occur in tropical Asia and are not known fossil there . However , cypriniforms are supposed to  | be derived from characins , and the origin and eventual dominance of cypriniforms in tropical Asia implies the former presence of characins there and accounts for their disappearance . Characins were apparently in tropical Asia once , and they may have extended northward in eastern Asia and through North America to South America , as catfishes may have done . These fishes may have passed right through an old north-temperate fish fauna , just as the three existing groups of North American Ostariophysi have done more recently ( p. 76 ) . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the north , if catfishes and characins did so , or they may have come in some other way , perhaps at least partly through the sea , either directly from Africa or along indirect coast lines . They are comparatively unimportant and are not worth further discussion now . If Old World tropical fishes reached South America through eastern Asia and North America , they came not from a primarily African fauna but from a fauna which was once common to Africa and tropical Asia , which has survived more or less entire in Africa , but which has been largely replaced in Asia by evolution of later dominant fishes . This pattern ? of survival in Africa and evolution of new , dominant groups in Asia ? is the pattern of distribution of fresh-water fishes in the Old World tropics . All this seems to me to make the derivation of South American fresh-water fishes through the north reasonably likely . The route followed need not have been the exact one described , but any route consistent with the state of Eurasia and North America when the fishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for South America became isolated from all other continents about the beginning of the Tertiary . The record of the Ostariophysi and of most other fresh-water fishes in the Cretaceous is virtually blank over the whole world . The absence of Cretaceous fossil characins etc. in the north is , therefore , only one detail of a general absence of any record of these fishes at that time . The absence of a pertinent fossil record allows and even forces us to try to reconstruct the history of the fishes by other means , as I have done . Of the various ways in which fresh-water fishes might have reached South America ? from or through the sea , or by direct contact of Africa and South America or a direct land bridge , or from or through the north ? only two seem likely for the strictly fresh-water forms . One is by direct but narrow bridge ( not broad contact ) from Africa ; the other , through ( not from ) the north-temperate zone . Both routes  | might be thought of as filter bridges , the filtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing a narrow land bridge , and in the second by cool or seasonal climate high above the tropics ( see Frontispiece ) . In either case , it must be supposed that certain things have happened since the fishes reached South America . In the first case a long bridge of land must have disappeared into the Atlantic . In the second , certain groups of fishes must have disappeared from at least parts of the north-temperate zone ; and some change of land must be supposed in this case too , at least the existence and later interruption of a probably late Cretaceous land connection between North and South America . So far as the fishes alone are concerned , I see no way to decide between these two possibilities now . What does the pattern tell about ancient lands and climates ( conclusion ) ? The distribution of fresh-water fishes seems to tell of a world not very different in the past from now , with no great changes in the arrangement of climatic zones or of continents , but with the north-temperate zone warmer in the Tertiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections in the north , at least across Bering Strait , in the Tertiary and Pleistocene , and with a land bridge connecting South America with either Africa or North America in the Cretaceous . It tells of no close union of Africa and South America , nor does it tell of continental drift anywhere within the time of the fishes concerned , but their time may have been only since the late Cretaceous . The fishes also tell something of the history of different continents . They suggest that Africa has been relatively stable , that southern Asia has been unstable or has somehow favored the evolution of new dominant groups of fresh-water fishes , that South America was both well watered and isolated for a long time after existing freshwater fishes reached it , and that Australia has been more isolated for a longer time . After the preceding pages had been written and rewritten several times , it struck me that the apparent history of the Ostariophysi fitted with the history of the Tethys Sea . From the Mesozoic into the Tertiary the Tethys Sea , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragment , stretched across the whole of southern Europe and Asia to the East Indies . It was not a stable sea . It lay in a geosyncline in which spectacular mountain building was going on , mountain building which eventually , in the Tertiary , produced the Alps and Himalayas . The region was evidently constantly changing , with changing shore lines , changing barriers and bridges , changing archipelagos , and presumably an immense , changing front- age between salt- and fresh-water habitats . This may well have been the place where , in the Cretaceous , the ancestor of the Ostariophysi entered fresh water , and where characins and early catfishes rose to dominance . And the eastern ( southern Asiatic ) part of the Tethys region , where favorable conditions may have been more widespread or may have lasted longer , was apparently the place where , perhaps about the beginning of the Tertiary , characins were converted into cypriniforms and the place from which the latter radiated . I assume the existence , in the Cretaceous , of a variety of non-ostariophysan fresh-water families , independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some in the Old World tropics and some in the north-temperate zone . ( Some of the non-ostariophysans may have entered fresh water later , but they can not be distinguished here . ) During the Cretaceous , Ostariophysi originated in fresh water , probably in the Old World tropics and very likely in the Tethys region , and  | split into characins and catfishes . And part , but only part , of the resultant Old World tropical fauna of non-ostariophysan fishes plus primitive Ostariophysi ( characins and catfishes ) reached South America , either from Africa along a direct land bridge or from tropical Asia by way of North America . Later , about the beginning of the Tertiary , catostomids evolved , supposedly from characins in southeastern Asia ( the eastern Tethys region ) , and they and ancestral ameiurid catfishes spread through eastern Asia to North America . Then cyprinids evolved in turn , apparently from catostomids , radiated explosively in southeastern Asia , flooded the whole of Eurasia , and reached Africa and North America . At the same time some higher , spiny-rayed groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesser degree , reaching Africa and temperate eastern Asia but not beyond . The newly dominant fishes , especially the cyprinids , replaced many older fishes . In tropical Asia they replaced characins , cichlids , and most old freshwater families ; and in temperate Eurasia they replaced most catostomids and several non-ostariophysan families , notably ( in eastern Asia ) percids . The destruction of older fishes in both tropical and temperate Eurasia , and also in western North America and Central America , was furthered by various geological and climatic changes , so that the old tropical fresh-water fish fauna of the Cretaceous survived as a whole only in Africa , and in a partial and derivative form in South America . Of course this is just the simplest outline of the main events of a history which must have been ( if it occurred ) very complex . This discussion of fresh-water fishes has been long and complicated , and I want to end it by emphasizing certain important things . It is important that many fishes have zonal distributions , limited by climate . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate but have radial distributions which override the climatic zones and most other barriers . It looks as if dominant fishes may first radiate with little regard for climate and become zoned later . The most dominant existing fresh-water fishes seem to have radiated from the Old World tropics ; the north-temperate zone may have acted as a filter bridge for the passage of some of them to South America . A relation between size of rivers and number and diversity of fishes has been noticed . That there are the most fishes where there is the most space for them may seem too obvious to emphasize , but the effects of space ( area ) will turn out to be neither simple nor obvious but very important .  | The late Dr. Thomas Barbour , Mr. Arthur Loveridge , and Mr. Benjamin Shreve have answered many questions of mine about existing amphibians . Professor Alfred S. Romer has helped me with ancient ones . Dr. Karl P. Schmidt and Professor E. R. Dunn have read an early stage of the manuscript of this chapter and made useful comments on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paulo Vanzolini in conversation have contributed many additional facts and ideas . I am deeply indebted to all of these persons . Romer ( 1945 , modified 1947 ) recognizes ten orders of amphibians . Seven of them , with about forty families , contain only long-extinct forms . Some of the latter were important in their time . They were the first land vertebrates and were dominant before the Age of Reptiles . The three existing orders of amphibians are the Anura ( frogs and toads ) , Urodela ( salamanders ) , and Apoda ( caecilians ) . These orders are very distinct from each other and all are probably old . Probable ancestors of the Anura occur before the Mesozoic , in the Pennsylvanian ( Romer 1947 , p. 259 ) , and Anura themselves are known in the Jurassic . Of salamanders , the earliest known fossil is in the Lower Cretaceous ; there is no record of them back through the Jurassic and Triassic ; but they are apparently derived from still earlier , pre-Mesozoic lepospondyls ( Romer 1945 , p. 111 ) . No fossils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this order too is probably derived , independently , from pre-Mesozoic lepospondyls ( Romer ) . The classification of families and genera of existing amphibians is not very satisfactory . The salamanders are in best order . The caecilians are simplified , legless , burrowing forms known to few people and poorly understood taxonomically . Frogs and toads are better known , but they have no external characters of much phylogenetic importance , and there has been parallelism in the evolution and adaptations of different groups , even in the evolution of the skeleton ( Parker 1932 ) . Because of this , the real relationships of some frogs and toads are still doubtful . I am not competent to decide the doubts , so I have used the last detailed classification of living amphibians ( Noble 1931 ) with only a few changes , chiefly Parker 's ( 1934 , 1940 ) . The more important doubtful points are mentioned in the proper places below . I have been familiar with the terms Anura , Urodela , Apoda , and also Salientia ( a term meaning approximately the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pause to identify these words when I meet them . They are confusing words and I intend to avoid them . But that raises a minor difficulty : there is no inclusive , common English word for Anura , for frogs and toads together . I shall get around this difficulty by using " frogs " in a broad sense , to include toads too . This is a natural extension of meaning , for toads are not a taxonomic unit but merely frogs with thickened and warty skin . Amphibians are , of course , cold-blooded . Typical frogs and salamanders and also some caecilians are amphibious , with aquatic larvae ( tadpoles ) and terrestrial adults . In each order , however , certain forms have become entirely aquatic through their whole lives , and others entirely terrestrial . In the latter the larval stage is omitted , or passed on land in the egg capsule , or carried by the adults , so that the animals spend their whole lives out of water . Frogs particularly have diverse adaptations for this ( Barbour 1926 ) , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the Seychelles and New Zealand . There is , in the living orders of amphibians , a correlation between numbers , taxonomic and ecological diversity , and extent and diversity of area occupied . Caecilians form one family of some 17 genera and 73 known species . They are all burrowing or aquatic as adults . And they are confined almost entirely to the wet tropics of Africa , the Oriental Region , and America . Living salamanders form $ families ,  | some 43 or more genera , and about 200 full species . Most of them are terrestrial or aquatic ( in surface water ) as adults , but a few occur in subterranean water and a few are arboreal . And they are mostly confined to the wet parts of the north-temperate zone ; a few have entered the tropics ; but no salamander occurs in the southtemperate zone . Frogs , including toads , form about 37 families and subfamilies , about 200 or more genera , and perhaps 2000 or more known species . They include a variety not only of amphibious , aquatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different land habitats , but also many arboreal ones independently derived from several different families . And they are very widely distributed in both main climatic zones , occur in arid and other unfavorable places as well as favorable ones , and range farther north , farther south , and much farther onto islands than caecilians and salamanders do . Amphibians have scant tolerance for salt water . The frog Rana cancrivora and related species in the Orient live near the sea coast and by brackish estuaries ; the adults enter sea water for short times apparently with impunity ; and the tadpoles have been found living in salt water in crab holes even below high-tide line ( Boulenger 1903 , Pearse 1911 , M. Smith 1927 ) . There are some other records of salamanders and frogs being found in salt water , probably by accident but alive , and living more or less normally in brackish water ( Schmidt 1951 ) . Many persons including Darwin ( 1859 ; 1950 reprint , p. 333 ) have thought that contact with salt water must be immediately fatal to all amphibians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again Schmidt 1951 ) . Some amphibians , at least some frogs , can stand an occasional dip in the sea or contact with salt spray , and this must improve their chances of being rafted across narrow ocean straits . The actual tolerances for salt water of different amphibians under different conditions are almost entirely unknown and are well worth investigation . But simple experiments to this end will not be final . Whether or not amphibians have crossed salt water is more likely to be shown by their distributions than by anything that can be learned in the laboratory , and their distributions , compared with those of fresh-water fishes , show beyond reasonable doubt that frogs have crossed moderate gaps of salt water many times . Amphibians have scant tolerance for desiccation . They vary somewhat in this . Thorson and Svihla ( 1943 ) found that Scaphiopus ( spadefoot toads ) could stand to lose more water than Bu f o ( ordinary toads ) , which could lose more than Hyla ( tree frogs ) , which could lose more than Rana ( ordinary frogs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These experiments were made with only a few species , and the authors wisely do not try to extend the results . For here again there is a great difference between the adaptations and tolerances of the animals experimented with and the adaptability and occurrence of the groups in nature . Not only Scaphiopus and Bufo but also Rana and its derivatives sometimes occur in deserts ( see text , p. 147 ) , and even Hyla does so sometimes ( see under Hylidae in list of families ) ; in fact different frogs find a variety of ways to avoid desiccation ( Buxton 1923 , p. 96 ) . The extent to which dry country is a barrier to amphibians is therefore another thing to be found out from their distributions , not decided in advance or by experiment . Some amphibians have been carried about by man for food , or as curiosities or pets , or to control insects , or by accident . Pope and Boring ( 1940 ) mention commercial shipments of the Giant Salamander from japan to China and say that there has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only because it is carried for food but also because it is kept as a curiosity by royalty and other rich persons , and that this probably accounts for certain unexpected records , including one from the sea at Amoy . Boulenger ( 1936 , p. 307 ) says of the Edible Frog , Rana esculenta , that it is in England confined to the fens of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire , where it was probably introduced in the Middle Ages by Italian monks , since some of the British specimens agree with an Italian variety . Whether or not this frog really was brought to England so early , it has certainly been introduced there a number of times more recently , its history in England being one of repeated introduction and , after a varying number of years , disappearance of the introduced colonies ( M. Smith 1951 , pp. 141-143 ) . The Giant Toad , Bufo marinus , native to the mainland of tropical America , has been introduced in attempts to control insects on many of the West Indies , Bermuda , the Hawaiian Islands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solomons , and other Pacific islands . Many more instances like these could be given . Perhaps even more important is the fact that small frogs are carried around by children of every race , without record . And perhaps most important of all is the fact that some frogs , including tree frogs which can hide in thatch on boats or in bunches of bananas , are often transported accidentally , especially in the tropics . In some cases the hand of man is easily detected , but in others it is not . Human agency should always be suspected when an amphibian turns up in an unexpected place . But all this concerns details and has little to do with the main pattern of amphibian distribution .  | Limits of distribution of amphibians The northern and southern limits of distribution of existing amphibians ( Fig , 19 ) are all set by frogs . Typical frogs of the genus Rana go farthest north . Rana temporaria in Europe reaches the northern limit of land in Scandinavia at about 71 ? N. , well above the Arctic Circle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Asia too . A subspecies of Rana sylvatica reaches or crosses the Circle in the west of North America and occurs nearly to the northern tip of the subarctic Labrador Peninsula in the east . Typical toads of the genus Bufo come close to the arctic in Europe , to about 65 ? N. , but apparently reach only about 60 ? N. in western North America and a little above 55 ? in Labrador . Tree frogs of the genus Hula reach only about 57 ? N. in Europe , perhaps not much above 52 ? in eastern Siberia , and to about 62 ? in western North America and 55 ? in the east , but another hylid genus , Pseudacris , which lives more in swamps and on the ground than in trees , approaches the Arctic Circle in western North America . Of salamanders , Hynohius keyserlingii of Siberia crosses the Arctic Circle to Verkhoyansk ( Dunn 1923 ) , which  | is one of the coldest places in the world in winter , with a January mean of - 59 ? F. and a minimum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Webster 's Geographical Dictionary ) . This is an example of the fact noted by Wynne-Edwards ( 1952 , p. 24 ) , that summer rather than winter temperatures determine the limits of northern amphibians . Other salamanders are not known even to get near the Arctic Circle . They reach only about 63 ? N. in Europe and perhaps only about 59 ? and 53 ? in western and eastern North America respectively . Salamanders thus fall short of the northern limits of Rana and Bufo in Europe and of Rana and hylids in North America . These details are from Ekman ( 1922 ) , Mertens and Muller ( 1940 ) , Mills ( 1948 ) , Schmidt ( 1953 ) , Wynne-Edwards ( 1952 ) , Logier and Toner ( 1955 ) , Harper ( 1956 ) , and other sources . The northernmost frogs ( Rana ) extend into regions where the subsoil is permanently frozen ( Harper 1956 , p. 99 ) . How they survive the arctic winter is , I think , still unknown . Perhaps they hibernate under water deep enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the tip of South Africa , Tasmania south of Australia , New Zealand , and the tip of South America and Tierra del Fuego . ( Bridges 1948 , p. 447 , mentions small , unidentified frogs on Tierra del Fuego . I am indebted to Dr. C. T. Parsons for sending me this reference , after I had despaired of finding one to frogs so far south . ) The limits of distribution of amphibians on islands too ( Fig. 19 ) are set by frogs . Salamanders are confined to mainland areas and continental islands such as the British Isles , Japan , the Riu Kius , and Formosa ; a supposed record from Haiti in the West Indies is now discredited . Caecilians inhabit the continental tropics of Africa , Asia , and America , and occur on such continental islands as Ceylon , Sumatra , Java , and Borneo , and in America on Trinidad , but they do not occur on Madagascar or the West Indies proper and do not cross Wallace 's Line . In these directions they are as sharply limited as strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands of Palawan and Mindanao , but so do a few cyprinid fishes . In only one place do caecilians notably surpass the limits of distribution of strictly fresh-water fishes , and that is on the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean . This is the more remarkable because of the absence of caecilians on Madagascar . Frogs are present on all habitable continents and most continental islands , including all those mentioned above , and they are native also on some doubtful or biologically oceanic islands including Madagascar , the Seychelles , the whole Indo- Australian Archipelago including the Philippines and Solomons and perhaps the Palau and Fiji Islands , and on New Guinea , Australia , Tasmania , New Zealand , and the West Indies . Additional details and references are given in Chapter 8 . An interesting detail is that Newfoundland , although it is a large continental island near the mainland , seems to lack native amphibians as well as fresh-water fishes and reptiles . A negative fact like this is hard to prove , but at least I have been unable to find any records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) which has apparently been introduced in loads of hay from Nova Scotia ( Mills 1948 , p. 7 ; H. J. Squires in letter of October 24 , 1951 ; C. H. Lindroth in letter ) . Within the general limits of amphibians , a few genera especially of frogs are very widely distributed . Rana , in a broad sense ( Fig. 21 ) , inhabits all Africa , Eurasia , and North America and reaches the northern edge of Australia and the northern half of South America . Bufo ( Fig. 22 ) is on all the continents except Australia . Hyla ( Fig. 25 ) is world-wide except for a great gap in Africa and the Oriental tropics . But all other genera of frogs are much more limited in distribution . Of salamanders , Triturus is discontinuously Holarctic , but all other genera are much more localized . Of caecilians , no genus is known to extend beyond the limits of one region . No species of amphibians extends much beyond the limits of one region . Within the limits described , two of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Caecilians are almost entirely tropical . They enter the edges of the temperate zones , to a very limited extent , only in eastern Asia and southern South America . Salamanders are mostly north-temperate . The occurrence of one in tropical West Africa is very doubtful . Several do occur in the edge of the tropics in eastern Asia ( see under Salamandridae in list of families ) . Ambystomid salamanders enter the edge of the tropics in Mexico , but only at rather high altitudes . And the plethodontid genus Oedipus or its components occur in the American tropics south to Bolivia ; some species of this genus are on mountains , but others are in the full lowland tropics ; one lives on the equator at the mouth of the Amazon ( see under Plethodontidae in list of families ) . Although most salamanders are adapted to live only within a narrow range of cool temperature , the exceptions suggest that the animals are not inherently cold-adapted but may have as wide potential adapt- ability as frogs . This is a good example of the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the greatest numbers of them are in the tropics . Of 37 families and subfamilies of them here recognized , 27 are confined to the tropics or nearly so and 4 or 5 others are more tropical than temperate in distribution ( Fig. 20 ) . Of perhaps 2000 known species , about 80 per cent are tropical ; a little more than 10 per cent , north-temperate ; and probably less than 10 per cent , south-temperate . No group of frogs is both confined to and distributed over the whole of a temperate zone . Pelobatinae are almost entirely confined to the north-temperate zone , entering the tropics only on the Mexican Plateau , but they are few in number and are absent in much of Asia , although fossil in Mongolia in the Miocene ; and other subfamilies of Pelobatidae are isolated in the tropics in southeastern Asia , and on the Seychelles Islands . Discoglossidae occur chiefly in the northtemperate zone , but in the Old World only , and they are discontinuously distributed even there , occurring in Europe etc. and eastern Asia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island in the tropical Philippines . Finally , Ascaphus ( one species ) , which is sometimes placed in a family by itself , sometimes brigaded with Leiopelma of New Zealand , is confined to cold brooks in northwestern North America . These three groups of frogs are the only ones of family or subfamily rank that come near to being peculiar to the north-temperate zone ; all are primitive according to Noble ( 1931 ) ; and they all have relict distributions , either discontinuous or localized . A few other frogs that are primarily tropical enter the north-temperate zone in eastern Asia or eastern North America in such a way as to suggest local movements northward ( see Fig. 20 ) : at least five tropical Oriental genera besides Rana and Bufo , belonging to four families , reach central China , and two of them go still farther north , Rhacophorus to northern Honshu in Japan , and the brevicipitid Kaloula to Manchuria ; and in America three tropical genera of leptodactylids and one of brevicipitids reach Texas and in one case southern Arizona too , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Indiana , etc . Representatives of the dominant , widely distributed genera Rana , Bufo , and Hyla complete the list of frogs of the north-temperate zone except for a few that just enter its southern edge . In the south-temperate zone there is even less of a zonal frog fauna . The families Leptodactylidae and Hylidae are characteristic of the  | southern barrier-limited continents of South America and Australia , but they are not restricted to south-temperate climates ; in fact both families are primarily tropical in America . These facts suggest that frogs are primarily tropical animals , which frequently extend into the temperate zones locally or extensively and sometimes persist there for considerable times , but which do not form separate , dominant , primarily temperate faunas . Two genera of frogs have strongly radial distributions . Rana ( Fig. 21 ) , which includes most of our ordinary , familiar north-temperate frogs , is very well represented in the Old World tropics . It occurs through all Africa and all the habitable parts of Asia ; it has reached Madagascar ; it goes down through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included ) to the northern corner of Australia ; and it occurs through North America and ( in decreasing numbers ) through Central America to the northern half of South America ( see list of families for further details ) . It belongs to the family Ranidae , which , excepting Rana , is confined to the warm parts of the Old World . ( How many North American naturalists know that our common frogs are members of a great genus which has come from  | the Old World tropics and is just now sending spearheads into Australia and South America ? ) Bufo ( Fig. 22 ) , which includes the typical toads , occurs through all Africa , temperate and tropical Eurasia and islands to Celebes , etc. ( but not the Australian Region ) , and North , Central , and all or almost all South America , and on some West Indies . It belongs to the family Bufonidae , which , too , in a strict sense and excepting Bufo , is confined to the Old World tropics . ( How many North American naturalists know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way around the world and south to the farthest parts of Africa and South America ? ) The radial distributions of both these genera , and of their families , center on the main part of the Old World tropics . Two other families of frogs that do not have obviously radial distributions are worth consideration now . One is the family Brevicipitidae ( Microhylidae ) . This family ( Fig. 23 ) is divided by Parker ( 1934 ) into seven subfamilies . All of them occur in the Old World tropics and most of them are localized or have discontinuous ranges there , the largest concentrations of them being now in Madagascar , tropical Asia , and the tropical part of the Australian Region . One of the subfamilies , Microhylinae , which occurs mainly in tropical Asia , extends northward into temperate eastern Asia , reaching Manchuria .  | This is the only subfamily that occurs in America , where again it is mainly tropical . ( See list of families for further details . ) The other family to be considered now is the Leptodactylidae ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a few reach New Guinea ; they are numerous also in South and Central America , and a few reach north to southern Texas and Arizona . An isolated genus , Heleophryne , in South Africa may belong to this family , but it is doubtful . Except for Heleophryne , living leptodactylids are unknown outside the Australian Region and the warm parts of America . However , a fossil ( Eocene ) frog from Bombay in tropical India is put in this family ; and the fact that bufonids , which are thought to be derived from leptodactylids , apparently originated in the main Old World tropics confirms the former presence of leptodactylids there . These four families , Ranidae , Bufonidae , Brevicipitidae , and Leptodactylidae , form a significant sequence ( Figs. 21 to 24 ) . Something can be said of the history of each family considered alone . Ranidae have evidently radiated in the main Old World tropics , and Rana has spread from there over most of the rest of the world . Bufonidae and Bufo have probably had a generally similar history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread of Bufo over much of the world . Brevicipitids have evidently radiated primarily in the Old  | World tropics but seem to be retreating there now , and one subfamily has got through the north to the American tropics and reradiated there . And leptodactylids apparently occurred in the main Old World tropics once but have withdrawn from there and now survive in Australia , the warmer part of America , and perhaps South Africa . These histories are based on facts or obvious clues . However , something less obvious but more important than the separate histories emerges when the four families are considered together . They form an apparent sequence which suggests a common pattern of evolution and dispersal . It looks as if successive families have evolved in the main area of the Old World tropics , radiated from there , and then in the case of the older families retreated or become extinct there with the rise of later families , the older ones surviving chiefly in peripheral or barrier-limited areas . Rana and Bufo are near the height of this apparent cycle , brevicipitids farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families just discussed are all primarily amphibious or terrestrial ; none of the four is primarily arboreal , although they include aboreal derivatives . The two principal arboreal families of frogs , Ilylidae and Rhacophoridae , form an independent geographical pattern . Hyla ( Fig. 25 ) is world-wide except for a gap in most of Africa and tropical Asia . Species of Hyla increase in numbers with distance from this gap . There are few across temperate Eurasia , more in temperate North America , and still more in Central and South America , especially in the tropics there ; and there are many also , isolated , in New Guinea etc. and Australia . ( How many North American naturalists know that our tree frogs and northern spring peepers are outliers of a genus which swarms in the rain forests of tropical America and , with marsupials , in New Guinea and Australia ? ) Most other hylids are in South and Central America , where Hyla is reinforced by many other genera ( see list of families for further details ) . This distribution might be the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread of Hyla from there ( if a way was open to Australia ) or of a primary radiation from some other center and secondary radiations in America and the Australian Region . If the latter , the history of hylids may have followed the pattern suggested by the ground-living families . Hylids may have radiated first in the main Old World tropics and later disappeared there ; Hyla may have spread from there to the Australian Region and America and reradiated in these places ; and additional hylids may have reached  | America , perhaps before Hyla did so . Hyla would not need continuous forest for its dispersal . Most species of the genus are tree frogs , but some are rock dwelling or even terrestrial , and a few , though very little modified in structure , live in and can cross deserts ( see again Hylidae in list of families ) . There is a good possible reason for the disappearance of hylids in the Old World tropics : the rise of tree frogs of the family Rhacophoridae ( Fig. 25 ) . Rhacophorids are numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical Asia , etc . They reach southern China and Japan but are otherwise absent in the north-temperate zone , and they do not reach the Australian Region or America . They are dominant in an area almost exactly complementary to that now occupied by Hyla . Rhacophorids overlap the range of Hyla probably only in part of eastern Asia and on Timor , etc. ( see list of families ) . Rhacophorids may be near the beginning of a cycle of radiation from the main Old World tropics , and they may be overrunning and replacing Hyla as they radiate . The hypothesis of spread of successive groups of frogs from the Old World tropics has been set forth in different words in my Quarterly Review article ( 1948 , p. 21 ) . It is based on comparison of the  | distributions of families without regard to their phylogenetic position . It is important to find whether the distributions are correlated with phylogeny . Frogs are derived from an amphibian which had ribs and a tail . Of existing frogs , ( 1 ) Leiopelmidae still have free ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , as someone has said , they still have muscles to wag the tail they no longer have . ( 2 ) Discoglossidae have free ribs even as adults ; Pipidae , only as larvae ; and the family Rhinophrynidae is tentatively associated with these families because it has similar vertebrae and because its supposed larva is pipid-like. ( 3 ) Pelobatidae lack free ossified ribs but have other somewhat primitive characters . The remaining , " higher " frogs form two main series , differing in technical characters of the skeleton and musculature : ( 4 ) Leptodactylidae , Atelopodidae , Bufonidae , and Hylidae ; and ( 5 ) Ranidae , Rhacophoridae , Phrynomeridae , and Brevicipitidae . The five groups numbered above are usually treated as suborders ( Noble 1931 ; Romer 1945 , p. 591 ; etc. ) and are of course defined by various characters in addition to those mentioned . The suborders are named in the list of families . These five groups , although not necessarily related in any direct or simple way , apparently represent stages in frog evolution . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first , most primitive group survives only locally , in northwestern North America and in New Zealand . The families of the second group , though not so strikingly relict , are discontinuously distributed or localized and are nowhere dominant . The third group too is discontinuously distributed and is confined to certain parts of the world , but is subdominant in part of the Orient . The fourth and fifth groups both are nearly cosmopolitan , and both include radiating families and families which are dominant in various places ; but the fourth group tends to predominate in peripheral or barrier-limited continents , and the fifth group , which Noble considers the highest of all , now predominates in the main area of the Old World tropics . In short , the most primitive groups of frogs are the most localized ; successively higher groups are increasingly dominant ; the next to the highest groups are dominant peripherally ; and the highest of all are dominant primarily in the Old World tropics . This general correlation fits well enough with the idea of radiation of successive groups from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit suggest complexities but do not ( I think ) spoil the main correlation .  | As a general rule , I do not like to stress details in zoogeography , but one detail of frog distribution does seem especially significant in this connection . The presence of a very primitive frog on New Zealand and the complete absence of related frogs in Australia and South America suggest succession and replacement of frog faunas on the continents . Fossils tell little about the geographical history of frogs . The leptodactylid Indobatrachus , in India in the Eocene , may be the only frog fossil of much geographical importance ? if even it is beyond doubt . Some other fossils show that certain frogs were at certain places at certain times , but the details shown are mostly minor ones , and there is too much doubt about some of them . For example , a Hyla was described from the Lower Miocene of Europe by Noble ( 1928 ) , who admitted the imperfection of the specimen but said , " I do not hesitate to refer the species to Hyla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual specimen and decided that it was not a hylid . Yet the fossil is still commonly cited in the record of Hyla ( Romer 1945 , Darlington 1948 , Schaeffer 1949 ) . I do not know the rights of this matter ; the point is that it is doubtful . Another fossil frog from the Oligocene-Miocene of Europe has been assigned to the Hylidae and to the existing genus Amphignathodon , a highly specialized genus now confined to a small area in South America , but Hoffstetter ( 1945 ) has shown that the European fossil is not Amphignathodon but the skull of a frog incorrectly associated with the jaw of a lizard ! Schaeffer ( 1949 ) has done a useful thing in bringing together recent records of fossil frogs , but I doubt if the fossils mean as much as he implies they do . The fact is , I think , that frogs are among the animals of which the fossil record is still inadequate , and of . which the distribution of existing forms is still the best guide to their geographical history . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faunas of different parts of the world in rnuch detail , but their general composition and relationships will be summarized . The amphibians of the north-temperate zone have already been  | mentioned ( pp. 134 ? 135 ) : salamanders ; a few primitive groups of frogs , all more or less localized ; a few frogs of tropical groups which enter temperate eastern Asia and/or temperate North America ; and ( dominating the fauna ) representatives of the three great frog genera Rana , Bu f o , and Hyla ( plus two other hylid genera in North America ) . The amphibian faunas of the two halves of the north-temperate zone , Eurasia and North America , are much alike as wholes but different in details , and amphibians are very unevenly distributed on each continent . Salamanders illustrate this . Within the north-temperate zone , salamanders occur as follows ( Table 3 ) : in Europe and adjacent parts of southwestern Asia and North Africa , 3 families , 8 genera , about 20 full species ; in a great area of western and northern Asia , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , China , and Japan , 3 families , 11 genera , at least 42 species ; in western North America , from the lower corner of Alaska through California , 3 families , 10 genera , 25 species ; in west-central North America including the Great Basin , Rocky Mountains , and Great Plains , only one wide-ranging species of Ambystoma and a few localized , geographically isolated ambystomids and plethodontids ; and in eastern North America , from the Ozarks , eastern Texas , etc. , to the Atlantic , and from southern  | Canada to Florida , 7 families , 20 genera , and about 64 full species . It will be seen that salamanders are concentrated in four widely separated areas in the north-temperate zone : Europe etc. , eastern Asia , western North America , and eastern North America ; and only the latter has a nearly complete representation of existing families . Many families and genera of salamanders have discontinuous ranges ( Table 3 ) , and fossils indicate that some of them once occurred far outside their present ranges : e.g. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both now confined to eastern Asia , are fossil in Europe in the Miocene . The geographical relationships of different groups run in every possible direction among the four main areas of distribution . Salamandrids link Europe and eastern Asia ; Hydromantes , Europe and western North America ; proteids , Europe and eastern North America ; certain Triturus , eastern Asia and western North America ; living cryptobanchids , eastern Asia and eastern North America ; and certain plethodontids and Araby stoma , western and eastern North America . The geographical pattern formed when an old , diverse , widespread fauna is depleted and withdraws into restricted areas is called a relict pattern . It ' has two main characteristics . The first is discontinuity : related forms tend to occur in widely separated areas , and fossils may occur far outside the ranges of the living forms . The second is diversity of geographical relationships : the geographical ties of surviving forms tend to be diverse and confused , reflecting chances of extinction and survival rather than directions of dispersal . The salamanders in the north-temperate zone illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tropical and south-temperate parts of the world are best considered together , so far as amphibians are concerned . Of caecilians it need be said here only that they are confined to separate areas , almost entirely within the tropics , in West Africa , East Africa , the Seychelles Islands , the Oriental Region , and America , and that the interrelationships of the forms in the different areas are uncertain . Salamanders extend only a little way into the northern edge of the tropics in the Old World , and the one group of them that is widely distributed in tropical America has evidently been derived rather recently from the north . Frogs ( including toads ) are abundant in the tropics and occur in a number of more or less separate areas of distribution . The frogs of Africa south of the Sahara ( Noble 1922 , pp. 64 67 ; 1924 ) belong to seven full families and about forty or more genera ? probably many more by modern standards . They are most numerous  | and diverse in the forests of tropical West Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the African tropics . Only Rana and Bufo go far into the Sahara ( Angel and Lhote 1938 , table opposite p. 378 ) ; Pyxicephalus , recorded from the south-central Sahara by Guibe ( 1950 ) along with several species of Bufo , is simply a Rana with shortened legs and improved digging apparatus ( Loveridge , in conversation ) . The temperate northwestern corner of Africa is inhabited by European amphibians , including at least three genera of salamanders , and frogs of the genera Discoglossus , Hyla , and Pelobates as well as Rana and Bufo . Temperate South Africa has various Rana and Bufo , a few frogs of other characteristic African groups , and two additional noteworthy genera . Heleophryne , with about four species , is confined to South Africa north only to Transvaal , and whether or not it is a leptodactylid ( see under Leptodactylidae in list of families ) , it is an isolated and presumably relict genus . And Breviceps , with a dozen or more species from South Africa northeast to Tanganyika , is the principal genus of African Brevicipitidae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa ; it is apparently retreating into South Africa as Heleophryne may have done . The frog fauna of Madagascar ( Noble 1931 , Grandidier and Petit 1932 , etc. ) is very different from that of Africa . The island lacks the pipids , bufonids including Bufo , phrynornerids , and Heleophryne of the continent . Ranids are few . Rhacophorids are relatively numerous , with two genera shared with Africa ( Megalixalus and Hyperolius ) , one shared with the Orient but not Africa ( Rhacophorus ) , and about four endemic . Brevicipitids are still more numerous ( Parker 1934 ) , with two subfamilies represented : Cophylinae , with eight genera , are confined to Madagascar ; Dyscophinae have one endemic genus ( Dyscophus ) in Madagascar but are otherwise confined to the Orient . There are also in Madagascar a few other frogs , of which the relationships are still doubtful . The frogs of the Seychelles Islands number only five species ( Parker 1936 ) . One ( Rana mascareniensis ) may be introduced , and another ( Megalixalus seychellensis ) is a distinct endemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three species in two genera form an endemic subfamily , Sooglossinae , of the family Pelobatidae . The frogs of tropical Asia , from India ( Boulenger 1890 ) to the continental islands of Sumatra , Java , and Borneo ( van Kampen 1923 ) include at least 6 families and 37 or more ? perhaps many more ? genera , some shared with Africa , others not , and some widely dis- tributed in the Orient , others localized . Those that reach the northtemperate zone in China have already been mentioned . About a dozen of the genera reach the Philippines ( Inger 1954 ) and include most of the frogs of those islands , which have otherwise only the relict discoglossid Barbourula and a couple of genera shared with the Australian Region via Celebes or the Moluccas . All the tropical Asiatic families ( except the Hylidae ) and at least nine of the genera range beyond Java and Borneo toward or into the Australian Region ( van Kampen 1923 , Mertens 1930 , Parker 1934 , etc. ) , but they follow no single pattern and reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 464 ) . The frogs of New Guinea ( Parker 1934 , Loveridge 1948 ) are dominated by Hyla ( with Nyctimystes ) , with something like 40 species on this one great island , and by brevicipitids , of which 2 subfamilies with 9 genera and more than 50 species are almost confined to New Guinea and neighboring islands . Also on New Guinea are a few Australian leptodactylids , one true Rana , and a few other rapids , of the subfamily Cornuferinae . The frogs of the Moluccas are like those of New Guinea but less diverse : a few Hyla , 2 genera of breviciptids , and a few Rana and Cornuferinae . The Cornuferinae , although few on New Guinea and the Moluccas , are relatively numerous on the Solomon Islands , where there is otherwise only Hyla , and are the only frogs on the Fiji Islands , where they may not be native ( p. 507 ) . The frogs of Australia and Tasmania ( Loveridge 1935 , Parker 1940 ) belong to only 2 main groups : Hyla , with 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Noble 's Criniinae ) . The latter form one or 2 endemic subfamilies with 14 genera and 56 full species in Australia and Tasmania , 3 genera ( none endemic ) and 5 species ( only 2 endemic ) in New Guinea , and none beyond ? but the whole assemblage is considered rather closely related to the American leptodactylids . Besides these , a very few New Guinean frogs reach tropical northern Australia : 2 closely related species of Hylarana ( or Rana ) do so , and also 2 New Guinean genera of brevicipitids , which are represented in North Queensland by 4 species , of which 2 are endemic . New Zealand has a single , very primitive genus of frogs , Leiopelma , already mentioned . The frog fauna of tropical and south-temperate America ( Noble 1931 ) is very rich , with about 7 full families and 60 or more genera , the exact count depending an a given author 's ideas at a given time ? but this is true of all large frog faunas . A fair part of this fauna  | reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller part reaches the West Indies ( Chapter 8 ) . The few tropical genera that reach the north-temperate zone in North America have already been mentioned . Different subfaunas of frogs can be distinguished in South America in different forested areas , in the grasslands , and in the mountains . Toward the southern end of South America the fauna diminishes , and in the wet south-temperate forests of southern Chile there is a very distinct suhfauna characterized by endemic genera of leptodactylids and atelopodids , by absence of all hylids , and by absence also of brevicipitids , pipids , and Rana ( Dunn , in letter of October 6 , 1946 ) . Above are summarized a number of more or less distinct frog faunas of tropical and south-temperate lands around the world . Now the geographical relationships that exist among these faunas are to be reviewed briefly . Africa , Madagascar , the Seychelles , and tropical Asia show a mixed pattern of frog relationships . Africa and tropical Asia share some groups of frogs , but each continent has several families that the other lacks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyperolius ) that reach Madagascar and in one case ( Megalixalus ) the Seychelles too are absent in the Orient . Two other genera ( Bufo , Hylarana ) occur in Africa and the Orient but are absent on Madagascar and the Seychelles . The brevicipitid subfamily Melanobatrachinae is known only in East Africa and South India . Bufonidae other than Bufo occur in Africa and the Malay region but are absent in Madagascar , the Seychelles , and the main part of the Orient . Rhacophorus , absent in Africa , has many species on Madagascar , none on the Seychelles , and many in the Orient from Ceylon and India eastward . The brevicipitid subfamily Dyscophinae , absent in Africa , has one genus confined to Madagascar , none on the Seychelles , and none in Ceylon or peninsular India , but two farther east , in southwestern China , Burma , the Malay Peninsula , Sumatra , and Borneo . Pelobatidae are absent in the main part of Africa and absent in Madagascar , have one small endemic subfamily on the Seychelles , none in Ceylon or peninsular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Orient , and of course another in the north-temperate zone . Some of these distributions will probably be changed by improvements in classification , discovery of new species , and recognition of species introduced by man ; but frog relationships in this part of the world are certainly mixed . There is here an example of the importance of knowing a situation as a whole . The whole pattern of distribution of  | frogs around and across the Indian Ocean is full of discontinuities and mixed relationships which indicate that the fauna is partly a relict one and that existing relationships are partly the result of extinction and survival rather than of simple dispersal . Under these circumstances , the relationships of some Madagascan frogs to Oriental ones do not necessarily indicate direct dispersal or a direct land bridge . On the whole , the frog faunas of tropical Africa , Madagascar , and tropical Asia are surprisingly different . From the Orient to New Guinea and Australia there is so great a change of frog faunas that , excepting Hyla , of which the distribution is widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Australia . Much of the change occurs between the Oriental Region and New Guinea ; however , there is no single boundary there for frogs , but rather a zone of transition including all the Lesser Sunda Islands , Celebes , and the southern Philippines ( p. 464 ) . Another great change occurs between New Guinea and the temperate part of Australia , but again the change is not at the water barrier and not at any single boundary . Some nine frogs ( two Rana or Hylarana , three leptodactylids , two Hyla , and two brevicipitids ) occur in both New Guinea and adjacent tropical Australia . I have collected seven of them . They are small frogs , most living in obscure habitats , and are not likely to have been carried by man . They show that New Guinea and Australia have been able to exchange some frogs . Yet the frog fauna of New Guinea is primarily a hylid-brevicipitid fauna , and that of Australia is primarily a hylid-leptodactylid fauna , and only hylids and leptodactylids occur in the temperate part of Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very different . The pelobatids , true bufonids , rapids , and rhacophorids of the Orient are represented in tropical America by only the ubiquitous genera Rana and Bufo ; and the pipids , leptodactylids , and hylids of tropical America are absent ( or in the case of Hyla nearly so ) in the Orient . The only frogs that occur in tropical Asia and tropical America and nowhere else ( except the adjacent parts of the northtemperate zone ) are brevicipitids of the subfamily Microhylinae , including Microhyla itself . Atelopodids , once considered exclusively tropical American , may occur in the Orient , but they may occur in Africa too ; their distribution is not properly known ( see list of families ) . The frog faunas of Africa and South America are very different . The African fauna is dominated by bufonids , rapids , and rhaco- phorids ; of these only Bufo and Rana are in South America . The South American fauna is dominated by leptodactylids , atelopodids , and hylids ; of these only one genus of doubtful leptodactylids and a few ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only frogs that occur in Africa and South America and nowhere else are the pipids , of which one subfamily is confined to Africa and the other to the northern half of South America . Pipids are primitive frogs according to Noble and are aquatic . Their distribution parallels that of some fresh-water fishes . There are apparently no direct relationships between Madagascan and American frogs . The frog faunas of Australia and South America are much alike , and this is the more surprising because most frog faunas are so different . Temperate Australia has only Hyla and leptodactylids , and both are numerous also in South America . But the distributions of these groups are neither exclusive nor simple , and there are many other groups of frogs in South America that are not in Australia , and some in the tropical part of the Australian Region that are not in South America . And it should be noted once more that the one group of frogs in New Zealand is not related to anything now known in either Australia or South America . On the whole the frog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wide distributions of Rana and Bufo only emphasize how little most frogs have spread in recent times . This is , I think , consistent with the hypothesis that spread of dominant frogs is balanced by localization and retreat of other , less dominant ones . Amphibians of Central America Central America , with Mexico , is a significant transition area for amphibians , as it is for fishes . From the north , several groups of North American amphibians reach the northern edge ( in some cases just the northwestern corner ) of Mexico . Ambystomid salamanders and spadefoot toads extend south to within the tropics on the Mexican plateau but do not reach tropical lowlands . Plethodontid salamanders and Rana extend through Central America to the northern half of South America . And Bufo extends still farther south . From the south , Central America receives more amphibians . Of caecilians , according to Dunn ( 1942 ) , 2 out of 6 South American genera reach Panama , and one of them continues through Central  | America to tropical Mexico . Of frogs , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 60 South American genera reach Central America , but they undergo progressive subtraction there . Dunn ( 1931 ) says that of at least 25 South American genera of leptodactylids , only 5 enter Central America , only 3 extend to Mexico , and only one reaches the Mexican plateau ( where , however , it has given rise to 2 endemic genera ) ; of 10 South American genera of atelopodids , only 4 enter Central America , and none extends north of Nicaragua ( but there is one on Cuba ) ; of at least 13 South American genera of hylids , not more than 6 reach Central America ( but 2 more are endemic there ) , and only Hyla reaches the main part of North America ( but 2 more genera are endemic there ) ; and of about 8 South American genera of brevicipitids , only 3 reach Central America , but 2 of them extend through Mexico into the United States . This summary is superficial , but it is enough to show in a general way how North and South American amphibian faunas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transition occurs in Mexico and Central America , but the overlapping is actually much wider than this , for a few North American groups extend well into South America , and a few South American ones extend into North America . This transition has been described as it is now , in terms of present distributions , without regard to direction of movements . Movements have evidently occurred in both directions , but there may have been retreats too ; the whole process has probably been very complex . Since Noble 's and Dunn 's summaries ( above ) , much work has been done on Mexican and Central American amphibians . Smith and Taylor ( 1948 ) have summarized the mass of new information in a very useful way for Mexico , but no one has done it for Central America , and I can not do it . Part of the difficulty is that there has been much splitting of genera of Central American amphibians . Whether or not this is good taxonomically , it is bad zoogeographically , for it complicates things beyond the understanding of anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , broad genera so far as they are natural , and to reduce most of the new ones to subgenera . This would allow as fine splitting as taxonomists wish , without confusing zoogeographers . One Central American frog has turned out to be more isolated than Noble and Dunn realized . It is Rhino phrynus dorsalis , a specialized , burrowing frog formerly included in the Leptodactylidae but now put in a monotypic family , confined to parts of tropical Mexico and Guate- mala ( Smith and Taylor , p. 34 , footnote 24 , and references given there ) . This frog , in spite of its specialization , is apparently much more primitive than any other in Central America ? perhaps near the evolutionary level of the discoglossids and pipids . It is presumably a relict , the only striking amphibian relict in Mexico or Central America . Unfortunately its ancestry and geographical source ( whether North , Central , or South America ) are unknown . Transitions and barriers in distribution of amphibians Where different amphibian fauns meet there is usually no sharp line between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from both faunas , in opposite directions . In eastern Asia , where tropical and north-temperate amphibian faunas meet without major barriers other than climate , caecilians and a number of tropical frogs reach the eastern Himalayas or South China , five genera of the frogs extend north to central China , and one of them reaches Manchuria , and another , Japan ; and a few northern salamandrids and Hyla extend south into limited areas of tropical southeastern Asia . In Central America the transition of northern and tropical faunas is much more extensive among amphibians than among strictly freshwater fishes : relatively more amphibians are involved and some of them extend farther in each direction than any of the fishes do . Amphibians have evidently moved across Central America more often and farther than fresh-water fishes have done . Between Asia and Australia , across Wallace 's Line , where strictly fresh-water fishes hardly enter , Oriental and Australian frogs overlap in a broad and complex way . Frogs have evidently crossed the narrow gaps of salt water often . It is hardly necessary to give further details . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to fishes , but some of them cross it , as some fishes do . Other barriers are much less important to amphibians than to fishes . If deserts and mountains are important , they are so only temporarily . Nothing ? neither climates , nor deserts , nor mountains , nor even narrow gaps of salt water ? has prevented the spread of dominant frogs over the world in the course of time . The predominant existing amphibians are frogs of the genus Rana . This genus is represented by many species throughout the main tropical and temperate regions of the Old World and North America ,  | although not more than two species ( actually species of Hylarana ) reach northern Australia and only one reaches ( northern ) South America . Individuals of some of the species are numerous too . The genus as a whole , considered in a fairly broad sense , is rather diverse in structure and habits , and includes amphibious , aquatic , terrestrial , and burrowing forms . The genus is dominant in both main climatic zones , tropical and north-temperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including cold and arid ones : for example , it includes the northernmost of all amphibians , and it is one of the two frog genera that are widely distributed in the Sahara . Its distribution is therefore nearly continuous over a large part of the world , with less regard for climates and barriers than any other amphibians show . All these things go together to make a picture of a dominant group with a radial distribution , comparable in general , though not in detail , to the dominant fresh-water fish family Cyprinidae . The fossil record is not good enough to show whether the radiation of Rana has been correlated with the retreat of other frogs , but it may have been . The distribution of leptodactylids , which are now numerous only in Australia and the warm parts of America , is complementary to the area of abundance of Rana . The rise of rapids may account for the disappearance of leptodactylids from the main , accessible part of the world , while the leptodactylids have survived in the barrier-protected continents where Rana is just arriving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brevicipitids are mostly small and seldom found in numbers , and they tend to live in hidden places ( Parker 1934 , pp. 1 and 14 ) . They may be retreating ecologically as well as geographically before the dominant rapids . I know of no obvious explanation of the success of rapids and Rana . They evidently have superior qualities of some sort which make them better than other frogs in many different situations . Buf o has a pattern of geographical radiation and dominance second only to that of Rana among amphibians . It is less numerous in species and less diverse in structure and habits than Rana , but it can exist in a variety of places including both warm and cold and both humid and arid ones . Some other frogs are dominant only in smaller areas or special habitats . The distribution and complementarity of dominant frogs over . the world is diagrammed in Figure 26 . Competition among frogs is repeatedly assumed in the preceding pages . It is inherent in the concept of dominance , in the idea of 155 replacement of some frogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are of course all related matters . It seems to me that it is not possible to understand or explain frog distributions satisfactorily without taking competition as a premise . Different groups of frogs apparently often compete in wide areas rather than on narrow fronts , and the outcome may be decided during long periods of time , perhaps more by adaptability than by initial adaptations . The competition must be complex , and the details of it are almost all beyond present knowledge . Competition may occur also between frogs and salamanders . That the former jump and the latter do not does not change the fact that the requirements of typical forms of both orders  | are about the same , and that , typically , both have aquatic , probably sometimes competing , larvae . Summary : the pattern of distribution of amphibians The main pattern of distribution of amphibians , as of fresh-water fishes , contains at least five subpatterns . First is limitation . Amphibians are limited to an area from points above the Arctic Circle to or nearly to the main limits of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some doubtful islands including New Zealand , but they are absent ( unless introduced ) even on habitable islands in most remote oceanic areas . Within these limits , subpatterns of zonation and radiation of different amphibians are plain and already sufficiently discussed . The fourth subpattern , of differentiation of continental faunas , is well marked too among amphibians , but is complex . And finally , among amphibians as among fresh-water fishes , there is a fifth subpattern , of concentration in large and favorable areas and subtraction marginally . This subpattern is particularly well shown by concentration of salamanders in four main areas in the north-temperate zone ( Fig. 19 ) , but it is characteristic also of other amphibian faunas to a greater extent than space has been taken to describe . The main faunas do tend to be concentrated in large , favorable areas . Where different main amphibian faunas meet , there is transition : overlapping of marginal elements with progressive subtractions . As to the place of relicts in the pattern , caecilians and salamanders are ancient and in that sense relict ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north-temperate zone respectively . It is noteworthy that there are no geographically isolated species of these very ancient orders in Australia or on remote islands , excepting caecilians on the Seychelles . Of frogs , the first three suborders are phylogenetic relicts , but only one genus of them , Leiopelina on New Zealand , is geographically isolated , beyond the reach of higher frogs . It is comparable to the lungfish in Australia . ( But Australia has no notably primitive , relict frogs ! ) A small group of pelobatids is confined to the Seychelles . Other phylogenetically relict frogs ( the first three suborders ) occur on the main continents and are divided between the tropics and the north-temperate zone . The tropical Orient has a discoglossid and pelobatids ; Africa and South America , pipids ; tropical Mexico and Guatemala , the only known rhinophrynid ; and the north-temperate zone , a leiopelmid , discoglossids , and pelobatids . In proportion to its whole frog fauna , the north- temperate zone has more groups and more species of relict frogs than the tropics have . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of amphibians has evolved and what it tells of ancient lands and climates , I shall outline a hypothetical history of amphibian dispersal which gives or implies the answers ( Fig. 27 ) . I shall begin in the Cretaceous , with frogs . At that time , the ancestors of most existing frog families were probably in the Old World tropics . There may have been other , now extinct families in other parts of the world , but there is no clear record of them . Perhaps during the Cretaceous , early leiopelmids , once present in at least the Old World tropics , became extinct in the tropics but survived in the north- and south-temperate zones ; and later they were  | reduced to relicts in northwestern North America and New Zealand . Probably late in the Cretaceous , aquatic pipids got from the Old World tropics to South America . If fresh-water fishes filtered through the north-temperate zone then , so probably did the pipids . Later , pipids withdrew from the north and from tropical Asia , surviving in Africa and South America . Perhaps still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old World tropics into temperate Eurasia , leaving a rear guard in the Philippines . And Pelobatidae may now be withdrawing northward from the Old World tropics . The disappearance of these groups from the main Old World tropics was presumably caused by the evolution there of higher frogs . Successive dominant families of higher frogs seem to have originated in the Old World tropics and radiated from there over much or all of the world . The earlier families in the succession have disappeared in the Old World tropics as later families have risen there , but the older families survive peripherally , especially in Australia and South America . Leptodactylids , brevicipitids , bufonids , and rapids may have formed one such succession and hylids and rhacophorids another . All of these families except the rhacophorids reached America , probably through the north . The brevicipitids show very well how Old World tropical frogs can filter through the north to the American tropics . Of course the details of all this must have been very complex . Whether caecilians and salamanders fit into this hypothetical pattern of successive radiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tropical . They may have filtered through the north from the Old to the New World tropics as some frogs have done . They may never have reached Australia ; or they may have reached it and become extinct there later , as leiopelmid frogs probably did . Salamanders are more of a problem . Have they been confined to the north-temperate zone since their origin , probably before the Mesozoic , until one group of them recently became able to push deep into the American tropics ? Or were salamanders once widely distributed in the Old World tropics , and have they disappeared there without leaving any relicts on isolated mountains or islands ( the few salamanders in the edge of the tropics in Asia are not relicts but outlying species of existing temperate-Asiatic groups ) ? Neither of these alternatives is fully satisfactory , but I prefer the second one . The present northern zonation of most salamanders could be a stage in a slow shift from the Old World to the New . Competition with domi- nant frogs might account for the disappearance of salamanders from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of existing salamanders in the north-temperate zone ( Table 3 ) , with many discontinuities , and with the greatest concentration now in eastern North America , suggests a withdrawal from the Old World toward the New . If it is occurring , the withdrawal is complicated by radiation of hynobiids in eastern Asia , and in other ways , but in complex groups during long times movements should not be expected to be simple . This hypothetical history accounts for the distribution of existing amphibians without startling land bridges or drifting continents . However , the present distribution of these animals may have little to do with very ancient times . Existing orders of amphibians are probably old , pre-Mesozoic in origin , but their present distributions are probably much more recent , perhaps products of late Cretaceous and Tertiary events , and may tell nothing of the world before that .  | In my work on the geography of reptiles I have been aided by the same persons and in much the same ways as acknowledged at the beginning of the preceding chapter , and in addition Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underwood , and especially Ernest E. Williams have very generously answered questions and given me special , often unpublished , information . Romer ( 1945 ) presents a good , general account of the evolution and fossil record of reptiles , which should be read by everyone unfamiliar with these animals who wishes to understand them and their distribution . The main system of classification used here follows Romer 's ( 1956 ) new Osteology of the Reptiles , which he kindly allowed me to see in manuscript . However , I shall be concerned only with existing reptiles and their immediate fossil relatives , and with a few ancient groups ( especially dinosaurs ) which may be geographically significant . The age of reptiles was the Mesozoic . Existing reptiles represent only a few groups of all that there were then , but they belong to three different subclasses which have been separate since the Triassic . These subclasses are represented by turtles , crocodiles , and lizards and snakes with Sphenodon . Turtles have existed since the Triassic and have changed very little since then . Crocodiles too are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they too have undergone little visible change during their long history . Within the third subclass , the order Rhynchocephalia appeared in the Triassic and was probably cosmopolitan in the early and middle Mesozoic . Rhynchocephalians are not known fossil later than the Lower Cretaceous , but nevertheless one of them ( Sphenodon ) still exists , on remote New Zealand . Lizards , which may be derived from the same stock as rhynchocephalians , appeared in the Jurassic ; and snakes , which are derived from lizards , appeared in the Cretaceous . Some existing families of turtles and also crocodiles and their allies and rhynchocephalians have left revealing fossil records . Lizards and snakes have left a record sufficient to show their origin and evolution in a general way , but not sufficient to tell much about their geographical histories . Among existing reptiles , as among amphibians , there is a correlation between numbers , taxonomic and ecological diversity , and extent and diversity of area occupied . The ancient Rhynchocephalia , with one existing species , are now strictly limited in all ways . Existing crocodilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all are amphibious or aquatic ( except that their eggs are laid on land ) ; and they are confined to the tropics and some warm edges of the temperate zones . Existing non-marine turtles form 7 families , 50 or more genera , and about 200 or more species ; they are mostly amphibious or aquatic ( except that their eggs are laid on land ) , but several groups of Testudinidae have become terrestrial ; and turtles occur throughout the tropics and widely but irregularly in the temperate zones . Lizards and snakes are much the most numerogs and most widely distributed existing reptiles . The following careful estimate of their numbers was given in my Quarterly Review article ( 1948 , pp. 23 and 24 ) : of lizards , about 21 ( now reduced to 18 ) families , more than 300 genera , and nearly 3000 recognized species ; and of snakes , about 11 ( now reduced to 8 ) families , 300 genera , and 2600 species . Both lizards and snakes are nearly cosmopolitan and occur in a wide variety of climates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of all of them one family of snakes , Colubridac , is predominant , as will be described . Although both lizards and snakes are very widely distributed , they vary in numbers in different places . Lizards outnumber snakes ( in number of species ) in Europe and probably Africa and in New Guinea and Australia . Snakes outnumber lizards ( in species ) in  | southern and eastern Asia . In North America as a whole , the two groups are about equal in number of species , but there are more lizards in western North America and more snakes in the east . In South America , species of snakes may be more numerous in the main tropical part of the continent ; of lizards , in the south-temperate part . On islands , except some recent continental ones , lizards are usually much more numerous than snakes . However , regardless of how they compare in numbers of species , there are many more individual lizards than snakes in most parts of the world . Ecologically , reptiles are true land animals , basically independent of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or aquatic , but almost all of them return to the land to lay their eggs or bear their young . Of existing reptiles , only some sea snakes give birth in the water . Reptiles are much more numerous in a greater variety of land habitats than amphibians are , and they can disperse over land more rapidly . They are also more able to disperse across salt water . Their skins are relatively impervious ( but not completely so ? Bogert and Cowles 1947 ) , and some of them enter the sea or even live in it without injury . They drink little fresh water , and some of them can exist for considerable periods without any water at all . Their eggs are much more resistant than amphibian eggs and more likely to be dispersed by various means . All this is reflected in the relatively wide and complex distributions of reptiles and in their occurrence on islands . Only in cold places do amphibians have the advantage over reptiles . Reptiles are the only true land animals that are cold-blooded . They have greater heat requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This too is reflected in their distributions . Although reptiles are primarily land animals , existing crocodilians are amphibious and so are most turtles . Sphenodon lives on land but usually near water . And lizards and snakes are primarily terrestrial but diverse in their adaptations . Both lizards and snakes include a variety of ground-living , burrowing , and arboreal forms . There is an obvious tendency for lizards to occur in relatively dry , open places ; snakes , in damper , better-covered ones . But this is a tendency rather than a rule , and there are many exceptions to it . Both lizards and snakes occur in deserts , and both are abundant in tropical rain forest . Only a few lizards are amphibious and none is fully aquatic now ( some were in the Cretaceous ) , while several groups of snakes are aquatic ; but lizards probably have more adaptations to special niches . Lizards and snakes tend to differ in their food , and this must affect  | their distributions . Most lizards are wholly or partly insectivorous , and insects occur nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require larger prey , which may not be available in some places . It is probably because of their food requirements that individual snakes are usually relatively few ; and , aside from the food itself , sparseness of populations may affect both chances of dispersal across barriers and ability to maintain populations in small , isolated areas or localized niches . Lizards are disproportionately numerous on islands , and this is proof that they have unusual powers of crossing salt water ( Chapter 8 ) , but other factors are probably involved too . For reasons just given , lizards are probably better able than snakes to find food and to maintain populations in small , ecologically limited areas . Absence or scarcity of snakes on remote islands may in itself favor survival and multiplication of lizards there . Some reptiles , even more than amphibians , have been carried about by man , by accident or design . Some lizards are so regularly associated with man that they are called house lizards , and some of them have been carried great distances in the tropics and to many remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families ) . A small worm snake ( Typhlops ) has been so commonly carried about the Pacific and elsewhere in soil with plants that it is sometimes called the Flowerpot Snake . And turtles and less often other reptiles are commonly carried alive for food or as pets . On the other hand , man has caused the extinction of some reptiles in some places . He has destroyed giant tortoises on some islands within historic times , and he may have destroyed other reptiles elsewhere , because they were good food , like turtles or large snakes , or because they were dangerous , like poisonous snakes . Limits of distribution of reptiles The limits of distribution of reptiles are indicated in Figure 28 . The northernmost reptile is a lizard , Lacerta vivipara , which extends above the Arctic Circle , to at least 70 ? N. and perhaps to the limit of land in northern Europe , and nearly reaches the Circle in eastern Siberia ; it is the only viviparous ( ovoviviparous ) species of the family Lacertidae . ( The approximate limits of distribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here listed have been mapped by Hecht , 1928 . ) Next is a snake , Vipera beres , the European Viper , which too crosses the Arctic Circle , to above 67 ? N. , in Europe ; it and its representatives come within a degree or two of the  | Circle in part of Siberia ; it too is viviparous . Both the Lacerta and the Vipera occur throughout the northern forest zone of Eurasia ( Berg 1950 , p. 48 ) ; I do not know whether they occur to any extent north of the forest . Third in order of northern reptiles is an oviparous snake , Natrix natrix , which reaches about 65 ? N. in Scandinavia . Fourth is another viviparous lizard , Anguis fragilis , which reaches about 64% ? N. in Sweden ( Professor C. H. Lindroth in letter ? the record of this species on the Arctic Circle was an error ) . Fifth and sixth are probably a viviparous snake , Coronella austriaca , which occurs above 63 ? in Sweden , and a lizard , Lacerta agilis , which reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same genus as the northernmost lizard but is oviparous . In America , viviparous snakes of the genus Thamnophis ( garter snakes ? close relatives of Natrix ) are the northernmost reptiles by a wide margin , reaching at least 56 ? N. in British Columbia , 60 ? at Fort Smith in the Northwest Territories , and 49 ? in the east ( Logier and Toner 1955 ) . Other snakes , including both viviparous and oviparous ones , reach only 51 ? or 52 ? in the west and 47 ? or 48 ? in the east . Three lizards , of three different families , reach 50 ? or 51 ? N. in British Columbia ; two of them are viviparous and one oviparous . The nor- thernmost eastern lizard is oviparous Eumeces fasciatus , but it reaches only about 45 ? in southern Ontario , and on the Atlantic coastal plain it stops slightly above 42 ? . There are no lizards north of this along the Atlantic coast of North America , although about ten species of snakes and three families of turtles extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalists the erroneous idea that lizards are inherently unable to tolerate cold . ) Southward , many lizards and snakes reach the tip of South Africa . Some lizards and three elapid snakes reach Tasmania . Gekkonid and scincid lizards , but no snakes ( except straggling sea snakes ) , reach New Zealand , including South Island . And in America two or three small lizards of the family Iguanidae reach Tierra del Fuego ; and the southernmost snake is a pit viper , Trimeresurus ammodytoides , which reaches Santa Cruz Province in southern Argentina . The geckos of New Zealand ( two endemic genera ) are viviparous , and are the only known viviparous members of their family . The New Zealand skinks , about nine endemic species of the great genus Lygosoma , are viviparous too so far as known , but viviparity is common among skinks elsewhere . . ( The statement made in my Quarterly Review article , that New Zealand skinks lay eggs , was an error which was corrected by letters from two New Zealand herpetologists , H. B. Fell and Charles McCann . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the other species of the genus . I do not know the mode of reproduction of other southernmost reptiles . Although the main limits of reptiles are set by lizards and snakes , the limits of the other groups are to be noted . Sphenodon , on New Zealand , is near the southern limit of distribution of reptiles ; that this ancient reptile survives in a climate which is marginal for modern reptiles is especially noteworthy . Crocodilians occur ( or did so within recent historic times ) north of the tropics to Syria in western Asia ( Crocodylus ) , along the lower Yangtze in China ( Alligator ) , and in the Carolinas in eastern North America ( Alligator ) ; they extend a little south of the tropics in Africa and South America . Of turtles , Emys orbicularis ( Emydinae ) in Europe reaches at least 571/2 ? N. , but no other European turtle reaches even 50 ? . A Trionyx ( Trionychidae ) reaches about 48 ? in eastern Asia , but no other eastern Asiatic turtle occurs north of about 40 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is without turtles . In America , the most northern turtle , a Chrysemys ( Emydinae ) , reaches at least 51 ? in British Columbia and Manitoba , 49 ? or 50 ? above Lake Superior , and perhaps 48 ? along the east coast of North America . Southward , turtles reach  | the tip of Africa , southern Australia but not Tasmania ( except for straggling sea turtles ) , and northern Argentina in South America . Although a few species reach the arctic and also the southern tips of the continents , reptiles begin to decrease in numbers far short of these final limits . In Europe , they decrease northward much more rapidly than amphibians do : in southern Europe there are 37 genera , 89 species of reptiles , and 14 genera , 39 species of amphibians ; but in northern Europe , only 5 genera , 6 species of reptiles , and 6 genera , 11 species of amphibians ( Schreiber 1912 ) . In South America , reptiles decrease from the tropics southward . This is illustrated by the snakes of Argentina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one species in Santa Cruz ( Table 4 ) . As to the limits of reptiles on islands , there are almost no limits for lizards : they are numerous on every climatically suitable island within reasonable reach of a continent , and they are fewer but surely native on many remote islands , including the Mascarenes and Seychelles in the Indian Ocean , the islands of the western Pacific out at least to the Tongas ( beyond the Fijis ) and to New Caledonia and New Zealand , the Galapagos in the eastern Pacific , and not only the West Indies but also Bermuda , the Canaries , Madeira , and the Cape Verde Islands in the Atlantic . Beyond these limits , on still more remote islands especially in the tropical Pacific , there are a few geckos and skinks , but they have probably been carried by man . Further details of the occurrence of lizards and other reptiles on islands are given in Chapter 8 . A few families and genera of reptiles are very widely distributed .  | Of non-marine turtles , the family Testudinidae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( land tortoises ) occurs in much of Africa , the warm parts of Eurasia etc. , and South America , and on various islands . The most widely distributed genus of fresh-water turtles is Trionyx ( soft-shelled turtles of the family Trionychidae ) , in Africa , southern and eastern Asia , and eastern North America . The principal genus of crocodiles ( Crocodylus ) is almost tropicopolitan . Of lizards , the families Gekkonidae and Scincidae are tropicopolitan and extend into some warm-temperate areas , but no other lizard family is so widely distributed . The most widely distributed lizard genus is probably Lygosoma , which occurs in most of the warm part of the Old World , eastern North America , and Central America . Of snakes , the family Colubridae ( common snakes ) is cosmopolitan except that it does not reach the more remote parts of Australia ; the family Viperidae ( vipers etc. ) is almost equally widely distributed , except that it does not reach even part of the Australian Region ; and the families Typhlopidae ( burrowing worm snakes ) , Boidae ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coral snakes ) are . tropicopolitan and enter some warm-temperate areas . The genus Typhlops is tropicopolitan . Natrix ( mostly semi-aquatic water snakes , family Colubridae ) occurs over most of the Old World including part of Australia and in much of North America . But these cases are exceptional . In spite of the great powers of dispersal of some reptiles and the wide distributions of a few of them , many families , most genera , and almost all species of reptiles are rather limited in distribution . Crocodilians are primarily tropical . Except for the genus Alligator , the few that occur in the edges of the temperate zones are tropical species which extend into limited temperate areas . Alligator , however , is confined to warm-temperate areas in China and the southeastern United States . Turtles too are mostly tropical . The only genus that occurs around the north-temperate zone is Clemmys , with two species in the Mediterranean area ( one of them reaching the tropics in West Africa ) , five in eastern Asia ( south into the edge of the tropics ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three in eastern North America . One other genus in Europe etc . ( Emys ) and four or five in eastern North America are confined to limited temperate areas but do not have zonal distributions . Within the north-temperate zone , only  | eastern North America has many turtles , and the majority of them are emydines , which are even more numerous in the tropics of Asia and which enter the tropics in America . All the families and many of the genera of northern turtles occur also in the tropics . Details are given in the list of families . Most lizards too are tropical , and the north-temperate ones are not very different from tropical ones . All widely distributed northern lizards belong to families that are also tropical , and many belong to tropical genera . Lacerta , for example , which includes the northernmost reptile , ranges from arctic Eurasia to tropical Africa . Some genera of lizards and one small family ( Anniellidae ) are localized in parts of temperate Eurasia or North America , but every genus that occurs in both these areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truly Holarctic lizard genus is probably the anguid Ophisaurus , with one or two species in southeastern Europe , temperate North Africa , etc. ; two or three in the eastern Himalayas , Burma , southern China , and Formosa ; one in eastern North America ; and one in the mountains of Borneo , almost on the equator . There are some endemic genera of lizards in some south-temperate areas too , but they do not form a zonal fauna ; that is , the genera are not common to the south-temperate parts of the different southern continents . Snakes , too , are primarily tropical , with no well-defined northtemperate fauna . All northern snakes belong to tropical families , many to tropical genera . Vipera , which includes the northernmost snake , occurs also through the tropics of Africa and Asia . There is probably no truly Holarctic snake genus . Some genera are confined to parts of temperate Eurasia or North America , but every well-defined genus that occurs in both places occurs also somewhere in the tropics . Schmidt ( 1946 ) cites Opheodrys as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is for the most part , but it is well represented in the tropics in Indochina and there is a species in Yucatan in the edge of the American tropics . There is no zonal fauna of snakes in the south-temperate zone . In summary , reptiles have a zonal pattern of distribution only in that they are primarily tropical . There is no distinct , generally distributed , zonal reptile fauna in the north-temperate zone . Northtemperate reptiles are much fewer than tropical ones , and they all belong to tropical families , many to tropical genera . It looks as if tropical reptiles often invade the north-temperate zone but rarely becomes specially adapted to it and usually do not persist there long ,  | not long enough to become very different from their tropical relatives . The south-temperate zone too lacks a distinct , zonal reptile fauna . Another sort of zonal pattern , which might be called longitudinal zonation , is characteristic of certain families of lizards . These families are distributed north and south along continuities of land , across the climatic zones . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to South Africa . It makes up the main part of the lizard fauna of temperate Eurasia but does not reach America . In America , the family Iguanidae ranges from the northern limit of lizards in western Canada to the southern tip of South America . It makes up the main part of the lizard fauna of temperate North America but does not now occur in the continental part of the Old World . The lizard families Agamidae in the Old World and Teiidae in the New have somewhat similar distributions but are less important in the north . Of course longitudinal distributions occur to some extent among other animals and merge with other sorts of distributions ; i.e. , transitional situations occur . The significant thing is the large proportion of north-temperate lizards that belong to strongly longitudinal families , so that temperate Eurasia and North America differ more in their lizards than in most other groups of animals , except migratory land birds . Radial distributions are less obvious among reptiles than among fishes and amphibians . Dominant terrestrial reptiles probably disperse rapidly and pass through the radial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably lost quickly . However , a few families and genera of reptiles are radially distributed . The largest existing family of reptiles is the Colubridae , the family of common snakes . It is also the most widely distributed family : colubrids are numerous in all the main tropical and temperate parts of the world except Australia , where they are few and are apparently newcomers . Colubrids are also ecologically diverse : they occur in all ordinary habitats , hot and cold , wet and dry , etc. , so that the distribution of the family is nearly continuous across places that are inhospitable for many reptiles . The family Colubridae has certainly radiated geographically as well as in an evolutionary sense . However , the family 's present distribution is complex rather than simply radial . The best that can be said of the family as a whole is that the dominant , derivative forms seem to occur mostly in Africa and tropical Asia and , in smaller numbers and less diversity , in temperate Eurasia  | and North America ; that primitive forms tend to occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few , recent arrivals occur in Australia ( see list of families for further details ) . This seems to be a pattern of ( very complex ) radiation from the main part of the Old World tropics . As dominant snakes , colubrids are replaced in Australia by a very distinct , probably rather old , fauna of elapids . This is an unsolved anomaly . Elapids are apparently derived from colubrids , were therefore presumably later in origin , and ought not to have reached Australia first . Why did elapids reach Australia so long ago that all the Australian genera of them are now endemic , colubrids so recently that no genus is endemic ? The most widely distributed genus of Colubridae is Natrix , with about 80 species , in Africa and Madagascar , tropical and temperate Eurasia north to about 65 ? in Scandinavia , south through the islands to northern Australia , and in eastern ( not now western ) North Americe south to Guatemala , and on Cuba ; and Thamnophis ( garter snakes ) , derived from Natrix , occurs through the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south to Costa Rica . More species of Natrix occur in the Orient than anywhere else . This pattern of distribution is radial , centering on the main area of the Old World tropics , or , more precisely , on tropical Asia . The species of Natrix are usually associated with water but are not fully aquatic . They probably have the powers of dispersal of terrestrial snakes plus some of the ability of aquatic ones to cross water barriers . But Natrix probably has other , unknown , qualities which make it superior to most other snakes and which have impelled its radiation . Old World Natrix are oviparous ; American ones , viviparous ; and ( since viviparity in reptiles is sometimes an adaptation to cold climates ) this may be a hint that the American forms are descended from an ancestor which came from Eurasia through the north . ( I have used Natrix in a fairly broad sense . Some groups of the species , including for example those on Madagascar , are sometimes put in separate small genera . ) A few other large groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testudinidae centers in tropical Asia : emydines are most diverse and numerous there and extend in smaller numbers to temperate Eurasia and North and South America etc. ; testudiuines , probably derived from emydines in tropical Asia , extend even farther in some directions . Trionvchid turtles are most diverse in the main part of the Old World tropics ; one genus extends northward in eastern Asia and to North America ; and one has reached New Guinea . Scincids are very diverse in the Old World tropics ; a  | few extend northward ; and three Old World genera extend to America . Viperids are most diverse in the main Old World tropics , especially tropical Asia ; a few extend northward ; and two Asiatic genera extend to America ; but the rattlesnakes in America complicate this radial pattern . The two northern regions of the world ( Eurasia and North America above the tropics ) have reptile faunas characterized by what they lack more than by what they have . No family of reptiles is exclusively Holarctic . The only family confined to any north-temperate area is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only exclusively Holarctic genus of reptiles may be Alligator . ( A few other nearly Holarctic genera are noted under zonation of reptiles , above . ) Most dominant northern reptiles belong to families that are primarily tropical , especially emydine turtles , agamid lizards in Eurasia and iguanids in North America , and colubrid and viperid snakes . Besides these , each northern region has other reptiles derived from or shared with the tropics ( mostly the Old World tropics in the case of Eurasia , partly the Old World and partly the American tropics in the case of North America ) and often occupying rather small areas in the temperate zone . They include , of turtles , chelydrids in eastern North America , Testud'o in southern Eurasia and Gopherus in southern North America , and Trionyx in eastern Asia and eastern North America ; of lizards , a chameleon in the southern corners of Europe , geckos especially in central and eastern Asia , Xantusia in southwestern North America , a few skinks in large parts of Eurasia and North America , laccrtids far north in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguids widely scattered in Europe and North America , Shinisaurus in China , Heloclerma in southwestern North America , Varanus in the southern edge of Eurasia , and different amphisbaenids in southern Europe etc. and the southern corners of North America ; and of snakes , Typhlops in southern Eurasia and Leptotyphlops in southwestern North America , different small boils in Asia and western North America , and cobras in the southern edge of Asia and coral snakes in southern North America . In some of these cases tropical genera or species extend northward locally ; in others , species or genera are endemic in the temperate zone but belong to tropical families . But all these groups together in the north-temperate zone , those that are dominant plies  | those that are localized or marginal , make up faunas of much less than tropical richness . Not only are north-temperate reptiles relatively few and not very different from tropical ones ; also they are very unevenly distributed . Temperate Eurasia and North America differ especially in their dominant lizards , most of which belong to different families ( agamids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which are shared with the Old and New World tropics respectively . The Eurasian and North American reptile faunas differ in many other details , some of which are indicated in the preceding paragraph . Of course , temperate Eurasia and North America have some families in common and even genera : Clemmys and Trionyx ; Eumeces , Lygosoma , and Ophisaurus ; several genera of colubrid and viperid snakes ; and Alligator . But the differences outweigh the similarities . Temperate Eurasia and North America have largely different reptile faunas , evidently partly derived from different tropical regions , from the Old and New World tropics respectively . The distribution of reptiles within each northern region is uneven . The number of reptiles falls off rapidly northward , and there is eastwest differentiation . For example , western North America has few turtles and many lizards ( and many snakes ) ; eastern North America , many turtles and relatively few lizards ( and many snakes ) . This sort of unevenness is an effect of unevenness of climate , dry or wet , but the effect is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marginal zone where they can exist only under conditions particularly favorable for them . In the tropics , lizards are not so concentrated in dry , open , sunny places ; many occur in wet forests , and many others are nocturnal and avoid the sun . It is particularly in cool climates that many reptiles depend on the sun to maintain their temperatures during their daily activities ( Bogert 1949 ) and also to provide the heat necessary for reproduction ( see p. 558 ) . In short , north-temperate reptiles are relatively few and not much different from tropical ones but are so unevenly distributed that the temperate Eurasian and North American reptile faunas differ in many ways , especially in their lizards ; and the regional faunas are uneven in distribution too . In the tropical and south-temperate parts of the world , reptiles are so numerous and their distributions and relationships are so complex that they can be described only briefly . There are just too many details to give in a small space . Additional details will be found in the list of families at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sahara are trionychid and pelomedusid turtles and estudinine land tortoises but only one emydine , apparently a newcomer , which has entered only the northwestern corner of the African tropics ; a few agamid lizards , many true chameleons , many geckos , many skinks , many lacertids , cordylids , Varanus , and amphisbaenids ; and worm snakes of both families ( Typhlopidae and Leptotyphlopidae ) , pythons , a sand boa ( confined , in tropical Africa , to the east ) , many colubrids , elapids , and typical viperids ; and crocodiles . Most of these groups are widely distributed in tropical Africa and the majority , but not all , extend to South Africa too . Cordylid lizards are chiefly South African but extend north well into the tropics . There is some differentiation of reptile faunas between the wet forest and the drier , opener country , but this can not be gone into here ; it and some other features of the distribution of reptiles in Africa are discussed by Schmidt ( 1919-1923 ) . Madagascar has pelomedusid but not trionychid turtles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many chameleons , many geckos , skinks , a few cordylids ( only Gerrhosaurinae , not Cordylinae ) , but , no lacertids , no Varanus , and no amphisbaenids ; and typhlopid but not leptotyphlopid worm snakes , an endemic subfamily of boids but not pythons , and colubrids including supposedly primitive genera , but no elapids and no viperids ; and the Nile Crocodile . This Madagascan reptile fauna is chiefly African in its relationships but lacks many African families and includes many distinct endemic genera . Very few Madagascan reptiles are directly related to Oriental ones . Sibynophis is the only Madagascan-Oriental ( but not African ) genus that occurs to me ( see under Colubridae in list of families ) , although there may be a few others . The Indian chameleon is related to a Mediterranean , not Madagascan , species . Phelsunua , a Mascarene genus of geckos which reaches the Andaman Islands in the Oriental Region , is an insular genus rather than a Madagascan-Oriental one ( see list of families ) . Tropical Asia etc. ( the Oriental Region ) has the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trionychids ; many agamids , a chameleon , many geckos , many skinks , a few lacertids , a dibamid , a few Ophisaurus and Varanus , and Lanthanotus ; representatives of every family and almost every subfamily of snakes , although some of them are only marginal ; and crocodiles and gavials . Some of these groups are widely distributed in the Oriental Region but others are localized : e.g. , the platysternine and most of the emydine turtles are concentrated in the eastern part of the  | region ; the chameleon is confined to southern India and Ceylon ; the dibamid occurs only from southern Indochina southeastward on the islands ; most of the lacertids are on the mainland , only one species reaching the Sunda Islands ; Lanthanotus is confined to Borneo ; and the whole subfamily Uropeltinae of burrowing snakes , with some 43 species , is confined to part of peninsular India and Ceylon . The agamid genus Cophotis is known from one species in Ceylon and one in Sumatra and Java ; the agamid Draco has one species in southern India ( not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand miles from the main range of the genus in the eastern Orient ; in each of the scincid genera Lygosoma , Dasia , and Riopa there are pairs of species divided between southern India and the eastern Orient , with no closely related species in northern India ; and the aniliid genus Cylindrophis has a species isolated on Ceylon but is otherwise confined to the eastern Orient etc. ; and the species Varanus salvator occurs on Ceylon and in the eastern Orient but is absent from most of peninsular India . These groups show a pattern of discontinuity like that of some fresh-water fishes ( p. 63 ) . Smaller discontinuities perhaps proceeding in the same direction , of isolation of populations in southern India , occur among emydine turtles and viperid snakes ( see list of families ) . At least five species and two additional genera of snakes show a different discontinuity : they occur in Indochina and also in the Greater Sunda Islands but skip the Malay Peninsula and peninsular Siam ( M. A. Smith 1943 , pp. 25-26 ) . Ophisaurus shows a wider discontinuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As to relationships between the tropical African and Oriental reptile faunas , they share a number of important families , most of which occur in other parts of the world too , and they share also a number of genera : Testudo* ( land tortoises ) and Trionyx ( aquatic turtles ) ; Agama , Mabuya ? , Lygosoma , Lacerta , and Varanus ; Typhlops* , Python , Boiga and Natrix ? and some other genera of colubrids , Naja ( cobras ) , and Vipera ; Crocodylus " ; and others . Most of these genera occur also outside the limits of Africa and the Oriental Region . Some of them , starred above , occur on Madagascar , but the others do not ( or are probably not native there ) , and the latter are so numerous and varied as to show that Africa and tropical Asia have exchanged a variety of reptiles by mainland routes , while there is little to suggest that they have exchanged reptiles by way of Madagascar . But the differences between the African and Oriental reptile faunas show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences are that Africa has pelomedusid while the Orient has emydine  | turtles ; that Africa has more chameleons and lacertids while the Orient has more agamids ; that Africa alone ( of these two regions ) has amphisbaenids and cordylids , as well as leptotyphlopids , which barely reach the Orient , while the Orient has more snakes than Africa , including aniliids , several subfamilies of colubrids lacking in Africa , pit vipers , and most sea snakes . The Australian Region has chelyid turtles and ( in New Guinea ) Carettochelys and a trionychid ; many agamids and geckos , the endemic family Pygopodidae , many skinks , a Dibamus ( in New Guinea ) , and Varanus ; many T yphlops , a number of python genera , small tree boas ( in New Guinea , etc. ) , a few colubrids , and many elapids ( and sea snakes ) ; and crocodiles ( in the tropics ) . Except for the restrictions indicated above , and except that pygopodids are few in New Guinea and colubrids absent in much of southern and western Australia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of New Guinea and Australia . However , many of them fail to reach Tasmania , which has no turtles ( except straggling sea turtles ) , of course no crocodiles , no Varanus , no T yphlops , no pythonids , and no colubrids . , The relationships of Australian reptiles are mostly toward the Orient . The trionychid turtle in New Guinea ( if it is really native there ) is an Oriental species , which sometimes enters the sea . One of the crocodiles is an Oriental species , which habitually enters the sea . Of lizards , agamids are numerous in Australia as well as in the Orient ; Goniocephalus and Physignathus occur in the Oriental and Australian Regions and nowhere else , but their ranges are discontinuous , for both genera are absent from many of the intervening islands ; but , on the other hand , the aquatic agamid Lophura ( Hydrosaurus ) occurs only from the Philippines and Celebes to New Guinea . The gekkonid Gymnodactylus is numerous from the Orient to Australia but occurs elsewhere too , and two or three other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their ranges . Skinks , especially the genus Lygosoina in a broad sense , swarm from the Orient to New Guinea and Australia ; Tropidophorus , Ophioscincus , and Rhodona are each divided between the Oriental and Australian Regions but , like some agamids named above , are absent from parts of the intervening archipelago ; Emoia and Otosaurus , on the other hand , are almost entirely or completely confined to the islands , from the Greater Sundas to New Guinea . Dibamus ranges from southern Indochina to New Guinea . Monitor lizards ( Varanus ) range continuously ( so far as the land allows ) to Australia , and so do worm  | snakes ( Typhlops ) . The aniliid snake genus Cylindrophis extends from the Orient to New Guinea . The widely distributed Old World tropical genus Python in a strict sense extends to Timor ; this genus in a broader sense reaches New Guinea and Australia . Of colubrid snakes , the following genera extend from the Orient to Australia : four fully aquatic genera ( not counting sea snakes ) , semi-aquatic Natrix , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines to northeastern Australia . Against this list of Oriental ties , Australian reptiles show only one clear case of relationship toward any other part of the world : chelyid turtles occur only in the Australian Region and South America . Some Australian geckos have been thought to be directly related to South African or American ones , but these cases are doubtful . The transition of the Oriental and Australian reptile faunas is too complex to describe in more detail here ( many details are given by Rooij 1915 ? 1917 and Mertens 1930 ) . Examples are given above of families , genera , and species that range continuously from Asia to Australia , of groups that occur in both regions but are absent on intervening islands , and of groups that are confined to the islands . There are also many Oriental reptiles that stop at Wallace 's Line , and many others that extend for varying distances toward the Australian Region but do not reach it . In short , much of the Oriental reptile fauna extends toward Australia , with progressive subtractions increasing with distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat fewer , Australia , and still fewer , Tasmania ; but the pattern is complicated by discontinuities in some groups and by endemic groups localized in the zone of subtraction . There seems to have been a great but very complex flow of reptiles from the Orient toward and into the Australian Region . But the movement seems to have been almost all in this one direction . There seems to have been little opposite movement , of Australian groups such as chelyid turtles , pygopodid lizards , and Australian elapid snakes toward the Orient : of these groups , only a few of the snakes extend west even to the Moluccas . The South American reptile fauna consists of Chelydra ( in the northwestern corner of the continent ) and Kinosternon , two non-endemic genera of emydine turtles , Testudo , and both pelomedusids and chelyids ; many iguanids , many geckos , a single non-endemic genus of skinks , many teiids , many amphisbaenids , and some anguids ; and both families of worm snakes , an aniliid , boines , many colubrids ( especially primitive ones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snakes , and pit vipers ; and crocodiles and caimans . This fauna is , of course , not evenly distributed ( but the details of this can not be gone into here ) , and southward it undergoes progressive subtractions , with only a few iguanid lizards reaching Tierra del Fuego . The South American reptile fauna is divisible into two main parts ( Table 21 , p. 563 ) . The older part has probably been in South America at least since the beginning of the Tertiary , when the continent became isolated . The more recent part has probably come since the late Pliocene , when South America became connected with North America . But land tortoises apparently reached South America between times , across the Tertiary water barrier ( Simpson 1943 ) , and some other reptiles may have done so too . That is the sort of thing reptiles do . Most of the more recent members of the South American reptile fauna , including Chelydra , Kinosternon , the emydines , coral snakes , pit vipers , and some non-endemic genera in other families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of them still occur in North America , but a few have already disappeared or are disappearing there . One example is Geoemyda , now in tropical Asia etc. and in Mexico and Central and South America but apparently fossil in Europe and temperate North America ( see list of families ) . Another example is Testudo , now in the warm parts of the Old World and South America north to Panama ( and on islands ) ; but Testudo was in North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene . Sihynophis in Madagascar , the Orient , and tropical America and Trimeresurus ( including Bothrops ) in southeastern Asia and tropical and subtropical America probably passed through North America too . Mabuya , the only genus of skinks in South America , is in the Old World as well as the New World tropics . It too may have dispersed through the north , or it may have reached America across the Atlantic ; skinks have great powers of crossing water . The occurrence of Mabuya over the West Indies and the existence of an endemic species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the point of arrival of the genus in America , and that it may have come from Africa on drift . Certain genera of geckos , which are even better water crossers than skinks , may be common to the warmer parts of America and the Old World , and they too may have crossed the Atlantic ( see especially Tarentola in list of families ) . The older groups of South American reptiles , marked by generic endemism , have diverse geographical relationships . Aniliid snakes and also the colubrid subfamilies Xenoderminae and Pareinae plus  | Dipsadinae link South ( and in some cases Central ) America with the Orient . Pelomedusid turtles are now shared with Africa and Madagascar ( Podocnemis , only with Madagascar ) but are fossil elsewhere ; and amphisbaenid lizards and leptotyphlopid worm snakes are now confined to the warmer parts of America and to Africa and adjacent areas , but certain amphisbaenids are fossil farther north . Chelyid turtles are shared only with the Australian Region . Of course some of the older groups of South American reptiles , for example iguanids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has been some recent redispersal of genera of some old families : e.g. , one South American genus of teiids has extended far into North America , and South and North America may have exchanged a few colubrids recently . It will be seen that , in terms of existing distribution , different groups of South American reptiles show relationships toward almost every other part of the world , and this situation can have come about only by complex dispersals followed by complex extinctions . Extinctions in North America have already begun to isolate some more recent reptiles in South America ( preceding paragraph ) , and some of the older groups have evidently been isolated by broader extinctions occurring complexly , on various geographical patterns , over longer periods of time . Complexity of dispersals and extinctions is suggested especially by the present distributions of iguanids and boids ( see list of families ) . Central America has the only surviving dermatemydid ( one species ) and staurotypine ( two genera ) turtles , which belong to groups known fossil in the north , and Chelydra ( snapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pseudemys and Geoemyda ( emydine turtles ) , all of which extend to parts of South America but evidently came from the north . Central America lacks Testudo ( except in Panama ) , lacks soft-shelled turtles ( Trionyx ) , which have been in North America since the Upper Cretaceous , and lacks also side-necked turtles ( pelomedusids and chelyids ) , which have been in South America since the Cretaceous . Of lizards , Central America has many . Some Central American iguanids and geckos seem to have come from South America , but others have probably come from the north ( some of these are mentioned below ) , and at least one genus , the iguanid Anolis , has radiated in Central America and may have dispersed from there . The small family Xantusiidae is almost confined to southwestern North America and Central America . Central American teiids  | seem to have come recently from South America . Central American scincids include Mabuya , which may have come across the Atlantic , and two other genera , received from the north . A few anguids occur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genus of xenosaurids occurs from Guatemala to southern Mexico ; a probable relative is in China ; and doubtfully assigned fossils are in North America , etc. in the early Tertiary . Amphisbaenids seem to be absent in Central America ( except Panama ) , although different genera occur in South America , southern North America , and the West Indies . Of snakes , Central America has representatives of both families of worm snakes ; a localized aniliid ( Loxocemus ) ; bolds , at least some of which have probably been derived from South America ; many colubrids , some of which have probably reached Central America from South and others from North America ; coral snakes ; and pit vipers , derived from the north . Of crocodilians , Central America has Crocodylus , probably derived through the north , and caimans , probably derived ( the recent ones ) from South America . Further details of the Central American distributions of some of these groups are given below as well as in the list of families . For purposes of analysis of the reptile fauna , Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be added to Central America , for they form part of the same transition-relict area . Anelytropsis , anniellids , helodermatids ( Gila monsters ) , and an isolated genus of amphisbaenids ( Bipes ) are confined to this additional area , and the testudinine Gopherus enters it . This Central American-Mexican reptile fauna is notable for three things : it is diverse ; it is transitional ; it includes many relicts . Central America ( without Panama ) and Mexico have ( by present classification ) representatives of 21 families plus 8 additional subfamilies of reptiles ( not counting the marginal Trionychidae and Erycinae ) , against only 18 families plus 6 subfamilies ( not counting the marginal Chelydrinae ) in South America . It is particularly in lizards that the Central American-Mexican fauna exceeds that of South America . That the Central American-Mexican reptile fauna is transitional , with many North American and many South American groups overlapping for varying distances , in some cases widely , is clear from the general composition of the fauna listed above . The transition is too complex to describe in full detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north through all or most of Central America but have not entered South America , or have done so very little , are  | worth itemizing . Chelydra ( snapping turtles ) extends from eastern North America through Central America to just the northwestern corner of South America . Iguanid lizards of the large genus Sceloporus extend from southern British Columbia and southern New York to Panama . Gekkonid lizards of the genus Coleonyx , which probably represents Eublepharis of Asia , occur from the southern edge of the United States to Panama . Of skinks , Eumeces , which occurs also in parts of the Old World , extends from the southern edge of Canada to Nicaragua ; and the great , Old World genus Lygosoma is represented in America by one group of a few species , which extends from eastern United States to Panama . The anguid Gerrhonotus occurs from southern British Columbia etc. to Panama . Of colubrid snakes , Thamnophis ( garter snakes ) ranges from the northern limit of reptiles in North America to Costa Rica ; the widely distributed genus Elaphe reaches Costa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States through Central America to the northwestern corner of South America . Finally , Agkistrodon , a genus of pit vipers which occurs also in Asia , extends from parts of Iowa , Massachusetts , etc. , to Nicaragua . These are not temperate-zone reptiles which enter the tropics on mountain tops . Most of them occur in the tropical lowlands in Central America . The obvious or probable relicts in the Central American-Mexican reptile fauna are the dermatemydid and staurotypine turtles and Gopherus ( which does not represent the same stock as Testudo ) ; xantusiids , Anelytropsis , anniellids , Xenosaurus , Heloderma , and Bipes ; and Loxocemus . Existing relatives or fossils ( see list of families ) show that some of these relicts represent groups that reached the Central American-Mexican area from the north ; some are of unknown history ; none is clearly a relict of a primarily South American group . The transition and the occurrence of relicts in the Central AmericanMexican reptile fauna are partly correlated . Many different groups of reptiles extend into the transition area or have moved through it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of the reptiles that have come northward from South America stop at or near the edge of the tropics in southern Mexico . This is a common pattern , of tropical groups which reach but do not enter the north-temperate zone . But of the many reptiles that have come southward from or through North America , although many have crossed the line of the tropics and spread through much or all of Mexico and Central America , comparatively few have entered South America ; and some of the relicts seem to represent additional , older groups that reached Mexico  | and Central America from the north but did not enter South America . This is not a common pattern among other vertebrates . It has a special significance , which will be discussed in Chapter 9 . Where different faunas of reptiles meet there are not sharp boundaries but broad areas of transition ? overlapping with progressive subtractions . In eastern Asia , where there is complex transition between tropical and north-temperate fishes and amphibians , reptiles simply decrease northward . Many tropical Asiatic reptiles stop short of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is no primarily northern fauna of reptiles to make the opposite half of a transition pattern . For the same reason , because reptiles are few in the north and absent in much of the far north , the temperate Eurasian and temperate North American reptile faunas are now separated by an empty gap rather than an area of transition . However , Eurasia and North America exchanged a number of reptiles ( various turtles , lizards , snakes , and probably crocodilians ) during the Tertiary . North and South American reptile faunas overlap , with progressive subtractions , in Central America and Mexico , and the farthest elements of the overlap go much farther : e.g. , primarily North American emydines reach part of Argentina , and primarily South American teiids reach the edge of British Columbia . Oriental and Australian reptiles overlap in the eastern part of the Indo-Australian Archipelago . The great extensions into and across the transition area are all made by Oriental reptiles , some of which range ( with progressive subtractions ) across all the islands and into Australia , while primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unnecessary . In general , cold is apparently an effective barrier for reptiles . Even moderate-temperate climate is a partial barrier for tropical reptiles . But no part of the world has been cold enough long enough to stop the dispersal of all reptiles permanently . Other kinds of barriers affect different reptiles differently . Dry country is a barrier for water-loving reptiles , wet country for desert ones . Moderate gaps of salt water stop some reptiles but not others . Barriers of all these sorts retard the dispersal of reptiles and stop some of them . But nothing has stopped the dispersal of appropriate dominant groups , such as the Colubridae , over the world .  | The most dominant existing group of reptiles is the family Colubridae , of common snakes . This single family contains about twothirds of all existing snakes and a still higher proportion of those in ordinary habitats , excluding the burrowing worm snakes and the sea snakes . Colubrids are very numerous in genera and species in all the principal regions of the world except Australia , and individuals are often numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they are diverse ecologically , with many terrestrial , arboreal , burrowing , and aquatic forms . They are dominant in both main climatic zones ( tropical and north-temperate ) and in a variety of habitats ; even in the north-temperate zone they are numerous in woods and wet places as well as in open and arid country ; and some of them come near the northern limit of reptiles in Eurasia and set it in North America . The distribution of Colubridae is therefore nearly continuous over a large part of the world , with less regard for climates and barriers than any other reptiles show . All these things together make the colubrids an outstandingly dominant group , comparable in a general way to the family Cyprinidae among fresh-water fishes or the genus Rana among frogs . No other reptiles compare with colubrids in dominance over the world as a whole , although others are dominant in limited areas . In certain areas , for example , emydine turtles are dominant , among turtles . They are numerous in genera and species and also in individuals primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America , but their occurrence is irregular even within their limits of distribution . They are diverse ecologically : different ones are aquatic , amphibious , and terrestrial . The rise and spread of the dominant colubrids presumably had a profound effect , through competition , on other snakes and perhaps still more on lizards : the localization and discontinuous distribution of so many lizard families may well be partly a result of competition with snakes and especially with colubrids . However , there is little actual evidence of this . We do not know how snakes and lizards were distributed before the appearance of colubrids , and we do not know where the colubrids themselves first appeared or how they spread ; the fossil record is not much help . One significant detail is that colubrids and elapids are complementary in their areas of dominance ( not in their total ranges ) , the colubrids in most of the world , the elapids in Australia . If colubrids have not replaced most elapids ,  | they have probably at least limited their radiation outside of Australia . Within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the main part of the world and for more primitive ones to be concentrated in South America and perhaps Madagascar suggests complex competition and replacement in the main part of the world . Clearer signs of replacement in most of the Old World are shown by the complementary distributions of iguanid and agamid lizards , the former in America and relict on Madagascar and Fiji , the latter on the continents of the Old World . And still clearer , because shown by fossils as well as by existing distributions , is the replacement of formerly cosmopolitan side-necked turtles by the dominant emydines in the Oriental Region and the north-temperate zone ( Fig. 29 ) . In the absence of direct evidence , the best evidence of competition between different groups of animals comes from the complementary distributions of dominant , ecologically equivalent groups . There is some evidence of this sort among reptiles . If the reptiles show less complementarity than fresh-water fishes and amphibians do , this may mean not that there is less competition among reptiles , but that the reptiles disperse more rapidly and cross barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replacement are soon lost ,  | Summary : the pattern of distribution of reptiles The main pattern of distribution of reptiles contains the same five subpatterns found among fresh-water fishes and amphibians , but some of the subpatterns are modified or weak . First is limitation : reptiles are more limited than fresh-water fishes or amphibians toward the cold north , but less limited on islands . The subpattern of zonation is modified : reptiles have a zonal pattern of distribution only in that they are primarily tropical ; fringes of the tropical fauna extend northward , but there is no separate , zonal fauna of reptiles in the northtemperate zone . The subpattern of radiation is less conspicuous or more complex than among fresh-water fishes or amphibians . If there is a main center of geographical radiation of reptiles , it is probably the main part of the Old World tropics , which is the apparent main center of distribution of testudinid turtles ( emydines plus testudinines ) , trionychid turtles , scincid lizards , the most dominant colubrids , and viperid snakes . The fourth subpattern , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex among reptiles . There is no single , main pattern of differentiation of reptile faunas but rather a number of separate patterns made by different groups , each covering much or all of the world . Turtles make a complex , world-wide pattern of their own in which ( setting aside the complexities ) the main differentiation is between an emydine fauna in Eurasia and North America and a side-neck fauna on the southern continents . Among agamid-iguanid lizards and also boid snakes the main differentiation is between the Old and New Worlds . Among colubridelapid snakes , the main differentiation is between Australia and the rest of the world . Other , smaller groups of reptiles , with their own patterns , multiply the complexity . The fifth subpattern , of concentration in large and favorable areas and subtraction marginally , is weaker among reptiles than among fresh-water fishes and amphibians . Reptiles are primarily land animals , and they occur in numbers almost everywhere on land except where it is too cold for them . However , reptiles are concentrated in warm places , and special groups are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lizards tend to be concentrated in open , sunny places . Turtles tend to be concentrated in large areas which are favorable for them : e.g. , emydines in eastern tropical Asia and eastern North America . However , most reptiles are not so concentrated . Where different faunas of them come together , there is usually complex transition of many groups in a wide area .   The place of relicts in the main pattern of distribution of reptiles is this . Turtles as a group are relict . They have existed with little visible change since the Triassic . They are most diverse in the tropics , but some occur far into the north-temperate zone . Crocodilians too are relict as a group ; they date from the Triassic and are the only surviving archosaurians . They are now all in or near the tropics . Sphenodon , the only surviving rhynchocephalian , isolated on New Zealand , is a phylogenetic and geographical relict , but it stands alone . No other ancient reptiles survive in geographical isolation . Australia is not now a refuge for any especially archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineage of turtles ( see list of families ) , survived there until the Pleistocene . History of dispersal of reptiles The present pattern of distribution of reptiles has evolved in a very complex way , even more complex than among fresh-water fishes and amphibians , by evolution , radiation and dispersal , adaptation , competition , limitation , retreat , etc. , of many different groups . The actual pattern formed has been determined by the nature of reptiles ( especially by the facts that they are primarily land animals , that they prefer warm places but can enter cool ones temporarily , and that some of them disperse rapidly and cross barriers easily ) and by zonation of climate and by other controlling factors of the world . The movements of the main groups are worth tracing , so far as they can be traced . Here , only existing groups and related fossil ones will be considered , and only their major movements during the Tertiary , or not long before . The Mesozoic dispersal of dinosaurs is treated briefly in Chapter 10 . The histories here outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list of families for details and clues on which the histories are based . Of turtles during the Tertiary , common turtles ( emydines ) have radiated in tropical Asia and spread from there through the northtemperate zone and to South America etc . Land tortoises ( Testudo etc. ) , presumably derived from emydines in Asia , have spread over most of the warm parts of the world except Australia . Testudo apparently reached South America in the Miocene , emydines perhaps in the Pliocene . Soft-shelled turtles ( Trionyx ) apparently spread from the Old World tropics to eastern Asia and North America , but this was only a late movement in a complex , pre-Tertiary dispersal of trionychids . And musk and snapping turtles ( chelydrids ) have extended from North to South America recently . On the other hand ,  | side-necked turtles ( at least pelomedusids ) have withdrawn from Eurasia and North America ; dermatemydids have withdrawn from north-temperate regions and have been reduced to one species in Mexico and Guatemala ; and chelydrids have withdrawn from temperate Eurasia ; and the last meiolaniids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared . Of lizards , there seem to have been few recent exchanges between the Old and New Worlds . Skinks have apparently extended from the Old World to America : Eumeces and Lygosoma through the north to North and Central America , and Mabuya perhaps across the Atlantic from Africa to tropical America . The gekkonid genus Tarentola may have crossed the Atlantic to the West Indies . Only a few other genera of lizards are common to parts of the Old and New Worlds , and their histories are doubtful . Agamids have radiated on the continents of the Old World and have apparently replaced iguanids there , but have not reached America . Other movements of lizards within the Old World and also between North and South America have occurred but can not be considered here . As for withdrawals , iguanids have withdrawn from the Old World continents ; some anguids and amphisbaenids have withdrawn from some northern areas ; and varanids withdrew from North America early in the Tertiary . This is about all of importance that can be said of the geographical movements of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with many discontinuities and localizations , suggests that they have retreated more than advanced in recent times . Their retreat may be correlated with the rise of colubrid snakes . Of snakes , the older dispersals ( of worm snakes , aniliids , boids , etc. ) are unknown . ( The supposed replacement of boas by pythons on Old World continents was , apparently , a fiction suggested by faulty classification . ) Common snakes ( colubrids ) have radiated complexly over most of the world . Their place of origin is unknown , but their most recent radiation seems to have been from the main part of the Old World tropics , from which many different genera have spread northward and to America , and a few have spread to Australia . The direction of movement of some of the genera is not clear , but Natrix , Elaphe , Coluber , and Opheodrys seem to be among those that have spread from the Old World to North America . Elapids arose from early colubrids probably somewhere in the Old World . Somehow they reached Australia before colubrids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snakes . Viperids too were probably derived from colubrids in the main part of the Old World ; pit vipers prob- ably arose ( from true vipers ) in southern Eurasia , and two or three stocks reached America , one producing the rattlesnakes . As to withdrawals of snakes , little can be said in detail . Some groups have evidently withdrawn from northern areas , and others ( aniliids , erycine boids , some subfamilies of colubrids ) have disjunct ranges which suggest more extensive withdrawals . True crocodiles ( Crocodylus ) may have dispersed early in the Tertiary , probably from the Old World to America , but this was only the last part of a complex dispersal of crocodilians . Alligator and both existing genera of gavials have evidently retreated . The history of aquatic snakes is worth separate consideration . Various snakes in many parts of the world are more or less aquatic , but three groups of them are more highly adapted than most others to life in water , with valvular nostrils ( M. A. Smith 1943 , pp. 17 ? 19 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homalopsinae , separately derived from colubrids , and the Hydrophiidae or sea snakes , derived from elapids . Details of the distributions of these groups are given in the list of families . All three of them , the three principal existing groups of fully aquatic snakes , seem to have arisen in the same place , tropical Asia and the Indo-Australian area ; probably ( judging from their ancestry ? there are no pertinent fossils ) they arose within the Tertiary or not long before it . A number of dominant reptiles seem to have moved from the Old World to America . They include several emydines , Testudo , and Trionyx ; three genera of skinks ; several genera of colubrids , an elapid , and two or three pit vipers ; and Crocodylus . On the other hand , it is not certain that any reptiles have moved from America to the Old World , although a few may have done so . There are also several groups of reptiles that seem to have withdrawn from parts of the Old World and survived in America : dermatemydid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Xenodontinae " ) ; but varanids have withdrawn in the other direction , from North America . Withdrawal is not the same as spreading but may be correlated with it : withdrawal of some groups may be caused by spreading of others and may proceed in the same direction . All these cases together do not amount to proof , but they do suggest a tendency for reptiles to move from the Old World to America more than the reverse . Moreover , reptiles are primarily tropical animals which often invade the north-temperate zone but usually do not do well there . And reptiles seem to have spread from the main area of the Old World toward Australia ( see p. 193 ) . This leaves the main part   of the Old World tropics , Africa plus tropical Asia , as the apparent main center of geographical radiation of reptiles , so far as there has been a main center . There are at least indications that successive groups of dominant reptiles have risen and spread from there , as successive dominant groups of fresh-water fishes and frogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell much about ancient lands and climates , and what they do tell is best carried over to Chapter 10 . However , a few special cases are collected here for reference . Pelomedusid turtles and amphisbaenid lizards are completely confined , or nearly so , to Africa and warm parts of America , but fossils suggest that they dispersed through the north . Leptotyphlopid worm snakes , also mostly African and American , may have done so too . The lizard genera Mabuya and Tarentola may have reached South America or the West Indies directly from Africa , but not necessarily by land ; they may have crossed the Atlantic on drift ; they belong to families that are notorious for water crossing . Chelyid turtles occur only in South America and the Australian Region and are unknown elsewhere even as fossils . In South America they are almost entirely confined to the tropics and do not reach the cool southern extension of the continent . In the Australian Region they occur in both tropical and temperate areas , but not on Tasmania , and not on New Zealand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution is not matched by fresh-water fishes or any other aquatic vertebrates . They have probably dispersed in some unusual way , perhaps through the sea from South America to Australia . The distribution of chelyids is paralleled by extinct meiolaniid turtles . These turtles occurred in southern South America about the beginning of the Tertiary , and on eastern Australia , Lord Howe Island , and Walpole Island southeast of New Caledonia in the Pleistocene , but their record is blank for the intervening 50 million years or so , and they are unknown elsewhere at any time . They were giant land turtles , but several facts suggest that they could disperse across the sea . First , in South America they occurred with early placental mammals , which did not reach Australia , as if the turtles crossed a barrier which the mammals could not cross . Second , Lord Howe and Walpole Islands ( and also New Caledonia ) are biologically oceanic islands , which lack strictly fresh-water fishes , amphibians , and terrestrial mammals . That the turtles occurred there in the Pleistocene is almost proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , existing land tortoises , the ecological counterparts of meiolaniids ,  | have crossed ocean gaps hundreds of miles wide . Matthew ( 1915 , p. 283 ) long ago suggested that meiolaniids crossed the ocean barriers between South America and Australia , and this is probably still the best guess to account for their distribution . The common factor of all these histories is that they account for the distributions of different reptiles without resorting to special land bridges or continental drift . In conclusion , I see that I have been able to do less with reptiles than with any other vertebrates . The distributions of fresh-water fishes and amphibians , though complex enough in detail , form comparatively simple , very significant main patterns . The distribution of birds is very complex , but birds are the best-known animals and their distribution has special points of interest . The distribution of mammals , backed by their fossil record , is most significant of all . But existing reptiles have a complex distribution which is particularly difficult to reduce to main patterns , movements , and significances . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
