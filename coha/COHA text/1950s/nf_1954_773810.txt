txt // holy quorum ( choros ) of the Apostles had ended their lives in various ways , and that generation passed away of those who had heard the divine wisdom with their own ears , at that mo-ment the conspiracy ( systasis ) of godless error took its rise through the deception of false teachers who , as soon as the last Apostle had departed ( or , since there were no longer any Apostles left ' ) , first came out openly and henceforward under-took to match the teaching of the truth with what they falsely styled Gnosis . " ' Note it well : as long as there were living Apostles these impostors had been kept in their place by apostolic authority . As long as people were still alive who had actually heard the preaching of the Lord , these deceivers could not claim to have it but lurked in dark corners biding their time . And that time came ! As soon as the apostolic generation passed away the barriers of apostolic authority were removed ; the deceivers had nothing to fear ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else-where ; they sprang up like mushrooms , says Irenaeus , and operated with complete impunity and immunity . ' Where , then , were the successors of the Apostles who should have kept them in their place and continued to wield the authority which had so long overawed them ? That authority was not there , and the church found itself in a serious predicament , a predicament fully set forth by Irenaeus in his work on the Gnostics . " Many , " he says in his introduction , " are bringing in false doctrines , making convincing noises . . . taking liberties with the logia ( that is , the written sayings ) of the Lord , having become bad interpreters of the good and correct word . And they turn many aside , persuading them that they have the Gnosis from Him who planned all things and orered them , and so are able to teach higher and greater things of God who made the heavens , the earth and all that in them is . They argue very convincingly because of their training with words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as working inside the church as regclar members , wolves all but in indistinguishablefrom the sheep , " making what they say appear truer than truth itself . " From this it is evident that the Gnostic teaching was not particularly strange // and exotic ; that it was so Christian as to fool the most ortho-dox ; that it dealt with the mysteries of the universe ; and that it purported to come from Christ himself . Nearly all studies of Gnosticism in the past have sought the key to its origin and nature in the original sources of vari-ous Gnostic doctrines . Thus some scholars have maintained that Gnosticism is simply the adoption by the church of Greek philosophy ; others say it is a typically Jewish production ; others have claimed to find its origin in Egypt , Asia Minor , Babylon , Samaria , Persia , and India . Opinions differ as wide-ly today as ever . ' It is as if various parties called upon to describe the nature of a bucket were to submit careful chemi-cal analyses of all substances carried in buckets : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bran school , etc. , each defining buckets in terms of a particular content . The im-portant thing about the Gnostics is not that they adopted doc-trines and practices from Iran or from Alexandria , but that they showed a desperate eagerness to latch on to anything that looked promising no matter where it came from . Irenaeus ' survey of those practices and doctrines easily explains this urgency : the Gnostics had caused an immense sensation and gained a huge and growing following by the electrifying an-nouncement that they had the gnosis , revealed knowledge , the wonderful things that the Lord taught to Peter , James , and John after the resurrection . Having made the claim they were , so to speak , " on the spot . " They had to deliver ? they had to come through with something wonderful , supernatural , which at the same time would correspond in some degree to wide-spread rumors and traditions in the church as to what the gnosis really was . And so they welcomed any teaching or practice that combined an air of mystery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , God was something beyond the grasp of ordinary Christians ; they gave secret lessons and charged money for them ; they built up elaborate philosophical systems based on abstract and personified con-cepts ; they practised ordinary magic and specialized in trick miracles such as changing wine into blood ( all this according // to Irenaeus ) ; they tried to produce supernatural experiences by the use of drugs and stimulants ; they cultivated a large vocabulary of fancy technical words to impress the public ; they made a big thing of numerology ; they brought forth li-braries of faked apocryphal writings to cause a sensation ; they parodied celestial marriage and baptism , while teaching that water baptism was not necessary since the spirit is every-thing ; they said it was impossible for the body , since it is made of earth , to participate in salvation ; they condemned marriage ; they practised extreme unction ; they taught transmigration of souls ; they venerated holy images , in particular a portrait of Christ . These are a few of the things charged against them by Irenaeus . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to give the impression that the powers and gifts and knowledge of the ancient Apostles were still on the earth , for that is what they claimed to have , but did not have . " This much is known for sure about the Gnosis , " writes Quispel , the present-day leader of Gnostic studies , " that we may say with confidence , that the proportion of nincompoops and crackpots ( stoethaspels en warhoof den ) was greater among them than elsewhere.71 ' And yet what a lot of stuff intro-duced by them was preserved by conventional Christianity ? a most suspicious circumstance ! The Gnostic experiment proved a number of important things . First , that the gifts of the spirit can not be faked . The Gnostics made desperate and determined efforts to display the powers that the Apostles had once enjoyed , but after the passing of the talented and enthusiastic first generation ? the school of Simon Magus ( who , you will recall once tried to buy the power of the priesthood from Peter ) ? they fell back on the safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recondite enough to satisfy the church . Eusebius has preserved from a number of sources the pathetic attempt of Montanists to keep alive the gift of prophecy , a project which was finally given up in despair after the death of the Lady Maximilla.11 In the second place , the Gnostic affair of the second cenPROPHETS // tury showed how terribly hungry the Christian world was for the spiritual gifts . They yearned for prophecies , tongues , and the marvellous gnosis , and they never stopped yearning even after the Gnostics had been reabsorbed into the main church . A number of recent studies have shown the tendency of Gnosti-cism to pop up in every century , only to be discredited when the claims put forward were found to be unsubstantiated , 1z for the third and most significant point proved by the Gnostic experience was that the main church was not able to satisfy the demand for spiritual gifts . Irenaeus himself can make fun of all the silly pretentions of the Gnostics , but he is every bit as pitiful and frustrated a figure as they when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false gnosis would n't have stood a chance against the true one which was conspicuously not there to set up against it . As Neander pointed out long ago , to meet the gnosis-so-called , the chuch had to invent another gnosis , which it then claimed to be the ancient one.13 But it was much too late to regain or claim ancient gifts that one had already denied , and it is not surprising that in setting up its counter-gnosis the main church imitated her rival all down the line . They end up resembling each other exactly . " It is by no means a para-dox , " says Harnack in concluding his study of the sub-ject , " when one maintains that in Catholicism Gnosticism .. . won half a victory.714 The only trouble with Gnosticism , Harnack explains , is that it was ahead of its time , and the problem of the Gnostics was solved when the rest of the church finally caught up with them and adopted their way of thinking.15 Certainly it is a remarkable thing that there never was a formal condemnation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there certainly would have been if any Apos-tle or the equivalent in authority had been alive . There was no general council held to consider this greatest and most dangerous of all heresies ? because there was nobody to call // one . Self-appointed defenders of orthodoxy , such as Irenaeus describes himself to be , " could only oppose the Gnostic doc-trine with a new doctrine of their own , and the teachings of lrenaeus himself differ from those of the Gnostics he refutes only in the matter of terminology . Their Propator is his God by another name ; their Pleroma is his Cosmos ; what they call the Logos of God , he says , is Jesus Christ , no more nor less ? so he falls in with nearly all their arguments , beliefs , and con-cepts , and the only real argument is about words . The rise , prosperity , and absorption of the Gnostics is one of the most significant commentaries on the loss to the church and to the world of the gift of prophecy . // THE SCHOOLS AND THE PROPHETS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the education business . Everybody went to school , says St. Augustine , because it was the thing to do . ' Education in a sick world became a fetish , and leading edu-cators enjoyed ( and thoroughly enjoyed ) unlimited authority and prestige . The curriculum was highly standardized every-where , and nonconformists were quickly dealt with in a field in which nonconformists are rare enough at any time . Strictly speaking there were not schools , but only the school , the one authorized institution following the one official curriculum . ' One can easily imagine that this overwhelming predominance of an accepted institution of learning led from the very first to conflicts with the church . It was the schoolmen , the " scribes , " who furnished the earliest and steadiest opposition to the preaching of the Master and the Apostles . It was the young fellows from the schools who started heckling Barna-bas in the earliest description of a street meeting that we have after the New Testament , and the questions they shouted on that occasion were the questions which the schools continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking . The early Christians were understandably suspicious of the schools , on which philosophy had put its intellectual stamp , for as we have often noted in these talks , the ancient saints were , to put it mildly , cool towards philosophy . Even so , it is surprising to learn that the Christians had no schools of their own until well into the third century . Justin intro-duced the first regular school earlier , but it was not carried on after him , and there is no evidence that it had any status among the Christians . Certainly the many schools that // flourished in the second half of the second century all found themselves outside the general communion . ' But about the year 200 the schools start to take over every-where in Christian society . In Asia Minor , Palestine , Edessa , and the West , important schools suddenly come into being and a strongly intellectual orientation becomes evident in the church . Incomparably the most important of these new schools was the catechetical school of Alexandria , the true home of conventional Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alexandria and his more famous pupil , Origen . Both these men are typical schoolmen , brought up from infancy in the four walls of an institution from whose authority they can never free themselves . It was Clement 's project to put the intellectual superiority of Greek philosophy at the disposal of the church . The knowl-edge of scientiae humaniores , he maintains , is indispensable to the correct understanding of the scriptures ; " Why , then , should it not be necessary for one who desires to share the power of God to do so by the philosophical contemplation of intelligible objects ? " 4 Clement generously offered to make Christianity intellectually respectable . For him , says Harnack ( upon whom we shall lean heavily in this talk for the sake of safety ) , " Greek religious philosophy . . . was the means of achieving and explaining for the first time the highest and in-most meaning of Christianity . " ' He was all for the church ; he was going to give it a break by lending to it the advantages of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one can imagine how that would have gone down with the Apostles . Such a point of view , really quite naive , was only possible , says Harnack , because Clement missed the whole point of what Christianity was all about , " because for him the heritage of the Church in its totality and in every particular ? with the exception of some utterances in the Gos-pels ? was something foreign . " ' The university was his world , and his offer of assistance to the church had dangerous strings attached to it : " He submitted to its authority , " writes Harnack , // " but could only adapt himself to it after a specific and phi-losophic re-working ( Bearbeitung ) . " ' He would embrace the teachings of the church , but only on his terms . He would take the literal Christianity and " spiritualize " it . Photius says Clement can not possibly have believed in a real incarna-tion , for example . ' As a member of the church in good stand-ing and as one careful to quote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do ? he saw no reason why he should not go all the way in giving the Christian mes-sage a new intellectual stature that would recommend it to the more educated classes . His slogan was " all truth belongs to the Gospel , " 9 which he took as a franchise not to accept the gospel as the guide to his studies , but to use his studies to establish for the first time the really deep and inner mean-ing of the gospel . Firmly convinced that what he had learned in school was the truth , and that all knowledge is revelation ( following Plato ) , he proceeded to re-edit the gospel to some-thing nearer to his heart 's desire : " The total revamping re-coining , Umpragung of the Christian heritage into a Hellenic religious philosophy on a historical foundation can not be denied , " says our authority Harnack . And what remained of Christianity after that , aside from some of its practical and sentimental appeal ? he asks , and gives an almost shocking answer : Bin Phlegma ? a sediment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Christian . " ' Yet Clement was a moral and an earnest man , the first great teacher of the Catechetical School of Alexandria , the school that was to have more influence on the making of Christian doctrine than all the rest put together . Now Clement of Alexandria with his training and his eager project of helping the church out of its morass of old-fashioned ideas and childish literalism was not a new phe-nomenon in the church . It was just his kind that the Apostolic Fathers had opposed with all their energy . Paul had known them very well in his day ? these over-clever men who wanted to " turn the truth of God into a fable , " who denied the literal resurrection , who claimed that they and they alone knew the // real Christ ( " lo , here is Christ , and to here ! " ) , and who falsely claimed to possess the gnosis . Clement was actually one of these : he emphatically does claim to have the true gnosis , and he defines the substance of that gnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him is revela-tion . " All students of Clement have recognized strong Gnostic elements in his writings . In him Gnosticism wins half a victory . The doctrine which Clement thought an improved Christianity was , to use Harnack 's expression , at least half an enemy of the church . How , then , was it possible for him to " get away " with so much ? We explained that in the last chapter : In the earlier days of the church he could not have gotten away with it because of the presence of the Apostles and their disciples in the church . These men actually had the fulness of the gospel , and everybody knew it . The church was their doing . To put forward a feeble imitation as the original teaching entrusted by the Lord to the Apostles while those Apostles were still alive was obviously out of the ques-tion . The same liberty that allowed the Gnostics so-called to come out openly with their monstrous pretensions " upon the death of the last Apostle , " allowed men like Clement ? semi-Gnostics at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that the prosperity of the Gnostics is matched by the sudden blossoming of the schools everywhere , and especially that of Alexandria . " Alexandria , " wrote Baur , " the fatherland of the Gnosis , is also the birthplace of Christian theology , which in its earliest form was meant to be nothing but a Chris-tian Gnosis . " 12 Clement is completely overshadowed by his pupil Origen , next to St. Augustine alone , the most influential thinker of the Christian church . " Origen created the doctrinal theology of the Church , " writes Harnack.13 Not Christ , not the Apostles , but Origen . " Among the ancient Greek writers of the Church , " writes Delarue in the Patrologia , " there is possibly none who has left to posterity such a reputation for learning as Origen . " Jerome notes that his reputation was as greaC among the pagans as among the Christians.14 In his time , he // was indisputably the foremost authority in the church on doc-trine ; the greatest bishops eagerly sought his counsel and in-struction ; his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information poured in on him at such a rate that we are told he kept seven secretaries , shorthand experts , busy night and day taking down the answers he dictated to all parts of the world . " Like his teacher , Origen betrays strong Neoplatonic and Gnostic leanings . Like Irenaeus he ends up using the argu-ments and language of those he attempts to refute , and like all the schoolmen of the time he is more than a little em-barrassed and ashamed at the unsophisticated and unphilo-sophical nature of the faith of his simpler brethren . I think this embarrassment is best expressed by Origen 's contemporary Minucius Felix , whose Christian apologist , Octavius , goes to considerable pains toi make clear to his educated pagan op-ponents that they have really misunderstood Christianity by judging it from the behavior and beliefs of the ordinary mem-bers and officers of the church . All Christians are not like that , he explains . Cultivated Christians really think just like cultivated heathens , so that " anyone would think either that present-day Christians are philosophers or that the philos-opers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them , and just as the ignorant pagan masses tell child-ish and superstitious tales and believe them , so do the common run of Christians . The real difference after all is not between Christian and pagan but between the educated and the un-educated.16 The story of Moses seeing God is for Origen sim-ply " one of those old wives tales , " and if you take it serious-ly , he says , you " run into the absurdity of saying that God is corporeal , " a thing which any pagan philosopher could tell you is just too silly for words . " Harnack has an interesting reflection on this " spiritualizing " of Christian teachings by Origen : " No one can deny , " he says , " that this kind of flight from the world and possessing of God contains in itself a specific secularization Verwelthchung , lowering to world-ly standards of Christianity . " 18 Most people have always // been taught that the opposite is the case ; that to move from realms of literalism to those of spiritual abstraction is a sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Christian and pagan thought as Harnack does it is painfully clear that the spiritual abstractions were the daily bread of the pagan schools and had been for more than 500 years , while the real and the literal was the very thing that gave Christianity its peculiar stamp and its unique appeal . Spiritual abstrac-tions were a dime a dozen in the world of late antiquity ; the rolling of eyes , plucking of breasts , and heaving of sighs are pagan gestures of piety ; and the incurable appetite for alle-gory , abstraction , and symbolism was a disease which by Origen 's time had seriously crippled pagan thought . The fact that these things were not Christian does not condemn them , but we can not insist too emphatically that the early Christians had known all about these things and had firmly rejected them . We have the gospel , was their argument , all this other stuff is nothing to us . Then why did the church finally break down and accept it ? And why did Origen go for it ? The answer is clearly set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the First Principles . This is not a work against the pagans but an attempt to find the right track for the Christians themselves to follow since , he says , " There are many who profess to believe in Christ who disagree among themselves not only in small and minor matters , but rather about the great and the greatest matters . " 19 It is the very first principles of the gospel , the foundations of the Christian faith , for which Origen seeks , as he says , to lay down a clear and definite rule on each point . On certain of these things , he notes , all Christians agree : that there is one God , that Jesus Christ was the firstborn of the Father , and that the Holy Ghost comes next in honor . " But it is not stated clearly whether the Holy Ghost was begotten or not ? that we must find out from the Scripture . " The scripture does not tell us in so many words , and so the answer must be carefully worked out " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Again , all Christians agree " that the devil and his angels exist , but why or how or what they are , the church has not made sufficiently // clear ? non satis clere exposuit . " All agree that the world was created , " but what came before or comes after it is not evi-dent in the teachings of the Church . " Even the nature of God 's person " is not clearly set forth in our preaching . " We know that there are angels , but what , how , when , etc. , " is not made adequately manifest and so must be worked out by us by the aid of reason following manifest and necessary con-clusions. " 20 Note well , it is the first principles of the gospel on which Origen seeks light , not trivial and minor matters . He says plainly and repeatedly that the church itself lacks satisfactory answers ; he does not know the answers , and what is more he knows of no one else in the church who does know them . Now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious rebuff ? they could and they had to bring forth faked answers to the great questions of the gospel because there was no one left alive who knew the real answers . Origen 's solu-tion of the great questions is enough in itself to prove that . He started out with confidence that his method and his learn-ing , both acquired in the schools , would be equal to providing the missing answers . But he very soon discovered that they were not , and being both a good and an honest man , he is frank to admit it . Let us quote a few of his final conclusions . " I suppose the Spirit of God is the Holy Ghost , as far as I can understand , not historically or literally , but in the sense of spiritual intelligence . " " As to the possibility of bodies , resur-rected or otherwise , being eternal , he concludes that if any-one can work out a better explanation of things from the scripture , he is welcome to do so.22 " There may be other worlds but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know . If anyone can show me I would gladly learn ... we have done our best : let every reader decide for himself what is right . " 23 On the incarnation of Christ he says , " On this head we shall present our suspicions rather than any manifest affirmations . " And having done so he says , " If anyone can find out anything better , or confirm by more evi-dent proofs the assertions he makes concerning the Holy // Scriptures , let such conclusions be accepted in preference to these . " 24 Regarding the nature of the souls he says , " The ideas put forth by us are not to be regarded as dogma , but more in the nature of speculation and inquiry . " And on the Spirit of God : " And if it is allowed us to dare to say any more on the subject , it is possible perhaps that the Spirit of God is to be understood as his only-begotten Son . " " On all these points and many more , Origen , the fore-most doctrinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no authority ? and this on themes which lie according to his own assertion at the very heart of doctrine , the first principles of the gospel . Origen does not know the answers and , what is far more significant , he knows of no one who does , though he has visited every important churchman in Christendom including the bishops of Jerusalem , Alexandria , and Rome . There never was , indeed it is hard to imagine how there could be , a more zealous , devout , single-minded student than Origen , nicknamed Adamantinos , " the unshak-able . " Born and reared in a school , he was convinced that all knowledge of the gospel could be acquired by study alone and only ended up proving to the world that where there is no revelation there is no certitude. // ST . AUGUSTINE AND THE GREAT TRANSITION Catholic and Protestant authorities vie in proclaiming their incalculable debt to St. Augustine , the man " who laid the foundation of Western culture , " ( Seeberg ) , " who stands between the ancient world and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Church , and the father of Medieval Catholicism , " ( Baby ) , " dominating like a pyramid antiquity and succeeding ages ? among theologians he is undeniably the first , and such has been his influence that none of the Fathers , Scholastics or Reformers has surpassed it , " ( Schaff ) , " the greatest doctor of the Church , " ( Lot ) , " the true creator of Western theology , " ( Grabmann ) , " in whom , in a very real sense ... medieval thought begins and ends . " ( Coulton . ) " His philosophic-historical work remains one of the most imposing creations of all time ; it posits a capacity and originality of mind which none other possessed either in his own day or for a thousand years after , " wrote Alfred Norden . Far be it from us to pass judgment on such a man or his works : we shall consider not how St. Augustine acquitted him-self in his great task , but only what that task was . From what we have already quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies in the final fixing of a new orientation for the Church . " It was to him more than to any other single man , " says McGiffert , " that the spirit of classical antiquity gave way to the spirit of the Middle Ages . " 1 " The Christian theology and philosophy of the Middle Ages , " according to Grabmann , perhaps the foremost authority on that subject , " is in form and content almost exclusively Augustinian until late in the 13th century , " and even then " the world-historical achievement of St. Thomas was the synthesis of Augustine and Aristotle . " ' For the medievalist Coulton , Augustine is " the man who closes ancient thought and begins medieval thought . 113 " It is he , " writes Ferdinand Lot , " who set the // Church irresistibly on the course which she has followed to the modern era . " 4 " Upon Augustine , Petrarch and the great masters of the Renaissance formed themselves , " says Harnack , " and without him Luther is not to be understood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time the only Father of the Church from whom Luther received any effective teaching , or whom the Humanists honored as a hero . " ' Many have called St. Augustine the first man of the modern world ; the historian Troeltsch calls him the last man of the ancient . Apparently Augustine is to be respected before all things as that rarest of all humans , a founder and creator . Grabmann says he was " the true creator of the theology of the West , just as Origen was the founder of the speculative theology of the Orient . Troeltsch also describes Augustine as continuing the work that Clement of Alexandria and Origen had under-taken two centuries before . ' The names of Origen and Aug-ustine are often linked together , and with good reason . For each devoted his life to the same project , namely , the working out of a Christian theology which he personally could accept . We have already talked about Origen 's allegiance to the schools and how it conditioned and inspired his whole effort to develop a theology that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even more a child of the schools than Origen , who was a far more austere and independent character . For twenty years Augustine absolutely refused to accept the Christianity learned at his mother 's knee , however powerful were his sentimental attachments to it , because , as he explains at great length in the Confessions , it simply could not stand up to the arguments of the schoohnen . He tells us how in his youth after reading Cicero he would laugh at the prophets , " and how from the very first the pagan schools had taught him to abhor any suggestion that God might have a body ? it was instruction like that , he says , that convinced him that the Christians could not possibly be right . ' And this // is the significant point : Augustine never changed the ideas and attitudes he acquired in the schools . He did not turn away from them back to Christianity ; rather he built them firmly and finally into the structure of Christianity before he would accept it . He never came around to accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged the Christians , nor on the other hand did he ever swerve in his allegiance to the Platonists . According to Professor Grabmann , the whole explanation of Augustine 's " tremendous influence on the scholasticism and mysticism of the Middle Ages , " lay in the single fact of his being " the greatest Christian Neoplatonist , " whose life 's work was " the christianizing of Neoplatonism . " " Augustine has described as few others could the tension and agony of a twenty-year deadlock , " a struggle within his breast , " Grabmann calls it , between the teachings of the schools and the teachings of the Christians . In the end some-thing had to give way ? and it was the church . It was Aug-ustine , in Lot 's words , who " set the Church irresistibly on the course " which she was to follow for the future ; it was not the Church that drew Augustine into her orbit . Or rather let us say this is the classic problem of three bodies , in which the orbit of each alters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustine , as our experts have declared , brought forth a new Christian theology when he solved the problem of which should prevail , the prophets or the philosophers , by deferring to both ? uniting them into a new and wonderful synthesis which has been the object of endless scholarly pane-gyrics . " Augustine , " wrote Reinhold Seeberg , " laid the foun-dation of Western culture when he fused Antique civilization and Christianity together once for all in a single mighty mold . ' " " Reitzenstein declares that Augustine 's life-work was " the program of a reconciliation of Antique civilization and Christianity , whose synthesis still determines our culture.712 This fusion of the classical and Christian heritages was the culmination of a long process . " All the Christian writers from Justin to Gregory of Nazianzen and from Minucius Felix to Jerome used the classics to explain , to enrich , and to defend Christianity , " wrote Father Combes in his valuable study of // Augustine 's education , and this fusion of classic and Christian " attained its perfection in the work of St. Augustine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Minucius Felix , Christ-ian converts who had been thoroughly indoctrinated by the schools before ever joining the Church , and who remained fiercely and unshakably loyal to the schools to the end of their lives , regarding themselves as the real or esoteric Christians and pooh-poohing the others as an uneducated and uncritical rabble . We have noted already how these men thought their fine heathen educations would be a great boon to the Church . This is the group to which Augustine belongs ; Father Eggers-dorfer has shown how he remained up to the end of his life completely a child of the schools.114 Augustine himself calls the adoption of pagan education " spoiling the Egyptians , " and in his famous de doctrina Christiana , written at the end of his life , he presents his program for sending the Church to school with the rhetoricians and philosophers . In making his perfect fusion of Christian and classic knowledge to produce a doctrinal system which he and his intellectual friends could accept , Augustine , to quote Combes , " uses the ancient theodicy , metaphysics , morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing this , to be sure ; but the protests of his heart are silenced before the implacable dictates of his intellect . It is his desire to endow the Church with a doctrine so solidly constructed that she will never again have anything to fear from her enemies.715 That is a remark-ably revealing statement which deserves some examination . From the first quotation of Combes we learned that the idea of reconciling Christian with pagan ideas was one that had been current among the intellectuals of the Church for a long time ? it was anything but the blinding flash of inspiration that some . would make it out to be : it was in fact a creeping sickness in the Church . The idea of a super-synthesis had become an obsession in the schools , where work on encyclo-pedic summas of all knowledge had long since brought all original research to a complete halt . In his pre-Christian days Augustine had displayed a passion for this kind of activity , // and it never left him . Next we learn from Combes that Aug-ustine was not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He often seems to reproach himself for this . " Why should he reproach himself unless he knew there was some-thing fundamentally wrong about his program ? Monsignor Duchesne opens the third volume of his Early History of the Christian Church with the remark : " In uniting itself closely to the State , the Church under Theodosius was not making a good match : it was wedding a sick man , soon to become a dying one . " 18 We might paraphrase the sentence to read : " In uniting itself closely to the learning of the state schools , the Church under Augustine was not making a good match : it was wedding a sick man , soon to become a dying one . " The two " weddings " are actually phases of the same movement , for Theodosius ' work of consolidation and Au-gustine 's were going on at exactly the same time . Classical learning was a very sick man in Augustine 's day , and he knew it . Many authorities have remarked how the saint constantly denounces the arts of the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been immortalized in the story of St. Jerome , St. Augustine 's great contemporary ( they died but ten years apart ) , who in a dream was chastised by an angel with the awful accusation , " You are not a Chris-tian , but a Ciceronian ! " And after he awoke , Jerome went right on being a good Ciceronian , as did Augustine to the end of his days . In a recent study Marrous has shown Augus-tine 's own education to be that of a decadent age , and has pointed out that the only change St. Augustine made in intro-ducing pagan education into the church officially was to make the courses even more simple , superficial , and stream-lined than they had been , thus contributing to " that lowering of the general level of civilization which already , all around Augustine , announces the coming age of the barbarians . " " Well might Augustine reproach himself for what he was doing ; but he had no choice : " the protests of his heart are // silenced before the implacable distates of his intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire ? Combes continues , " to endow the Church with a doctrine so solidly constructed that she will never again have anything to fear from her enemies . " Never again ? To be sure : in the past the philosophers could pick Christian doctrine to pieces ? they could show you in black and white that God could never have a son , or that , since he was " the totally other , " nothing could possibly be in his image , etc . As Peter remarks in the Clementine Recognitions , Simon Magus could always give him a bad time and usually win the argument ? but that did n't worry him . The ancient saints were not impressed by the pompous schoolmen , because they had their testimonies . It was because revelation had ceased that Augustine was driven to come to an understanding with the philosophers , who were now- feared and respected as possessing the only available key to knowledge . Whence this new attitude , yielding to " the implacable dictates of the intellect " ? The world of St. Augustine 's day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's approval and compulsion had made such a course both safe and popular . But the new Christian world community was not willing to fulfil the conditions necessary to receiving revelation ? not by a long shot . We can best describe the situation by another quotation from Monsignor Duchesne : " Long distances separated them the Christians of St. Augustine 's time from the spiritual enthusiasm of the early Church .... Now everyone was Christian , or nearly everyone ; and this implied that the profession involved but little sacrifice .... The mass of the community was Christian in the only way in which the mass could be , superficially and in name ; the water of baptism had touched it , but the spirit of the Gospel had not penetrated its heart . Upon their entry into the Church the faithful invariably renounced the pomps of Satan ; but neither the theatres nor the games were deserted : it was a subject on which preachers uttered their most eloquent protests , and all to no purpose Augustine himself has much to say on this theme .... Was it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rather the world which was over ? Duchesne , op. cit. , III . 3-4. // coming the Church ? 719 Whoever was winning , in Augustine 's day the people of the church no longer had testimonies : from now on they insisted that the gospel be proved to them by intellectual arguments and clever demonstrations . Augustine himself says he wanted to be sure of its truth as he was sure that four and three make seven ; like Origen , he wanted to put the doctrine of the Church on an intellectual basis which was the nearest thing to certainty that he could ever get . He was , says Arnold Lunn , the well-known English Catholic , " the first of the Fathers fully to realize the necessity for a rational foundation of the faith . " 20 And Professor Grabmann reminds us that in his theological explorations Augustine " had almost no predecessors , and for the most part was the very first man to experience the intellectual difficulties of these questions . " 21 For four hundred years , during which the philosophers constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that their faith should be founded on reason and speak the language of philosophy ! Whence this astounding oversight ? Why must Augustine be the first to see the light ? Obviously , as we have often pointed out on other evidence , the early Christians had a revealed faith and were not interested in things reasoned out by man . Augustine wanted to endow the church with a solidly constructed doctrine , says Pere Combes . Had n't Christ and the Apostles already done that ? It was certainly not their intention to work out a system that would please the schoolmen . Just before he was put to death , the Lord told his disciples not to be afraid , because he had overcome the world . That was as far as the ancient saints would go : they made no attempt to win popularity with those who would not accept the gospel as it stood . The Apostles were instructed when the people would not accept their teachings , simply to depart and go to others ? not to change those teachings under any circumstances into something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Augustine did . He , and not the Lord or the Apostles , is , in Grabmann 's words , " the true creator of the theology of the West . " What a comedown from the days of revelation ! Let us summarize what Father Combes has told us : ( 1 ) Augustine f09 . Lunn , The Revolt Against Reason ( N. Y. , Sheed &; Ward , 1931 ) , p. 6 , ? Grabmann , op. cit. , H , 44. // found the Church without a solid doctrinal foundation ; ( 2 ) he took it upon himself to steady the ark ? but who gave him the necessary knowledge or authority to do it ? Where did he go for his information ? Combes tells us that : ( 3 ) he went to the pagan schools ? he took their theodicy , metaphysics , moral teachings , and politics and worked them into his system . Is that the proper source for Christian doctrine ? ( 4 ) That question worried Augustine too , but ( 5 ) he had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And what was the world clamoring for ? A theology that would appeal on rational grounds alone to a Christian world which was , as Duchesne puts it , Christian in name only , and which had forgotten the meaning of a testimony . The wedding of the sickly philosophy of the fourth century to Christian doctrine could only take place after Christianity had been once for all definitely divorced from the gift of prophecy and revelation . St. Augustine fully deserves his title of the man who changed the whole course of world history and of church history . He found himself in an intolerable situation , and he made the best of it . It is the situation , not the man , that teaches us what hard necessity and fateful decisions faced the Church once the gifts of revelation and prophecy were withdrawn . // A SUBSTITUTE FOR REVELATION St. Augustine 's program was to endow the Church once for all with a solid doctrine that all rational people could ac-cept . We have cited various authorities all of whom agreed that it was St. Augustine who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a new emphasis on philosophy , made necessary by the new and sudden growth of the Christian community to a world church . Christ had said that his sheep hear his voice ? and no others . ' But now the Church , follow-ing the emperor 's example rather than the Lord 's , would speak with a voice that all the world could hear . We have said that Origen 's case proved that " where there is no revelation there is no certitude . " But we have also noted that Augustine 's problem is the same as Origen 's : to achieve certitude without revelation . We are aware of various degrees of transport in Augustine 's writings ? but they are not really revelation . Many have pointed out that when Augustine 's logical quest bogs down he leaps the gap by a kind of in-spiration . He anticipates his answers , says Grabmann " with a purely spiritual far-sightedness , " 2 so that he does not really have to work them out ; where his logic fails , according to Professor Coulton , Augustine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call it what you want , it is not revelation . The most ecstatic period of Augustine 's life were the weeks he spent at Cassiciacum , culminating in what many consider to be his final conversion ; yet of that period Combes writes : " He prays , he meditates , he idles , but especially he chats ; and these conversations , minutely recorded by stenographers ... show that the ideas of Cicero , Plato , and Plotinus still oc-cupy even in his spirit the foremost position , leaving only a little corner . . . for Christian ideas . " 4 We must not forget that various types of ecstasy were carefully cultivated in the schools of rhetoric in which Augustine had been raised , and we meet // them all in his writings . Take this description of a " mani-festation , " for example . He says that as a result of reading certain books of the Platonists it was made manifest to him that things could be both good and corrupted ; this leads him to another logical conclusion and this to another and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceases to be ; therefore things that are are good ; therefore whatever is , is good ; therefore evil is not any substance , etc. " and so after some eighteen " therefores " or the equivalent , he triumphantly announces : " I perceived therefore , and it was manifested unto me that Thou madest all things good . ' This is what the schoolmen would call a manifestation . " Slowness and sinu-osity " are the characteristics of Augustine 's reasoning , accord-ing to Gilson , ' but swiftness and directness are the hallmarks of revelation . The formal ecstasies and intellectual insights of the school-men are not real revelation , and Augustine knew it . In all fairness to him we must report that he would infinitely have preferred revelation to philosophy . Not only did he feel guilty about what he was doing , but it was only after long years of agonizing struggle and indecision that he at last , painfully and with heartbreaking reluctance , closed the book on revela-tion or recognized that he could not open it . " What a differ-ence there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " between the am-biguities of the academicians and the certainty of the Chris-tian faith ! " And yet it is the Academy that he brings into the Church , and without Plato he informs us , his own conversion would never have taken place . ' The Confessions is the story of a man who all his life hungered for revelation ? " here are my ears , God speak to them ! " ? but in the end had to settle for a second best . He tells us of the founder of the state re-ligion of heathen Rome , the great and good Numa , who though he did his best , had for inspiration to resort to hydrom-ancy and the arts of divination . He was compelled ( corn pul-sus ) to do this , says Augustine , because the poor man " had no prophet of God , nor any holy angel sent to him . DivinaA // tion was a poor substitute for prophecy , yet Numa had no other choice . And was that not Augustine 's position ? In his quest for certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothsayers with a determination that moved even his super-stitious friends to merriment , and he continued to seek out the astrologers even after he was a catechumen , a candidate for baptism , in his thirties . ' ? All his life he snatched at straws , condoning such practices as the use of sortes ( divination by the random opening of the scriptures ) and the visiting of oracles as being , if not desirable , at least better than nothing . " The yearning of Augustine for real revelation and the in-adequacy of all substitutes is beautifully brought out in his last conversation with his mother . Here these two saintly people bare their souls , and what they both wish for above all else is a real revelation : what is it like when God really speaks , they ask each other , when he alone speaks , not by any inter-mediary " but by himself , that we may hear his word not through any tongue of flesh or angel 's voice , nor in the sound of thunder , nor in the dark riddle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we only love in these other things , that we might hear his very self without these ? and if this thing could be continued on . . . so that life might be for-ever like that one moment of understanding for which we now sighed ? would not that be entering into thy Master 's joy ? ' And when shall that ever be ? 712 In this moment of frank self-revelation Augustine admits that what he really wants is not revelation that comes by the preaching of men or even of angels , nor that comes through his laborious intellectual demonstrations , nor is the manifestation of God in nature ? the voice of thunder ? nor even the mystic flash of insight which both he and his mother experienced in their last con-versation together , for even then they still " sighed after " the real thing and wondered what it was like . In the 270 letters of Augustine that have survived we see the man at work trying to answer the great questions of doc-trine and administration that should have been answered by the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Christian world , and he answers them as best he can : He // never refers the questioners to any higher authority , even though the cases are sometimes very serious and have nothing at all to do with his diocese ; nor does he personally ever ap-peal to any higher authority , either in administrational or in doctrinal matters , however important they may be . This is not surprising if one knows the situation . " If there had been , in the Church of the 4th century , a central authority recognized and active , it would have offered a means of solu-tion . But it was not so . " Thus wrote Monsignor Duchesne , speaking of the administrative solution . " But it goes just as well for the doctrinal . " There was not there a guiding power , " says Duchesne , " an effective expression of Christian unity . The Papacy , such as the West knew it later on , was still to be born . In the place which it did not yet occupy , the State installed itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emperor , not only in the sense of being professed by him , but in the sense of being di-rected by him . " 14 Many of Augustine 's letters illustrate this point admirably , but we can not go into them . Let us con-sider briefly the doctrinal perplexity and the complete lack of leadership and direction in the church that is apparent in the Confessions . For twenty years at least Augustine was never able to find out just what the Christian church believed . He tells how he went to school as a boy and made fun of the things his mother believed , how he joined a strange Christian sect , the Manichaeans , which enjoyed enormous popularity at the time , and for once in his life thought he knew certainty ; when he left the Manichaeans , he says the bottom of his world fell out , and he spent the ensuing years in black despair ; he joined a group calling themselves the sancti , large numbers of whom were living secretly in Rome ; and all the time his mother kept after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this he could not do because their arguments could not stand up to those of the Manichaeans , from whom in a vague way he still hoped for light ; when he finally became a catechumen upon the urging of his mother and St. Ambrose , easily the most impor-tant leader in the church of the time , he still did not know // what to believe but was " doubting everything , tossed back and forth in it all . " In listening to Ambrose , he says , he gradually came to the conviction that " if the Catholic Church did not teach the truth , at least it did not teach he kind or error I formerly attributed to it.715 Ambrose was another man with a thoroughly non-Christian education who had joined the church by compulsion late in life ; it was he , says Augustine , who " drew aside the mystic veil , laying open spiritually those things which if taken literally seemed to teach perversity. " 16 Perversity to whom ? ? to Augustine and his fellow sceptics in the schools . Ambrose taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish literal-minded stuff in order to be a Christian . But why had he not known that from the first ? He was born and reared a Christian by a singularly devout parent ; now he was over thirty years old and had studied Christianity all his life ? he was anything but stupid : why then had he been so thoroughly convinced that the church accepted the scriptures literally , as he and the other intellectuals never could ? Simply because the Christians did accept them that way . Augustine says he could never accept the Bible until he realized that it was a double book , " so it might receive all in its open bosom , and through narrow passages waft over to thee some few . " 17 After this discovery , he tells us , a great hope began to dawn on him , namely , that the church did not teach as he had always thought it did , " that God is bounded by the figure of a human body . " 18 But why was he so convinced all those years that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest Christian parents and teachers been telling him about God all through his youth and adolescence if at the age of thirty he is still absolutely convinced that the Christians believe God has a body ? " Since my earliest study of sapientia that is , the learn-ing of the schools , " he explains , " I had always fled from the idea that God had a body . ' It was the schools that taught him to do that ; the Platonic God was the foundation of the current pagan instruction , and from it Augustine never freed himself . What he did free himself from was the beliefs of // his mother ? and I can not doubt that the things which he thought his mother believed , after he had had constant and careful instruction from her from infancy to manhood , were what she and her church really did believe . After describing the immense relief that came to him when he finally realized that he might become a Christian without giving up any of his philosophical ideas , Augustine says that he still did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! 20 Could n't the church tell him ? Did n't Ambrose know ? To make a very long story very short , he final-ly got his answer only when God procured for him , as he puts it , certain books of the Platonists . But he still thought that Christ as a man " had a human soul and mind , " while Alypius , his inseparable friend , " thought the Catholics had a different idea about Christ , that no human mind was to be ascribed to him . " Many other people believed as Alypius did , he says , and many didn't.21 Where is the leadership of the church ? Who could really tell him about God ? Like Origen , he searched hard but found no one : in the end he had to work out the solution all for himself ? from the ground up , and the church was only too glad to accept his solution . " Augustine , " says Thomasius , " is the true founder of the speculative theology of the Trinity , 722 which was to re-main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries . Convinced that the highest blessedness de-pended on a true and complete grasp of this mystery , Augus-tine exerted prodigies of energy and genius in trying to achieve it . For fifteen years he labored away at his thesis on the trinity , " without , " says Thomasius , " ever reaching a satisfactory con-elusion.723 Beginning with axiom No. 1 of the schools , the absolute oneness and immateriality of God , he tries to work a threeness out of it by a series of elaborate analogies with the human mind , only to reach the final conclusion that if such a procedure furnishes an inadequate answer , it is at least an answer : Impar imago , sed imago ! 24 The Father and the Son " can not be really different persons , yet neither can they be // entirely the same " ; and " since the Father has a Son , he can not very well be the Father . " Again , Augustine wants the Holy Ghost to be a person , but his philosophical training will not allow it . Here certainly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitutes break down at every point . We say there are three persons , Augustine sums it up , not because there are three , but because we must say something . ( Non ut illud diceretur , sed ne taceretur ) .25 " Thus , " Thom-asius concludes , " this attempt , carried out with such labor and perspicacity by the great teacher of the Church , is only a proof that the Trinity is not to be proven in such a way . " 26 This is the same conclusion we reached regarding Origen , and a confession of Augustine to a friend in a letter reads exactly like Origen 's frequent admission in the First Principles : The friend had asked why , since the trinity are in all things inseparable , Christ alone took on a human body ? " This is such a supreme-ly difficult question , " the saint replies , " and such a very im-portant matter that it can not here be settled by a sententia , nor can we be sure of solving it by any investigation . I make so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate what I have in mind rather than giving an explanation , that you might judge the thing according to your own best understand-ing .... " 27 " Augustine , " says Grabmann , " confronted face to face the hardest questions of Christian doctrine ; those which have presented the greatest challenge to the human mind ; and for years and for decades he worked away trying to solve them . " That authority then lists the most important of these as un-solved , and says , " In these questions and others he has largely failed to work through to full clarity of understanding , and if dark and difficult passages on those themes are found in many places in his writings , he at least showed the way for all later theology.728 Wilhelm Christ in the best-known " standard " history of Greek literature , writes that in the fourth cen-tury , Hellenism forced Christianity to go to its schools ; " Chris-tianity was squeezed into a system congenial to pagan-Greek-rationalist thought , and in that safe protective suit of armor // was able to face up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice its noblest moral and spiritual forces . " 29 How aptly this recalls Father Combes ' declaration that Augustine wanted to give the church a doctrine so strong that she would never again have anything to fear from her enemies . The armor was provided ? and at what a price ! As to the administrative problems with which Augustine wrestled , we can do no better than quote from a recent study by the learned Jesuit , Father Bligh : " St. Augustine provides the perplexing spectacle of an extremely wise and holy man who began by condemning the use of force against heretics , but changed his mind after observing the good effects of coercive measures taken without his approval . . . . Reverence for Augustine , " he concludes , " forbids me to say that his justification of persecution was wrong ; but its fruits were evil in the centuries which followed , and we may suspect that , if he had had as much experience to reflect on as we have , Augustine would have reverted to his first opinion.730 Here two able Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for whole decades trying to work out the basic problems of doctrine and failing to come out with a clear solution , and the other as doing the best in the light of his limited experience to work out a basic policy of Church government ? with unfortunate results . The Lat-ter-day Saints have always maintained that guidance both in doctrinal and administrational matters can come to the church only by revelation . We could n't ask for a better case to prove it than that of St. Augustine , precisely because he is such a good and great man . The better man he is , the better he illustrates the point , which is that no man , no matter how good , wise , hard-working , devoted , and well-educated he may be , can give us certainty without revelation . In Father Bligh 's opinion , time has not vindicated Augustine 's opinions . It has shown that we can trust only the prophets. // PROPHETS AND MYSTICS So far , from the tenor of these discussions one might sup-pose that the only access men have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or philosophy . Such is far from the case : Many types and degrees of inspiration have been claimed by men through the ages , and it is time to discuss one of the most important of these , namely mysticism . Authorities on mysticism are agreed that the thing is extremely difficult if not impossible to define ; yet there is a com-mon ground upon which the experts all seem willing to stand , namely that mysticism is " an intuitive and ecstatic union with the deity obtained by means of contemplation and other men-tal exercises . " That is the definition of Edvard Lehmann , the great Swedish scholar of comparative religions , who finds the mystic experience to be present among people in all ages and in all parts of the world , even among the most savage . ' In the words of another authority , mysticism " under various aspects appears among all races and in all periods whenever religion and the relation of the soul to the unseen powerfully occupies the attention of men . " ' The universality of the mystic experience is matched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth century Persian , a 13th cen-tury French lady , a 17th century Englishman , and a modern Hindu all report certain peculiar and unusual sensations in almost identical words we must grant that there is something behind what they say ; for while any collusion between them is impossible , yet they tell a remarkably uniform story . There certainly is something to mysticism . Is it the same thing that animated the prophets of old ? Is mysticism a form of revela-tion ? Historically and psychologically the answer is a definite negative . Consider the historical aspect of the thing . The very universality of mysticism shows that it is not peculiarly Christian or Jewish , it is the peculiar property of no // nation , race , society , or church . Only by a determination to see mysticism in everything can one detect it in the Old and New Testaments , which , as scholars are constantly discover-ing , are remarkably free of mystic elements . We will recall that it never occurred to Augustine that one might view the Bible as a mystic book until Ambrose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hidden meaning of things which if taken literally appeared to him simply as " perversity . " Taken as it stands , the Bible is anything but a mystic document . How then did mysticism get into the Christian Church ? In the same way it invaded the Jewish ? through the schools . It is a remarkable thing that specialists in describing the mystic practices of various religions ? Hindu , Buddhist , Shamanistic , Taoistic , Sufistic , etc. ? always refer to Neo-platonism as supplying the best illustration . In Neopla-tonism we have the classic meeting ground of the intel-lectual and the " spiritual " quests for God . " The theology of Judaism was studied side by side with the works of Plato and Aristotle , and thus was produced that curious blend of Jewish and Greek thought , " whose classic representa-tive was Philo of Alexandria , the fountainhead of Jewish and later of Christian mysticism . ' It may seem strange that the intellectual and the mystical should run thus side by side in the search for God , but it is really quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Abelson points out in this connection , " possesses a decidedly mystical turn . " 3 And why not ? Posi-tivism is constantly bumping into brick walls , and the mind can only continue its course by repeated recognition of its limitations : these recognitions are momentary surrenders to mysticism , expedient admissions that the mind might move forward even where logic breaks down . Whenever Augustine finds himself in a logical deadlock , he releases the tension by the ecstatic declaration : " Still , I will cling to God ! " after which he can return to his intellectual quest refreshed and relaxed . According to Chapman , a Catholic writer , " The fundamental metaphysics in which the doctrine of Christian mysticism is grounded is Greek rationalistic metaphysics , formulated by Socrates and his great successors , Plato , Aristotle , and Plotinus. " 4 According to the same authority , " Clement of // Alexandria is the first Christian writer on mystic theology , " having taken over from Philo the idea " that God is to be sought , as Moses sought Him , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the cynical Celsus points out , referring to the mystical parts of his writings , that no real Christian would know what Origen was talking about . To this Origen 's reply was what might be expected : that all true Christians are mys-tic . They close their physical eyes , he says , to see only with the spiritual , ' just as he had declared earlier that all true Christians would , if they could , do nothing but study philosophy . We seem to be telling the same story about mysticism that we did about philosophy : The same men are introduc-ing it into the Church and using the same arguments . Why ? Because they all have the same Neoplatonic background . We quoted Grabmann as attributing Augustine 's great influence to the fact that he was " the greatest Christian Neoplatonist , " and along with that his Confessions have been described as the purest mysticism . Anyone who mingled Neoplatonism with Christianity would necessarily have to bring in the mysti-cal as well as the intellectual element , for the wedding of the two is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ammonius Saccus . Porphyr reports that this remarkable man was born of Chris-tian parents but left the Church and returned to the religious practices of the pagan Greeks , opening a school in Alexandria where he laid the foundations of a new interpretation of Plato : hence Neoplatonic ? the new departure from the old teaching of Plato being the doctrine that God is unknowable to the mind and must therefore be sought in the mystic darkness . ' It is a significant fact , and one diligently bypassed by Church historians , that the founder of that school of thought which was completely to remake Christian doctrine was himself an apostate from the Church . Just as he was not satisfied with what he found there , so those who introduced his teachings later into the Church were likewise unsatisfied with what they found ? St. Augustine being the best but by no means the only example ? Neoplatonism whenever it appears in Chris-tian theology is an attempt to improve upon the gospel . // The essentially unchristian nature of mysticism is ap-parent from the surprisingly late date at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Maximus the Con-fessor in the seventh century that " mysticism and dialectics were fused together in their authoritative form , " and " Pseu-dodionysius and Neoplatonism were officially adopted by the Church . " $ The Pseudodionysius , the cornerstone of Christian mysticism , was produced by an unknown writer , probably a Syrian , at the end of the fifth century . From the sixth cen-tury on and for more than a thousand years , the whole Church firmly believed that it was the work of that Dionysius who had been a disciple of the Apostle Paul , and " thus , " writes Har-nack , " Neoplatonism and mystic cult practices were accepted as classic Christian , " i.e. , as part of the genuine apostolic heritage ! ' The writer of the Pseudodionysius , " is influenced , " according to a Catholic authority , " mainly by the Neo-Platon-ist Proclus . . . . He asserts the transcendence of God with extreme expressions , exaggerated from the Platonic. ... " 10 In the opening lines of the Pseudodionysius we read : " Leave be-hind both thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sense and intelligence , and all things which are not and which are , and set thyself , as far as may be , to unite thyself in unknowing with Him who is above all being and knowledge ; for by being purely free and absolute , out of self and of all things , thou shalt be led up to the ray of the divine darkness , stripped of all and loosed from all . " 11 This is the typical language of mysticism . The Neoplatonic origin of Christian mysticism and its late introduction into the Church along with the philosophic substitutes for revelation show plainly enough that we are not dealing with the prophetic gifts of the early Church but a substitute for them . That mysticism is something totally different from the ancient " gifts of the spirit " will appear if we consider its salient and universally recognized character-istics . The foremost present-day Protestant student of mysticism writes : " from the nature of the case this experience of ecstasy // and of absorption is something unutterable and incommuni-cable . . . . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe it . " The mystic , having found God , " can not hint to human ears any descriptive circumstances about the actual character of God . " 12 Of the four marks of mysticism according to William James , the first is its ineffability . " There Is nothing in the mystic experience that can be conveyed to others . According to the Catholic definition , " mystical the-ology " originally meant the direct , secret , and incommunicable knowledge of God received in contemplation . " 14 As against this , the whole calling of a prophet is to communicate the will of God to men ; he is a mouthpiece and a witness , and he tells what he has seen and heard ; he is a man with a message . The mystic on the other hand has no such message : Mr. Rufus Jones becomes positively indignant at the thought of con-taminating mystic purity with anything as crass and tangible as a message . Mystics , he says , " have not had secret mes-sages from sociable angels . They have not been granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have been men and women like the rest of us , " and their mystical experience " is rather an enrichment of the individual mind , an increase of its range and depth , an enlarged outlook on life . . . a heightening of personality . It is much like what happens with the refinement and culture of artistic taste , or with the appreciation of beauty in and , field . ' ' In other words , the visions of mystics are not like those of proph-ets at all . What they convey is not knowledge , says Jones , " but rather an increase of serenity. . . ? 76 Even when mystics do come forth with concrete revela-tions , according to Jones , these " prove always , when they are examined , to have an historical background . " The greatest mystics are bound in their mystic experiences by their social conditioning . Thus we are told that " some of the many con-fusions and apparent contradictions in St. Theresa 's writings may be explained by her having subordinated her own views // to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine a prophet changing his visions to suit instructions ? " While they were persecuting me , reviling me , and speaking all man-ner of evil against me falsely for so saying , " wrote the Prophet Joseph of his first vision , " I was led to say in my heart : Why persecute me for telling the truth ? I have actually seen a vision , and who am I that I can withstand God , or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen ? " Mystics are a more flexible sort . " It seems , " writes Lord Rag-lan , " that mystics are always persons who have been brought up in an intensely religious atmosphere . The actual type of mystic experience is always strictly conditioned . The ex-periences of mystics , however strange they may seem , are never new . . . . Savage mystics and visionaries always have the experiences which they are expected to have . . . . The experiences of mystics are never original . " 18 These generaliza-tions of Raglan 's show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially obnoxious prophet . The dependence of mysticism on the social milieu is further illus-trated by the fact that there are fads and fashions in mysticism . The mysticism of the thirteenth century was very different from that of the post-scholastic mysticism in which a great number of inspired ladies had revelations . In the seventeenth century , mysticism went completely out of favor with the churchmen ; in the eighteenth it took forms of extreme self-dramatization and became a spectacle in literature and art ; in the nineteenth century it almost died out entirely or took the form of transcendentalism ; in the fifth century it was monastic ; most recently " nature-mysticism " has been in favor . The mystics invariably follow the fashion of the hour , both as to whether they should be mystics at all and what form their mystical discipline should take . No such choices are open to the prophet . While the mystic experience itself is ineffable and in-communicable , the means by which it is arrived at comprise a set and established discipline which the aspiring mystic must always learn from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four characteristics of mysticism its esoteric nature , " which can be learned only in silence and subordination at the feet // of an expert.719 The great bulk of mystic writings , Christian and non-Christian , is taken up with discussions of the course of study and action to be followed by any person who would achieve the mystic experience . Elaborate systems of discipline are carefully worked out ; mental techniques must be acquired ; above all , clearly marked steps of progress , usually three ? ( in St. Theresa 's system seven ) ? are set before the student . This disciplinary procedure , the way of illumination , is the chief mark of mysticism throughout the world . Thus in theory the Buddhists deny any but rational and scientific knowledge , yet " where such practices concentration , trances , ecstacies , etc. are found , there is mysticism . ' 720 Recall that Lehman defined mysticism as a " union with deity obtained by means of con-templation and other mental exercises . " This is a totally different thing from the " good works " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what God prescribes for their good , and in return he gives them what he wants to and in the way and the time he wants to . The mystic on the other hand works his way forward to an expected objective ; he knows what he wants , and he knows there is a way to get it ; a tried and tested procedure has been handed down from mystic to mystic through the ages . Earlier we quoted from the Didache the true test of a prophet , namely that if he attempts to teach his gift to another he is not a true prophet . The mystic gift on the other hand must be taught . It is an interesting thing that the Montanists though they practised true mystic techniques were false prophets . They tried to use the steps of the mystic discipline to arrive at the gift of prophecy and of course failed . Though one person can tell another exactly how to have an opium or marihuana dream , he can never tell the other what the dream is like ? he can only wallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great mystics tell us what we must do to have a mystical experience , but the experience itself is ineffable . With the prophets it is the very opposite . The mystic has his experi-ence as the dreamer has his dream ? all to himself . The mystic , according to Jones , finds " in a consciousness transcend-ing images , ideas or states of any kind , a junction of soul-centre // with Absolute Reality ? ' a flight of the alone to the Alone . ' 721 Since we know that the mystic experience must be induced , usually by long years of dedicated practice and determination , and since it is wholly the experience of the Alone by the alone , how can we deny that it is self-induced ? " Introspective " is Dean Inge 's word for it . The mystic deliberately works him-self into a state . This is what impresses students in the extremely un-mystical nature of supernatural experiences in the New Testament . On Pentecost a large group shared a com-mon experience , saw certain sights , and heard certain sounds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mount of Trans-figuration , at the Ascension ? always there was a plurality of witnesses ; always they are surprised by what happens ; al-ways definite things are seen and heard , and definite knowl-edge is imparted to the human race . There was nothing self-induced and nothing expected in these experiences . The Way of Light in the ancient Christian Doctrine of the Two Ways is not the Mystic Way of Illumination : we are told fully and explicitly what it was , namely , the keeping of the Lord 's commandments , the reward being not the sudden flash of mystic illumination nor involvement in the Cloud of Un-knowing , but a strong and steady testimony of the gospel . Not only are the mystics wholly alone in their private and incommunicable inner clouds of darkness , but also when they compare notes , we can never find out where they stand . Of the post-scholastic mystics we are told that " the accounts given by these various seers are impossible to reconcile with each other , " and that " the value of all these revelations varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . De-lusions , " furthermore , " are exceedingly common in such cases , even in real mystics of holy life , and may occur in the case of saints who have insisted that all their words came from God . " We must not deny that they are real , holy revelations , accord-ing to our Catholic authority , " simply because they are mis-taken or even absurd . " 22 But if that is so , what have we got ? The Dominicans , Benedictines , Carmelites , and Jesuits all hold radically different opinions as to who , if anyone , has beheld the beatific vision ; St. John of the Cross , one of the greatest mystics , will have nothing to do with visions and locutions // which he ascribes to bodily weakness , while other doctors of the soul urge such experience upon their disciples as the cul-mination of the Mystic Way . Such mystic revelations we are reliably informed " are commoner in women than in men , and are more frequent in persons of feeble intellect.723 Finally there is the confession so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the words of Gregory the Great , " It is impossible in this life to see God as He is ? that is reserved for Heaven . " 24 What you get instead is such vague expressions as those which Rufus Jones has reverently collected : one mystic feels " an over-brimming sense of presence , " another is " inclosed in a warm lucent bubble of livingness , " another " hires sunshine for leaden hours , " and so forth.25 Plainly the mystics are in a class by themselves , with their big , vague , inexpressible , self-induced , hotly pursued moments of indefinable and incom-municable union with something whose nature totally escapes them . They are a bona fide historical phenomenon , but not necessarily a Christian one . They are a fascinating society , but as unlike the prophets , ancient and modern , as humans can be . When revelation ceased from the Church , an intellectual substitute was ready to hand in the culture and learning of the schools ; the same schools also came forward with a " spiritual " offering which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any scholars will deny that Neoplatonism is the source of Christian mystic theology , Catholic and Protestant , and none will deny that it is a key representative of a uni-versal pagan world mysticism . The gospel lies wholly outside this historical current . It has been restored in these latter days by direct revelation , and has flourished in the earth for over one hundred years , without ever having to draw upon the dubious resources of mysticism . One alone among all the churches in the world since the days of the ancient Apos-tles has been able to resist the blandishments and dispense with even the occasional services of this useful but highly un-reliable discipline . Here we have another most convincing test and vindication of the prophets. // RHETORIC AND REVELATION No less significant than the invasion of the Church by philosophy and mysticism was the victory of rhetoric in the preaching of the word . Again we must turn to the schools if we would find the culprit . By the time the Church was ready to adopt the teachings of the schools , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whol-ly rhetorical . It was rhetoric that conquered and destroyed ancient education . ' In St. Augustine 's day rhetoric had won complete control of all education . When the emperor estab-lished the great state University of Constantinople in 425 , just when Augustine 's work of introducing secular education into the Church was at its height , he provided for one chair in philosophy , two in law , and twenty-eight in grammar and rhetoric . ' Augustine himself we are told " studied it ( rhetoric ) for ten years , taught it for fifteen , and practised it all his life . " 8 What was rhetoric ? Aristotle defines it as the " art of persuasion , " the technical skill by which one convinces peo-ple ? convinces , that is , everybody of anything for a fee , to follow Clement of Alexandria . It is the training and skill by which one can make unimportant things seem important , ac-cording to Plato , or , to quote Clement again , " make false opinions seem true by means of words . " 4 With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sec-ond century B.C. an army of brilliant and high-powered talk-ers , having caught the public fancy as traveling virtuosi , opened schools which in short order got a monopoly of public and private education . Their method of procedure in talking everyone else out of the picture followed a well-defined pat-tern . The first step was to choose some object of science or // art upon which society placed a value and for which it was willing to pay in cash and glory . The subject chosen was immaterial , the teacher of rhetoric boasted , since rhetoric is equal to anything . Having chosen his " field " the student was then introduced to the broad and general aspect of the thing ? the skopos ; detailed knowledge was not the object but only a good grasp of the main idea , the prothesis . ' In a very short time , a matter of weeks , the student would find himself in the happy position of being able to meet the public with a plausible imitation of real knowledge which if it was lacking in depth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the obvious defects in his learning . These added features , which were guaranteed to make the imitation pro-duct more appealing than the genuine , were simplicity , brevity , and glamor . ' Clement of Alexandria , following Aristotle , says that rhetoric " abstracts in a specious manner the whole busi-ness of wisdom , and professes a wisdom which it has not studied . But that sort of thing paid : Boethius of Tarsus , who advertised that he could speak extemporaneously for any length of time on any subject in the world , became the most powerful man in his city and one of the richest in the Empire . Rhetoric , " the queen of the world , " was simply super-sales-manship ; and the rhetorician sought in the end to sell not goods but himself , in the words of Seneca , who repeatedly ad-vises the youth of the land to study nothing but rhetoric since it alone holds the key to success . If you can impress people , rhetoric taught , the world is yours . ' The ancients attributed the founding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that life is too short to be seeking truth the hard way , that brilliant impostor in his hunger for quick and sensational suc-cess saw his way clear : Wealth , fame , and even divinity , he discovered , are the gift if not of heaven , certainly of the general public for the man who knows how to talk it out of them . Empedocles ' pupil Gorgias , like himself a born showman , en-joyed a sensationally successful career teaching rhetoric , which he frankly describes as the secret of winning success by culti100 THE WORLD AND THE PROPHETS vating appearances . In the dialogue named after him , Gorgias is flatly charged by Socrates with propagating a mock philosophy whose aim is not knowledge but the appearance of knowledge . Socrates also foresees that honest study has no more chance of competing with this sort of thing than a con-scientious doctor would have of keeping his child patient , in competition with a pastry cook who prescribed nothing but dessert . As if to prove this point , old Strepsiades in Aris-tophanes ' delightful comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disgust when instead of being taught how to get rich by " out-talking every other man in Athens by ten stades " he is put to work on the problems of Ionian science . What he was looking for was education for success , the very thing that the rhetoricians guaranteed to supply . Lucian tells us that the public simply laughed at the hard courses of the philosophers and went across the street to the rhetorical schools that advertised the same knowledge available in quick and effortless courses with positive assurance of a good job and big pay . ' Rhetorical education eliminated from its cur-riculum everything that the student would not put to direct use in the social situation . Lucian illustrates this with the story of a youth who came to consult the foremost flutist of the day , Harmonides , about taking lessons . A serious pre-liminary discourse by the master on the work , sacrifice , and hardship entailed in mastering his difficult instrument was in-terrupted by the young man who hastened to explain that he was not interested in being a good flute player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flute was not his passion , but a career was , to which the flute was merely a tool to aid him . As their courses became ever simpler , shorter , and spicier ( by the time of the Neoplatonists Proclus and Iamblichus little remains but a violent spicing ) , the rhetoricians supplanted content with glamor which they cultivated with great skill . Psychologists by avocation , they saw that if the lost witless world of declining antiquity hungered for intellectual and spiritual guidance , it was simply mad for entertainment . So with their wonderful art the Sophists , the great traveling orators , supplied everything at once . Performing foxes , a tightrope artist , a fifteen-minute domestic skit , a couple of clowns telling // dirty jokes , and a famous traveling rhetor would make up an afternoon in the theater . In the schools they were sensa-tional . No ambitious youth would think of studying in their time with anyone but Polemon or Stilpo . Topnotch rhetors amassed immense fortunes by fabulous gifts and fees ; their sons and daughters married into the imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while great cities eagerly bade for their services , and the whole world zealously followed every detail of their private lives . ' Never had an edu-cational project succeeded so well as theirs once the resistance of philosophy had been broken by their imitation philosophy . Their schools became the state schools , and all private in-struction was officially prohibited . Every town in the empire kept its own staff of high salaried grammarians and Sophists , and boasted of being a little Athens in its own right . And it was all just show : the deliberate cultivation of appearances as the surest road to money and success . " It is astounding , " writes Professor Schanz , " with what silly stuff the public was fed . " But the public asked for no better , and the rule of rhe-toric was : give people what they want , and you have them where you want them.10 Why have we dwelt at length on this unhappy theme ? Because this rhetoric as we have been describing it was adopted lock , stock , and barrel by the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To become a world church according to Raby , the Christians had to come to terms with the public schools , with the result that " the influence of the schools of grammar and rhetoric is apparent in every page of Tertullian , of Jerome , and of Augustine . . . " and " he cites Norden on how Augustine could pile rime upon rime in an array of parallel phrases , and use all the resources of rhetoric in tasteless profusion . " 11 In the early Church , according to Zellinger in his study of Christian rhetoric , rhetoric was avoided like the plague ; " content was everything while its verbal presentation counted for nothing . " But when the church became the Imperial Church then the " pampered ear demanded of the preacher the same language which it was // used to hearing in the lawcourts and from the rostrum . And the Church gave in , in spite of all theoretical insistence on pre-serving the old simplicity of the gospel . " Y2 In the fourth cen-tury , says this authority , " the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idiom of the sophistic rhetoric . " The process began , according to him , with our old friend Origen , and reached its full development under the great Christian orators of the fourth century . The first and foremost qualification for the office of bishop from then on was eloquentia . " In the middle of the fourth century a complete revolution took place in the language of the Christian sermon , " he writes . " The earli-est Church had preached in exceedingly plain and simple lan-guage , and . . . scrupulously avoided any contact with the ill-reputed rhetoric of the imperial age . " But all this was sud-denly taken over by the Church and , says Zellinger , " along with hellenistic rhetoric and its ear-tickling refinements there were smuggled into the churches the established techniques of applause . Approval was expressed by noisy shouts , hand-clapping , stamping of feet on the floor , jumping up and down , and the waving of handkerchiefs . The sermons were inter-rupted by resounding shouts of True Believer ! ' Teacher of the Universe ! ' Thirteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . ' 3 Augustine 's plays on words , says Norden , the foremost authority on the subject of ancient rhetoric , were eaten up by the general public , and those ser-mons of his that seem " tasteless and contrived to us enchanted the congregation " ; 14 by the middle of the fifth century , he says , Christian rhetoric had reached a permanent state of " absolute inanity . " Augustine and all the great orating fath-ers knew that what they were doing was wrong , and often confessed it , but it was what the public expected and no rhe-torician ever denied the public that . " The age of preachers had begun , " writes Raby , the speech-hungry crowds every-where " waited in tense excitement for the pointed epigram or for the rimed periods which were worthy of their applause . ' The Christian preachers adjusted their style to their audience , // like true salesmen , or true rhetoricians . ' The classic charge brought against the rhetoricians throughout an-tiquity ? one that Socrates never tires of repeating ? was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : their trade was fundamentally dishonest . Of the orating bishops , the glory of the fourth century , Gibbon says , " the true size and color of every object is falsified by the exaggerations of their corrupt eloquence , ' a verdict fully confirmed and illustrated by the works of Zellinger , Norden , Rhode , Raby , and others . The bequest of pagan rhetoric was part of the permanent Christian heritage . " The education of Augustine was , " ac-cording to Marrous , " that of a letter man of the decadence , formed by the grammaticus and the rhetor , with dialectic thrown in . Grammar and dialectic ! But these are actually the foundations of scholasticism ! " 1S Rhetoric was in to stay ; and in two ways the rhetorical school fatally undermined the Christian society that embraced it . The first was by its strong note of unveracity , the second by the tyranny of numbers . As to the unveracity , even the great Cicero had announced that facultas and copia must take precedence over veritatis forma in rhetoric , 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fradulent it is.20 This falseness was , as Rhode has pointed out , inevitable . One was trained to give speeches on great occasions , and to be proficient one had to practise . The rhetorical philosophy of education took to heart the admonition of Aristotle in the eighth Book of the Meta-physics , that " we learn to do by doing . " Accordingly month after month and year after year in the schoolroom and in their field-trips to the forums and lawcourts , armies of stu-dents addressed imaginary nations on the brink of legendary wars or shed real tears for a mythical Hecuba.21 Augustine recalls that his first assignment in school was to declaim the words that Juno would have spoken when she realized her failure to keep Aeneas away from Italy ? to put real feeling into a totally unreal situation , to pour out his soul in a fictive // and artificial crisis . " And in such exercises the secret of suc-cess was before all else to convince one 's hearers that one was " sincere . " Drilled endlessly in this sort of thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong things seriously ; a neat manipulation of words passes as thought ; hackneyed and extravagant declamation goes for feeling . Be-cause of rhetoric , says Dio , words have lost their meaning and all things are thrown into confusion.23 Equally dangerous and equally persistent in the heritage of the rhetorical school is its second gift to civilization : the tyranny of numbers . During those same childish speeches in which he feigned the whole gamut of emotions , the youthful Augustine was , he tells us , in a very real panic of anxiety , knowing the slightest slip on his part might well mean the ruin of his whole career . For the rhetorician the bottom of the world falls out and everything goes black when an utterance fails to " go over . " A mortal fear of failing to please ; a morbid dread of being out of line ; an anxious , hair-trigger attention ( so often betrayed by Cicero ) to the exact volume and direc-tion of applause are the ingrained product of such training . By definition the success of the rhetor is directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering , the greater the authority and glory of the one cheered . This goes even for God described by Augustine as the Great Orator , whose glory is defective as long as a single voice fails to ac-claim him.24 This idea of gloria saturates the world of late antiquity , which was to an astonishing extent preoccupied with theatrical demonstrations designed to proclaim the power and perfection of some earthly or heavenly leader . It receives its fullest ex-pression in the panegyric orations of the fourth and fifth cen-turies in the grandiose , monumental architecture of the period , both of which were adopted whole-cloth by the Church . And why ? Why was this ruinous thing which wrecks all values and confounds reason , which is constantly denounced as a snare and a delusion by the very fathers that use it most , so completely triumphant in the Church ? " Those modest ora-tors , " wrote Gibbon with his usual touch of irony , " acknowlRHETORIC // edged that , as they were destitute of the gift of miracles , they endeavored to acquire the arts of eloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysticism , rhetoric was a substi-tute . The synthetic glory of the panegyrist is , St. Augustine declares , most welcome to the church which needs a spice and vigor in its doctrine that only rhetoric could give2s ? so far had the Church come from the day of Pentecost ! For St. Augustine the Christian orators , properly trained in the schools , speak with the voice of God ; they are angels mediating between heaven and earth ; they are the tongue of Christ , the doctors of the soul , the mountain of refuge , sheltering clouds , nurses of the Church , the feet of the Lord ; they , in short , are hence-forth what the prophets and Apostles once were to the Church.27 To speak in tongues , says Chrysostom ( whose own title means Golden-mouth ) , is not as great as to prophesy , since prophecy is the interpretation of tongues ; but a greater thing than prophecy even is to be able to give a good oration ! 28 This was in answer to people who kept asking Chrysostom why the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an enlightening one , namely that the Church now has rhetoric , which is better than prophecy . John 's own sermons of which , fortunately , a great number have survived , clearly proclaim his intention of making rhetoric do the work of prophecy and revelation . The clarion voice , the waving arms , the flashing eye , the studied poses and sweet modulations , and ear-and mouth-filling words that thrilled the hearers like the clash of cymbals and had just as little meaning , the sweeping robes , the musical background ( a very important adjunct of church-rhetoric ) ? what spells could they not weave ? What multitude could resist them ? St. Augustine himself reports that he lis-tened spellbound to the electrifying sermons of the immortal Ambrose without paying the slightest attention to what the man was saying ; carried away by his words ; as he puts it , he remained indifferent or even contemptuous of their con-tent . Since the fourth century the Christian church has talked with strange voices , the voices of philosophy , mysticism , and 29 // rhetoric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third of these voices , that of rhetoric , was designed for the manipulation of the masses , and has been the guiding voice of the churches throughout the centuries . Like the others it is a substitute for the voice of prophecy . But even more conspicuously than they , its artificial vocabulary and studied delivery , not to mention its fully documented history , proclaim its true origin and its sad inadequacy . If the cerebrations of the philosophers and the fervid sighs of the mystics fall pitifully short of anything resembling true revelation , the careful sound-and stage-effects of the rhetorician are the ultimate declaration of bankruptcy . After attending the discourses of the greatest Christian orators , we can only repeat what we have said before : there is no substitute for revelation . // PROPHETS AND REFORMERS Our text for this discussion is Hebrews 6:4-5 : " . . . it is impossible for those who were once enlightened , and have tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost , " And have tasted the good word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . . . . " At this point we pause and ask the church historians just what is impossible regarding those people who have been blessed with every gift and power that God gives to men on earth ? To our question we receive unanimous and reassuring answer that it is impossible for people once so mightily endowed ever wholly to lose the gospel ; God has not given his greatest gifts to men , we are assured , simply to have them turn their backs on him . Is it possible or even conceivable , the churchmen have asked in every century , that after giving such great blessings and signs and wonders to the Church , God should ever remove his Spirit from it or rather remove his Church from the earth ? Here is the answer of the Apostle ( and the Apostolic Fathers later confirm it with passion ) : it is possible , entirely possible , for those who have received the greatest promises and blessings that heaven bestows to lose everything ; the words of the author of Hebrews are meant as a warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who have once lost those blessings should ever regain them again by any efforts of their own : " It is impossible . . . if they shall fall away , to renew them again unto repentance .... " Our author then compares such people to ground which has become overgrown with thorns and briers . Other land , he says , can drink rain from heaven and bring forth vegetation when the time of refreshment comes , but for that land that was once rich in goodly herbs and then turned to weeds there is no such hope : " But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned . " The Pastor of Hermas reminds the church again and again that after a certain day soon to come it will no longer be possible for Christians to repent or reform though repentance will continue to remain open to the // heathen . There is , we are informed in this wonderful writing , a point of no return for the church beyond which reform will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of Christianity , the German Lutheran scholar Heinrich Born-kamm , has stated in a recent book that there are just two periods in church history ; the first , he says , is that of " Hellen-ization , that is , the absorption of antique sacramental religion into the early Catholic and Medieval Church , " and the sec-ond is the period of " the purging of the Church of these foreign elements following the Reformation , that is , the epoch of recapturing the prophetic religiosity of Primitive Christian-ity.71 Read in the light of conventional church histories of the past , this statement is really quite an astonishing admis-sion : first of the extent to which alien and unchristian things came to displace the real gospel ; and second of the fact that any return to the pure religion of Christ must necessarily be a return to prophetic religion . Can such a return be achieved by reformation ? It can not . For one thing , Bornkamm speaks as if the pagan elements in Christianity were a single concrete intrusion of a foreign body into the organism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one piece to restore perfect health to the ailing system . Yet no one knows or describes better than Bornkamm how long and thorough the process of assimilation has been . The teachings of the schools and the practices of the world have become an integral part of the organism ; they have transformed it completely ; we have already quoted scholars of various faiths who all marvel at the perfect organic union of the Christian and classical traditions into a new and perfectly integrated whole . Could the church suddenly and easily slough off what had been completely assimilated into its very being for over a thousand years , to return again to what she had been before the great compromise with the world ? Can one re-convert a petrified organism that has been transmuted from one substance to another through the centuries , molecule by molecule ? Or , to use the figure employed by the Lord him-self , when salt has lost its savor there is only one thing to do with it ? throw it out . ( Matt. 5:13 . ) To corrupt the gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Church of Jesus Christ may not be changed without being lost and when lost may not be regained by any process of reformation . This is not narrowness or pedantry ; we see it in all our basic institutions . When a language is changed , whether for better or for worse , that language is lost , and the only way we can find it again is to discover ancient and undefiled sources ? all the zeal in the world can never reform us back to early English . A French scholar has recently asked , can we revive classical studies by reproducing " the miracle of the Renaissance ? " The Renaissance was not actually a revival of ancient learning , however , but a wholly new type of learning based on the study of the ancients , and what brought it about was not the work of reformers but the accidental discovery of ancient texts preserved in some purity by centuries of complete neglect . Consider the gospel in this light : When the covenants were broken and the ordinances changed , and the churches taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply no longer there . Today church historians , Protestant and Catholic alike , agree that this was so , and they easily reconcile themselves to the situation by insisting that what took the place of the old church was really something much better , something far more fit for survival in a wicked world , much more available to the grasp and amenable to the taste of the average man . The early Church , they explain , was something hopelessly impractical and of extremely limited popular appeal ; therefore , it had to go ; it was merely a tiny acorn from which a mighty oak was to grow , etc . Well , what interests us here is not their explanation and justification of what happened , but the admission that it did happen . The primitive church was changed , and thereby the primitive church was lost . And to this we add the thesis that such loss was an irreversible process . Reformation could no more bring it back than it could bring back Old English , eighteenth century monarchy , or the thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often come across the prediction regarding the future of the Church that the sheep would turn to wolves . What would they be in that case ? a new breed of sheep ? Not a bit of it : the sheep as such // would cease to exist , however loudly the wolves might continue to call themselves sheep and parade their Christian back-ground and tradition and name . The Lord and the Apos-tles use the examples of the salt that is spoiled , the tares that destroy the wheatfield until they can be burned , the wolves that destroy the flock , and the sheep that turn into wolves , precisely because weeds and wolves , briers , and salt that has lost its savor are things that can never be reformed : they are beyond saving . " In the days of old , " writes Duchesne , " Chris-tians had cursed the Babylon of the Seven Hills ; now they were conquering her and were going to convert her . What triumph could be more desirable ? 72 That was the fourth century view , but , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be converted or reformed . Baby-lon , like the tares and the brambles , had but one fate in store for it ? it was reserved for the burning . It was common for the earliest Christian writers to speak of the Church as a virgin . " Up to that time , " wrote Hegesippus speaking of the end of the apostolic age , " the Church had remained a pure and un-corrupted virgin . . . . ' " Can that status when lost ? and Hegesippus says it was lost ? ever be acquired again ? What about repentance , you ask , was n't Israel , though her sins were as scarlet , to be washed white as snow ? Yes , but never by reformation ? always by restoration . If Israel is ever renewed , it must be by a new covenant and a new Jerusalem ? and such can never be worked out by men here below ; they must always come from above . Such a renewal came in the time of Christ . He restored the gospel to the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions he found there . As a reformer he would have been welcomed by the Jewish and Hellenic worlds , as we have noted before ; reform was in the air , and the early Christians greatly offended by refusing to join in the oecumeni-cal movements of the times . ' Christ brought the true teach-ings of Moses , Abraham , and the prophets ; but he did not ob-tain them by antiquarian researches ; he made no attempt to establish an historical continuity with them , as all the ChrisPROPHETS // tian churches do . What he brought to men he brought directly from the presence of the Father ; that is why it was identical with what the other prophets had received ? not because he got it from them , but because they too had received direct revelation from on high . As Eusebius tells us , in every dispensation the eternal gospel is brought to the earth as something new . We have talked on this before ; what we want to emphasize now is that the Lord never renews his work on earth by reforming old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When God sets up his work in any age of the world he chooses his own instruments , and they are bright and shining ones , clean and undefiled , whether institutions or men and women . He does not leave them to guess and wonder , as the great reformers , Protestant and Catholic , do through decades of perplexity and doubt , but calls them directly from heaven , often as children ? as David , Samuel , Nephi , and Joseph Smith were called ? before they have any knowledge of the world at all . The reformer takes his cue from the world about him ? the prophet never does . The sad state of the world may lead one to call upon God , and as a result God may speak to one directly , but the mere recognition that this is a wicked world and that the divine order is sorely needed in it does not constitute a call from God to establish that order . The Lord chose his Apostles from among men who showed no signs of wishing to reform the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Paul was actually a reactionary seeking to defend the status quo when the Lord called him . A reformer is one keenly aware of the abuses in the world about him , who wants to do all he can to remedy things . Any honest and alert person can discover on every side much need for reform in this dark and dreary world ; and God expects us all to engage in such activities on our own initiative , as did the Good Samaritan . But God 's work is not founded on the wickedness of men . There is nothing negative about it . Who does not know that men are foolish and unkind ? " It needs no ghost come from the dead , my lord , to tell us that . " If the purpose of man 's existence were but to remedy evil , he would be a dependent of the devil . " If the gentiles have not charity , " said the Lord to Moroni , " it mattereth not unto thee . . . . " There is nothing negative in the gos112 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a great deal about the falling away and the loss of the true gospel to mankind in ancient times , let us make it clear here and now that such a teaching is not a part of the gospel at all ; it is not found in the Articles of Faith ; it has no bearing at all upon the plan of life and salvation ; Joseph Smith almost never referred to it . We only mention the great apostasy because it is an historical point on which we are constantly being challenged : " How can you say , " we are asked every day , " that the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the earth if the Christian church has never ceased to be here ? " One answer to that question is found in the activities of the reformers . Let us make it clear that the attempt to reform the Christian church to its lost state of pristine purity did not begin with Luther . In every century since the Apostles men have made determined attempts to reform the church , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely the question : Who has the right to inaugurate reform ? We know who can amend the Constitution , as we know who established it . But with the church it is an entirely different thing . It was established by Jesus Christ personally . If any amendments , changes , or reforms are in order , they should be his doing , but how can that be unless he speaks to men by revelation ? Bornkamm says the Reformation was a return to the " prophetic religiosity of Primitive Christianity . " The word prophetic is significant : Bornkamm realizes that to return to the primitive church is to return to a church led by prophets . That was what the Reformation should have been and tried to be . The first enthusiasts of the Reformation , as of many earlier reformations , wanted before everything to get right back to the prophets ? not just to reading them , but to enjoying the actual gift of prophecy itself . And so we have such determined and enthusiasic men as Thomas Muntzer , Karlstadt , and Sebastian Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wider die himmlischen Propheten , " ? Against the Heavenly Prophets . His objection was not that there should be no prophets , but simply that these men were not prophets ; with characteristic honesty he saw that the mere recognition of the fact that prophets are necessary does not authorize one to be a prophet . Luther himself was very cautious on this head ; he " did not want a schism in the // Church , " writes Bornkamm , but the renewal of the Church of Christ . . . . He deliberately put off giving new orders to the renewed churches , and he never felt that he himself was called to give such orders . " He actually waited twenty years " before he admitted in the important writing , Concerning Councils and Churches ( 1539 ) , that the movement which he had inaugurated was not a provisional thing pending the general reform of the Church , for which he hoped , but was itself that reform . " ' Luther hoped for action by a general council . But what is the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the councils , von Hefele , the Catholic Bishop of Regensburg , shows that the question of whether even an oecumenical council is under the direction of the Holy Ghost has never been definitely settled . Luther 's reform was promptly followed by a thoroughgoing reform of the Catholic Church itself ? and that again was the work of a council , one of the most famous of all councils , the Tridentinum , at which the French and Spanish clergymen were alarmed and incensed over the claims to authority put forth by the Italians ? even there the issue of authority was not clear . Today it is admitted throughout the whole Christian world , and more so every day , that " a plurality of churches contradicts the fundamental nature of a religion that claims that absolute truth which alone is commensurate with the character of a revealed religion . The true revealed church can only be one ; but reformers take many directions , and there is not a single church in the Christian world which is not the product of many reforms ? and the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most thorough re-forms of all . And now a new reform is proposed by which the many should become one : all the Protestants should amalgamate on the one hand , and on the other the East-ern and Western churches should again become one . This illustrates the impossibility of restoring a divinely established system to its state of pristine divinity once men have spoiled it , for the oneness of the Church is original to it , and essential ; it is not a thing contrived or achieved by oecumenical movements and fusions . It is not a unity that men work out in recogni-tion of its logical necessity . It is a thing which is given to // men with the Church itself , by divine direction . If " a plurality of churches contradicts . . . that absolute truth which alone is commensurate with the character of a revealed religion , " such a plurality is none the less implicit in the proposition that reformers as such have the authority to act in the name of the Lord , for if the recognition of evils , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible can authorize one man to step forth and change the Church , they can also authorize another , and there is no end to the doctrines and factions that result . The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is not the product , as are all the other churches in Christendom , of reformation or of counter-reformation ; it is the product of direct revelation only . Changes there must be , but they can come in only one way ? through a prophet of God . // THE PROPHETS AND THE OPEN MIND Being expert neither in the field of science nor of religion , we are relieved of the responsibility of discussing a theme whose treatment has suffered from everything but neglect . It is pos-sible , however , to treat the well-worn problem of science versus religion in all its familiar aspects purely as history and without ever leaving the ancient world , for not only were the people of late antiquity even more modern and sophisticated than those of our own world , but they thought of themselves as being very scientific , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted on a religious belief that would square exactly with everyday experience , a thoroughly common-sense and practical religion , a scientific religion in which there was no place for any nonsense about the super-natural , that is , for anything that lay beyond their own imme-diate experience . The fashionable religion of the educated classes was a sort of social gospel ; its attitude to the universe that of nil admirari ? " do n't get worked up about anything . " The only problems worth troubling about were the social problem of getting along together and the individual problem of making money and enjoying life as much as possible ? all the rest was " Old Wives ' Tales . " Such a philosophy of life may be very well in its way , but let us not call it religion . Not long ago there flourished a Soviet poet , Shershenevich , who demanded " in the name of modern , or futurity , the liberation of words from the burden of meaning . Free the words from their sense and contents ( he cried ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . . . there is not , and should not be , any sense or contents in art . ' " 1 To attribute meaning to words is a stuffy , quaint , narrow , old-fashioned , bourgeois prejudice ; yet poor Shershenevich himself could not preach his doctrine of liberating all words from any meaning except by using words that still had meaning . Just so there are ministers who would // give us religion freed from the burden of the supernatural , liberated from any old-fashioned involvements with anything beyond our everyday experience , but this doctrine of religion , with religion left out , they can convey only by using a religious vocabulary which taken in the denatured sense in which they want it to be taken would have no meaning at all . Like Shershenevich , they appeal fo rthe abandonment of the only thing that gives their appeal any force . Nothing has been more often defined than religion , and after all the philosophy , ethics , aesthetics , and sentimentality are accounted for and claimed by their proper practitioners , the irreducible religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not of this world.2 The Barthian school , according to Mr. Rufus Jones , " insists that God must be an absolute Other . ' We belittle Him and drag Him down from His true being , they say , when we say anything about Him in terms of our poor , thin , finite selves . There is nothing in us or about us through which He can be interpreted . No piling up of our empty zeros will even start on the road to infinity . Earth had no clue to offer , history had no word to say that gives any light on the exalted theme of God . We belong in the order of nature ' and He is utterly supernatural . " Now no one will accuse Mr. Jones of being stuffy or fundamentalist ? none of your supernatural religion for him ! Yet this atttiude of the Barthians is too much even for him to take ; it might all be perfectly true , he tells us , but true or not , it can not possibly be called Christian or religion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human , " he retorts , " then the incarnation of God in Christ has no real meaning or significance , and nothing that we say about God is anything more than a flatus vocis , an empty breath of sound . Religion once more withdraws from earth and becomes an irrationality ? a mere surd ? and is therefore to be left behind . " 3 Jones sees the folly of the whole thing ? when it is carried to its logical conclusions . But has he any right to take Barth to task simply for taking his own liberal dogma farther than he himself is willing to go ? Barth has put God out of the reckoning ; in the name of the Bible and religion we // can not do that , says Jones . Yet he and the whole liberal school have long since struck the prophets and the miracles and the devil from the record and made of the resurrection a mere flatus vocis , though the Bible insists on them just as emphatic-ally as it does on the incarnation . Mr. Jones wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He chuckles and chides at those quaint reactionaries who wo n't carry open-mindedness as far as he thinks it should be carried , but rolls a scandalized eye and clucks a warning tongue at those foolish radicals who carry it farther than that . The whole question turns out to be not whether one is going to be open-minded or not ? Jones himself is not open-minded in the matter of the incarnation , and the Barthians have their minds completely made up on the unsearchability of God ? but at what point one chooses to draw the line . And even in the case of these two extreme liberals one can not help noting that where each man is strong and positive is precisely in the area in which he has made up his mind , i.e. , where he is not open-minded . Is an open mind , then , a negative thing ? an empty mind ? It is , unless it is a searching mind . An oyster has few preju-dices ? in the field of astronomy it has , we may safely say , absolutely none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-mindedness ? A first-rate and very broad-minded scientist , J. B. S. Haldane , defines prejudice as " an opinion held without examining the evidence . " ' Prejudice does not consist in having made up one 's mind ? in defending an opin-ion with fervor and determination ? as too many liberals seem to think ; it consists in forming an opinion before all the evi-dence has been considered . This means that freedom from prejudice whether in the field of science or any other field requires a tremendous lot of work ? one can not be unpreju-diced without constant and laborious study of evidence ; the open mind must be a searching mind . The person who claims allegiance to science in his thinking or who is an advocate of the open mind has let himself in for endless toil and trouble . But what has happened ? Those who have called them-selves liberals in religion have accepted science with open arms precisely because they believe that excuses them from any toil at all . For them to have an open mind means to ac118 THE WORLD AND THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence , whatever the prevailing opinions of the experts may prescribe . This is what Haldane calls prejudice . Evolution was hailed as the new gospel not because it raised new ques-tions or spurred some men to new searches , but because for the man in the street and the lazy student , as well as for the people who wrote books for them , it meant the end of all searching and the end of all doubt . Here was the answer to everything , and no open-minded nonsense about it . I re-cently reviewed a two-volume work on ancient history in which the author had obviously not bothered to read more than a fraction of his sources . Why should he bother ? By the evolutionary rule-of-thumb he could reconstruct the whole broad course of history with confidence and ease , oblivious to the disquieting fact that the documents , had he taken the trouble to read them , would have told him a very different story . Evolution was the conclusion on which he based his facts . The doctrine , however useful in other fields , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , where its ready-made answers to everything have spared stu-dents the pains and denied them the experience of finding out for themselves what the texts actually say . In the field of religion especially , the actual study of evidence constantly rebuffs the evolutionary prejudices of the scholars , who feel they can not do without this precious time-and-thought-saver . It is a " well-known law of the history of liturgy , " for example , " that the development . . . has led from pluriformity to uniformity , and not the reverse . " ' Again , scholars have searched long and in vain for an Urtext , a pure , simple original , to the Septuagint , unaware , Paul Kahle points out , that " the standard text of a translation is always found at the end of the development , never at the beginning , " where one would expect it . ' Any college student can tell you that the organization of the Christian church must have passed from primitive , loosely coordinated beginnings to an increas-ingly integrated and effective system . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence must be dealt with ; accordingly , to quote Schermann , " every letter of Paul in which such a fixed organization of the church is // implied is , in spite of its linguistic affinity to other letters which are recognized as genuine , and in spite of the close identity of its content and thought with theirs , condemned without mercy and overwhelmed with charges of interpola-tion . " ' This is not a rare but a typical example of the way the school of " scientific " scholarships operates . As another example , the unfolding pattern of history requires that the idea of the Messiah shall have first arisen in Israel after the exile . But there are some significant pre-exilic passages in the Old Testament that refer to the Messiah . What do the scholars do with these ? They simply declare them to be interpolations , and then remove the offensive things from the text : The re-sult is a reformed text which brilliantly confirms the theory on which it was reformed . They produce a new text that is carefully tailored to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the theory is correct ! ' Incredible as it may seem , this cheap and easy circular method became the standard pro-cedure and the indispensable tool of the higher critics , who operated on the principle that , while to ignore evidence is a sign of prejudice , to alter and adjust it to fit one 's precon-ceptions is a mark of brilliance and ingenuity . This may be the result of trying to apply the scientific method in an area where judgment must always remain large-ly subjective . And yet one wonders when one contemplates the behavior of the scientists themselves . Last November at a meeting of the Geological Society of London the famous Pilt-down Man was shown to be a hoax . It was not only a hoax , we are now told , but it was such an extremely clumsy hoax that it is hard to see how it ever fooled anybody . Only one thing can explain the solemn acceptance and high honors accorded this battered skull by the highest authorities for over half a century , and that is an over-powering desire , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area where evidence was badly needed . The news has now leaked out that the November meeting " broke up into a series of fist-fights , so strong was the feeling on both sides of the question . The fracas resulted in the expulsion of several members of the dignified scientific body . " Strong
