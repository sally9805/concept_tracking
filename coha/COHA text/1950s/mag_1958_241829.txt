Every day , chemists synthesize new compounds or find more efficient ways of mass-producing old ones ; every week , technologists put a few of them to use in industry or manufacture . A few of them , at least , are carcinogens ( i.e. , can cause cancer ) . The result , says Dr. Ivor Cornman in Cancer Research , is that the U.S. is " submerged in carcinogens , few of which we can recognize . " Biologist Cornman , of the Hazleton Laboratories in Falls Church , Va. , is not exercised about coal-tar derivatives used in dye-making , some oil products , chromate and uranium ore dusts : their hazards are recognized and it is up to industry ( with a prod from government ) to see that they are used safely . Neither is he alarmed by chemicals added to food : these are being tested for safety ( though in many cases belatedly ) . <P> What Biologist Cornman wants to see is a concerted research effort to study everything in man 's environment , on the chance that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause is still unknown . The project would resemble the mass screening , currently under way , of all substances now on chemists ' shelves , in the hope of finding cures for cancer . A major difficulty : the job is so huge that it would keep hundreds of laboratories working full blast . With the chemists churning out so many new products , Dr. Cornman concedes : " We will have to run fast just to keep up . "
