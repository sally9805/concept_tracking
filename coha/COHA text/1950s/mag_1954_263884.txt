Three terms of teaching at the Harvard summer school taught French Author-Lecturer Pierre Emmanuel enough about American students to give him serious misgivings . Compared to his former lycee pupils in France , he reports in the Atlantic Monthly , the average U.S. college student-in spite of his spontaneity and curiosity-has an intellectual background that is often chaotic , usually confused , and generally notable for its " absence of basic information . " <P> <P> " I believe , " says he , " that I am not going too far in saying that U.S. education at the high-school level is mediocre . The fault does not lie with the teaching staff . The tenets of democratic egalitarianism are so strong in the United States that they assume a downright metaphysical importance . The postulate goes this way : All minds must have an equal chance at the start . They are like fertile fields ; all that needs to be done is to sow them with method and prevent their differences from growing more marked , since differences contradict the principle of fundamental equality of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education must be immediately useful " partly sterilizes education , turning it from a cultural undertaking into mere social adaptation to the American kaleidoscope . Often I have been fascinated , in my conversations with American students , by the bits of knowledge emerging without reason from the recesses of the mind , floating at the surface , then vanishing as others take their place . . . <P> " An absence of basic information is particularly noticeable in the fields of literature and history . Instead of being concentrated , channeled , continually kept aware of that ' spiritual duration ' which is manifest in the evolution of thought , the attention roams distractedly and fails to grasp the unity of culture : only scattered components remain in the mind-ruins , one might almost say . At best , when the youthful mind strives to connect these disjecta membra without having in its possession the means necessary to resurrect them-the historical sequence , the sense of time , the network of causal relations-the student is led to formulate hazardous inductions , fantastic or superficial comparisons , pitiful attempts at synthesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an integrated kind of knowledge and the fragility of its foundations . . . " <P> <P> Love at First Sight . It is true , says Emmanuel , that the American often presents a kind of freshness that the European student lacks , but " too many American students neglect the compass which history gives them for the sake of a personal approach to the classics . . . How quickly the American student makes friends with a book or a man and treats them as if they were his contemporaries ! He hardly knows the background from which they arise . They surge out of his own mental world , haunt him , call forth in him an instantaneous and , frequently , a passionate reaction . A fortnight later , however , others have taken their place ; it is love at first sight , but indifference rapidly follows . "
