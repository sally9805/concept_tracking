( See Cover ) <P> The man the London conference was all about stayed home in Cairo last week , getting in provisions for a long fight . Gamal Abdel Nasser affected to be confident , but he could not bring off an appearance of indifference . TIME Correspondent John Mecklin , in a private interview , found him tense and unusually subdued , in his bare little office in the building beside the Nile that ex-King Farouk built as his yacht house . Dictator Nasser seemed more concerned about the threat of economic sanctions than of armed invasion . His right knee jiggled constantly as he talked . <P> The London conference ? " I do n't know what to expect . We had a reply today from Monsieur Pineau in his speech . He said he would agree to our ownership of the canal if we would agree to internationalize it . " Nasser leaned back laughing , and lit up an L &; M cigarette . <P> " Really , " he said , " there 's a lot of confusion about this . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of our land . " <P> What would he like the U.S. to do now ? " Be fair , just fair . The Russians are fair , you are not . In your proposals of yesterday you are supporting collective colonialism , while the Russians in their proposals today are supporting our sovereignty and dignity . " <P> Is a neutral policy still possible for Egypt ? " What 's a neutral policy ? Neutrality is a term to use only in war . We adopt an independent policy , a policy of active coexistence . One-third of our trade is with the Western bloc , one-third with the Eastern bloc , and one-third with the rest of the world . If our trade had all been with the West , we would be in a very critical position today . Thank God we had this policy . " He lit another cigarette , fingered his Dunhill lighter nervously . <P> What if Egypt should be attacked ? " We would fight . " <P> What if the West should apply economic sanctions ? " We would try by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient country . What would the effect be upon world conscience ? This would be an action against the sovereignty and independence of all countries . The West would lose ground all over the world . " <P> Would Egypt try to increase its trade with Russia ? " Of course , we would use any means when it 's a choice of starving or cooperating with anyone . In this connection we are preparing to receive a Chinese delegation at the end of this month . They are ready to supply anything we ca n't get from the outside . " Arms ? " We have enough arms . We think about food if there are going to be sanctions . " <P> " Somewhere in Jordan . " The dictator 's remarks were made with an assurance that his demeanor did not fully match . This was a heady game he was playing : one man against 22 of the world 's most powerful nations-though he counted on having some on his side to begin with , and others if he played his cards right .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
