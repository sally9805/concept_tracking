txt The Senate today brought the Administration 's severely rewritten civil rights bill to the point of final approval . ' - . At quitting time this afternoon all that was left to be done to the bill was its formal passage next week  --  overwhelmingly by every sign . This may come about Wednesday , after all-out opponents from the Southern right wing and the advanced civil rights group from the left wing have made final records of their contrasting dissatisfactions . All . work of consequence on the bill was ? finished in a sevenhour session today . The real focus of the struggle passed tonight to efforts to control the situation when the Senate's. fundamentally altered version fs put up for reconciliation against the /intact Administia tion program passed by the House of Representatives . House Agreement Sought 1 Senator Lyndon B. Johnson , of Texas , chief of the Senate coalition that won a sweeping victory oven the Administration forces , already was moving on this matter . The Johnson forces , made up of Western ' liberal Democrats , Southern Democrats and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House concurrence in the Senate text . Such an . outcome would send the bill to the White House and put on the President the responsibility to sign or veto it . The - assumption among them was general that the Administration was determined to kill the , bill rather than see the Senate 's provision for the right of jury trial in criminal contempt cases be accepted by the House . In Touch With Rayburn ' There was a Democratic belief that the Republicans would now prefer to hold the issue over until 1958 , ' a . Congressional election year . This would force a wide rupture in the comparative North-South unity that Senator Johnson had managed to maintain-throughout the struggle . Mr. Johnson , the Senate Democratic leader , accordingly was in close , touch with the Speaker of the House , Sam Rayburn of Texas , also a Democrat . There are two ways in which livergent Senate and House bills nay be brought together . One is trough the formal appointment of conferees from each chamber to negotiate , to bargain and to report proposed compromises back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit the House conferees insist to the end on restoringto the measure its provisions for no jury trials and for proposed Federal injunctive sanctions to force school integration in the South . An adamant House position of this kind almost certainly would result in no bill . The Southern Senators , who were brought along by Senator Johnson to support the milder Senate approach , would open an all-out filibuster  --  a deliberately time - killing maneuver to prevent any decisive vote  --  against the House text . The Senate early this morning by a 51 to 42 vote , wrote into Part IV of the ' Administration bill a jury trial guarantee over the repeatedly expressed objections of the President . Earlier it struck out by a vote of 52 to 38 an Administration proviso in Part III that would have dealt With school . integration . The Johnson coalition , therefore , put all its hopes and plans on avoiding a Senate-House conference . The Second Means The second available means for- effecting reconciliation between differing Senate and House texts is to have one chain , : ber  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' verskin . Either approach requires mastery of the House Rules Committee , which controls the flow of legislative traffic ' in that chamber . The committee can recommend a conference or it can simply recommend concurrence . All this was in the background in the sense of chronology , but vitally in the foreground in the sense of reality , as the Senate put its finishing touches on the bill . A single substantial amendment was adopted , and this , though meeting the wishes of the Johnson group , was offered by the leader of the Administration coalition , Senator William F. Knowland of California . It struck from Part I of the Administration 's text  --  a section setting up a Federal civil rights commission with subpoena ' powers  --  authority for the commission to use " volunteer " help in its investigations of racial discrimination . This was a thrust at such organizations as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . It was stipulated also that the President 's appointee as staff director of the commission be subject to confirmation by a majority vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced or vehement civil rights advocate who might be chosen by the President for the post would have a difficult time in obtaining Senate approval . A series of proposed amendments from the all-out civil rights forces were quickly rejected , one by one . These would have : 9Forbade the military draft of persons denied the right to vote . gLimited the bill 's jury trial guarantee to voting rights cases . fiSet in motion legal machinery to deprive - Southern States  --  of some of their representation in the House of Representatives to the degree- that they withheld the voting right . Thus the bill on which the Senate is now prepared to vote finally next week would have these main provisions : qIt would establish a civil rights commission , but Without the ? " volunteer " authority sought by the Administration and with a staff director subject to , Seri-. ate- confirmation . 41A special civil rights division would be set up within the Department of Justice. 4IThe measure affirms the right:of an individual to go into Federal Court on his own for injunctions to protect his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal prosecutors to intervene-With ' an injunction to protect  --  the whole range of civil rights , including the right toattend an integrated school . ? ** measure would also permit Federal prosecutors , with or without the consent of the victims . to obtain injunctions against actual or threatened denial of the right to vote , . Persons refusing to obey these injunctions could be fined or imprisoned by a federal judge sitting without jury for . civil contempt .. In criminal contempt cases the judge would be required to give a jury trial. - Under the Senate 's alteration , which some of the advanced civil-rights forces have privately said *mild reach " 95 ' per cent of the voting rights cases , " the judge would decide what was civil ' arid . What was criminal contempt . " Leaders in the House : of ! Representatives had tentatively planned ' a recess beginning next 1 . Veek-end , on the prospect that the Senate would go into an extended . session . With odds now in favor of early Senate passage of the bill , the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
