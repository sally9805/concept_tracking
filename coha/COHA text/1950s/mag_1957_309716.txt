No one heard the beeps of the Soviet Sputnik more clearly last week than U.S. toymakers , who lost no time blasting off on an 18,000-m.p.h. orbit all their own . Looking ahead to Christmas , the toymen were already well-stocked with an arsenal of celestial hardware . They quickly launched a crash program to unwrap the stuff . " The second I heard about the Russian satellite , " said one somber-voiced toyman , " I knew we had to move fast . " <P> Big mail-order houses and retailers everywhere happily hurled themselves into space . Advertising a $5.89 telescope in its new winter catalogue .

Rushed to the store by cargo planes and taxicabs , some 10,000 satellite balloons , ray guns and missile trackers were crammed into a new display area manned by perspiring salesmen in space suits and helmets .

Another gadget : a $7.98 " Sky Sweeper Truck . " which beams searchlight silhouettes of jet planes against a wall , shoots them down with two " Nike " rockets . In seven days Ideal shipped out 100,000 Satellite Launchers , another 50,000 Sky Sweeper trucks . " This may be a propaganda blow to the U.S. , " cried an Ideal executive .
