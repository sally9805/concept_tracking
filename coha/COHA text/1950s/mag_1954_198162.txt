Behind a gold-painted locomotive , a trainload of G.M. brass rolled into Flint , Mich , last week to celebrate the production of G.M. 's 50 millionth car . While G.M. President Harlow Curtice looked on , a gold-plated Chevrolet rolled off the assembly line . At lavish luncheons in 52 hotels scattered through the U.S. , and in Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall , another 15,000 invited guests watched the festivities over the most extensive closed-circuit TV network ever rigged . <P> For G.M. it was a great occasion . " Red " Curtice predicted a 10% rise in the auto industry 's output next year ( to 5,800,000 cars ) . By 1970 , he said , G.M. would produce its 100 millionth car . The party was just as big an occasion for another company : Manhattan 's Theatre Network Television , Inc . ( T.N.T. ) , which assembled the private TV circuit . It was T.N.T . ' s 75th big-screen production . <P> Football &; Four Roses . T.N.T . was started just five years ago by Nathan Halpern , a University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Stanton before deciding to go into closed-circuit TV . He thought that movie theaters would be glad to get back some of the customers they had lost to TV . <P> Halpern has run such star-spangled events as the Marciano-Charles heavyweight championship fight last September and the opening of the Metropolitan Opera in November ( TIME , Nov. 22 ) . But he also learned that the big money lay in televising national sales meetings and other conventions for big corporations . In the past two years T.N.T . has televised eleven conventions for companies ranging from National Dairy ( Seal-test ) to James Lees carpets . At one such TV roundup , International Business Machines was able to brief 2,000 salesmen in Manhattan on a new electronic brain instead of bringing them to its Poughkeepsie , N.Y . plant in groups . Frankfort Distillers ( Four Roses , Paul Jones ) gave its salesmen in 19 cities fresh tips for selling whisky , along with a variety show put together by T.N.T. , featuring Guy Lombardo 's band and Aptor Robert Cummings . <P> Travel &; Trouble . T.N.T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production to $150,000 for national presentation of " package " shows that include cameras , circuit lines , scripts and actors . Customers have found the rates are often far below the cost of picking up travel expenses for an entire company 's sales force . Last week 's show , for example , cost G.M. several hundred thousand dollars ( including rental of 50 giant , mobile projectors that Halpern bought for $500,000 ) . But it was much cheaper-and far less trouble-than trying to bring all the guests to Flint . <P> When Halpern launched T.N.T. , only seven theaters were set up for closed-circuit TV ; now there are more than 100 . With them , plus a network of hotels and their built-in banquet facilities , Halpern thinks T.N.T . has just started to explode .
