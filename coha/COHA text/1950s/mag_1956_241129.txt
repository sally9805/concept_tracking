As the seventh year of Indonesian independence drew to a close , the world 's fourth largest democracy ( pop . 80 million ) was behaving something like a banana republic . " I am certain , " said Indonesia 's handsome President Soekarno , in a sharp departure from his customary exuberance , " that if this sickly situation persists , conditions will become ripe for a revolution . " <P> The Cabinet of goateed Premier Ali Sastroamidjojo was all but impotent , its members amounting to little more than messenger boys for the bosses of eight bickering political parties . Grafting had become so much of a public scandal that last week Indonesia 's Attorney General brought charges against Foreign Minister Roeslan Abdulgani , whom the press accused of having accepted $130,000 in bribes . <P> Incensed by governmental corruption and by the irregularity and inadequacy of its pay , the republic 's husky ( 168,000 men ) , well-equipped army was openly restive . In mid-November , when 500 troops started a march on Djakarta , the capital was paralyzed with fear , and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several commanders relieved of their posts , the rebellious leader , former Army Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel Zulkifli Lubis , was still at large last week . <P> Thought from Russia . President Soekarno , who for eleven years has exercised an almost mystical sway over Indonesia 's masses , was confident he knew the cure for what ailed his nation . " I do n't want to become a dictator , " said he . " I am a democrat , but it is not democratic liberalism that I want . What I want is guided democracy . All political parties must be buried . " <P> Vague as it was , Soekarno 's proposal sounded suspiciously like something he might have picked up during his recent visits to Russia and China , where he was bothered by the lack of freedom but impressed by the way that vast work projects were organized . Such notions did not suit Soekarno 's old friend and Indonesia 's longtime Vice President Mohammed Hatta , whose remedy is to replace Indonesia 's multiparty parliamentary government with something more like the U.S. system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal to listen to his ideas , respected Mohammed Hatta resigned the vice-presidency . <P> Last week , in his first interview since his resignation , Hatta told TIME Correspondent Paul Hurmuses : " There is great unrest and uneasiness throughout Indonesia today . We are democratic in Indonesia today all right-ultra-democratic . . . We have got to have a strong government . " ( One suggestion for a stronger government came from the fugitive Colonel Lubis , who offered to surrender if Soekarno would make Hatta Premier and fire the army 's chief of staff . ) <P> Buffalo Revolt . Reeling under the combined disapproval of Soekarno , Hatta and much of the army , leaders of eight non-Communist parties last week closeted themselves in the home of Djakarta 's mayor to come up with a " housecleaning program . " To most politically savvy Indonesians , however , it appeared doubtful that the parties were in a position to make reforms sufficiently drastic to restore their shattered reputations . " A Cabinet crisis now , " said one political boss , " would mean the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
