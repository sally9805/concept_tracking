In his Washington office Harry Jacob Anslinger keeps a sinister collection of heroin , opium pipes , and other paraphernalia seized by the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics , which he organized in 1930 and has headed ever since . Last week Commissioner Anslinger , 62 , a Pennsylvania Dutchman who knows more about the worldwide drug traffic than any other man on earth . reported to the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee a growing narcotic menace : Communist China 's $60 million-a-year dope trade , deliberately and officially pursued to earn foreign exchange , " finance political activities , and spread addiction among free peoples . " <P> Anslinger said that in five years Red China 's opium production has tripled from 2,000 tons annually to 6,000-ten times world medicinal needs ( for morphine , codeine , paregoric , etc . ) . <P> Unlike the Chinese Nationalists , who executed as many as 1,000 dope dealers annually in their highly successful efforts to reduce dope addiction , the Communists , while forbidding drugs to party members , organized the National Trading Co. to distribute narcotics under Foreign Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied by the bureau network of undercover agents abroad . He named Red China 's new dope factories and brands ( Camel , Race Horse , Red Lion , etc . ) . He outlined the smuggling system , from camelback to air transport . <P> Despite the new flow of drugs from Red China , U.S. narcotic addiction has declined , and the rate is now down to one person in 3,000 ( some 60,000 addicts ) compared to one in 400 ( 300,000 addicts ) in 1930 . In Asia , however , Communist China 's lucrative narcotic trade has vastly increased drug addiction . Japan , which had no recorded drug addicts until recent years , now has 25,000 or 30,000 entirely supplied by dope from Red China .
