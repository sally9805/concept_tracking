txt Foreign policy seldom raises its homburged head when Mos. - sachusetts voters discuss their reasons for voting in November .. Only two groups seem vitally concerned with how Washington wields its influence overseas . These are the Jewish and Greek-American communities . Reports from leaders of these communities , confirmed by house-to-house checks , indicate that there will be a sizable switch from President Eisenhower to Adlai E. Stevenson in those groups next month . The reason , rightly or wrongly , is John Foster Dulles . As Secretary of State , Mr. Dulles is embroiled in a continuing Middle Eastern crisis that at times has appeared to these groups to align the administration on the side of the Arabs against Israel and on the side of Britain against Greece and the rebellious Greek Cypriotes . Dulles Major Target The strong criticism usually is reserved for Mr. Dulles , but President Eisenhower and the whole Republican ticket are likely to be affected . The Greek-American community in New England may be expected to cast perhaps 58,000 ballots in November , of which some 39,000 will come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of the voters who classify themselves as independents , but who leaped on the Eisenhower bandwagon in 1952 , will shift their votes to Mr. Stevenson this year because of the Cyprus issue . They add that some Democratic voters who switched to Mr. Eisenhower in 1952 will follow suit and return to Mr. Stevenson . More important is the effect of the Israeli issue on the Jewish community , which numbers about 135,000 eligible voters in Massachusetts , with heavy concentrations in several Boston wards , in Brookline , Newton , Brighton , Belmont , Worcester , Fall River , New Bedford , Springfield , Lowell , and Lynn . Beginning with the Roosevelt era , most of these Jewish communities became heavily Democratic . But in 1952 there were sizable defections to Mr. Eisen ' hower , particularly in middle income areas like Worcester and upper income areas like Newton  --  but even reaching into such Democratic bloc-voting areas , as Ward 14 , Boston , which had averaged votes of almost 90 per cent for Roosevelt . Ward 8 in suburban , traditionally Republican , Brookline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1944 the ward gave Roosevelt a 79 per cent majority ; in 1952 Mr. Stevenson garnered only a 52 per cent majority . This year , samplings indicate , perhaps half the 1952 Democratic defectors will switch back to Mr. Stevenson . This expected shift is due almost solely to the Israeli question . As one upper income family housewife said , " Certainly we have peace and prosperity here . My husband has never done better , and he 's going to vote for ' Ike ' But I 've put in too much time , effort , ? and money into helping build a recreation center in Israel to let that marl Mr. Dulles wipe it all out . " The findings of Prof. Lawrence H. Fuchs , assistant professor of political science at Brandeis University , who recently published a book on the history of Jewish voting , confirm this example , Professor Fuchs told an interviewer that this year he has observed an almost unbelievable solidarity among Jewish wives of all income groups . - Even when a successful businessman votes for Mr. Eisenhower his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in marked Contrast to the usual situation which has found housewives generally more favorable to President Eisenhower than their husbands . Confidence in President However , ' Professor Fuchs also remarked that even among upper income businessmen there were signs of the prevalent shifting to Mr , Stevenson . He said that in a group of 103 Jewish business and professional men in Lynn he-had discovered 26 who said they were switching from Mr. Eisenhower to Mr. Stevenson this year , and only 2 who were doing the reverse . Wards 12 and 14 in Boston , forming one of the heaviest concentrations of Jewish voters in the ' United States , are militantly set against the administration on the question of policy toward Israel . Around the tables of the G &G; Delicatessen in Dorchester ( Ward 14 ) , for instance , the patrons discuss Mr. Dulles ' alleged blunders almost as often as they bite into their lox on dark rye sandwiches . The few dissenters , often as not parents of the more vehe ment antiadministration arguers , feel that Mr. Eisenhower still is as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things get really difficult in the Middle East , they say , the President will step in over . Mr. Dulles ' head and prevent a shooting war . Nevertheless , their ward apparently is returning emphatically to the Democratic side . Comparisons of the Republican and Democratic planks on Israel have been circulated quite widely in all Jewish communities . These favor the Democrats , who pledge a renewal of arms aid to Israel , over the Republicans , who promise only to defend the young Middle Eastern state if it is attacked . Close Race Indicated The prospective .. shift in Brookline and . Boston 's Ward 12 portends a close race in the 10th Congressional District . In 1954 Democrat Jackson J. Holtz was defeated , by incumbent Representative Laurence Curtis by only 1,894 out of 143,000 votes cast . This year Mr. Holtz is rated an even chance to win that post . If he does so , Massachusetts Democratic representatives in . Congress will outnumber their Republican colleagues 8 to 6 in Washington . Although other minority groups in the Bay State are more populous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voter turnouts add ; emphasis to relatively slight shifts of allegiance . And split ticket balloting is also more prevalent in Jewish communities than in most voter groups . This factor may give some aid to Republican gubernatorial candidate . Sumner Whittier in his tight race with Democrat Foster Furcolo . Many voters polled said they were going to vote for Mr. Stevenson but were considering X-Ing Mr. Whittier and Attorney General George Fingold on their ballots as well . Mr. Whittier has spoken Irequently In favor of ' more United States support for Israel . This has brought him remarkable support in the otherwise Democratic Jewish wards , as was evidenced in 1952 . In that election the then Lieutenant Governor received 1,000 more votes in Ward 12 than did Pr ? sident Eisenhower . The GOP still has a firm foothold in the middle and upper income Jewish communities . Its strength ' often lies with community leaders and successful businessmen . But current evidence is that this ? is a year of retrenchment for them .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
