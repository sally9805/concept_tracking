txt When it comes to delivering the pep talks for the defense effort , leading the cheers or taking the bows , the assignments seem to be distributed more or less by rotation among Washington 's top-drawer officials . But when the job is one that calls for a simple , straightforward discussion of the specific responsibilities of a given group ( particularly if the statement must be presented to the representatives of the group themselves ) there never is any doubt from the moment the team goes into its huddle who is going to be found carrying the ball . It is going to be " Mike " DiSalle . Mr. DiSalle has n't hesitated to state his views on agriculture 's obligations before Congressional committees heavily laden with farm bloc members ; and he has been just as forthright in his face-to-face talks with leaders of business and industry . Now he has performed a similar public service by appearing before the convention of the C. I. 0 . and delivering what probably was the only completely non-political talk made before that assemblage . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups temper their pay demands in this defense period to avoid wage gains at the expense of other workers . " It is obviously impossible , " said the Director of Price Stabilization , " to base wage policy under controls upon the strength or weakness of unions . Neither can wage policy be based upon the employer 's ability to pay . " And he added : If excessive , wage increases are granted only in industries where employers can absorb them without price increases , and denied when price increases would be required , all equity disappears from the wage policy . A6tually , if excessive wage increases are granted in industries where employers can absorb them it is impossible to prevent similar wage increases in other industries where employers may be unable to absorb . Thus an excessive wage increase , granted in an industry which does not require price relief , either creates injustices * * * or leads directly to inflationary price increases in other areas . If there was anything unrealistic about Mr. DiSalle 's wage policy statement it would appear to have been his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unhappily , it seems much more nearly certain that the views of the C. I. 0 . ' s resolutions committee , which rejects that policy , will be adopted . This committee promptly announced as its wage philosophy that the greatest contribution the unions could make to the national welfare was to " fight for higher living standards , " which , rephrased in the language of Mr. DiSalle , means , of course , insisting upon " a bigger slice of the nation 's pie . " At the same time It called upon the Wage Stabilization Board to stop interfering with wage advances " won through collective bargaining . " It is worth bearing in mind that the W. S. B. against which the committee is now inveighing is the reconstituted version of that agency , created for the express purpose of mollifying labor , which had walked out on its predecessors . It is also worth noting that , far from being inflexible , the wage formula has been undergoing a steady process of liberalization since the first board 's " 10 per cent " rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more than kept abreast of the increase in living costs . What the C. I. 0 . committee seems to be demanding now is that it be permitted to choose either to accept the formula of the W. S. B. or to retain what it can get by collective bargaining , whichever is the more advantageous .
