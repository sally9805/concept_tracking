The Excess Profits Tax <P> Not since Prohibition has there been a U.S. law so widely condemned as the excess profits tax , which will die on June 30 unless Congress , heeding the President 's appeal last week ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , extends it . Nobody hates the tax more than Treasury Secretary George Humphrey . " Its worst enemy can very well voice our feelings about it , " says he . " It 's a bad tax . " But he and President Eisenhower feel that the U.S. needs the $800 million that an extra six months of excess profits taxes would yield . Thus , Congress itself must decide whether expediency shall outweigh an admitted evil . <P> The evil arose in logical enough fashion . In World War I , the first excess profits tax was slapped on to prevent war profiteering . Its yield of $2.5 billion was big for those days , when a whole year 's war budget was only $6 billion . In World War II , EPT 's yield was tremendous : $28 billion , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tax again made a rough sort of sense because the bulk of industry was mobilized and fared equally under EPT . But when EPT was slapped on again in 1950 , even the tax 's Fair Deal advocates admitted that it was unsound-although its very name made it politically popular . In a semi-mobilized economy , such a tax could not skim the profits from arms contracts without also spooning out the legitimate profits of consumer industries . <P> Actually , " excess profits tax " is a misnomer . The law does not merely take the " excess " profits , but starts its levy as soon as profits reach 85% of " normal , " i.e. , what they were during the " base period " of 1946-49 . Furthermore , the tax has a built-in discrimination in the choice of payments . A company may elect to pay a tax based on its 1946-49 earnings , or one based on a fixed return ( 8% ) on its total capitalization . Thus , debt-ridden companies with huge capitalizations , like many railroads , escape the tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose a profits base-and then be penalized when greater efficiency increases their profits . To make allowance for such inequities , Congress included so many exemptions and exceptions that no two accountants can agree on a company 's EPT bill . As a result , virtually every payment has been protested . Another discriminatory result is that EPT affects only 15% of all corporations paying taxes and consequently yields comparatively little revenue ( only $2 billion a year out of a total of $21 billion in corporate taxes paid last year ) .
