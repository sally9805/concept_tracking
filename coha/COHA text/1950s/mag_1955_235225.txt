By joining the Western alliance , West Germany got the right , and the duty , to form an army . Chancellor Adenauer was anxious to get started before the new , balmy atmosphere from the East thawed his nation 's resolve . Knowing that he must beware of many , inside and out of Germany , who still fear German militarism , he moved surely as ever , but more quickly than usual . On Monday morning last week he visited President Heuss. tendered his own resignation as Foreign Minister ( a job he has combined with the Chancellorship for four years ) , and nominated two key new ministers : To be Foreign Minister : his friend , Heinrich von Brentano ( see box ) . To be Minister for Defense : small ( 5 ft. 4 in . ) Trade Unionist Theodor Blank , 49 , since 1950 head of a shadow defense ministry called " Bureau Blank , " which is set up in a dingy brick building in a Bonn back street . In 1933 , Union Organizer Blank chose unemployment rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wehrmacht as a private , finished up as a first lieutenant in an American P.W . camp . Blank makes frequent speeches about how the new army will be de-Prussianized ; the real soldiers who will command the troops are currently being kept out of the headlines . <P> At the same time , Adenauer put pressure on the Bundesrat ( the Upper House ) to push through an emergency bill for recruiting army volunteers , without waiting for the complicated enabling legislation setting up terms of the new army . <P> But there are others , too , who fear a Blank check . They protested that Adenauer 's three-paragraph emergency bill set precedents without creating safeguards . By a unanimous vote , the Bundesrat ( where Adenauer usually has his way ) sent his bill back with a demand for clarification of policy .
