I ? ' VE always respected the adage that a lawyer who acts as his own attorney has a fool for counsel  --  not even a lawyer can stay cool and objective in his own defense . On the cold morning of February 12 , 1951 , just before breakfast , armed Chinese communist police broke into my Shanghai home , seized , threatened and handcuffed me. rifled my room , yelled at my wife , and then pushed me into a car and rushed me off to the Ward Road Jail . As an attorney with thirty-three years of practice in China , I might have made lawyer sounds in fluent Chinese , demanding authority for this arrest and search , requesting an opportunity to contact counsel . As it happened , however , I was so terrified that all I asked was a chance to put on my clothes . " Bo Liang , you are a spy ! " the Red police shouted for the tenth time as they shoved me into a cell . " You are a running dog of Chiang Kai-shek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necktie , glasses , watch , shoestrings , belt and even the rope that tied my bedding  --  to make sure I did n't commit suicide . I stood there foolishly , my hands in my pockets to hold up my trousers , and watched as they slammed shut the steel door and went away . When the police left , I sat down on my blankets , shaking as in a fever . I do n't know how long I sat there , dazed and trying to get my bearings . Why was I here ? What crime had I committed ' ? Here I was , an American citizen fifty-eight years old , born of miaaionary parents in Shanghai . I 'd grown up knowing and liking the Chinese people . I 'd practiced law in Shanghai 's International Settlement and recently defended Western businessmen in their last stand in China , while the enterprises of a century collapsed in a year of the People 's Government . In all this I could find no crime . In the past , I remembered , in the days when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate to the International Settlement . Entrusted with preserving law and order , I had handled some 280,000 cases of major crime . Among them were approximately 14,000 cases in which communists were involved . My impartial role of Municipal advocate was no crime in any conceivable court of law , Rut in the mad communist wonderland , I knew that my past record must now be a major crime , demanding the death penalty . As municipal advocate , I had sent more than 250,000 prisoners to the Word Road Jail and I had examined every corner of this mammoth prison during my official monthly inspection 1 rips . Now I was in the " new building " ? a bleak pile of reinforced concrete . In this building I occupied a very special cell . It was octagonal and entirely lined  --  walls , ceiling and floor  --  with cork . The Chinese had called it the " rubber room , " explaining that a Prisoner in this cell who tried to bash his head against the wall would bounce back uninjured . This was the death cell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat for quite a while , thinking of the irony of the prosecutor imprisoned in his own jail , and waves of gloom swept over me . After a bit , I began to explore my surroundings . It was extremely cold and I kept my overcoat on as I walked . The cell was about nine feet across , and bare , except for a red bucket to be used as a toilet . On the cork floor my feet moved soundlessly like cola ' paws . Overhead , a light came dimly through a gritting.in the ceiling , but there were no windows . There was some scribbling on the cork walls near the steel door , Most of the ecraw Is were in Chinese ? lewd sayings and much cursing of I he chief warden , who had directed the prison in the last days of the Municipal Council . As I looked away from the wall , something caught my attention at the door . There , in the small glass window , was an eye , a pouring black eye like an animal 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stared for some time before it went away . A little later  --  it must have been about noontime  --  the door opened and someone pushed in a small aluminum trough of food  --  red rice , pickled cabbage and a container of hot water . As I began to eat , the eye returned and stared some more , and I lost my appetite . All that day the guard 's eye kept staring at me as if I were some monstrosity . At night a ceiling light was turned on , and when I lay down in my blankets , I could still see the eye through the peephole . Every fifteen minutes or so , the guard was back , staring , pounding on the door and shouting for me to move my head . He wanted to he sure I was still alive until they were ready for me . I did n't sleep much that night , nor the next day eit her , since my guard kept pounding and shouting at the door . Finally , on the second night , 1 lost my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Chinese phrases coming quickly to mind . " I 'm not going to kill myself , you dog ! Why ca n't you let me alone , you turtle , you egg , you worm ? Get away , get away , get away ! " My curses apparently did some good , for now the guard went away and did n't come back on his rounds for two hours . I got a little sleep that night and the next , until I heard two of the guards talking outside my door . Their conversation chilled me . " Who 's that funny-looking foreigner with the bad eye and the red nose ? " one of them naked . " Oh , that 's an important one , " said the other . " That 's Bo Liang , who used to be municipal advocate . His hands are stained with the blood of our communist comrades . The People 's Government will give him justice . " " Ali , so that is the wang pa tan ! " said the first guard , using a shocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has forgotten the eight virtues and sinned against his ancestors . " He will be emasculated , he will be given the thousand cuts , his body will be thrown to the dogs . " At this moment , I knew more Chinese lore than I wished to know . If my guards were well-informed , the communists were now reverting to ancient Chinese torture , which had been outlawed during the Nationalist regime . In Shanghai , while I was municipal advocate , I had fought ceaselessly against any practice of torture . I had promptly prosecuted several police officers for such modest torture by Oriental atandardel as electric shock , burning with lighted cigarettes , hanging by the feet and pouring water down the nose . But the communists , 1 reflected , bad publicly boasted of their high skill in torture . Perhaps , as my guards suggested , they actually used the punishment of a thousand cuts . This ancient technique dated back to the Chow dynasty , when rebels were cut 999 times in nonvital parts of the body . The thousandth cut was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving me in panic . I would doze off and wake up suddenly , terrified by nightmares . Then I began to pray . Prayer has come naturally to me since childhood , when my missionary father knit gave me his sense of God and Christianity . Now 1 recited the 23rd Psalm , and I prayed that my communist captors would release me. that I would find a way to plead my case . The next afternoon , February fifteenth , two guards in yellow uniforms took me out of my cell . I was filthy , I had a heavy beard , my hair was matted , and I bad not removed my clothes in three days . They shouted at me , " Come along , you Amer-35 lean imperialistic pig , you running dog ! " They seized my collar and pushed me along ahead of them , declaring over and over again that I was a tsou hou , or " running dog , " and a lulu tse , or " dog 's hips . " I knew both phrases as purl . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who follows obediently after the person whose dog he is , a fellow traveler ; a " dogs hips " was simply an enthusiastic running dog , who exercises his hips while running errands for his master . At the end of a corridor , the guards swung open the door to a large room , about 150 feet long by 60 feet wide , which in Nationalist days was the prison 's assembly hall . In the back of I he room was a platform about three feet high on which was mounted a long desk like a judge 's bench . Behind the bench sat three Chinese  --  the tall chairman in the center with his black hair brushed back in a pompadour ; a thin , emaciated man on his right ; a round , moon-faced man on his left . On the far right was the court reporter . a young Chinese with a crew cut . On the wall behind these men were crossed flags of Communist China and Soviet Russia . Below the flags were portraits of Sun Yat-sen , Mao Tse-tung and Josef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the room to a small bench under the nose of the chairman . The guards handcuffed my hands behind me. ordered me to sit up straight . Then the questioning began . I was now my own attorney and determined to use every legal device I knew , to spar for time while getting the measure of this fantastic court . " What is your name ? " the chairman said in Mandarin , " My name is Robert T. Bryan , Jr. , " I replied in English . " I would like an interpretet-assigned to me before we proceed . " The chairman had a bad cold . I noted , and rather filthy mannere . He hawked and blew his nose into space , coolie fashion . " Bo Liang , " he said , using my Chinese name , " you speak Chinese very well . You speak Chinese even better than I do . So why do you ask for an interpreter ? You only want to deceive us . You must speak to us in Chinese . This is China . We are Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knew it was senseless to argue the point and I spoke in Chinese thereafter . I asked the chairman if this was a court of law . " Shut up , " he said . If it was n't a court of law , I asked , was it a panel of procurators investigating my conduct ? " Shut up , " he said again . I pointed out that I was entitled to know before whom I was appearing and with what was charged . I asked the chairman his name . " Shut up , " he said . " You I IL : S ATLI Il I ILI ' EV EN I NG POST I CAME BACK FROM A RED DEATH CELL ttttt I f , " .. Plum 85 ) have no right to question us . We are questioning you , 130 Liang . " Still I went on making lawyer talk . I asked to have the proceedings adjourned until I could employ counsel . I asked for release upon hail so that . I might have time to prepare my defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eleven communists in New York , noting that they 'd been allowed hail pending t heir appeal to the Supreme Court . Again I was told to but up and not he ridiculous . Feeling the chairman 's mounting rage , I subsided and listened to his questions . The questions were short , abrupt and broken off by outbursts of moronic abuse . " What is your name ' ? " he asked again . " My name is Bo Liang . " " How old are you ? " " I am fifty-eight years old . " " Where do you live ' ? " " I live at Number 87 Columbia Circle . " " What do you do ? " " I am a lawyer . " At this admission , the chairman was electrified . " Alm , - he roared , " a lawyer ! You are an imperialist lawyer ! You are a parasite , a worm , a useless person ! You are an enemy of the People 's Government ! We have no use for lawyers . " He finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Are you married , Bo Liang ? " " Yes . " " How many children have you ? " " Three . " " Where do they live ? " " They are all in America . " " What do they do ? " " My son is in the Department of Commerce in Washington . My daughters are married . " " What do their husbands do ? " " One is an accountant with Sylvania Electric Products in New York . The other is a Navy officer . " Again the chairman exploded . " A Navy officer ! " he bawled . " What do you do for the Navy ' ? " I tried to explain that my son-in-law was in the Navy , not I , and that . I 'd never been in the service of the United States Navy . " Shut up ! " the chairman shouted . " You are an intelligence officer in the United States Navy ! You are a spy ! We will take care of you ! " For a time , the chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - When did you learn Chinese , Bo Liang ? " " I learned it as a child . " " Where did you learn it ' ? " " I learned it at the Ming Jang Academy . " " Why did you learn it ? " " My father insisted that I learn Chinese . I was n't especially interested , but he insisted . " " Why did your father insist ? " " Because lie knew I would live in China and he thought I should know Chinese . " " Nonsense ! " the chairman bellowed , hitting his stride again . " You learned Chinese to spy on us ! You wanted to know about us so you could report back to the Navy ! " He spoke furiously about foreigners who learn Chinese , reminding me of China 's ancient suspicion . Not only communists but all Chinese fear the foreigner who speaks their language . In their minds , he threatens the old , traditional isolation of the country , Tito incredible questioning went on for two days , covering the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by much fist-shaking , desk-pounding and endless chanting that I was a running dog and a dog 's hips of the imperialists , Truman and Chiang Kai-shek . Reaching is peak of rage , the chairmen declared that I had opposed the Communist Party as Illunicipaladvocate and sent thousands of communist patriots to prison and death . I replied that I had only done my duty as municipal advocate , that the communists on trial had committed mojorcrirries ? kidnaping , murder , rape , embezzlement  --  and that I had prosecuted none because of his political affiliation . I cited international law , observing that actions which were legal under an old government could not be made illegal by a new government . I called on the old Chinese epirit of justice and I pleaded the cause of human rights in man 's long search for human dignity . The chairman scarcely listened . Re shouted that the People 's Government did not recognize international law ; that I was subject to the laws of the People 's Government ; that I had assisted Chiang Kai-shek against the communists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a play , with every actor well-rehearsed except me . At a signal , the moon-faced man produced a fat pile of documents . I recognized them as papers taken from my office files by the communists several months before . One item was the English translation of a piimphlet called Communist Policy . It explained that the Chinese communists , like their Russian colleagues , are out to overthrow every noncommunist government in the world . The pamphlet is now on sale in almost every Shanghai Ivookstand . The chairman shook the translation at me . " What are you doing with this ' ? " he cried . " I have a perfect right to that pamphlet , " I said . " It 's sold to the public . Why should n't I have it ? " " No , " the chairman roared hoarsely , " you should n't have it . It 's a communist . book . You should n't lie reading our hooks . You 're only reading our hooks so you can tell your own people what we are and what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slapped me in the face . He then picked up a hook called The Four Big Families , a vitriolic communist attack on China 's former rulers  --  the Chiangs , the Soongs , the Kungs and the Chaos . Again I argued that I was entitled to read this book . The chairman got very angry , leaned over the bench and hit me on the head with the book . " You running dog of Truman , Acheson and Chiang Kai-shek ! " he shouted . " You 're a spy ! You have no right to such books ! - Finally the chairman got to his feet . " You are the reactionary son of an imperialist father ! " he bawled . " Your father forced the Chinese people to accept Christianity and other evil theories of imperialism which are dangerous to the Chinese people ! Bo Liang , " he went on shouting , " you arc a menace to People 's China and you must confess ! Do you hear ? You must confess ! If you do n't confess , you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you will be given the punishment of a thousand cuts , then your body will be thrown to the dogs ! " And then the chairman ordered me out , roaring that I mind confess . I trembled all the way back to my cell , cringing as the guards shoved me along . That night , for the filet iine in my life , I felt that I was bordering I in insanity . All night long the guards came to my cell , pounding on my door and bawling at me to move my head . I tried to sleep , but would suddenly wake up shaking , with my night res not nearly so terrifying as my waking thoughts . For nine days I sat alone , wait big for something to happen . I was revolted by the endless rice and cabbage . and half starved for sustaining food . Always a heavy coffee . drinker , I now missed my coffee , and headaches tortured me . I began to pray , then , that the chairman would see me again . I had plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could improve my chances by being less argumentative . Perhaps I should modify my attitude toward this court . Whenever a guard peered at me , I pleaded for another audience . On February twenty-sixth , the chairman called me to his office . He declared again that I was a spy  --  the facts were already clear and I was entitled to no further hearing . But if I would make a full apology , he might hear me again , he said . I must apologize for my arrogance , my imperialistic attitude , my persecution of the Chinese communists . I felt , listening to him , that t his was all a fantastic game of cat and mouse . First the cat wished the mouse to apologize for being only a mouse . And when the mouse apologized the cat would eat him . In the meantime I had been moved to another cell  --  one with a small table  --  and I thanked God that now , at least , I was out of the death cell . I asked my new guards for writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no difficulty in wording the apology , but I could scarcely see because my glasses were gone . My head throbbed and ached , and I had to stand back from the paper to write . My apology , as I remember , went like this : To Whom It May Concern . I hove the honor to comply with your request fur an apology . In connection with this matter , I wish to place on record at this time my most bumble and contrite apologies for the imperialistic altitude which I adopted and carried out during the period I had extraterritorial rights and was municipal advocate . I realize that the unequal treaties have been abolished ; that foreikmera in Chinn ani on the same basis with Chinese : that foreigners have no special privilegiw and that the most-la v retl ? nal ' daunts. in the old treaties no longer toilet . I have been very well treated alnco I have been confined here , and I hereby ex press toy appreciation to the People 's GOVI.MIT101111 I pray that Ilie People 's I Itivernment will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to my 1101111. country . Again apologizing , I um , Yount respectfully , R. T. ! IOWAN , The guards took my letter and went . away . That night I overheard them talking . One of them said , " The man in this cell will be executed tomorrow morning . He is going to he taken to Kiang Wan , where he will he shot . " For the rest of the night , I could n't ' deep . I thought that this was the end , that I had been tricked into an apology . But next morning , much to my surprise , the guards came for the prisoner in the next cell . In the afternoon the chairman sent for me . Standing over me , he brought his hand down again and again , exclaiming , " You are a spy ; a spy ! You deserve to be executed . Death is the only thing you 're worthy of . " I reminded him that I had apologized . " That 's all nonsense ! " he stormed . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get out of here ! " I never saw this chairman again . After 1 was thrown back into my cell , I remained in solitary confinement for live months ? from February twenty-seventh to July fourteenth . The monotony was endless . In t he morning before daylight , a whistle blew and a guard passed a straw broom through the bars of my door . After I swept the floor , he took the broom and handed in my toothbrush and a small trough of hot water . After the toot hhrush came the rice and pickled cabbage . I smelled foul by now , and several times tried to collect enough water from my meals to wash myself . Once the guard saw me sponging myself , rushed in and seized my towel . " Bathing is against the rules ! " he stormed . " Prisoners do n't bathe any more than animals ! " Then he lapsed into an absurd discussion of monkeys . M mkeys , he observed , have hair like humans , and monkeys do n't bathe . And yet the monkey lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fell into his mood . I said that I 'd hat bed all my life , as most Americans did , and that if I did n't bathe , I might get . sick . ( I ... lit 1 fnan Page 59 ) " Well , that 's nonsense , " he told me . " Chinese do not bathe except in summertime . Why should you bathe , you imperialist ? If you bathe you will catch cold . And besides , prisoners ere not allowed to bathe . " Prisoners , apparently , were also not allowed to wear gliuniea . My headache 's continued and almost every day I Jerked for my glasses . " Chinese prisoners do n't wear glasses . " he said . " It 's against the rules . If you have glasses , you will break them , take the glares , cut your veins ' and bleed to death . " I prayed and prayed , recalling the troubles of Job and wondering if I would survive my own tribulations . Several times I was transferred from one cell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back end of my cell . It broke and fell down on my head , scattering glass all over . The guards rushed in and abused me for destroying prison property . In June I was transferred to a cell which had a broken stool . The guards declared that I had broken the prison 's stool and promised vengeance . In solitary confinement , any human voice becomes valuable . By now , the guards were beginning to take me for granted , and I got to know two of them . One was called Lao Hu , or the " Tiger . " He was a former coolie , a North of the River man who spoke a mixture of Mandarin and Cantonese . Compared to the other guards , he seemed surprisingly decent . He was n't always cursing and yelling . The Tiger 's best friend was called Hsiao Wu Kuei , or the " Small Turtle , " a short , stocky Chinese from Shanghai . The Tiger and the Small Turtle were always boasting about their prowess with women . At night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cell , telling about their week ends , The Tiger spoke at great length of a certain girl named Lotus . describing his success with her in infinite detail . The Small Turtle listened impatiently until his turn came to talk of White Lily . According to him , White Lily was more remarkable than Lotus . After a time , this conversat ion jarred on my nerves and I told the guards I hat they were simply " Mai nru. ' blowing on the cowsk in , " or . as college boys put it . " shooting I he bull . " The Tiger did n't seem to mind and , in fact , took an interest in me . I remember several discussions we had about smells . By this time I realized how badly I smelled , a smell directly resulting from my diet of rice and cabbage . Since this is the usual communist diet , I 'll always associate the smell with my persecutors . One day I called the Tiger aside . " Tiger , " I said , " I need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a matter of fact , you need a bath too . " The Tiger agreed with me that a lot of people stank in the prison . but was hard to convince that he stank too . Finally , however , he seemed to believe me . The next day , he came back to the cell and said , " Bo Liang . I have bathed myself . Now I stink no longer . " But the Tiger still stank . He was hurt when I advised him that his stench persisted because he had neglected to change his clothes after bathing . The Tiger and the Small Turtle were a relief from the other guards , who continued to browbeat me . Meanwhile , I prayed to God for guidance , asking His help for my release , asking Him to care for my wife , Gertrude . I reviewed every aspect of my case , determined to find some way to appeal . In spring , my health was deteriorating , but somehow my energies seemed to return and I began writing letters pleading my case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote approximately eighty letters to the prison officials , mostly on Chinese toilet paper which the guards permitted me to buy . My letters went out . like massages cast to sea in II betMIR never any reply . At ! NO li , I decided In take action . I had no choice . I began to revoguize more frightening symptoms than beriberi , the dietary disease which now crippled my legs . Even the guards noticed my behavior , and I felt as if I were ' slipping . " What are you doing ' ? " the guards would tick , and I replied in Chinese , " Tsseyea L7.4 ? ya ? I am talking to myself . " The weather was getting hotter and hotter and it rained n good bit . The heat and dampness in the cell were oppressive . At night the guards began pounding on my door again to see if I was all right . One night they became very excited when I went to sleep with a handkerchief over my face to keep out the light . ea I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide . I had brooded about this for some time , not with any intention of doing myself in , but simply recalling the enormous concern of the communists for suicide and the ancient . Chinese doctrine of " losing face . " For instance , if a Chinese wronged a friend , the friend might commit suicide on the doorstep of his house , thus causing the person who wronged him to lose face . My guards seemed enormously con-cerned with my survival . Perhaps I could urge the threat of suicide to obtain my freedom . Thinking in this manner , I decided to go on a hunger strike . I had read a good bit about Gandhi 's hunger strikes against the British and the electrifying effect they had . I knew I would n't have trouble turning down my daily ration , since rice and cabbage now revolted me . When I entered the Ward Road Jail , my waist was Sire 38 . Now I had lost so much weight I had to tie a knot in my trousers to keep them up . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took action . On the morning of July twelfth , exactly live months from the day of my imprisonment , I started my fast . The trusty came around and shoved the usual rice and cabbage through the bare . ' ' Take it away , " I told him . " I 'm not hungry for that garbage and I 'm not going to eat . " He went away , but returned in ten minutes to nee if I had eaten . I had n't touched the food . " You 'd better eat , " he aa id , " or I 'll have to tell the guards . " " Go aliend , " I said . " Go tell the guards . " The uproar was immediate . The Tiger and the S II Turtle hurried over . " Bo hiring , " said the Tiger . " you 'd bolter eat . " I 'm not hungry , " I said . " Thal ' a nonsense , you imperialist , " maid the Small Turtle excitedly . " fru- perialiats always eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the cor-poral of the guard arrived . I had heard him called Lung , or the " Dragon . " He one a thin , mean-looking man , who spoke that mongrel Hupeh dialect , and he was very upset . " If you do n't eat , I wo n't be polite , " the Dragon told me . He meant , I 'm sure , that I 'd be taken out and tortured . " Well , " I said , " you 're not polite to me anyway . I think you are extremely impolite . " The corporal went away very angry , and then a fat guard came up . " Do n't pay too much attention to the cor-poral , " said the fat guard . " He 's just trying to frighten you , but we know he ca n't do that . We just want you to eat . We do n't want you to die on our hands . " I 'd as soon die as eat this garbage . " I told him . " That 's not garbage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . " " Well , you never got fat on that slop , " I said . You must get some other food. - " I 'm not supposed to . " said the fat guard . Then the Small Turtle came back . He talked and talked and talked , first politely , and then yelling frantically at me to eat . He called me every abusive name in the Chinese ' language , some I had n't heard since childhood , and I came back at him with all the invective I 'd learned in fifty-eight years . Finally he had enough and left . And then the Tiger returned . arguing in a friendly , polite way . He pointed out that if I did n't eat , eventually I would die . I presented my case to him . I asked him what he thought of a gov-ernment that did n't even answer a prisoner 's letters . I poured on my com-plaints . I was hieing held in solitary confinement , without any charges against me . I was n't getting a fair hear-ing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen with beriberi . My glasses were taken away and I was suffering from persistent headaches . I had heard nothing from my wife , not even a word of her whereabouts . I was not allowed any parcels from the out-side .

" " No , " I said . " I do n't want a hear-ing . I want to die . " " But maybe I can get you a hear-ing , " he pleaded . " You ca n't get me anything , " I said . " You 're not a real Tiger . You 're only a paper Tiger .
