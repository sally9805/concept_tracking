Black-bearded , with a gold earring in his pierced right ear and gold bangles jangling at his wrists , the man who called himself Ronald Chesney looked every inch the pirate he claimed to be . He habitually arrayed his strapping , 6-ft. 1-in. frame in the generously sweeping gestures of the quarterdeck , and boasted homerically of his vast appetites for food , drink and women . When asked his profession , " Old Ches " would reply with a huge guffaw : " Smuggling . " Men and women in all walks of life fell easy prey to Ches 's flamboyant charms , and after failing to see him for long stretches , old friends would frequently renew acquaintance with a happy smile and the affable greeting : " Hello , you old s.o.b . Been in the jug again ? " The answer , all too often , was yes . <P> A Talent for Forgery . Like many a romantic swashbuckler of fiction , Ches began his life in gentler circumstances-as a brilliant , somewhat slack-jawed mother 's boy named John Donald Merrett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the family circle , sent him to a fine public school , and went herself to Scotland to tend his needs when he entered Edinburgh University . Each night in the privacy of their quarters , Donald practiced the talent that led to his first serious trouble-forging his mother 's name . He soon became expert enough to drain her meager bank account of some 450 , most of which he spent on a local music-hall dancer . <P> <P> Two months after Donald entered col lege , his mother was found shot to death with a .25 automatic which Donald had bought a month before . In a trial which has since become a red-bound volume in the Notable British Trials series , 17-year-old Donald escaped conviction for the murder : the jury 's verdict , under a useful Scots law , was " Not Proven . " But he went to prison for forgery , and after a year , emerged to elope with 17-year-old Isobel Bonar . The honeymoon was scarcely over when the young couple were indicted for fraud . Isobel was acquitted ; Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Donald Merretts , or the Ronald Chesneys as they liked to call themselves , lived high , wide &; handsome , spending most of their time touring the Mediterranean in a luxury yacht , the Armentires . They were often joined in their cruising by Mrs. Chesney 's mother , who called herself " Lady " Mary Menzies . When Donald 's fondness for gay company and Isobel 's fondness for gin at last drove them apart in 1937 , Lady Mary and her daughter went back to London , bought a large house in Ealing , and opened a boardinghouse for genteel elderly ladies and gentlemen . Donald went on to join the navy , served as a torpedo-boat commander . But he ended up as usual , sentenced to nine months ' imprisonment for misappropriation of naval vehicles-for smuggling . <P> The Two Bodies . From then on , Donald was in jail almost as much as he was out . Betweentimes he lived luxuriously , on the profits of his smuggling operations , in well-appointed establishments all over the Continent . Sometimes he found the opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was a welcome visitor with his own latchkey and a place to keep a few possessions , including two submachine guns .
