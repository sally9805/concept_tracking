" For a large American city , " said the Houston Post ( circ. 184,461 ) , " Houston is remarkably free of Communist influences . . . which , from all indications , just do not exist in the city . " Schoolteachers have uncomplainingly taken non-Communist oaths ; no Houstonians have taken refuge behind the Fifth Amendment before a congressional committee ; Houston has neither Red-tinged bookshops nor locally published pink magazines . Nevertheless , said the Post , a " miasmic fear of Communism . . . has permeated Houston . " In whispering campaigns , patriotic clergymen , educators and schoolteachers have been denounced as Reds , and meeting halls have been closed to visiting speakers on the ground that they were too " controversial . " <P> More than two months ago , the Post* decided to find out who was responsible . City Editor Harry Johnston assigned Rewriteman Ralph O'Leary , 42 , to " take your time , and find out all you can about this thing . " Last week the Post completed an eleven-part series that blamed the Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the " large-scale Red scare in the community . " The 200-odd Minute Women compose " the most powerful organization of its kind in Houston in more than a quarter century " ( i.e. , since the death of the local Ku Klux Klan ) . The Post 's series brought the biggest avalanche of mail the paper has ever received , but its careful , unhysterical tone was a model of how a newspaper can effectively expose irresponsible vigilantism . <P> Garden Clubs The Post started on its series right after the school board dropped Deputy Superintendent of Schools George Ebey ( TIME , July 27 ) as too " controversial , " even though there was never any evidence that he was a Communist or any question of his loyalty . Postmen knew that much of the protest against Ebey came from local women who had once helped prevent Pasadena 's ex-Superintendent of Schools Willard E. Goslin ( " A very controversial figure " ) from speaking in Houston . They had also helped force the schools to ban a U.N . essay contest . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . <P> The Minute Women , founded in 1949 in Norwalk , Conn. , and spearheaded by a Belgian-born sculptress , Suzanne Silvercruys Stevenson ( sister of Belgium 's Ambassador Baron Robert Silvercruys ) , had one of its biggest and most active chapters in Houston . The Minute Women insisted that they did not act as a group , rather as " individuals . " When they first saw Newsman O'Leary , they tape-recorded the interview , and one ex-member even demanded that an FBI man be present for another interview . O'Leary was asked : " We 're 100% pro-American . Are you ? " Much of their work was done by a " telephone chain " system . One member called five others , who in turn made five more calls ; thus within a short time the Minute Women could mobilize as many as 500 telephone callers and keep public officials on the jump 24 hours a day . At meetings of the entire group , there was , said the Post , " no parliamentary procedure , motions from the floor are prohibited , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minute Women , is to prevent being taken over by the Communists , who have even " infiltrated . . . garden clubs .
