Nation 's Top Airman In his thirty years in American military aviation , Gen. Hoyt Sanford Vandenberg rose from a West Point second lieutenant in 1923 ? to become the nation 's top airman as Air Chief of Staff . On April 30 , 1952 , he began serving an extended term of fourteen months as Air Chief of Staff . That post originally had been assigned to him for a four-year term in 1948 . In extending the general 's tenure until June 30 , 1953 , President Truman sought to permit him to round out thirty years of service in the highest rank he had attained . Upon his retirement from the Air Force and as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Vandenberg was succeeded by General Twining , who was named for two years instead of the customary four . The outgoing Chief of Staff was classed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement pay of 4.13,600 yearly , equal to three-fourths of his base pay . He received also a second Oak Leaf Cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for building up the range and power of the Air Force . During his thirty years General Vandenberg saw the fledgling Army Air Corps develop from an adjunct of the Signal Corps into an autonomous striking force on an equal footing with the Army and Navy . His span saw wide development of pistonengined military airplanes of all types , the first supersonic flight , development of the atomic bomb as an aerial and tactical weapon and the completion of research on an atom-powered airplane . He was graduated from the United States Military Academy as a second lieutenant of cavalry . He joined the Army Air Corps immediately and played an active part in World War II and the Korean conflict . As a cadet he was graduated as No. 240 in a class of 41 members , and was known as a " clean sleever " ? one who had not attained even a corporal 's rank . Soon after graduation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Army captain , and the daughter of this marriage made General Vandenberg a grandfather long before he looked like one . For many of his service years he had to contend against a youthful appearance that seemingly conflicted with the high ranks he held . Handsome in appearance , he stood six feet tall and kept himself at a trim 165 pounds . His son , Hoyt S. Vandenberg Jr. , followed him through the Military Academy . Assumed Post at 49 When General Vandenberg became the nation 's leading military airman he was 49 years old . He was born in Milwaukee on Jan. 24 , 1899 . His father , William Collins Vandenberg , was president of a bookbinding company . His father 's brother , Arthur H. Vandenberg , went from newspaper publishing in Grand Rapids to high rank as a leading Republican Senator . General Vandenberg 's father died at the age of 84 in Wellesley , Mass. , on Dec. 12 , 1953 . After graduation at West Point , the young lieutenant filled a number of routine Army assignments in aviation .

He returned to Maxwell Field as an instructor in fighter-plane tactics and remained until June , 1939 , when he was assigned as a captain to the Plans Division of the Air Corps under Gen. H. H. Arnold . In the Washington field his military star began to rise rapidly . Quiet and easy in manner , he acquired a reputation for remaining silent until he had something to say , and then speaking out . In 1942 he was sent to England as a temporary colonel with Lauris Norstad , another temporary colonel who was destined to become a lieutenant general at 41 in the Air Force . Both officers worked on the air plans for the invasion of North Africa , and later participated in that operation . General Vandenberg flew five missions in England and twenty in North Africa . He became Chief of Staff of the Twelfth Air Force in North Africa under Gen. James Doolittle . By 1943 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered back to Washington and was assigned to head an air mission to Moscow . In March , 1944 , he was reassigned to the European Theatre of Operations , and in August of that year he became a temporary major general . Promotion to temporary lieutenant general came in 1945 . When he became a full general at 49 he was the youngest member of the military establishment holding the four-star rank . Made Trips Abroad As he rose in the military hierarchy General Vandenberg 's interest broadened from combat aviation to the wider fields of air strategy , international cooperation and top-level planning among the Western nations . He made frequent trips to Europe , the ' Far East and South America to see first-hand the disposition of American air strength . During World War II he coma manded the United States Ninth ) Air Force , an organization of 400 , - 000 officers and men operating as a tactical force .

He was also a leading figure in the Air Force-Navy fight over carrier-based aviation that was resolved in favor of the Air Force . The controversy over the Arinfed Services Unification Bill found him in a leading role as a champion of unification . " Air power can never win a war by itself , " he said . " The Air Force is one part of an air-land-sea team , on which no one unit is more important than the other two . " Sought to Increase Strength General N , andenberg sought continuously to increase Air Force strength from its low ebb of fortyeight groups before the Korean conflict began in June , 1950 . A month after the outbreak he said the Air Force needed at least sixty-nine groups . Tlighteen months later he said a " rock bottom " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time the Air Force had an authorized strength of ninety-five groups . The Chief of Staff 's last big controversy in the service came just before his retirement , when he opposed Secretary of Defense Wilson on a $5,000,000,000 budget ( reduction for the Air Force . General Vandenberg maintained that the cut backed by Mr. Wilson would reduce American military aviation to a " one-shot Air ' Force " inferior to the Soviet 's . He said it was . another instance of " start-stop " planning of the kind that had impeded Air Force development in previous years . The cut in Air Force appropriations went into effect in July , 1953 , immediately after General Vandenberg 's retirement .
