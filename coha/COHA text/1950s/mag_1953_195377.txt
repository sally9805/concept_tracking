( See Cover ) <P> When Ezra Taft Benson was asked to become Secretary of Agriculture last fall , he told Dwight Eisenhower : " General , no salary in the world could persuade me to take the job . " Benson began to give Ike his reasons . First , he had not supported the Eisenhower nomination , had been for his distant cousin . Bob Taft , instead . Well , said Eisenhower , so were a lot of other patriotic Americans . Secondly , said Benson , he had often voiced doubts as to whether a military man should be in the White House . Answered Eisenhower : All the more reason to get good civilians in the Cabinet-like Benson . Benson 's third reason was the one he felt most strongly : he was a clergyman , one of the Twelve Apostles who guide the Mormon Church . No clergyman should have to take a job where politics might compromise his principles . That was the opening for Ike Eisenhower 's clincher . " Mr. Benson , " said he , " we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. Government . Surely you agree that that is a spiritual job ? " <P> In the eleven weeks since Apostle Benson took office , he has found that his job , if not always spiritual , is one that requires all the fortitude and dedication of a Brigham Young . Benson is a big ( 6 ft. , 220 Ibs. ) , open-faced 53-year-old who looks younger , has the ruddy complexion of one who has spent years in the fields ( which he has ) and the hearty smile and firm handshake of a Boy Scout leader ( which he is ) . He adheres to the old-fashioned philosophy that God helps those who help themselves . Benson quotes the Bible to show how he applies this dictum to farming . Not through Government handouts , says he , but " in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread . " Benson believes that " no real American wants to be subsidized . " For holding to these beliefs Benson has been caught in a whirling political storm . His principles have not been twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mounting . <P> Props &; Prices . Benson has to buck a phalanx of entrenched ( by Civil Service ) Agriculture Department bureaucrats , many of whom have come to think of themselves as the masters of U.S. agriculture . He has to bear responsibilities far heavier than the average citizen realizes . Not only does the law require him to support the price of a dozen commodities , but it also gives him discretionary power to support any farm commodity produced in the U.S. It follows that the Secretary of Agriculture is likely to be blamed by some farmers if the price of any farm commodity drops . <P> The pressure on Benson is vastly multiplied by the fact that when he took office farm prices had been falling for months-and some are still going down . The Eisenhower Administration and Congress have these choices : 1 ) let prices fall ; 2 ) support prices while limiting production by Government fiat ; 3 ) support prices without limiting production , which might mean that the Government would buy a greater and greater share of more and more commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
