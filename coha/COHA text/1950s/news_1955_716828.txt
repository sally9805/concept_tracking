txt Once concentrated entirely at Yonkers , the company now is divided into five units . The first is a new mill , built in 1951. by the City of Greenville , Miss. , equipped by Smith and now leased to the company at a low annual rental . Additional Axminster looms have been moved there from Yonkers , and expectahoos are the mill will be " running smoothly " by the end of next month . It is expected to reach full capacity by Labor Day , perhaps sooner . A still newer mill , at Liberty , S. C. , was acquired last September . It already has been doubled in size , and within a month , the last piece of equipment from Yonkers should be in place . It is now turning out velvet carpets . Meanwhile , the Philadelphia mill , which makes Wilton carpets , is operating three shifts . six days a week . It has been a steady profit maker since its acquisition in 1953 . Yarn-Making Facilities Yarn for the Wilton mill , and now for Liberty , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also being expanded to replace facilities in Yonkers . In New York City are executive headquarters , general sales office and the research department . In due course , a sixth unit will be acquired to make tufted rugs as an integral part of Smith 's production facilities . Explaining the decentralization , Mr. Elliott declares , " We learned the hard way that no management should allow its thinking to become so dominated by bricks and mortar as ours was by Yonkers . " He adds : " It is the philosophy of this management never again to have all our production eggs in one basket . " If you take a tour of the Greenville " basket " with youthful Jack Potts , jaunty , pint-sized plant manager , you 'll get a better idea of why Mr. Elliott and his new team are so confident these policies will pay off . ( What you see here is being repeated on a smaller scale at Liberty . ) Step first into the glistening , tile-walled boiler room , where one man per shift looks after the almost completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shift . Chat with boiler room foreman Harold Day , a former Mississippi River boat engineer , and he 'll laughingly tell you , " This is great ? I know where I 'm going to eat my supper every night of the year . " Walk next onto the 1,000-feet-long loading and unloading dock  --  paralleled by a railroad siding . It replaces six or seven such widelyseparated areas at Yonkers , each with a wool stock room employing one or two men . At Greenville , there is one stock room , operated by two men . From here a door leads into the air-cooled comfort of the yarn mill , where wool is cleaned , combed and spun into yarn for weaving . " Unquestionably the most modern such operation in the country , " Mr. Potts beams proudly . More Modern Equipment As you walk next into the steamy dyehouse , a door opens before you , triggered by an electric eye . This assures the door will close again , saving strain on the air conditioning equipment , and also permitting fork lift trucks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling devices , Mr. Potts points out , was-impossible at Yonkers , where ancient wooden floors , supported by wooden beams , would not safely support motorized trucks . Wander into the weave room , and you 'll see two giant Axminster looms operated by a single attendant . These " realistic work loads , " in Mr. Potts ' words , are another big change from Yonkers . With the exception of one small weaving area there , ' each loom had its own attendant . Mr. Potts 1s equally eloquent about his Mississippi employes ; " The calibre , interest and enthusiasm of these folks is certainly as important as the plant 's technical efficiency . I have never seen people pick up the knack so fast . " If you should take a trip through the nowbarren Yonkers mill , you 'd see a telling symbol of what this means . Throughout the gloomy plant there are big red-and-white signs adman-Wring employes to " Cool Off . Do n't Pop Off . " Similar instructions are conspicuously absent at the gleaming new Southern mills . In more concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the past two years : From a half-mile-long , 56-acre collection of old four and five story buildings at Yonkers , to a 15-acre , one-story mill in Greenville , and a three-acre mill at Liberty ; from production capacity ? of 20 million yards annually ( or nearly 12,000 miles ) in Yonkers , to about 9 million in Gre  --  enville , Liberty and Philadelphia ; from peak employment ( in 1948 ) of 6,500 hourly-wage carpet workers in Yonkers , to a maximum of 2,000 when the two new Southern plants reach capacity later this summer . Mr. Elliot figures the company will save about $4 Million annually in labor costa alone , compared with only two years ago . Noteworthy in the figures on plant space and ' labor force is the fact that while yardage producing capacity of the- new facilities. - is about half that of the old ones , the present plant acreage and labor force is only about a third of that in the old facilities . Dramatic Results Expected The impact of this shrinkage in size on the company 's hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago the company was forced by the high overhead burden of Yonkers to turn out anything it could conceivably sell , with consequent quality and price cutting , it now expects to have " demand pulling on capacity , " Mr. Elliott says . Sales vice president Robert H. Bishop says : " We 're in a position now where , at times . we will have to choose what business to take . That gives us much greater flexibility in meeting changes in the market . " Mr. Elliott adds significantly , " From here on , we are going to be ' trading up ' in quality , getting away from the low-end stuff we had to turn out at Yonkers . " Moreover , the new production facjlities have been built with an eye to " what we know we can profitably sell , on the basis of the past three years ' experience . " That means " normal " operations are on a five-day , threeshift basis . A year ago , Yonkers was operating only two weeks out of four . The ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales force , organized in 12 illstriets  --  compared with 12S men in 21 districts ' two . years ago . Warehousing facilities are being reduced to 10 from 21 ? the latest warehouse , a completely modern , mechanized building , is due to be operating at North Brunswick , N. J. , inside a month . And management also has been slimmed down ? to 11 officers and only three vice presidents , from 13 officers and 11 vice presidents four years ago . In this streamlined executive hierarchy are these new faces , all hired within the past Mir years from a variety of industries : Mr. Elliott , a South Carolinian , was formerly president of John F. Jelke Co .. Chicago margarine maker , and general manager of whisky-making Distillers Corp. - Seagrams , Ltd. ; Leslie Runton , plant ehgtneer , held a similar job for 15 years with ? J. P. Stevens &; Co. , ' Inc. ; Marshall Delavan , hired from Burlington Mills Corp. , as comptroller : Mr. Bishop , a former sales executive of Sylvania Electric Products , Inc. , television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent , ? a production executive for a decade with carpet-producer James Lees &; Sons Co . Most recent addition to this new team is Elliott I. Petersen , who becomes this month operations vice president and Mr. Elliott 's chief assistant . He will be in charge of all manufacturing operations . For the past 10 years , he was manufacturing vice president of Bigelow-Sanford Carpet Co. , Inc. , largest company in the industry .
