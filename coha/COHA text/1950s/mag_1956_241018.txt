Visitors to Mexico are often affronted by dogs whose naked , blotchy skins look as if a loathsome disease had stripped them of their fur . Some of these creatures are really victims of mange or eczema , but others are more or less mixed descendants of the Xoloizcuintle , * the hairless , edible dog of the Aztecs . " Xolos " have been neglected until recently , but last week Norman P. Wright , a onetime British diplomat living in Mexico , was well on the way to establishing them as a rare , high-fashion breed . <P> <P> In pre-Spanish times the Xolos were important to Mexican Indians in many different ways . Young ones could be stuffed with corn and bananas and brought to a hoglike fatness . Since the Indians had no other domestic animals except turkeys and ducks , the fat , hairless Xolo puppies were a leading source of meat . They were raised in large numbers , and a famous dog market near Mexico City sold as many as 400 a week . The Spanish clergy tried to suppress this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish , too . appreciated roast Xolo . Mexico 's famed painter Diego Rivera , who owns 45 hairless dogs , says he has eaten them and found them delicious . <P> <P> Flealess at 104 F. When not used as food , the versatile Xolos had other uses . The Indians believed that they guided the souls of the dead to heaven . Yellow Xolos were best for this job , but those of other colors could roll in yellow mud and do almost as well . They were also useful as sacrifices , and were believed to have important medicinal powers . A Xolo 's temperature is 104 F. , and his skin , bare of insulation , feels hot to the touch . These properties made him useful as a living hot-water bottle , and he harbored no more fleas than if he were made of rubber . When Dog-Fancier Wright began to study the hairless-dog situation , he found Mexico full of peculiar dogs , more or less hairless , and of various shapes and sizes . The few to be found in other countries were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so Wright made three long trips to the primitive parts of tropical Guerrero and managed to buy eight Xolos that matched old pictures and descriptions of the genuine Aztec breed . He found that in remote regions they are still used as hot-water bottles , but he was not offered any roasted puppies . <P> Chaperoned Breed . When freed of ticks and internal parasites , Wright 's eight Xolos throve and multiplied . In cooperation with the Asociacin Canofila Mexicana ( Mexican Kennel Club ) , he set up standards for the breed . A genuine Xolo should have no hair except a slight fuzz on the top of the head and the tip of the tail . The naked skin can be any color ( dark brown or grey is commonest ) , but large blotches of pink are undesirable . The ears should stand up straight . <P> During the first year , the Kennel Club " recognized " only two of Wright 's carefully bred puppies . Later generations , carefully chaperoned , have approached the standard more closely . Now there are 22 recognized Xolos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up to keep unrecognized Xolos , even though of ancient Aztec ancestry , from sullying the breed . Buyers of the real McCoy must sign an agreement to destroy all nonstandard pups . No owner may breed his Xolo without consulting Wright 's committee .
