Florida Thinks She 's Got it Made One sunny afternoon not long ago , in a small plane flying northward out of Miami , Mr. McGregor Smith , chairman of the board of the Florida Power and Light Company , rummaged in a canvas knapsack he habitually carries as a brief case , and drew therefrom a harmonica . Tapping it upon the heel of his hand to clear the keys of any crumbs of pipe tobacco that might be lurking there , he leaned back . closed his eyes , and blew upon it the melting strains of Swanee River . The pilot , Mr. Ken Shotwell , a vice president of Mr. Smith 's company . took no notice of his musical interlude . It was , he knew , Mr. Smith 's custom to blow Swanee River on the mouth organ whenever the mood struck him . He had blown it in Chicago , and Cleveland , and Detroit , at assemblies of amazed tycoons . He had blown it in the sedate board rdoms of New York banking houses , before delivering an eloquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors they should lend him several millions of dollars for expansion . Men who knew Mr. Smith less for his achievements than for his eccentricities  --  lie wears green shirts of venomous hue and black string ties to his office  --  were apt to say of him . " In Miami the weather is balmy , and so is McGregor Smith . " This , however , is an erroneous judgment . Mr. Smith does not blow his harmonica because of the vagaries of a wandering mind , nor to attract attention . He blows it to help himself think . This playing of Swanee River conjures up in his mind the vision of his state which he hopes to convey to those benighted souls in the frozen North who arc unaware of Florida 's present glories and future splendors . The Florida which Mr. Smith sees in his mind 's eye as he plays Swanee River bears no resemblance , of course , to Stephen Foster 's nostalgic dreaming of little huts among the bushes , and banjos strumming , and hers ahumming all around the comb . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a Florida of 10,000,000 people instead of the 4,000 , ( xi0 who live there today : of 15.000,000 tourists , instead of the nearly is , o()0.000 who last year flowed in and out of the peninsula in two great summer and winter tides , The Florida of the future , which Mr. Smith sells so earnestly when he makes his drum-beating forays into the North , still owns its ancient assets of sunlii skies and white beaches , of blur seas and black lagoons aswarm with fish , and of great woodlands teeming with deer and turkeys . But something new has been added , to give the state a firmer economic base than the whim of the visiting millions , who in time of depression tip north might decide they cough no longer afford to spend a billion and a quarter dollars a year on Florida vacations . This something new , as Mr. Smith envisions it , will he thousands of new factories , large and small , making the strange , new , complex gadgets of the electronic age . They will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noxious vapors . They will be as clean as lahoratorirs , as elegant as luxury motels , and they will operate , naturally , on electricity produced by atomic fission . The power from the atom will not come to Florida tomorrow , Mr. Smith admits , no mailer how desperately he would like to find a substitute for the costly black oil his steam plants now must burn by the tanker load . Negotiations begun with such high hopes , between the AEC and a trio of Florida power companies that made up the Florida Nuclear Power Group , have temporarily reached a stalemate over whether the companies or the Government will bear the greater part of the 875,000,000 an atomic-power plant would cost . The best estimates , so far , indicate that atomic power would cost about three times as much per kilowatt as Mr. Smith 's company now charges , and he has no intention of asking his customers to bear such costs . He 's afraid they 'd shoot him or , worse still , run him out of the state , forcing him into exile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the matter of finding somebody to insure a nuclear-power plant at premiums not too fantastically high , and the question of disposing of burned-out reactor cores that are still dangerously radioactive . All these things , of course , will eventually be worked out , and when they are . Mr. Smith says , Florida will enter a new age  --  the age of the atom , the rocket and the missile . " In another twenty years , maybe ten . " says Mr. Smith . whose power plants serve Cape Canaveral . " Florida will be the missile capital of the world . Atomic power , when it comes , and the missile , which is already here , will do for this state what the airplane did for California . " In this bold prediction . Mr. Smith is merely echoing what any visitor to Florida hears , whether he is listening to Governor Lc Roy Collins or to a Miami Beach bus driver . Florida , they point out , has more water than she knows what to do with , but no water power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's flutter wheel . to say nothing of the great turbines of a hydroelectric plant . She has fossils  --  the sandy bottom of famous Silver Springs is littered with mastodon bones  --  but no fossil fuels , such as coal and oil , have yet been found . Ever since the atom first was split , therefore . the state has been waiting hopefully for the unlimited cheap power her citizens fondly believe nuclear fission can provide . To hasten this happy day Governor Collins has allotted 55,000,000 to two state universities for exploratory studies in the peaceful uses of the atom . In this quest , the governor believes , the slate 's clean air has recently earned it an exceedingly lucky break . Harassed by ragweed pollen , which caused him to sneeze violently , Dr. Walter Zinn , one of the world 's leading authorities on atomic-power reactors , resigned his post as director of Argonne National Laboratory , at Chicago , two years ago , and moved to Dunedin , on Florida 's west coast . Financed by a New York group made up largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierce , Fenner &; Beane , he set up his own firm  --  General Nuclear Engineering Corporation , known as " Genie " for short  --  in one wing of a **39;1050;TOOLONG , assisted by a staff of brilliant young physicists and engineers , he is now designing power and research reactors for a dozen clients here and abroad  --  including McGregor Smith and his associates in the Florida Nuclear Power Group . Someday , Mr. Smith is confident , Doctor Zinn will produce the design of a power plant the electrical companies can afford to build , and the millennium Smith envisions when he plays Swance River on his harmonica will have arrived . Though Florida 's interest in the atom as a source of peaceful power goes back to 1942 , when Doctor Zinn under the direction of Enrico Fermi , built the world 's first atomic reactor in the stadium at Chicago , her concept of her destiny as the missile capital of the western world is a more recent revelation . Before the beep of the Soviet Sputnik sent the nation into a frantic scramble to launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canaveral , where rockets were tested and fired . attracted little more attention in Florida than it did in Maine . Now , however . Floridians see Cape Canaveral as the nueleuseof a mammoth missile industry , which , with its subsidiary suppliers , will spread throughout the state . There 's no sense , Floridians argue , in fabricating these great birds somewhere and hauling them to Florida for testing . when any scientist or technician in his right mind would be happy to move to Florida to build them . This willingness of all men everywhere to pack up their goods and chattels and move to Florida the state considers one of its greatest natural assets . When Pratt &; Whitney advertised for engineers , giving them their choice of working in New England , California , Florida or the Midwest , the applications for Florida jobs outdrew the others by more than 20 to 1 . The Pratt &; Whitney Florida plant was located in the heart of a game refuge in the Everglades , a dross ned and isolated wasteland remote from human habitation where the shriek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living creatures except alligators , deer and se-eat blue herons . This proved no handicap to the hiring office , for the amenities of West Palm Beach , and the clean surf of the East coast , were only twenty-odd miles away . When the Glenn Martin company was seeking engineers , technicians and top executives for its new 527,000.000 missile plant at Orlando , it got little response to its ads until the line was inserted . " NI ust be willing to live in Florida . " Then the applications came in a flood . " The whole United States , " says Governor Collins happily . " is Florida 's labor pool . " Aided and abetted by its climate , Florida in the past five years has added nearly 2000 new industries to its list , including such giants as G.E . and Minneapolis-Honeywell . Most of these have gone into the same areas that in the past have been favored by the ( ( wrists  --  Miami , Fort Lauderdale and St. Petersburg . The working population , it seems , in its off-duty hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fishing , water sports and horse and dog tracks that the vacationers find alluring . Inevitably . of course , industrialization is having its effect on a state which once was the epitome of Sleepy Time Down South . Already manufacturing payrolls are pushing oast tourist dollars as a source of income for Floridians , and many a drowsy little tourist resort is prodding the Florida Development Commission , asking the state 's help in bringing a new factory to the town . Sociological patterns are changing too . Diapers now wave from St , Petersburg clotheslines , once the world 's largest Old Folks Home . The lean and skippered pantaloons do n't seem to mind the invasion of the baby-carriage set . In fact , one developer of subdivisions likes to plant a young family with tots of children in each block of homes he builds for retired folk . It helps to keep the old folks happy , he says . They pat the children on the head and make a solicitous fuss over the expectant mothers . " It makes them feel they are still out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backwater , " the builder , a philosophical man , explained . The industrial revolution is also reflected in the swift growth of Florida 's permanent population . It is adding citizens at the rate of five hundred a day . Floridians arc as fecund as anybody else , but this swift increase can not be attributed to the baby crop . Nor is it due to the influx of retired folk , coming to Florida to live out their last days . It is due mainly to the fact that all over the United States young couples are loading their small fry into the station wagon and heading south to make a new life for themselves . Most of them have good job prospects when they come , Others come hunting work , and are willing to do most anything to keep solvent , until they find something that suits them . Many of them find employment that in no way resent blcs their former trades . One Miami homeowner was startled to find that the amiable young man paving his asphalt driveway was a former Madison Avenue advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bookkeeping job ended up happily running a fishing camp . " It is the Land of Beginning Again for a lot of folks , " says Governor Collins , who is always thinking up new ways of describing his state . It is also a land where a man can indulge his whims . One Pennsylvanian , a bulldozer operator by trade , had always had a passionate ambition to own a race horse . He gathered up his wife and his life savings , and came to Miami . where he bought a yearling filly . The 52.25 an hour he now earns driving a road scraper for a real-estate developer buys oats for the filly and pays for its training . He and his wife live on the $100 a week she makes as a waitress . Both they and the horse seem happy . " It may sound crazy , a workingman owning a race horse , " he says . " But I do n't drink and I do n't smoke . I do n't throw my money away , except on that horse . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Sometimes , in Florida , seeming luxuries may be absolute necessities . On Miami Beach there is an elderly cab driver who spends a fourth of his income to rent a cabana at one of the better beach hotels . Fie never uses it himself , but his wife , a chronic invalid from heart trouNe , sits there in the sun all day , quietly watching the sea . " What else could i do ? " he shrugs . " I had a good business up North . But she would n't have lived another six months up there . That cabana keeps me broke . but it keeps her alive . And that 's all I care about . " One of Florida 's great selling points , of course , is based on the claim that the warm Florida sun puts new life in aging tissues and that the clean air relieves young and old of the allergies , wheezes and sniffles that fle , h is heir In in the North . The first point , particularly , seems to be no exaggeration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing nothing more strenuous than baiting a fishhook , after about a year of sun-soaked loafing , find themselves eagerly setting up a small business or spryly hustling about peddling real 99 estate . The state 's most nimble nonagenarian , of course , is Mr. Arthur Vining Davis , the onetime aluminum tycoon . After sixty-eight vigorous years as founder and head of the Aluminum Company of America . Mr. Davis retired to Florida in 194% , at the age of eighty-one . His " retirement " lasted about fifteen minutes . For the past nine years Mr. Davis , now ninety , has been buying , selling and developing huge holdings . building a real-estate empire estimated to be worth some 5200.000.000 . Some of his more grandiose plans he could hardly bring to fruition if he lived to be 120 , but this does not deter him . Florida also likes to boast that its business and political climate is as salubrious as its natural weather . With the politician 's inborn instinct for plucking the goose whose feathers come loose most easily , the state 's tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , rather than the 8,000.000 who visit there each year . There is no state income tax , either personal or corporate , no state tax on personal property , and the inheritance tax takes only a modest bite from the estates of citizens who , despite the rejuvenating sunshine , ultimately pass on . The tax on intangibles is only one mill , which leaves relatively unmolested the stocks , bonds and trust funds on which many retired folk live . es , he bulk of Florida 's 5300,000.000 a year income must come , therefore , from excise taxes . which gives the visitors ample opportunity to contribute . A seven-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline brings in sonic eighty-odd millions a year , Florida 's lawmakers being well aware that 80 per cent of its out-of-state visitors come by automobile ; another 520,000,000 comes from taxes on horse and dog racing , both sports heavily patronized by visitors , and another 532,000,000 derives from the tax on beer and other alcoholic beverages , which again falls largely on the tourists . ( Floridians , in fact , arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per-capita consumption of alcoholic beverages by states . The figures for Florida are based on the state 's permanent population , but the total gallonage includes that consumed by the tourists . The resulting totals would indicate that Florida 's permanent residents stay permanently schnozaled.k None of the above is meant to suggest that Florida looks upon its visitors as geese to he plucked , On the contrary , it treats them with the same tender solicitude with which the United States Fish and Wildlife Service welcomes the wild geese which winter on Florida 's northwest coast . There , some 16,000 Canadas from the snowtields around Hudson Bay settle down , honking happily , on a great refuge along the St. Marks River , where , protected from poachers and predators , they spend the w inter munching corn , rye grass and chola nuts . The geese come down , riding the north wind , under the full moon of October . The tourists , motivated by the same desire to get out of the cold blasts , begin arriving some two months later . They are greeted warmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handsome welcome stations have been set up where the visttor is urged to guzzle all the freshly squeezed orange juice he can hold , and then is plied with information about Florida 's wonders , such as Cypress Gardens , where he can witness a young man water-skiing on the soles of his bare feet . On his way back north he is urged to stop again , for another slug of orange juice . and to rill out a questionnaire . On it he is asked what he liked about Florida , what he did n't like , how long he stayed , how much money he spent , where he came front , and whether he 'd like to come hack to Florida to live . Nearly everybody , when questioned . said they like Florida line , though there were some mild criticisms of the roads , many of which were not engineered to carry the high-speed traffic or today . A few of the squeamish , also . were made uncomfortable by billboards flaunting such incongruous come-ons as SEE PLAN . ' UL Silent  --  Smsowicurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dons AND STEW . Thu , statistics on spending were somewhat surprising . According to the survey averages . the Winter tourist stayed 13 days and spent an average of 55.140 per day . 1 he summer tourist stayed tt days and spent Sb.54 a day . This , of course , seems incredible to anybody who ever tried to make out an expense account after a trip to Florida . The statisticiaos admit the figures look a little funny . However , they add , they include all sorts of tourists , including trailer dwellers who avoided fancy restaurants and fifteen-dollar-a-day motels , and freeloaders who spent a blissful fortnight as the guests of friends and Mat nes . The figures which interest Floridians most were those which indicated that 5,000. ( 00 of last year 's visitors had every intention of coming back to Florida again , and that at least 900,0iX ) of them planned to return to Florida to live permanently . Floridians with money to spend accept these expressed hopes at their face value . In the Miami area alone 575,000,000 worth of new hotels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is talk of building a huge causeway across the lower end of Biscayne Bay which would open up another Gold Coast on the undeveloped islands to the south . Any faint impulse a frostbitten Northerner might have toward spending his sunset years in Florida receives strong encouragement from Florida real-estate men and the building trades . For the past several years Northern publications have been flooded with glowing advertisements extolling the glories of new subdivisions where every prospect pleases and lots may be had for ten dollars down and ten dollars a month . All over the state huge developments are going in  --  on the West Coast , where the more conservative folk seem to congregate : the East Coast , which lures the blither spirits and the well-to-do ; and in Central Florida , which seems to attract those who prefer the shimmer of man-made lakes to the slow tides of the Gulf and the booming Atlantic surf , The result has been an upsurge in Florida land values reaching the proportions of a boom . It has , so far , been a steady , solidly based boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculative frenzy of the ' 20 's , when lots were merely chips in a frenzied poker game , is determined to keep it that way . All advertisements appearing in out-of-state publications must be checked for truth and accuracy by the Florida Real Estate Commission , which sends inspectors to look over each development . " We are trying to kill off the blue-sky boys , " one official said . " We plead with Lite honest real-estate people to police their own business . " The law as written is tough enough . It provides a line not exceeding 5100,000 , or imprisonment not exceeding live years , for any person who publishes , or causes to be published , any " false and misleading information offering for sale , or inducing any other person to buy , real estate located in the state of Florida . " The trouble is , even the wariest of Northerners seem to have the idea that Florida land is worth its weight in diamonds , or will be if they hold on to it awhile . Therefore , they read into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell the truth , " one official complained . " It can say , in so many words , that the development is forty miles from nowhere , that the country club is an ' artist 's conception , ' and that the lake-to-be is still a bog . People still will buy , sight unseen . " The dreamy-eyed acceptance of a press agent 's fantasy as gospel truth is not always so naive as it sounds , Honest builders and developers do turn frog ponds and pine barrens into serenely beautiful subdivisions . In Broward County , north of Miami , a young Indianan named H. B. Layne. a onetime roofer who had made a fortune building prefab houses in the Midwest , paid a million and a quarter dollars of his own money for 5K0 acres of mangrove swamp so dense and dismal it would have terrified an alligator . He drained the morass by cutting deep canals , buried the mangroves under coral rock , poured on topsoil , sodded with grass , and created a complex of high , dry islands , interlaced with channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots range in price from S10,800 to $26.200 and arc selling fan , Mr. Layne built the first house , a modest S100,000 structure with a swimming pool , patio and hi-fi music piped to every room , as a model which he hoped his neighbors would emulate . They are showing a gratifying willingness to do NO . Around Mr. Layne 's residence a community of unpretentious but extremely expensive houses is growing . Mr. Layne figures he will spend about 55.000,000 developing the land , will sell it for around $11,000L000 , and the total value of the once-barren swamp , after the houses , apartments and hotels are upon it , will he about $75 , - 000,000 . Layne 's development , of course , appeals to people of ample resources  --  a Detroit importer of watch parts , a Chicago shopping-center developer , an ice-cream manufacturer from Indiana , a New York adman , a Chicago Heights funeral director . No long-term paper is involved . Mr. Layne sells for 10 per cent down and the rest in thirty days , and the lot buyers find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial spectrum is a huge development at Port Charlotte . near Puma Gorda on the West Coast , There , the Mackie Company , doing business in Florida for fifty years , is converting 80,000 acres of range land into a mammoth subdivision where people of lesser resources also may live surrounded by palm trees , hibiscus and Bougainvillaea , along canals leading to deep watts . Here Ki-by- I 25-foot lots may be bought for 5795 , paid for ten dollars down and ten dollars a month . Purchasers may . of course , hold these lots until they are ready to retire some years hence . If they are ready now , the Mackie firm will build their houses For them at prices ranging from 56000 for a one-bedroomer up to 516,500 for a three-bedroom establishment , with two patios , a skylighted kitchen and an intercom system . Payments for the Tess pretentious houses arc set as low as forty dollars a month . The above , of course , indicates that Florida has long since ceased In be exclusively a playground for the rich . Many an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Macklin , and others , have scattered over South Florida have little more to live on than their monthly Social Security checks . Economists , studying Florida living costs , figure a couple can live comfortably on 5350 a month , provided they avoid the more expensive spas along the Gold Coast , once they 've paid for their house and lot . The pattern of Florida tourism is changing , too , the experts find . The Florida winter visitor used to be a well-heeled tycoon , come to spend the winter at his estate at Palm Beach or Hobe Sound . Today he is just as likely to be a shipping clerk or a sixty-dollar-a-week secretary , coming to Florida to slay a week , on a " package plan . " Under these package arrangements , the vacationer pays the airlines , railroads or bus lines a flat sum covering transportation to and from Florida , plus the costs of a seven-day , six-night stay at a seaside hotel . For ten dollars a day , for example , a winter vacationer can share a double room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner and sight-seeing trips thrown in . The more lordly pleasure domes , of course , do n't encourage package planners during the winter season . They are happy to have them , however , during the fall , summer and late spring , for by this means they can keep their staffs working the year round , instead of trying to recruit new bellmen , cooks and waiters each winter . The Fontainebleau , for example , which gets $46.50 a day for a double room during the winter season , cuts its rate to 547.50 per person per sscek for a double room sold in a summer package . The boom in industry , in home building and in the tourist trade does not mean that one of Florida 's great basic sources of wealth , its agriculture , is being neglected . Citrus growers hasc long since gone to the processing of concentrates . and from Cape Canaveral , where the missiles are launched , one mammoth juice-squeezing plant sends shiploads of orange juice north in specially built tankers , There it is bottled and delivered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everglades muck farmers have lost some of their command of the winter vegetable market , due to the prevalence of the quick-freesing process . but Florida 's big-scale agriculrural operations still bring its farmers and ranchers a per-capita income of some $5100 a year . third highest in the United Stales . The bony cattle which once scrounged for a living on the palmetto flats are rapidly being replaced by a mixed breed of Brahma , Hereford , Angus and Santa Gertrudis . The Mormon Church in the past few years has paid S3,500,000 for 300.000 acres of range land in Osceola County . There the Saints , by planting more nutritious grasses than the native range provides.Aslan to graze a cow to the acre . The Diet lmc Florida cattlemen around Kissimmee. where experiments with heavier beef breeds and new grasses have long been under way , admit that the native Florida grasses lack nutrition . Hovicser , in the tradition of Floridians , who like to view their handicaps as assets , this is seen as a good thing . To assuage his hunger . they say . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes bins to develop an oversized digestive system , and when these highs:flied calves arc sold to Northern feeder lots or to Texas as replacement cattle , they put on bccf at a prodigious rate . A more spectacular development in the field of animal husbandry is taking place on the gently rolling country around Ocala . Thcrc , nineteen racehorse-breeding farms have been established since the war , and the country . with its white fences , big barns , training tracks and green pastures populated by stallions , mares and yearlings is beginning to look like Fayette County . Kentucky , the Thoroughbred capital of the world . All this is vastly gratifying to Carl Rose , a wealthy contractor who has been breeding race horses near Ocala for twenty years . Florida , he says , is uniquely qualified to be a great horse country . The Ocala area is speckled with limestone springs , whose water builds bone , and though the native grasses are weak , this can be cured by planting Pensacola grass , Bahia and coastal Bermuda . The main advantage is that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A colt goes to the pasture with its mother the day it is born , and never suffers the distempers and stomach upsets which afflict a Northern colt when it is shut up in a stall out of the cold . Under Florida 's sunny skies . Mr. Rose says , the education of a young race horse is never interrupted by sleet or snow . Training goes on day after day , and the yearlings , who have short memories , never have a chance to forget what they learned yesterday . Also , Mr. Rose points out , mares in Florida can be bred in February . or March , which means they will drop their foals early in the following year . Since all Thoroughbreds are one year old in the January following their birth , this means that Florida colts may be one or two months older , and therefore bigger , stronger and , presumably , fleeter of foot than their Kentucky cousins when they begin to race as twoyear-olds . Horse players , who are the world 's most avid students of mathematics , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pennsylvania or Delaware horses . This , Mr. Rose admits , is true . It is due , he says , to the fact that the great bloodlines still arc concentrated in the North , but Florida , he insists , will soon catch up by developing swifter racing strains of its own . It hopes to begin this year with Needles , the great Florida-bred stallion who goes to stud for the first time this winter at the Bonnie Heath farms . Needles , first Florida horse to win the Kentucky Derby , Mr. Rose believes will give Florida 's Thoroughbred strains the lift they have needed . Breeders in Florida , he admits , still arc handicapped by a scarcity of top-grade mares , and Kentucky horsemen are reluctant to build up the Florida bloodlines by selling their own great producers . except , of course , at fabulous prices . While Florida 's horse breeders fervently hope to emulate Kentucky 's success in glorifying the Thoroughbred , the state as a whole keeps a contemplative eye on California . seeing in that state 's growth a forecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Wolff , of the University of Miami , show a remarkable similarity in the population patterns of the two states  --  though Florida is trailing about thirty years behind . California began to grow in the mid-I 880 's . Florida was n't discovered by the rest of the United States until the mid-Twenties . Since that time its growth trends has e closely paralleled California 's early development . If the pattern holds for another thirty years , Wolff predicts , Florida by 1985 will have a population of some 10,000,000 , with 4.000.000 of these concentrated in the Miami area . Wars and depressions could , of course , slow down this growth . But nothing . Floridians believe , can stop it . " As long as the sun keeps shining , " says McGregor Smith , tootling a happy grace note on his mouth organ . " we 've got it made . "
