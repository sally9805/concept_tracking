txt In the face of admittedly serious economic problems , the Soviet leadership has decided to tighten the reins of central control on its far-flunE industrial empire . A shake-up in the leadership of the State Commission for Current Planning , announced yesterday , was the latest and most important indication a a trend now under way . While bolstering the state commission with the appointment of Mikhail G. t'erviikhin and six powerful assistants , the Government also gave the commission new broad powers over the country 's industrial activity . Another Soviet planning agency , the State Commission for Long-Range Planning , has not been affected by the personnel shake-up . It is headed by Nikolai K. Baibakov . The recent appointment of Vyacheslav M. Molotov as Minister of State Control fits into the emerging pattern of closer supervision by the leadership over Soviet economic life . A Powerful Ministry Mr. Molotov 's Ministry checks on the fulfillment of Government decisions and can be expected to become a powerful tool in the Government 's decision to eradicate inefficiency and waste . At its meeting just before Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to check more closely on the fulfillment of economic plans " within fixed periods of time . " The laxness with which such checks have been conducted in the last few years has been a target of consideable criticism in party circles . When it ousted Maxim Z. Saburov from his job as chairman of the current planning commission and put M. Pervukhin in , the Government also increased the organization 's authority over Soviet economic life . In addition to its primary function of yearto-year planning of economic developments the commission was also empowered to do the following : cTo assume " operative functions in the handling of current . problems . " ? qTo take responsibility for " insuring the material resources necessary for the fulfillment of plans . " cTo introduce into production the achievements of science and technology . cTo work out plans for subcontracting work among industrial establishments . cTo coordinate economic activities among the regions of the Soviet Union . Control Over Ministries These new powers , especially the authority to assume " operative functions " and to allocate materials , give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to complaints made by the Central Committee in its report about " shortcomings " on the part of ministries in Meeting the " material and technical needs of enterprises . " While it was taking steps to eliminate flaws and looseness in economic administration , the Central Committee found it necessary to recommend " elimination of excessive centralization in economic management . " This took the form of promising , more authority to the fifteen reIniblies that make up the Soviet , Union . The Central Committee also inveighed against " red tape and bureaucratism . " Demands for more local control in carrying out economic development were expressed by officials in many of the republics din the past year . Experience has ' shown that in areas where more autonomy was given , higher production and a more favorable attitude on the part of the people resulted . Local Initiative Spurred It was clear , however , that even if Moscow was willing to grant additional freedom for local initiative in economic mat , tens , it was moving toward even more concentration of authority in this sphere at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers that the midi die links in the Soviet economic chain  --  regional and even ministerial bodies  --  were the ones now under the heaviest pressure from the top as well as from the bottom . In its drive to increase production and cut down waste in the Soviet economy , the Central Committee told Communist party members that they must take a more serious view of their obligation to see that the Government 's goals were attained . It said the party was obligated to urge higher production , but also to " verify the fulfillment of party and Government decisions . " There was an urgent call for " maintenance of stringent discipline " through the entire Soviet economic machine . This combination of more discipline , tighter control ' from the fop coupled with promises of more local authority was advanced under the classic Leninist term of " democratic centralism . " The concept implies that there must be strict party discipline and that decisions of higher bodies are " absolutely binding " on lower bodies .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
