In trying to refund $8 billion of ten-year , 2% World War II bonds , Treasury 's George Humphrey faced a problem . Many experts predicted that anywhere from $1.5 to $2 billion of the maturing bonds would be cashed , forcing him to raise that much new money . Instead , Humphrey offered bondholders a choice of new one-year certificates paying 2 ? % interest , or 3-year notes paying 2 ? % . Last week he announced that 59% of the bonds had been turned in for one-year certificates . Moreover , 38% were exchanged for the 3-year notes , and only $263 million actually had to be paid in cash .
