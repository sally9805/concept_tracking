To the sober , civic-conscious Kansas City Star , the city 's school system was in " a terrible mess . " Moreover , it was attracting unfavorable attention outside Kansas City . Something , cried the Star , had to be done . <P> For two years the people of Kansas City had done nothing at all . For one thing , they had let their schools squeak by without enough money . Every time the school board tried to raise the school levy , they voted it down . Finally , in a desperate economy move last year , the school board pared the school year from 40 weeks down to 34 . <P> That brought down on Kansas City the icy scowl of the powerful North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools . At its meeting three weeks ago , a special committee of the association recommended that Kansas City be dropped from its accredited list . One possible effect of such a blacklisting : Kansas City high-school credits would fall to a discount for college entrance . Quickly Kansas City appealed , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levy by 38% . The N.C.A.C.S.S. granted a three-month reprieve . <P> With that , the city went to work for its schools . Day after day the Star printed cartoons , pictures and editorials urging the people to vote " Yes . " Locals of the C.I.O. and A.F. of L. bade their members vote the same ; so did the real-estate board , the Merchants Association and the Chamber of Commerce . A lawyer named John . Mc-Evers set up a campaign committee , soon had 9,000 block workers ringing doorbells all over town . Roman Catholic Bishop Joseph Marling threw his weight in favor of more money for the public schools . <P> Last week Kansas City voted . It was one of the biggest turnouts in a school referendum in the city 's history . The vote : over 2 to 1 in favor of the levy . After months of inaction , Kansas City had faced reality , had voted enough money to put its schools back on a 40-week season , and to stay off the N.C.A.C.S.S. blacklist.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
