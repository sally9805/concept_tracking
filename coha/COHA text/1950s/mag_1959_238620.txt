While Britain 's postwar generation of Angry Young Men lash themselves into a low-powered tantrum over the grubby , provincial world they have inherited in the Brave New World of socialism , a group of young realist painters , known as the " Kitchen-Sinkers , " celebrate with gusto the seamy world of cluttered kitchen tables precisely because it is " common to everyone . " It is a world in which the plumber is hero , being both " a craftsman and a necessity . " A good part of the Kitchen-Sink work looks as if a plumber could have painted it , including some still lifes that focus hard on that hardy piece of English enamelware , the water closet . But at its best the new realism has the effect of a pint of bitter-tart proof that Englishmen can still face life with relish . <P> Changed Scene . Outstanding among the young realists is 31-year-old John Bratby ( TIME , March 12 , 1956 ) , who was called in to paint Gulley Jimson 's big-footed canvases in the film version of Joyce Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mad , " Bratby confessed afterwards , " and springs from God knows where , but when the spotlight 's on me , I feel enormously encouraged . " Last week the spotlight was on Bratby again , with a show in London 's Zwemmer Gallery of 28 new oils , turned out at a stupendous clip in the last seven months . The scene has changed from the gloomy digs he used to occupy with his wife and two children in a house he got rent-free from his in-laws . Recently elected an associate of the august Royal Academy , and sporting a new beard , Bratby has come up in the world . Hit , new background is his own rambling , Victorian house , with cracked swimming pool , in London 's Blackheath district . But the exuberant pictures of the disorderly , newspaper-strewn interiors and the sunflower-choked garden ( often with the face of a Bratby child peering through the stalks ) show that Bratby is still a glutton for life . <P> Garrulous Raconteur . London 's critics hail Bratby as the brightest and best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but a handful of his new paintings . " He can be visually greedy , slightly coarse-grained , literal , shocking in a good-humored , terrier sort of way , " says the Times , " and all these qualities tend to be accounted to him as virtues . " The Guardian 's Eric Newton likes the way " his gluttonous eye devours his surroundings in huge optical mouthfuls , and his restless , untiring hand transfers them to canvas with the garrulous enthusiasm of a born raconteur . " Critics applauded the latest addition to Bratby 's usual drab cast of bohemian friends and family-Brigitte Bardot . Bratby claims no speaking acquaintance , picked her out of a magazine one day when a model failed to show . Of Bratby 's current Bardot pictures , Critic Newton noted : " He has not yet begun ( and perhaps he never will begin ) to learn how to brood . Profundity is therefore beyond his present reach . But daydreaming is at least one step on the way from seeing to brooding . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
