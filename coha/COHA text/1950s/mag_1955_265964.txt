Tradition has it that when hot weather spreads across the land , U.S. business slides into a slump . But in prosperous 1955 , with Americans earning bigger wages , going more places , buying more goods , spending more money than ever before , the season 's usual slump never came . As U.S. businessmen quickened their pace last week for September 's bracing upturn , all signs pointed to the best autumn ever . <P> Summer wages had never been better . <P> July take-home pay for a factory worker with three dependents averaged $69.84 a week , up almost 6% from last year ; for the seventh month in a row U.S. factories hired more workers than they separated . In August new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to 173,300 , the lowest level in two years . Though farm income - the economy 's soft spot-dipped 4% below last year for the first seven months , receipts for July took the normal seasonal gain over June , rose 10% , to $2.1 billion . " Most farmers , " said Under Secretary True D. Morse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Rails . The summer of prosperity meant that Americans could and did enjoy themselves . Resorts were packed with vacationers . At home they snapped up more airconditioners , bought more motorboats , spent more money fixing up homes and lawns and gardens . In mid-August the nation 's department stores showed a 6% sales gain over the comparable week for 1954 . In fact , spending was so free that a cloud of inflation loomed on the horizon . Farm equipment prices moved up ( an average , 6% for Ford Motor Co. , 7% for Caterpillar Tractor Co. and Deere &; Co. ) ; building materials , coal , work clothes and soft goods were edging upward . But Administration economists were carefully watching the trend ( TIME , Aug. 15 ) . <P> Industry caught the spirit of optimism . <P> Dow Chemical Co . President Leland I. Doan , after telling stockholders that 1955 sales were running 18% ahead of 1954 , said : " The outlook has never been better . " Railroads were doing well . Union Pacific turned in a seven-month net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , and Illinois Central lifted its net a thumping 54% to $14 million . With 1956 auto production just getting under way and heavy construction still booming , steelmakers , already at 91.4% of capacity , wondered how they could fill their fall orders . The magazine Iron Age said that the demand for steel would sustain operations at 100% of capacity if only the steelmakers could reach that goal . <P> Roses on Wall Street . On the strength of all the rosy reports , the stock market , after a four-week pause to adjust itself to tightened credit ( TIME , Aug. 29 ) , bulled up again . Metals , railroads and building materials strode ahead , and the Dow-Jones industrial index closed the week at 463.70 , a climb of more than 10 points for the week .
