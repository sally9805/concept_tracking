As the silvery plane taxied to a stop on Rio 's Santos Dumont Airfield , 5,000 waiting citizens rushed toward it . A roar went up as the door opened to frame the bulky figure of Sao Paulo 's Governor Adhemar de Barros . Attendants struggled to push the loading ramp through the crowd . When they got it within two feet of the plane , Adhemar jumped . The crowd applauded wildly . Then Adhemar fought his way , grinning , down the steps to set foot in Rio for the first time in two years . He had come to open his formal campaign for the presidency of Brazil . <P> The Chic &; the Egg . For five days expansive Adhemar treated Rio to a brand of shirt-sleeved , handshaking , backslapping , speechmaking politics such as the city had rarely seen . Dozens of taxis paraded him and his party to the Copacabana Palace Hotel , while sound-trucks prowled the streets announcing his presence . Well-wishers swarming up to his suite forced the hotel 's chic patrons to use the service elevators . Beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> At the University of Brazil 's Medical School , where Physician de Barros got his degree in 1923 , he handed out diplomas to the graduating class . He strode off to inspect the Centro Adhemar de Barros , a free clinic which he supports ; lunched with 200 taxi drivers , dined with Benedito Valladares , chief of President Dutra 's copa e cozinha ( pantry and kitchen ) cabinet . At a churrasco ( gaucho barbecue ) in the working-class district of Penha , someone threw an egg , spattering yolk over Adhemar 's shirt . Snorted Adhemar : " A Communist . " He called twice on Dutra , attended Mass , visited headquarters of his Partido Social Progressista , ate another churrasco in another workers ' bairro . <P> Mr. Fixit . For whatever good it might do , Adhemar was careful to drop in on War Minister Canrobert Pereira da Costa and Brigadeiro Eduardo Gomes , both presidential possibilities themselves . One rumor had him offering the foreign ministry to Elder Statesman Oswaldo Aranha . Said Aranha : " Pooh-pooh . " <P> At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessly in attempts to find candidates of their own , Adhemar , never noted for his humility , turned his ebullient cockiness to good account . He showed off his crowd-drawing prowess at close range , played the self-confident candidate to the hilt . Long after he had flown back to Sao Paulo , a new samba called Adhemar D Jeito ( Adhemar Will Fix It ) blared from Rio 's radios : <P> If there is no rice , if there are no beans If there is no butter to spread on your bread , If you have no shirt to tuck in your jeans , Take hope ! Adhemar d jeito !
