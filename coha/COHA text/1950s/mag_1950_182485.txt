In small towns ( and some large towns ) a high degree of excitement can be generated by the question : Why did Flora-belle get ( or not get ) an invitation to the party ? The diplomats , pundits , newsowls*and unclassified quidnuncs who keep a sharp eye on Communist doings have recently been in a dither about an invitation sent ( or not sent ) by Ho Chi Minh , Red rebel leader of Indo-China , to Tito 's Yugoslavia . <P> Somewhere in Siam is the man who knows the answer : an Indo-Chinese named Nguyen Due Quy , who acts as a kind of underground foreign minister or social secretary for Ho . Last month Nguyen Due Quy sent an invitation to all the " people 's democracies " ( i.e. , Soviet stooge nations ) asking them to recognize Ho 's gang as the government of Indo-China , or Viet Nam , as it is now called . Whether at Ho 's orders or by carelessness , Nguyen Due Quy included Tito in the list . Eyebrows rose . Everyone ( possibly excepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people 's democracy ; he had lost his good name in Communist circles and was no better than a fascist beast ( i.e. , a man who disagrees with the Kremlin ) . <P> With joyous alacrity , Tito accepted the invitation , declaring " we should prefer to go naked " rather than betray Yugoslavia 's socialist principles by failing to recognize Ho or by recognizing the legal government of former Emperor Bao Dai , who is on the mailing list of the Western powers . Nguyen Duc Quy replied politely to Tito : " We take good note of your answer . " <P> Did this mean that Ho , who has been recognized by Moscow ( which ought to know him , sce Quy 's friends inside IndoChina tried to erase such an impression ; their radio began to make catty remarks about the purity of Tito 's socialism . Last week Ho 's radio came right out and called Tito " a spy for the American imperialists . " The radio said further that Ho never had had any intention of recognizing Belgrade . <P> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there given a sharp lesson in Communist deportment . Others said that poor Nguyen Due Quy had just neglected to keep his lists up to date . <P> In any event , things were back where they started , except that Tito was ( as they say in small towns ) all dressed up and nowhere to go . <P> *Former newshawks who have ruined their eyesight reading the footnotes in Arnold Toynbee 's A Study of History .
