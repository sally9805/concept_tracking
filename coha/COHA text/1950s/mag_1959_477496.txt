There used to be the notion that Keats was killed by a bad review , that in despair and hopelessness he turned his back to the wall and gave up the struggle against tuberculosis . Later evidence has shown that Keats took his hostile reviews with a considerably more manly calm than we were taught in school , and yet the image of the young , rare talent cut down by venomous reviewers remains firmly fixed in the public mind . The reviewer and critic are still thought of as persons of dangerous acerbity , fickle demons , cruel to youth and blind to new work , bent upon turning the literate public away from freshness and importance out of jealousy , mean conservatism , or whatever . Poor Keats were he living today might suffer a literary death , but it would not be from attack ; instead he might choke on what Emerson called a " mush of concession .

" " A thoroughly mature artist " appears many times a week and often daily ; many are the bringers of those " messages the Free World will ignore at its peril . " The condition of popular reviewing has become so listless , the effect of its agreeable judgments so enervating to the general reading public that the sly publishers of Lolita have tried to stimulate sales by quoting bad reviews along with , to be sure , the usual , repetitive good ones . ( Orville Prescott : " Lolita is undeniably news in the world of books . Unfortunately it is bad news . " And Gilbert Highet : " I am sorry that Lolita was ever published . I am sorry it was ever written . " ) It is not merely the praise of everything in sight ? a special problem in itself ? that vexes and confounds those who look closely at the literary scene , but there is also the unaccountable sluggishness of the New York Times and Herald Tribune Sunday book-review sections . The value and importance of individual books are dizzily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , but the book-review sections as a cultural enterprise are , like a pocket of tmemploymem , in a state of baneful depression insofar as liveliness and interest are concerned . One had not thought they could go downward , since they have always been modest , rather conventional journals . Still , there had been room for a decline in the last few years and the opportunity has been taken . A Sunday morning with the book reviews is often a dismal experience . It is best to be in a state of distracted tolerance when one takes up , particularly , the Herald Tribune Book Review . This publication is not just somewhat mediocre ; it has also a strange , perplexing inadequacy as it dimly comes forth week after week . For the world of books , for readers and writers , the torpor of the New York Times Book Review is more affecting . There come to mind all those high-school English teachers , those faithful librarians and booksellers , those trusting suburbanites , those bright young men and women in the provinces , all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need its direction . The worst result of its decline is that it acts as a sort of hidden dissuader , gently , blandly , respectfully denying whatever vivacious interest there might be in books or in literary matters generally . The flat praise and the faint dissension , the minimal style and the light little article , the absence of involvement , passion , character , eccentricity ? the lack , at last , of the literary tone itself ? have made the New York Times into a provincial literary journal , longer and thicker , but not much different in the end from all those small-town Sunday " Book Pages . " ( The New Yorker , Harper 's , the Atlantic , the news and opinion weeklies , the literary magazines all devote a good deal of space and thought to the reviewing of books . The often awkward and the always variable results should not go unremarked . However , in these magazines the reviews are only a part of the claim upon the reader 's attention , and the peculiar disappointments of the manner in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close study of each magazine as a whole . ) ? COVERAGE " TEAT MIS 1 t is with dismay that one decides the malaise of the popular reviewing publications ? the Times and Tribune and the Saturday Review ? is not always to be laid at the door of commerce . It had been simple and reassuring to believe the pressure of book publishers and booksellers accounted for the hospitable reception of trashy novels , commonplace " think " books , and so on . The publishers needed favorable reviews to use for the display of their product , as an Easter basket needs shredded green paper under the eggs . No one thought the pressure was simpleand direct ; it was imagined to be subtle , practical , basic , that is , having to do with the fact that the advertisements of the publishing business keep the book-review sections going financially . This explanation has , naturally , had an exaggerated acceptance . The truth is , one imagines , that the publishers ? seeing their best and their least products received with a uniform equanimity ? must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being slowly , painlessly killed . Everything is somehow alike , whether it be a routine work of history by a respectable academic , a group of platitudes from the Pentagon , a volume of verse , a work of radical ideas , a work of conservative ideas . Simple " coverage " seems to have won out over the drama of opinion ; " readability , " a cozy little word , has taken the place of the old-fashioned requirement of a good , clear prose style , which is something else . All differences of excellence , of position , of form are blurred by the slumberous acceptance . The blur erases good and bad alike , the conventional and the odd , so that it finally appears that the author like the reviewer really does not have a position . The reviewer 's grace falls upon the rich and the poor alike ; a work which is going to be a best seller , in which the publishers have sunk their fortune , is commended only at greater length than the book from which the publishers hardly expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of democratic euphoria that may do the light book a service but will hardly meet the needs of a serious work . When a book is rebuked , the rebuke is usually nothing more than a quick little jab with the needle , administered in the midst of therapeutic compliments . "  - -  -   - -  -  is sometimes self-consciously arch , " said one review . " But it contains enough of  - -  -   - -  -  's famous wit and style to make American publication worthwhile . . . . " The editors of the reviewing publications no longer seem to be engaged in literature . Books pile up , out they go , and in comes the review . Many cli ? tinguished minds give their names to various long and short articles in the Times , Tribune , and Saturday Review . The wares offered by the better writers are apt , frequently , to he something less than their best . Having awakened to so many gloomy Sundays , they accept their assignments in a co-operative spirit and return a " readable " piece , nothing much , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henry , was asked to write for the popular press and assured he could do anything he pleased " so long as there 's nothing literary in it . " ) 141 The retention of certain disgruntled , repetitive commentators is alone enough to dispute notions of crude commercialism on the part of the reviewing publications . A businesslike editor , a " growing ' . organization ? such as we are always reading about in the press ? would have assessed the protests , if any , and put these fumbling minds out to pasture For instance , what could be more tiresome than J. Donald Adams 's attacks on poor Lionel Trilling for trying to be interesting on Robert Frost ? Only another attack on Adams , perhaps ? who is , like the pressure of commerce , hardly the real trouble with the Times . Adams is like one of those public monuments only a stranger or someone who has been away for a while takes notice of . What is truly dismaying about the Times and Tribune is the quality of the editing . Recently a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor-inchief of the New York Times Book Review , Mr. Francis Brown . Mr. Brown appears in this exchange as a man with considerable editorial experience in general and very little " feel " for the particular work to which he has been appointed , that is editor of the powerfully important weekly Book Review . Hc , sadly , nowhere in the interview shows a vivid interest or even a sophistication about literary matters , the world of books and writers ? the very least necessary for his position . His approach is modest , na ? ve , and curiously spiritless . In college , he tells us in the interview , he majored in history and subsequently became general editor of Current History . Later he went to Time , where he had " nothing to do with books , " and at last he was chosen to " take a crack at the Book Review . " The interviewer , hinting at some of the defects of the Book Review , wondered if there was n't too much reliance on specialists , a too frequent practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book like it , or about the same country or the same period . Mr. Brown felt that " a field was a field . " When asked to compare our Times Book Review with the Times Literary Supplement in London , Brown opined , " They have a narrow audience and we have a wide one . I think in fiction they are doing the worst of any reputable publication . " This is an astonishing opinion to anyone who has followed the reviews in the London Times and the other English reviewing papers . such as the Sunday Times and the Observer . These papers consistently set a standard intrinsically so much higher than ours that detailed comparison is almost impossible . It is not simply whatmay turn up in an individual review ; it is profoundly a matter of the tone , the seriousness , the independence of mind and temperament . Richard Blackmur in a recent article tells of a conversation with the editor of the Times Literary Supplement who felt that the trouble with the American book reviews was just this lack of a strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would withdraw their advertising because of the disappearance of the bland product being put out at the moment . A description of the Times Literary Supplement , the London publication , by Dwight Macdonald finds that the English paper " seems to be edited and read by people who know who they are and what interests them . That the vast majority of their fellow citizens do not share their interest in the development of English prose , the bibliography of Byelorussia , Andre Gide 's treatment of his wife , the precise relation of folksong and plainsong , and ' the large blot ' in a letter of Dr. Johnson 's which has given much trouble to several of his editors . .. this seems not in any way to trouble them . " REVIEWING AS WRITING I nvariably right opinion is not the only judge of a critic 's powers , although a taste that goes wrong frequently is only allowed to the greatest minds ! In any case , it all depends upon who is right and who is wrong . The communication of the delight and importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very least one would expect from a journal devoted to reviewing of new and old works . Beyond that beginning , the interest of the mind of the individual reviewer is everything . Book reviewing is a form of writing . We do n't pick up the Sunday Times to find out what Mr. Smith thinks of , for instance , Dr. Zhivago . ( It would very likely be Mrs. Smith in the Herald Tribune . ) As the saying goes . What do you have when you find out what Mr. Smith thinks of Dr. Zhivago ? It does matter what an unusual mind , capable of presenting fresh ideas in a vivid and original and interesting manner , thinks of books as they appear . For sheer information , a somewhat expanded publisher 's list would do just as well as a good many of the reviews that appear weekly . In a study of book reviewing done at Wayne University , we find that our old faithful , the eternally " favorable review , " holds his own with all the stamina we have learned to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review Digest in 1956 were favorable . A much more interesting figure is that 44.3 per cent were non-committal ! The bare meaning of " review " would strongly incline most people to the production of an opinion of some sort and so the reluctance of the non-committal reviewers to perform is a fact of great perplexity . The unfavorable reviews number 4.7 per cent . ONE SUNDAY A Sunday some months ago in the Herald Tribune . The following are excerpts from five reviews of current novels , reviews that sadly call to mind a teen-age theme . ( 1 ) " The real value of the novel lies in its awareness of character , the essential personality , and the subtle effect of time . " ( 2 ) " Occasionally some of the workings of the story seem contrived . but this is only a first impression , for foremost of all is the re-creation of an atmosphere which is so strong that it dictates a destiny . " ( 3 ) " Miss  - -  -  writes well , telling the story with a matter-of-faciness and vividness that help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reader who relishes a touch of the macabre , it is an intriguing exploration of the imagination . "  --  , however , is an interesting and swiftly moving book ; more complicated than most of its kind , and with subtler shading to its characters . It makes good reading . " ( 5 ) " It is also ; within the framework  --   --  has set for himself , a warm , continuously interesting story of what can happen to a grout of ordinary people in a perilous situation , a situation , incidentally , at least as likely as the one Nevil Shute postulates in ' On the Beach . ' " ( " The one Nevil Shute postulates in ' On the Beach ' " ? the assurance of this phrase would give many a reader a pause , reminding us , as it does , that there are all kinds of examples of what is called " obscurity of reference . " ) About the Saturday Review , one feels more and more that it is not happy in its job . It is moody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to hit the big time . " Of Literature " has been dropped from the title , an excision the miscellaneous contents of the magazine soundly justifies . The search for feature ideas is as energetic as that of any national magazine ; the editors are frantically trying to keep up with the times . With the huge increase in phonograph-record sales , the music departments have absorbed more and more space in the journal . Travel , in all its manifestations , has become an important concern ? travel books , travel advice , guides to nearly as many events as Cue tries to handle . Even thisis not enough . There are Racing Car issues and SR Goes to the Kitchen . Extraordinary promotion ideas occur to the staff , such as the Saturday Review Annual Advertising Award . Lines from an article on this topic read : Because Saturday Review is continually concerned with the communications pattern in the United States , it has observed with deep interest the progressive development of advertising as a medium . of idea communication , a much more subtle skill even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature " a photograph of Joanne Woodward and recently in an issue that featured Max Eastman 's written ideas on Hemingway , not Eastman , but Hemingway , wearing a turtle-neck sweater , gazed from the cover in a " photo-portrait . " The book reviews , the long and the short articles , in Saturday Review are neither better nor worse than those of theTimes ; they are marked by the same lack of strenuous effort . They obviously have their audience in mind ? one , it is believed , that will take only so much . EDITORS ' WISHES L iterary journalism reaches , in the case of a good many writers , such levels of vitality and importance and delight that the excuse of the fleeting moment , the pressure of time , the needs of a large public can not be accepted , as the editors would have us do . Orville Prescott of the daily Times ? is he to be accounted a casualty of speed ? Is what is wanting in this critic simply time to write , a month rather than a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prescott review , but that it would produce a more constant inspiration is open to doubt . Richard Rovere mentioned somewhere recently the fact that he could find , today , great fascination in reading some casual article done by Edmund ' Wilson in 1924 for Vanity Fair or the New Republic . The longer essays Wilson has done in recent years on whatever topic engages his mind are literary works one could hardly expect regularly or even rarely in the Times , Tribune , or Saturday Review . Still , his earlier reviews are the sort of high possibility an editor would , or so one imagines , have in mind . Nothing matters more than the kind of thing the editor would like if he could have his wish . Editorial wishes always partly come true . Does the editor of the Times Book Review really yearn for a superb writer like V. S. Pritchett , who does write almost weekly short pieces in the New Statesman with a week after week brilliance that astonishes everyone ? Pritchett is just as good on The James Dean Myth- or Ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this the kind of thing our journals hope for , or is it a light little piece by , say , Elizabeth Janeway on " Caught between books " ? It is typical of the editorial mind of the Times that it most frequently assigns Pritchett to write a casual , light London letter , work of insignificant journalism , which makes little use of his unique talents for writing book reviews . In the end it is publicity that sells books and book reviews are only , at their most , the great toe of the giant . For some recurrent best sellers like Frances Parkinson Keyes and Frank Yerby the readers would no more ask for a good review before giving their approval and their money than a parent would insist upon public acceptance before giving his new baby a kiss . The book publishing and selling business is a very complicated one . Think of those publishers in businesslike pursuit of the erotic novel who would , we can be sure , have turned down Lolita as not the right kind of sex . It is easy enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established fact , to work out a convincing reason for the public 's enthusiasm . But , before the fact has happened , the business is mysterious , chancy , unpredictable .
