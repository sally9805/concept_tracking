" Need we cavil at the small price we have paid for a bloodless revolution which has affected the destinies of millions of our peoples ? " With this eloquent plea , Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel last year won over reluctant Congressmen to his plan for pensioning off India 's princes . In return , the princes peacefully turned over their 587,888 square miles and 88 million subjects to republican administration . Last week in a white paper , Patel 's Ministry of States disclosed the " small price " : 56 million rupees ( some $2,600,000 ) a year in " purses " paid out to 283 princes . <P> The price was low , at that . The princes have not only taken a 75% cut in income , they have also surrendered to the government at least 700 million rupees ' worth of securities , palaces and lands . <P> New Delhi has promised the princes " the continuances of their rights , dignities and privileges . " These include ceremonial salutes ( 9 to 21 guns , depending on rank and custom ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to be called Your Highness . Each prince is allowed one palace for everyday living and a second palace at a seashore or hill resort . The fattest purse goes to the Nizam of Hyderabad , fabled richest man in the world , who gets 5,000,000 rupees a year . The leanest , 192 rupees , goes to the Talukdar of Kadodia , lord of a tiny village in the Kathiawar desert . <P> Many princes have already changed their way of living . Last November the Maharaja of Jodhpur ( 1,750,000 rupees a year ) moved with his Scottish wife from London 's Claridge 's to a small hotel which charges him only $2 a day . In the past , on Hindu festivals wealthy princes used to stage huge processions with elephants and camels . Now the maharajas ' high-born pachyderms are out in the fields working for a living . <P> Recently , some of the princes joined Bombay society for one of their last flings . The occasion was the splendid wedding of 19-year-old Prince Karam Singh , heir to the Maharaja of Kashmir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary Premier of Nepal ( see cut ) . The wedding was carried out according to ancient Vedic rites , and lasted all day . In the evening the bride 's father gave a huge reception on the brightly lit grounds of his mansion , served rare pates , caviar and native delicacies . Republican India will not see many more such shows .
