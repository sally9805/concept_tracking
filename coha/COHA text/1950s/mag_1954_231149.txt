At the American Physical Society Convention in Seattle last week , Dr. Marcel Schein of the University of Chicago had news to make even a sensation-jaded physicist draw a sharp breath . Last winter , he reported , he and his assistants tied a pack of photographic plates to a balloon , sent them up to 100,000 ft. over Texas to be exposed to the powerful primary cosmic rays that bombard the top of the atmosphere . Later , studying the plates in the laboratory , Dr. Schein got more and more excited as he followed a peculiar ray track through the pack . The track was a bundle of slim Vs made by pairs of negative and positive electrons and there was no trace of larger charged particles ( e.g. , protons ) usually present . His cautious conclusion : " something " had hit the film pack with the unheard-of energy of 10 million billion electron-volts . <P> This was energy of a wholly different magnitude from any ever observed in atomic particles-more than 1,500,000 times the energy of the particles shot out by the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy of a splitting uranium atom in an Abomb . The " something , " Physicist Schein thought , was most probably an illusive particle called an antiproton ( negative proton ) , which theoretical physicists have long guessed about , but never observed . <P> He believes that it hit an ordinary proton in the aluminum wrapping of the film pack and annihilated not only itself but the earthly matter in its target as well , turning all of their mass into energy . <P> The peculiar track was made by enormously powerful gamma rays that created electron-positron pairs as they streaked away from the site of the collision . <P> Like most careful physicists , Dr. Schein does not like to speculate about the possible origin of antiprotons . It is quite possible , says he , that remote stars may be made of " reversed matter , " whose atoms have negative antiprotons in their nuclei and positrons ( positive electrons ) revolving around them . There would be no way to tell ; the reversed matter would send out the same kind of light as ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stayed at home . But if particles from an antiproton star should wander into a region , like the earth 's atmosphere , where the other kind of matter abounds , they would not live to tell the tale except in gamma rays .
