In Manhattan last week , the TV industry was mulling over the advice of a practicing psychologist . Vienna-born Dr. Ernest Dichter had told his 60-odd corporate clients that U.S. women who claim they do n't like daytime TV are only fooling . <P> Psychologist Dichter* arrived at this conclusion , not by asking women questions and totting up the answers , but by letting them " ramble on . " He explained : " We use a free association technique . " Added his pressagent : " Dr. Dichter 's conducting a revolution against pure statistics . " <P> By thus plumbing the female subconscious , Psychologist Dichter decided that what kept women from watching pure entertainment programs in the daytime was 1 ) fear of temptation and resultant loss of work time , 2 ) guilt feelings if work is not finished , and 3 ) fear of loss of recognition as a " sacrificing housewife . " On the other hand , Dr. Dichter believes that women would be bored stiff by " domestic and educational " programs . His conclusion , a tip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shows must be labeled as " educational " but actually be " camouflaged entertainment . " <P> *Dr . Dichter made another notable survey for American Airlines , to explain why many people had never ridden in planes . A main reason , announced Dichter , was fear of " posthumous embarrassment " - i.e. , people do n't mind being killed in a crash as much as they worry about friends who might say complacently : " Well , I told him never to go up in a plane .
