" You call yourself a metal man ? " Buster would ask , stuffingthe cigar between his teeth with an angry snap . " You want to get metal finisher 's pay and you let a job like that go through ? " His eyes glinting with rage behind his thick spectacles , Buster would gesticulate at one of Walter 's cars , freshly speckled with chalk marks as it swung in the air . " Get going on it ! " And Walter would hurl himself at the job , dashing the sweat from his brow with the back of his gloved hand and filing away in a clumsy fury . By the time he had somehow or other repaired what he had left undone , he would find on hastening back to the line that he was far behind once again in his regular work , so far behind that it might take him the better part of an hour to gradually work his way back on the line to where he really belonged , safe for the moment from shouted complaints . Inevitably the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his condition . Of the two other metal finishers who worked on the line with him , one was a dour , fattish man , a leader in the opposition of the local union and disgusted because it did nothing to provide security for probationary employees like Walter . " I 'll tell you something else . There 's countries where a bright young hard-working fellow like you , that wants to go to college , does n't have to waste the best years of his life in factory work just to save the money for college fees . He gets sent right through school and the government foots thep49bills . All he has to do is show that he 's got the stuff and his future is secure . " Walter allowed that this sounded fine , although " having the stuff " sounded uncomfortably like his father 's eulogies of life in America , but he could not see what practical good it did him here and now  --  unless he was supposed to get satisfaction from the bitterness of knowing that in mysteriousother countries his opposite numbers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lean , efficient , sardonic man , had been listening silently to this talk of free college careers . He put his wiry hand inside his open-necked khaki shirt , scratched the coarse curling hair below his throat , and laughed aloud . " What 's the matter ? " asked his fattish colleague suspiciously . " You think your propaganda 's going to change this boy 's ideas about the other side of the world , when everything here tells him he 's got it so good ? " He tapped the fat man on the shoulder with the butt end of his file as patronizingly as if he were patting him on the head . " Even if he has to suffer for his education in a way that should n't be necessary , he 's free . He can blunder around and maybe even learn something that is n't listed in the college catalogues . Those poor kids you want him to envy , they may be getting their college for nothing , but they 're paying a higher price for it than this fellow ever will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably do n't even know what the price is. "  |p50And  he turned back to his work without giving the fat man a chance to reply . Fortunately for the three of them , the fat metal finisher was transferred . He was only replaced , however , by an intenseworker with two vertical wrinkles between his brows , who watched Walter 's ineffectual work with growing impatience . At last he could stand it no more . " In this game , kid , the knack of it is in the speed . The speed , " he said fiercely , " and the way you concentrate on the job . If you 're going to fumble around and just bitch about your mistakes , you 'll be a long time getting straightenedout . " He greeted his own badly dented job , rolling towardsthem , with a smile of genuine pleasure . " Size it up quick , pick out the worst dents , and get going on them right away . Leave the high spots for last  --  the pick-up men do n't mind doing them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no one seemed to know , had been listening quietly , with a strange , mild grin on his long and youthful face . He put a stick of chewing gum in his mouth , ruminatedfor a moment , and said : " What you really want is for him to enjoy his work , Orrin . Might be more practical if you 'd get down and actually show him how to do it . Here , hold on a minute , Walter . " Walter had been squatting on his haunches before the wheel housing of his job , blindly pounding with a hammer at his hidden screwdriver , trying hopelessly to punch a hole underneath so that with the screwdriver he could dig out ap51deep dent as the others did , trying so hopelessly that as he smashed the hammer against his left hand , missing the butt end of the screwdriver , he had to squeeze his eyes to keep the tears from starting forth . " Give me that screwdriver . " Handing up the tool to the laconic man , Walter noticed for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old flag , on his right forearm : an American eagle , claws gripping his wrist , beak opened triumphantly at the elbow  --  you could almost hear it screaming . Without a word the man took the screwdriver and swiftly pressed it to a grinding wheel , fashioning a beveled point . " Try it now . " Walter stuck the screwdriver under the car , rapped at it smartly several times  --  bang ! it was through and resting against the outer skin of the car , just at the very dent . Gratefully , he turned to the gray-haired man , but the man was gone , like a mirage . There was something miragelike about him , anyway . He drove to and from work alone , he never engaged in small talk , he never hung around with a group at lunch hour or before work , he kept a paper book in the hip pocket of his khaki trousers , and always when he was not concentrating on his own work , when he was watching Walter or listening to the others handing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long narrow youthful face . What was more , his cold blue eye seemed always to be on Walter , sizing him up , watching not so much his work , as everyonep52else did , but his temperament and his personality . It made him uncomfortable . Gradually Walter began to sort out the other men around him , the ones who had more common reality in their talk and their tastes . Most companionable of them all was Kevin , the former rural schoolteacher , now an immigrant hook man . His accent was so delightful , his turns of speech so happy , that Walter engaged the towering redhead in conversationat every opportunity . " Hey , Kevin , " he shouted at him one day , " how old were those kids you taught in County Kerry ? " " Ah , Walter , " Kevin sighed , showing his long white teeth as he spoke , " they were n't all such children . if you were to see some of the older girls  --  quite well-developed , they were . Oh , how shameful if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Kevin laughed at the memory , Walter at the picture the big fellow conjured up of countryside lust ; he turned around and there was the gray-haired metal finisher , smilingtoo , but so coldly you would have thought him a scientist observing a successful experiment . It was chilling , and yet not wholly unpleasant . In a way that he could not define , Walter felt that he was being judged and approved . This third man , reserved and anonymous as ever , continued to observe him as Walter chatted not only with Kevin and the second metal finisher but with all of the other men on their line . Conversation was necessarily shouted andp53fragmentary , but Walter was astonished at how intimacies could be revealed in the course of a few phrases : " A man 's a fool to get married . " " Grab the overtime while you can . In the auto industry you never know when you 'll be laid off . " " Happiest time of my life was when I was in the army . " " Only reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trade . " " I came here out of curiosity , but my curiosity 's all used up . " My wife says if I quit I 'll have a better chance to line up a construction job . " " Walter , do n't turn out like those college men who can tell you how to do everything but ca n't do a damn thing themselves . " The only one to rebuff Walter 's friendly overtures was Pop , the seamy-faced little inspector with a rooster 's ruff of yellowing white hair that rose and tumbled down over his forehead , and sunken old lips from which depended miraculously a heavy , unlighted cigar . Wizened , pale , and bloodless , he regarded Walter , for no apparent reason , with bottomless contempt . With a little cap perched sideways on his Niagara of a head like a precarious canoe , and a soft brown cloth knotted about the hand with which he probed Walter 's work for defects and omissions , he seemed to Walter like some strange and hateful gnome . " Kids like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | " they come and go . Twenty-three years I 'm here , and I seen a million like you . Not steady , not reliable , do n't want to learn , just out for fun . You 'll never make a metal man . " I do n't want to be a metal man , Walter wanted to reply ; I just want to make my money and get out of here . But this was , he knew , just what Pop was goading him to say , so he held his tongue . A moment later he was glad that he had , for he was startled to hear the third metal finisher address him . " Pop is an exception , " he said , bending over Walter 's car and scrubbing at it with his sandpaper as he spoke . " By and large there is a democracy of age in the factory . Men who have been here since before you were born fought for a union contract guaranteeing equal treatment for you . Ninety days after you start you get the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen years . A man twice your age will treat you as a working partner and an adult . Where else is that true ? " " Yes , " Walter replied angrily , " but Pop  --  " " He 's got reason to be bitter . Someday I 'll tell you why . " He straightened up abruptly and walked away to his own job . But the words he had used reverberated in Walter 's mind . Who was he , with his young-old face and his expressions like " democracy of age " ? Walter asked , but no one seemed to know . Some said he was a seaman and adventurer , and his big tattoo was pointed to as proof , for he had been heard to state himself that he had acquired it in Lourenco Marques ; but others , who had themselves come top55the assembly line from rural homesteads , were positive from clues he had let fall that he had formerly been an itinerant farm laborer ; and there were even those who swore that he was really an educated man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Whoever he was , for the time he had nothing more to say . But Walter felt his presence , for he was always ready to lend a hand , always laconically helpful , always silently observingand listening . One day the younger inspector at the beginning of the line , blowing genial clouds of illegal pipe smoke , gave Waltersome frank and cynical advice . " Been listening to the bosses talking about you , buddy . " He took the pipe from his mouth and formed a fat smoke ring . " Want to know what 's wrong with what you 're do-ing ? " " I guess so , " said Walter dully . " You try too hard . You 're trying to do a good job  --  that 's the worst thing you can do . " Walter stared in bewilderment at the inspector . " But why ? " " They 're interested in pulling production . If you 're going to be running up and down the line all day trying to make every job perfect , you 're just going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is , they 'll look for an excuse to fire you before your probationary period is up , or else they 'll stick you in a routine lower-paying job . " " Then . . . "  | " I 've been here ten years . Believe me "  --  he drew on his pipe once again and smiled disarmingly  --  " they 're not interested in making good cars , they 're interested in making cars . You know what production means ? Volume . And you know what they hired you for ? To camouflage , not to get rid of every flaw . Hide them so they do n't show up after the car 's been through paint , so the customer does n't see them at the dealer 's , and you 'll get along great . " " Camouflage them how ? " " With your sandpaper . With the grinding wheel . If you hit them up and down and then across , final inspection will never know what 's underneath . Make it look good , and confusing . Be a camouflage artist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not help laughing . " Listen , how could you stand it here for ten years ? Every day I think maybe I ought to get out and look for something else . " " For six years , " the inspector said pleasantly , " I was like you . This was going to be just temporary until I found something with a real future . It took me six years to realize that I was going to be spending the rest of my life here  --  it 's like breaking in a wild horse , only with a human being it takes longer . I got married , had three kids , now I 'm buildinga home near the plant . So I make the best of it , I take it easy and I have as much fun as I can , and I hate to see a guy like you breaking his back all for nothing . " Bending over his work , Walter raised his file and heard the inspector 's final shot , lightly enough intended but bear/ing its own weight of bitterness and resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard talking just like you  --  could n't stand the work , going to quit any day  --  and now they 're five- and ten-year men , starting to think about retirement benefits . " Walter could not clarify in his own mind what it was about the inspector 's attitude that increased his desperation , not until his silent partner eased up to him from nowhere and said quietly , " Kind of terrified you , did n't he ? " " Not exactly terrified . " " Just the same , it 's no fun to be doing time and to be told that your sentence just might turn out to be indefinite . Then if you 've got a good imagination you can see yourself gradually getting used to it , even getting to like the routine , so that one day follows another and the first thing you know the wrinkles are there and the kids are grown up and you do n't know where it 's all gone to , your life . " Walter felt himself shuddering . Was it from the blower overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his face ? He said , " I suppose you have to be cynical if you 're going to stay here . " " Day after day your life becomes a joke without any point , a trick that you play on yourself from punching in to punching out . " " But that 's only if you 're an imaginative or a sensitive person . " For the first time , the man 's angular face hardened . " Do n't you think somebody like that inspector had hisp58ambitions ? Do n't you think he still has his man 's pride ? Did you ever figure the cost of the job in terms of what it does to the personality of a clever , intelligent fellow like him ? He says if you 're going to be trapped you might as well make the best of it , and by his lights he may be right . Anyway do n't be too quick to blame him  --  he probably never had the opportunity to save money and go off to college . " No one had ever , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way . He would never again be able to look at a man like the inspector without compassion . Even at home in the evening with his father , whom he could no longer talk to about anything but baseball or the weather ( although they both tried clumsily to broach other more serious topics ) , Walter found that he was viewing this desolate man not just as his father but as a man who had his own miseries ; and this , he knew , was a part of growing up that could not have come about as it had without the influence of his strange friend in the factory . More and more as the weeks passed and exhaustion was gradually overcome by vitality , only to be transformed into monotony , Walter came to feel that only this man could explain the real meaning of the assembly line . But he remainedaloof , insubstantial as a ghost . The more he held to himself , the more Walter was piqued , and determined to make the ghost speak . At last one day he ventured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours stand for , that big bird ? "  |p59The  man smiled with one side of his mouth . " That old bird is the American eagle . " He raised his arm briefly , flexed it , and let it fall to his side . " It 's screaming with rage at what 's happened to the republic . " " What has happened ? " " Where are the guts ? Where 's the drive ? In a place like this a man 's life goes down the drain like scummy water . " " But you 're working here too , " Walter said boldly . The man shook his head slowly , with such finality that there was something elemental about the gesture . " I 'm not a settled-down man . I 'm just passing through . " Walter cleared his throat . " I do n't even know your name . " " Why should you ? Instead of learning names , we refer to the fellow with the bad teeth , or the guy with the blue coveralls . When I work next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being operated on for cancer of the breast and still do n't know his name , it tells me something , not just about him and me , but about the half-connections that are all the factory allows you in the way of friend-ships . " " The old-timers are clubby enough , but everybody else claims they 're here for a limited time . The place is so big and everything seems so temporary that I suppose we do n't feel the need of introducing ourselves . " The older man looked at Walter somberly . " No one who comes here wants to admit that the place has any real connection with his real life . He has to say that he is justp60putting in his time here , and so no matter how friendly he is by nature he has to think of the people around him as essentially strangers , men whom he ca n't even trouble to say good-by to when he quits or gets laid off . " " But your name  --  " " Call me Joe . " Walter pursued him : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe what ? " He smiled again , his long Yankee countenance creasing in a cold grin . " Joe , the vanishing American . " And he turned his back on Walter and bent to his work as the line resumed its endless progress . But he was a curious man , a nosy man , and he was there , listening and leering , when Walter found a minute to respondwithout cursing to a bitter remark of Pop 's . Walter turned on him with the anger he had managed to suppress when speaking to the old inspector . " It 's easy for you to stand there and laugh . You think you 're better than anybody else in the shop . " Joe hitched up his khaki trousers and replied with deliberateanger , " I never claimed that . I just read a little more and ponder a little more than the average fellow . That 's why I do n't laugh at them , I feel sorry for them . If I 'm a little freer , I 've had to make sacrifices for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cryptically , " They punish you one way or they punish you another way . " Walter did not quite understand , but it struck him that these remarks were a prelude to farewell.  |p61He  asked uneasily , " You 're not going to quit ? " " One of these days . Maybe the weather will turn , or I 'll hear of something else , or I 'll have words with Buster . . . " He added with somewhat more warmth , " But I 'll be back  --  if not here , some place like here . You wo n't , though . That 's why I hope you wo n't forget what it was like for the people who made the things you 'll be buying . " Walter cried indignantly : " How could I ? How could I ever forget ? " It seemed to him that the thick scurf of silverthrough which he shuffled as he worked , the glittering waste of lead filings and melted sticks , were so many needles , each carrying its stinging injection of memory  --  of sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boredom . " You forget worse things , do n't you ? Pain , and even death ? You 'll think back on the days when you were slaving away to save money for college , and they 'll strike you as comical , maybe even romantic . " " God forbid ! " Walter laughed . And yet he had suddenly a shivery foretaste of a future beyond the one of which he daydreamed as he worked . When the siren screamed the end of their nine and a half hours , Walter hurled his file and apron into his toolboxand trotted down the aisle toward the time clock . Turningthe corner of the body shop office just as its lights were extinguished , he ran headlong into one of the iron antennae of a fork truck and cried aloud with pain as the metal plate struck his shinbone . Tottering backwards , Walter was sud/denly gripped by the forearm and pulled erect . He turned gratefully and found himself staring into the eyes of Joe . Smarting with soreness and embarrassment , Walter demandedaggressively , " I suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint stubble glinted along Joe 's narrow cheeks . Grayinglike his iron hair , it aged him as it grew . He scraped his hand across it wearily and replied quietly , " Never mind the machinery . Remember the men . The men make the machines , and they make their own tragedies too . Once your own life gets easier , you 'll take it for granted not only that theirs must be easier too , but that they deserve what they get anyway , that some law of natural selection has put you up where you are and them down where they are . " They had reached the clock bay where they took their place meekly in line , waiting to punch out , shuffling forwardevery few seconds while they spoke in low voices . Around them a swarm of men surged toward freedom  --  noisy boys with laughter to spare for the evening ; haggard weary men in their forties ; surly powerful black men in stained coveralls and scrawny brown men chattering in Spanish ; vacant-faced fools with slack jaws and dangling hands ; shrewd-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaflets , and computing their chances of election to positions that would lift them out of the work routine . " Why do they stay ? " " They 're trapped , that 's why . They say everybody 's sup/posed to be , one way or another , but it 's worse to be stuck here . Spending your life on the production line means counting out the minutes , being grateful that Mondays go fast because you 're rested , and hating Tuesdays because the week is so long . It means that you 're paying off forever on all the things you 've been pressured into buying by getting up every day in order to do something you 'd never , never think of doing if it was a matter of choice . It means never having anything to look forward to in all of your working life . " Joe took his card from the rack , clicked it in the time clock , and with a wave of his hand was gone . What was happening , as Walter woke daily to the dawn 's dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed streets to the waiting assembly line , was that his self-pity , so strong that the page blurred before him when he lay in bed reading himself to sleep , was altering into a maturer concern with the fate of others who could not , like himself , set a term to their labor . He began to question the men on the line with him , one after another , to find out how many of them felt as he did about what they were doing for a living . More sure of himself with every passing hour , he moved up and down the line , demanding , whenever there was a moment , an answer to his insistent question : " Do you think anybody likes coming in here to work ? " " Everybody does one day a week  --  payday , " said the solder flower.  | " Not even the bosses , " said the deck fitter . " Do you think anybody with sense would knock himself out in this dirt and noise if it was n't for the money ? " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind of work is ? It 's colored man 's work . But even the colored men are smartening up  --  they turn up their noses at it too unless they get strapped . " Saddened and bewildered by this last comment , Walter turned away from the man who had made it and who had punctuated his bitter remark with a series of thunderous blows on a door that he was fitting . Only Orrin , the second metal finisher , grudgingly admitted that the work was a challenge to him , that the pay was fair , and that there were worse jobs . Behind them all , long-jawed Joe , caught up with his work as usual , stood casually beveling his screwdriver . " I hear you 've been taking a little poll , " he said to Walter . " What 's it to you ? " Walter asked truculently . He was in no mood to be mocked . With apparent irrelevance , Joe replied by demanding , " How come you fixed on being an engineer ? " Walter was taken aback . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " " That 's not reason enough for a fellow to struggle and sweat to get to college . Damn it , does n't anybody go out and do what he wants to any more ? I 'm not saying you would n't make a good engineer , or that it would n't be fine for a change to have some engineers who care as muchp65about people as they do about gadgets . But supposing you find out after you get to college that you want to spend your time learning something useless  --  are you going to leave yourself open for it ? " " Boy , you sure are free with advice . " Joe looked at him gravely . His long sad jaw had the hint of a smile . " The men on the line like you , Walter . They do n't think you 're just nosy when you ask questions . They think you 're one of them , and in a good way you are . Maybe that 's why I 've got hopes for you . " Walter fought hard against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subversive outlook was so foreign to everything Walter had been taught ; but he was forced to admit to himself that more and more he was seeing the factory through Joe 's cold , discerning eyes , and he began to fear that if Joe were ever to leave , the plant would have no real existence other than as a money-producing nightmare . Not only was there no one else really to talk to about it , but Joe had forced Walter to try to formulate his emergingideas in an adult and comprehensible way . " The worst thing about the assembly line is what it does to your self-respect , " he said to Joe early one morning as they squatted on their haunches , waiting for the starting siren . " It 's hard to keep from feeling like a fool when you know that everybody looks down on what you 're doing , even the men who are doing it themselves . " Joe hung his hammer and metal spoon from the brass hook at his belt . " The big pitch has always been that we'rep66a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impractical European dreamers that production can serve people . But instead people are serving production . Look how frightened , how hysterical the bosses get when the line stops  --  they ca n't afford to figure what it costs you to keep it moving  --  they only know they 've got a production quota . Of course when sales resistance starts building up and they put the cork back in themselves , they give you just the opposite story . Who can blame the poor slob in the middle for suspecting that the whole setup is really as nutty as a fruitcake , and for feeling ashamed of himself for being caught up in it ? " " All right , " Walter challenged him . " Who 's crazy ? You , me , the guys around us , or the board of directors ? " " Anybody who gets suckered into believing that there 's anything real behind the billboards they put up to get the show on the road , so that he commits himself to buying the billboard pictures by selling his life on the installment plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole world is against him , that he 's the victim of a huge conspiracy organized to make his car fall apart before it 's been paid off . Does n't life in the factory seem to be deliberatelydesigned to lower your own self-esteem ? What happenswhen you 're knocking down a dent ? If you rap it too hard from the inside , you have to file it down that much more , and you hate yourself for it . If you do n't rap it hard enough , you only find out after it 's moved on down the line , and then you have to hurry up and wallop it again . In eitherp67case you hate yourself instead of hating the car , or the invisibleman that started up the line . " He laughed briefly in anticipation of what he was about to add . " It 's like the man that hits his thumb with a hammer while he 's hanging a picture  --  only here he keeps hitting his thumb because they 're moving the wall as fast as the union will let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball peen comes down on his nail ? Himself . " " I wonder , " Walter said slowly , " how many people actuallyfeel that way . " " More than you can count . It 's always safe to figure that if you feel something , the world must be full of people who feel the same way . Every sensible man realizes as he gets older that his feelings are n't unique . After all , that 's the basis of the best art  --  the fact that you recognize yourself in it , and all those inner experiences that you 'd thought no one else but you could know . " Walter was willing to recognize that he was not the only one to cringe when Buster called him back on a badly done job , to swear at himself for the mistakes that made him fall behind , to realize how he was being trapped into swearingat himself and deflecting his anger from what he did to the way he did it . But it was hard for him to believe that there were others who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads against the bars as he did , who dreamed of sunlightand freedom as he did , even though Joe tried to persuade him that the difference was often one of degree , or of his being able to express his feeling in a way that othersp68could n't . This was one of the questions that Walter was eager to argue with Joe , who moved from one extreme position to another , always mocking , always challenging him to learn what he stood for and to defend it like a man . " You know something , " Walter burst out impetuously one day , " I do n't know what I would have done here without you . " Instead of laughing or belittling this praise , Joe 's face darkened . The next morning he was not on the line . By the third day of his absence Walter was beginning to feel as though it had all been a dream , as though he were slipping once again into the awful pit of loneliness , exhaustion , and self-doubting despair . As a last resort he sought out the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's irresponsible , " said Pop . " He 's the kind of guy that just do n't care , " said the younger inspector . " No wife , no kids  --  no wonder he can take off three days without worrying about getting a reprimandor getting fired . " " He knows his work , " said Orrin grudgingly . " I do n't know where he learned it , but he did . Just the same , he takes off . You ca n't afford to take off like that nowadays , not if you want to hold down a job . " On the fourth day he came back . He told no one where he had been . " Am I glad to see you ! " Walter exclaimed  --  but Joe merely indicated , with a cold grin and a turn of his tattooed arm , that from time to time things came up that were more important than the making of automobiles.  |p69He  did not set to work , but almost immediately was engaged in serious talk with Buster the foreman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously , but suddenly Joe cut them off simply by lifting his hand . He said something very briefly , shoved his hands into his pockets , and the discussion was finished . To Walter 's amazement he came back to the line , picked up his toolbox , and nodded casually to him . " I just quit , Walter , " he said . " Going to hit the road . " " But  --  " " You 'll make out all right , no matter what you do . I do n't even have to wish you good luck . " Then he was off down the aisle , on his way to the tool crib and the plant police and the parking lot and God alone knew where after that , without so much as a handshake or an inclination of his lean frame . Suddenly Walter rememberedsomething : " Hey ! " he shouted . But Joe  --  if he heard him  --  did not turn around and soon was out of sight . You never told me about Pop , he wanted to tell Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask you  --  but even if Joe had not gone for good , Walter would not have known how to say to him all the things that should have been said , the words of gratitude and selfconfidence . When the relief man came a few minutes later to give him a twelve-minute break , he hurried to the bathroom . There , just beyond the big circular sink that could accom/modate half a dozen men , he could see out the tilted window to the vast parking lot . The dull winter light was gloomy and deceptive , and so vague was the air that the dark ranks of massed automobileswere no more than darker blurs against the background of the gray steel fencing and the lowering sky . One of the cars moved , or was it his imagination ? But no , the red taillight dimmed , glowed , dimmed . Joe , the vanishing American , was swinging out of the lot and away from the production line , out of Walter 's life and into someone else 's , out of the present and into what lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter , who now at last could wave his farewell , with his face pressed to the cool window as he watched the little light disappearing from view . Then he washed the sweat from his face and returned to his work.  |p71A  BOMBER bases and in baseball clubhouses , at firehousepinochle tables and in logging camps , in coal mines and among sand hogs , in the fo'c'sles of freighters and among the loading gangs at their piers , wherever Americanswork , play , or fight , always there is one man known as Pop . Married or single , young or old , expansive or taciturn , he will have been recognized as the senior member of the group , and from then on , regardless of his own will , his life will have acquired a new dimension , unsought and perhaps even unenjoyed . In the body shop of the auto assembly plant Pop was instantlyrecognizable , even from some distance , by his foamingshock of white hair , which tumbled over his forehead in a snowy cascade , and gave him a certain dignity even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd angle , its peak jutting out over one ear . This touch of dignity was vitally necessary , for Pop was cursed with a polysyllabic , unpronounceable last name , and stood only an inch or two more than five feet . Wizened and homely , with a cigar permanently suspended , not clenched but dangling , between his sallow lips , he tended to reinforcehis resemblance to a small monkey by hopping jaggedlyabout , grimacing furiously , and shouting unintelligiblecurses around his flopping , unlighted cigar . Pop had been working on the line as long as any of the foremen or supervisors in the body shop ; indeed , he had been Pop to them even when they were working on the line in the old plant in the old days , hanging on during the depression by clambering over the backs of weaker men ; and while they remained friendly with him as a fellowmember of their Old-timers ' Club and thus a sharer of secrets and memories , they could not encourage intimacy with him because of the very fact that he had never becomea boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck pond , in the pit , in the grinding booth , in the paint booth , on the jigs , even in the trim department  --  Pop had been deputizedto serve as collector for the weekly check pool . At first he had been uneasy with the responsibility , but once he had learned how to read the last five serial numbers on a pay check as a poker hand , he came to look forward to making the rounds during his relief break on payday , callingout to everyone from whom he had already collectedp73fifty cents , " T'ree eights is high so far . Anybody beat t'ree eights ? " With his cigar dangling before him like a dowsing rod as he hurried along expectantly in search of the lucky man , his snowy sheaf of hair did not float up and down in triumph only because the winner was going to tip him five or ten dollars for his trouble : Pop did not turn down the tip , but more important than the money was the knowledge that once a week he was the bearer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome from some lucky man whose full house or four of a kind would send him home with double pay in his pocket . Pop had even been approached to run for office in severalunion elections , to lend strength to a ticket composed of men who were not as well known in the plant as he . But he had refused , just as he would have turned down a companyoffer to be made a foreman , because he had a sense of his own limitations ; and this modesty , coupled with a native shrewdness that would not allow him simply to be used by those who were more educated than he , earned him popularity if it limited his future . For many years Pop had lived in a frame two-bedroom house with his wife and their only child ( two other children had died in infancy and there had been many miscarriages before the boy had been born and survived ) . He had bought the house in the very pit of the depression , paying the bank three thousand dollars for it in 1933 , partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lifetime at that price , and partly for the somewhat more mystical reason that he wanted to prove his immigrant 's faith in his country and his industry . Most of the three thousand dollars was mortgage , but Pop was not used to having debts on his back and he knew how to live cheaply . By the time the auto union had won the NLRB election , it was no longer necessary to have leek soup five times a week , and Pop methodically set aside his wage increases for the amortization of his mortgage . By the time his wife took mortally sick , he owned the house free and clear , and was able to start paying the hospital what he had been paying the bank . Pop and his wife had never gotten along . The reasons for this were various , and since no one would ever have dreamed of asking him about them  --  least of all his wife , who took his coldness with the bitter stoicism born of a thousand years of peasant suffering  --  they remained forever unexpressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not leave him unmoved , and as the malignancy swept through her system like a creeping rot , he sat by her side in their bedroom hour after hour , stroking the hand that he had left untouched these many years . Their son Rudy spent those evenings hunched over the kitchen table , doing his homework in algebra , Spanish , and chemistry ( subjects whose very names meant nothing to his parents ) , and in order that his mother 's groans might not distract him from his lessons Pop took to talking loudly ,  |p75sometimes  nonsensically but almost continuously , over his wife 's gasps of pain . " You know the inspector on the jigs , " he would say . " I told you about Willie , he was complaining to me today they made a nigger an inspector in his section . " Seeing his wife twitch on the pillow , gathering her waning strength to retch and groan , he reached for the pot and at the same time went on loudly , " I told him , Who are you to kick ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't want he should feed his family too ? ' So he said a hunky like me do n't understand nothing . " When the doctor lifted his hands despairingly , Pop took his advice and had the ambulance carry his wife , no longer stout and red-faced , to the hospital . After that he and Rudy took turns visiting her in the room where she lay dying with three other women . When Pop went to her , Rudy stayed home and did his schoolwork , then went down to the corner to hang around outside the candy store with his buddies until his father would hop off the trolley car , the cigar hanging limply from his bloodless lips , the cap wiltingon his white head . When Rudy went to his mother , takingalong a book to read toward the end when she no longer recognized him , Pop stayed home to do the dinner dishes and clean the house . As is so often the case , his wife was too long in dying , but at last she was gone and decently buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered eyes , thanks , and a handshake , was able to sigh with relief andp76not even to feel guilty at the sigh , for he knew that he had done everything that a husband should . Now at last , he felt , he was entitled to live without the rack of economic pressureor physical torment , and to enjoy his life with the one human being whom he adored  --  his son . The pay check which had been gobbled up first by the bank , then by the hospital , now went secretly into a small box for Rudy 's college education . There was , besides , the six , seven , sometimes ten dollars that came to him tax-free every week for running the check pool . He had once told Rudy , who was not particularly interested , about how he went around on payday collecting and then disbursing the fifty-cent pieces  --  but he had not explained that he acceptedmoney for what he did . Obscurely , he had wanted to keep at least one fact of his life secret from his son  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of his late wife , to reveal everything about his own private existence , but simply because he sensed the ultimate advantage in having an extra spigot to tap in case both hot and cold faucets should run dry . " Say , " the men on the line would kid him when they saw him paying off the happy winner and in turn pocketing the odd bills that were his due , " what you going to do with all that loot , Pop ? Why do n't you buy yourself some decent stogies for a change ? " He would merely smile mysteriously , gumming his unlightedcigar , and shoving back the grease-stained old cap to scratch his yellowing hair ; thus he betrayed his bewilder/ment at the effort to indulge in repartee and his genuine lack of knowledge of what he was going to do with that money . It was only gradually , as Rudy proceeded through high school during these happiest years of his father 's life , that Pop made the big decision as to how he was going to spend the check-pool money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , resting his white-stockinged feet on the hassock after work , with one eye on the television and the other on the front door through which Rudy was apt to come boundingin , not like the man who shared the house with him , but more like a well-trained young Airedale or retriever , his blond hair cropped short , his sweater with the big athletic letter unbuttoned part way down , a basketball or a football tucked under his arm , and a gigantic ice-cream cone clutched in his hand . Rudy was usually out evenings , with his gang down at the candy store or rarely with a girl ; it never occurred to him that he was leaving his father alone every night after supper , but then he was always back by ten-thirty , since he was used to keeping training hours . He was twice his father 's size , and as invincibly American as the heroes of the movies that Pop occasionally went to see . Pop knew very little about him or his dreams , if he had any , but he observedhim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sometimes he tiptoed in to watch the young athlete sleeping the sleep of the innocent and the youthful , flat on his well-muscled back with his naked armp78upflung and his mouth ajar just enough to permit the air to murmur through , and he thought himself the luckiest man in the world , to live quietly and at peace and even to share an occasional confidence with this beautiful boy . For Pop , worn by fulfilling the task of his generation , the making of countless thousands of automobiles  --  automobilesstretching from assembly line to highway to junkyard to steel mill back to assembly line  --  had finally yielded to the repeated suggestion that he exchange productionwork for inspection . In his bones he knew that he was tired , dog-weary of the endless hours of stooping and bangingand squatting and scraping and sweating , and he had portioned out to himself the remaining weary years of work until he should be eligible for retirement and Rudy should be on his own ; but if he had been offered an inspection job only because of all this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . The job was finally put to him as one calling not only for the irreplaceable kind of experience that was his , but for expert eyesight that would have to be physically checked in the plant hospital . Thus challenged , Pop submitted to the eye examination , passed , and was given a pile of soft cloths and a box of chalk to replace the polished tools he had worn smooth and shiny through so many years of constant use . He no longer had to sweat , but merely to squint at the jobs as they rolled by ; he no longer had to pound , but merely to indicate with a flick of the chalk between his rheumatic fingers the places that others were to pound . The years had taughtp79him where to look and where to feel with the tips of his fingers , and this work was so simply and pleasurably automaticthat he was free to think . So it was that he found himself turning over in his mind , not just in the evenings while he waited for Rudy , but during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to do with the money that was piling up every payday , the extra money that Rudy knew nothing about . Lookingaround him in the brilliant new factory ( he had been one of the old-timers who had survived the moving of the plant from its old location to its immense and magnificent new home ) , he was struck by the hundreds of strange young faces on the production line . They came and went in a continuous revolution , like boys running in and out of a schoolyard , so that the faces swam before his eyes ; except that here when these boys disappeared it was for good , and their replacements were sure to disappear also  --  and when the sweat ran down their flushed young faces it was for hard-earned money and not for fun . Many of these boys , especially the tall ones and those with athletic sweaters and crewcut hair , reminded Pop of his Rudy , who was already in his last year at high school and almost ready to be flung out into the world ; indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he came upon a big blond youngster bending over the water fountain or adjusting a pair of goggles over his eyes , with the irrational fear that here was-Rudy , dropped out of school or casting off larger ambitions as these boys hadp80done , in order to fill out the family income or have money for sharp clothes and nice girls or make the monthly carryingcharges on a new car . That was the point at which Pop got his idea . Looking back on it later , he could trace it to a fear that Rudy would betray him by being satisfied to become a grinder or a buffer or a welder or a metal finisher on the assembly line simply to gratify his immediate material desires , and to a hope that he could head this off by getting for Rudy a graduationpresent so splendid that it would serve many purposesat once : it would remind Rudy that his father loved him and would do anything for him , it would be a symbol of what you could buy with hard work , and it would by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudy to cut short his education or close out his future on the excuse that he wanted to earn money at once to buy himself an automobile . There were people who bought their sons automobiles for high school graduation presents . Pop did not know any such people , but he saw pictures of them in the magazines , so he knew that it could be done , even though it would seem wildly extravagant to his own neighbors and friends . Pop did n't give a damn about their opinion  --  in fact , he looked forward to making their eyes bulge . He went about the whole thing as methodically as he had gone about thep81buying of the house so many years before . " Rudy , I been looking at your report card , " he said one night when his son came slouching in the door , football inp81hand and a strawberry-colored bruise high on his right cheekbone . " What about it ? " " I looked hard , and it ai n't good enough . " " Aw , " his son said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sit down . " He even took the cigar out of his mouth and waved the wet end at his boy . " You think I 'm a greenhorn or something , all I got to do is sign it and forget about it ? It ai n't enough to pass nowadays . Just like it ai n't enough to have a high-school education . It used to be , but not any more . Nowadays all you can do with it is go to work on the assembly line . " " What 's wrong with that ? " Rudy asked boldly . " You 're doing it . " Pop glared at him . " Because I do n't know how to do nothing else . You got the head to do better , and I 'm willing to give you the chance . Now listen . I know you got to have top marks to get into college . You can still do it . You bring home an eighty-five average in June and I 'll give you the biggest God damn graduation present of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished , and he was panting with excitement . It was a long time since he had spoken to Rudy like this , and he could feel the blood in his face . What was more , his son 's eyes were glittering , sparkling like butterflies , so brightly that it almost hurt him to look into them . " What is it , Pop ? You got something special in mind ? "  | " You 're damn right . But you 'll never find out what it is if you do n't do your part . Bring in the marks , and I 'll bring in the present . Is it a deal ? " Pop knew it was a deal before he asked . He was so confidentthat Rudy would strain every nerve to make the requiredgrades that he went ahead at the plant and made preparations for selecting a really good car . First he sought out his friend Louis , an inspector on the final line who checked brakes and shocks . " Louis , " he said to him as they sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to graduate high school in June . " Louis turned toward him his Roman gladiator 's brokennosedface and dug his fingers into his curly gray hair . " I 'd swear it was yesterday , the union picnic when Rudy won the sack race for ten-year-olds . " " I want to get a present for the boy . " Mildly interested , Louis sipped his coffee in silence . " I want to buy him a new car , right off the line . " " Christ ! " his friend spluttered , staring at him in dismay . " Have you gone nuts ? " " I got my reasons . " He added quietly , " He 's a good boy , he deserves it . " " But a car . My God , you never bought yourself a new car . Not once , in all these years . Is this one at least going to be for you too ? " Pop shook his head . " Just for the boy . If he goes to college , he takes it with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new car ? A convertible ? To me it 's nothing , I 'm an old man , I can drive an old heap , it 's all the same to me . So do n't argue with me , Louis . I just want to ask you , if I tag a good convertible , one that I know has good fit all over , a good deck-lid fit , doors that close right , will you watch it for me when it comes down the line ? See that it do n't leak , that the brakes are tight  --  you know , every-thing . " " Of course I will . But  --  " " I 'm going to ask Colletti , the foreman over in paint , to keep an eye on it for me . He 'll make a mark right next to mine on the tag , and you 'll know it 's okay when it reaches you . " " All right , sure . If you 're going to buy , you 're going to buy . How are you going to finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took out his cigar and said , " I do n't believe in that financing crap . Maybe I 'm old-fashion , but I do n't want to pay four hundred bucks extra for the privilege of owning the car . I saved up for it , Louis . I saved up for it for a long time , and I 'm going to pay cash . " He put his coffee cup down , pleased at the expression on Louis 's face , arose , and headed for his work . Once he had made his decision , Pop was serene . On the job he retained his payday prerogative of collecting and payingoff for the check pool . It meant that he could peer into all the new faces , thrusting his cigar into the uneasy smiles of the probationary men and asking them if they wanted to play the pool while he sized them up , shaking his whitep84mop of hair dubiously at the types of men that were turning up nowadays in the factory . These men were native-born , all of them , except for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even these few were so eager to strike roots that they took on the color of their fellows as quickly as possible , not at all glad even for a brief chat in their native tongue with Pop . " It 's a different kind of guy you see coming in here , " he remarked philosophically to Orrin , who had himself been working on the line as a metal finisher for less than a year and who nodded as he lit a cigarette off the blue flame of a solder gun and bent to his rugged work . " When I first started , you would n't see all American-born like you do now . They was from all over the four corners of the world . And I 'll tell you something more . Those foreigners like me worked harder in them days , not just because there was no union protection and you had speed-up , speed-up all day , but because they figured they had a good job and they wanted to hang on to it and make something out of themselves . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what they 're like . They figure it 's a crumb job , they say it 's like the army , and they wo n't stick it out here a minute longer than they have to . The attitude 's different , you know what I mean , kid ? " Orrin spat out loose tobacco and smoke in an angry gesture . The sweat stood out on his balding forehead under his blue-striped railroad cap as he strained to reach a dent high on the hip of his car 's quarter-panel . He was ap85stern-faced man of thirty-five whom you might have taken for a preacher if you had first met him in a dark suit instead of in his . blue coveralls , which bore his name embroideredin yellow over the breast pocket and across his back the words , in large block yellow characters : He straightened up from his work with a grunt . " Damn right I know what you mean . Nobody wants to give a day 's work for a day 's pay any more . The more you goof off , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't brought up like that . I was brought up to work . " Mildly Pop objected , " You 're not the only one . Maybe my boy do n't work like I did when I was his age , but should he have to ? Besides , I taught him you do n't get no place without work . No , what I mean is him and his friends , all the young fellows , they look down on work like this here . They do n't want to get their hands dirty , they do n't want to raise up a sweat , and if they have to they kick like hell about it . " Orrin glanced at him shrewdly . He knew that Pop had picked him to unburden himself to not just because they happened to be standing next to one another , but because Pop knew him to be one of the few who took his work seriously . " I do n't see you bringing your son in here for a job . "  | " God forbid ! " Pop cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this  --  " but then he stopped , struck suddenly dumb by the contradiction into which he had been lured . Jamming the dead cigar between his lips , he caressed the next job on the line with his cloth-covered hand and began to chalk it up , casting a final stealthy look at Orrin . The metal finisher wore a nasty look of triumph about his thin lips , pursed for the job which he was surveying . There was something unpleasant about the man , something that made you regret the impulse that led you to speak to him in the first place : when you thought about it , he looked not so much like a preacher as like a mortician , an undertaker who gloated over each customer not as a matter of business , but because he was still alive , while his client , having lost the battle , was very much dead . Orrin could not resist a parting jibe . " Take the kid there , " he said , nodding at a young metal finisher who was striving furiously , crouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punch out a dent , sweat streamingdown his forehead and his lips moving silently  --  praying , or maybe cursing . " Walter 's willing , but he does n't seem to know the first thing about metal finishing , or about doing any kind of hard work . He does n't know how to pace himself , he does n't know when to quit and move on to another job . So he 's knocking himself out like a punching bag  --  he 'll be half dead by the time he gets out of this plant . Just the same you 've got to give him credit for thep87old college try . I hear he 's saving up to go away to school , did you know that ? " He added maliciously , " It is n't every boy you see doing that nowadays . " Relaxing at home with his feet up before the television and his day-long cigar actually lighted , Pop tried to put Orrin 's digs out of his mind . When you came down to it , Orrin and Louis and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous . It was a human thing , and there were very few people who could rise above it . Rudy was staying at home more . He was getting down to the finish line and he could n't hide the fact that he was scared . He studied hard , lugging home extra books and holding long telephone conversations with studious classmateswhom he had previously scorned . His long , powerful legs sprawled before him and the telephone cocked into his shoulder , he wrote hastily as he listened , nodding , uh-huhing , and filling his notebooks . Would he have been able to go into the plant and sweat it out for a year or two in order to earn his own college education like Walter ? Not his own car  --  any damn fool kid could do that , sticking at it till he 'd made the payments and then waking up to realize that there was no other way for him to make a living  --  but his own college education ? There was no way of knowing short of forcing him into it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes swollen with pride and adoration , had no intention of doing . One day it was all over . Pop came out of the plant withp88his lunch box and the morning paper under his arm and was astonished to see Rudy waiting for him at the gate , chatting with a plant policeman . The boy looked like a movie hero , already a little tan , standing there in his shortsleevedsport shirt , more powerful and taller than the cop . " I made it , Pop , " he cried happily . " With room to spare . I got an eighty-seven-point-two average ! " " I figured you would , " Pop said calmly . " I figured you 'd come through when the pressure was on . " He wished that some of his fellow workers would come out , so that he could introduce them to Rudy , but the boy had a quick stride , and Pop had to hurry along to keep up with him . " Take a look at that new convertible by the gate , " he remarked casually to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? " " Man , " Rudy sighed . " Who would n't ? " " Well , you will . I got one all picked out for you . A beauty . You earned it , kid . " Rudy started to stammer . He turned very red . " But  --  but  --  you 're kidding ! " " You 'll get it in time for graduation . Did n't I promise you something extra special if you made that eighty-five ? I ordered it in two tones of blue , your favorite color . " His son was actually trembling , and his eyes were filled with tears of gratitude . " Honest , " he said , " I do n't know what to say . " " Just say that you 'll drive careful and that you 'll try to make something of yourself , like you already started to this year . "  |p89On  the night of the graduation exercises Rudy and his father sat up late , drinking beer on the front porch . The new car , in which they had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curb , dappled in moonlight . After the second can of beer Pop reminisced , as though it had all happened ages ago , " Sure got a kick out of seeing you on that stage , especially when the principal give you the diploma and said you was President of the High Y and all that . " " That was just because I was good in sports , " Rudy replieduncomfortably . Then he started to laugh . " You know something , I have n't seen you so dressed up since Ma 's funeral . " " Yes . . . yes . . . I guess that 's right . " Pop nodded slowly . " She should have been there tonight . . . . Well , look at the time . I still got to get up in the morning and go to work . " Rudy shuffled his feet . " Say , as long as you 're going to bed , you would n't mind if I went out for a while , would you ? I thought I 'd drive down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole mob there celebrating . " Pop arose and put his hand on his son 's shoulder . " Go ahead , have a good time . No more football or basketball , you do n't have to go to bed early any more , hey ? " " That 's right , Pop . " After that Pop hardly ever saw his son . Without the need to be in by ten-thirty , he used to creep back in the dead of night . Sometimes the old hand alarm , which Popp90used to weight down his trousers with as they hung from the bureau , read three o'clock , sometimes even later as Rudy tiptoed into the bathroom to undress . When Pop arose and went off to work , he could hear his son breathing heavily and rhythmically behind his closed door . I 'll give him a couple weeks to get it out of his system , Pop thought . No use nagging him about it when the car is still so new . But the scene for which he was half-consciously bracing himselfnever came . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinochle with three friends from the plant , and then stayed up to watch the late show on television . He was hopeful that it would knock him out so that he would not lie tensely waiting for the sound of Rudy pulling up to the curb . But even after an extra can of beer he had trouble falling asleep , and when at length he did drop off , towards two-thirty , he slept hard , dreaming of the murders he 'd seen and the cards he 'd misplayed . Less than an hour later he was awakened by the shrill peal of the front doorbell . It sounded like someone screaming , a woman screaming , he thought dazedly as he sat uprightin bed , the collar of his nightshirt clinging clammily to his neck . Rudy must have forgotten his key , he thought as he struggled to consciousness ; but even as he padded barefoot down the stairs , without stopping to look for a bathrobe , he realized that that was impossible , since Rudy had put his house key proudly on the new golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked out at the tall policeman bulking before him , his frame outlined by the rays of the street lamp . The policeman held something cupped in his hand that looked like a driver 's license , or an identification card from a wallet . " Casimir Sczystafkiewicz ? Sorry I ca n't pronounce it any better . " The policeman bent towards him apologetically , protectively . " That sounds like me . What 's the matter ? " " There 's been an accident . Rudolph  --  " " Where is he ? " " Sisters of Charity Hospital . " The policeman waited in the parlor in absolute silence while Pop dressed , then held the front door open for him solicitously and slammed it to after checking to make sure that Pop had his keys on him , and led him to the squad car at the curb . As soon as Pop entered the hospital , which was as familiarto him as a second home , although he had simply pushed it out of his mind in the years since his wife 's death , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dead on arrival , he was informed bluntly . There had been a girl in the car with him who had been thrown clear ( he had been pinned behind the wheel when he rammed a concrete abutment at fifty miles an hour ) and who was now bleeding internally . No prediction could be made about her chances to her parents , whom he had passed crying furiously in the otherwise empty waiting room.  |p92Po|p  looked down wonderingly at his son , sheeted to the chin . Only a small bruise , like the old football souvenirs , outlined the closed right eye . He felt everything toppling within him , finally and forever . He touched the boy 's crisp hair , still damp with the sweat of shock , and turned away toward the door , unable to control the noises that welled up in his throat as though he were being strangled . " You got somebody to keep you company ? " The policemanheld him by the elbow . " No . Nobody . That 's all right , " he said , freeing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want me to take you back home ? " " I guess so . " Pop looked up at him vaguely . " Listen , where 's the car ? " " At the scene of the accident . They 're taking pictures and drawing sketches , but it 'll have to be towed away soon , before traffic starts to build up . We 'll notify you about it . " " Can you let me see it ? " The policeman glanced at him queerly . " Sure , it 's on the way back . " When they arrived at the scene of the accident , a tow truck was already backed up to the rear end of Rudy 's car , and the driver was attaching a tow chain to the spotless chrome bumper . Sand had been scattered over the stains of spilled blood and oil on the asphalt street , but the abutment was broken and would be until it was rebuilt , and the automobilewas smashed beyond rebuilding . The steeringp93wheel , on which his son had been impaled , was straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car . " How . . . " Pop hesitated . " Do you know how it hap-pened ? " " They were drinking . Not drunk , " the policeman added hastily as he started up the squad car , " but drinking . Seems like he was blinded by approaching lights  --  he was going too fast anyway  --  and he got rattled and twisted the wheel too hard . " The policeman waited at the curb until Pop had entered his house and turned on the lights ; then he drove off into the night . Standing at the window behind the porch , Pop watched him disappear . Then he sat down and waited for the dawn . When the sky was blue enough for him to turn off the lights , he telephoned his parish priest , who was preparing for early Mass . Then he went into the kitchen to heat the pot of coffee that he had left on the stove for his son , and , automatically drinking the scalding brew as he stood at the stove , he waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . The next day was Monday . He arose at a quarter to six and made two sandwiches and a Thermos of coffee for his lunch , and left for work . He did not go into the cafeteria , where his friends would be gathered over coffee , but went directly from the locker room and the time clock to the pro/duction line itself , deserted except for Buster the foreman , who stood at his desk making out his attendance sheets . His mouth opened when he saw Pop . " For God 's sake , " he said , his voice unnaturally loud in the quiet shop , with the line and the machinery not yet running , " what are you doing here ? " Pop put a fresh cigar in his mouth . " You heard about it ? " " Louis called up your boss , Halstein , yesterday , and Halstein called me . Christ , Pop , I do n't know how to tell you how I feel . " " Yeah , yeah , " Pop muttered . " Say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing to the aisle down which the inspection department foremanwas hastening , his bald head gleaming under the fluorescents , his swinging forearms below the turned-back cuffs of his white shirt thick with coarse black hair . " Hello , Halstein , " Pop said around his cigar . Halstein stuck out his hairy hand . " My condolences , Pop . My wife 's too . We were shocked when Louis phoned us yesterday . I never expected to see you here this morning , I was going to come up and see you after work . " " Listen , they got him laid out , Rudy , in the funeral parlor . I ca n't hang around there , I ca n't hang around the house . I figured the best place for me is here . " " Well , sure , " Halstein said , " but the funeral and everything  --  " " They 're going to bury him tomorrow morning . I thought I 'd take the whole day off , if it 's all right with you . "  | " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off if you want . " " No . . . no . . . that 's not for me . I got to have something to do . Besides , that would have to count as my vacationtime , and I know you got the vacation schedule all set up , and it would throw you off if you had an extra man out . " " Matter of fact , " Halstein said uneasily , " I would n't be able to get away myself for the funeral tomorrow . But I thought Mae and I would stop around tomorrow night . " All that week the men did come to see him , the older men , those he had worked with in the plant for years and years . Some came with their wives , bringing home-baked cakes and cellophane-wrapped baskets of fruit ; and everybody in the department , including the newcomers , had chipped in to send a handsome wreath for Rudy 's coffin . It helped to take the curse off the first week . But after that of course they would stop coming , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drank beer . And Pop would have time on his hands , time in which to think , and to go over and over again what he had done to Rudy with the money he had saved for him . At the end of the week , on payday , one of the younger metal finishers on the line approached Pop , who was staring off into space with the brown cloth dangling from his hand and the cigar dangling from his lips , and said diffidently , " Say , Pop , are you going to make the rounds for the check pool today ? " Pop looked at him and shook his head curtly . " I beenp96doing it long enough . It ai n't worth the trouble to me any more . You want a check pool , get somebody else to run around . " The boy backed off , hurt written on his face , and Pop was surprised to feel , instead of shame , a stab of pleasure at the boy 's discomfiture , the first pleasure he had experienced in a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . He slept little , and he went about his work as mechanically as if he were a part of the moving assembly line itself . He had never consciously blamed his wife for not having filled his house with children , as he had been entitled to expect that she would  --  he had simply stopped caring about her . Now he found that he was caring less and less about himself ; he was shaving only when he caught sight of his face in the mirror , changing his socks and underwear only when he bathed , even eating less and not bothering to put away halffinishedcans of salmon and torn packages of sliced bread . But he could not bring himself to believe , turn it about in his mind as he would , that he was to blame for Rudy 's death . If he had not made Rudy work and study so hard for the present , maybe he would n't have stayed out late every night after graduation . But that was pointless : Rudy could have gotten killed in the car without staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything else but two hundred and twenty-five horsepower worth of destruction , maybe Rudy would n't have held a fatal steering wheel in hisp97hands . But that was pointless too : Rudy was the kind to go out and buy his own car , and get killed in it too , probably . If he had brought Rudy up differently  --  not to drink , not to drive too fast  --  maybe he would still be alive and preparing for college . But that was even more pointless : a man who worked hard all day did n't deliberately go out and teach his son wrong things ; if Rudy learned wrong , he had learned wrong from his friends , from the movies , not from his father . Once he had absolved himself of direct guilt , however , there remained the question of whether he had had the right to buy Rudy the car at all . Did a man have the right to buy his son a hunting rifle ? Nobody said no , but all sorts of questions could be raised as to what kind of boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would shoot himself with the gun . It kept coming back to the question of what kind of boy Rudy had been , and there grew within Pop the terrible feeling ( all the more terrible because it made him feel rottenfor harboring it ) that Rudy had been an unworthy son  --  unworthy of the automobile , unworthy of his father 's love and trust and admiration , unworthy of the innocent girl whom he had crippled . Worthy , in fact , only of squanderinghis father 's life savings as a college bum , only of being representative of his generation , of the careless and wise-talking young men whom Pop saw about him every day . He realized that he had no patience with the boys whop98worked on his assembly line , but he had no desire to curb his impatience . Young Walter in particular , with his shortcuthair and his stubby nose , a kind of poor , sawed-off imitation of Rudy , got on his nerves with his sweat and his lousy , miserable work and his burning ambition to save money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his file at a hump way down on the rocker panel of his job , a hump that it was n't even his business to file down , and succeeded only in tipping over a paper cup underneath the line in which Pop kept soaking several sticks of chalk to keep them smooth and workable . " Ca n't you watch where you 're pushing that file ? " Pop demanded , taking the cup and chalk from Walter 's clumsy gloved hand . " I 'm sorry , I 'm did n't mean to  --  " " Sorry  --  all you guys are sorry after you 've made a mess of it . It 's a wonder they pull any production here at all with the kind of kids they hire to do a man 's job . " Miserable and furious , the boy turned away . But there were others to annoy Pop , and after a time he began to suspectthat they were deliberately ganging up on him , not just erasing his chalk marks  --  as anybody would do if he could get away with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't looking , pushing his toolbox around so he could n't find it , even tattling to his relief man that he was complaining about being gypped out of his time . He was sure that they were whispering about him and nudgingp99each other when he showed up , that they called him a crab and a sourpuss and worse . " Why do n't you lay off Walter and the other kids , Pop ? " Orrin demanded one day . " What good does it do you , pickingon them ? " " They 're picking on me , " Pop replied shortly , knowing even as he said it that he sounded petulant and childish . The fact was that he was getting frightened . Retirement , which he had always thought of as something to look forward to , now loomed before him in all its majestic lonelinesslike an alp before a weary mountain climber . He would be sitting on his porch with the morning paper and nothing ahead of him for the whole day , while all these young stinkers would be working on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the future and coming home to something every night . There was a lot , he realized , in what Orrin said , especially when it came from the one man on the line who held himself superior because he knew how to work harder than the youngsters . In the two and a half years that Pop had left on the line he ought to be able to wind up friends with the kids , to have them punching him on the back instead of tripping him up . It 's what comes from living alone , he thought , you get a little nuts ; and he determined to find company to share the house in which he was going to spend his retirement . But it could not be a grownup , not a man or a woman whose chatter he would have to listen to night in and nightp100out ; and a child was out of the question . For a while he toyed with the idea of buying some dwarf fruit trees and planting them in the little grass strip between his house and that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even his wife 's tiger-lily border at the side of the house , that she had planted just before her final illness , annoyed him as he brushed past it , perhaps because it reminded him of her , and he knew beforehand that he would sooner sit dreaming in front of the television than be bothered with pruning , spraying , and watering . Finally he stopped in at a pet shop on his way home from work one night and bought himself a mutt . He did not want a full-grown beast that was set in its ways , that would not respond to a name he would select for it , that would roll over and die of old age just when he needed its companionship in the long days of his retirement . He picked a small dog that was friendly and that had room to grow . At first he kept the pup locked in the house , but he found that when he returned from work it had ignored the papers he spread on the kitchen floor next to the stove . So he chained it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it half choked itself by running around in circles and they had to climb in and unwind it . At last Pop hit on the solution . He bought double-thickness aluminum screening and set to work screening in the left side of his porch . He found that he was starting to talk to the dog asp101though it were human and could reply , and for a while he was embarrassed  --  suppose somebody should hear ?  --  but after a time he grew indifferent : he had been talking to himself for so long that it seemed only natural to talk to the dog . " Building you a nice home , pup , " he would grunt as he hammered the frame into place for the screening . " Lots of fresh air , fresh water , you can crap in the corner . Okay ? " The dog was friendly , and grateful for small favors . When the porch was done , it moved in as though it had al-. ways belonged there . Peering at him through shaggy black brows remarkably like Pop 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anticipate his desires . " You know what I 'm going to call you from now on ? " Pop demanded , as he picked up his lunch box and prepared to leave for work . " I 'm going to call you Rudy , in memory of a nice boy . He went away and left me all alone , but now I 've got you , have n't I ? Down , Rudy , down ! Now be good and do n't try to tear the screening  --  if you 're real good and do your business on the paper like you 're supposed to , I 'll bring you home a surprise tonight . " Amazingly , the dog leaped up and began to lick Pop 's hands . " Say , you are a smart one , are n't you ? You want to know what the surprise is , do n't you ? Well , I ca n't tell you , or it wo n't be a surprise . But if you 're good and do like Pop says , you 'll get something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his newly made porch door firmlyp102and backed down the walk , his eyes fixed on his dog , which had clambered up on an old chair and was panting and woofing gently against the aluminum screening . " Got you where I want you now , Rudy . You wo n't break loose from there , you 'll be waiting when I come home . And do n't forget , if you do like I say there 's going to be a juicy present for you . . . " He walked backwards all the way to the corner , thinking of the nourishing and safe soupbone that he was going to pick up from the butcher on the way home , and then , satisfiedthat the dog was still sitting obediently where he had left it , he turned and shuffled off through the brilliant , blindingstreets . At the intersection he put a fresh cigar between his lips , and , as the morning sun struck him full and blazed on his white hair defiantly foaming forth from under the wrinkled cap , he pulled back his shoulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working on the line for about ayear , his right hand began to stiffen . Instead of letting up , he tightened his grip on his tools and set to work even harder than before . Orrin was a stubborn man ; he knew that he had been called a fanatic , and he took a certain pride in the knowledge . Once , at the height of the auto production season , the men in the body shop were asked if they would come in not only on Saturday , but on Sunday also in order to meet the quota . Although they were entitled to double time for Sunday work , most of them were satisfied with the fifty hours ' pay they had already earned , and one of the welders protested bitterly to Orrin . " Now they want you to work on Sundays , for Christ 's sakes . You do n't even get to see your family . Are youp104going to come in , or are you going to tell them you have to go to church ? " Orrin held out his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied coldly , " I never go to church . Work is my religion . " When he saw the look on the welder 's face , Orrin wished that he could have taken back the prideful , boasting words . But it was too late , and he knew that it would get around the shop , what he had said and the way he had acted , and it would be added to the already uncomplimentary picture most of the men had of him . Orrin would have preferred to be liked , but he really did n't care . The men on the line came and went . What the transients thought of him made absolutely no difference . As for the others , the few who like himself made up the permanentbackbone of the body shop , they had learned to take him as he was . At first , when they observed the concentrated fury with which he worked , they muttered , " Company man , " and one or two even approached the shop committeeman to find out if the union could get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orrin did not work the way he did because he wanted to impress the bosses or because he was a brownnoseby nature ; although he had never belonged to a union before , he was perfectly willing to go along with everyone else on the line , even with their work standards  --  he was simply used to working hard and steady , and he took hisp105pleasure from the plain fact that he could work better and harder and longer than anybody else around him . Or so everyone came to understand . While he was not openly sneered at , Orrin knew as the months passed that he was not going to be liked here in the auto plant any more than he had been in the army or in any of the jobs he had held in the years between the end of the Second World War and his coming to work here . He made some casual friends , he earned respect for his severity and his skill and his fortitude , and finally he achieved a kind of neutral balanceon the line . This was enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or better but who could not keep up with him ; it had been so when he was nineteen and number-one man in his infantry outfit , and it was so now when he was losing his hair but was still number-one man on this line . When he listened to the big young fellows around him whining about how hard their work was , he could not keep the contempt he felt from showing in his face . In a way it was paradoxical that he , as the one man who really enjoyed pressure , the one man who never complainedwhen the cars moved so fast that they seemed to be rolling on their own fiendish motorless power or so close together that you could hardly squeeze between them to do your job , should have been the one who smiled the least . Those who bitched and those who griped often found occasion to laugh . They pulled practical jokes on each other like children , cutting off the gas to the solder flower 's line , cut/ting off the air to the metal finishers ' grinding discs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like bowling balls down the aisles to bang one another in the shins ; but not Orrin . He took his pleasure without showing it , he knew that they must envy him for being able to enjoy what he did without horsing around , and he smiled almost as seldom as he laughed . As a result Orrin , whose face was long and rather pinched anyway , with two unhumorous vertical lines framinghis thin hyphen of a mouth like parentheses , always looked sobersided . He wore a blue-striped railroad man 's cap , in which his wife had taken a tuck , to protect his narrowbalding head from dust , and baggy coveralls ( still advertisingLAKESIDE SERVICE STATION &; REST. , although noone but Orrin knew where it was ) which hinted at an undertaker 's figure , sad and lean but paunchy . When he changed in the locker room from the coveralls to the dark , conservative suit and tie he invariably wore to and from work , he looked even more like a mortician . Behind his back  --  he had heard it once  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inside he burned . He burned with the fire of youth , and he felt that those around him were no more men than the gutless boys who had come and gone , wounded , weary , or fleeing before the enemy in the French forest where he had fought for one hundred and seven days , senior man in his outfit at the age of nineteen . They groaned about coming in to work at all ; they spat with dis/gust as the siren blew and they had to pick up their tools : it was all too much like the men in his company who had behaved as though Hitler was personally picking on them , when they would have preferred to stay home and let the enemy do as he pleased . For himself , Orrin faced each day with the conviction that he was setting an endurance record , not unlike the one he had set in France . After he had been invalided out of the line against his will , he was awarded an official commendation ; at the bottom of his heart he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would one day be recognized too . He had always admired , ever since childhood , the flagpole-sittersand marathon-dancers , the frozen explorers and solo fliers  --  all those who were able to clench their teeth and carry on indefinitely . His wife had even teased him about it early in their marriage when she learned how Orrin as a schoolboy had studied the box scores faithfully and tensely every day of Joe DiMaggio 's marvelous consecutive-gamehitting streak . " I think you cared more about that hitting streak than you did about your own family , " Edith had laughed , but then had quickly stopped when she saw his face . " You do n't understand , " he had said , as calmly as possible . " Most women would n't . It 's what makes a man unusual , doing something nobody else can do . It 's why I was the last guy to stick it out on the line . They had to carry me back on a stretcher , did you know that ? " But then it was his turn to stop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , knew so well that even though she would never understand , she was bored by the most important thing he 'd ever done . Orrin was driven to try to explain what it had been like , on the line , to men in the factory who cared no more about it than Edith . His fellow veterans cherished reminiscences of Calvados and cognac , of sudden dark encounters and complaisantgirls , and they resented being reminded of the unpleasantthings , which a lot of them had n't even lived through anyway , but had only read about in the comfort of their heated barracks . " Is that all you think about ? " demanded Harold the pick-up man , one lunch hour as they were sitting in a semicircleon the floor , eating sandwiches . Aside from an annoyinghabit of handing out gratuitous advice , Harold was one of the more popular of the older men . He swallowed a small cookie , his large , pointed Adam 's apple working up and down like a bobbin as he masticated , and then said : " In point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was already married when I went off to the army . But that 's past history , Orrin . People do n't want to hear about it any more . " Stung bitterly , Orrin shot back , " Sure , you probably ca n't even remember getting hit . You were probably in a drunken fog . " There was an awful silence . Most of them knew that Harold was a drunkard  --  he had volunteered the informationhimself in a detached , almost scientific way  --  but forp109that very reason no one before had ever dared to mention it aloud . Harold said coolly , " As a matter of fact , I was cold sober when I earned my Purple Heart . I got sprayed in the ass on Guadalcanal , bending over to pick up a booby-trapped bottle of Jap beer . " When the laughter had subsided he added , " But I 'm going to be forty years old come my next birthday , and I 've got more to think about than that stuff that nicked me way the hell and gone back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently out of high school , who did n't know what war was like and did n't know what work was like . At that only one of them , the kid named Walter who was saving up to go away to college , seemed willing to make the effort to understand . He was clumsy and slow to catch on , but he had a way of gritting his teeth that made Orrin suspect that he would stick no matter how miserable Buster made it for him . What 's more , he would stick the way Orrin would have stuck if he 'd found it hard : not because he had been starving , or his mother needed money for an operation , but simply as a point of honor . So Orrin said to him , " Very few people take anything seriously but their own little pleasures . But it 's the few that count . They 're the ones that win the wars and keep productiongoing . " " Yes , but in a democratic country you have to count on the majority , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , sweating freckled face against the already wet sleeve of his khaki shirt . " If we dropped dead tonight , the factoryp110would open just the same tomorrow morning , and they 'd turn out just as many cars . " Orrin shook his head . " There 's always what they call key men . I do n't care where it is , if those key men do n't hold their end . . . things will fold . Take me . I 'm no superman , far from it , but at least I know how to hold on . I 'm not saying I won the war singlehanded or any of that boloney , but we would have been a lot worse off in my sector if I had n't made up my mind I was going to stick it out on the line until they ordered me back or I got hit . And that 's what happened . Guys came and went , they got hit , they went batty , they took off like rats , they faked everything from trench foot to clap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the longer I held out the more it bucked up the rest of the guys , and that 's why I got my commendationafter they took the shrapnel out of my legs . " " Those must have been the greatest days of your life , " Walter said innocently . " Well , they were , " Orrin replied sharply . He pulled on his gloves and prepared to go back to work . " I do n't mind lookingback on them  --  why should I ? I do n't forget all the mud and slop and blood , or the stinking K rations and C rations , or shaving out of my helmet with cold water . That was part of the whole show . If there 's no obstacles , there 's no glory , right ? " Walter scuffed his feet through the debris before them , remains of sandwich wrappings , paper bags , cigarette packages , metal filings , stumps of lead . He seemed to be con/sidering an answer . Finally he said , " I guess your life has n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much . " Orrin felt his face getting red . Nervously he yanked off his cap , then jammed it back low on his forehead , so low that it almost covered his eyes . " It 's different , " he said . " When you 're married and raise a family it 's different . " " How many kids you got , Orrin ? " " Three . All girls . " He took up his file and said aggressively , " Besides , that 's what I like about this place . Never mind the money , aside from the fact that the rate is betterhere than you can get anyplace else . It 's a challenge . It 's not for sissies and it 's not for old ladies . There 's always obstacles , they keep the pressure on you all day from the time you punch in , the line keeps going like the tides or the earth turning , and it 's up to you to keep up . Once you 're on the line , it 's up to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy 's question about the rest of his life was like a ladle stuck into a simmering stew  --  it set Orrin to thinkingall over again . He was not happy at home . He could n't put his finger on it ; all he knew was that he looked forward to going to work more than he did to going home . He had come home from overseas in ' 45 to the farm town where he had grown up . Everybody on Main Street had given him a big hello , and he had been invited to talk at a chicken dinner given for the GI 's . Halting but not shy , he had spoken frankly of those climactic three months of the war when he ' had stuck it out on the line . His attitude hadp112been so unusual that Mr. Haskins , who owned the feed and grain store , asked him about it . " Tell me something , Orrin , " he had said . " You 're the only boy I know that 's come back with a good word for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's come you did n't re-enlist ? " " No sense being in the army if there 's no fighting going on , Mr. Haskins , " Orrin had replied . " Besides , I 've got a girl . I doubt if I could talk her into marrying a soldier . " Edith was the kid sister of his high-school buddy . Soon after her brother was discharged he had become a television repairman and started to put on weight . He turned out to be a fanny-pincher , the kind of man who was forever bragging about the hot reception he got from the lonely housewives whose antennas he mounted . But Edith was not at all like her brother . What attracted Orrin to her most of all was her intensity . She was a slim , tallish girl , almost lean , bold-eyed , with ropelike veins in her forearms that protruded even more when she knotted her fingers together in moments of excitement . Although she was not conventionally attractive , Orrin was desperate to make love to her , perhaps because he could sense intuitively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the kind to hold him at bay : he had her two or three times in his dad 's barn , and once even on her parents ' bed , and the more he took her the more anxious he was to marry her quickly and keep her as his own . Soon after the wedding they moved into a Quonset hutp113on the edge of the state college campus and Orrin enrolled in ag school under the GI Bill . Their days were dull and cramped ; their nights were agonizingly wonderful . Clamped together on the studio couch under the arching metal roof , they grappled back and forth over tearing sheets , groaning and crying out in ecstasy , the floor around them a tangle of blankets , textbooks , and underclothing . Before the year was out Edith was pregnant . She wanted above everything , even above success for Orrin , a healthy baby , and she decided that they would have to play it safe . What was more , Orrin 's father had been failing on the farm ; a fatal disease had wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had finally gone to work as a machinist in a soft-drink bottling plant . Within two years he was forced to sell out the farm Orrin had been counting on , and Edith became pregnant again , unexpectedly . " There 's no sense our sticking around here , " Orrin said to her one evening after she had put their daughter to sleep in her crib . " We 've got no farm to go to . If we have to start from scratch , it might as well be in something with a future . I 'm not going to be a farmer , Edie  --  it 's a dying game . Let 's pull out . " She sat on the edge of the mattress , winded from having pulled the studio couch apart and made up the bed . Her shoulders sagged ; below her sunken chest her belly jutted out like a great globe ; her thickly veined hands lay limply across her widespread knees . She grinned up at him , a ciga/rette dangling from one corner of her mouth . " Better to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her parents ' house , into the attic bedroom . Their second daughter was born , and Orrin took a temporary job as a driver for the soft-drink firm where his father worked . The hours were long and the pay was ridiculous ; Orrin was relieved when Edith herself suggested that he get the hell out of there and look for a decent job . After a while  --  too long for his own comfort , with his father-in-law watching him out of the corner of his eye  --  Orrin caught on as a roofer 's helper . This too paid next to nothing , but at least the government matched his earnings with on-the-job trainee checks . And there was a possibility that in time he might get set up on his own . But the babies , noisier than little girls are supposed to be , were growing fast , and it was becoming impossible for them to stay on in his in-laws ' attic . For the first time , Orrin sensed that Edith was starting tentatively to withdraw from the wholehearted commitment she had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't charge her with it , since it never came all the way up to the surface , and Edith went about the household routine as though nothing had changed . Nevertheless he knew absolutely that she was coming to be disappointed in him . He could feel it even in the different way she held him and closed her eyes in their most intimate moments together , and it was galling . There were no houses to be had that year ( or the year beforeor the year after ) . It was Edith 's mother who finallyp115found them the flat behind the church with which she was affiliated ; just knowing how hard she 'd had to work on her minister and his board to get them the rooms was enough to make Orrin clench his teeth . He cursed himself to his face while he shaved , observing with contempt how his hair was falling out , and thinking how eager his mother-in-law must have been to be rid of them . The apartment behind the old white church was rentfree  --  there were even wages with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in return that it was out of the question for him to hold on to his old job . The church itself had to be reroofed , for a start ; the minister 's drive had to be graded and graveled , the windows of his study had to be rehung and reputtied ; the aisles of the church had to be mopped regularly , the sidewalks shoveled , the metal announcement board redleaded and repainted , the lawns mowed and trimmed . Orrin had become a handyman . During the years that Orrin held the sexton 's job he took on extra work here and there around town  --  hanging guttersand leaders , digging out septic tanks , installing automaticwashing machines . Edith had become somewhat settled , now that she had her own place and her own two little girls ; she was not quite so taut , although she remainedambitious for a better life for the four of them . She hinted strongly that she would be willing to get out and push Orrin 's career , the way girls did that she knew  --  exceptthat Orrin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to make a move asp116badly as Edith , but he did n't want anything undemanding . " Being a sexton is strictly for an old man , " he told his wife , " not for a young guy like me . There 's nothing in it to drive you ahead . " Against his better judgment , he joined the local Legion post . As he had suspected , they talked politics and women  --  two subjects that bored the pants off him  --  and most of them were men who had no right to belong to the same organization as men who had been in combat . But it was in the Legion bowling alley that he got wind of the gas station partnership deal , so he had no reason to begrudge the dues he paid . As soon as he was sure that the deal was open , and withouttelling Edith , he put his name down on the new housing development that was to go up not far from the service station itself . He could handle a GI mortgage , and on the ten-thousand-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasy , and he waited until the girls were soundly sleeping to talk to his wife . It was very quiet . Beyond their wall the choir was practicing hymns . " The two-bedroom units are going up fast , " he said . " We can move into one without waiting for the gas station deal to jell . If it falls through , so what ? The worst that can happen is that I 'll have to find another job . " Edith leaped up with that extraordinary agility she had when there was something she wanted to do in a hurry and flung herself onto his lap , her skirt flying up over herp117thighs . She yanked his tie down and ruffled his thinning hair . " Tell me about the gas station , Orrin , " she said excitedly . " I want to hear all about it  --  I know this is going to be it at last . " " It 's called the Lakeside Service Station and Restaurant . It belongs to George Werlitz 's uncle , who 's getting too slow for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What he wants is a younger fellow as a kind of junior partner that 'll sooner or later buy him out . " " We do n't know anything about running a diner . Is it a good spot ? " " It 's on Route Ninety-three . All the people that want to go fishing at the north end of the lake have to go by there . And we can learn , ca n't we ? " Shortly after they had moved into their new house , Orrin took out a GI loan to establish himself as a partner in the Lakeside Service Station and Restaurant , and Edith took over main charge of the diner . She liked the pressure almost as much as he did , and she was needed just as badly ; nevertheless , deliberately this time , she became pregnant again . It was a gamble , and they both knew what she was gambling on . But , for the third time , Edith was delivered of a girl . Freshly shaved and scrubbed , Orrin arrived at her bedside and found her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had greeted her with an intimacy that was somewhat forced because of the eagerly listening mother at the other end of the semiprivatep118room , she refused to face him , but spoke in muffled tones , holding the bed sheet to her lips . " What 's the matter , Edie ? I just saw the baby , it 's cute as any I ever saw . " " It 's a she . I suppose you 're going to pretend you do n't care . " Orrin would have been embarrassed even if he had been alone with his wife . He said placatingly , " I love the kids . You ca n't have a world without girls in it . " Edith twisted about convulsively . Ignoring her gaping roommate , she said loudly , " Do n't hand me that crap . It 's a man 's world . I always wished I was a man . Now I ca n't even have a son . " She began to sob . " What 's the matter ? Do n't you know how to make boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Take care of yourself . I 'll be back tonight after I close up . " Actually her bitter question was one he would have asked her , if he had dared . That was why she must have burst out at him , partly , to forestall him . She did not mention it again , nor did he , until after he had finally bought out old Werlitz and they were on their own at last , in their own home , with their own business . Edith had plunged back into the affairs of the diner as though she did not have three small children to care for ; the life of business seemed to draw her now as Orrin 's arms had drawn her in their first days together . She was happy , it seemed to him , even though by nightfall she was groggy with exhaustion ; and when they turned off the floodlights and went to bed forp119their six hours ' rest , she curled up dopily in his arms like a child kept up past its bedtime . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Route 93 was going to be straightened for a stretch of some twelve miles . When the job was done , the Lakeside Service Station would be standing on a semiabandoned country road , without a quarter of the traffic necessary to keep it solvent . And there was nothing that could be done . In a blind rage Orrin raced over to old man Werlitz 's and pounded on his front door ; but his wife said that he was in bed with bursitis . She swore that he had n't known of the road change when he had sold out . His nephew George , Orrin 's Legion buddy , was equally positive that his uncle would never pull such a trick . " It 's the breaks of the game , Orrin . " " But I 'm ruined , " he cried . " Do n't you see that ? The oil company might finance me onto the new highway if they wanted to , but I 'm tied up with the diner and all that land . How could I take on a new mortgage if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George 's sympathy amounted to an arm around his shoulders , but that was all . As for Edith , she was unwilling even to give him that much . She only stared at him in cold despair . " If you 'd had your wits about you , you would have known the old man was getting ready to pull a swifty . I told you his price was too good to be true , did n't I ? "  | " You told me . " He laughed shortly . " You 've been in this just as deep . " " That 's because I wanted to show you what I could do . " " You showed me already . You and your three girls . " " I knew you 'd hold it against me for the rest of my life . " She rubbed her hands together tautly ; the veins began to coil at her wrists . " What good would it do you to have a son ? You would n't have anything to pass on to him anyway . Except a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orrin had realized that he and Edith were never going to have any more children , and that he was going to be years in crawling out from under the mountain of debts with which he had saddled himself . Without consulting Edith , he sold out the business and got himself two jobs : one on the assembly line at the new automobile plant , the other working evenings and Saturdays at a lumberyard , loading orders onto trucks for the following morning'sdeliveries . He liked both jobs : the assembly line because he felt that once again , for the first time since the war , his enduranceand his courage were being tested continually and found up to the mark ; the lumberyard because it was startlinglyquiet after the thunderous factory , his footfalls echoingemptily in the dimly lighted yard as he clumped about in his steel-toed shoes with the yellow order forms in his hand , balancing kegs of nails on one shoulder , swinging out ten-foot molding strips and swaying sheets of plywood . Besides the extra pay check , he was able to buy lumberp121at wholesale for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sundays for the two older girls . This too he was doing without consultation , for there were a jumble of things he wanted to show Edith , not simply to discuss with her : that they were not only not going to lose the house , but were going to make it a bigger and better one ; that he was tough enough to handle three jobs at once ; and that he cared enough about his daughters to want to make their life more comfortable . Edith watched him in silence . She had never been much for small talk , any more than he ; it was not easy to guess how she felt about his having gone from businessman to factory worker . Once she did say : " There 's no point in your killing yourself , Orrin , " but when he had replied sharply , " I 'm healthy , " she had simply commented , " I want you to stay that way . You do n't prove anything by doing everythingat once . " That was how things stood when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone , figuring that it came from the use of muscles that had been inactive , just as a man 's calves will ache when he attempts to walk after having done nothing but drive for years . He took it as a new test of his fortitude . Eventually , he was sure , it would work itself out . The only trouble was that the hand did not get better . As the weeks on the line went by , it got so bad that when no one was looking he would whip off his thick cotton gloves and frantically massage the palm and fingers , press/ing and pressing in an effort to relieve the agonizing throbs that were starting to travel all the way up his forearm when he clenched his file and set to work . It did not help . After a while he began to think of the pain , as it burned its way through his hand , as a punishment and a trial , like the boils from which he had suffered without complaint during the last part of his hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loneliness , it became a companion to which he could talk silently . " Go away , you bastard , " he would whisper to it ; and if his attention were distracted , he would set to work and sometimes it really would go away . " Ah , " he would say , " so I got rid of you that time . " But at night after he had fallen asleep all five fingers would stiffen like the legs of a crab , and they would remain that way until he had gotten into the car , driven to the factory , and begun to file , when they would gradually loosen up , only to be invaded by the returning pain . It became more and more difficult to conceal the stiffening from his wife , until one night , thrashing about in his sleep , he rolled over onto the tautened right hand and awoke with an irrepressiblecry . Wide-awake in an instant , as mothers are , Edith snapped on her lamp . " Turn it off , " he muttered . " It was me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your hand , " she said , sharp as a ferret . " What 's wrong ? "  | " Nothing . It 's just a little stiff . Turn off the light . " " A little stiff ? It looks like a claw . Can I get you something ? Does it hurt a lot ? " " Just sometimes , " he replied , and could have kicked himself for his weakness . " Let 's go to sleep , Edie . I 'm tired . " " What do you mean , sometimes ? How long has it been like that ? " " Off and on for a while . " He turned over on his side , with his right arm hanging carefully over the edge of the bed , and closed his eyes . " Go to see a doctor . Promise me you 'll see a doctor . " " We 'll see . " He had no intention of seeing a doctor even though , now that Edith knew about the fingers , which were beginning to snap back and forth uncontrollably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , he saw no reason to go running for help just because she urged him to ; for another , beyond all his pride in the record he was setting on the body-shop line was the fear that a doctor might do something to jeopardize it . When he slashed his finger , though , catching his glove against the whirling edge of a grinding disc so that the cotton spun off and the disc bit into his flesh so viciously that blood spurted inside the torn glove all the way to the wrist , he had to go to the factory hospital . There the firstaidman wiped his hand clean and said , " Bend those fingers , will you , Mac , so I can make a neat bandage for you . " Wordlessly Orrin did as he was asked  | " Hey , " the orderly said , " you got a trigger finger there , you know ? " " What 's a trigger finger ? " " It clicks on you when you go to bend it , does n't it , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A couple of them are like that . It 'll go away , wo n't it ? " " Ca n't prove it by me . You can soak it in the whirlpool , or better yet let the orthopedist see it  --  he comes in Wednesdays . Get a pass from your foreman next Wednesdayfor ten-thirty , okay ? " Orrin had no intention of seeing an orthopedist . But Edith saw the bandage and at once asked what they had said about his hand . When he told her , she was insistent that the practical thing to do was to cover himself against future disability and insure compensation by seeing the specialist . Sheepishly , he asked Buster for a pass and walked on down to the hospital , past all those plant areas which seemed so soft and quiet , so clean and orderly , in comparison with the yelling , banging pressure of the body shop . It would be impossible for him , he thought , to stand around all day as these men did , clipping seat covers onto frames with small tools , spraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead conveyers , or clamping cables onto batteries : this was woman 's work , clean , dull , and deadly , and the men who did it looked incapable of getting down on their knees and working over a sheet of steel untilthe sweat streamed down and they remolded it to perfec/tion . No wonder they earned less than he did  --  they were replaceable by anybody with two hands . The orthopedist was a big bulky man in his forties , with a Masonic pin in the lapel of his tweed suit . He looked like a kindly former football player , and as Orrin extended his hand , palm up , for the examination , he knew that he would have to do what the doctor told him to  --  he felt , oddly , as though he were standing at attention before an officer about to give him orders . While the doctor poked and prodded gently , Orrin glanced at his own reflection in the gleaming chromium autoclave that stood against the tiled wall . He was astonished at how hangdog he looked , his bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinking into the blue coveralls . My God , he thought , I look older than he does , and he turned his gaze hesitantly to the doctor 's frank and friendly eyes . " You 've got a rare ailment , " the doctor smiled , " known as tenosynovitis . Must be millions of people who have it . " " Is that what they call trigger finger ? " " The same . It 's a callus growth around the sheath coveringthis tendon . The thicker it gets , the harder it is for the tendon to pull these fingers back and forth . In your case it 'll probably become worse from the nature of your work , I regret to say . " " So there 's nothing can be done ? " Orrin asked , almost with relief . " On the contrary , it 's fairly easy to fix . Massage it withp126cocoa butter from the second palmar crease toward this finger tip for a week . If that wo n't help , we 'll open the hand and scrape away the callus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it always does the trick . " Orrin simply did not have time to sit around smearing grease into his hand which he used more than twelve hours a day ; but he did it while he ate and during his relief time , for it seemed to him now that this slippery expedient was his last hope of avoiding the operation that represented in some indefinable way a threat to the continuity of his life . It did not work . The orthopedist , in a dark blue suit this time , as befitted one pronouncing sentence , took up Orrin 's hand with the same smiling gentleness and shook his head . " Let 's get it over with . The company will have you driven over to the hospital , so you name the day . I 'm there every morning , operating , except Wednesdays and Sun-days . " " Will I lose any time ? " The doctor put his thumbs in his vest , disclosing a row of cigars . " No reason why you should . You 'll be a little groggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest up for an hour I do n't see why you ca n't come back here and finish up the day . " " It is n't the money . " Orrin swallowed ; the hand was burning . " It 's just that . . . I ca n't hang around and not work . " " I think they 'll give you something to do . The way ourSocial Security system operates , a big company finds itp127cheaper to have you come in with one hand than for you to sit home until it heals , collecting compensation for lost time . That sends up their insurance premiums , you see ? " The intricacies of such large-scale bookkeeping were beyondOrrin , but he felt somewhat relieved . He reported to the hospital in good time and was led to the operating room , where he lay staring up at the great round light overhead , silently proffering his right arm up to anesthetist , surgeon , and nurse , half dreaming of the day he had lain like this in the base hospital cursing with shame and wearinessas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . In an hour they had finished injecting , cutting , scraping , and sewing , and he arose swaying from the table , rememberingfleetingly Edith and her narrow pelvis and the three girl babies she had borne , moaning and gritting her teeth , in this same building . Then ' he found himself in the companystation wagon , blinking in the unaccustomed noonday light , and before he knew it he was back in the ambitious noise and dirt of the body shop . He was greeted by Buster the foreman , who removed the cigar from his mouth , glanced appraisingly at the bandaged hand , and asked , " How 'd it go ? " Orrin shrugged . He felt uneasy in his street clothes , withoutthe coveralls , almost like one of the tourists who came through the plant in batches , " All right , I guess . It 'll be all right . Got a job for me ? "  | " You ca n't metal-finish with all them stitches . You know there 's no work on this line for one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hawks was the superintendent of the entire body shop ; Orrin had spoken to him only two or three times . His office was in a glass and metal island in the middle of the area ; it had five desks and telephones in as many cubicles for the engineers , inspectors , and technicians who drifted in and out . Waiting for Hawks , Orrin stood inconspicuously in a corner behind the glass with his arms clasped behind him , the good one supporting the throbbing one , watching the welders on the line before him , their cracking , sputtering guns strangely muted behind this thin glass barrier . Hawks walked in swiftly and with a side glance at Orrin picked up a telephone from an empty desk and muttered something into it , then hung up . He was a tall , sagging man with a broken nose and pendulous earlobes . Every day he wore a freshly starched immaculate white shirt with the cuffs turned back , and an incongruously flashy tie secured by a silver clasp in the shape of a dollar sign . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's up ? " Orrin extended his bandaged hand . " Buster said you could find a job for me . I just had this opened up this morning . " " God damn it . What do they think this is , a convalescent home ? " He looked sadly at Orrin , as though he were plead/ing for understanding . " You know there 's nothing in the body shop for a man with one hand . Sit down and take it easy , you must be still groggy . I 'll see what I can do . " Orrin sat tensely on the edge of a metal chair , waiting for his new assignment . He had no idea what they would ask him to do . What he really wondered was how Buster and the rest were making out without him . Hawks came back from one of the little cubicles where he had been muttering into a telephone . He hitched up his expensive slacks . " They need a man over in the chassis department . Go over to where they drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital , and ask for Big Tony . He 's a big dago , always has his hat on , always chews gum . Do n't forget to give him your clock number , or you wo n't get paid . " Orrin made for the chassis department and introduced himself to Big Tony , who put down his clipboard and looked at him dubiously . " Can you drive with one hand ? " " I can use the arm to steer . " " This kid 's partner is out today . Take every other job as it gets to the end of the line . Do n't forget they 've never been driven , they 're stiff  --  the eights should start , the sixes you got to choke . Watch for the automatic shift and the regular shift . There 's only three places to take a job  --  over the pit for brake inspection , over onto that other line , or into the corner for repairs . I 'll signal you which one to take . Go ahead , start this one up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again . The cars came off fast ; sometimes he could n't get them started , sometimes the automatic shift would n't work , sometimes there was n't any seat inside and he had to steer from the floor , sometimes he drove into the wrong lane and had Big Tony howling curses at him . But it was good work for a one-armed man , and the time spun by so fast that he was astonished when the day was over . " Boy , this was a tough one , " sighed the youngster with whom he had been alternating jobs all day . " One of the toughest ever . " Orrin stared at him in disgust . The lad was no more than eighteen , myopic , with soft arms and a pimply forehead over his heavy eyeglasses . He said to him curiously , " How long have you been working here , anyway ? " " Two long months . " " Well , you ought to come on over to the body shop and find out what real work is like . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " This job was just right for me with one hand . If I had two hands , I 'd fall asleep on it  --  and I 'm practically twice your age . " Nevertheless , the following morning Orrin punched in quickly and hastened over to look up the boy . He saw him sitting by the huge air duct which sucked up the carbon monoxide as the cars came off the line . " Okay , kid , " he said . " I 'm back to give you a hand again . "  | " Gee , I 'm sorry , " the boy replied , " but my partner 's back today . " Orrin found himself waiting for an assignment once again on the edge of the metal chair in the body shop office . It was an hour and a half before Hawks came up and said absently , " See Buster . He 'll give you something . " Until Hawks said these words Orrin had been shrinking down in the chair , avoiding the glances of the engineers and inspectors as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonexistent executive who would come up to him and nudge him with his toe like someone tipping over a stone and say to him , " What are you doing for your pay , sitting there and staring off into space when everyone else in this plant is working like a dog ? " Now he arose , knowing that he had no answer , and walked slowly down the aisles to Buster , who stood at his desk painstakingly filling out requisition slips for tool repairs . Buster glanced up and said , " Oh , it 's you , " and at once led him away , as though afraid that Orrin would ask for permission to stay right there . Orrin tagged after him silently , not walking alongside him so that Buster would feel that he had to make conversation . The foreman led him to a darkish corner at the rear end of the line at the beginning of the body shop , near the jigs where the bodies were first assembled , and indicated several barrels filled with small clips standing under a table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clips to the blackp132ones , like this . Make sure the narrow end is on top . Then take this can and brush and give them a smear , it 's an oxidefor rust . Can you do it one-handed ? " Orrin nodded wordlessly . " Main thing is to keep ahead of that colored guy . He works here alone , mounts these to every job as you get them ready . " He indicated a ghostlike Negro , humped and talking to himself at the far end of the line . Orrin reached out and touched Buster 's arm . " Who usually does this job ? " " Generally the colored guy does the whole thing himself . But they gave him one extra operation and it got to be too much . So I told Hawks and the time-study man to let you do this until they re-evaluate the job . " So he was being given made work . Leaning his hip against the work bench , Orrin watched , his insides quivering , as Buster without troubling to take the cigar from his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as a kind of demonstration . Controlling his voice , Orrin asked , " What about my re-lief ? " Buster smiled . " You wo n't kill yourself on this job . I ca n't spare the relief man for it . Take a twelve-minute break whenever you feel like it and you 're far enough ahead . Take it easy , Orrin . " In the days that followed , Orrin learned what it meant to be stupefied . Mindlessly he snapped the little clips together ,  |p133hundreds  of them , thousands of them , his fingertips doing the childish little endlessly repeated trick while his mind was utterly free to roam as it pleased . For a while he amused himself as , he thought , any intelligent man would  --  by devisingnew and simpler ways to do the work , by laying out the clips in overlapping rows before beginning to snap them together , by spreading out the finished groups so that they could all be painted at once  --  but then there was nothing left for him to improve upon , the whole operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to get behind , dawdling along until the Negro assembler looked nervously at the dwindling pile of clips , and then working frenziedly to catch up . That was a game that could not be repeated indefinitely , though , and finally he simply slouched over the table , slipping the pieces together and dreaming  --  dreaming of the exalted moments of his past life , dwindled away now to little trinkets that had to be fitted together and smeared anyhow with paint . He was home early evenings , since he could not work at the lumberyard , but if he could have thought of another place to go , he would have . Edith wanted to mother him and claimed it was nice to have him around for a change , and it drove him wild , as if he were already an old man finishing out his life as a night watchman , with a wife who plumped up his pillows and cut his corns for him . " Ca n't you see I 'm sick of it all ? " he burst out one night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about thep134hand , this would never have happened . I was working hard , pulling us out of the hole . I was the key man on the line , and now they 've got me sorting nuts and bolts . " " I do n't see what 's so terrible if you take it easy for a while . You 're still on the payroll . And you 'll get back the money you 're losing at the lumberyard in your workmen 's compensation . Besides "  --  she looked at him narrowly  --  " you did n't want to stay on that assembly line forever , did you ? I bet those other men you worked with would give anything to trade jobs with you right now . " That was the truth . But it did n't say much for the rest of the men . The next day he took a walk over to the line during his relief period , for the first time since he had been put in the corner with the Negro . Buster was standing there with his cigar in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jobs as they went by and cursing out the men who had missed low spots . The line was moving fast , and everyone was working hard and steady ; occasionally Walter or Pop the inspector or one of the others would look up and wave to him , but no one had time to come over and talk until Harold the pick-up man , his long , drunkard 's nose twitching and his big Adam 's apple bobbing like an alligator'ssnout , brushed up to him for a moment . Harold pointed with his buffer to a tall , tawny Negro with oriental eyes who was grinding away at a high spot , his long legs bent in a catcher 's stance . " That 's your replacement , " Harold said . " Not as good as you , but he knows his stuff . Life goes on , eh , Orrin ? Inp135point of fact , no matter what you do or how well you do it , there 's always somebody around waiting to take over . " In a sudden rage , Orrin wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . But before he could move , Harold himself went back to the job , waving negligently at him as he left . Orrin stood for an instant , then walked over to Buster , now chewing his cigar like a cud and staring vacantly into space beyond the moving line . " Hi , Buster , " Orrin said . " Thought I 'd come over during my break . " " How you making out over there , Orrin ? " Buster asked incuriously . " To tell you the truth , I 'm going crazy . It 's not for me . I was wondering if  --  " " Excuse me , " Buster muttered , and sprang forward to the bonderizing booth , where Hawks had turned up , alternately waving for Buster to hurry and arguing heatedly with Halstein , the chief inspector . Orrin turned and walked slowly down the aisles to his little corner , where the silent Negro was helping himself to a handful of painted clips . " Fixing to do some myself if you did n't get back soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Orrin absently . He made up a little batch for the man and then pulled back the bandage from his palm , peering into the dark area to see how the stitches were healing . It would have to be soon , he thought ; if it did n't heal soon . . . If I was a kid , he thought , I 'd run away from home . The next morning , as he mooned over the little metalp136snippets , remembering how Edith had once shown him the japanned box in which she kept all his V-mail from overseas , his commendation , and his ribbons , and wondering where that box was now , probably stuck away in a bottom drawer with a bunch of slips that needed mending , he was surprised to see Buster coming towards him with a young white-collar fellow in a brown gabardine suit , even balder than he was , whom he recognized as being from the payroll department . " Fellow wants to talk to you for a minute , Orrin . " " I 've got all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember last year , I came around to sign you up for your metal finisher 's pay . " " I remember . " " I understand that since your injury and operation , you have been unable to perform metal finisher 's work . " " Well , naturally . . . Say , wait a minute . " Orrin flung aside the metal clips with which he had been toying . " Are you trying to tell me  --  " " I 'm only doing my job , fellow . " " Do n't fellow me . You want to cut my pay , do n't you ? I ruin the damn hand metal-finishing and then you want to take away my metal finisher 's pay . Well , you can take the stinking job and  --  " " Take it easy , Orrin , " Buster said uncomfortably . " It 's nothing personal . This guy 's got a job to do like anybody around here . "  |p137Orrin  felt himself trembling from head to foot . " Is this the way they repay you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your lunch box when you go out , to make sure you did n't steal five cents ' worth of sandpaper . The hand 's practically healed , I can go back to metal-finishing in a day or two , but that 's not enough , is it ? You got to take the lousy petty couple of dollars for these few days out of my hide . All right , take the money . And take the job too . " " It 's got nothing to do with you or me . As soon as you go back on your old work , you go back on your old rate . You get paid for what you do  --  they ca n't make excep-tions . " " I 'm not talking about exceptions . I 'm talking about whether a man is a human being or a piece of . . . My God , " he cried out in anguish , " I might just as well have worked like all the others all year  --  nobody cares that I did my best . " Buster took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the brown suit . " Listen to me and do n't be a jerk , " he said intently . " You 're not a kid to throw away a job just like that , you 're a family man . Do n't make a stink about the lousy five bucks , or whatever it is . They do n't want to punish you for your operation , the place is too big , one hand does n't know what the other one is doing . I was n't supposed to tell you , but you 're in line for a foreman 's job on the night shift if you want . As soon as you get back on production again , Hawks is going to call you in . " Hep138nudged Orrin . " You know what I 'm making , it 's better than what you make . On salary , plus overtime , plus nightshiftbonus , you 'll do all right . " " Night shift , " Orrin said slowly . " They need bosses for nights . What do you care ? " Buster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't have to be home at night . You 'll start fresh  --  new faces , you know ? It 's a break , Orrin . You do n't want to be working all your life . I worked for sixteen years before they made me a boss . " Orrin thought of the living room where he hid from his wife behind the sports page of the paper at night ; of the bedroom where she lay waiting for him when he worked alone in the lumberyard and came home late ; of the halffinishedchildren 's room in the attic waiting for him to attackit once again , a final test of his fortitude . Then he looked at the bald-headed white-collar fellow as he stood waiting patiently with his ball-point pen and his little forms to be filled out , and he thought of the energy that he 'd poured down the drain on job after job until now he was thirty-three and with nowhere to retreat beyond this ugly place where he had made his last-ditch resistance . Now he was being asked to sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk , a little red in the face , then at Buster , holding a flaring lighter to his cigar stump , then at the solemn Negro , who had stopped work and was staring at the three of them , and he sighed . " All right , " he said at last . " Show me where to sign . "  |p139HAROLD  'S hands were like the rest of him , long , bony , pale , and skillful . Except when he had a hang-over , they responded to every demand for swiftness and assurance . Now that he had gone on the wagon they were once again as supple and dextrous as they had been during his best days in the commercial-art field . The coarser work demanded by the auto-assembly line was more trying , but when they had hardened themselves to the sterner pressures of file and hammerthey did not protest . The rest of his body gave Harold somewhat more trouble . He was not used to standing on his feet for long hours without leaning on a bottle , and his thighs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly during his first few weeks on the line in the body shop . He was a man of thirtynine , accustomed to sitting hunched over a drawing board ,  |p140accustomed  , too , to being primed with liquor even before brushing his teeth , but he was willing to bear this new miserypatiently . It semed reasonable to hope that it would pass more quickly than other miseries he 'd had in his time . " Aches and pains are nothing , " he said to Buster , his foreman , with whom he had gotten along well from their very first meeting . " You can always buy a bottle of liniment . It 's the heartache that you have to watch out for . I 've swalloweda lot of internal medicine for that , and it never did me a bit of good . " Buster had taken a liking to Harold at once . He had never had occasion to talk with a professional artist , and he was plainly impressed . Besides , although his own brotherin-lawwas practically a rumhead , he had never before met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm an alcoholic . " Harold knew that the foreman 's friendliness mixed snobberyand curiosity , but he had no objection as long as it made Buster go a little easier on him . The desire to be friendly with someone whose background you associated with prestige and good living was only human . As for the nosiness , there could n't have been any if Harold himself had n't come out and said he was a drunk . That was one of the few things , he thought wryly as he ground away at the job before him , that no one had explained to this drunkard working at becoming an exdrunkard . All the doctors and the A.A. boys were ready with one explanation after another of the drinking compul/sion ; but none of them had come up with an explanation of the damned compulsion to talk about it once you had quit , except that it was supposed to be part of the therapy to share your story . Soon after Harold 's probationary period was up , Buster said , " I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra overtime , this is your chance . It 's always the pick-up men that get asked first to stay on to clean up the dead-line , and sometimes to metal-finish over in final paint . " " Thank you , boss . I appreciate it . " " You 've been doing good work . And I know you 're one of the few that never turns down overtime . Besides , " he added in a burst of candor , " some guys just wo n't stay on pick-up . All that grinding , they 're afraid of the lead getting in their lungs . " " I 've put worse things in my insides in my time , " replied Harold . " I 'll take my chances with the lead if I can have the overtime . " " Here , start on this job . On pick-up you have n't got time to do much filing , unless the supervisor or the inspectors make you . You 're responsible for a smooth finish on all the lead that 's been flowed on , so grind around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the chrome trim goes . I 'll show you the rest as you go along . " Harold was bluntly and unashamedly anxious for the overtime . The money part he did n't have to speak of . The other part he had no hesitation in explaining . " The longer I work on the line , " he said , not only top141Buster but to the other pick-up men and to Pop the inspector , " the more I knock myself out , the less chance there is of my falling off the wagon . I might as well get paid for taking the treatment . " Perhaps there was an element of self-pity in his explanation , of appealing to the others for sympathy . Harold thought of that , but it did n't interest him much one way or the other . He did n't feel like an object of pity , not now that he was making his own way , and he worked sixty and seventyhours a week the way other men work forty . Once the line had stopped , after eight or nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave him to do ; he felt that he was coasting , and his weariness wore off as the eleventh and even the twelfth hour wore by . One day it would be the dead-line , that long row of rejected bodies next to the bonderizingbooth which had to be repaired to pass inspection ; another day it would be similarly rejected cars which had already been completely assembled and painted . In either case Harold was content to stay on . With the jobs standing still and obediently waiting for him to finish them to perfection , there was no pressure on him , and he was free to taper off from the steady grind of meeting every other job as it moved up to him on the platform at the end of the assembly line . Besides , he was free to daydream . The truth was that once his body had stopped complainingthe automobile factory had no physical reality for Harold . This he dared not explain to anyone ; he sensed that it was far more dangerous than confessing that you were ap143lush , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward those with whom you shared this state of suspended being . Nevertheless it was so . Harold  --  who knew himself as a tall , sallow , Adam's-appled , pompadoured , stoop-shouldered commercial artist and a quart-and-a-pint-a-day man  --  felt that he had no present , that he hung suspended between past and future , both of which grew more vivid as his sense of present reality recededeerily into infinity like the girl in the di Chirico paintingrolling a hoop into nothingness . The present had no texture for him partly by contrast with the richly pain-laden past , much of which he was able to describe aloud with the fiat jocularity of a travel guide , inserting a little joke now and then to liven up the historical stretches . Harold knew that it was possible for him to expresshis feelings about the past to the men on the line only because the men partook of the present 's unreality , and could not color the black-and-white picture he drew for them . They were simply receptacles for his recapitulation of how it had come about that he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letterer and better poster man , found himself in this unlikely sunlit nightmare . At that , there were things he could n't tell them , memoriesfloating up to consciousness in the wake of other flotsam that he dredged up for their delectation . " How 'd you get started drinking , Harold ? " the foreman worked up the courage to ask . This was after Harold had stated that his liquor bills , even when he was workingp144steady and only drinking the way other people chewed gum , had run to eight bucks a day . " Been drinking ever since I can remember , " Harold replied . " In point of fact , bootleg booze was always around the house . I can recall being drunk when I was six or seven years old , from sampling leftovers . " " But how come your folks let you drink ? " " There was just my father . He was a hard drinker himself , and he could n't keep his eye on me . By the time I was in high school I always had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kids used to whisper about me . " This was impressive , shocking even , for the men on the line . But they had no way of knowing how it had been in fine detail . They could n't know without his telling them , which he did n't , that since Harold 's father had been accountantfor a paper-cup company , his house had always been one vast litter of paper cups . Harold 's earliest memory was of crawling around on the parlor floor pushing a train made of the long cardboard cartons that the cups came in ; and later of stringing the stark-white cones into necklaces and festoons which lay around gathering dust , waiting for the occasional cleaning woman to sweep them into the garbagecan . He could not have been very long out of kindergartenwhen he discovered that many of the fiat-bottomed kind , the ones his father left standing around on dressers and end tables , had a few drops of burning liquid in them . Harold grew to learn that the drinks his father left lying around helped put him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " waiting in vain for someone to tuck him in . Often , very often , there were strange women who came in after dinner and danced to the Atwater Kent console until Harold 's bedtime . Then while he lay in bed hugging his koala bear , they would really begin to carouse  --  Harold 's father and his woman of the evening  --  howling , cursing , breaking glass despite the abundance of paper cups . Sometimesthey would still be there in the morning when he paddedpast his father 's door in his Doctor Dentons . As he grew older , he would lie in bed with the bootleg whisky in the paper cups , envying not his burly , roaring father , who seemed never to want for the company of passionateand loving women , but the women themselves for the exclusive attention they received from Daddy . But in realitythere could not have been so very many evenings when he lay huddled in bed drinking the corn he had learned to dilute with water and wishing he were the roistering woman locked in with his father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In retrospect , Harold was inclined to suspect that the reasons for his drinking were both deeper and shallower . In either case , they were less spectacular . He had always been agonizingly shy as a kid , and the little things that heightened his feelings of inadequacy and aloneness were so little that they hardly seemed worth building into salesworthy reminiscence : the only kid in the class who had nobody come to Open House , even though his father had done him a favor and joined the P.T.A. ; the kid who always ate lunch alone in the schoolp146basement because the housekeepers who made his halfheartedpeanut-butter sandwiches never thought to insert any tradable home-baked cookies ; the kid who never dated in high school but had the nerve  --  after a quick snifter from the bottle stashed in his locker  --  to tell the vice-principalto go screw in front of everybody . . . Anyway , liquor had been the Great Lubricator for him . But Buster , intent on condemning the monster who could carelessly poison an only son , said to him one day , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you do n't mind my saying so , but he must have been one son of a bitch . " " Oh , he was . " Harold nodded his head judiciously . " Still . . . he managed to hold down his job all those years . In point of fact , he was an officer of the company toward the end . He was at a sales conference at the Hotel Pontiac in Buffalo when he died of apoplexy . Actually , he was in the sack with a floozy , celebrating Repeal . I was seventeen . " Buster shook his head sadly . " No wonder you took to drink . " " Oh , but I 'll tell you something . He surprised me . I mean after he died . He left me ten thousand bucks in cold cash , and he had it tied up so that I could only use it to go to school  --  so much a year , and I had to get passing marks . So he guaranteed my college education that way . Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you ? " Buster was more impressed with the revelation that Haroldwas indeed a college man . He would have found it hardp147to understand that , given the great opportunity , Harold had muffed it . He had majored in art , and he had gotten the grades necessary for his allowance , but he had been lonely and miserable , convinced after a while that he was headed noplace in the fine-arts world and that he was never going to be popular as a person . He got on best at college with the heavy drinkers ; but they were a very social lot , and in their company  --  particularly when they started making vacationplans together  --  Harold felt very much the lonely orphan . Two years after graduation he had been through four jobs and he needed at least a pint to get through the day , not counting the quick ones whenever he passed a bar . It was at an Eighth Street bar that he met Marie one tuberculouswinter 's night . He had just been fired from the fourth job and was well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin blond Jewess in rayon slacks , touched him on the arm and asked him why he was unhappy . It was the sort of thing that could happen in the Village , before the war . Six weeks later they were married , because he was terrifiedof losing her and because Marie felt it would hurt her parents less if she brought home as a husband a pale , underfedGentile with a big Adam 's apple than if they were to discover that she had been living in sin . She and Harold had two years together before Pearl Harbor , and then she followed him from one camp to another until he was shipped out.  |p148Three  different men on the line asked : " Did she know you drank when she married you ? " " That was how we met , " he would reply , showing his long , discolored teeth . " I often thought she married me because I drank . It gave her a chance to mother me . " And it gave her somebody to feel superior to , he thought ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she was . Or was he only trying to evade his guilt at what he had done to the only person who had ever really loved him by stepping on her memory with his heel as he stepped on his own ? Once he was thousands of miles from home he had virtuallyquit drinking . It was n't , oddly enough , until he was beingrotated back home from the Islands that he had gone on a terrible bat aboard the troop transport . Shy as he was , and sly as he was , he 'd sweet-talked the denatured alcohol out of the ship 's carpenter and jimmied the grapefruit juice from the locked galley , and then set up a still . The other heroes had been lucky enough to vomit their insides out , but he had had the lion 's share and as a result was stone-blind for the last two weeks of the voyage . He had gotten his sight back just two days before docking . When he and Marie finally fell into each other 's unfamiliararms , each wept at the other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to Marie 's Villageapartment and to the teaching job she had gotten when it became clear that her sculpture would not go . There came a time , all too soon , when Harold could n't hangp149around the female place alone while she was back at her blackboard ; but remembering with terror the blindness , he dared not pull up a stool at the corner tavern . " My wife made a thing out of letting me get to be a civilianagain , " Harold said affectionately . " The longer I took to do it , the more casual she got about it . She must have read someplace that that was the way to handle the problem . Maybe she wrote a letter to Dorothy Dix . " " But the drinking . . . " " In point of fact , Buster , " Harold replied , " I got to feel after a while that I 'd be doing Marie a favor if I went out and tied one on . She was silently begging for the opportunity to nurse me . Did n't she deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working and hubby was n't ? " Buster was bemused by this , and Harold was led to considerjust how much of what he had been confiding in the foreman was true , anyway , and how much was a kind of inversebragging . Am I still taking everything out on Marie , he wondered , after all these years ? Am I still flogging her for being patient with me and kind to me , instead of . . . of what ? What else did I want of her ? Nevertheless it was true that he had gone back to the old medicine to keep his upper lip stiff and that its immediateeffect had been to give Marie a good workable explanation of why his reconversion was being delayed . They 'd shuffled along like that for a while , with him barging in stinko from the jobs he held for a week or a month , yellingp150back at the neighbors who pounded on the pipes , and yieldingwhile Marie ice-bagged and prune-juiced him back into shape . But it got worse , as it had to , and chasms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't getting any younger ; and when was he going to start taking some of the load off her back ; and was n't it time that he discovered that there was more to life than bottle parties , nausea , and amnesia . What happened was that he discovered something else . He discovered that he was not merely a hard drinker , but a drunk . For a time he took a vicious satisfaction in believing that the final shove overboard had been Marie 's crying the blues about babies ( the very thought panicked him ) and jobs ( each was stupider than the preceding one , and boredomset in increasingly fast when he parked his fanny before a drawing board ) , and that if she had n't started to play wifey in such frightening earnest he might have gone on handling the stuff as he had been able to more or less before the war ; but after a while , when he was on a sustaining programof a quart and a pint a day , none of the reasons for it seemed to matter much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , like two characters in a comic strip that he was drawing barnsock-zowiefor posterity instead of for money . Good and loaded , he had told off the Brooklyn in-laws during what he had n't even known were the High Holidays , and Marie 's brothers had thrown him bodily out of the old folks ' apartment on Eastern Parkway . Bad and loaded , he had encoun/tered the advertising agency art director who was his currentboss munching shrimp with his mistress at a flossy sidewalk restaurant , had swiped a shrimp from the bulbous mistress 's plate , and wound up  --  one remark leading to another and the fancy lady flouncing furiously from the table  --  being boosted past the curb by the headwaiter and two bellboys , with Marie desperately and hopelessly trying to quiet him , free him from the hotel stooges , and commandeera cab . As a last straw , when she had found him well-stiffed in a quiet bar , he had street-fought his sobbing wife up and down Lexington Avenue in broad daylight , yelling after her things about the Jews that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her more than a black-and-blue beating . That did it . Marie got a new lock for the door and he went out like a light . When he came to four days later in a mission on West Forty-second around Tenth Avenue , he found purple bruises in unmentionable places on his body . The left hip pocket , the one in which he kept his wallet , had been cut out of his pants with a razor blade . The fine points of all this , the detailed itinerary of his odyssey , so to speak , he did not touch on when he recountedhis past to his foreman and to the one or two others on the line who served as the recipients of these confidences . Harold did not feel that he was holding back unfairly ; on the contrary , he was proud of his ability to strip the past and serve its bare bones objectively . He tended sometimes to repeat himself and sometimes to foul up thep152chronology , but by and large he gave his working companionswhat sounded like an honest outline . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told them , " but I was damned if I 'd admit that I was nothing more than a bum . After Marie threw me out , it began to look as though I could n't be one without being the other . That was what scared me , more than the idea that I was tied to the booze like a kid to a balloon . I was drinking over on the East Side by then because they knew me in the Village and did n't want any part of me , and finally I got right into the gutter with the winos down on the corner of Canal and the Bowery , waiting with a dust rag for the light to turn red to wipe your windshield and bum a dime toward a bottle of sherry or the price of a flop . " Never mind that he had n't actually done that . He had panhandled for the first and last time over on Cortlandt Street , where there was small likelihood of being recognized , and had promptly bumped by agonizing chance into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a middle-aging Gold Star father who owned a letter shop , had five employees , and kept his dead son 's tinted photo on his desk . Schwartz would n't let him crawl away , pulled him into one of those White Rose taverns where bums and businessmenmingle over pastrami and knackwurst , and with nobody paying any attention bought them a couple of beers . Then he gave him twenty-five and told him to get the hell out of town , told him to get a factory job at the new auto plant and wear himself out working for a while.  | " Well , gents , I 've been here now exactly two hundred and fifty-three days , not counting a little siege of grippe , and I have n't had one drink in all that time . Paid my rent , bought a car  --  first one I ever owned  --  and even put away a little something . Came here out of curiosity and used it up in a hurry , but in point of fact how could I say I 'm sorry ? " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were only one or two other questions that he could answer . Such as : " Did you finally get divorced ? " " Oh no , no . " He kept it casual . " I 'll be seeing Marie again one of these days . " This telescoped the whole period , starting from the time he had written Marie giving her his new address , with no answer ; to the time he had written her that he had been working on the line for eighty-seven days without a drink , with no answer ; for a hundred and ninetyfourdays without a drink but with plenty of overtime and double features on restless nights , with no answer . After nine months he had written : DEAR MARIE , I hope the reason you have n't been answering is that you 've been waiting to see does he mean business . I think 270 days of gruelling hard work and NO DRINKS is business and I am praying that you will answer now . There was no sense before in my saying I was sorry . You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove it to you . But I hope you believe me now , since you always used to sayp154Actions speak louder etc . I 'm NOT appealing to your pity . I 'm not even asking to come back on the old terms because it would n't do either of us any good . But I have to have something to look forward to if I am going to finish my comeback . So would you just write and say you 're all right . Just let me start to look ahead instead of rehashing the past and I know you will find that I am a different person . Do n't let me down . HAROLDThat one she had answered : DEAR HAROLD , Frankly , I did n't think after all these years you 'd have the guts to do what you are doing . I have n't answered because I thought if I did you 'd come back here and the whole business would only start all over again . But I am keeping my fingers crossed for you , and from now on I promise to answer your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since I have all my evenings free I have gone into leather work . It is much more satisfyingnow than working with stone . Less surprises , but you 're sure it will turn out worth while . M.So now here he was . It was true at last that he was corresponding with his wife , now that he had no more debt to Schwartz ( at least no more money debt ) , a paid-up car , a bank account , and a dry palate . Once he had brought himself up to date there was simply nothing more he could add to his summation of the past without unfairly revealing thep155unreality of the present or exposing the delicate shape of the future , of which he was now free to daydream constantly . He had made a funny pen-and-ink sketch of himself banging out dents in the body shop which he had rolled into a tube and sent to Marie , figuring shrewdly that it would mean more to her than a wedding anniversary presentchosen from an arty gift shoppe . From her he had received a calfskin wallet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with private symbols which no one else could have recognized , recalling better days . This is to hold all that money you 're saving , she had written , and after that he had written to ask when he could come to see her . For now he had achieved every limited goal he had set himself but that of reunion with his wife . He was perfectly convinced at last that alcohol was a poison for him . He had certainly reached a point of distance from which he could speak of his past frankly to people like Buster , who were friendly but really meant nothing to him . And most importantof all he had proved to himself and now to Marie that he could last out a life which was so regular , so routinized , so howlingly dull that it made his previous commercialart jobs seem like skin diving for sunken Phoenician barges off the Riviera dei Fiori . I have done it , he wrote to Marie , and I am doing it . In the evenings I go to the movies , one after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect mechantimeI punch in and I punch out , and in between withoutp156ical man , well liked by one and all and even good at what I do . Whoever would have guessed it ? And Marie was answering ( for he had attained the fourth of his five goals , that of re-establishing contact with his wife ) with increasingenthusiasm and pride in his comeback from alcoholism to anonymity , dropping little hints here and there , not unlikethe newspaper filler items about yak production in Tibetor decreases in the disease rate of Uruguayan sheep , that an artist with a clear eye and a steady hand would have exciting opportunities in the television world . Of course there was a catch to it all . There had to be , just as there always was when an elderly bookkeeper won a walking race , or a suburban mother of three won a trip around the world by correctly answering pathological questions about tropical diseases . In Harold 's case the trick of keeping his equilibrium on the line ( sometimes he thought of himself as a tightrope walker who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the present and forging  --  now that he had bared the past to his fellow wraiths  --  a chain of the most delectable daydreams . The dreams , for all their insubstantiality and vagueness , were so sunny and delightful that , just as he used to wait impatiently for the liquor store to open , so now he could hardly wait for morning , to begin grinding and filing and buffing , and then gradually to immerse himself in the warm bath of the future , released at last from bondage to bottle or machine . Marie did her bit all unknowingly  --  or did she know ?  --   |p157by  dangling before him the prospect of money , success , and the penitence of those who had once wronged him by doubting his core of sobriety and his essential ability . She would not , in response to his pleas , tell him when he should come , or even set some arbitrary deadline after which he could return in triumph . Instead , egged on , Haroldsuspected in those moments of black doubt that still assailed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote that she was going to leave the date and circumstances of their eventual reunion to Harold 's own considered judgment , and that this indeed was to be his final step in the achievement of self-mastery . So Harold , free to dream , fantasied everything  --  the works , the whole game  --  at least , up to a point . Bankbookin hand , he tapped the horn lightly before the gaping apartment house , and Marie , thinner , yes , but wide-eyed at his natty smile and his Simonized automobile , came runningout to take him by an arm more heavily-muscled than she had ever known it . After that the daydream stubbornly refused to proceed . Refractory as a torn strip of film which stops feeding itself through the machine just as the romance is at its most tantalizing and flashes off instead the upside-down reel numbers before blacking out completely , his dream refused to budge further . Its recalcitrance was not maddening to Harold , only puzzling , and therefore challenging . He was perfectly content to start up the dream over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a few days the ques/tion What comes next ? was resolved in fantasy only in a generalized glow of sunny prosperity and mutually loving contentment for himself and Marie , a hazy but voluptuous aura without source and without end . It was so good that Harold could stop thinking of it at any point and go off to lunch , to the toilet , or to a particularly difficult job with two inspectors and an engineer hanging over him and then return to it without skipping a beat . Nevertheless , only Marie 's letters and his bankbook linked the actual present to any realizable future . Harold 's exuberance over his steadily mounting savings was tempered by an uncomfortable awareness  --  despite Marie 's delicacy in never once referring to it  --  that he had never sent her so much as a dime from the day all this had started . Still , he had it now , cash that he just had n't had in all the mottled and blotched years since the war . One Saturday morning , standing at the teller 's window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , and then he looked up in triumphand smiled into the startled teller 's number-bound eyes . I am ready , he said to himself . He hastened back to his room to compose a letter to Marie , advising her that if it was all right with her he would work through the coming week and would leave for the city directly after work on Friday , stopping only for a quick bite . Her reply was waiting for him on Tuesday evening when he arrived at the rooming house , weary and needing a bath . The envelope stood on end on top of Life magazine ,  |p159|pro|p|ped  against the discolored brass lamp on the hall table . His heart was pounding fast , and as he reached out for the letter with the familiar handwriting , he had the feeling that there was a hand inside the envelope reaching out for his too . All day Wednesday he could not make up his mind whether to announce to the men on the line that he was driving down to see his wife on Friday night . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future ; on the other hand , it seemed to him now that only cowardice could possibly keep him from mentioning something as ordinary as what he planned . That night he could not sleep , and it was raining too hard for a trip to the movies . He heard the television going down in the parlor ; he tucked his shirt into his pants , lettingthe belt out a notch ( how he 'd fattened since going on the wagon ! ) , and pattered downstairs in his slippers to join the landlady on the sofa . He watched her screen until his eyes crossed , captured more by the commercials than by the programs they paid for . For a man of his taste and his talents , there was more imaginative appeal in the commercialsthan in the entertainment they surrounded . But then , thinking of what Marie had already written about **27;10392;TOOLONG in television and of what he would have to do if he were to make his daydreams come true , he began to grow anxious . To his intense annoyance , he discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to bed.  |p160First  thing next morning he slipped in a casual remark that Friday evening he 'd be off to see his wife . The revelationaroused no more curiosity than if he had announced his intention to go to a night ball game . Orrin was going to spend the week end at his lumberyard job and his house remodeling ; Benny , the colored pick-up man , had a job driving a truck ; Tommy , who went to night school , had exams to bone up on ; the new man , a recently returned old-timer named Frank , was going to the trotters Friday night . Harold was chagrined when he saw that his news was scarcely commented on . He said nothing more about it . But on Friday he arose before dawn to get his things together , shave , and bathe . He wore his good clothes to work and changed into his usual gray cotton shirt and trousers in the locker room . Something told him that it would be better to go straight to Marie from the factory ; maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooming house he might find a last-minute change of mind propped against the lamp on the hall table . Buster rotated his cigar and eyed him nonchalantly . " Want some overtime today , Harold ? Going to be a couple hours ' work on the dead-line . " " No , thanks . " It was the first time he had ever declined . " Going to New York as soon as we knock off . Have to meet my wife . " " Oh , that 's right , " Buster said . " You told me , I forgot . Sop161I guess you wo n't want to work tomorrow if we get the call . " Harold shook his head and glanced at his watch . " Not this week end . " He fought off a strong , irrational desire to pull back the cuff of his glove and sneak another look at the watch he had just examined . Filing furiously , working harder than he had in a long time in order to speed the hour , he wondered if the others on the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look forward to . He had arranged his schedule with the relief man so that his break came almost at the end of the shift  --  it would enable him to hurry off scrubbed and clean , but it also made the day longer . At last the relief man showed up and said , " Take twelve minutes , Harold , " and he made for the bathroom . He lathered up well , turning his wiry , hairless arms carefully to make sure that the dirt above and behind the elbowswas gone , and he soaked his hair too , so that it would comb easily . As rigid as an actor awaiting his on-stage cue on opening night , he inspected his farmer 's Adam 's apple in the mirror for spots maybe missed with the razor at dawn , and brought his wet , stiff rows of hair into a tall , sliding pompadour . When the siren blew , he punched out silently . As he was dropping his time card into the rack , Frank , the new oldtimer , clapped him on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See you Monday , right ? "  | " Do n't be too sure , " Harold replied over his shoulder , and went off hurriedly to avoid questions . But it was so : who could predict the future ? Maybe he would be coming back just to collect his final pay and say goodby to those who were stuck on the line . It was most probable , and it awed him . Why had he never felt this way before about all his other jobs ? He found himself touching familiar objectsin an almost superstitious farewell  --  stacks of batteries , painted fenders swinging from hooks , glossy mufflers  --  as he made his way to the exit gate . He drove his old car up to the diner which stood on a bluff across the highway from the plant and took a place in an empty booth near the door , facing the TV screen . It was a combination bar and restaurant and was already filled with day men who had hurried in for a quick one on the way home to more sober affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee before going to work . " Will a steak take long ? " Harold asked the waitress . " You 'll have it before you know it . " " I do n't want it that fast . In point of fact , I want to look forward to it , medium rare . Coffee with it , and some tomato juice first . " While he sipped his juice , someone was flirting with the TV dial . The ball game had just ended and the search for something else had begun . At last they settled for a row of marching cigarettes ; the cigarettes went forward , stumbled , diminished , multiplied , pullulated , singing as they went . The screen was full of them , thousands of them , and theirp163piping voices grew louder and louder . Harold pulled out a pack of cigarettes , cursing himself for his susceptibility . His fingers were shaking so that he could hardly get one free of the pack . It was just that it raised the question of whether the rainbowroad to those daydreams was lined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch on as an animator or as whatever else you had to be to make it go nowadays . Letting the smoke simmer through his nostrils , Harold turned deliberately from the screen and gazed out the steamy window at the smooth , modern bulk of the factory glowing incandescently a quarter of a mile away . It looked like nothing so much as a splendid , progressive new prison , conceived and executed by an architect who knew how to use glass and aluminum to conceal concrete pillboxesand whirling searchlights ; at this moment he would not have been at all surprised to hear the wail of a siren announcing his escape . How did I stick it out so long , he marveled , how did I keep from going stir-crazy ? The answer was almost dreadfully clear . He knew it as soon as he admitted to himself that he was afraid to leave the factory , afraid to exchange its impersonal , endless subjectionfor the ministrations of the kindly keeper who waited for him with love and patience . On the line nothing was demanded of him beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent slave . That was all he needed to keep him sober . But now that he was leaving , he sensedp164with a chattering terror the demands that would be made on his poor wits when he would be expected to live by them and not by his brawn ; when he would be expected ( if only by himself ) to act like a man , and not like a bullock or a slave  --  or a drunk ; and he knew why it was that he used Marie  --  who loved him compassionately , as no one ever had before or would again  --  as a kind of city dump for everything that he feared and hated about his own aging self . She wanted him to be a free and independent man at last , with his own identity , but it could not be done unless she encircled him as a wedding ring encircles a finger . Was it a hopeless paradox ? Directly beneath his window , so close that he could practicallyjump down onto it if the window were open , like a cowboy making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combed , and snaffled for New York and Marie . Slowly he traced the number 40 on the steamed glass with his index finger , then rubbed it out . Through the cleared circle his car was zeroed in as if in a bull's-eye , its nose pointing toward his destination . The cigarettes had turned to snowflakes  --  magnified crystals like illustrations from the Book of Knowledge  --  through which a man and a woman were skating with crossed hands , singing cheerily of the washing wonders worked by soapflakes . Then the steak was before him , long , fat , and greasy on the heavy china platter . As he peered down at the globules of blood and fat skimming slowly like skaters over the nothingness of the gravy , Harold'sp165gorge rose . You 'll have to get it down , he told himself grimly , you 'll have to get it down . But how will I pay ? He patted his left hip ( no more razored-out pockets ) to ascertain whether the wallet Marie had sent him was in these trousers or out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out and glanced within : plenty . For the first time he felt a stiffness in one of the compartments . Curiously he worked his long , narrow finger insideand withdrew a small pasteboard . It was a plain blue -- and-white identification card , just what you usually find in new wallets . But Marie had made the wallet by hand . Why should she have put such a card inside ? Had she gone to the trouble just as a jocular reminder that the wallet was n't really machine-made ? Or . . . or what ? Harold peered at it a little more closely . There were spaces for his name , his address , his blood type . Then it said : In Case of Accident Please Notify . . . The card was trembling in his fingers . Furious with himself , he pushed away the steak platter and set down the card in its place , then reached into his jacket pocket for his fountain pen . As he was uncapping it , the waitress came back to his booth and said in a friendly fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's no good cold . " With a start , Harold nodded . " I will . Listen , bring me a double whisky , will you ? " The plump , plain girl looked at him in surprise . " Say , I never saw you drink before . Not even beer . "  | " You 're so right . I do n't drink . But I 've got a hard ride before I get back to the ranch . I may need one for the road . " When she returned with the whisky glass and a little scalloped paper napkin and a larger glass with ice water and swizzle stick , she demanded , " Mix it ? " Harold shook his head . " Listen , " she said nervously , " I know it 's none of my business , but maybe you should n't  --  " " Ah , " he broke in , " word gets around , does n't it ? I 'll tell you what . You just put it right down here , next to this little card . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about whether or not . " When she had done that , Harold picked up the fountain pen once again and began to cap and uncap it , cap and uncap it , waiting for the girl to go away and for the terrible deadly pangs in his insides to come to a tidal climax.  |p167OOKING  back on twenty-five years of factory life , Busterfelt reasonably proud that he had always supported his wife and daughter decently , and had worked up to becoming a foreman without acquiring the reputation of being either a climber or a schemer . He emphasized the soberness of his North German face in one way with a cigar , in another with the heavy-lensed eyeglasses that his increasing nearsightednessforced on him . When he thought how his once powerfulfather , crippled in an industrial accident , had wasted away uselessly in a wheel chair , a burden instead of a providerto his wife and children , Buster was inclined not so much to complain about having had to go to work at fourteen , as to be pleased with what he had achieved as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly line as ap168spot welder for sixteen years , through the depression and most of the war ; and when he put away his staff sergeant 's uniform and came home from Louisiana , he claimed his seniority , no longer with any great expectations but feeling that it was only prudent , especially with rising expenses and a daughter starting school . Within a year he became a foreman ; from time to time he was shifted from one line to another , but always it was made clear that his good qualities were appreciated , and there were even hints of better things to come . Buster liked being a boss . " Never mind that I wear clean clothes now , " he said to his wife one day . He held out his heavy hands to her across the kitchen table . " I worked for a long time and I 'm willing to work again if I have to . What feels good is that I 'm handling sixteen men because the company knows I know how to handle men . Not because I 'm harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union in the old days , or sucked around the bosses . The company knows where I stand and the men know where I stand . " He could not keep from adding , " There 's not many foremen can say that . " " I know , Carl , " his wife replied . Her mind was on the hem of her daughter 's dress that she was taking up . Lines were encircling Agnes 's throat like necklaces and embedding themselves forever , and the truth was that she did not want him to be too satisfied . Before it was too late , she wanted him to move up again . Buster was willing to make the effort , just as he was will/ing to recognize that the little things that went with being a boss gave him as much pleasure as his improved status gave his wife . After nine years of it , he still liked coming to work in a dirty place with clean clothes on and knowing that he was not going to get them dirty . And everything that went with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but dropping in early instead to the body shop office to sign in and sit around on a desk edge talking over productionproblems . Not having to eat out of a lunch box on the floor , or in the huge , prisonlike cafeteria with its long tables sprayed with spat-out grape pits , tipped-over sugar bowls , wet bread crusts expanding in pools of coffee , and cigarette butts put out in Jello , but at one of the quiet , clean tables in the supervisors ' wing of the cafeteria . Not having to change into overalls in the vaulted locker rooms smelling of tired men and tired feet , but hanging his hat and sport jacket in the foremen 's private locker room . And of course the money . Just as it was better to be the man who handed out the sixteen pay checks than to be one of the sixteen who received them , it was better to know that the check given you privately was a salary , plus overtimethat added up to a decent living . Naturally you paid a penalty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ; there was no recourse if they chose to knife you , and if you wanted the job bad enough you held still and let them stick it into you . But to Buster this was the way life was ; and if you were any good at handling sixteen workers , you ought to be pretty fair atp170handling sixteen bosses . After all these years the top brass knew him as well as they knew anyone at his level , and they did n't often chew him out as long as he pulled productionon his line . But then the company built an enormous new plant out in the sticks , and after the big move Buster found that his problems were not only multiplied but infinitely more complicated than he had ever thought possible . In the old factorythey had been building cars for over a quarter of a century . Everyone knew where everything was ; everybody knew everybody else  --  almost , anyway . Here , however , there was a solid year of trial and error , of sweating and cursing and hiring and firing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what it should have been ; even then the big wheels rolled in from Michigan and struck terror into the heart of every boss in the building . The basic trouble , as Buster was not alone in seeing , was that there was no longer a solid core of men who were used to building cars , knew what was involved in sweat and labor , and wanted the jobs bad enough to turn up in fair weather or foul , on time and ready to work a full day plus as much overtime as would be needed to hit the production quota . Absenteeism was fantastic  --  you were sure of havingenough men to keep the line rolling only on payday  --  and the turnover was something unbelievable unless you stood there and watched the faces come and go , come and go , in such numbers that you had to give up trying to learnp171their names because most of them would n't stay long enough to make it worth while bothering . " As soon as you try to get them to see just beyond their noses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the attitude you 're a company man . I pick up pieces of lead six and eight inches long that my solder flowers have thrown away because they ca n't be bothered flowing with a short stick , and I tell them the price of a hundred pounds of lead . . . and they laugh at me . I keep the sandpaper locked up according to instructions , and hand the boys out one piece at a time . They ask me why I 'm so stingy , they ask me if I 'm paying for it , and when I tell them that every single abrasive disc  --  the ones they toss around like kids with flyingsaucers  --  costs fifty cents , you know what they say ? " He took a gulp of coffee . " They say , So what . You ca n't even get them to see that their jobs depend on keeping costs down . Even if you could , I do n't think they 'd care . " Believe me , what the company did when they moved was to saddle us foremen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to pull more production than at the old plant with a bunch of guys that walk in not knowing one end of a screwdriver from the other , and are just as apt to walk out at the end of the day and never show up again . " Agnes raised her eyes briefly from the stocking whose toe she was mending . She said mechanically , " It 's a shame . " " It 's asking too much . You ca n't make a quality product with just a mob . That 's all you 've got is a mob , differentp172faces every day . " Buster put down his coffee cup with a clatter and took off his glasses to wipe off the steam that had arisen from it . " Damn it , sometimes I wish they 'd never built the new plant . We were all better off before . " Agnes smiled tolerantly . " Carl , you know that 's silly . If it had n't been for moving out to the country , we 'd never have bought this nice house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet refined boys and get away from the riffraff . " She added hastily , " And with you not having to go far to work . It 's worth putting up with some inconveniences when you think of the progress we 've made just in this year alone . That 's a sweet boy Jeanie 's out with tonight , you know ? A college boy . " " Inconveniences . What a word for the headaches I 've got . " Buster stood up and opened his belt . " Going to bed , Aggie . Sorry I ca n't wait up with you , but I 'm beat . " For the first time , Agnes was stirred . She put down the stocking and raised her face for his kiss . " I feel bad for you , Carl . But it ca n't get worse , it has to get better . And if I was you I would n't let the company forget what I 've been doing for them . " Buster smiled grimly to himself on the way to work the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all these years , she still did n't know the facts of life ; it was lucky , he thought , that he 'd taken her out of the beauty shop and insisted on her being a housewife . When his men started coming in , he gave them each a hello as they ambled up from the time clock , opened theirp173toolboxes and put on their aprons . It was always his policy to say hello and good-by to his men no matter how grumpy he or they felt . He wanted them to like him and respect him , not to fear or mistrust him . There were a few who understood , he was sure  --  men like Harold , the drunken artist , and old Pop , the inspector who had been around for a thousand years , and probably Orrin , his one good metal finisher , who was doubtless going to be made a boss one of these days ; but they were a tiny minority . For the rest you had to keep the line going with men who  --  even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them sweat . " Here , " he would say to a new man standing around with his file dangling from his hand , trying to look interested , " let me show you how to use that . Guide it with your left hand . Keep your thumb and forefinger spread across the back of the file , and then just let it glide back and forth , like this . Do n't rub , do n't grip too hard . You know why ? " he would smile at the awkward , nervous man . " Because this file can wear you down quicker than it can wear down the metal . Take it slow , easy and steady , remember to guide it , not force it , and you 'll do fine . " The responses were varied , but Buster held to the patient approach , treating the newcomers , he explained , as he would have wanted to be treated himself . There were times when he lost his temper , mostly when the pressure was on and Hawks the body shop supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would yellp174and chew a man out for the work he 'd left undone or the job he 'd botched . Usually , however , he tried to stick to persuasion . " Now look at that , " he would say sadly , pointing to a low spot on a job one of his men had walked away from . " Would you buy that car ? " Or , when Hawks put the heat on him to have the men identify their work , he would pass among them with a box of chalk . " Do n't make me tell you again , " he would complainin as low a voice as possible . " They want to know which jobs are which . If you do n't put your initials on every job you do , you 'll wind up with a reprimand . " It seemed to him that the men on the line , even those who came and went like ghosts , must know that he was doing his best both to pull production and to cover for them , even when he screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buster is the best boss in the shop . " He had heard it with his own ears ; he knew the word got around , and he knew that it was true . He had constantly to be teaching these new men how to metal-finish , and as soon as one was well broken in , he would quit . That made no difference to the production men , who expected you to turn out forty units an hour if you had to do it singlehanded . And to top it off the job-study engineers began to make tests on his line . They tried havinghis metal finishers do every fourth job instead of every third , but do the entire side instead of only the rear quarter/panel . This freed the metal finishers who had been specializing in front doors for other work , but it left Buster holding a bagful of complaints from men who did n't like to work in the first place and now felt that they had been tricked and overburdened . All he could say was that experiments were being made to expedite the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do more than he was capable of doing . But since most of the men were new and probationary employees , they could not bitch to the union . Buster did what he could . " I guess you do n't believe it , " he would say to a boy like Walter , who filed his heart out but still did miserable work , " but I used to work myself . Put in sixteen years before they made me a boss , so I know how the workingman feels . Here , let me show you that , if I can . " And as Walter wiped his sweaty forehead on his sleeve , Buster took up the file , buried his arm in the trunk , and reached far forward to tap at the difficult dent , cheeringthe boy along as he showed him how to do it . " I know exactly how it feels to have the damn things keep coming one after the other . Sometimes you wish the line would break down , right ? What a wonderful feeling when you look back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one you 're finishing and the next one ! " And he laughed to see the boy flush guiltily . But then the engineers decided to shake up yet another operation . Two men put the cast-iron hooks and chains on the cars on Buster 's line : one hooked up the front ends , the other the back , so that each car could be swung intop176the air at the end of the line and floated into the bonderizingbooth to be rust-proofed . These two men also fitted on the lighter hooks on which the doors were hung for both station wagons and panel trucks . Since their work was heavy ( the hooks and chains weighed about twenty pounds apiece ) but so unskilled that it could be learned in two minutes by anyone with two hands and a strong back , there was a tremendous turnover on the job . Already Busterhad had a crazy Negro who sang at the top of his lungs , an Irishman just in from the old country , several big , sad , stupid men , and a number of crafty kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any work at all if they could help it . The ones who quit , quit ; from among the others Buster picked out those who seemed to have some sense and set them to work learning metal-finishing , which paid fifteen cents an hour more than the crude work they were doing . Always he knew , though , that the hook men were the easiest to replace . Now , however , the experts decided that the smaller hooks could be installed at the very beginning of the line by the man who gunned the door plates and had been clocked as having time to spare . This left only the big chains and hooks to be attached . It was the engineers ' opinion that this could be done by one man instead of two if he would pick up one hook with each hand and mount the line between two jobs , doing first the back of one car , then the front of the car directly behind it on the line . They explained it to Buster before the day 's siren blew ,  |p177hitching  up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to shut off his complaints . He said formally , " Those hooks get heavy . " " We 've weighed them . They 're well within the  --  " " The point is that they get heavier as the day goes along . Especially if you ask a man to climb up and down with one in each hand . They 're used to resting them against the stomach . You ca n't do that if you have to pick up two at a time . " " Let 's try it , " the little time-and-motion man said with finality . He raised his voice as the starting siren went off . " Where 's your hook man ? " " I have n't got any yet . They took them both off to work in the duck pond yesterday . Horton is going to bring me a couple replacements from the employment office in a little while . Any minute . " They glanced at their stop watches . " We 'll be back . " Then Horton , the production man , five years younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineeringdegree and also , Buster was convinced , because he was a Mason like all the big wheels , came hustling up on his wiry bowlegs , towing along two new men , one old , one young . They stood at one side , new toolboxes in their hands , trying to look unconcerned as Horton spoke to Buster . " Here 's your men . You 're only supposed to have one on the hooks . " " I know . "  | " Use the young kid for it . He 's stronger . " Buster suppressed his anger . What kind of moron did Horton take him for ? " Besides , " Horton finished , " the old boy 's experienced . You wo n't hardly have to break him in . " He lifted his hand abruptly in farewell and took off , humming as he bummed a ride on a passing engineer 's bike . Buster wheeled to examine the two men and discovered that the old boy , puffy and paunchy in his turned-up new dungarees , was staring at him with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Say , " Buster said tentatively , " do n't I  --  " " It 's Frank , Buster . Frank 's the name . I used to metalfinishwhen you were spot-welding , remember ? It 's been twenty years . " " Well , I 'll be damned . " They shook hands . Clasping the older man 's soft , tired hand , Buster found himself wondering why a man his age had to come back to work here after all these years . A littleembarrassed , he said , " Welcome back . " " Thanks . I see a lot of faces  --  " " Excuse me . The line 's starting up , and I 've got to get this other fellow going on the hooks . Start filing on the doors with that guy in the railroad cap , will you ? " Buster turned to the glum youngster , who looked as though his mother had sent him off to work against his will . " Okay , put your gloves on , fellow , and I 'll show you what I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian , with glittering black hair that he wore very long , completely covering the tops of his ears and meeting in back in what Buster had heard described as a duck's-ass haircut . His complexion was very white and bloodless , and the back of his neck above his shirt collar was pitted with deep , black-centered acne scars . Buster was a good Catholic and believed devoutly in not judging his fellow man by background or nationality , but he could not help thinking that this one looked like those neighborhood gang-warriors that you read about in the magazines ; it would n't be surprising if he carried a six-inch switch-blade knife . The boy observed Buster coldly , saying nothing , only muttering and nodding his head when Buster asked if he understood the work . After a few minutes the boy seemed to have caught on and Buster left him . He returned to Frank for a moment , faced with the problem of explaining that it would be impossible to stand around reminiscing about the old days . It was not easy to do this without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Buster found that he was starting to sweat . He told Frank to keep at it , to help him show the youngsters how you could work steady without killing yourself , and he moved on . The next time he had a chance to look over the line and see how things were going  --  it must have been an hour later - he saw the Italian boy all the way up the line near the platform , twenty feet past where he should have beenp180working . He was running sweat , and his oiled hair was fallingover his ears . As Buster approached , he jerked his head angrily . " How 's it going ? " Buster asked . " I ai n't Superman , Mac , " the boy snarled , as he flung an iron chain into the rear of a station wagon with a crash . " You can call me Buster . I 'll help you get caught up . " Buster half-trotted back to the head-high stack of hooks and chains that sat on a dolly at the middle of the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been and hopped up onto the line . Crisscrossing each other , he and the boy had soon worked their way back to the center of the line . " There you go , " Buster said . He glanced down at the figured cotton sport shirt that Agnes had given him for his birthday  --  it was scored with red primer and dotted at the chest with droplets of sweat that had soaked through his undershirt . " Let 's try to keep caught up , okay ? " " Christ , " the boy said , and unloosed a torrent of obscene abuse on the factory and the entire auto industry . " I come in here to make a living , not to kill myself . " If the boy had looked and talked a bit differently , Buster would not only have sympathized with him , but would have tried to do something to lighten his load . As it was , he felt that the boy was swearing at him but did n't have the courage to do it directly . In the circumstances it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a guinea pig.  | " Do the best you can , " he said coldly . " You 're entitled to twelve minutes ' rest period before lunch . I 'll check with the relief man to make sure you get your break . " " If I live that long , " the boy replied . Buster turned his back on him and sought out the relief man , who was doing Orrin 's work . " When Orrin comes back , " he said , " get the new kid that 's on the hooks . I do n't want him griping that he did n't get his relief . " " When ! When ! How do I know when ? " cried the relief man angrily . " Orrin cut his hand , he went to the hospital . He may be gone an hour . You want me to walk off his job here to make that kid happy ? " " Do n't talk foolish . Stick with it , I 'll see what I can do . " " You better not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he bent to his work . " Better worry about all the guys that 'll be on your neck for their relief if Orrin does n't get back soon . " What the line needed , of course , was a utility man in addition to a relief man for just such situations , a good allaroundman who could be slipped into any vacant slot in case of emergency . But the wheels would n't authorize the extra name on the payroll ; they insisted that it was part of Buster 's job to train up his men to cut down on accidents and minimize emergency situations . Buster would just as soon have pitched in and given his men their relief himself , but it was against the union contractfor a boss to touch a tool . He was uneasily aware thatp182somebody with a grudge might be small enough to turn him in for working , even though he was getting a relief that he would not otherwise have had . Or maybe Lou the union committeeman would come by and cite him for the violation . Lou was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and make himself a big shot for the next election . Buster decided to circulate among his men . " We 're in a jam , " he said . " Orrin 's stuck in the hospital and I do n't think you 're going to get any relief this morning . " " No relief ! " one shouted . " With them running forty-five jobs an hour at us ! What the hell 's going on here ? If nobody'sgoing to get his relief , shut the line down for twelve minutes and we 'll all take it together . " " Let 's be reasonable . You know I ca n't do anything like that . I 'll see that you make it up . Maybe after lunch . " His men were not only working at a hard , steady pace themselves , but whenever they had a chance they lent a hand to the new man , handing him hooks and chains from the pile , sometimes doing a job themselves . One of them complained bitterly , " That new kid ca n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going this fast . Not even with our help . " It was true . The boy was sweating furiously , trotting , lifting , cursing steadily . One of the tails of his gaudy shirt had worked up in back and hung free over his trousers , which were , Buster now noticed , an old pair of dress pants cut in zoot style , billowing at the thigh and so tight at thep183cuff that his ankles seemed bound with bicycle clips . For some reason these draggy pants , which would have been at home in a candy store or a cheap saloon , not here where men were busy working hard , infuriated Buster . Still , he knew that he was being unfair , and he stepped back out into the aisle to see if he could spot the two engineers . Once they saw that they had miscalculated , he would be able to ask for another man . But they were nowhere in sight . Naturally . He swore to himself and hurried back to the boy , who raised his head and yelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two of the men on the line looked up and laughed . There was no question about whose side they were on , and it made Buster feel as though in some subtle , indefinable way they were betraying him by siding with such a punk . Nevertheless , he grasped one of the elephant-tusk hooks and was preparing to help the boy to catch up once again when he heard his name being called . He looked up and saw Hawks standing fifty feet ahead , one hand hooked in the fancy woven belt which he claimed a lady friend had given him , the other hand waving imperiously for Buster to hurry . Above his brilliant tie of stars , planets , and asteroids whirling dizzily against the white universe of his shirt , his mournful , hangdog face was set for unpleasantness . Another one of those Masons , Buster thought angrily as he stomped toward him . With no preamble the supervisor swung out his ringed hand and rapped it sharply against thep184taillight hole of a car swaying in the air between him and Buster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , " he said . " See if you can get your boys to understand that we 've got to meet competition . Jobs like this one here ca n't go through . " It was true . There was an unchalked dent down low , belowthe taillight ; but since it had slipped by Pop the inspectorit was understandable that it should have been missed . Buster looked at the front of the job : it bore Orrin 's initials . He put two fingers to his mouth and whistled up the relief man who was doing Orrin 's work . With deliberate slowness the relief man straightened up from his job and slouched forward to meet him . " Listen , Buster , " he said flatly , ignoring the supervisor , who did not move but simply turned his back on them , " they 're coming fast , and I got a lot of work . Ca n't your pick-up men take care of the little things we miss ? " " This is n't little . " Buster pointed to the dent with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let a job like this go by . You 're getting a dime an hour extra for being a relief man . You want to keep on getting that dime , you better do the work right . Come on , clean it up and get back to your place . " The relief man flashed him a look of pure hatred . But he said nothing , instead dropped to one knee , inserted his arm with the file inside the taillight hole , and began to rap rhythmically at the dent . Buster stood watching him forp185a moment . He could think of nothing to say that would take the sting out of what he had just said , and so at last he turned to Hawks . " I 'm shorthanded today , " he said to the supervisor , " and they 're trying to make the hooks a one-man job , and  --  " " Shorthanded ? Did n't they give you two new men ? I saw the schedule sheet myself . " " Yes , but one is going to metal-finish . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is breaking his hump . He just ca n't keep up . " " I know you like to stick up for your men . " Hawks pulled a pendulous earlobe and stared at him sadly . " That 's fine . Now try sticking up for me a little . I 've got to turn out three hundred and fifty units before the night shift comes on . Think about that . Next time you see Horton , give him your complaint . " Thus dismissed , Buster returned to the line , grabbed a hook , and hopped up to give the new boy a hand . The boy was a mess . He had not put on an apron , and his front was splotched with red primer dust . His face was blotched with red , and with hatred and self-pity , and he muttered to himself unceasingly as he strove . My God , Buster thought , a crazy colored singer , a crazy Irish schoolteacher , a dozen assorted morons , and now a teen-age bum . " Tell you something , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the moving line , working together . " I know what it is to work . Do n't think I do n't sympathize with you.  |p186I  used to work . I worked for sixteen years before they made me a boss . And I had plenty of rough days like you 're having now . It 's all part of the game . " " Sixteen years , " the boy sneered incredulously . " You must have been some quick thinker . " Buster clamped his jaws shut tight . He jumped off the line and lifted up another hook . Panting a little now , he said , " Jobs were n't as easy to come by in those days as they are now . If you made a living you were grateful , and you hung on . " " Times have changed . " " They sure have , " Buster said . " But I have n't . I started working when I was fourteen , and I worked too long and too hard to forget what it 's like . That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the fact that I 've been a boss for nine years . " " Who did you get to know after those sixteen years ? " the boy asked insolently . " Or did you just wait for somebody to die off ? " Buster bit hard on his cigar . " You want to get anyplace in this world , " he said coldly , " you better learn to smarten up . The boy laughed as he flung back his long black hair . " I was born smarter , " he replied , " than some of the charactersaround this dump . " Shortly after that , the man gunning the door plates ran out of screws ; then an air hose broke and whirled lethally through the air , hissing and twirling madly like a crazedp187snake ; one thing followed another , and Buster had no more chance to help the new boy . Once he glanced up and saw that although the boy was again so far behind that he was running from one end of the fast-moving line to the other , staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men , furious at being cheated out of their relief and at the way the boy was being treated , were giving him a hand whenever they could spare a few seconds . Finally Orrin came back from the hospital , and the relief man was freed to give some rest to at least a few of the men . When the siren blew for lunch , Buster had no appetite . He bought a bowl of stew and a cup of coffee and sat down at his customary place with the foreman from the grinding booth and Halstein , boss inspector . The grinding booth foreman looked at him sympathetically . " Tough day today , Buster ' ? " he demanded between gulps of soup . Buster opened his mouth to tell them and then thought better of it . He crumbled a cracker into the stew and shrugged . " The usual . " Then Halstein , who Buster suspected stood in well with the Masonic clique , started to talk about a three-dimensionalkite his boy had built , and Buster hardly listened . His eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of the cafeteria like a ghost . At last Buster spotted him , two minutes before they had to return . He hastened over to him . " You fellows changed that operation into a one-man deal3p188on my line , " he said quickly , " but you never came around to check on it . " " Tied up , " the little engineer said tersely . " Now look , it 's just too much for one man . I 'm shorthandedas it is . I told you before  --  " " We 'll get to you this afternoon . Keep your shirt on . " How could Agnes or anyone on the outside know how it was to be caught in the middle between zoot-suiters and college hot shots ? Sometimes , he thought , the advantages did n't outweigh the headaches , not at all ; and he could understand the men who had turned down chances to be made foremen , or who had given up foremen 's jobs and returned to production , where they were covered by the union and had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where all they had to do was wear uniformsand look important . At his desk he lit a fresh cigar and , as the line started to roll once again , busied himself with the attendance sheets that had to be cleaned up . He had been at it for perhaps ten minutes and was just about finished when something , some instinctive feeling that all was not right , made him swivel about and stare . For a moment everything looked normal . The line was going at a fairly fast clip and his men , their stomachs full , were working hard and steady . Then he realized what was wrong . None of the cars , not one of them , had any hooks on it  --  and the new boy was nowhere in sight . His heart hammering , Buster leaped forward and took the nearest man by the arm.  | " Where 's that hook man ? The new one ? " The metal finisher had an odd glint in his eye . " I have n't seen him since lunch . " " Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face stiffen , " Never mind . Run down there and tell the relief man to come up here . " Without waiting , Buster grabbed two hooks and hurled them onto the station wagons before which he had been standing . If he did not get caught up within a very few minutes , the cars reaching the head of the line without hooks would not be able to swing off ; they would pile up , and the entire line would have to be stopped . And it was on his neck . Blindly , cursing the missing boy , Buster flung himself at the hooks and fastened them to the cars , bending over double in his haste . The blood rushed to his head and the vein in his left temple began to pound . He finished two jobs and ran headlong back to the stack of hooks for two more , his key ring falling from his pocket as he ran . " What 's on your mind , Buster ? " the relief man asked him coolly . Without pausing , Buster said over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , until I can find that son of a  --  " " I 'm not going to hang hooks all afternoon . I 'm not paid for that . I 'm not even supposed to relieve the hook man and you know it . " " It 's not for all day . Just till that guy turns up . "  | " I doubt that he will . Somebody heard him say he was pulling out . " " What ! " " Sorry , Buster . " The relief man 's small eyes glittered maliciously . " Most of your men got no relief this morning . I ca n't gyp them out of it this afternoon too just because this kid took off . " He sauntered away . Buster did not dare to stop to hunt for help . As he passed another of his men kneeling with his file , he cried out , " Where 's the new guy ? " And this man , too , grinned . " I hear he did n't even punch out . Just hit the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffly onto the line with the two hooks and tried to considerhow he could get word to supervision that he needed help quickly . A glance up and down showed no one in sight . His own men looked as though they could hardly keep their faces straight . " I would n't mind , " he said to the man kneeling below him , " if he 'd only told me . " He tried to keep his voice casual . " It 's a free country . Nobody can make you work if you do n't want to . But to sneak out without letting anybodyknow . . . " " It just shows you , " the crouching man yelled up at him . " Even a crummy job like that , a job nobody wants and any dope can do , you got to treat a man right to do it right or you ca n't build cars . " " You 're not telling me anything I do n't know , " Busterp191cried angrily , as he straightened his back and scrambled off the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like I try to play square with  --  " At that instant a booming crash rang out over all the other noises of the body shop . Everyone looked up at once , bewildered . The crash was followed by a horrible sound of rending metal . Then Buster knew what had happened . He was petrified inside with the positive knowledge that more was to follow ; his tongue was frozen into silence ; but his body continued to move automatically . Yes , it came again , another crash like the first , followed by more rhythmic thuds , until everyone on the line realized what was happening . The Italian boy had taken his vengeance before running away . He had attached the hooks and chains of his last few jobs lopsidedly , in some cases only fastening one side , so that now , an hour after he had escaped , the cars tilted as they entered the narrow bonderizing booth , and , hanging off balance , crashed back and forth , back and forth , against the sides of the booth , metal smashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . When the third car had begun to rocket back and forth in the booth , Buster , the sweat streaming down his cheeks , saw Hawks and Horton and two other white-shirted executivesfrom quality control running down the aisle and clambering up the catwalk to the little metal door in the center of the bonderizing booth . Then a battery-powered scooter rolled up and the assistant plant superintendent hopped off , followed by three overalled maintenance men.  |p192Now  that it was too late , the reinforcements had arrived . Up and down the line his men , looking like strangers , were openly grinning . With every booming thud , every tearing sound , their grins grew wider . They did n't care that hundreds of dollars in time and labor were going down the drain ; it amused them . They did n't care that the smashed hulks would have to be hauled out of the booth and dragged to a corner ; they were already calculating the overtime they would earn repairing these wrecks . They did n't care that he was still hanging hooks , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unable to summon help from the bosses , who now had something more important to keep them occupied . They thought he had it coming , and Buster , his heart wrenched in his chest , stared at their grinning faces and wondered how it could be that people who worked together could have so little human feeling . Do n't they know I could n't help it ? he asked himself . " Hey , Buster ! " one of them called out . " Some symphony , eh ? " " Laugh , " he replied grimly . " We may all get laid off for this . " " Say , Buster  --  how does it feel to work like a dog ? Does it take you back to the old days ? The good old days ? " Tossing a heavy hook contemptuously into the rear of a station wagon , he faced them out and said coolly , around his cigar , " I 've worked harder , in my time . I never asked one man , never in my life , to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rancid in his gummy mouth , but it was a visible proof that he had not capitulated , that he was simply handling a passing crisis ; so he refused to throw it away , or even to take it out of his mouth while he worked . But he could not prevent the sweat from pouring down his body , from forming huge , dark , telltale moons under the armpits of his sport shirt , from plastering the front of the shirt to his chest , from soaking through his slacks at the base of his spine , from dripping down his forehead onto the rims of his glasses , smudging and steaming the lenses . He hated to do it , but , half-blinded by his own sweat , he had to take off the glasses and stuff them into his shirt pocket . In a way it was worse than giving up the cigar would have been . Without the glasses he felt naked and exposed , and he knew that his face took on a stupid , blinking expression when his nearsighted eyes tried to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel trucks someone had scrawled in huge letters , no doubt with the chalk that he himself hadhanded out , TOO MANY CHIEFS , NOT ENOUGH INDIANS ! " I bet you 'll sleep good tonight , eh , Buster ? " somebody asked as he hurried off the line to lift up a hook . " A little hard work never killed anybody , " he muttered around his dead cigar . But his groin was tight as a drumhead , and every step counted off every month of his fortyfiveyears . " Wait 'll we get the union after you , Buster ! " someone called out.  |p194He  whirled about but could not see who had said it ; they all had their heads down . There was n't one of them would complain to their committeeman , not because they feared reprisals , but because this show was too good to put an end to . Oh , they 'd have something to talk about all the way home , and even after they got home  --  how the boss had been humiliated and made to work like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ; I 'll turn in my time and ask for a transfer ; I can make my living without having to take this . Glancing down at the red primer dust which covered him , he could already hear his wife 's voice added to all the rest . " Kind of rough , hey , Buster ? " It was Orrin , the only man on the line with a perfect attendance record ; the only one who really liked hard work and hard pressure . " They wo n't hold you responsible . It was n't your fault that young jerk ducked out . " Buster mumbled a reply . He was unsure whether these first words of sympathy he 'd had all day were sincere or whether Orrin , having gotten wind of his possible promotion , was starting to suck around . Old Frank , who had been doing a great job of making himself inconspicuous , now sidled up to him , encouraged maybe by what Orrin had just said . He cleared his throat and spat into the lead filings . " Say listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spell you on that job ? I 'm not doing too much metal-finishing. "  | " That 's all right , Frank . Just stick at what you 're doing , I want you to get the feel of it again . " " But I 'll tell you frankly , I did n't think I 'd get back in here at my age , and I 'd like to show my appreciation , so if you 'd let me  --  " " No , no , that 's all right , thanks . You get days like this , and you just have to learn to live with them . " Fortunately at that moment Horton and the qualitycontrolman came over from the bonderizing booth , and Frank had to do a fade-out . They seemed to think the scene was pretty funny , too , and they stood there , grinning , watching him sweat . " You certainly must have browbeat that kid to make him walk out after four hours , " Horton said . " Man , what a slave driver . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra labor cost on those four banged-up jobs , " the quality-control man said . " Very funny , " Buster snarled . " Are you going to get me a man for this job or not ? " The quality-control man turned to Horton . " Did n't you hear them say Buster was going to have to work it off until he 'd made up for his sins ? " " All right , all right , " Horton said , smiling at his Masonic buddy , then turning to Buster . " Come on down off that line , they 're getting you a replacement . You look like hell if I may say so , like Before in the Before and After ads . " It was true . Buster stared at himself in the washroomp196mirror when he had gone in to clean up for a minute , after they 'd provided him with another man to finish out the day . He looked like Before , but he felt like After , long After . And what would you do if you threw it over ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That nameless herd who came and went like stockyard cattle ? That clique of Masons who boosted each other and each other 's relatives into all the key jobs , and would maybe one day make him an assistantsupervisor , or a foreman over the body shop foremen , just to satisfy the Michigan crowd that they were bringing up men from the ranks ? When the day was over at last , he sat down for a while in the body shop office and went over with Hawks and several others the series of events that had been so costly to him and to production , but would n't even rate a footnote in the history of the corporation . They gave him to understand that it was a closed issue , dead and forgotten , if he would see to it in the future that such things would n't happen again . Weary and pensive , he got in his car and crawled home to the new development where his house stood on an artificially winding black-top road , in the middle of what had been a potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway he caught sight of his wife outside the kitchen door , hanging the laundry on the aluminum and nyloncorddryer that he 'd mounted in concrete for her , a temporary expedient which would have to be replaced one day soon by an automatic dryer.  |p197She  looked pretty , her arms raised against the twilight , her shy lips puckered with clothespins , her skirt whipping free  --  younger and slimmer than she really was . She waved at him , and he waved back , but he was too tired to talk or to kiss her , and he went directly into the house and drew himself a tub . Flat on his back with the water still bubbling at his ankles , he found himself thinking of old Frank . That was probably the most important thing that had happened during the day  --  Frank 's showing up after twenty years , ready and willing to take up a job that was n't good enough for that teen-age gangster . But when Agnes asked him  --  as she would  --  what had happened at the shop , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would say that it was a shame , a man of fifty-six having to start in all over , and of course that was true ; she would wonder what had happened after all these years to make him come back to the shop , and that was something to wonder about , it was true ; but she would also end by gloating a little and by pointing out the contrast and the fact that Buster might still move up yet another notch or two if his luck held . And that he was n't ready to say at all . Because no one could know ; there were things you could n't say and things you should n't say ; and maybe at that moment when Frank had offered to help out he was in a stronger position than Buster himself . . . even though it was also true that the very sight of him with his old belly and his new work pants was enough to drive out of Buster'sp198mind any serious thought of giving up his foreman 's job . He sighed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the running water : " Everything all right , Carl ? " " Yes . " " Have a hard day ? " " I had a lousy day . " " What ? What did you say ? " He turned up the water and splashed a bit so as not to have to answer , and his wife went on . " We 've got to talk about that summer bungalow before Jeanie gets home , because I 've got to mail in the deposit tonight . I 've been thinking  --  can you hear me , Carl ?  --  it might be worth while to invest in one in a better location where there 's a better class of boys . I know you 've got your heart set on that boat , but maybe if we took the boat money and put it toward the bungalow , it would pay off as far as Jeanie 's concerned , and maybe next summer if you get a promotion we can think about that boat again . . . " He closed his eyes , took his nose by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . When he came up his wife had stopped talking , and he stepped from the tub , cleaner at least , to prepare himself for dinner and the evening.  |p199Back  in the Saddle AgainAS RECENTLY as a decade ago , ' it says , a man of sixtyfivewas considered old . Now , as increasing medical knowledge and an ever-higher standard of living push back the frontiers of age , we  --  ' " " Oh please , May . " Her husband raised his hands wearily from the solitaire game spread out before him . " I know all that by heart . " " I did n't mean to break up your train of thought . " " It 's not that . " He looked at his wife , short , squat , warmbosomed , smiling anxiously behind the gleaming bifocals , her two-strap shoes planted firmly on the carpet ; she seemed to be growing out of the couch like a mushroom . He sighed . I 'm fat myself , he thought ; but after thirty-three years May still thinks of us as honeymooners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , then what 's somebody likep200me ? A kid of fifty-six . That 's what you 're getting at , is n't it ? " " Do n't poke fun at me , Frank . I just ca n't stand to see you down in the dumps . " Frank found himself longing to turn on the television . There was nothing he wanted to see ; there was nothing he had against his wife 's talking . It was simply that , sitting here in their son 's parlor and minding the grandchildren , they had come to the end of the road . The business was shot , the bills were overdue , and the account was overdrawn . They both knew and dreaded what came next , but while May was still game for dream-answers , Frank wanted only to drown himself in the television . " Do n't you want to talk , Frank ? Because if you do n't , I wo n't disturb you any more . " May was fairly shrewd . The boys were sleeping soundly , and she knew that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife came home . Besides , Ray would probably have his cousin Wilbur with him  --  everything hinged on Wilbur . Frank scooped up the cards , smoothed them out , and slipped them into their case . " All right , " he said to his wife , folding his hands on the card table and looking at her steadily . " What it comes down to is that you think I 've quit and that I think it 's time to face reality . I 'm just not young enough to gamble other people 's money on new business deals . You ca n't talk me into feeling different just because you do n't want me to go back to the factory . "  | " But that 's what I do n't understand . If you 're too worn out for business , how are you going to be able to take the assembly line ? " " Here 's where I 'm tired . " He touched his temple with his fingertip . " I ca n't take any more lickings in business , May . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the factory , union or no union , labor or no labor . Is n't that clear by now ? " " But the drive-ins , " she said desperately . " You said yourselfthey 're the coming thing in the picture business . " " They 're out of my class . I can handle popcorn stands in neighborhood movies , but drive-ins ? It takes dough to make dough , and I have n't got the nerve to borrow any more . Besides . . . " He hesitated . " Who 'd lend me the money ? " The silence was painful . May knew the answer as well as he . Her family had loaned Frank the equity price of the appliancefranchise twenty years ago , and on the strength of it he had quit the factory . He had learned how to reduce an inventorybut not how to handle money , so he was caught and slowly drained out in the credit squeeze . It had taken him a long time and some painful side lines ( door-to-door sellingof tableware was one ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , first from his own family , then from the bank as he prospered , to go into the candy concession business . Right through the war he did fine . But when it ended , instead of pulling in his horns he had expanded , buying into an entire chain just in time for the collapse ofp202the movie industry . He had become a little tycoon in town , a real chain operator , and before his eyes the chain rusted away , eating up with it his capital and most of his life savings . Even if money were n't tight now , the banks would n't give him a break , not after his big miscalculation . There was only one source left . A bolder man might have done it , might have gone to his children and his nephews , to the young ones who were on the way up and had a little put aside , and asked them for a stake . The killing was there to be made , May was right , if you were bold ; but he was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You still did n't answer me , how you 're going to be able to work on the assembly line again after twenty years . It 's not like standing behind a candy counter . I 'll never forget what you went through , those eleven years in the factory . You got old before your time . How long do you think you 'll last this time ? " " Conditions are different now , " he replied with false heartiness . " They got civilized , these last twenty years . If you do n't believe me , ask Wilbur . He 's in Personnel , it 's true , but he 's in and out of the shop ten times a day . Besides . . . what alternative have I got ? " The look in May 's eyes was terrible , so terrible that neither of them could bear it , and after an instant they both lowered their eyes in confusion , like two strangers who bump on a sidewalk and then veer away from one another . Then , thank God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Jerry , " May murmured . " Let me take care of him , " Frank said eagerly . " Bring him a glass of water . Maybe he only wants to be covered , but take the water just in case . " Puffing a little , Frank approached the crib of his fouryear-oldgrandson . The little boy had quieted at his approachand sat waiting in the dark . " Want a drink of water , Jerry ? " Jerry did not speak , but instead nodded with such vigor that his blond curls fell forward across his forehead . Achingwith love , Frank bent down and handed him the glass , holding on so that it would not spill . His fingers met his grandson 's and enfolded them until the glass was empty . " Now cover me good . " Even as he spoke , the boy fell back asleep . Frank was tiptoeing out of the room when Jerry 's older brother startled him by speaking in a conversational voice . " Say , Grandpa , would you tuck me in too ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed of his eight-year-old grandson . " You do n't want Jerry to wake up again , do you ? " Donnie 's black eyes glittered happily , catching the reflection of the dim hall light . " Do n't worry about him . He even drinks that water in his sleep . But he 's cute , is n't he ? " Frank 's heart turned over . He dropped to one knee to arrange the dark-haired boy 's covers . " Going to give me a kiss ? "  |p204Donnie  flung his arms around his neck and whispered , " What are you and Grandma doing inside ? " " Just talking . " " I know , I heard you . But what about ? " Frank sought words . " About what I 'm going to do . I may take a position in the automobile plant where your Uncle Wilbur works . I used to work there many , many years ago , before you were born . " " Are you going to do what Uncle Wilbur does ? " " No . . . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come and visit you ? " " We 'll see , " he responded automatically . He smoothed the boy 's fine dark hair back from his forehead . " Now go to sleep . " May glanced up from her paper as he entered the living room . " Everything all right ? " " Sure . " He sat down next to her on the sofa . It was one of those modern ones , so close to the ground that his knees seemed to come up toward his jaw . " May , do n't be upset . You know I 'm just trying to be practical . It is n't even sure that Wilbur can get me in , they seldom take men over thirty-five these days . " " Well , I hope they do n't . " Her face was set . " You think it means nothing to me , what you went through with all those low-class people when they were organizing the union  --  those beatings , fights , cars being tipped over . I 'll never forget how you hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't remember me any more . All that businessp205is settled now . " How he wished he could believe what he was saying ! " Let me worry about that . The point is , you ca n't laugh off the security . I 've got ten years left to build up my Social Security . Now Wilbur thinks those eleven years I put in will count towards my retirement rights . You realize what that means ? In ten years I 'll be able to quit for good . We would n't have much , but we could get by withoutbeing dependent . As it is now . . . " May folded the paper and put it between them . " I want you to promise me one thing , " she said . " Just one thing . " He rubbed his bald head and squinted at her warily . " What ? " " Promise me that if it gets too hard you 'll quit . It is n't worth it  --  to wear yourself out and get mixed up in union fights for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He nodded silently . May reached for his hand . Glancing down in surprise , he saw her pudgy little fingers with the two rings disappearinginto his own . " Those little kids are beautiful , you know ? " he asked after a while . " Look who they take after ! " May laughed . They were sitting companionably over May 's crossword puzzle when Ray and his cousin Wilbur came in with their wives . " Well ! Good evening , Lovebirds , " Ray said amiably , as he helped the women off with their coats . " The kids give you any trouble , Dad ? "  | " They never stirred . " Frank arose and knocked out his pipe . " Wilbur , May and I have been talking it over , and we 've decided to go ahead with the factory idea  --  if you still think you can swing it . " The younger people were elaborately casual . Frank knew at once that they too had just been speaking of his situation . It hurt . Which was worse  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his father or the father who knew what he was doing to his boy ? Ray had nothing to offer his father but sympathy  --  and even that , Frank knew , he dared not express but had instead to pretend that it meant nothing to him  --  or even that he was pleased  --  that his father was going to wind up as he had started , an overalled factory worker . As for Wilbur , Frank 's late brother 's only child , he had two alternatives , neither of them pleasant . He could gamble one last time on his uncle by loaning him all the money he had , or he could plead with the plant to make an exception and take on a man of fifty-six because he was a deserving relative . As soon as he began to speak , smiling softly and smoothing down his rain-soaked moustaches , Frank knew which of the unpleasant courses Wilbur preferred . " Of course I can , Uncle . Why do n't you come in about ten tomorrow ? That 'll give me an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for you . " He was very decentabout it ; he made it seem as if it was nothing at all , when in fact Frank realized perfectly well that it was going to be an extremely embarrassing thing for him to pull off ,  |p207bucking  the actuarial tables and probably begging his boss to break a regulation . So Frank said , " I 'm very grateful to you , Wilbur , " and then he and May got into their coats and went out into the rain . Wilbur had greased the way so well that Frank , sucking in his guts tensely and trying to look eager , but not too eager , was through the mill and back on the payroll almost before he could believe it . May was ashamed , but she was brave enough to face out their friends ; she was anxious , those first few days , to know exactly how it was with him . When he lay back in his lounge chair , his slippered feet burning and his back sorer than he could admit , Frank tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up your tools and it 's exactly the same as it was twenty years ago . Same smells , same noises , same assembly lines . I 'm back in the body shop , just like I was , as if I 'd only been gone a week end instead of twenty years . Yet . . . it 's all different , and not just because they 've put up this new plant , or got a lot of automatic equipment . " " I hope you do n't work as hard as you used to . " " Nobody does . I do n't know if it 's my imagination , but everybody seems younger . They have n't got any idea what it was like in the old days . Oh , you work , you still work like a dog , but that fear of being thrown out in the street is n't there . Once you 've got your ninety days in , the unionp208protects you . " He looked sidewise at his wife . " Maybe I should have made more allowances , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to civilize the company . " " They were n't very civilized themselves . " " They would n't let you be neutral , that 's what it came down to . And when you see how different it is now . . . I feel a little funny , coming back after all this time to ride the gravy train . " Actually he felt even funnier than he said . He felt funny about being a recipient of the benefits the union had won ; and he felt the weight of the twenty years in which he had been a man of business , wearing a white shirt every day and working with his wits instead of his back . It seemed to him that everyone must be looking askance at him : the union men gloating over the downfall of someone who had been too good for them and who now crawled back to be a free-loader in his old age ; his friends and neighbors shaking their heads smugly over his degradation ; and his own family , even his little grandchildren , humiliated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made his escape earlier , only to fall back into it again now , once and for all . During these first days , while he was being shifted from job to job , he hunted instinctively for men who had sweated and suffered with him in the old days and would perhaps appreciate how he felt about re-entering their world and how he reacted to both permanence and change . He found them , but they too had changed . Buster , thep209boss to whom he had been assigned , had worked on the line with him twenty years before as a spot welder  --  but Buster was a boss like all factory bosses , living in the presentwith a vengeance , worried , harried , frightened . None of the bosses who had worked with Frank as youngsters could relax and reminisce about the days when they were all young and beating their brains out on the line . He became convinced that they simply would not fraternize , partly to make it clear to him that he was n't on an equal footing with them now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but afraid to ask  --  why he had been forced to come back to this work at his age . There were a few who had n't moved up at least a notch . Like Old Pop , however , they had soured from standing around too long . Utterly incurious , they did n't give a damn about what you 'd been doing all these years ; they had nothing to tell you about what they 'd been doing . It was written all over their faces anyway : they were waiting for retirement . But my God , Frank groaned to himself , why else am I here ? So he avoided the men of his generation at least as much as they avoided him . Instead he mixed with boys thirty years and more younger than he . They listened , they asked questions , and , even if they were utterly lacking in respect for his years , they made him feel that he was part of what was going on around him . In turn they wanted gossip about what their bosses had been like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank would say to the youngsters ,  | " every boss you see around here , with the exception of Buster , was a company man back in the days when I worked with them . " " How about Blatnik , the boss over in the grinding booth ? " " What about Halstein , the boss inspector ? " " Two of the worst . " Frank turned down the corners of his mouth and nodded heavily . " They 'd turn in their own buddies just to get in good with the bosses . And you ca n't imagine what the bosses were like . One of them caught a man smoking in the john . The man quick tossed his butt in the toilet and flushed it , but the boss reached in with his whole arm , soaking and all , and pulled the butt out for evidence . Got the man fired too , a poor Indian by the name of Snowflake . " " You 're kidding . " Frank drew himself up . " No story I could invent would do this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask Buster about Snowflake , some time when he 's not busy , and see what he says . " But then Buster did come along and broke them up . The line started to move again , and one smooth-cheeked solder flower , flipping his goggles down over his eyes and flaring the flame of his gun , said fiercely , " You ca n't tell me you worked any harder in those days than we do now . " Frank looked at him incredulously . " We were getting sixty-two and a half cents an hour and damn glad to get it ,  |p211it  was big money . You know what we did for that money ? You got any idea how fast this line moved ? It was nothing to see them sending the jobs down one a minute , and so close to each other you could n't possibly get in between them to do your work . But it was n't just that , it was the fear . " " Fear of what ? " " They called the foremen pushers in those days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high spot on the station wagon before him . He said ruminatively , " You should have heard the way they talked . " " You think they 're any different now ? " The solder flower flicked off his gun , pushed his goggles up onto his forehead , and fixed Frank with his young , intent blue eyes . " A guy the other day told me something that made me laugh . Hawks , the body shop supervisor , happened to notice . He went over to Buster and said , We 're not paying that man for standing around and grinning . Tell him to get to work , he 's supposed to be flowing solder , not smiling . ' I went over to him and said , If you 've got something to tell me , tell it to me yourself . ' He just looked at me , disgusted , and walked away . But the very next day the assistantsuperintendent of the whole damn day shift came over in his little buggy and sat in it , right there in the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes off me . Once I said something to the guy next to me , and he called me over and said , We 're not paying you for conversation . Do your work on the job and your talking onp212your lunch hour . ' It 's lucky he drove off , I would have slugged him . " " Now let me tell you something . In the old days if you 'd opened a mouth like that , you 'd have been out in the street like a shot . Those pushers would walk right alongside of you as you worked , laughing at the way you were sweating and not even giving you time to wipe it off . What 's the matter ? ' they 'd yell . Ca n't you keep up ? There 's five thousand men waiting outside the gates for your job , so if you do n't want the money , just say so . ' They 'd keep it up on you all day long , riding you , screaming at you , Five thousand men waiting , five thousand men waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were . " That silenced the boy . I 'm talking like a union agitator , Frank thought , but what 's true is true . The years in business , bad ones and good ones , when he had been a man among men , scheming , figuring , dreaming , guessing , gambling , succeeding and failing , had absorbed him to the point where he had completely buried the eleven murderous years on the assembly line ; but now that he was here once again , the flood of reminiscence was so turbulent that he could not keep it confined . Sitting in the great humming cafeteria with five hundred strangers around him , all talking , eating , smoking , and shouting at once , he raised his eyes from his lonely plate to observe a plant policeman , resplendent in powder-blue uniform , stroll in from the bosses ' cafeteria and pose motionlessin the doorway.  |p213Instantly  every sound ceased and there was a moment of complete silence , as when the curtain lifts and a solitary figureis seen on stage , ready to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a hurricane of catcalls , of boos and stamping feet . The guard , a chunky , red-faced little man , thrust his thumbs deeper into his Sam Browne belt and stood his ground , his face turning redder , creased by a halfapologetic , half-proud smile . " This happen often ? " Frank asked the man on his right . " Every time he sticks his nose in here . Kind of like those prison scenes in the movies , is n't it ? " Frank nodded absently . " Those guards used to be the worst elements , the dregs . I 've seen them pick up a man bodilyand carry him past the gates , crying and kicking . They had no respect for any human being , they were like a bunch of trained dogs . " But when Frank paused , he realized that the man to whom he had been speaking was no longer listening . At home May listened , but he did not want to tell her how the job brought back all the garbage of the past . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for me to get over that ninety-dayhump . As it is , I 'm still probationary and I never know from one day to the next what I 'll be doing . " In plain truth , Frank was frightened . Wilbur was being transferred to the West Coast . If Management felt like takingback the favor they had done , there would be nothing and no one to stop them . And if I 'm not good enough for this , what will I do then ? Frank asked himself in the dead ofp214the night , fagged and aching beside his softly snoring wife . If they dump me , what then ? " Grandpa , " Donnie asked , " what do you do in the auto factory ? " " It 's . . . hard to explain , without getting technical . What I do  --  well , it has to do with preparing the automobilesto be painted . " Frank added , with hearty vagueness , " It 's mighty complicated , putting together all those cars . " " Well , I 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the factory some day next week . " The pointed , questing face turned up trustingly . " And I 'm going to look for you , Grandpa , and then I 'll be able to prove to my friends that you make all those new cars , like I told them in Show and Tell ! " From then on his working day became not just physically wearing , but nervously exhausting too . With Wilbur gone , Frank had no assurance that he would be kept on . Now he also had to keep an eye out for each party of tourists that passed through the body shop , fearful that Donnie and his classmates would come upon him unawares . Watching for Donnie , he was made painfully aware of the contrast between himself and the businessmen who came down the aisles , staring curiously about them and nudging one another as they strolled . Escorted by a joking company guide , they stepped carefully so as not to soil their trousers , laughing among themselves , adjusting the name cards thatp215adorned their lapels and gazing not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various stages of completion . Frank grew panicky every time he saw tourists approaching . He shrank down , he opened the door of the car on which he was working and cowered behind it , he blew his nose with a large handkerchief ; what if a group of conventioningcandy jobbers were to come through and spot him ? Even if they said nothing , even if they controlled their faces and smiled politely , the thought of how they would speak of him after they had passed out of earshot was enough to make Frank cringe inside his work clothes . One morning he was stuck on a job just at the aisle as a guided group came along . There was nothing for it ; he had to go on with what he was doing under the eyes of salesmen who wore starched French cuffs and smelled of shaving lotion . Down on one knee like a supplicant , he filed away dazedlyand heard with humming ears the comments of the laughing visitors as they moved their polished shoes only a few feet beyond his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knee throbbed , one of them broke free from the group and advanced to the line . " Tell me honestly now , " he demanded of the metal finisherworking beside Frank , " which make of car would you recommend my buying ? " " You know something ? That is an embarrassing ques-tion ! " The salesman broke out in a guffaw . " D' you hear that ? " he cried out after his group , trotting to catch up as theyp216passed the bonderizing booth . " D' you hear what he said ? " " For God 's sake , " Frank said to the boy , " what 'd you want to say a thing like that for ? " The metal finisher looked at him , puzzled . " What the hell 's the difference ? It was just a joke . " He was right . But why do I care ? Frank asked himself . There were two reasons . He was still living in the old days , when you could have gotten fired on the spot for talkinglike that ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what he did . His new work clothes were already stained , spotted , and torn ; his undershirt , showing out above the neck of his blue cotton shirt , was brown-rimmed , not because he wore it too long but because his perspiration , chemically affected by the lead in the air , stained underclothing , sheets , and pillow cases , even after he had bathed . With his scant hair disheveled and gritty , he looked like nothing more than what he was , an old workingman . What a horror that he should be seen this way by passing strangers , or by his own grandson ! So he watched , and one morning he did see a group of school children coming up the aisle . Without having to look closely , Frank knew that his solemn , black-haired grandson was in this third-grade expedition and that his sharp eyes would be darting here and there , seeking the grandpa of whom he was so proud . If Frank stood his ground , Donnie would see his grandpa as he had never seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty , tired men , one of thousands ; notp217powerful , not exceptional , no more responsible than the least of them for the shining marvels that rolled off the final assembly line ; different from the rest only in that he was older and more whipped than most . Frank glanced around quickly to see that Buster was not watching , stuck his file and sandpaper halfway into the open ventilator pipe of his car , and scuttled across the aisle . There a ten-foot-high stack of station-wagon doors gave him shelter . Sweating with anxiety , Frank passed his dirty handkerchiefacross his wet forehead . He could have groaned aloud from shame as he peered cautiously around the edge of the stacked doors , searching for little Donnie in the knot of babbling boys and girls . He was easy to find . Far in the rear , he hunted worriedly , almost stealthily , ignoring everyone as he looked for his grandpa in all this glamorous , clamorous profusion . His head cocked now to the right and now to the left , he peered down low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the confidence was fading from his searching , pointed little face . How often they had played this game together , laughing and panting from closet to closet , from bush to tree ! But always before this Frank had allowed himself to be caught , chuckling behind a garment bag , or to have his big fat rump slapped because it stuck out from the lilac bush . Now , for the first time , he was desperate not to be discovered . " If it is n't old Frank ! " His heart gave a great lurch . He whirled clumsily in the narrow space and confronted a man as heavy as he , with anp218underbite like a bulldog and a short , steaming pipe clenched between his teeth . He wore the loud yellow shirt of the union committeemen , with his name , Lou , embroidered in black above the breast pocket . " What 're you so nervous about ? Do n't you remember me ? " " Yes , sure , of course . " It came back to him as he spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old days . " Frank added quickly , to forestall further questions , " I was surprisedthat you remembered me . How long have you been a committeeman ? " He glanced over his shoulder . The thirdgradershad passed on , and Donnie was disappearing from view . " I heard you were back in the shop . That 's part of my job , I 've been a plant committeeman five years now . I was vicepresidentonce before that . It beats working . Besides , it 's satisfying to help the boys out . Say , did they take the tendollarinitiation fee out of your pay check yet , Frank ? " " Last week . " " Bring in the check stub . Any former member in good standing that comes back is entitled to have it refunded . You 're supposed to turn in your withdrawal card with it , but what the hell , back in those days we were just organized . Besides , I 'll vouch for you , I used to see you at meetings . " Frank stepped out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agitators whose militancy had driven him out of the factory and into the business world where you depended only on your own personal strength . P219Fortunately the line had slowed almost to a stop , and his job , with his file jutting out of it , stood not far from them . He wiped his palms on his dungarees and accepted Lou 's clean hand . " That 's very kind of you . " " Ten bucks is ten bucks . They 're expecting me over in Labor Relations , we 're processing a hot grievance . Do n't forget that stub , Frank . " Lou clapped him on the back and was gone in a cloud of plumed blue smoke . Frank felt confused . As he bent grimly to his work , feelingthe folds of flesh protesting , he was sick with a double guilt at hiding from Donnie and at encountering Lou ; but if he had somehow reversed it  --  if he had stepped out and hailed his little grandson , and then hidden from the union official  --  would n't he have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sought him out , both of them , when he had wanted above everything to remain forgotten and alone . It made him wonder , gnawingly , whether maybe May was n't right , whether he was n't attempting the impossible , crawling into this noisy , dirty hole and pulling the lid down over his head . But what else could I have done ? he asked himself . Could I have opened a hole-in-the-wall candy store and made half what I 'm making now , with nothing at the end of the road to show for the endless hours and the swollen feet ? He had a sudden vision of himself waiting for trade behind the counter of a failing store , of May in the back room where the stale stock was stored , heating him a pot of coffee over a single burner , of Donnie and Jerry coming in to get free candy , of Ray slipping him an en/velope containing rent money that he could hardly spare . No , he said to himself , no matter how much Ray is ashamed of me now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thought swelled in him like the satisfaction of a good deed , and as it spread it crowded out the less agreeable thoughts one by one until he grew to feel that no one else had fully recognized the act of courage involved in going back to this life . He resolved that he would hide from no one any more . That night Donnie called him on the telephone . " Grandpa , we went through the factory today and I looked all over for you , but I could n't find you . " " I know , sonny . I saw you , but I could n't come over to you . I work pretty hard there . " Frank looked up into his wife 's eyes . " I figured you did . I told my friends you were in confer-ence . " Frank hesitated . " Where 'd you hear that ? Your father say that ? " " No , Daddy told me you were there like all those other men , but I thought he was kidding . " " He was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to , in order to take care of Grandma and me , so we 'll have money for when we get old . " He considered for an instant , then laughed and said , " I mean real old . " When he had hung up , he shuffled back to his three-wayp221chair and eased himself onto it like a man leaning back for a barber shave . His wife patted him as she passed . " So that 's how it goes , " she said mildly . " Why not ? If I 'm going to be there ten years we all might as well start to get used to it . I was n't ashamed of working during those first eleven years I was there , was I ? So why should I be now ? " " Nobody ever said , " May replied in her familiar shorthand . He was satisfied . And besides , he thought , although he did not know quite how to put it into words , perhaps he belonged in the factory even more now than he had as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and neither was the factory , although it was new . Fewer and fewer laborers would be needed as the years went by and automation proceeded ; the work would be less and less physically demanding ; and he could even foresee dimly , as one half-believingly envisions one 's children full of years , a time when the factory would be one vast , echoing cavern , the moving lines , belts , pulleys , and conveyors doing their tasks unaided by human sweat , only tended here and there by a besmocked , unsoiled technician , keen and watchful . Who more logical to observe this gradual depopulation , this slow disappearance of the working class , than he himself , the prodigal who had returned to make his peace with the factory world ? . . . Meantime , however , the drudgery remained . Before he and May turned in , he riffled through the pa/pers in the desk drawer until he found the stub of his pay check , and he transferred it to the wallet in his work pants . The next day was payday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the deductions , Frank rememberedbitterly the taut expectancy with which he used to check out his cash register and add up the cash receipts . " Always like this on payday , " muttered Pop , the old inspector . " Too many men , not enough work for everybody ! " Frank looked at him uneasily . " What do you mean , too many men ? " " There 's so many guys knock off one or two days a week to look for other work , the only way the company can pull production is to hire more than they need . But then when everybody shows up on payday , they got too many . " How different from the old days ! But did n't it prove that none of the absentees were any more satisfied than he with what they did , that in the end all of them were united by one bond and one bond only : the pay check ? But he had alighted for good , to serve out his term perched here like an old bird , while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still taking trial flights to see if there was some place else they could land , some work place that would sustain them better than this . Had he really acquired the courage of renunciation , the kind of courage you needed when you got older ? He was startled by the approach of Buster , rags and can of naphtha in hand.  | " Here , Frank , " the foreman said , " never mind that metal-finishing . I 've got an extra metal finisher as it is . Soak these rags and wipe the whole panel clean on every job , then scrub it up and down , you know how , to bring out the high lights . They want the metal finishers to be able to see what they 're working on . " Frank shrugged . The indeterminate They , the planners and the engineers , were always devising more exhausting ways to do a dull job  --  it was one means of justifying their existence . It also meant that he was expendable . Panting as he labored , Frank assured himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on me . What he meant was , although he could hardly dare to put it into words : Not after what I 've swallowed these last few weeks , in here , on the street , from my friends , even from my family . But Buster approached again and stood watching him . Frank sensed that he was going to say something ; waiting and working , he could bear it no longer . His face red , the vein in his temple pounding , he spoke without straighteningup from his work . " This is miserable work , " he said tensely . " You might as well leave off . " Buster used his tongue to shift his cigar . " They want you over by the body shop office . " " Now ? " " Yes . " Buster turned quickly and walked away , as if afraid that he would be asked why.  |p224Frank  put down the dirty rags and the sandpaper block and walked down the aisle and over another aisle to the body shop office . A dozen men were gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several stood with folded arms ; two squatted on their haunches like soldiers planning strategy with their fingertips in the dust ; three leaned pensively against the glass partition that boxed in the office from the factory noises ; one sat withdrawn on the red fireplug with his legs crossed , fingering a cigarette and mutteringto himself . A leaner , a man who had been hired at the same time as Frank , gave him a nod of recognition . " They tapped you too , eh ? " Frank raised his eyebrows . " What 's up ? " " We 're getting laid off , that 's what . All of us . " The man laughed angrily . " I 'd like to know what the hell they hired us for if they did n't need us . " " But . . . " Frank stopped helplessly . There was nothing to say . A smooth-faced boy nudged him frankly . " Say , pop , have n't you got seniority ? " He shook his head wordlessly . " You have n't been here ninety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt alone and naked . He was no closer to these fellow victims than he was to the masked men just across the aisle who carefully ignored them because they still had their spotwelding guns and their jobs . They waited together sullenly for an hour , perhaps less ,  |p225|perha|ps  more  --  Frank did not draw out his pocket watch . He knew only , as he stood silently amid the curses around him , that he had descended like a skin diver past all the other sunken wrecks of his fifty-six-year plunge through the waters of his destiny until he had struck bottom . There had been the bland bankers ' faces of the comfortable men who had refused him credit ; there had been the depression faces of the harried women who had refused to buy his tableware ; there had been the averted faces of his son and nephew , fearing that he would ask them for money , hoping despite their shame that he would cling to this job like a sea gull to a rock . But now there were no more faces for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean floor , the breath gone from his lungs , his brain pleading uselessly for oxygen . What do I tell Donnie now , he wondered , now that I have started with the truth ? Do I go on with it and explain to an eight-year-old how it feels to be fired  --  kicked out and flung aside at fifty-six ? Or do I consult first with his parents about their modern psychology of handling problems like jobless Grandpa  --  and so plead without words , Ray , my son , my son , help me ? The yellow shirt of Lou the committeeman flashed past him . And stopped . Lou turned , his hand on the doorknob of the body shop office . " Hi , Frank , " he said . " You bring in that check stub for me ? " Frank fumbled with the button on his blue work shirt and at last brought forth the stub from his wallet.  | " That guys ? " Frank lifted his shoulders . He swallowed . " Buster told me to report here . Getting laid off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lou drew back as though he had been told something disgusting . " Wait right here . " He plunged into the office , where he at once encountered Hawks , the body shop superintendent . His jaw was working and his finger pointing , but it was impossible to hear a sound through the glass . The two of them , their mouths moving , retreated under the fluorescents until they had gained the privacy of a partitioned office . Fascinated , jealous , brought back to life , the discarded and forgotten men clustered around him . " How come he knows you ? " " You think he can fix it up ? " " What 's your secret , dad ? " His hands trembling , Frank said , " Honestly , I do n't  --  " but then they all saw Lou and the sad-faced superintendent coming towards the door again . The committeeman stuck his head out the door and said abruptly : " Frank . " He stepped forward . Mesmerized , he looked up from the dazzling tie on the superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened in a brief , glacial smile and then closed again . " You used to work here . " Frank stared into the man 's dead , expressionless eyes . " I put in eleven years . " " Go on over to Vernon , the foreman next to the jigs . Tellp227him I said to give you something for the rest of the day . " He turned his back and walked to a telephone , scratching between the cheeks of his behind as he walked , ignoring the faces that watched him through the glass . Blinking , Frank suddenly realized that Lou was winking at him . " Go on , " the committeeman said in a friendly way , " finish out the day with Vernon . After that we 'll see , all right ? " Frank nodded  --  he could find no words  --  and started to go . " And say , Frank . " Lou waited until Frank had turned to face him . " You 're coming to the union picnic tomorrow , are n't you ? " " Why , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old gang 'll be there . Bring the kiddies  --  we 'll have rides , eats , the works . " He waved and was gone . Vernon gave Frank a can of red primer and a brush . " Paint around the ventilator pipe and inside the gas-tank door at the back . " For the rest of the day Frank circled the swinging steel bodies , dabbing and daubing and wondering what to do when he got home . He had still not decided when the siren blew and he took his shuffling place in line at the time clock . Tensely he moved forward until he could see his own card in the rack . No pink card , as he had half expected  --  and as there were , scattered here and there through therack  --  saying : DO NOT PUNCH THIS . BRING IT TO THEp228OFFICE . He took out his old card from the slot , punched it , and went home . May was baking . He entered , sniffing , and was caught up in a sudden feeling of love for her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her apron and pouting for a kiss . " How 's everything , Daddy ? " He evaded by demanding , " What do I smell ? " " Apple pie . The apples Ray brought are so good I hated to think of them going to waste . " When they had finished dinner , Frank told her what had happened without trying to explain to her how he had felt . At the end he said , " So there 's this picnic . There 's no place I want to go less , but I feel obliged to show up on account of Lou 's going to bat for me . " " We could take Donnie and Jerry , they 'd love it . Why do n't you want to go ? " Frank stared at his wife , dismayed . " How does it look , my hanging around those labor people at my age ? You know I was never hot for the union . Then supposing Monday comes  --  and I get laid off ? They 'll think I came purposely to save my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They would n't think that about you . People can tell what you are by your face , Frank . " There was already a great crowd when Frank and May arrived at the picnic grounds , Frank holding Donnie by thep229hand , May carrying Jerry . Tags were pinned to them all , and Frank , labeled and lost , wished with all his heart that he were locked in his living room with the TV ; but then the boys spotted the jelly-apple stand , and the day was turned over to them at last , in Frank 's mind as well as in fact . He and May split up to take the children on different rides . His own separateness from the other picnickers seemed unimportant as he watched Donnie 's face turn red and white with awful glee as he clutched the rail of his dodgem car . While he stood alone in the sawdust , craning his neck and shouting encouragement to Donnie , a strangerwearing one of the yellow committeeman shirts tapped him on the shoulder . " Say , brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the blood coming to his face . " I 'm more than that , I guess anybody can tell . " The man laughed aloud , showing two missing canines . " No offense , " he said in a beery voice . " We got to round up enough men for our Cover Boy contest . That 's the only regulation , you got to be over fifty . " Frank said quickly , " Oh , but I do n't want to  --  " " Come on , be a sport . It 's all in fun , and there 's going to be prizes for the winners . " " I really do n't  --  " Donnie had scrambled out of the car and threw himself immediately into the conversation . " What do n't you want , Grandpa ? What ? " The committeeman took advantage of the boy 's eager/ness . " We want your Grandpa to enter a contest , and maybe win a prize . " So of course he went to the main bandstand with Donnie and the committeeman . A pigeon-breasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshly permanented gray curls and a broad golden sash lettered LADIES ' AUXILIARY , took his name for her clipboard and jerked her thumb over her shoulder . What an old fool I am , Frank thought wearily , as he mounted the rickety steps of the bandstand and sat down with a group of older men , one or two of whom he recognized , at the right of the union 's marching band . The woman had seated Donnie down in the front row . Sinking his new grown-up teeth fiercely into his jelly apple , Donnie waved to his Grandpa and cocked his feet up . Beforehe fully understood what was going on , Frank was beingled across the stage in front of the musicians ; a scatter of applause rose in volume as he crossed the boards . Surprised , he looked out past his cheering grandson . All the empty rows were being filled with members and their wives , many of whom were clapping vigorously for him . " Say , what is this ? " he demanded , his ears burning , and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a numberedcard . Oh my God , he thought miserably , they 're making fun of me . He shrank down wretchedly into the collar of his sport jacket , but the crowd , seeing his embarrassment , began to clap all the louder . As he stood there , he was joined one byp231one by the other contestants , facing all of the shouting , laughing throng of their fellow workers . The master of ceremoniesheld his card above the head of each in turn , demandinga verdict in applause . It was a blur to Frank  --  the noise , the whistles , the laughter , the rattling drums . He thought he heard voices shouting , " Hey , Frankie ! Frankie boy ! " but he was not certainwhether they were calling to him or to someone else . Rubbing his sweating palms up and down on his hips , he looked about like a trapped animal . A sharp-nosed old gafferfrom the material-handling department , who had been playing up to the crowd , was being presented with a small silver loving cup  --  he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frank was next . As he wiped his hand across his face unbelievingly , he looked down to see a box of cigars being thrust toward him . " The second prize winner , Frank , the handsomest man in the body shop , and a real good sport ! " " No , no , I really ca n't , " Frank started to say , but everyone was crowding around him and clapping him on the back , the band was playing , and out on the grass beyond Donnie , who was jumping up and down and waving his jelly apple , was May with Jerry on her shoulder . No one was ridiculing him , he realized at last  --  everyone was beingsimply friendly . As Frank approached his wife and his grandsons , he was intercepted by Lou the committeeman , his pipe streamingp232clouds of smoke in the afternoon air . " Been looking all over for you . " " I sort of got shanghaied into this thing . " " What the hell , you can always smoke the cigars . Listen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night after work .
