" Beliefs are decisive . Beliefs made the Ten Years 1940-49 what they were . Catastrophic beliefs engendered catastrophe . " Thus highbrow British Author Frederick A. Voigt , a member of the Church of England , diagnoses the illnesses of the times . The articles of modern man 's creed , says Voigt , in England 's Roman Catholic magazine The Month , are : <P> " Religion without God ; Christianity without Christ ; Christ without Antichrist ; Heaven without Hell ; works without faith ; a God of Love but not of Wrath ; a Church that can bless but can not curse . <P> " We believe that God , almighty and incarnate , is but a benevolent Spirit ; that Satan does not exist ; that Christ was the author of an ethical code , but not the Godhead crucified . We profess to believe that He existed , for agnosticism is no longer the fashion . We believe that the Gospels must conform with our time and not our time with the Gospels . . . <P> " All articles of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian ethic . ' The ' Christian ethic ' is the Antichrist of the Western world . It is the most insidious and formidable corruption that ever afflicted that world . . . <P> " In what is our hope ? In the famine and thirst ! The danger ... is that the hunger and the thirst will be stilled by the frothy pabulum of the ' Christian ethic , ' and that the people will be full and yet not fed . But there are signs . . . that the people no longer ' love to have it so . ' In the gnawing hunger and the burning thirst is our only hope : ' Not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the Lord . ' ' '
