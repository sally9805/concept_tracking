Stretching for some 190 miles along the southern slopes of the Himalayas , north of India and south of Tibet , lies the most remote kingdom in the world . The upland valleys of tiny ( 18,000 sq . mi . ) Bhutan are as green and inviting as those of Shangri-La , and the passes that lead into them just as forbidding . Icy winds howl along the snowswept plains behind the mountain passes to discourage the traveler . Rugged barriers of snow and ice rise as high as 24,000 ft . Dense semitropical growth clogs the lower valleys . Fever haunts the forests , making them uninhabitable to all except endlessly prowling tigers and rhinos . <P> Time &; again attempts by neighboring India to build roads into Bhutan have been halted by the ravages of wild elephants which rip up the road beds and tear down the bridges , but the Bhutanese do n't mind at all . In fact they like it that way , and if by chance a foreigner wishes to brave the nine-day journey by mule-back over the mountains into Bhutan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King himself . The King is very careful about choosing the people he invites to Bhutan . <P> Up to 1907 , Bhutan , like Tibet , was ruled jointly by a high lama , the Dharma Raja , who was believed to be the reincarnation of Buddha himself , and a temporal leader , the Deb Raja . Finding a new reincarnation of Buddha when the old one died was always a trouble . It involved waiting several years and then finding a baby who would proclaim his identity by recognizing certain suitable symbols . By 1907 Bhutan 's lamas , grown fat and indolent with centuries of rule , got too lazy to hunt for a new Raja . The government was taken over by a local governor , the Tongsa Penlop , a fighting politician who got himself elected Gyalpo ( i.e. , King ) of the Land of the Thunder-dragon . Knighted by the British , who understood such ambition , Sir Ugyen Wangchuk ruled for 19 years and died in 1926 . He was succeeded by his son , Sir <P> Jigme Wangchuk . Three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Jigme renewed an old treaty leaving all the foreign affairs of his country to India in exchange for a guarantee of sovereignty at home and 500,000 rupees a year . In March 1952 , Sir Jigme died . <P> Last week , in a ceremony which by tradition includes an honor guard of silk-uniformed soldiers , each carrying two swords and a shield of buffalo hide , Sir Jigme 's 24-year-old son , Jigme Dorji , was installed as the third Gyalpo of Thunder-dragon . Two visitors-the eldest son of the Maharaja of neighboring Sikkim and an Indian political agent-were invited over the mountains to see the show . They were the only outsiders present .
