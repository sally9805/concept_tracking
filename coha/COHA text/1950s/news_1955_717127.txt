txt In attempting to cope with the situation which was caused by last year 's unprecedentedly disastrous floods , followed by a severe drought this year , Peking has initiated drastic austerity measures together with a fanfare of campaigns against extravagance , waste , and corruption , as well as reviving an old campaign against " counterrrevolutionaries " and foreign agents . Government payrolls arc being slashed and the amount of grain in the markets will be reduced by as much as 50 per cent in the face of the existing shortage . The Peking government also has slowed down its collectivization program and possibly to meet growing rural unrest has greatly speeded up its drive for new party members outside the cities . In Szechwan Province alone 100,000 new members have been recruited this year . From reports reaching Hong Kong it is impossible to gauge the extent of actual starvation in China . Chinese characters which westerners generally translate as famine really mean drought with all its attendant difficulties . Nonetheless it is apparent that conditions are appallingly bad in the Provinces of Kwangtung , Kwangsi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other provinces less seriously affected . Grain Bought Peking has admitted that 300 , - 000,000 Chinese  --  or half the population  --  are presently living on bought grain , a high percentage indeed for a predominantly agricultural country . From the political point of view the most important aspect of the food shortage will be its effect on the industrialization program . The second National People 's Congress will meet in Peking next month and the five-year plan will be the principal item on the agenda . It appears certain that plans and estimates already modified will get a further heavy pruning on this occasion . Some indication of this was given in a recent Peking Peoples Daily editorial calling for an over-all economy drive in order to accumulate funds for capital investment , Citing an example the editorial said a state textile industry had recently reevaluated its program and as a result it either has stopped or postponed construction of 800 , - 000 spindles , possibly more than half the total it planned to manufacture . Obviously , in spite of the fact that all available grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being produced to finance the industrial building program . The campaign against wastage of grain now has reached a peak , every individual being urged to consume one ounce less a day , while the government has announced that state grain sales must be reduced by between 20 and 50 per cent . In a recent editorial , a Peking newspaper stated : " The phenomenon of waste in man , money , and material power is known to be rather common with state organs and is most serious in certain establishments . " The same paper pointed out that in some government offices , documents passed through more than 40 pairs of hands before being acted upon . Graft Disclosed Reflecting Peking 's uneasiness over the food situation , corruption is also under heavy attack . Admitting that corruption is growing , the Tientsin Ta Kung Pao stated editorially : ' ' Graft and embezzlement in Shanghai state and commercial organizations have reached such an extent as to endanger the economic construction of the country and the economic life of the people . " Other editorialists seeking scapegoats lay heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling monopoly . Numerous cases of government organizations drawing grain for nonexistent employees are angrily cited . The railway administration in Hunan Province drew food for six months for 10,000 persons who did not exist , it was disclosed . Meanwhile in the country organization of new producer cooperatives , the second step toward collectivization has been slowed down and in some areas stopped altogether . Although this may be largely seasonal to allow spring planting to be completed , there are indications that the cooperative movement , young though it is , has not paid the expected dividends of increased production . On top of that there are definite signs that this unpopular movement has destroyed farmers ' initiative in many areas . There can be no doubt that the Chinese Communist Government is in serious economic trouble and the recent placatory tone of its leaders may be a direct result . Meanwhile , officials recognize that the yearly flood season is at hand and admit that existing dikes are not nearly so strong as they should be .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
