Indonesia 's President Sukarno seems to believe that a new Konsepsi can cure anything , even the ramshackle government and economy of his sprawling nation of 85.5 million people . In 1957 he proposed that Indonesia be purged of its innumerable troubles through " guided democracy , " a procedure that he expounded repeatedly without ever quite explaining . Last week , unable to have his way , Sukarno was abandoning guided democracy for a new concept which , instead of " burying " the rival political parties , would only be intended to " simplify " them . <P> The problem is one that bothers every new nation - reconciling the need for system and order with democratic procedures when no one has much experience in such matters . Worked out in collaboration with his able Prime Minister Djuanda and National Council Chief Ruslan Abdulgani , <P> Sukarno 's new plan aims at reforming the parliament before the next election . Of parliament 's 300 members , half will be selected from " functional " groups ( trade unions , business organizations , women 's clubs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of parliament by political parties . The functional list will then be screened by a government coordinating agency and passed on to Sukarno himself , who has the authority to arrange the order in which candidates will appear on the ballot . <P> Voters will cast two ballots , one for political parties ( not individual candidates ) , the other for functional groups . In actual practice , Sukarno will have the authority to hand-pick half the members of parliament . The chief losers under the new system will be the Moslem Masjumi Party , many of whose leaders backed the " rebellion of the colonels " that still flickers in the outer islands , and the Communists . For the Reds the new Konsepsi is also a bitter blow , since under the old system they had been confident of winning the next elections and coming to power legally . But Red Boss D. N. Aidit was obviously under instructions from Peking not to go into opposition against Sukarno and the efficient Indonesian army under anti-Communist Lieut . General Abdul Haris Nasution.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
