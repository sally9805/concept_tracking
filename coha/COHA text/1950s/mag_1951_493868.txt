CENTURY OF NEWS THE STORY OF THE NEW YORK TIMES , by Meyer Berger ( Simon &; Schuster ; $5 ) . RAYMOND OF THE TIMES , by Francis Brown ( Norton ; $5 ) . THESE NOTES on the books which commemorate the 100th anniversary of the New York Times may be a trifle sentimental . But perhaps that is permissible in one who never worked on the staff of the good gray lady of Forty-third Street . To some of us the Times may seem a little dull . Like so many companions of our childhood , youth and maturity , it is a little hard to get along with . But there can be no mistake about the fact that the last ten decades would have been less enlightened without this vast and complete newspaper . As could be expected , the volumes by Meyer Berger and Francis Brown are not very critical . The former is one of the ablest reporters on the Times and the latter is editor of the Sunday book . review section . To the credit of Arthur Hays Sulzberger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book is a dreary , official document . Both are readable ; both are honest . Their pages , like the files of the Times , are the history of the United States since 1851 . Perhaps the pages lack discernment , but nobody can say that they are incomplete . Two really great men shaped the destiny of the New York Times as we know it today . One was Adolph Ochs , who built the newspaper from financial obscurity . The other was that genius of a managing editor , Carr V. Van Anda . Old-timers in the newspaper business will never forget either of them . Ochs had little formal education and throughout his life was in awe of college-trained men . He was no writer . He was , though , a managerial wizard and his integrity was unquestioned . Above all , the publisher of the Times was an enthusiast . His newspaper , as it developed to greatness , was ? he felt ? the most wonderful one in the world . His staff was the most able . It is as follows that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight . The first edition had come from the presses . Ochs would eagerly read its damp pages . " Ah ! " he would say happily , " I do really believe that this is the best issue we have ever put out . " He said that nearly every night . The great newspaper was his life and his consuming pride . And Carr Van Anda of the mathematical mind , the insatiable curiosity and the never failing thirst for news ? One can merely say of Van Anda , as Berger makes clear , that he is safely enrolled among the immortals of the Fourth Estate along with Marse Henry Watterson and Frank Cobb of the New York World . Like Ochs , Berger writes , Van Anda " scorned the sensational , cheap or tawdry appeal . " They made their policy pay , too . The Times may have been stuffy . It covered the news , however , or all of it that was fit to print . Competitor after competitor died despite its glaring headlines . Francis Brown 's book on Henry Jarvis Raymond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interesting to learn the degree to which the first editor impressed his personality on the paper . The New York Daily Times , as it was first called , proposed to print all the news . It would be fair and without bias . But those were different days . Henry Raymond was up to his neck in active politics , the mere thought of which would horrify Arthur Sulzberger . Those were the days of personal journalism , when Horace Greeley , James Gordon Bennett and the other giants flung their bolts at one another . " Personal abuse every editor anticipated and Raymond was no stranger to it , " says Brown . So Bennett called the Times a " penny abolition paper " when it resisted the spread of slavery , and the editor was " likened to a monkey , prying into everything , continually chattering over small discoveries , and always very busy about very insignificant trifles . " The Times , added the publisher of the Herald , was " bereft of all virility and strength . " Well , the New York Herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Globe of beloved memory . So is the New York Sun , the passing of which nobody will regret . The Times goes on . Sometimes difficult to read and rarely marked by excellence of writing , it has always been indispensable . The Times may well boast that it is a journal of record . Its record is very good indeed .
