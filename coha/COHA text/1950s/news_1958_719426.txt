txt The session of Congress that opens in Washington today may be one of the most important in modern American history . It may well determine whether or not we Americans , through our elected representatives , have the imagination , the resilience and the will ? as we surely have the strength  --  to pull ourselves together for the long haul . Given a maximum of forceful , candid leadership , and a minimum of political backbiting. there can be no doubt that we will meet our responsibilities with vigor and with success . There also can be no doubt that the path these next few years will be difficult , requiring discipline , sacrifice and hard work . Congress as it meets today has to face the fact that our country is in trouble . Our people are troubled ; too . Complacency has been shaken loose . and it is a good thing that it has . We have learned that we are not necessarily preordained to remain at the top of the scientific , economic and political heap ; and that if the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind and spirit ? we can not sit idly by , resting on our laurels . We also can not panic . In our form of government , leadership-must come from the Executive ; but at this stage of the game Congress will be playing an increasingly significant part in the direction of our Government . Both houses are firmly in the hands of the opposition party ; and l958 is an election year . This situation makes it all the more necessary at this critical stage of national and world affairs for the legislative chieftains on both sides of the aisle and in both houses to exercise restraint in the political process . The most urgent thing for Congress to do at this session is , of course , to make adequate provision for the present and future defense of the United States irrespective of cost . This does not mean throwing money around uselessly , but it does mean placing budgetary balance at a lower priority than national defense , if the two can not be reconciled . Furthermore , economic aid programs are as much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under no circumstances can foreign aid be allowed to bear the brunt of any increased military expenditure . Nor must foreign trade programs be sacrificed in the process . All of these problems  --  military defense ( with the missiles inquiry going on in the background ) , foreign aid . international trade  --  together with a whole new approach to Federal assistance to education ? will constitute vital work for this second session of the Eighty-fifth Congress . Domestic economic problems may demand increasing attention . The host of secondary ' but still tremendously important issues , in agriculture and labor , for instance , will add to the difficulty of the work and doubtless to the length of the session . Sharp divisions within both parties , for both have their liberal and their conservative wings , will make things more inteiesting but no easier during these next six or eight months in Washington , with the image of November constantly getting nearer . But the great majority of the members convening on Otipitol Hill today surely oi realie in what a serious po- sition our country is ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly .
