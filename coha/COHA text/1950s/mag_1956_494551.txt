NOVEMBER 19 , 1956 of Homer 's Iliad , and is properly a " mock-heroic . " The intention of the author is two-fold : half-seriously endow ? ing the incidents of everyday life with epic dignity , in the belief that there is nothing mean and trivial to the poet and philosopher , and that it is the man that adds dignity to the occasion , and not the occasion that dignifies the man ; half-satirically treating the human events alluded to as though they were non-heroic , and only fit to be applied to the events of animal life .

IN the summer of 1931 , Thomas Wolfe was living in the Assyrian quarter of Brooklyn , alone as always . lie was trying hard to write a second novel , while spending some of his nights with an attractive young woman in Manhattan . At last she wrote him one of those serious letters which , for lovers both living on the subway circuit , fore The Letters of ? Thomas Wolfe , collected and edited by Elizabeth Nowell ( Scribner 's ; $10 ) . shadow either marriage or the end of an affair . Wolfe was n't looking forward to either alternative , but he did n't rush over to see the young woman , as she doubtless hoped he would do . Instead he wrote . another serious letter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery upstairs and my first impulse on read ? ing it was to call you up right away . But your letter seemed so fine and clear . to me that I thought I would try to answer you in ? the same way , before talking to you , and I wonder that I did not try it before ? this is my usual means of expression ? paper and pencil  - -  - and I believe I can be much more direct and less confused in this way than in conversation . The letter went on for more than 20 pages of Wolfe 's urgent scrawl . It was admirably frank and considerate , and it said at great length what could have been said less clearly , but more effective ? ly for his purpose , in a few stamrhered words and an embrace . Wolfe was never - completely at home in those other lan ? guages that most persons employ in most of their intimate relations : the language of gestures , the language of hints and indirections . He was completely articu ? late only when he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more arti ? culate than anyone else who has lived on this continent . He thought as if with the pencil as it raced over sheet after sheet . Some ? times he wrote a letter to discover how he felt , and it might even be the writing that gave birth to his feelings . There are letters in which he started calmly , grew angry as he wrote , then furious , but overcame his rage in expressing it and was reconciled before the sprawled signature . Some of his most revealing letters were never mailed , but they had served a purpose ; they satisfied his pas ? sion for digesting every experience into written words . " What he wrote he saved , as other persons save money or heirlooms or press clippings and photographs . This particular letter , not one of the un ? mailed ones , has a history that casts light on more than one aspect of Wolfe 's character . After the affair was broken off , he demanded that the letter be returned ? perhaps because he was afraid that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had periods of unreasoning suspicion ; but he must have wanted it for another reason too . Doubtless he thought that it might even ? tually be used in a. section of the many-volumed novel ? " the book , " as he called it ? in which he tried to include everything he had felt or thought or observed , the whole world of his memories . ONG after his death in 1938 , Eliza beth Nowell found the letter among his papers in the Houghton Library at Harvard , and she has printed it with seven hundred others , mailed and un ? mailed , in a collection that helps to ad ? vance his own design . Miss Nowell , who was his literary agent and loyal friend , has proved herself to be a scru ? pulous editor . She has written a modest ? ly useful introduction and has provided background material for some of the letters , but not too much of it ; she stays in the background , where an editor belongs . As for the collection , it in ? cludes everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were printed in 1943 , and the more intimate letters to the late Aline Bern ? stein , which she had been saving for separate publication . The result is a very large volume , as seems appropriate to Wolfe , and one that almost everyone seriously concerned with American writing will regard as the most inter ? esting book of the year . It bears no resemblance to the usual interesting collection of letters that re ? flect a time , a place , or an order of society . Not much of the world is reflected here . There is little discussion of public affairs , there is almost no gossip , personal or literary , and there are no sidelights on famous characters ; in fact , Wolfe 's correspondence can hardly be said to depict any characters , except the author himself and his editor Maxwell Perkins . There is not much of the " you " except when he is writing to his family ; many or most of the other letters might have been addressed To Whom It May Concern . Essentially they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reflexive . They are a man expressing himself , explaining himself , and paint ? ing a self-portrait . They are the story of a man writing a novel about a man writing a novel . But the story is no less absorbing for having been told before . It is the story of a boy from the North Carolina mountains , reared not in poverty but in a sort of emotional promiscuity and squalor ; a boy with an insatiable appetite for experience who went to New York , poured his resentment into a book , and found himself a famous author at 29 , without ceasing to be a small-town boy at heart ; who had fiercer joys and sor ? rows than other people and finally achieved a sort of maturity , but who died at 37 on what seemed to be the threshold of a greater career . That is the story as Wolfe had told it in his novels , and the letters confirm what we had more than suspected , that most of his fiction was fact . But they also change the values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be lacking , so that it almost becomes a problem in human geometry , with axioms and pos ? tulates and a solution , QED . Given a certain type of literary ambition , given a high level of talent and an intense devotion , what comes afterward ? WTOLFE was determined to be a great VV VV writer , like a thousand other boys of his age , but his determination was more ardent or obsessive and was based on a special sort of emotional need . It also led to a special program , which is most clearly announced not in this vol ? ume , but in one of the early letters to his mother . The letter started calmly , with news of ? the play he had written for Professor Baker 's 47 Workshop , at Harvard , and a hint that Baker thought he would have a brilliant future . Then , growing excited as he wrote , Wolfe spoke of his plans . " I know there is nothing so commonplace , so dull , " he said , " that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to wreak out my soul on paper and express it all . This is what my life means to me : ' I am at the mercy of this thing and I will do it or die . " The next sentence revealed the nature of the " all " that he was going to express at the risk of his life . " I never forget , " he said , " I have never forgotten . I have tried ? to make myself conscious of the whole of my life since first the baby in the basket became conscious of the warm sunlight on the porch , and saw his sister go up the hill to the girl 's school on the corner ( the first thing I remember ) . " That happened when Tom was eighteen months old , and one finds it recorded in Look Homeward , Angel : . . . the second Spring , one warm day , he saw Daisy go off to the school up the hill ; it was the end of the noon recess , she had been home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other memories . recorded in that tumultuous letter to his mother . If the remembered events took place before he left North Carolina , they would reappear in Look Homeward , Angel ; if afterward , they went into Of Time and the River . Neither book was a novel in the ordi ? nary sense ; both were taken from an immense store of conscious memories , with more to follow . " This is why I think I 'm going to be an artist , " he said at the end of the letter after setting down his catalogue of impressions . " The things that really mat tered sunk in and left their inark . " Then came the program he would fol low at any cost , even that of shortening his life . " I will go everywhere and do everything . I will meet all the people I can . I will think all the thoughts , feel all the emotions I am able , and I will write , write , write . " H E was starting with an unusual equipment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a sort of unflagging energy that is a tal ? ent in itself , indispensable for his type of writing , and the energy was support ? ed by a strong physical constitution . He had the build of an All American cen ? ter ; he was six and a half feet tall , long armed and barrel chested , with a power ? ful heart . He could endure hunger , cold , and sleeplessness like an Arctic explorer , could gorge himself on meat like an Eskimo , and could withstand savage doses of coffee , tobacco , and alcohol . He had a good mind in the conven ? tional use of the term , that is , he made high marks at school and college , which he finished before he was twenty , and later at the Harvard Graduate School . He reasoned clearly and ? a curious point about an author who would de ? pend so much on sensation ? he won special distinction in a. course in logic . More important is the fact that his men ? tal operations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word . Many of his letters dashed off at top speed are careless masterpieces of eloquence . He was a teachable person , in the sense that he had a rather uncommon capacity for being helped by his elders . There were four of these , outside the family , who plaYed a decisive part in his career . The first was Mrs. Margaret Roberts , who , with her husband , ran the boys ' school that Tom attended in ' Asheville . In one of his letters he ad ? dresses her as " you mother of my spit'it who fed me with light . " The second was a father figure , George Pierce Baker of the 47 Workshop , who believed in the integrity of Wolfe 's talent and kept telling him , " Write ! Write ! Do nothing else . " The third was Aline Bernstein , whom he met on a boat returning from Europe in the summer of 1925 ; she was a successful stage designer , kind and practical , who was nineteen years older than Wolfe . She kept watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - V1 AXWELL EVARTS PERKINS , his edi- tor at Scribner 's , was the last and closest of these elder friends . Wolfe re ? garded him as a spiritual father , while Perkins ? who had five children , all daughters ? treated Wolfe as an only son . At last the son broke away from the * father , in a letter of 12,000 words ? most of Wolfe 's decisive steps were taken by writing letters ? but he con-Untied to depend on Perkins and express his gratitude . Indeed , he was grateful to all , his foster parents , even when he quarreled with them , and before the end he was reconciled with all , of them ex ? cept Baker , who had died too ' soon . But more than he relied on his capa ? city for learning from others ( and the lessons had to be those he wanted to learn ) more than he relied on his energy or strength or intelligence , Wolfe relied on his memory , or rather on a peculiar quality of his memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Novel : Y ? The quality of my memory is charac ? terized , I believe , in more than ordi ? nary degree by the intensity of its sense impressions , its power to evoke and bring back the odors , ? sounds , colors , shapes , and feel of things with concrete vividness . .. . I would ' be sitting , for example , on the terrace of a caf ? watching the flash and play of life before me on the Avenue de l'Opera and suddenly I would remember the iron railing that goes along the board ? walk at Atlantic City . I could see it instantly just the way it was , the heavy , iron pipe ; its raw , galvanized look ; the way the joints were fitted together . ? .. Or again it would ' be a bridge ; the look of an old iron bridge across an American river , the sound the train makes as it goes across it ; the spoke ? and-hollow rumble of the ties below . . . . or it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , the sound of a milk wagon as it enters an American street just at the first gray of the morning , the slow and lonely clop- ' ping of the hoof upon the street , the jink of bottles , the sudden rattle of a battered old milk can , the swift and hurried footsteps of the milkman , and again the jink of bottles , a low word . spoken to his horse , and then the great , slow , clopping hoof receding into silence . Besides the intensity and exactness of such impressions , there was another fea ? ture of Wolfe 's memory , or rather of the experiences preserved in it , that gave an urgent force to his writing . Many of the experiences had a back ? ground and color that had never been portrayed in literature . There were tender-minded persons at the time who believed that events had to reach a cer ? tain order of dignity or seemliness be ? fore they were worthy of being treated in drama or fiction . Wolfe had quite a different feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he had told his mother , " that is not touched with nobility and dignity . " He knew that his mother would un ? derstand , because he had been talking about events in their own household . They belonged to a family of " good people , " in the Southern phrase , which means hard-working people , self-re ? specting and without pretensions . The name Wolfe was Pennsylvania German , and Tom 's father was a stone cutter born near Gettysburg . The Westalls , his mother 's family , were Scotch Irish from the Carolina mountains . On both sides they were eloquent talkers , but they had never tried to preserve their talk on paper . Tom was the first writer among them , or in the town where they lived , and his voice had more power because he was conscious of speaking for the silent generations and of giving them a sort of posthumous nobility . Like Dreiser in this respect , he was a new man , speaking for a new order of society , in a country that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this equipment , and this opportunity , but he had very little time ? only a dozen years from the summer day in 1926 when he started Look Homeward , Angel . During those years he worked like a man possessed ? " like a fiend , " he kept saying in his letters ? always with the feeling that time was the enemy he had to outwit . He was trying , as Proust had done , to rescue his whole experience from time and give it a permanent meaning . Just how much , he accomplished is not a question that is answered in this volume of letters . There is another question , however , on which the letters cast some new light ; it is the meaning of his early death and whether it was an acci ? dent or , a tragedy . Most of , his friends seem to regard it as both of these and , at the same time , as a blow to the future of American letters . " That is the real tragedy ? for us , " says Wolfe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrowful memoir . " He had just come into the fullness of his powers when he died . " Miss Nowell 's introductions to the letters ends in al ? most the same fashion : " The tragedy , of course , is that the story is unfinished ? that his death at the age of 37 has left us only to speculate on what he might have come to , had he lived . " But is " tragedy " the right word for an un ? finished story and for a death that inter ? vened as these friends imply ? on a sunny day like a random bolt of light ? ning ? The end of a tragedy is written in the beginning . The death of a tragic hero is the result of a choice he has made , in which he persists at the cost of his own destruction . WOLFE too ' had made a choice , and V V there are some indications that his career was , a tragedy in the more accu ? rate sense of the word . The letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last he has found a better path , but there is another note of exhaustion and discouragement . " I am desperately tired and need a rest , " he said in letter after letter . In June , 1937 , he explained to his brother that writing is " a desperate , back-breaking , nerve-wrack ? ing and brain-fatiguing labor . . . I am not just pretending I am tired-1 am , actually , honestly and genuinely , physi ? cally and mentally . " The summer in Asheville gave him no relief . " I went home a very tired man , " he reported later , not only with all this trouble of Scribner 's gnawing , but the pressure and accumulation of everything that has happened in the past two years . And when I left home I was as near to a breakdown as I have ever been . " There would be no rest for him until May of the following year , when he started on his first and last trip to the Northwest . Meanwhile , among his com ? plaints of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must have hesitated to confess : the fear that not only his strength but his subject matter was being exliausted . " No mat ? ter how great a man 's material may be , it has its limits , " he had said in one of his unmailed letters to . Perkins . " You say that you have been worried about my being able to control my vast masses of material . May I tell you that in the past year one of my chief and constantly growing anxieties has been whether I shall have any material left that I could use if you continue to advise against my present use of it . " His complaint had this much truth in it , that any sort of critical disapproval , even the mildest , was likely to shut off the " torrential reco/lectiveness , " as he called it , that was the basis ' of his literary activity . Yet even if nothing halted the flow of words , they came from a reservoir , not a river , and it might never be refilled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of his inspira ? tion , as many other writers have done . Reading the series of interviews with famous novelists that has been appear ? ing in The Paris Review , I have noticed that one after another speaks of his childhood as the basis of all his work , past and future . Said Francois Mauriac , for example , " It is as though when I was twenty -a door inside me had closed forever on that which was going to be ? come the material of my work . " Said Graham Greene , " The creative writer perceives his world once and for all in childhood and adolescence , and his whole career is an effort to illustrate his private world in terms of the great public world we all share . " C ONSIDERING his dependence on what he remembered , Wolfe was lucky that his adolescence , with its intense per ? ceptions , lasted much longer than it does with most writers . There are signs , however , that the common fate was overtaking him at the end , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less poignant . He was less interested in new adventures because , with the wisdom of approach ? ing middle age , he could foresee how they would end . More and more he would have been left to depend on other resources : on new combinations of remembered elements , on , skill and knowledge more than on pure sensa NOVEMBER 19 , 1956 tion . Turning his interests outward , he would have made ? the effort , in Greene 's phrase , " to illustrate his private world in terms of the great public world we all share . " W T did make that effort , but late in his career , and there is some question whether he would have suc ? ceeded in it even if he had lived . In his last project , as embodied in a manu ? script of , more than a million words which he turned over to Aswell before leaving for the Northwest ( and which Aswell piously edited after his death and published in two volumes and part of a third ) , he was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project is a failure as a whole . The big novel he planned had broken down into a series of episodes , some of them much better than others , but none quite on the level of his best early work . One of the weaker episodes , " The world That Jack Built , " printed on pages 149-322 of You Ca n't Go Home Again , is a fair-sized novel in ? itself . It is Wolfe 's version of the " big party , " attended by famous guests on the edge of bankruptcy , that has to be presented in every book about the 1920 's ? the going-to-pieces party that was described by Dos P.assos at the end of U.S.A. , by FitZgerald in Tender Is the Night , and , ill a Chicago Irish version , by Farrell in Studs Lonigan . The mention of those other names suggests how little Wolfe does by comparison in handling the same material , which was no longer quite his own . He writes about stock ? brokers and fashionable artists as if he had watched them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he tries ? to depict a contrasting world of servants and elevator operators , he falls into proletarian clich ? s . All his human values in the episode are not only wrong but coarsely and commonplacely wrong , and he had never acquired the technical skill that might have concealed his lack of sympathy . He was proud of " The World That Jack Built " ; at least he said he was proud , and even described it in a letter to Miss ' Nowell as being Proustian in its Scope ; but he must have at least a dim sense , of its failure . That would help to explain the bitterness toward others and the personal discouragement revealed in some of the shorter episodes written at about the same time . Perhaps the best of the late writing is the open letter to Fox Edwards ( or Max Perkins ) that is printed as a final chapter of You Ca n't Go Home Again . Here ? there is no bitterness and no attempt at objectivity ; Wolfe is talking about himself . He keeps asserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a valedic ? tory tone , as if he were saying goodbye to others besides his foster father and closest friend . At the very end he says : Dear Fox , old friend , thus we have come to the end of the road that we were to go together . My tale is fin ? ished ? and so farewell . But before I go I have one thing more to tell you : Something has spoken to me in the night , burning the tapers of the wan ? ing year ; something has spoken in the night , and told me I shall die , I know not where . Saying : " To lose the earth you know , for greater knowing ; to lose the life you have , for a greater life ; to leave the friends you loved , for greater loving ; to find a land more kind than home , more large than earth " ? Whereon the pillars of this earth are founded , toward which the con ? science of the world is tending ? a wind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been talking about his aspirations for a newer and better America ? that would be " the land . . . toward which the conscience of the world is tending " ? but at this final point his hopefulness became confused with another feeling , deep in himself , that his unwritten work would never be written , that his tale was ending in the only way it could end . At most the feeling was intermittent ; it was in con ? flict with other feelings , notably his determination to write more and more ; but ? at any moment of crisis or illness it would weaken his will to live . Death was not only the rest he never seemed to get ; it was a new adventure he was seeking , not altogether subconsciously . Like Baudelaire in his most ambitious poem , he thought of dying as taking a ship for unknown countries : 0 Death , old captain , it is time ! Raise anchor ! Out of the commonplace , 0 Death ! Set sail ! This other , and I think we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in part confirmed when we examine the careers of other writers who have 21 tried to live and work in the same tradi ? tion . There have indeed been others ; Wolfe was unprecedented , but he cre ? ated a precedent that younger men have tried to follow . I am not thinking of those who have imitated his unbuttoned style or echoed his hymns to the Amer ? ican earth ; at one time there were hun ? dreds of these hopeful disciples . More interesting are the other writers who were seized upon by ' Wolfe 's ambition to leave nothing unsaid , to possess a whole world by transforming it into words . There are not so many of these , because the ambition requires Wolfe 's vigor and his obsessive memory to be carried very far ; but a dozen or more have appeared in the last twenty years and each of them has written a long and rich novel about his coming of age or his native place . What did they do afterward ? I do n't like to mention their names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is brilliant or their future bright . That sort of writing is an intense strain on the author , and not many of the others have had Wolfe 's extraordinary stamina . Some of the younger men have already died or had nervous or alcoholic breakdowns , or have lapsed into inferior work . One name safer to mention is that of Ross Lockridge , author of Raintree County , a novel of 1,066 pages crowded with characters and incidents ; critics complained that nothing was left out . The book had a popular success that Lockridge did not live to enjoy , for ? we read in the supplement to Twentieth Century Authors , . the strain of many years work on the book began to show . An intense man , burning with what a friend described as " a boyish enthusiasm that never relaxes , " he suffered a nervous breakdown . In March of 1948 , only two months after his book was pub ? lished , and only ? a few weeks before his thirty-fourth birthday , he commit ? ted suicide . OLFE outlived him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his books will outlive those by his younger follow ers . Reading these letters that record his career from the beginning , one feels a new respect for his integrity and his single-minded devotion to his work . He had always dreamed of becoming a hero , and that is how he impresses us now ? perhaps not as a hero of the literary art , but as a tragic hero of the act of writing .
