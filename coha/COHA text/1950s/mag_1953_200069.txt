Among the Misri Effendis , the long-suffering John Does of Egypt , there were some who framed the likeness of President Naguib in their mud homes by the Nile , or sought to touch his clothes as he passed by . There were others more concerned with the fact that loaves were smaller , sugar more costly and wages no higher than they were when the President came to power a year ago . When Naguib gave 853 lucky fellahin the deeds to some of the rich man 's land , the new landowners were gleeful and gay for the photographers ( who are always on hand for such moments ) . But they also wondered when they could move to their own land , how much the plots would cost , how they would like the new cooperative that would tell them what to plant , how to take their goods to market . " Mohammed Naguib is a good man , " it was said in the villages . " He will give us everything soon . " Others were still skeptical in a land whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Week . Last week Egypt celebrated the first anniversary of Naguib 's " Blessed Movement " in fine , military style . For two hours , crisp recruits tramped down Cairo 's tapestried streets , while helicopters scattered Naguib posters from above . Next day 4,000 Liberation Rally guerrillas snapped past beneath their death's-head emblem , and later chanted Allah Akhbar , Allah Akhbar . Then paratroops , Egypt 's first , jumped into Heliopolis race track . " We have the means , " cried Naguib , " to throw the British out of the Canal Zone any time we want . " At 11:05 on Liberation night , the time the army moved last year against King Farouk , 101 guns boomed across the brooding Nile . Four hours later , a great crowd gathered with Naguib to hear the muezzin chant familiar verses from the Koran . Then , as the sun came up , they knelt in humility with their faces towards Mecca . <P> The Year . For the dedicated Ruling Twelve of the Revolutionary Command Council ( RCC ) , for Naguib , its elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamal Abdel Nasser , its spark and driving power , it had been a good year . King Farouk , the monarchy , the political parties and the corruption had gone . Land reform was coming , confused but coming . Crops were good , and cotton exports were up one-third over last year . But the green young army officers of the RCC had no easy solution for Egypt 's basic problem : overpopulation . Egypt 's people , by doubling their number in the past 50 years , have made the narrow green belt along the Nile one of the most densely populated areas on earth . On the inflammable subject of the Suez Canal , the young officers have frequently sunk to old-style rabble-rousing , only to show a welcome moderation at crucial moments . Naguib and his fellow officers have also shown themselves devout Moslems without creating a theocratic state : Naguib astonished his Arab neighbors by sending greetings to the Egyptian Jews at Passover . <P> To celebrate their first anniversary , the Ruling Twelve invited 81 newspapermen from 49 countries . The visitors could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way from the unmourned era of Farouk , but still had a long way to go .
