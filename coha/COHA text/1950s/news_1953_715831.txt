txt The orphaned International Longshoremen 's Association took over Madison Square Garden last night to show its muscles in public . Expelled a month ago by the American Federation of Labor for failing to rid itself of racketeer control , the pier union massed 15,000 strong , counting its womenfolk , in New York 's main prizefight arena . The rally had a twofold purpose . The union 's top leaders , including vice presidents from other East Coast and Gulf ports , denounced Governor Dewey as a " dictator " and protested the COMpulsory registration of waterfront labor , required by Dec. 1 under state law . They also hurled defiance at the new union chartered by the A. F. L. to wrest jurisdiction over pier workers from Joseph P. Ryan , I. L. A. president , and other union bosses whose doings had been exposed by the state crime commission . Ryan is awaiting trial on charges of theft of union funds . Union Irmo a Point Last night 's demonstration followed by a few hours a tactical advantage won by Ryan 's union in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. A. ' 3 invitation to resume contract negotiations tomorrow . The A. F. L. immediately denounced the employers willingness to deal with the old I. L. A. while a National Labor Relations Board election between the rival unions is pending as a " violation of the Taft-Hartley Law " and indicated that a complaint of unfair labor practices would be filed with the board . The labor board , meanwhile , called for a meeting of representatives of both unions and the employers at its regional office , 2 Park Avenue , at 10:30 A.M. today to discuss procedures for the election . A peaceful parade of longshore7 men from the piers along the North River to Madison Square Garden and an hour of vaudeville preceded the fighting speeches . The parade started at Pier 74 , at Thirty-fourth Street , and moved northward along Twelfth Avenue behind two bands and a drill team // of blue-uniformed girls from St. Michael 's Roman Catholic Church , Jersey City . As the procession hove alongside the piers , fresh contingents fell into line . Members of the A. F. L. lunion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration , made good the promise . A detail of 350 policemen along the parade route and about the Garden had nothing to do except detour ' vehicular traffic . Ryan , who was loudly cheered when he mounted the platform at 8:30 P. M. , told the gathering ? nearly half women  --  that he was greatly moved by the demonstration of longshoremen " and their families to protest the outrage that they ca n't have the right to have the organization they choose to belong to . " The ** president , who left the hospital last week , told the crowd he had been advised by his doctor to remain at home . Therefore , he said , he was turning over the rest of the meeting to Patrick J. ( Packy ) Connolly , international executive vice president . Mr. Connolly quickly roused the Ryan followers to volleys of boos as he assailed David Beck , head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , A. F. L. , and Paul Hall , East Coast leader of the Seafarers International Union , who are directing the A. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came when he accused Governor Dewey and Gov . Alfred E. Driscoll of New Jersey of having foisted upon labor " state hiring halls which will be run by politicians . " Mr. Connolly said Mr. Hall and other " characters " , were " telling everyone they are going to take over the I. L. A. even if they have to do it with baseball bats . " " Let ' em come ; we 'll be ready for them , " a voice from the gallery shouted . " Let me give these seamen a bit of advice , " Mr. Connolly went on . " We were Dorn and raised on the waterfront . We doubt anyone can blowy in from nowhere and bust us up . " Warns Longshoremen Mr. Connolly warned the longshoremen that if any were " foolish enough to sign up with Hall and Beck " they would be relegated to " second class " union status and find themselves " in the Teamsters Union or a longshore division of the Seafarers Union instead of a longshore union of their own . " Attacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mugs who beat their wives , " Mr. Connolly said the newspapers were now turning to exposures of racketeering in harness racing . He said the exposures already had shown " some ( pretty big A. F. L. leaders " involved in race track rackets . . - Mr . Connolly denounced , pint by point , the regulations of the New York-New Jersey Waterfront Commission and said legal experts had told the union there was " a good chance " that the waterfront control legislation " can be thrown out " by the courts . Mr. Connolly announced that the I. L. A. would hold a special convention Nov. 16 in Philadelphia to take up the problems resulting from its expulsion from the A. F. L. and the threat of the new union . Capt . William Bradley , head of the tugboat workers division of the I. L. A. , who has beet men- , tioned as a possible successor to the international presidency if Ryan should resign , asserted that " if there 's any house-cleaning to be done , we can do it ourselves . " Captain Bradley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can to hold the I. L. A. together and give you a clean-union . " Anthony ( Tough Tony ) Anastasia , labor boss of the Brooklyn piers , drew a great shout after his half-minute speech . In fervent and broken English , he exclaimed : " I stay with you till I die , " John J. ( Gene ) Sampson , who resigned as business agent of Local 791 to join the new union and others who have defected from the Ryan camp were branded " traitors " and booed almost as roundly as Governor Dewey . The front rows were speckled with placards of delegations from Boston , Baltimore and other ports and with American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars caps . The crowd was enthusiastic and responsive , but it was clear that most of them had come chiefly to be seen by their pier bosses and to listen to Ryan . After Ryan 's brief appearance , the crowd began to thin out and within half an hour had dwindled to 5,000 . By 10 o'clock and the twelfth speaker , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rev. Raymond P. Waldron , assistant pastor of St. Michael 's Church , came into the hall with Ryan . Msgr . John J. O'Donnell , pastor of the Shrine Church of the Sea , blessed the rally and prayed that God bestow " a special blessing on the men who labor along the waterfront and help them to find a peaceful solution for their difficulties . " A prayer was said also by Rabbi Max Felshin of the Radio City Synagogue . Negotiation Meeting Tomorrow John V. Lyon , chairman of the Shipping Association , which includes 170 shipping and stevedore companies , announced that the association 's sixteen-man negotiating committee would meet tomorrow with the I. L. A. 's contract committee . He said the negotiations would take place at the association offices , 80 Broad Street , starting at - 11 A. M. Mr. Lyon said the association committee had decided at a meeting yesterday morning to accept the invitation sent Friday by Mr. Connolly for resumption of contract talks .

In Kings County Court , John Mangiameli , 48 years old , of 40 Gates Avenue , Valley Stream , L. I. , was held in $2,500 bail on a thirty-nine-count indictment charging grand larcency , petit lar- ' ceny and forgery in connection with his duties as financial secretary of Local 338 of the I. L. A. He pleaded not guilty before Judge Samuel S. Liebowitz . No trial date was set . Mangiameli allegedly stole $1,000 between Oct. 19 , 1951 , and March 31 , 1952 , by making false entries of dues paid by the local 's 1,000 members .
