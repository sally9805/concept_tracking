Like soldiers everywhere , Communist Czechoslovakia 's troops enjoy getting letters from their girls. * Last week Czechoslovakia 's Military Enlightenment Officer attempted to take all the joy out of mail call . " The stuff you used to write your girls , " he told the soldiers , " is not proper for a member of the people 's democratic army . " Instead of " vain talk of love , " he continued , " you must tell your girls about the experience of being built into new human beings for service in a new and stronger people 's army . Tell them to write you about their experiences as tractor drivers , factory hands or members of the collective farms . If your girl friend will prove her truthfulness and determination on the economic battlefront and you on the battlefield , there will grow from this bond the new kind of love . . . " <P> In future , he added , soldiers ' love letters would be censored . <P> <P> * In Korea last week , the fighting men of the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than 1,000,000 letters had accumulated for the leathernecks as they sailed along Korea 's coast , waiting for the delayed landing at Wonsan . When the letters were doled out in what was probably the biggest mail call in the Corps ' history , one marine expressed relief . Clutching a bundle of letters , he shouted : " They still love me-all six of them . "
