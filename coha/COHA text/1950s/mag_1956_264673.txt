THE SOUND OF WAVES ( 183 pp. ) - Yuklo Mishima-Knopf ( $3 ) . <P> <P> A Japanese novel is rather like a Japanese flower arrangement . It is subtle , delicate and personal , and it invariably fades a little in the vase of translation . The Sound of Waves does not wholly escape this fate , but its 31-year-old author , Yukio Mishima , is a spare-time weight lifter , and he has infused his tale of troubled young love among hard-working fisherfolk with a peasant robustness notably lacking in recent , more aristocratically attuned Japanese novels , e.g. , Lady of Beauty , Some Prefer Nettles . <P> The men on tiny Uta-jima ( Song Island ) fish for octopus . The women dive in the numbing offshore waters for abalone . The islanders ' lives are far from a song . But when they rise from the earthen floors of the dark , dank-smelling huts , they see the morning sun dancing on the sea , and stately clouds crossing the horizon " like ancient gods . " Teen-age Shinji is content to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to nature . When he prays in the garden of the Yashiro shrine , he asks , " God , let the seas be calm , the fish plentiful , and ... in time let me become a fisherman among fishermen . " <P> A girl takes his mind off his prayers . Hatsue is lithe and lovely , the winner among the women divers of an unofficial " best-shaped breasts " contest . A fleeting kiss on the beach is about all Shinji can hope for from Hatsue , since her father is a wealthy shipowner with small use for penniless apprentice fishermen . Author Mishima , who seems to have learned some of his flower-arranging from Hollywood , maroons the couple in an abandoned tower during a storm . <P> Drenched to the skin , they dry out their clothes before a roaring fire and very nearly burn the last social bridge between them . Village gossip assumes the worst , and Hatsue 's father plays the ogre . In the popular Japanese tradition , true love of this kind is expected to end badly , preferably with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or into a volcano . Novelist Mishima resolutely avoids the bucket-of-tears finale for an imitation Western happy ending , which will startle readers by its incongruity . But love in Japan is not so much the book 's real subject as love of Japan . The desire to evoke the spare , printlike beauty of their native land which animates Author Mishima and other leading Japanese novelists sets them apart as a special and welcome breed in contemporary writing-that of unabashed patriot esthetes who somehow manage not to sound like jingoes.
