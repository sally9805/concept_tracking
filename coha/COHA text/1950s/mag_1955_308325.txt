France 's new Premier Edgar Faure has set himself a characteristic goal : to steer a middle course between Mends-France 's contentious boldness and the do-nothingism of Mends ' predecessors . " I know people will talk about my having a small appetite , " he said . " I do n't eat everything in sight . I nibble . " * <P> Last week Edgar Faure nibbled successfully at the budget , which has been hanging fire in the Assembly for three months . The Socialists , whose main business in life is looking after the government fonctionnaires , were demanding all-round increases of $371 million . Faure , who had offered a mere $137 million , smiled and upped the ante to $164 million . In an atmosphere of almost dizzying good will , Faure won his first Assembly vote , 364 to 242 . <P> In the Senate , Faure pushed ahead with a headache inherited from Mends : the vital Paris accords . The Senate has no veto power , but by an unfavorable vote , or even by tacking on an amendment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another debate and another vote , a laborious business that might prove lethal . Faure was determined to get the accords approved " without amendment and without delay . " <P> To carry his fight in the Senate , Faure relied on his Foreign Minister , Antoine Pinay , the small-businessman 's Premier for ten months in 1952 . Pinay is no specialist in foreign affairs , but he boned up fast , and made an able 2-hour speech . <P> If France does not approve the accords , said Pinay , it will be dangerously isolated . To prove his point he produced a letter from Sir Winston Churchill , saying that if France left her place vacant at international councils , " sooner or later another nation meaning West Germany would take her chair . " Pinay 's case was further bolstered by a message from President Eisenhower , giving assurance that U.S. forces would stay in Europe " while a threat to that area exists . " This important U.S. guarantee had been given during the EDC struggle , but it had lapsed with the death of EDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get the Senate to begin debate on March 22 . The fixing of an early date is a favorable augury for ratification . <P> * A remark reminiscent of Marshal Joseph ( " Papa " ) Joffre 's first attempt to deal with the deadlock on the Western Front in World War I. Said he amiably , " Je les grignote " ( I am nibbling them ) .
