Other movie companies can sell out to television and other moviemen can collect the fast bucks that come from making TV quickies . But at 20th Century-Fox , President Spyros P. Skouras clings to the old-fashioned notion that Hollywood ought to make lots of money by making lots of movies . Last week he announced that 20th is driving ahead on one of the biggest shooting schedules in its history : 60 pictures in production , with another 28 screenplays ready for the cameras . Among $20 million worth of pictures to be released before the end of 1959 : William Faulkner 's Requiem for a Nun , the French farce Palate , and a sexy shocker . The Chapman Report . <P> Next year 's budget will be another whopper : 20th will make 40 pictures worth $60 million , among them The Greatest Story Ever Told , John Brown 's Body and The Battle of Leyte Gulf .
