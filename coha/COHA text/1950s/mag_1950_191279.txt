When the work was completed , church leaders described it as " one of the most historic events in American Christianity . " For four days last week 600 delegates and 3,000 observers had threaded their way to &; from Cleveland 's Public Auditorium through shoulder-high embankments of leftover snow , to found a new organization that will represent non-Roman Catholic Christianity as it has never been represented before in the U.S. <P> Pooled Ideas . The new organization is called the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. Nine years in the making , it is a merger of the most important Protestant and Eastern Orthodox agencies in the U.S. One of them , the Federal Council of Churches , was itself a federation of 27 religious bodies with 29 million members ; the seven others were interdenominational agencies organized for specific purposes . Their names : the International Council of Religious Education , the Foreign Missions Conference of North America , the Missionary Education Movement of the United States and Canada , the Home Missions Council of North America , the Protestant Council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council of Church Women . <P> Purpose of the new overall body is to pool the best ideas and techniques each group has to offer , and to confront the world with an immensely more powerful united voice . The combination will also save money .

Through these divisions the council 's impact will be felt in 150,000 Protestant and Orthodox member churches ( the two large U.S. denominations to remain outside are the Southern Baptist Convention and the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church ) . <P> Effective Procedures . The council 's first president : handsome , 60-year-old Bishop Henry Knox Sherrill , Presiding Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church , to which post he was elected in 1947-one of the youngest men ever so honored . A longtime leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherrill seemed a natural choice to head the new superagency .

Treasurer : General Electric 's President Charles E. Wilson . As operating head , with the title of general secretary , the delegates elected Dr. Samuel McCrea Cavert , who has held the same job at the Federal Council of Churches since 1921 . <P> To U.N . ' s Secretary General Trygve Lie , during U.N . ' s most nerve-racked week , the delegates wired their belief that " war is not inevitable , " adding that the council was praying that the U.N . " may find just and effective procedures for containing and resolving the conflict in Korea . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
