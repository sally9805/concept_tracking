txt KARACHI , Pakistan , Feb. 6 ? Pakistan is more a geographical expression than a nation . The idea of a separate , Moslem state in India was invented by a poet . It received political backing from the independence movement only in 1940 ? seven years before the British pulled olt . But there is no Pakistani- people . The word , which also means " Land of the Pure , " derives from an anagram based on territorial provinces . P is for Punjab ; A is for the Afghan Pathans of the North-West Frontier ; K is for Kashmir ; S is for Sind ; Tan is for Baluchistan : Significantly , I there is no reference to East Bengal . Yet it is in that area , one - thousand miles away on the other side of India , that most Pakistanis live . This anagrammatic origin may yet symbolize Pakistan 's ultimate development . Karachi covets K for Kashmir  --  of which it holds but a minor chunk . There are those who think of A for Afghanistan in larger terms than Pathans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is nothing serious to this project now . The Afghans are playing a dangerous double game , courting the Russians and trying to promote Pathan insurrection in Pakistan . Karachi has suggested that they at least pursue a common policy in economics , defense and foreign affairs . The response , in terms of acts , is negative . Latent Trouble Suspected Most of Karachi 's attention has thus been focused northward toward Kashmir and Afghanistan . Too little is perhaps devoted to East Pakistan ? East Bengal  --  which does n't even figure in the national anagram . Yet latent centrifugal forces there may eventually produce trouble . This is a curiously dual state with most of its area concentrated in the Middle East and most of its population in Southeast Asia . With no overland connection across India , a tiny , obsolesbent merchant fleet and fledgling airline , this odd position is difficult to maintain . The official view is that the idea of an independent East Bengal would- be ridiculous ; that it would be gobbled up by India . But at present fear of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and West together . The coalition that won East Pakistan 's elections used the slogan " Bengal for the Bengalis . " The role , of Bengali politicians is not clear . Prime Minister Mohammed Ali comes from the area but barely speaks its language . Law Minister Suhrawardy , currently the most powerful Bengali , stands for national unity . But the province 's popular leader , Maulana Bhashani , labeled a Communist and - now a refugee in India , does n't . Another renowned . politico , Fazlui Huq , is an outright secessionist . Some day Pakistan 's unity will be tested . Its ultimate strength may depend upon a handful of leaders more than communality of interest . A very few exceptional men have distinguished Karachi so far from ordinary Middle Eastern capitals . But Jinnah , the nation 's patron saint , is dead . Liaquat An Khan was assassinated , Ghulam Mohammed , present Governor General , is ailing and half paralyzed , sustained only by an indomitable will . Few other Pakistani statesmen are of this caliber . Mohammed Ali , the Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has great energy and is , incidentally , a devoted admirer of the United States . But he is no national magnet . Perhaps the ablest Cabinet member is Chaudhri Mohammed Ali , Minister of Finance . He is highly intelligent and wise enough to observe , " Democracy is an ideal to be aspired after and worked for ; but it can never be perfectly , achieved . " Limited Democracy Advocated Less philosophical perhaps is a small but powerful faction within the dominant hierarchy which believes in ' a period of " controlled democracy " under some local version of Turkey 's Kemal Ataturk . The only visible candidate for such a role is Maj. Gen. Iskander Mirza , Interior . Minister , whose son recently married the American Ambassador 's daughter . Mirza feels that if democracy goes off the rails  --  as it has threatened ' to do here  --  a strong hand must put it back . He tried the experiment successfully when he restored order from chaos in East Bengal . He is tough , intelligent and Western-minded . The first Indian cadet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point , lie worked twenty-eight years in British India 's political service . He headed Pakistan 's defense system . Colorful enough to attract legend , . Mirza supposedly forestalled a riot once by having his agents mix purgatives in the plotters ' rice . He offends Islam 's fanatical priests , the Mullahs , by warning religion out of politics . He proclaims , " We ca n't run wild on Islam , it 's Pakistan first and last . " One of his officer supporters broke up a mob by ordering troops : " Shoot to kill and aim at beards . " Mullahs wear beards . Whether Pakistan will shelve democracy in favor of a " strong hand " remains to be seen . There is no doubt that this country , which leans into both the Middle East and Southeast Asia , inherits political weaknesses from each . Nevertheless , it has displayed considerable energy , imagination and determination during its difficult youth . It has managed to produce a very few remarkably able men . The future will depend largely upon the quality of their leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
