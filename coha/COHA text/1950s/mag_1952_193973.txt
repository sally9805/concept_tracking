For many generations Ichiro Ishikawa 's ancestors had lived in Ueno , a remote , semifeudal village in Shizuoka prefecture . Ueno 's rich , black volcanic soil yielded rice , corn , sweet potatoes and garden vegetables . There were nightingales , cuckoos , profusely blooming wild chrysanthemums ; and , in summer , gorgeous swarms of red dragonflies . Life in Ueno was good . <P> Ballots v. Fireworks . Yet Ichiro Ishikawa had troubles . Once he had owned more than three acres of forest land , paddies and dry rice field . The U.S. occupiers had taken his woodland for SCAP 's land reform program . Then , in drinking and gambling on flower cards , Ichiro had lost all but half an acre of the rice land . He had to hire out to other villagers . Still , he had a docile , hard-working wife and three fine daughters , of whom his special pride was the middle one , Satsuki ( May Moon ) . May Moon , plump , smart and 17 , was an honor student at the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Goethe , De Maupassant , Wilde and Gide . <P> Recently , the people of Ueno were called on to vote ( in a by-election ) for a representative in the upper house of Japan 's Diet . On election day there was also a fireworks display at a nearby Shinto shrine . The local political boss canvassed the villagers , asked those who wanted to see the fireworks to hand over their admission tickets to the polls , so that Ueno might still have a patriotically large number of ballots cast . In one ward a bulletin was circulated demanding that people who did not intend to vote bring their tickets to the ward leader 's house . Some women who voted for the right candidate were allowed to vote five times . <P> Scandal v. Scorn . Ichiro Ishikawa 's wife Kimiko. who went proudly forth to cast her ballot as one of Japan 's newly enfranchised women , reported these scandalous goings-on to her family . They did not correspond to what May Moon had learned in her civics books . So May Moon wrote an indignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Government investigators moved into Ueno . <P> The people of Ueno felt that dishonor had fallen on the village , but that May Moon , not they , had caused it . The cold silence of mura-hachibu enveloped the family , a severe form of ostracism in which no one will speak to the victims or aid them except in case of fire or funeral . No one would lend Ichiro tools and he could get no work . But he did not blame his daughter , and she did not blame the villagers . " The chiefs had told them that the village should cast many votes and would not be dishonored , " said May Moon . " This is indeed a rural tragedy . " <P> Added her mother : " It is very difficult . Of what joy are the songs of cuckoos and nightingales when one 's friends are silent and their faces are stiff with scorn ? "
