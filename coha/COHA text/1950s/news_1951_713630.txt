District Attorney Frank S. Hogan said they had admitted receiving sums up to $1,500 each for " fixing " three Madison Square Garden contests in the current season . In each case they were supposed to lose or to keep the margin of victory below the pointspread that City College was favored by in advance betting . City lost all three games . Taken into custody when they returned with Coach Nat Holman and the remainder of the squad from a record-setting victory over Temple University at Philadelphia on Saturday night , the three  --  Cocaptains Ed Roman and Ed Warner , and Al Roth  --  were questioned all night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's payoffs , Mr. Hogan said .

Mr. Hogan said Schaff had attempted to line up a teammate at N. Y. U. for the gambler , but had been rebuffed . Later , Robert Sabatini , 60 , of 25 Central Park West , was held as a material witness . Mr. Hogan described Sabatini as " a person who had gambling contacts " with Sollazzo . The prosecutor said he had " no information " to the effect that Sollazzo 's address , 115 Central Park West , was the same apartment building in which Frank Costello is a tenant . The prosecutor , in disclosing the details of the latest college basketball scandal , the implications of which , because of the wholesale briberies , seemed to reach deeper than the earlier isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools mentioned or to other players . Arraigned last night before , Chief Magistrate John M. Murtagh in Felony Court , Sollazzo was held without bail . He was excoriated by the Chief Magistrate as one who " appears to have corrupted these young men and brought disgrace on a great institution . " Mr. Murtagh mentioned that he himself was an alumnus of City College . $15,000 Bail for 3 Players Bail of $15,000 each was set for the City College players . despite pleas by attorneys for Roman and Roth for a lower figure . Bail for Schaff was fixed at $10,000 . All four later posted bonds and were ? eleased . Gard , after giving his consent , was remanded to the custody of Acting Capt . William Grafnecker , head of the District Attorney 's police squad . Attendants relieved the three players of the zipper bags that held the basketball uniforms they had worn in the Temple contest , returning them after the arraignment . The City College youths appeared abashed and nervous during the proceedings , while Sollazzo seemed worried but slightly defiant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was read in court , saying that a conviction for armed robbery should have read unarmed robbery , but Mr. Murtagh said he was not concerned with the " correction . " The six first arrested had been booked at the Elizabeth Street sta. - tion and later fingerprinted and , " mugged " at Police Headquarters. , They made the rounds on foot , winding up at the Criminal Courts , Building on : Center Street . A Sunday crowd of strollers , fell in behind . the detectives and the small army of reporters and photographers as they trooped through the streets . Sabatini was arraigned privately before General Sessions Judge // John A. Mullen at the jurists ' home , where bail of $ ? 35,000 weal set . Announcing the round-up and disclosing details of the gambler 's operations , Mr. Hogan said Sollazzo 's record showed an arrest on a grand larceny charge on Jan. 24 , 1931 , which was dismissed by the grand - jury ; an arrest for armed 1 robbery on Nov. 11 , 1932 , with a conviction and sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State 's Prison on Jan. 31 , 1933 ; and a third arrest , apparently be , ' fore he began to serve his sentence ! or while he was free on bail , on a grand larceny charge in- eonnecI tion with a jewelry theft on Dec. 22 , 1932 .. On this charge Sollazzo was sentenced on March 8 , 1934 , to from one year and eight months to three years in State 's Prison . The prosecutor caned the roll on the others arrested . Edward Gard , 23 , of 799 Avenue Z , Brooklyn , is a senior at Long Island University and a former member of its basketball team ; 1his eligibility for playing was completed last year . Edward Roman , 120 , of 1372 Teller Avenue , the , Bronx ; Alvin Roth , 21 , of 480 Montgomery Street , Brooklyn , and Edward L. Warner , 21 , of 44 West 135th Street , all of whom are juniors at City , College and members of both the current squad and the championship team of last season . Harvey ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brooklyn , is a junior at N. Y. U. ; he was a substitute on the basketball team early in the season and developed into a leading scorer . Sollazzo and Gard were charged with giving a bribe ; the three City College players with having received bribes from them , and Schaff with offering.a bribe to influence James Brasco , an N. Y. U. basketball player , to " fix " the N. Y. U.-St . Francis College game last Jan. 30 , Mr. Hogan said . All were charged with a violation ' of Section 382 of the Penal Law , which is headed , " Bribery of Participants in ' Professional or Amateur Games . " The penalties range up to one to five years in prison and a maximum fine of $10 , - 000 , or both . Mr. Hogan 's recital was the culmination of a month of intensive labor by twenty detectives on his staff , the spectacular arrests having been precipitated  --  four or five days before the trap was to be sprung ? by piecemeal and premature disclosures published late Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City College , with its leading players , members of the team that had won both the National Invitation Tournament at Madison Square Garden and the National Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament in the 1949-50 season could amass a record of only eleven games won and seven lost for the 1950-51 season . It disclosed a brazen attempt , laid to Sollazzo and possibly unidentified associates , to " fix " as many outstanding members of as many leading metropolitan college basketball teams as money could buy . These attempts met with success in the case of the three City College stars , but Mr. Brasco spurned the offer . They began , Mr. Hogan said , when Sollazzo entertained , Gard and other players at , a sum , mer hotel in the Catskills , where college basketball players from over the country earn side money , in the off-season by working at various jobs and play in an unofficial " borscht circuit " league . " We , suspect Sollazzo went there for this purpose , " Mr. Hogan said . An invitation ' to Gard to visit Sollazzo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present school year , the prosecutor , . There Sollazzo assertedly broached . the possibility of Gard 's , going to ' other players and inducing them to " fix games . " Gard , who had known Roth since they both played basketball in high school , sounded him out and found him agreeable , Mr. Hogan said . Shortly . thereafter , the prosecutor continued , Roman was approached and agreed to visit Sollazzo 's home with Roth after a game in the Garden . This was about the beginning of December . Two Players Approached At this meeting Sollazzo reportedly told the two City College players that they " could make a lot of money " if they agreed to go along with " fixing " scores . He said , according to Mr. Hogan , that he would bet . substantial sums and promised to cut the players in on the " sure things " they would make on the " fixes . " They told him , Mr. Hogan said , they would think it over and let him know . Later they expressed concern that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might detect their failure to feed the ball on scoring plays to the star forward , that Warner might go to Coach Holman , and " that would be the end of them if Holman got a whisper of it . " JAILED GAMBLER Salvatore T. Sollazzo They received permission from Sollazzo to approach Warner , who , according to the prosecutor , agreed to the deal . Three games were " fixed , " Mr. Hogan said . These were the City College contests with Missouri on Dec. 9 , with Arizona University on Dec. 28 , and with Boston College on last ' Jan. 11 . All were played in Madison Square Garden . In each game City College was an eight-to-twelve point favorite in ' the betting . The " fix " was for the City stars to keep their margin of victory down to no more than six points , Mr. Hogan said . They did better than ? that ; they saw to it that their team was beaten in all three games . Each of the three " fixed " players allegedly received $1,500 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-seven points not many more points than any one of the three players ? was capable of scoring  --  and Missouri amassed the winning total of fifty-four . For the Arizona " fix , " which Arizona won , 41 to 38 , each of the three received $1,000 , The agreement on the Boston College game , won by B. C. , 63 to 59 , was that Roth and Roman were to get $1,000 each , Mr. Hogan said . Warner hurt his knee shortly before Chat game and was unable to play , but Sollazzo , according to the prosecutor , said he would give Warner $500 . The gambler paid Roth only $1,400 , and " welched " completely on his promises to Roman and Warner , Mr. Hogan said . They were still trying to collect , he disclosed , when the arrests were made . ? Bonuses in Other Games Payments sometimes were made by Sollazzo and sometimes by Gard , Mr. Hogan said . In addition to the payments in the three ' games , Sollazzo made " good will " offerings as bonuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were not fixed . Thus Roth and Roman each received $500 for , the Washington State game and , $250 ' apiece for the St. John 's , game . Both were played at the Garden , ' C. C. N. Y. winning the Wastfington State game , 59 to 43 , on Dec. , 14 , and losing to St. John 's University , in which it was the underdog , 44 to 47 , on Jan. 2 . At least one of the City College players involved had wagered all or part of the money he received from Sollazzo on his own team in the Washington State game , Mr. Hogan said , but the prosecutor stressed that neither this game nor the St. John 's contest was " fixed . " 1 Gard introduced Schaff to S61-la , zo , who wanted him to " work on " the N. Y. U. team , Mr. Hogan revealed , but the gambler was not satisfied with Schaff as a " fix , " holding that he was not good enough to " deliver . " This was early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told him he could " do himself some good " on the St. Francis game . The player said he would have no part of a bribe. 1 Mr. Brasco was questioned and fully cleared by the prosecutor 's office . He received a subpoena to I testify before the grand jury today , but it was said he might not be called before Wednesday . All Schaff received from Sollazzo , Mr. Hogan said , was a handout of $20 or $30 on occasions and I some free " entertainment . " Gard 's graft from Sollazzo was not disclosed , but Assistant District At ' torney Vincent -A . G. O'Connor , who stayed up all night conducting the questioning , said he understood there was a " working arrangement " on the amount ahat Sollazzo bet on the games . How much the gambler bet on the fixed games was still being investigated . The prosecutor disclosed that his inquiry had stemmed from a " tip , " which said in effect that the tipster was suspicious of a certain person . With that , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps of detectives , whom he praised highly , proceeded to " break the ease . " " I want to make this plain , " Mr. Hogan told reporters . " It has been for me and the men ' who worked with me a most disagreeable and sickening business . There is no joy of accomplishment . I fervently wish that any person who might be so tempted could have seen , as we did , these stupid and dishonest young men when they admitted their guilt . " Tears , remorse , self-reproach , scalding thoughts and the perpetual heartaches their disgrace will cause mother and father and loved ones  --  all of this too late . It just makes you wonder what has happened to our moral values . The entire business is loathsome and pathetic . " Detectives Saw Game Without disclosing their identities , Detectives Abraham Belsky and George Jaeger of the District Attorney 's staff attended the C. C. N. Y.-Temple game on Saturday night , which City College won by the top-heavy score of 95 to 71 . They came back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reached New York . Mr. Holman , who was voted the outstanding basketball coach last year , told his " boys " to tell the truth ; if they had anything on their consciences , they would feel better about it . At about midnight the three youths were brought to Center Street for the night-long questioning . Detective Belsky is the uncle of David Shapiro , a George Washington ' University player who reported a bribe attempt to Mr. Hogan in December , 1949 . Cann " Proud " of Brasco Dr. Harry N. Wright , president ' of City College , would make no formal comment , but indicated the disclosures were totally unexpected . Dr. Sam Winograd , faculty manager of athletics , said he was " shocked and bewildered . " He is to meet with Dr. Wright at the president 's office this morning . I Coach Howard Cann of New York University said he was " very proud " of Mr. Brasco , but was " shocked " to learn of Schaff 's involvement . " I think it was a fine thing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad that there is no evidence that any N , Y. U. game was fixed . " Coach Clair Bee of L. I. U. expressed " shock " at Gard 's pgrt in the fixing . " I 'm awfully disappointed in Eddie , " he said . Ned Irish , executive vice president and basketball director of Madison Square Garden , who'popularized the sport in the Garden , said he had ho comment . At his Mine in Princeton , N. Asa Bushnell , commissioner of ; the Eastern College Athletic Conference and chairman of the selection committee for the National Invitation Tournament , also said , . , " no comment . " Walter , director of athletics at St. John 's University , and president of the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Basketball Association , sponsor of , the tournament , said he assumed it would proceed as scheduled .

He:is an orphan who was brought up by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warner as a player , is a brilliant student and a candidate for Phi Beta Kappa . All three were members of an outstanding freshman team and played brilliantly as sophomores as the 1949-50 season progressed . Regarded as the " step-child " of the post-season tournaments , the City 1College team defeated all oppo1stion . Under Senate Investigation WASHINGTON , Feb. 18 ( UP ) ? Senator Estes Kefauver , Democrat of Tennessee , revealed tonight that the Senate Crime Committee , of which he is chairman , had been investigating New York 's basketball fix " for , some time . " ' Lie committee , he said , probably will make known additional details of the scandal when it holds pun. ; hearings in New York soon . Mr. Kefauver said the . committee 's information indicated the operation apparently was tiadain with other gambling activities that had come to the group 's attention .
