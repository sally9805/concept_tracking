DISASTERS Locked Controls Rudders , ailerons and elevators of grounded aircraft will flap in the wind unless they are kept rigidly locked . Until planes got too big , it was easy enough to walk around outside one after a landing and slip wooden battens over the control surfaces-and to take them off before taxiing out to the runway . But the wings and tails of many modern transports can not be reached from the ground ; rudders present so much surface to a cross wind , moreover , that pilots often find it necessary to keep them locked while taxiing. release them just before a takeoff . Most big planes , as a result , now have built-in locking systems operated from the cockpit . <P> To lock all controls on the Air Force 's enormous double-decked troop-carrying C124 Globemasters , pilots have to pull up a knob on the throttle pedestal . To release them before a takeoff , it is necessary to push the knob down past four notches : the throttles are freed at the first notch , the ailerons are unlocked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevators at the fourth . Last week , searching through the wreckage of the Globemaster at Moses Lake , Wash. , in which 87 servicemen died ( TIME , Dec. 29 ) , investigators found its locking panel-and the plain cause of the crash . The knob had n't been pushed past the second notch . <P> It was only possible to conclude that the crash was the result of tragic negligence on the part of the pilot . He had gone down the runway with rudder and elevators still locked up . The plane took off . and went into a steep climb . In the minute after it was airborne , probably the pilot tried to get the nose down , found to his horror that the controls were rigid , perhaps even grabbed for the knob at his right knee . But by then the Globemaster had stalled , had crashed and was being hammered into blazing wreckage on the hard desert floor .
