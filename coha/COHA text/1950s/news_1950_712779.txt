txt Spring has arrived and New York City has little reason ftzr self-coneratulation on its water supply . Yesterday the reservoirs were at 53.4 per cent or capacity. - A year ago they stood at 92.6 per cent , and at the end of April , 1949 , were filled aid overflowing . The winter 's rains and snows , coupled with public conservation , have bettered our position from a reservoir low-point of 33.4 per cent of capacity on Dec. 12 . The winter 's precipitation in the city was 2.62 inches below average , while the winter of 1948-49 had precipitation 2.62 inches above average . On the other hand , we have had a winter 473 degree days warmer than average ; there has been less need to flush away snow on streets with water , and there has been less occasion for letting water run in cold-water flats to prevent freezing of pipes . Summing up the water developments of the last month , we find marked progress on only one front that promises even slender immediate relief . That is artificial rain-making . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiment , and yesterday some Ulster County residents brought preliminary court action to stop it . All hands agree  --  even the most ardent exponents  --  that it would be a mistake to rely on rain-making for any substantial change in the city 's water supply , although it is certainly worth a good try . A month ago City Hall was studying a revised water-metering plan for multiple dwellings . It is still studying it , and the Real Estate Board of New . York has agreed to go along , provisionally . Water consumption in January ran at the daily rate of 866,000,000 gallons and in February at 876,000,000 gallons . In January and February , 1949 , the figures were 1,143,000,000 and 1,161 , - 000,000 , so there were average daily savings , below a year ago , of 295,000,000 gallons in January and 267,000,000 in February . But in the week of Feb. 26 we used 897,000,000 gallons , the following week 893,000,000 gallons , and last week 891,000,000 gallons , so we are steadily exceeding the daily average of January and February in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on this degree of saving is indicated by the net reservoir gain reported yesterday , after substantial rains and snows of recent date . A oneday gain of 1,048,000,000 gallons was made at the reservoirs . But we need a gain of 1,660,000,000 gallons every day from now on if we are to have full reservoirs by June 1 . The most dismal aspect of this situation lies ahead , of course . We have " before us a clipping from this newspaper of last Aug. 12 . " City Use of Water at a Record Level , " says the headline . The news story goes on to say that on two recent days , during the summer hot spell , water use had risen above the 1,420,000 ; 000 gallons-per-day mark . This was 200,000,000 gallons a day above the then-normal . So , from the comparatively painless voluntary savings now , we can look ahead to a time in the heat of July and August when we would like to be using 545 , - 000,000 gallons more a day than we are using on the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barring a spring rainfall miracle ? is painful to contemplate . Closed swimming pools , closed hydrants for cooling the streets , closed taps for watering lawns and gardens  --  these and worse seem to be clearly in the picture . " We are a long way from home yet , " said the Water Commissioner recently , in assessing the results of the greatest reservoir gain in a ; Single day . We are , indeed , and we regret to say that our city officials are still prone to rely on a - mild rather than an energetic approach to our water problem
