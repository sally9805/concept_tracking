Dawn broke overcast and muggy over Nashville ( pop . 187,000 ) , the graceful and leisurely capital of the state of Tennessee . It was back-to-school week , and for the first time in the city 's history Negro children would go to school with white children . The way had been prepared carefully ; the integration would be selective and limited . Only twelve carefully chosen little Negro children , first-graders all , would go to five schools that were previously all white . But the air was charged with tension . " We are in the backwash of a thing that 's going on too close to us , " said School Superintendent W. A. Bass . " The Little Rock situation is giving the impression of possible victory to those people who would defeat the Supreme Court decision . " <P> Nashville 's city officials , though brought up for the most part to believe in racial segregation , were determined to preserve the law as a necessity of their community 's everyday life . " Desegregation , " said School Board Chairman Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become law , and we must learn to live with it . " Back of the local officials stood Tennessee 's Governor Frank Goad Clement , who called out the National Guard last year to enforce integration and the law in Clinton , Tenn. , and this year sharply turned down a segregationist delegation that urged him to follow the lead of Arkansas ' Orval Faubus . <P> " Pull Their Black Curls ! " Before 7 a.m. on back-to-school day crowds of white people began to gather outside the schools where Negro children had been registered-and it was clear that Nashville was in for serious trouble . There were scrawny , pinch-faced men in T shirts and jeans , vacant-faced women in curlers and loose-hanging blouses , teen-age boys in tight pants and greased ducktail hairdos . They flaunted Confederate flags and placards , e.g. , WHAT GOD HAS PUT ASUNDER LET NOT MAN PUT TOGETHER . <P> " Here come the niggers , " was the first battle cry as two six-year-old Negro girls in neat green dresses , their hair done up in braids , came into view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one white woman . As the Negro six-year-olds tripped quietly into the schools , the crowds grew wilder . A white waitress raised a tattooed arm , threw a rock and hit a Negro woman on the chest . A Negro woman guided her grandchild quietly through a gauntlet of hissing whites until she broke under the strain , undid one button of her blouse and drew a knife . " If any of you jump me , I 'm going to use this , " she cried . All pretense at education collapsed as the Battle of Nashville got under way . <P> " Bloodthirsty Race . " That evening white crowds concentrated outside the War Memorial Building beneath a granite-carved quotation from Woodrow Wilson : <P> America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured . <P>
