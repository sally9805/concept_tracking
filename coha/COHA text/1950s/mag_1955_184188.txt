Yugoslav Heretic <P> Sir : <P> . . . Mr. Ed Clark , your correspondent in Belgrade , came to see me for an interview . I told him that I had nothing further to add than had already been published in the London Times . . . Mr. Clark 's interview , as reported in your story Jan. 10 , repeats statements made by me in the London Times , but also makes statements which I did not make . <P> VLADIMIR DEDIJER Belgrade , Yugoslavia <P> TIME Correspondent Ed Clark , who has known Dedijer since wartime days , stands by his interview , but understands why Dedijer ( since given six months suspended sentence for " a criminal act of hostile propaganda " ) did not. - ED . <P> <P> The Upper Colorado <P> SIR : <P> HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING THE FIRST MAGAZINE OF NATIONAL CIRCULATION WILLING AND INTERESTED ENOUGH TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE UPPER COLORADO RIVER STORAGE PROJECT JAN. 31 . YOUR FACTS STAND OUT IN BOLD CONTRAST TO THE EMOTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION SPREAD AROUND THE COUNTRY BY THE PSEUDO-CONSERVATIONISTS AND WATER-GREEDY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " SALT LAKE CITY <P> Atheism on the Air <P> Sir : <P> Three cheers for Mrs. Margaret Knight and her BBC trilogy on scientific humanism and " Morals Without Religion " TIME , Jan. 24 . A breath of humanistic fresh air would do a world of good in our country , where the traditional orthodoxies have made a farce of morality . . . <P> <P> EDD DOERR Indianapolis <P> Sir : <P> . . . No doubt , Mrs. Knight must belong to the school that believes our ancestors were apes ( if Christ is a legend , what else can you believe ? ) , that our world came into being from revolving gaseous matter . Now if she could explain who put the swirling gas into existence , I might discover a grain of truth in her fantastic statements . <P> <P> EDWARD W. VERBA Campbell , Ohio <P> Sir : <P> ... I do n't criticize the BBC for carrying Mrs. Knight 's broadcasts , for she has a right to say what she will . Christianity has survived far worse dangers , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much the better . <P> <P> MARY MURPHY Indianapolis <P> The Case of Leo Frank <P> Sir : <P> Re the lynching of Leo Frank , as recounted in your Jan. 24 story , " A Political Suicide " : You mentioned that Leo Frank was a Jew ; however , you failed to state that the strongest factor in the incitement to lynch was antisemitism . I saw with my own eyes some of the handbills circulated in Atlanta at the time of the trial . . . Hate was mongered against all the Jews in town . . . My father was a Jew , living in Atlanta then . He endured the atrocity of the lynchers ' parade past his very own door on that fateful night . . . <P> The annals of history will echo this sin against God and his creatures unto eternity . . . May the memory of Governor John M. Slaton be a blessing to all who mourn his passing . <P> <P> HERMAN Russ Dayton <P> Sir : <P> . . . Why this dislike of the South ? Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss a shot . . . Your article on Governor Slaton 's death was only an excuse for publishing the incident about the lynching of Frank . Most of us would be glad to forget it . <P> <P> WM . T. SEIBELS Montgomery , Ala . <P> Sir :
