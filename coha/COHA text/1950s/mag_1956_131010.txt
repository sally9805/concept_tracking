Spring is here , and with it the Boston Red Sox and hope . Hope for the Red Sox is spelled T-E-D . It stands 6 feet 4 inches high , weighs at the moment a bulky 224 pounds and swings a baseball bat as perfectly as a herring gull flies . // Hope stood in short left field in Payne Park in Sarasota , Florida last week , flopping around after fly balls and grounders , smiling , talking with this player and joking with that one , laughing , sweating under the sun . People watching practice from the grandstand looked mostly at the batting cage and the man currently at bat , but eyes kept straying out to left field , and newcomers to the stands were nudged and told , " There 's Ted . That 's Ted Williams out there in left . " // When it was near time for his turn at bat , Williams loped in to the batting cage . He dropped his glove , picked up the little red shin guard he uses to protect his left leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strap it on . // Joe Reichler , an Associated Press sportswriter , was on the other side of the cage . // " Hi , Bush , " he said to Williams . Williams looked up from the shin guard , his face alert , and saw Reichler . // " Hi , Joe , " he said . He finished buckling the strap and walked over . // He stood leaning against the cage , making small talk , occasionally interrupting himself to comment on the action . Leo Kiely , the lean Boston left-hander , was on the mound . Williams indicated Kiely with a nod of his head . // " That guy there . He 's as thin as a damn rail . " // He shook his head as if in worry , like a parent disturbed by a child who wo n't eat . A batter hit a sharp line drive . // " Base hit , " Williams announced approvingly . " Dandy . " // A HARD SWING // Then it was his turn and he hopped into the cage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first pitch and took the second . He swung hard at the third pitch but missed it completely , grunting from the effort . // " Attaway , Bill ! " he called out to the pitcher . Then to himself : " Same old Williams . " // He popped one up , fouled one off , rapped two or three " base hits , " then swung and missed again . // " How can you miss those ? " he asked himself . He talked constantly while he was at bat , to the pitcher , to the catcher , to the other players around the cage . He set himself as Henry threw again . " I wo n't miss this one . " // He hit the ball hard but on the ground . // " One more , " he called out to Henry . // He topped it and it bounced off to the left . Williams jumped back into the batter 's box for still one more pitch . He set himself , swung hard and hit the ball with a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field and the outfielders turned to watch it drop beyond the fence . // Sammy White , the catcher , said slowly in open awe : " For God 's sake . " // " Nope , " said Williams , walking briskly out of the batter 's box and around to the back of the cage . " Did n't hit it good . " // Somehow , it did not appear that he had entirely convinced White , who was still looking at the distant outfield fence . // The high regard that Sammy White and the other members of the Boston Red Sox feel for Ted Williams is not based sorely on esthetic appreciation of Williams ' great skill with a bat , though no ballplayer could watch Williams ' hitting and not admire it . No , for the Red Sox the presence of Williams in spring training means something else : very possibly the fulfillment of a frequently frustrated dream . Yogi Berra of the New York Yankees was , with considerable logic , named Most Valuable Player in the American League last year , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league means more to his team 's chances of success than Theodore Samuel Williams . // A " YOUTH MOVEMENT " // For four seasons now ( this will be the fifth ) , the Red Sox have been pushing a " youth movement " designed to bring honor and quite possibly an American League championship to Fenway Park . It began in 1952 . That year , with Williams away in Korea flying a jet for the Marines , the great Red Sox team that had fought the Yankees tooth and nail for years finally came apart . Lou Boudreau , now with Kansas City but then manager of the Red Sox , wasted no time trying to nail things back together . He ripped out the deadwood on the roster and replaced it with a cargo of youthful innocents : Sammy White , 23 , Jimmy Piersall , 22 , Dick Gernert , 22 , Ike Delock , 22 , Ted Lepcio , 21 , Faye Throneberry , 20 , Bill Henry , 24 . White had played in four major league games prior to 1952 , Piersall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the majors. // They were too green . One day they would look great , the next day miserable . It was fun for a while and pretty exciting , but then they began to lose , and they lost much more often than they won . Capable veterans like Mel Parnell and Billy Goodman contributed good seasons , but the final result was disaster : sixth place , the worst , except for the war years , that a Red Sox team had finished since 1936. // But if the results were disastrous , the feeling about the future was bright with confidence . The argument in Fenway Park went like this : " The experience these kids are getting is invaluable . By the time Ted gets back , they 'll be ready , and with Ted we 'll have a great team . " More youngsters were added : Billy Consolo , Milt Bolling , Frank Sullivan , Tom Brewer , Tom Umphlett . Trades brought in Jackie Jensen and Grady Hatton . // But Ted never got back , not really . In 1953 he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season . ( He batted .407 and hit 13 home runs in that brief stretch . ) In 1954 he broke his collarbone on the first day of spring training , and before he was well enough to get back in the lineup ( he hit .345 , with 29 homers ) , the Red Sox were hopelessly behind . In 1955 , reluctant to sign a baseball contract until the financial details of his divorce were settled , he missed the first 46 days of the regular season and once again returned to a team that was out of the pennant race ( he hit .356 and 28 home runs ) . For three years the youthful Red Sox had acquired age and experience , but they finished fourth , fourth and fourth . // The fourth-place finish last season , however , had meaning . If earlier years had a gleam in the eye , this one was pregnant with the future . At the same time that Williams returned to the lineup , a catalyst named Billy Klaus  --  a journeyman infielder with eight years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jarred the infield and the team into cohesion . The Red Sox came alive and raged through the rest of the season like the club the Boston fans had so long hoped they would become . From deep in the second division they rose high enough to close in on the teams fighting for the pennant . // A TRULY SOLID TEAM // Now , in spring training , the Red Sox for the first time in five years have a truly solid team . Late-blooming , youth-movement boys like Lepcio and Gernert and Throneberry are still there , threatening to burst into stardom , but this season they are supported by a bedrock of proven skill in the infield and the outfield . Catcher Sammy White is , after Berra , probably the best catcher in the league . The pitching staff , led by 18-game-winner Frank Sullivan , was superb last year and has been bolstered since by the addition of Bob Porterfield and Johnny Schmitz from Washington . // More significantly , Mel Parnell appears to be back in shape . Parnell , who averaged 18 victories a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954 ( he won only three games all season ) and injured his knee last year ( he won only two ) . Last week , for the first time in a long , long while , he was throwing the ball with his natural overhand delivery . Parnell is almost too much . If he is indeed himself again , the Red Sox cup will run over . // Because , as any Boston fan will point out , beyond the solid infield and the brilliant outfield and the topflight catching and the deep pitching , Ted is there , too . And this year , for the first time since 1951 , he 'll be there right from the beginning .
