Since his student days at the University of Havana , Senator Eduardo Chibs , 43 , has been proclaiming and demonstrating his willingness to shed his blood for a cause or for his honor . He has fought numerous duels , including a saber engagement in 1947 with Carlos Prio Socarras , now President of Cuba . When someone fired a bullet at Chibs while he was making an open-air speech back in 1947 , he bared his chest and cried , " Go ahead and shoot ! The Ortodoxos need a martyr . " <P> " Ortodoxos " are members of Chibs ' own Cuban People 's Party . " Eddy " Chiba s was once an Autentico , a member of the Cuban Revolutionary Party , which has elected the last two Presidents of Cuba . But in 1947 he broke with the party , was soon denouncing Autentico officeholders as crooks and plunderers on his Sunday-night radio broadcasts . Cubans listened in fascination as Chibs assailed government graft and embezzlement . But he could never make his hottest accusations stick . For Chibs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People do n't believe me any more , " he said recently . <P> When he appeared at the CMQ studio for his regular Sunday broadcast this week , Chibs seemed depressed . He turned the microphone over to a friend , Jose Pardo Llada , who roasted the Autenticos for 20 minutes ; Chibs himself made only a short speech . He ended with : " People of Cuba , awake ! " Then he fumbled under the coat of his natty , double-breasted white suit , grasped his .38-cal. revolver , squeezed the trigger . The bullet ripped into his belly , shattering his spine . <P> As he was being rushed to a private clinic in a friend 's car , he glanced down at the ugly wound and mumbled , " It 's a shame it did n't go right through the heart . "
