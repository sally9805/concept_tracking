Land reform in Italy is a desperate human need and an almost insuperable problem . The Communists propose their usual Draconian solution : confiscate and redistribute large estates , eventually collectivize . The middleway Christian Democratic government of Premier Alcide de Gasperi rejects revolution for evolution . <P> For the past year De Gasperi has been pushing a comprehensive land reform act through Parliament . Its core : buy out large landholdings , cut them into small plots ( about 15 acres ) , help the peasantry to buy and cultivate them . The political , financial , administrative and technical difficulties are staggering . For example , some localities suffer now from too much fragmentation of land ownership ; in others , the land must first have irrigation , fertilizers , etc . The slowness of the government program led last fall and spring to peasant seizures of land , especially in southern Italy , where conditions are most depressing . Blood was shed , and the Communists shouted . To forestall similar incidents , De Gasperi has launched a preliminary installment of his land reform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now under way in Calabria , on the heel of the Italian peninsula . In an eroded hilly region , about 40 miles wide and 100 miles deep , where three rich absentee families owned tens of thousands of acres , mostly idle or undercultivated , hundreds of impoverished peasant families are getting new land and new hope . Last week TIME Correspondent William Rospigliosi saw the reform in progress at Santa Severina , a village near Crotone . His report : <P> <P> Skeptics &; Reformers .

A system that for generations had kept Santa Severinians hungry , thirsty , dirty , diseased and in despair could never end . Despite the local disbelief , Ente Sila ( government agency for land distribution and improvement ) patiently and doggedly pushed on . <P> Ente Sila had prepared a list of all peasants eligible for land . Beneficiaries must not own more than ten acres . Expropriated land had been charted according to productive value . Plots had been rearranged to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were to be assigned by the peasants ' drawing lots on appointed days . The lot-drawing had won unanimous peasant approval . " Man is imperfect , " observed one villager . " Only luck can assign each man the right piece of land . Only fortune can know what is best for each man in the future . " <P> At meetings between Ente Sila and Santa Severina 's people , each plot of land had been carefully discussed , each peasant had his say as to value . I was present at the meeting that preceded last week 's Sunday drawing . It was held in the moonlight , in front of the municipal hall . Professor Manlio Rossi-Doria , the energetic assistant chairman of the Sila Project , spoke from an open window :
