VICTORINE ( 380-pp. ) - Frances Parkinson Keyes-Messner ( $4.50 ) . <P> When Author Keyes showed Victorine 's first chapters to her British publisher , he came back with : " I am very much pleased with your mise-en-scne . However , I 'd like it a little more bloodcurdling . Could n't you have a murder in the rice fields ? " <P> Author Keyes could not . Fiction , as she suggests in her preface , must not be completely fictitious , and murders are " not rampant or even frequent " in Louisiana rice fields . So , instead , Author Keyes has made her tale turn on a murder in a rice bin . The victim is a fictional cabaret singer named Titine Dargereux ( " very good to look at , and the closer she came , the more alluring " ) . Cajun Titine titillates Rice Prince Prosper Villac , who " had her to himself beside a bayou " in return for a pair of gold slippers . So when Titine is found suffocated in the Villac rice mill , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prosper-and just at the moment that Prosper has got engaged to rich and beautiful Victorine LaBranche . Keyes fans will not be disappointed as they follow Victorine along a mysterious , lumbering course . Though most of the prose consists of what one character well calls " a potful of fancy-Dan wordage , " there are many stretches of an astonishing Louisiana dialect , for which Author Keyes declares herself indebted to a lady friend ( who has worked for the Opelousas daily World and has an " almost infallible ear for the nuances of local speech " ) . " I strive to please , " Novelist Keyes confesses . To a striving author , Victorine should be worth its weight in gold slippers.
